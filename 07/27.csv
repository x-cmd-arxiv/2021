language processing field, and recently inspires the emergence of
Transformer-style architecture design with competitive results in numerous
computer vision tasks. Nevertheless, most of existing designs directly employ
self-attention over a 2D feature map to obtain the attention matrix based on
pairs of isolated queries and keys at each spatial location, but leave the rich
contexts among neighbor keys under-exploited. In this work, we design a novel
Transformer-style module, i.e., Contextual Transformer (CoT) block, for visual
recognition. Such design fully capitalizes on the contextual information among
input keys to guide the learning of dynamic attention matrix and thus
strengthens the capacity of visual representation. Technically, CoT block first
contextually encodes input keys via a $3\times3$ convolution, leading to a
static contextual representation of inputs. We further concatenate the encoded
keys with input queries to learn the dynamic multi-head attention matrix
through two consecutive $1\times1$ convolutions. The learnt attention matrix is
multiplied by input values to achieve the dynamic contextual representation of
inputs. The fusion of the static and dynamic contextual representations are
finally taken as outputs. Our CoT block is appealing in the view that it can
readily replace each $3\times3$ convolution in ResNet architectures, yielding a
Transformer-style backbone named as Contextual Transformer Networks (CoTNet).
Through extensive experiments over a wide range of applications (e.g., image
recognition, object detection and instance segmentation), we validate the
superiority of CoTNet as a stronger backbone. Source code is available at

drug benefit-risk assessment (BRA) which allows for consistent comparisons by
summarising all benefits and risks in a single score. The MCDA consists of
several components, one of which is the utility (or loss) score function that
defines how benefits and risks are aggregated into a single quantity. While a
linear utility score is one of the most widely used approach in BRA, it is
recognised that it can result in counter-intuitive decisions, for example,
recommending a treatment with extremely low benefits or high risks. To overcome
this problem, alternative approaches to the scores construction, namely,
product, multi-linear and Scale Loss Score models, were suggested. However, to
date, the majority of arguments concerning the differences implied by these

such as hyperparameter optimization, policy optimization, and meta learning.
Although many bilevel optimization methods have been proposed, they still
suffer from the high computational complexities and do not consider the more
general bilevel problems with nonsmooth regularization. In the paper, thus, we
propose a class of enhanced bilevel optimization methods with using Bregman
distance to solve bilevel optimization problems, where the outer subproblem is
nonconvex and possibly nonsmooth, and the inner subproblem is strongly convex.
Specifically, we propose a bilevel optimization method based on Bregman
distance (BiO-BreD) to solve deterministic bilevel problems, which achieves a
lower computational complexity than the best known results. Meanwhile, we also
propose a stochastic bilevel optimization method (SBiO-BreD) to solve
stochastic bilevel problems based on stochastic approximated gradients and
Bregman distance. Moreover, we further propose an accelerated version of
SBiO-BreD method (ASBiO-BreD) using the variance-reduced technique, which can
achieve a lower computational complexity than the best known computational
complexities with respect to condition number $\kappa$ and target accuracy
$\epsilon$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point. We conduct data
hyper-cleaning task and hyper-representation learning task to demonstrate that

earlier shown that the said interaction provides an enhancement of cycle
efficiency for two spin-1/2 particles, with an upper bound which is tighter
than the Carnot efficiency. However, the necessary conditions governing engine
performance and the relevant upper bound for efficiency are unknown for the
general case of arbitrary spin magnitudes. Analyzing extreme-case scenarios, we
formulate heuristics to infer the necessary conditions for an engine with

as manual fact-checking is an onerous task in itself, therefore debunking

continual learning systems, which are presented with an on-line stream of
tasks. The field has attracted considerable interest and a diverse set of
methods have been presented for overcoming this challenge. Learning without
Forgetting (LwF) is one of the earliest and most frequently cited methods. It
has the advantages of not requiring the storage of samples from the previous
tasks, of implementation simplicity, and of being well-grounded by relying on
knowledge distillation. However, the prevailing view is that while it shows a
relatively small amount of forgetting when only two tasks are introduced, it
fails to scale to long sequences of tasks. This paper challenges this view, by
showing that using the right architecture along with a standard set of
augmentations, the results obtained by LwF surpass the latest algorithms for
task incremental scenario. This improved performance is demonstrated by an
extensive set of experiments over CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet, where it is also
shown that other methods cannot benefit as much from similar improvements.

be termed a `structural magnetic glass', without an a priori need for chemical

frustration on two levels, first producing a near-degenerate constrained
manifold inside which phase ordering kinetics is in turn frustrated. Our
results suggest that spin ice Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ provides one prototype of
magnetic glass formation specifically, and a setting for the study of
kinetically constrained systems more generally.

a lack of study on its causes. In this paper, we systematically explore and
reveal three causes for catastrophic forgetting in Class Incremental
Learning(CIL). From the perspective of representation learning,(i) intra-phase
forgetting happens when the learner fails to correctly align the same-phase
data as training proceeds and (ii) inter-phase confusion happens when the
learner confuses the current-phase data with the previous-phase. From the
task-specific point of view, the CIL model suffers from the problem of (iii)
classifier deviation. After investigating existing strategies, we observe that
there is a lack of study on how to prevent the inter-phase confusion. To
initiate the research on this specific issue, we propose a simple yet effective
framework, Contrastive Class Concentration for CIL (C4IL). Our framework
leverages the class concentration effect of contrastive learning, yielding a
representation distribution with better intra-class compactibility and
inter-class separability. Empirically, we observe that C4IL significantly
lowers the probability of inter-phase confusion and as a result improves the
performance on multiple CIL settings of multiple datasets.

STTran is flexible to take varying lengths of videos as input without clipping,
which is especially important for long videos. Our method is validated on the

superior performance of our method in terms of dynamic scene graphs. Moreover,

$\tau\to K_S\pi\nu_\tau$ decays within a general effective field theory
framework including four-fermion operators up to dimension-six. It is found
that, besides the commonly considered scalar-vector interference, the
tensor-scalar interference can also produce a non-zero $CP$ asymmetry in the
angular distributions. Bounds on the effective couplings of the non-standard
scalar and tensor interactions are obtained under the combined constraints from
the measured $CP$ asymmetries and the branching ratio of $\tau^-\to
K_S\pi^-\nu_\tau$ decay, with $\mathrm{Im}[\hat{\epsilon}_S]=-0.008\pm0.027$
and $\mathrm{Im}[\hat{\epsilon}_T]=0.03\pm0.12$, at the scale
$\mu_\tau=2~\mathrm{GeV}$ in the $\mathrm{\overline{MS}}$ scheme. Using the
best-fit values, we also find that the distributions of the $CP$ asymmetries
can deviate significantly from the SM expectation in almost the whole $K\pi$
invariant-mass region. Nevertheless, the current bounds are still plagued by
large experimental uncertainties, but will be improved with more precise
measurements from Belle II as well as the proposed Tera-Z and STCF facilities.
Assuming further that the non-standard scalar and tensor interactions originate
from a weakly-coupled heavy new physics well above the electroweak scale, the
$SU(2)_L$ invariance of the resulting SMEFT Lagrangian would indicate that very
strong limits on $\mathrm{Im}[\hat{\epsilon}_S]$ and
$\mathrm{Im}[\hat{\epsilon}_T]$ could also be obtained from the neutron
electric dipole moment and the $D^0-\bar{D}^0$ mixing. With the bounds from
these processes taken into account, it is then found that, unless there exist
extraordinary cancellations between the new physics contributions, neither the
scalar nor the tensor interaction can produce any significant effects on the
$CP$ asymmetries in the processes considered.

literature that analyse how baby boomers behave in the face of fake news. The
purpose of this study is to examine how female baby boomers deal with fake news
on Facebook and their available resources to learn how to identify and handle
dubious information. A qualitative study and thematic analysis were conducted
using information obtained from interviewing female baby boomers. Four themes
emerge from the analysis, revealing that participants recognise that they can
identify fake news but may not always be able to do so due to limitations in
their understanding of an issue or uncertainty about its source. Participants
show participants empirically develop critical identification and filtering
skills with the assistance from close family members.

P-Cygni in wind lines of OVI 1033A, NV 1240A and CIV 1550A that are indicative
of a young age of the starburst (<10 Myr). The spectrum is rich in stellar
photospheric features, for which a significant contribution of an AGN at these
wavelengths is ruled out. Low-ionization ISM absorption lines are also
detected, but are weak (EW0 ~ 1A) and show large residual intensities,
suggesting a clumpy geometry of the gas with a non-unity covering fraction or a
highly ionized ISM. The contribution of a foreground and AGN contamination to
the LyC signal is unlikely. Deep optical to Spitzer/IRAC 4.5um imaging show
that the spectral energy distribution of J0121+0025 is dominated by the
emission of the young starburst, with log(M*/Msun) = 9.9 +/- 0.1 and SFR = 981

photons can escape in sources with a wide range of UV luminosities and are not
restricted to the faintest ones as previously thought. These findings might
shed further light on the role of luminous starbursts to the cosmic

present a dialogue manager for interactive API search that considers search
results and dialogue history to select efficient actions. We implement two

reinforcement learning. We perform a synthetics evaluation and a human
evaluation comparing the policies to a generic single-turn, top-N policy used

lightcurve. Our noise model implements a robust treatment of outliers and
error-bar adjustments to account for additional variance or poorly-quantified

tiara of secondary rings, vortex sheets which flatten and interact iteratively,
or the violent disintegration of the rings into a turbulent cloud. The outcome
of the interaction is determined by the nature of the instability affecting two
impinging vortex rings. Here, we carry out a systematic study to determine the
dominant instability as a function of the parameters of the problem. To this
end, we numerically simulate the head on collision of vortex rings with
circulation Reynolds numbers between $1000$ and $3500$ and varying slenderness
ratios $\Lambda=a/R$ ranging from $\Lambda=0.1$ to $0.35$, with $a$ the core
radius and $R$ the ring radius. By studying the temporal evolution of the
energy and viscous dissipation, we elucidate the role azimuthal instabilities
play in determining what the outcomes of the collision are. We then compare
these collisions to the head-on impact of a vortex ring on a free-slip and a
no-slip wall. The free-slip wall imposes a mirror symmetry, which impedes
certain instabilities and at sufficiently large Reynolds numbers leads to the
formation of a half-tiara of vortices. Impact against a no-slip wall results in
the process where a secondary vortex ring is formed after the ejection of the
resulting boundary layer. When the Reynolds number is above a certain
threshold, which increases with $\Lambda$, the vortices disintegrate through
azimuthal instabilities, resulting in a turbulent cloud.

Previous studies showed that implicit and explicit feedback have different
roles for a useful recommendation. However, these studies either exploit
implicit and explicit behaviour separately or ignore the semantic of sequential
interactions between users and items. In addition, we go from the hypothesis
that a user's preference at a time is a combination of long-term and short-term
interests. In this paper, we propose some Deep Learning architectures. The
first one is Implicit to Explicit (ITE), to exploit users' interests through
the sequence of their actions. And two versions of ITE with Bidirectional
Encoder Representations from Transformers based (BERT-based) architecture
called BERT-ITE and BERT-ITE-Si, which combine users' long- and short-term
preferences without and with side information to enhance user representation.
The experimental results show that our models outperform previous

exploiting the implicit to explicit order as well as combining long- and

paradigms: contrastive and non-contrastive approaches. Their success can
largely be attributed to data augmentation pipelines which generate multiple
views of a single input that preserve the underlying semantics. In this work,
we introduce augmentation-augmented stochastic autoencoders (AASAE), yet
another alternative to self-supervised learning, based on autoencoding. We
derive AASAE starting from the conventional variational autoencoder (VAE), by
replacing the KL divergence regularization, which is agnostic to the input
domain, with data augmentations that explicitly encourage the internal
representations to encode domain-specific invariances and equivariances. We
empirically evaluate the proposed AASAE on image classification, similar to how
recent contrastive and non-contrastive learning algorithms have been evaluated.
Our experiments confirm the effectiveness of data augmentation as a replacement
for KL divergence regularization. The AASAE outperforms the VAE by 30% on
CIFAR-10, 40% on STL-10 and 45% on Imagenet. On CIFAR-10 and STL-10, the
results for AASAE are largely comparable to the state-of-the-art algorithms for
self-supervised learning.

reheating temperature scenario, we show that the magnetic energy spectrum is
strongly peaked at a particular wavenumber that depends on the reheating
temperature. Gravitational waves (GWs) are produced at frequencies between 3
nHz and 50 mHz for reheating temperatures between 150 MeV and 3x10^5 GeV,
respectively. At and below the peak frequency, the stress spectrum is always
found to be that of white noise. This implies a linear increase of GW energy
per logarithmic wavenumber interval, instead of a cubic one, as previously
thought. Both in the helical and nonhelical cases, the GW spectrum is followed
by a sharp drop for frequencies above the respective peak frequency. In this
magnetogenesis scenario, the presence of a helical term extends the peak of the
GW spectrum and therefore also the position of the aforementioned drop toward
larger frequencies compared to the case without helicity. This might make a
difference in it being detectable with space interferometers. The efficiency of
GW production is found to be almost the same as in the nonhelical case, and
independent of the reheating temperature, provided the electromagnetic energy
at the end of reheating is fixed to be a certain fraction of the radiation
energy density. Also, contrary to the case without helicity, the electric
energy is now less than the magnetic energy during reheating. The fractional
circular polarization is found to be nearly hundred per cent in a certain range
below the peak frequency range.

signals on such graphs. We propose to compare and organize such datasets of
graph signals by using an earth mover's distance (EMD) with a geodesic cost
over the underlying graph. Typically, EMD is computed by optimizing over the
cost of transporting one probability distribution to another over an underlying
metric space. However, this is inefficient when computing the EMD between many
signals. Here, we propose an unbalanced graph EMD that efficiently embeds the
unbalanced EMD on an underlying graph into an $L^1$ space, whose metric we call
unbalanced diffusion earth mover's distance (UDEMD). Next, we show how this
gives distances between graph signals that are robust to noise. Finally, we
apply this to organizing patients based on clinical notes, embedding cells
modeled as signals on a gene graph, and organizing genes modeled as signals
over a large cell graph. In each case, we show that UDEMD-based embeddings find
accurate distances that are highly efficient compared to other methods.

in the raw FITS files in a table-like GUI. Though the primary function of
DBSP_DRP is to automatically reduce an entire night of data without user input,
it has the flexibility for astronomers to fine-tune the data reduction with
GUIs for manually identifying the faintest objects, as well as exposing the
full set of PypeIt parameters to be tweaked for users with particular science
needs. DBSP_DRP also handles some of the occasional quirks specific to DBSP,
such as swapping FITS header cards, adding (an) extra null byte/s to FITS files
making them not conform to the FITS specification, and not writing the
coordinates of the observation to file. Additionally, DBSP_DRP contains a
quicklook script for making real-time decisions during an observing run, and
can open a GUI displaying a minimally reduced exposure in under 15 seconds.
Docker containers are available for ease of deploying DBSP_DRP in its quicklook
configuration (without some large atmospheric model files) or in its full
configuration.

molecular kinetics in 2D, single-and multi-component atmospheres on Callisto.
This expands on our previous study on the role of collisions in 1D atmospheres
on Callisto composed of radiolytic products (Carberry Mogan et al., 2020) by
implementing a temperature gradient from noon to midnight across Callisto's
surface and introducing sublimated water vapor. We compare single-species,
ballistic and collisional O2, H2 and H2O atmospheres, as well as an O2+H2O
atmosphere to 3-species atmospheres which contain H2 in varying amounts.
Because the H2O vapor pressure is extremely sensitive to the surface
temperatures, the density drops several order of magnitude with increasing
distance from the subsolar point, and the flow transitions from collisional to
ballistic accordingly. In an O2+H2O atmosphere the local temperatures are
determined by H2O near the subsolar point and transition with increasing
distance from the subsolar point to being determined by O2 When radiolytically
produced H2 is not negligible in O2+H2O+H2 atmospheres, this much lighter
molecule, with a scale height roughly an order of magnitude larger than that
for the heavier species, can cool the local temperatures via collisions. In
addition, if the H2 component is dense enough, particles originating on the
day-side and precipitating into the night-side atmosphere deposit energy via
collisions, which in turn heats the local atmosphere relative to the surface
temperature. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of this study on
the presence of H2 in Callisto's atmosphere and how the simulated densities
correlate with expected detection thresholds at flyby altitudes of the proposed
JUpiter ICy moons Explorer (JUICE) spacecraft.

tenuous regions of the upper atmospheres on planetary bodies. These simulations
track the motion of particles representing real atmospheric atoms and/or
molecules subject to collisions, the object's gravity, and external influences.
Because particles can end up in very large ballistic orbits, upper boundary
conditions (UBC) are typically used to limit the domain size thereby reducing
the time for the atmosphere to reach steady-state. In the absence of a clear
altitude at which all molecules are removed, such as a Hill sphere, an often
used condition is to choose an altitude at which collisions become infrequent
so that particles on escape trajectories are removed. The remainder are then
either specularly reflected back into the simulation domain or their ballistic
trajectories are calculated analytically or explicitly tracked so they
eventually re-enter the domain. Here we examine the effect of the choice of the
UBC on the escape rate and the structure of the atmosphere near the nominal
exobase in the convenient and frequently used 1D spherically symmetric
approximation. Using Callisto as the example body, we show that the commonly
used specular reflection UBC can lead to significant uncertainties when
simulating a species with a lifetime comparable to or longer than a dynamical
time scale, such as an overestimation of escape rates and an inflated
exosphere. Therefore, although specular reflection is convenient, the molecular
lifetimes and body's dynamical time scales need to be considered even when
implementing the convenient 1D spherically symmetric simulations in order to
accurately estimate the escape rate and the density and temperature structure
in the transition regime.

  - we develop an intrinsic theory of Laplacian bounds in viscosity sense and
in a pointwise, heat flow related, sense, showing their equivalence also with
Laplacian bounds in distributional sense;
  - relying on these tools, we establish a PDE principle relating lower Ricci
curvature bounds to the preservation of Laplacian lower bounds under the
evolution via the $p$-Hopf-Lax semigroup, for general exponents
$p\in[1,\infty)$. This principle admits a broad range of applications, going
much beyond the topic of the present paper;
  - we prove sharp Laplacian bounds on the distance function from a set
(locally) minimizing the perimeter with a flexible technique, not involving any
regularity theory; this corresponds to vanishing mean curvature in the smooth
setting and encodes also information about the second variation of the area;
  - we initiate a regularity theory for boundaries of sets (locally) minimizing

quantitative estimates of independent interest even in the smooth setting and
topological regularity away from the singular set.

data assimilation (4D-Var), the problem is formulated as a nonlinear

a long time-window is used in 4D-Var allowing more observations. The
difficulties GN encounters may lead to inaccurate initial state conditions for
subsequent forecasts. To overcome this, we apply two convergent GN variants
(line search and regularisation) to the long time-window 4D-Var problem and
investigate the cases where they locate a more accurate estimate compared to GN

owing to its length minimization, traverses through atypically low values of
the underlying noise variables, it is an important problem to quantify the
disparity between the environment rooted at a point on the geodesic and the
typical one. We investigate this in the context of $\gamma$-Liouville Quantum
Gravity (LQG) (where $\gamma \in (0,2)$ is a parameter) -- a random Riemannian
surface induced on the complex plane by the random metric tensor $e^{2\gamma

realization of $h$, the distributions of the appropriately scaled field and the
induced metric on a ball, rooted at a point ""uniformly"" sampled on $\Gamma$,
converge to deterministic measures on the space of generalized functions and
continuous metrics on the unit disk respectively. Moreover, we show that the
limiting objects living on the unit disk are singular with respect to their
typical counterparts, but become absolutely continuous away from the origin.
Our arguments rely on unearthing a regeneration structure with fast decay of
correlation in the geodesic owing to coalescence and the domain Markov property

compounded by the prevalent presence of missing data and heteroskedastic noise.
We propose a suite of solutions to perform valid inference on the principal
subspace based on two estimators: a vanilla SVD-based approach, and a more
refined iterative scheme called $\textsf{HeteroPCA}$ (Zhang et al., 2018). We
develop non-asymptotic distributional guarantees for both estimators, and
demonstrate how these can be invoked to compute both confidence regions for the
principal subspace and entrywise confidence intervals for the spiked covariance
matrix. Particularly worth highlighting is the inference procedure built on top
of $\textsf{HeteroPCA}$, which is not only valid but also statistically
efficient for broader scenarios (e.g., it covers a wider range of missing rates

$\mathbb{F}_2^n$. Sumsets play an important role in additive combinatorics,
where they feature in many central results of the field.
  The main result of this paper is a sublinear-time algorithm for the problem
of sumset size estimation. In more detail, our algorithm is given oracle access
to (the indicator function of) an arbitrary $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^n$ and an
accuracy parameter $\epsilon > 0$, and with high probability it outputs a value
$0 \leq v \leq 1$ that is $\pm \epsilon$-close to $\mathrm{Vol}(A' + A')$ for
some perturbation $A' \subseteq A$ of $A$ satisfying $\mathrm{Vol}(A \setminus
A') \leq \epsilon.$ It is easy to see that without the relaxation of dealing
with $A'$ rather than $A$, any algorithm for estimating $\mathrm{Vol}(A+A)$ to
any nontrivial accuracy must make $2^{\Omega(n)}$ queries. In contrast, we give
an algorithm whose query complexity depends only on $\epsilon$ and is
completely independent of the ambient dimension $n$.

temperatures, near-infrared colors, and surface gravities. Thus, the detailed
characterization of young brown dwarfs might shed light on the study of giant
exoplanets, that we are currently unable to observe with sufficient
signal-to-noise to allow precise characterization of their atmospheres. 2MASS
J22081363+2921215 is a young L3 brown dwarf, member of the beta-Pictoris young
moving group (23 +/-3 Myr), that shares its effective temperature and mass with
the beta Pictoris b giant exoplanet. We performed a ~2.5 hr spectro-photometric
J-band monitoring of 2MASS J22081363+2921215 with the MOSFIRE multi-object
spectrograph, installed at the Keck I telescope. We measured a minimum
variability amplitude of 3.22 +/- 0.42 % for its J-band light curve. The ratio
between the maximum and the minimum flux spectra of 2MASS J22081363+2921215
shows a weak wavelength dependence and a potential enhanced variability
amplitude in the alkali lines. Further analysis suggests that the variability
amplitude on the alkali lines is higher than the overall variability amplitude
(4.5-11 %, depending on the lines). The variability amplitudes in these lines
are lower if we degrade the resolution of the original MOSFIRE spectra to
R~100, which explains why this potential enhanced variability in the alkali
lines has not been found previously in HST/WFC3 light curves. Using
radiative-transfer models, we obtained the different cloud layers that might be
introducing the spectro-photometric variability we observe for 2MASS
J22081363+2921215, that further support the measured enhanced variability
amplitude in the alkali lines. We provide an artistic recreation of the

  arXiv:2012.05899",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unsupervised pretraining has achieved great success and many recent works
have shown unsupervised pretraining can achieve comparable or even slightly
better transfer performance than supervised pretraining on downstream target
datasets. But in this paper, we find this conclusion may not hold when the
target dataset has very few labeled samples for finetuning, \ie, few-label
transfer. We analyze the possible reason from the clustering perspective: 1)
The clustering quality of target samples is of great importance to few-label
transfer; 2) Though contrastive learning is essential to learn how to cluster,
its clustering quality is still inferior to supervised pretraining due to lack
of label supervision. Based on the analysis, we interestingly discover that
only involving some unlabeled target domain into the unsupervised pretraining
can improve the clustering quality, subsequently reducing the transfer
performance gap with supervised pretraining. This finding also motivates us to
propose a new progressive few-label transfer algorithm for real applications,
which aims to maximize the transfer performance under a limited annotation
budget. To support our analysis and proposed method, we conduct extensive
experiments on nine different target datasets. Experimental results show our
proposed method can significantly boost the few-label transfer performance of
unsupervised pretraining.

peculiarities in their chemical compositions, from a slightly sub-solar iron
content, super-solar abundances of some atomic species (e.g. ionised chromium),
and atypical enhancements of [Ba/Fe], with values up to +0.7 dex. Regarding the
behaviour of the other $s$-process elements like yttrium, zirconium, lanthanum,
and cerium, there is general disagreement in the literature. In this work we
expand upon our previous analysis of a sample of five young open clusters
(IC2391, IC2602, IC4665, NGC2516, and NGC2547) and one star-forming region
(NGC2264), with the aim of determining abundances of different neutron-capture
elements, mainly CuI, SrI, SrII, YII, ZrII, BaII, LaII, and CeII. We analysed
high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectra of 23 solar-type stars observed
within the \textit{Gaia}-ESO survey. We find that our clusters have solar
[Cu/Fe] within the uncertainties, while we confirm the super-solar [Ba/Fe]
values (from +0.22 to +0.64 dex). Our analysis also points to mildly enhanced
[Y/Fe] values (from 0 and +0.3 dex). For the other $s$-process elements we find
that [X/Fe] ratios are solar at all ages. It is not possible to reconcile the
anomalous behaviour of Ba and Y at young ages with standard stellar yields and
Galactic chemical evolution model predictions. Thus, we explore different
possible scenarios related to the behaviour of spectral lines, from the
sensitivity to the presence of magnetic fields to the first ionisation
potential effect. We also investigate the possibility that they may arise from
alterations of the structure of the stellar photosphere due to higher levels of
activity in such young stars. We are still unable to explain these
enhancements, but we suggest that other elements (i.e. La) might be more
reliable tracer of the $s$-process at young ages and encourage further
observations.

effect of this charge is to nullify the electric field structures which drive
the BZ mechanism. Since jets are now observed in a wide variety of classes of

uncertainties in the mass profiles of the main deflector galaxies. Strongly
lensed supernovae (glSNe) can provide, in addition to measurable time delays,
lensing magnification constraints when knowledge about the unlensed apparent
brightness of the explosion is imposed. We present a hierarchical Bayesian
framework to combine a dataset of SNe that are not strongly lensed and a
dataset of strongly lensed SNe with measured time delays. We jointly constrain
(i) $H_0$ using the time delays as an absolute distance indicator, (ii) the
lens model profiles using the magnification ratio of lensed and unlensed fluxes
on the population level and (iii) the unlensed apparent magnitude distribution
of the SNe population and the redshift-luminosity relation of the relative
expansion history of the Universe. We apply our joint inference framework on a
future expected data set of glSNe, and forecast that a sample of 144 glSNe of
Type~Ia with well measured time series and imaging data will measure $H_0$ to
1.5\%. We discuss strategies to mitigate systematics associated with using
absolute flux measurements of glSNe to constrain the mass density profiles.
Using the magnification of SNe images is a promising and complementary
alternative to using stellar kinematics. Future surveys, such as the Rubin and
\textit{Roman} observatories, will be able to discover the necessary number of
glSNe, and with additional follow-up observations this methodology will provide
precise constraints on mass profiles and $H_0$.

studying the interplay between topology and strong correlations such as in
topological Kondo insulators or Weyl-Kondo semimetals. The nature of these
systems requires the use of non-perturbative techniques which are few in
number, especially in high dimensions. Motivated by this we study a model of
Dirac fermions in $3+1$ dimensions coupled to an arbitrary array of spins via a
generalization of functional non-Abelian bosonization. We show that there
exists an exact transformation of the fermions which allows us to write the
system as decoupled free fermions and interacting spins. This decoupling
transformation consists of a local chiral, Weyl and Lorentz transformation
parameterized by solutions to a set of nonlinear differential equations which
order by order takes the form of Maxwell's equations with the spins acting as
sources. Owing to its chiral and Weyl components this transformation is
anomalous and generates a contribution to the action. From this we obtain the
effective action for the spins and expressions for the anomalous transport in
the system. In the former we find that the coupling to the fermions generates
kinetic terms for the spins, a long ranged interaction and a Wess-Zumino like
term. In the latter we find generalizations of the chiral magnetic and Hall
effects.

three-dimensional CFTs contains a constant universal term, $-F \subset
S_{\text{EE}}$. For a disk region, $F|_{\rm disk}\equiv F_0$ coincides with the
free energy on $\mathbb{S}^3$ and provides an RG-monotone for general theories.
As opposed to the analogous quantity in four dimensions, the value of $F$
generally depends in a complicated (and non-local) way on the geometry of the
region and the theory under consideration. For small geometric deformations of
the disk in general CFTs as well as for arbitrary regions in holographic

argue that $F$ is globally minimized by disks with respect to arbitrary regions

improved to $F \geq n_B F_0$. In addition, we provide accurate approximations

positive-operator-valued measure (POVM) can be performed for any spin system by
continuous isotropic measurement of the three total spin components [E.
Shojaee, C. S. Jackson, C. A. Riofrio, A. Kalev, and I. H. Deutsch, Phys. Rev.
Lett. 121, 130404 (2018)]. The outcome probability distribution of the SCS POVM
for an input quantum state is the generalized $Q$-function, which is defined on
the 2-sphere phase space of SCSs. This article develops the theoretical details
of the continuous isotropic measurement and places it within the general
context of applying curved-phase-space correspondences to quantum systems,
indicating their experimental utility by explaining how to analyze this
measurement's performance. The analysis is in terms of the Kraus operators that
develop over the course of a continuous isotropic measurement. The Kraus
operators represent elements of the Lie group $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, a
complex version of the usual unitary operators that represent elements of
$\mathrm{SU}(2)$. Consequently, the associated POVM elements represent points
in the 3-hyperboloid $\mathrm{SU}(2)\backslash\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$. Three
equivalent stochastic techniques, path integral, diffusion (Fokker-Planck)
equation, and stochastic differential equations, are applied to show that the
POVM quickly limits to the SCS POVM. We apply two basic mathematical tools to
the Kraus operators, the Maurer-Cartan form, modified for stochastic
applications, and the Cartan decomposition associated with the symmetric pair
$\mathrm{SU}(2)\subset\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$. Informed by these tools, the
three stochastic techniques are applied directly to the Kraus operators in a
representation independent, and thus geometric, way (independent of any
spectral information about the spin components).

environments that host low- and intermediate-mass stars. These observations
suggest that these shells may be produced by isotropic stellar wind feedback
from young main-sequence stars. However, the driving mechanism for these shells
remains uncertain because the momentum injected by winds is too low to explain
their sizes and dynamics due to their low mass-loss rates. However, these
studies neglect how the wind kinetic energy is transferred to the ISM and
instead assume it is instantly lost via radiation, suggesting that these shells
are momentum-driven. Intermediate-mass stars have fast ($v_w \gtrsim 1000$
km/s) stellar winds and therefore the energy injected by winds should produce
energy-driven adiabatic wind bubbles that are larger than momentum-driven wind
bubbles. Here, we explore if energy-driven wind feedback can produce the
observed shells by performing a series of 3D magneto-hydrodynamic simulations
of wind feedback from intermediate-mass and high-mass stars that are placed in
a magnetized, turbulent molecular cloud. We find that, for the high-mass stars
modeled, energy-driven wind feedback produces $\sim$pc scale wind bubbles in
molecular clouds that agree with the observed shell sizes but winds from
intermediate-mass stars can not produce similar shells because of their lower
mass-loss rates and velocities. Therefore, such shells must be driven by other
feedback processes inherent to low- and intermediate-mass star formation.

probed through model-independent searches for pair-production via gluon fusion,
as well as through model-dependent complementary electroweak single production.
In this paper we study the potential to extend those searches for the partners
of the third-generation Standard Model quarks on the basis of their expected
chromomagnetic interactions. We discuss how current searches for ""excited""
bottom-quarks produced via $b$-gluon fusion through chromomagnetic interactions
are relevant, and provide significant constraints. We then explore the region
of the parameter space in which the bottom-quark partner is heavier than the
top-quark partner, in which case the top-partner can be primarily produced via
the decay of the bottom-partner. Next, we probe the potential of the production
of a single top-quark partner in association with an ordinary top-quark by
gluon-fusion. Kinematically these two new processes are similar, and they yield
the production of a heavy top partner and a lighter Standard Model state, a
pattern which allows for the rejection of the associated dominant Standard
Model backgrounds. We examine the sensitivity of these modes in the case where
the top-partner subsequently decays to a Higgs boson and an ordinary top-quark,
and we demonstrate that these new channels have the potential of extending and
complementing the conventional strategies at LHC run III and at the
high-luminosity phase of the LHC. In this last case, we find that partner
masses that range up to about 3 TeV can be reached. This substantially expands
the expected mass reach for these new states, including regions of parameter

of stellar light causing a translation of the spectrum across the focal plane
array by many pixels. The wavelength shift allows absorption lines to
experience different optical propagation paths and aberrations over observing
epochs. We use physical optics propagation simulations to study the impact of
aberrations on precise Doppler measurements made by diffraction-limited,
high-resolution spectrographs. We quantify the uncertainties that
cross-correlation techniques introduce in the presence of aberrations and
barycentric RV shifts. We find that aberrations which shift the PSF
photo-center in the dispersion direction, in particular primary horizontal coma
and trefoil, are the most concerning. To maintain aberration-induced RV errors
less than 10 cm/s, phase errors for these particular aberrations must be held
well below 0.05 waves at the instrument operating wavelength. Our simulations
further show that wavelength calibration only partially compensates for
instrumental drifts, owing to a behavioral difference between how
cross-correlation techniques handle aberrations between starlight versus
calibration light. Identifying subtle physical effects that influence RV errors
will help ensure that diffraction-limited planet-finding spectrographs are able
to reach their full scientific potential.

Baer-Nunziato type model well-suited to weakly compressible multiphase flows.
The model can easily deal with different equation of states and it includes
relaxation terms characterized by user-defined finite parameters, which drive
the pressure and velocity of each phase toward the equilibrium. There is no
clear notion of speed of sound, and thus, most of the classical low Mach
approximation cannot easily be cast in this context. The proposed solution
strategy consists of two operators: a semi-implicit finite-volume solver for
the hyperbolic part and an ODE integrator for the relaxation processes. Being
the acoustic terms in the hyperbolic part integrated implicitly, the stability
condition on the time step is lessened. The discretization of non-conservative
terms involving the gradient of the volume fraction fulfills by construction
the non-disturbance condition on pressure and velocity to avoid oscillations
across the multimaterial interfaces. The developed simulation tool is validated
through one-dimensional simulations of shock-tube and Riemann-problems,
involving water-aluminum and water-air mixtures, vapor-liquid mixture of water
and of carbon dioxide, and almost pure flows. The numerical results match
analytical and reference ones, except some expected discrepancies across
shocks, which however remain acceptable (errors within some percentage points).
All tests were performed with acoustic CFL numbers greater than one, and no
stability issues arose, even for CFL greater than 10. The effects of different
values of relaxation parameters and of different amount equations of state --
stiffened gas and Peng-Robinson -- were investigated.

an optimization problem with constraints on tensor ranks, we leverage ADMM
technique to systemically solve this optimization problem in an iterative way.
During this procedure, the entire DNN model is trained in the original
structure instead of TT format, but gradually enjoys the desired low tensor
rank characteristics. We then decompose this uncompressed model to TT format
and fine-tune it to finally obtain a high-accuracy TT-format DNN model. Our
framework is very general, and it works for both CNNs and RNNs, and can be
easily modified to fit other tensor decomposition approaches. We evaluate our

biosignature gas, primarily because terrestrial planets have no significant
known abiotic NH3 source. The conditions required for NH3 to accumulate in the
atmosphere are, however, stringent. NH3's high water solubility and high
bio-useability likely prevent NH3 from accumulating in the atmosphere to
detectable levels unless life is a net source of NH3 and produces enough NH3 to
saturate the surface sinks. Only then can NH3 accumulate in the atmosphere with
a reasonable surface production flux.
  For the highly favorable planetary scenario of terrestrial planets with
H2-dominated atmospheres orbiting M dwarf stars (M5V), we find a minimum of
about 5 ppm column-averaged mixing ratio is needed for NH3 to be detectable
with JWST, considering a 10 ppm JWST systematic noise floor. When the surface
is saturated with NH3 (i.e., there are no NH3-removal reactions on the
surface), the required biological surface flux to reach 5 ppm is on the order
of 10^10 molecules cm-2 s-1, comparable to the terrestrial biological
production of CH4. However, when the surface is unsaturated with NH3, due to
additional sinks present on the surface, life would have to produce NH3 at
surface flux levels on the order of 10^15 molecules cm-2 s-1 (approx. 4.5x10^6
Tg year-1). This value is roughly 20,000 times greater than the biological
production of NH3 on Earth and about 10,000 times greater than Earth's CH4
biological production.
  Volatile amines have similar solubilities and reactivities to NH3 and hence

  Processes in Small and Medium-Sized Development Organizations",,,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Purpose: Microservice Architecture (MSA) denotes an increasingly popular
architectural style in which business capabilities are wrapped into
autonomously developable and deployable software components called
microservices. Microservice applications are developed by multiple DevOps teams
each owning one or more services. In this article, we explore the state of how
DevOps teams in small and medium-sized organizations (SMOs) cope with MSA and
how they can be supported.
  Methods: We show through a secondary analysis of an exploratory interview
study comprising six cases, that the organizational and technological
complexity resulting from MSA poses particular challenges for small and
medium-sized organizations (SMOs). We apply Model-Driven Engineering to address
these challenges.
  Results: As results of the second analysis, we identify the challenge areas
of building and maintaining a common architectural understanding, and dealing
with deployment technologies. To support DevOps teams of SMOs in coping with
these challenges, we present a model-driven workflow based on LEMMA - the
Language Ecosystem for Modeling Microservice Architecture. To implement the
workflow, we extend LEMMA with the functionality to (i) generate models from
API documentation; (ii) reference remote models owned by other teams; (iii)
generate deployment specifications; and (iv) generate a visual representation
of the overall architecture.
  Conclusion: We validate the model-driven workflow and our extensions to LEMMA
through a case study showing that the added functionality to LEMMA can bring
efficiency gains for DevOps teams. To develop best practices for applying our
workflow to maximize efficiency in SMOs, we plan to conduct more empirical
research in the field in the future.

  It is well known that free groups satisfy the Howson property (the

generated). We show that Howson property is indeed the only obstruction for
multiple intersection configurations to be realizable within $\mathbb{F}_n$.
  On the contrary, FTFA groups are well known to be non-Howson. We study
multiple intersections within FTFA groups, and we give an algorithm to decide,
given $k\geqslant 2$ finitely generated subgroups, whether their intersection
is again finitely generated and, in the affirmative case, compute a basis for
it. We also show that any finite intersection configuration is realizable in
$\mathbb{F}_n \times \mathbb{Z}^m$, for $n\geqslant 2$ and $m$ big enough. As a
consequence, we exhibit a finitely presented group where every intersection

depth range of indoor sequences varies a lot across different frames, making it
difficult for the depth network to induce consistent depth cues, whereas the
maximum distance in outdoor scenes mostly stays the same as the camera usually

which cause difficulties for the pose network, while the motions of outdoor

challenges and a set of good practices are consolidated for improving the
performance of self-supervised monocular depth estimation in indoor

effectiveness of each module is shown through a carefully conducted ablation

calculate the electromagnetic fields and potentials generated by moving point

oscillators. To calculate the total fields and potentials along a discretized
spatial grid at a specified time, PyCharge computes the retarded time of the
point charges at each grid point, which are subsequently used to compute the
analytical solutions to Maxwell's equations for each point charge. The Lorentz
oscillators are driven by the electric field in the system and PyCharge
self-consistently determines the reaction of the radiation on the dipole moment
at each time step. PyCharge treats the two opposite charges in the dipole as
separate point charge sources and calculates their individual contributions to
the total electromagnetic fields and potentials. The expected coupling that
arises between dipoles is captured in the PyCharge simulation, and the modified
radiative properties of the dipoles (radiative decay rate and frequency shift)
can be extracted using the dipole's energy at each time step throughout the
simulation. The modified radiative properties of two dipoles separated in the
near-field, which require a full dipole response to yield the correct physics,
are calculated by PyCharge and shown to be in excellent agreement with the
analytical Green's function results ($<0.2\%$ relative error, over a wide range
of spatial separations). Moving dipoles can also be modeled by specifying the
dipole's origin position as a function of time. PyCharge includes a
parallelized version of the dipole simulation method to enable the parallel
execution of computationally demanding simulations on high performance

estimator for optimization problems with uncertain linear objectives but known,
potentially non-convex, feasible regions. For more specialized optimization
problems where the feasible region is ""weakly-coupled"" in a certain sense, we
prove stronger results. Specifically, we provide explicit high-probability

bounds show that under mild conditions, the error of our estimator vanishes as
the dimension of the optimization problem grows, even if the amount of
available data remains small and constant. Said differently, we prove our

Recent developments on the concept have taken place in the emergent field of
quantum thermodynamics, where work is frequently characterized as a stochastic
variable. Notwithstanding this remarkable progress, it is still debatable
whether some sensible notion of work can be posed for a strictly quantum
instance involving a few-particle system prepared in a pure state and abandoned
to its closed autonomous dynamics. By treating work as a quantum mechanical
observable with a well defined classical limit, here we show that this scenario
can be satisfactorily materialized. We prove, by explicit examples, that one
can indeed assign eigensystems to work operators. This paves the way for
frameworks involving quantum superposition and nonlocal steering of work. We
also show that two-point measurement protocols can be inappropriate to describe
work (and other two-time physical quantities), especially in the semiclassical
regime. However subtle it may be, our quantum mechanical notion of work is
experimentally testable and requires an updating of our intuition regarding the
concept of two-time elements of reality. In this context, we derive a
work-energy uncertainty relation, and we illustrate how energy conservation
emerges as an element of physical reality.

from the decays of the heavy fermions in the Type-III seesaw extension of the
Standard Model at the LHC/FCC and the muon collider. The displaced heavy
fermions and the Higgs boson can be traced back by measuring the displaced
charged tracks of the charged leptons along with the $b$-jets. A very small
Yukawa coupling can lead to two successive displaced decays which makes the
phenomenology even more interesting. The prospects of the transverse and
longitudinal displaced decay lengths are extensively studied in the context of
the boost at the LHC/FCC. Due to the parton distribution function, the
longitudinal boosts leads to larger displacement compared to the transverse
one, which can reach MATHUSLA and beyond. The longitudinal measurements are
indeed possible by the visible part of the finalstate, which captures the
complete information about the longitudinal momenta. The comparative studies
are made at the LHC/FCC with the centre of mass energies of 14, 27 and 100 TeV,
respectively. A futuristic study of the muon collider where the collision
happen in the centre of mass frame is analysed for centre of mass energies of
3.5, 14 and 30 TeV. Contrary to LHC/FCC, here the transverse momentum diverges,
however, the maximum reach in both the direction are identical due to the
constant total momentum in each collision. The reach of the Yukawa couplings
and fermion masses are appraised for both the colliders. FCC at 100 TeV can

states, known as nuclear isomers, can store a large amount of energy over long
periods of time, with a very high energy-to-mass ratio. Under natural
conditions, the trapped energy is only slowly released, limited by the long
isomer lifetimes. Dynamical external control of nuclear state population has
proven so far very challenging, despite ground-breaking incentives for a clean
and efficient energy storage solution. Here, we describe a protocol to achieve
the external control of the isomeric nuclear decay by using electrons whose
wavefunction has been especially designed and reshaped on demand. Recombination
of these electrons into the atomic shell around the isomer can lead to the
controlled release of the stored nuclear energy. On the example of $^{93m}$Mo,
we show that the use of tailored electron vortex beams increases the depletion
by four orders of magnitude compared to the spontaneous nuclear decay of the
isomer. Furthermore, specific orbitals can sustain an enhancement of the
recombination cross section for vortex electron beams by as much as six orders
of magnitude, providing a handle for manipulating the capture mechanism. These
findings open new prospects for controlling the interplay between atomic and
nuclear degrees of freedom, with potential energy-related and high-energy
radiation sources applications.

This problem has attracted a growing interest in distributed sensing systems,

Furthermore, AGMA does not require power control or beamforming to cancel the

convex case, we show that AGMA approaches the best-known linear convergence

years, returning detections of the first Marsquakes. The lander also deployed a
meteorological instrument package and cameras to monitor local surface
activity. These instruments have detected boundary layer phenomena, including
small-scale vortices. These vortices register as short-lived, negative pressure
excursions and closely resemble those that could generate dust devils. Although
our analysis shows InSight encountered more than 900 vortices and collected
more than 1000 images of the martian surface, no active dust devils were
imaged. In spite of the lack of dust devil detections, we can leverage the
vortex detections and InSight's daily wind speed measurements to learn about
the boundary layer processes that create dust devils. We discuss our analysis
of InSight's meteorological data to assess the statistics of vortex and dust
devil activity. We also infer encounter distances for the vortices and,
therefrom, the maximum vortex wind speeds. Surveying the available imagery, we
place upper limits on what fraction of vortices carry dust (i.e., how many are
bonafide dust devils) and estimate threshold wind speeds for dust lifting.
Comparing our results to detections of dust devil tracks seen in space-based
observations of the InSight landing site, we can also infer thresholds and
frequency of track formation by vortices. Comparing vortex encounters and
parameters with advective wind speeds, we find evidence that high wind speeds
at InSight may have suppressed the formation of dust devils, explaining the
lack of imaged dust devils.

Protons exhibit the steepest spectrum of all the species, and helium, carbon,

silicon. These observations are difficult to explain as diffusive shock
acceleration, the currently most plausible theory for cosmic particle
acceleration at high energies, expects independence of the spectral index from

enhancement at supernova shocks in the uniform interstellar medium and in the

propose a simple, yet effective end-to-end depthwise encoder-decoder fully

that instead of applying a plain skip connection, a depthwise convolution of

merging the encoder and decoder features, thereby producing a sharpened
intermediate feature map of the same size as the encoder map. Using this
sharpening filter layer, we are able to not only fuse semantically less

(PCA), directly using an eigenmode decomposition of the varying constant during
recombination. After developing the formalism, we use Planck 2018 data to
obtain new VFC limits, showing that three independent VFC modes can be
constrained at present. No indications for significant departures from the
standard model are found with Planck data. Cosmic variance limited modes are
also compared and simple forecasts for The Simons Observatory are carried out,
showing that in the future improvements of the current constraints by a factor
of $\simeq 3$ can be anticipated.
  Our modes focus solely on VFC at redshifts $z\geq 300$. This implies that
they do not capture some of the degrees of freedom relating to the reionisation
era. This aspect provides important new insights into the possible origin of
the Hubble tension, hinting that indeed a combined modification of
recombination and reionisation physics could be at work. An extended PCA,
covering both recombination and reionisation simultaneously, could shed more
light on this question, as we emphasize here.

about the impact of factors other than the redox properties of the molecule on

situations they are even stronger than our first speed limit. Our results
establish that a stochastically evolving system will, on average, produce more

image content while minimally changing the most meaningful high frequency
content. To address this, we formulate an optimization problem using time-scale
(wavelet) representations as a dual space in three steps. First, we project
original images into orthonormal sub-spaces for low and high scales via wavelet
coefficients. Second, we perturb wavelet coefficients for high scale projection
using a generator network. Third, we generate new adversarial images by
projecting back the original coefficients from the low scale and the perturbed
coefficients from the high scale sub-space. We provide a theoretical framework
that guarantees a dual mapping from time and time-scale domain representations.
We compare our results with state-of-the-art black-box attacks from
generative-based and gradient-based models. We also verify efficacy against
multiple defense methods such as JPEG compression, Guided Denoiser and
Comdefend. Our results show that wavelet-based perturbations consistently
outperform time-based attacks thus providing new insights into vulnerabilities

selects the model that minimizes a weighted sum of absolute mean differences
between the imputed and original values of the covariates. The weights are
defined to leverage the covariate-outcome relationship, so that GPS models
without optimal variable selection are penalized. Under appropriate
assumptions, we show that the outcome-adjusted balance measure consistently
selects the optimal GPS model, so that the resulting GPS matching estimator is
asymptotically normal and efficient. We compare its finite sample performance
with existing measures in a simulation study. We illustrate an application of
the proposed methodology in the analysis of the Tutoring data.

participants (workers) may not trust each other fully; for instance, a set of
competitors may collaboratively train a machine learning model to detect fraud.
The workers provide local gradients that a central server uses to update a
global model. This global model can be corrupted when Byzantine workers send
malicious gradients, which necessitates robust methods for aggregating
gradients that mitigate the adverse effects of Byzantine inputs. Existing
robust aggregation algorithms are often computationally expensive and only
effective under strict assumptions. In this paper, we introduce LayerwisE
Gradient AggregatTiOn (LEGATO), an aggregation algorithm that is, by contrast,
scalable and generalizable. Informed by a study of layer-specific responses of
gradients to Byzantine attacks, LEGATO employs a dynamic gradient reweighing
scheme that is novel in its treatment of gradients based on layer-specific
robustness. We show that LEGATO is more computationally efficient than multiple
state-of-the-art techniques and more generally robust across a variety of

object models. We propose a novel Binary Extended Gaussian Image (BEGI), which
represents the point cloud surface normals of both object and robot fingers as
signals on a 2-sphere. Spherical harmonics are then used to estimate the
correlation between fingers and object BEGIs. The resulting spectral
correlation density function provides a similarity measure of gripper and
object surface normals. This is highly efficient in that it is simultaneously
evaluated at all possible finger rotations in SO(3). A set of contact points
are then extracted for each finger using rotations with high correlation
values. We then use our previous work, Local Contact Moment (LoCoMo) similarity
metric, to sequentially rank the generated grasps such that the one with
maximum likelihood is executed. We evaluate the performance of SpectGRASP by
conducting experiments with a 7-axis robot fitted with a parallel-jaw gripper,

not only can grasp individual objects, but also can successfully clear randomly
organized groups of objects. The SpectGRASP method also outperforms the closest

quantum computers and distributed quantum networks. A large number of
incoherent photons are thermally generated within the microwave frequency
spectrum. The closeness of the transmitted quantum state to the
source-generated quantum state at the input of the transmission link (measured
by the transmission fidelity) degrades due to the presence of the incoherent
photons. Hence, high-fidelity quantum microwave transmission has long been
considered to be infeasible without refrigeration [3,4]. In this study, we
propose a novel method for high-fidelity quantum microwave transmission using a
room-temperature lossy waveguide. The proposed scheme consists of connecting
two cryogenic nodes (i.e., a transmitter and a receiver) by the
room-temperature lossy microwave waveguide. First, cryogenic preamplification
is implemented prior to transmission. Second, at the receiver side, a cryogenic
loop antenna is placed inside the output port of the waveguide and coupled to
an LC harmonic oscillator located outside the waveguide. The loop antenna
converts quantum microwave fields (which contain both signal and noise photons)
to a quantum voltage across the coupled LC harmonic oscillator. The loop
antenna detector at the receiver is designed to extensively suppress the
induced photons across the LC oscillator. The signal transmittance is
maintained intact by providing significant preamplification gain. Our
calculations show that high-fidelity quantum transmission (i.e., more than 95%)
is realized based on the proposed scheme for transmission distances reaching
100 m.

uniform density. We identify several distinct dynamical phases as a function of
motor force and pinning density. At high pinning densities and high motor
forces, there is a two step process initiated by a rapid accumulation of both
active and passive disks in the pinned region, which produces a large density
gradient in the system. This is followed by a slower species phase separation
process where the inactive disks are shepherded by the active disks into the
pin-free region, forming a non-clustered fluid and producing a more uniform
density with species phase separation. For higher pinning densities and low
motor forces, the dynamics becomes very slow and the system maintains a strong
density gradient. For weaker pinning and large motor forces, a floating
clustered state appears and the time averaged density of the system is uniform.
We illustrate the appearance of these phases in a dynamic phase diagram.

paper, we tackle these limitations for the specific problem of few-shot full 3D

probabilistic shape prior that enables faster convergence and better
generalization when using few input images (down to three). First, we learn a
shape model of 3D heads from thousands of incomplete raw scans using implicit

networks to the scene, one modeling the geometry and another estimating the
surface radiance, using implicit differentiable rendering. We devise a
two-stage optimization strategy in which the learned prior is used to
initialize and constrain the geometry during an initial optimization phase.
Then, the prior is unfrozen and fine-tuned to the scene. By doing this, we
achieve high-fidelity head reconstructions, including hair and shoulders, and
with a high level of detail that consistently outperforms both state-of-the-art
3D Morphable Models methods in the few-shot scenario, and non-parametric

procedure and operational requirements of hotwire anemometry, e.g., constant
ambient properties and steady flow conditions. The combo probe-the combined
sonic-hotfilm anemometer developed and tested over the last decade-has
demonstrated its ability to overcome this hurdle. The old-er generation had a
limited wind alignment range of 120 degrees and the in-situ calibration
procedure was human decision based. This study presents the next generation of
the combo probe design, and the new fully automated in-situ calibration
procedure implementing deep learning. The elegant new design now enables
measurements of the incoming wind flow in a 360-degree range. The improved
calibration procedure is shown to have the robustness necessary for operation
in everchanging open field flow and environmental conditions. This is
especially useful with diurnally changing environments or non-stationary
measuring stations, i.e., probes placed on moving platforms like boats, drones,
and weather balloons. Together, the updated design and the new calibration
procedure, allow for continuous field measurements with minimal to no human

a large pool of field data to be collected to unravel the intricacies of all

hole binaries is currently controversial. While most properties are generally
explained in the truncated disc/hot inner flow model, the detection of a broad
residual around the iron line argues for strong relativistic effects from an
untruncated disc. Since spectral fitting alone is somewhat degenerate, we
combine it with the additional information in the fast X-ray variability and
perform a full spectral-timing analysis for NICER and NuSTAR data on a bright
low/hard state of MAXI J1820+070. We model the variability with propagating
mass accretion rate fluctuations by combining two separate current insights:
that the hot flow is spectrally inhomogeneous, and that there is a
discontinuous jump in viscous time-scale between the hot flow and variable
disc. Our model naturally gives the double-humped shape of the power spectra,
and the increasing high-frequency variability with energy in the second hump.
Including reflection and reprocessing from a disc truncated at a few tens of
gravitational radii quantitatively reproduces the switch in the lag-frequency
spectra, from hard lagging soft at low frequencies (propagation through the
variable flow) to the soft lagging hard at the high frequencies (reverberation
from the hard X-ray continuum illuminating the disc). The viscous time-scale of
the hot flow is derived from the model, and we show how this can be used to
observationally test ideas about the origin of the jet.

radial velocity exoplanet surveys, and compare those to the observed dust

that the apparent mass discrepancy disappears when accounting for observational

positive correlation between the masses of planetary systems and their

the doping granularity can become finer in terms of the protograph than the

redshift-space distorted mock galaxy catalogs. We use the linear point feature
in the monopole of the redshift-space distorted correlation function to
quantify the accuracy of our approach. We find that the linear point estimated
from the mock galaxy catalogs is insensitive to the details of the biasing
scheme at the sub-percent level. However, the linear point scale in the
nonlinear, biased, and redshift-space distorted field is systematically offset
from its scale in the unbiased linear density fluctuation field by more than
1%. In the Laguerre reconstructed correlation function, this is reduced to
sub-percent values, so it provides comparable accuracy and precision to methods
that reconstruct the full density field before estimating the distance scale.
The linear point in the reconstructed density fields provided by these other
methods is likewise precise, accurate, and insensitive to galaxy bias. All
reconstructions depend on some input parameters, and marginalizing over
uncertainties in the input parameters required for reconstruction can degrade
both accuracy and precision. The linear point simplifies the marginalization
process, enabling more realistic estimates of the precision of the distance
scale estimate for negligible additional computational cost. We show this
explicitly for Laguerre reconstruction.

reconstruction. However, because there are still some differences between the
two modalities, direct information transmission in the feature dimension or
edge map dimension cannot achieve satisfactory result, and may even trigger
texture copying in areas where the structures of the RGB-D pair are
inconsistent. Inspired by the multi-task learning, we propose a joint learning
network of depth map super-resolution (DSR) and monocular depth estimation
(MDE) without introducing additional supervision labels. For the interaction of
two subnetworks, we adopt a differentiated guidance strategy and design two
bridges correspondingly. One is the high-frequency attention bridge (HABdg)
designed for the feature encoding process, which learns the high-frequency
information of the MDE task to guide the DSR task. The other is the content
guidance bridge (CGBdg) designed for the depth map reconstruction process,
which provides the content guidance learned from DSR task for MDE task. The
entire network architecture is highly portable and can provide a paradigm for
associating the DSR and MDE tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets

this kind of stochastic nonlinear optimization problem. To address the

optimization strategy for the real-time operation of the microgrid.
Specifically, we construct the detailed operation model for the microgrid and
formulate the real-time optimization problem as a Markov Decision Process

solve the MINLP problem. The proposed approach can learn a near-optimal
strategy only from the historical data. The effectiveness of the proposed

the scale factor and the scalar field. The physical evolution of the field
equations depends upon three unknown functions which are related to the
scalar-tensor coupling function, the scalar field potential and the {\ae}ther

the field equations and the integrability properties according to the existence
of linear in the momentum conservation laws. We define a new set of variables
in which the dynamical evolution depends only upon the scalar field potential.
Furthermore, the asymptotic behaviour and the cosmological history is
investigated where we find that the theory provides inflationary eras similar

significantly lower the barriers for general users to rapidly create effective

specifications of visualization rules by visualization experts. Other machine
learning-based approaches often work like black-box and are difficult to
understand why a specific visualization is recommended, limiting the wider
adoption of these approaches. This paper fills the gap by presenting KG4Vis, a
knowledge graph (KG)-based approach for visualization recommendation. It does
not require manual specifications of visualization rules and can also guarantee
good explainability. Specifically, we propose a framework for building
knowledge graphs, consisting of three types of entities (i.e., data features,
data columns and visualization design choices) and the relations between them,
to model the mapping rules between data and effective visualizations. A
TransE-based embedding technique is employed to learn the embeddings of both
entities and relations of the knowledge graph from existing
dataset-visualization pairs. Such embeddings intrinsically model the desirable
visualization rules. Then, given a new dataset, effective visualizations can be
inferred from the knowledge graph with semantically meaningful rules. We
conducted extensive evaluations to assess the proposed approach, including
quantitative comparisons, case studies and expert interviews. The results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

a family of improper integrals containing only the real and imaginary parts of

Using this representation, a saddle point evaluation of the resistance distance
distribution is possible at N->infinity in terms of an 1/c expansion. The
leading order of this expansion captures the results of numerical simulations
very well down to rather small values of c; for example, it recovers the
empirical distribution at c=4 or 6 with an overlap of around 90%. At large
values of c, the distribution tends to a Gaussian of mean 2/c and standard
deviation sqrt{2/c^3}. At small values of c, the distribution is skewed toward
larger values, as captured by our saddle point analysis, and many fine features
appear in addition to the main peak, including subleading peaks that can be
traced back to resistance distances between vertices of specific low degrees
and the rest of the graph. We develop a more refined saddle point scheme that
extracts the corresponding degree-differentiated resistance distance
distributions. We then use this approach to recover analytically the most
apparent of the subleading peaks that originates from vertices of degree 1.
Rather intuitively, this subleading peak turns out to be a copy of the main
peak, shifted by one unit of resistance distance and scaled down by the
probability for a vertex to have degree 1. We comment on a possible lack of
smoothness in the true N->infinity distribution suggested by the numerics.

and expressive speech synthesis at scale. It does not require the target
speakers to be experts in expressing all styles and to collect corresponding
recordings for model training. However, the performances of existing style
transfer methods are still far behind real application needs. The root causes
are mainly twofold. Firstly, the style embedding extracted from single
reference speech can hardly provide fine-grained and appropriate prosody
information for arbitrary text to synthesize. Secondly, in these models the
content/text, prosody, and speaker timbre are usually highly entangled, it's
therefore not realistic to expect a satisfied result when freely combining
these components, such as to transfer speaking style between speakers. In this
paper, we propose a cross-speaker style transfer text-to-speech (TTS) model
with explicit prosody bottleneck. The prosody bottleneck builds up the kernels
accounting for speaking style robustly, and disentangles the prosody from
content and speaker timbre, therefore guarantees high quality cross-speaker
style transfer. Evaluation result shows the proposed method even achieves
on-par performance with source speaker's speaker-dependent (SD) model in
objective measurement of prosody, and significantly outperforms the cycle

time online object detection. We use the offline detection as a reference
model, and examine the root cause by analyzing the mismatch among the incoming
video streaming rate, video processing rate for object detection, and output
rate for real time detection visualization of video streaming. Second, we study
performance optimizations by exploiting multi-model detection parallelism. We
show that the model-parallel detection approach can effectively speed up the
FPS detection processing rate, minimizing the FPS disparity with the incoming
video frame rate on heterogeneous edge devices. We evaluate the proposed
approach using SSD300 and YOLOv3 on benchmark videos of different video stream
rates. The results show that exploiting multi-model detection parallelism can
speed up the online object detection processing rate and deliver near real-time
object detection performance for efficient video analytics at edge.

$\mu_1|u|^{p-2}u$,$\mu_2|v|^{q-2}v$ are of the so-called mass supercritical,
while the linear couple terms $\beta v, \beta u$ are of mass subcritical. An
essential novelty is that this is the first try to deal with the linear couples
in the normalized solution frame with mass mixed terms, which are big nuisances
due to the lack of compactness of the embedding $H^1(\R^N)\hookrightarrow
L^2(\R^N)$, even working in the radial subspace. For the Sobolev subcritical

  For the Sobolev critical case with $N=3,4$, it can be viewed as a counterpart
of the Brezis-Nirenberg critical semilinear elliptic problem for the system

we obtain the existence or non-existence of positive normalized ground state

cells have emerged as promising contenders for next generation, low-cost
photovoltaic technologies. Yet, the presence of nanoscale defect clusters, that
form during the fabrication process, remains critical to overall device
operation, including efficiency and long-term stability. To successfully deploy
hybrid perovskites, we must understand the nature of the different types of
defects, assess their potentially varied roles in device performance, and
understand how they respond to passivation strategies. Here, by correlating
photoemission and synchrotron-based scanning probe X-ray microscopies, we
unveil three different types of defect clusters in state-of-the-art triple
cation mixed halide perovskite thin films. Incorporating ultrafast
time-resolution into our photoemission measurements, we show that defect
clusters originating at grain boundaries are the most detrimental for
photocarrier trapping, while lead iodide defect clusters are relatively benign.
Hexagonal polytype defect clusters are only mildly detrimental individually,
but can have a significant impact overall if abundant in occurrence. We also
show that passivating defects with oxygen in the presence of light, a
previously used approach to improve efficiency, has a varied impact on the
different types of defects. Even with just mild oxygen treatment, the grain
boundary defects are completely healed, while the lead iodide defects begin to
show signs of chemical alteration. Our findings highlight the need for
multi-pronged strategies tailored to selectively address the detrimental impact
of the different defect types in hybrid perovskite solar cells.

of the ethyl chain, is on the origin of the crystallization being hampered
during cooling and the resulting glass-forming ability of [C2C1im][N(CN)2].

them attractive candidates for quantum information processing and inertial
sensing. When coupled to the spin of an optically-active electron, nuclear
spins can be rapidly polarized, controlled and read via lasers and
radiofrequency fields. Possessing coherence times of several milliseconds at
room temperature, nuclear spins hosted by a nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond
are thus intriguing systems to observe how classical physical rotation at
quantum timescales affects a quantum system. Unlocking this potential is
hampered by precise and inflexible constraints on magnetic field strength and
alignment in order to optically induce nuclear polarization, which restricts
the scope for further study and applications. In this work, we demonstrate
optical nuclear spin polarization and rapid quantum control of nuclear spins in
a diamond physically rotating at $1\,$kHz, faster than the nuclear spin
coherence time. Free from the need to maintain strict field alignment, we are
able to measure and control nuclear spins in hitherto inaccessible regimes,
such as in the presence of a large, time-varying magnetic field that makes an
angle of more than $100^\circ$ to the nitrogen-lattice vacancy axis. The field
induces spin mixing between the electron and nuclear states of the qubits,
decoupling them from oscillating rf fields. We are able to demonstrate that
coherent spin state control is possible at any point of the rotation, and even
for up to six rotation periods. We combine continuous dynamical decoupling with
quantum feedforward control to eliminate decoherence induced by imperfect
mechanical rotation. Our work liberates a previously inaccessible degree of
freedom of the NV nuclear spin, unlocking new approaches to quantum control and
rotation sensing.

overwhelming majority of the slots in each turn should simply inherit the slot
values from the previous turn. Therefore, the mechanism of treating slots
equally in each turn not only is inefficient but also may lead to additional
errors because of the redundant slot value generation. To address this problem,
we devise the two-stage DSS-DST which consists of the Dual Slot Selector based
on the current turn dialogue, and the Slot Value Generator based on the
dialogue history. The Dual Slot Selector determines each slot whether to update
slot value or to inherit the slot value from the previous turn from two
aspects: (1) if there is a strong relationship between it and the current turn
dialogue utterances; (2) if a slot value with high reliability can be obtained
for it through the current turn dialogue. The slots selected to be updated are
permitted to enter the Slot Value Generator to update values by a hybrid
method, while the other slots directly inherit the values from the previous
turn. Empirical results show that our method achieves 56.93%, 60.73%, and

second stage (task). In PVR, this is done by having one part of the task input
act as a pointer, giving instructions on a different input location, which
forms the output. We show this simple rule can be applied to create a diverse
set of tasks across different input modalities and configurations. Importantly,
this use of indirection enables systematically varying task difficulty through
distribution shifts and increasing functional complexity. We conduct a detailed
empirical study of different PVR tasks, discovering large variations in
performance across dataset sizes, neural network architectures and task
complexity. Further, by incorporating distribution shift and increased
functional complexity, we develop nuanced tests for reasoning, revealing subtle
failures and surprising successes, suggesting many promising directions of
exploration on this benchmark.

local resources (e.g., data-plans, computation and even energy resources),
device-to-device (D2D) resource sharing is a promising approach towards
realizing a sharing economy. In the resulting networked economy, $n$ users
segment themselves into sellers and buyers that need to be efficiently matched
locally. This paper adopts an easy-to-implement greedy matching algorithm with
distributed fashion and only sub-linear $O(\log n)$ parallel complexity, which
offers a great advantage compared to the optimal but computational-expensive
centralized matching. But is it efficient compared to the optimal matching?
Extensive simulations indicate that in a large number of practical cases the
average loss is no more than $10\%$, a far better result than the $50\%$ loss
bound in the worst case. However, there is no rigorous average-case analysis in
the literature to back up such encouraging findings, which is a fundamental
step towards supporting the practical use of greedy matching in D2D sharing.
This paper is the first to present the rigorous average analysis of certain
representative classes of graphs with random parameters, by proposing a new
asymptotic methodology. For typical 2D grids with random matching weights we
rigorously prove that our greedy algorithm performs better than $84.9\%$ of the
optimal, while for typical Erdos-Renyi random graphs we prove a lower bound of
$79\%$ when the graph is neither dense nor sparse. Finally, we use realistic
data to show that our random graph models approximate well D2D sharing networks
encountered in practice.

generally suffer from high computational complexity and/or low accuracy in
identifying working household appliances. This paper proposes an event-driven
Factorial Hidden Markov model (eFHMM) for multiple appliances with multiple
states in a household, aiming for low computational complexity and high load
disaggregation accuracy. The proposed eFHMM decreases the computational
complexity to be linear to the event number, which ensures online load
disaggregation. Furthermore, the eFHMM is solved in two stages, where the first
stage identifies state-changing appliance using transient signatures and the
second stage confirms the inferred states using steady-state signatures. The
combination of transient and steady-state signatures, which are extracted from
transient and steady periods segmented by detected events, enhances the
uniqueness of each state transition and associated appliances, which ensures
accurate load disaggregation. The event-driven two-stage NILM solution, termed
as eFHMM-TS, is naturally fit into an edge-cloud framework, which makes
possible the real-world application of NILM. The proposed eFHMM-TS method is
validated on the LIFTED and synD datasets. Results demonstrate that the
eFHMM-TS method outperforms other methods and can be applied in practice.

WS-TALtask-specific features, thus the feature re-calibration is needed for
reducing the task-irrelevant information redundancy. Therefore, we propose a
cross-modal consensus network (CO2-Net) to tackle this problem. In CO2-Net, we
mainly introduce two identical proposed cross-modal consensus modules (CCM)
that design a cross-modal attention mechanism to filter out the task-irrelevant
information redundancy using the global information from the main modality and
the cross-modal local information of the auxiliary modality. Moreover, we treat
the attention weights derived from each CCMas the pseudo targets of the
attention weights derived from another CCM to maintain the consistency between
the predictions derived from two CCMs, forming a mutual learning manner.
Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on two common used temporal action
localization datasets, THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.2, to verify our method and
achieve the state-of-the-art results. The experimental results show that our

self-supervision, which leverages domain knowledge to automatically annotate
noisy training examples for end applications, either by introducing labeling
functions for annotating individual instances, or by imposing constraints over
interdependent label decisions. We first present deep probabilistic logic(DPL),
which offers a unifying framework for task-specific self-supervision by
composing probabilistic logic with deep learning. DPL represents unknown labels

probabilistic logic to train a deep neural network end-to-end using variational
EM. Next, we present self-supervised self-supervision(S4), which adds to DPL
the capability to learn new self-supervision automatically. Starting from an
initial seed self-supervision, S4 iteratively uses the deep neural network to
propose new self supervision. These are either added directly (a form of

declare a connection anomalous if it expresses deviation from a trained model,
the unsupervised learning algorithms circumvent this issue since they have the

investigates an alternative yield-aware optimization for photonic ICs: we will
optimize the circuit design performance while ensuring a high yield
requirement. This problem was recently formulated as a chance-constrained
optimization, and the chance constraint was converted to a stronger constraint
with statistical moments. Such a conversion reduces the feasible set and
sometimes leads to an over-conservative design. To address this fundamental
challenge, this paper proposes a carefully designed polynomial function, called
optimal polynomial kinship function, to bound the chance constraint more
accurately. We modify existing kinship functions via relaxing the independence
and convexity requirements, which fits our more general uncertainty modeling
and tightens the bounding functions. The proposed method enables a global
optimum search for the design variables via polynomial optimization. We
validate this method with a synthetic function and two photonic IC design
benchmarks, showing that our method can obtain better design performance while
meeting a pre-specified yield requirement. Many other advanced problems of
yield-aware optimization and more general safety-critical design/control can be
solved based on this work in the future.

investigated for multi-input systems, where each input is generated by an agent
in a network. The input matrices are different and locally possessed by the
corresponding agents respectively, which can be regarded as different ways for
agents to control the multi-input system. By embedding a fully distributed
information fusion strategy, a novel cooperative LQR-based controller is
proposed. Each agent only needs to communicate with its neighbors, rather than
sharing information globally in a network. Moreover, only the joint
controllability is required, which allows the multi-input system to be
uncontrollable for every single agent or even all its neighbors. In particular,
only one-time information exchange is necessary at every control step, which
significantly reduces the communication consumption. It is proved that the
boundedness (convergence) of the controller gains is guaranteed for
time-varying (time-invariant) systems. Furthermore, the control performance of
the entire system is ensured. Generally, the proposed controller achieves a
better trade-off between the control performance and the communication
overhead, compared with the existing centralized/decentralized/consensus-based
LQR controllers. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical results is

sign language Transformer model achieves remarkable progress in Sign Language
Recognition (SLR) and Translation (SLT). However, there are several issues with
the Transformer that prevent it from better sign language understanding. The
first issue is that the self-attention mechanism learns sign video
representation in a frame-wise manner, neglecting the temporal semantic
structure of sign gestures. Secondly, the attention mechanism with absolute
position encoding is direction and distance unaware, thus limiting its ability.
To address these issues, we propose a new model architecture, namely PiSLTRc,
with two distinctive characteristics: (i) content-aware and position-aware
convolution layers. Specifically, we explicitly select relevant features using
a novel content-aware neighborhood gathering method. Then we aggregate these
features with position-informed temporal convolution layers, thus generating
robust neighborhood-enhanced sign representation. (ii) injecting the relative
position information to the attention mechanism in the encoder, decoder, and
even encoder-decoder cross attention. Compared with the vanilla Transformer
model, our model performs consistently better on three large-scale sign
language benchmarks: PHOENIX-2014, PHOENIX-2014-T and CSL. Furthermore,
extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on translation quality with $+1.6$ BLEU
improvements.

deep-learning-based end-to-end multichannel speech enhancement. We aim to train
a unique deep neural network (DNN) potentially performing well on unseen
microphone arrays. The microphone array geometry shapes the network's
parameters when training on a fixed microphone array, and thus restricts the
generalization of the trained network to another microphone array. To resolve
this problem, a single network is trained using data recorded by various
microphone arrays of different geometries. We design three variants of our
recently proposed narrowband network to cope with the agnostic number of
microphones. Overall, the goal is to make the network learn the universal
information for speech enhancement that is available for any array geometry,
rather than learn the one-array-dedicated characteristics. The experiments on
both simulated and real room impulse responses (RIR) demonstrate the excellent
across-array generalization capability of the proposed networks, in the sense
that their performance measures are very close to, or even exceed the network
trained with test arrays. Moreover, they notably outperform various beamforming
methods and other advanced deep-learning-based methods.

facilitates an elite agent to move efficiently through a crowd of inert agents.
When an object swims in a fluid medium or an intruder is forced through
granular matter, characteristic flow-fields are created around them. We show
that if inert agents, made small movements based on a traffic rule derived from
these characteristic flow-fields, they efficiently reorganize and transport
enough space for the elite to pass through. The traffic rule used in the
article is a dipole-field which satisfactorily captures the features of the
flow-fields around a moving intruder. We study the effectiveness of this dipole
traffic rule using numerical simulations in a 2D periodic domain, where one
self-propelled elite agent tries to move through a crowd of inert agents that
prefer to stay in a state of rest. Simulations are carried out for a wide range
of strengths of the traffic rule and packing density of the crowd. We
characterize and analyze four regions in the parameter space, free-flow, motion
due to cooperation, frozen and collective drift regions, and discuss the
consequence of the traffic rule in light of the collective behavior observed.
We believe that the proposed method can be of use in a swarm of robots working
in constrained environments.

and independent of the temporal interval scale adopted, implying a
scale-invariant structure of SGRs. These features indicate that SGR bursts may
be governed by a self-organizing criticality (SOC) process, confirming previous
findings. Very recently, 1652 independent bursts from FRB 121102 have been
detected by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST).
Here we also investigate the scale-invariant structure of FRB 121102 based on

similar statistical properties. Given the bimodal energy distribution of FRB
121102 bursts, we separately explore the scale-invariant behaviors of low- and

bimodality of the energy distribution. Scale invariance in both the high-energy

translating neural activity into digital commands to control external devices.
Neural adaptation, where the brain signals change in response to external
stimuli or movements, plays an important role in BMIs. When subjects purely use
neural activity to brain-control a prosthesis, some neurons will actively
explore a new tuning property to accomplish the movement task. The prediction
of this neural tuning property can help subjects adapt more efficiently to
brain control and maintain good decoding performance. Existing prediction
methods track the slow change of the tuning property in the manual control,
which is not suitable for the fast neural adaptation in brain control. In order
to identify the active neurons in brain control and track their tuning property
changes, we propose a globally adaptive point process method (GaPP) to estimate
the neural modulation state from spike trains, decompose the states into the
hyper preferred direction and reconstruct the kinematics in a dual-model
framework. We implement the method on real data from rats performing a
two-lever discrimination task under manual control and brain control. The
results show our method successfully predicts the neural modulation state and
identifies the neurons that become active in brain control. Compared to
existing methods, ours tracks the fast changes of the hyper preferred direction
from manual control to brain control more accurately and efficiently and
reconstructs the kinematics better and faster.

adopting online learning-based approaches for long-standing attack mitigation
issues. In particular, DDoS attacks remain a significant threat to network
service availability even after more than two decades. These attacks have been
well studied under the assumption that malicious traffic originates from a
single attack profile. Based on this premise, malicious traffic characteristics
are assumed to be considerably different from legitimate traffic. Consequently,
online filtering methods are designed to learn network traffic distributions
adaptively and rank requests according to their attack likelihood. During an
attack, requests rated as malicious are precipitously dropped by the filters.
In this paper, we conduct the first systematic study on the effects of data
poisoning attacks on online DDoS filtering; introduce one such attack method,
and propose practical protective countermeasures for these attacks. We
investigate an adverse scenario where the attacker is ""crafty"", switching
profiles during attacks and generating erratic attack traffic that is
ever-shifting. This elusive attacker generates malicious requests by
manipulating and shifting traffic distribution to poison the training data and
corrupt the filters. To this end, we present a generative model MimicShift,
capable of controlling traffic generation while retaining the originating
traffic's intrinsic properties. Comprehensive experiments show that online
learning filters are highly susceptible to poisoning attacks, sometimes
performing much worse than a random filtering strategy in this attack scenario.
At the same time, our proposed protective countermeasure diminishes the attack
impact.

statistics. Detection of excess noise at the edge is a smoking gun for the

devices. A noiseless dc current is injected at one of the edge contacts, and
the noise generated at contacts at $L= 4\,\mu$m or $10\,\mu$m away along the

we detect a strong noise proportional to the injected current, unambiguously
proving the existence of upstream modes. The noise magnitude remaining
independent of length together with a remarkable agreement with our theoretical
analysis demonstrates the ballistic nature of upstream energy transport, quite

Localization (TAL) requires to not only precisely locate the temporal

locating the action instances using only video-level class labels. In this
paper, to train a supervised temporal action localizer, we adopt Temporal

through ``local and global"" temporal context aggregation and complementary as
well as progressive boundary refinement. As for the WSTAL, a novel framework is
proposed to handle the poor quality of CAS generated by simple classification
network, which can only focus on local discriminative parts, rather than locate
the entire interval of target actions. Further inspired by the transfer
learning method, we also adopt an additional module to transfer the knowledge
from trimmed videos (HACS Clips dataset) to untrimmed videos (HACS Segments

  for Crowd Counting","To be appear in ICCV2021",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, the problem of inaccurate learning targets in crowd counting draws
increasing attention. Inspired by a few pioneering work, we solve this problem
by trying to predict the indices of pre-defined interval bins of counts instead
of the count values themselves. However, an inappropriate interval setting
might make the count error contributions from different intervals extremely
imbalanced, leading to inferior counting performance. Therefore, we propose a
novel count interval partition criterion called Uniform Error Partition (UEP),
which always keeps the expected counting error contributions equal for all
intervals to minimize the prediction risk. Then to mitigate the inevitably
introduced discretization errors in the count quantization process, we propose
another criterion called Mean Count Proxies (MCP). The MCP criterion selects
the best count proxy for each interval to represent its count value during
inference, making the overall expected discretization error of an image nearly
negligible. As far as we are aware, this work is the first to delve into such a
classification task and ends up with a promising solution for count interval
partition. Following the above two theoretically demonstrated criterions, we
propose a simple yet effective model termed Uniform Error Partition Network
(UEPNet), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several challenging
datasets. The codes will be available at:

of microring resonators is indispensable, ranging from tailoring laser

dispersive effects. Here, we propose an experimentally feasible platform to
realize on-chip selective depletion of single resonance in microring with
decoupled dispersion and dissipation, which are usually entangled by
Kramer-Kroning relation. Thanks to the existence of non-Hermitian singularity,
unsplit but significantly increased dissipation of the selected resonance is
achieved due to the simultaneous collapse of eigenvalues and eigenvectors,
fitting elegantly the requirement of pure single-mode depletion. With delicate
yet experimentally feasible parameters, we show explicit evidence of modulation
instability as well as deterministic single soliton generation in
microresonators induced by depletion in normal and anomalous dispersion regime,
respectively. Our findings connect non-Hermitian singularities to wide range of
applications associated with selective single mode manipulation in microwave

is to discover generalized normal patterns by capturing spatial-temporal
correlation in multi-sensor data. Beyond this challenge, the noisy data is
often intertwined with the training data, which is likely to mislead the model
by making it hard to distinguish between the normal, abnormal, and noisy data.
Few of previous researches can jointly address these two challenges. In this
paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based anomaly detection algorithm
called Deep Convolutional Autoencoding Memory network (CAE-M). We first build a
Deep Convolutional Autoencoder to characterize spatial dependence of
multi-sensor data with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to better distinguish

empirically compare the proposed approach with several state-of-the-art anomaly

significant impact on NLP, training PrLMs in languages other than English can
be impractical for two reasons: other languages often lack corpora sufficient
for training powerful PrLMs, and because of the commonalities among human
languages, computationally expensive PrLM training for different languages is
somewhat redundant. In this work, building upon the recent works connecting
cross-lingual model transferring and neural machine translation, we thus
propose a novel cross-lingual model transferring framework for PrLMs: TreLM. To
handle the symbol order and sequence length differences between languages, we
propose an intermediate ``TRILayer"" structure that learns from these
differences and creates a better transfer in our primary translation direction,
as well as a new cross-lingual language modeling objective for transfer
training. Additionally, we showcase an embedding aligning that adversarially
adapts a PrLM's non-contextualized embedding space and the TRILayer structure
to learn a text transformation network across languages, which addresses the
vocabulary difference between languages. Experiments on both language
understanding and structure parsing tasks show the proposed framework
significantly outperforms language models trained from scratch with limited
data in both performance and efficiency. Moreover, despite an insignificant
performance loss compared to pre-training from scratch in resource-rich
scenarios, our cross-lingual model transferring framework is significantly more
economical.

discriminate gases, which re-motivates using conducting polymers as a class of
materials for integrated electronic noses. More importantly, this method points
out the existence of tripartite donor-acceptor charge-transfer complexes
responsible for chemospecific molecular sensing. By showing that molecular

number of radio-frequency (RF) chains and reduced inter-antenna interference
(IAI) at the cost of a lower throughput than its multiplexing-oriented full-RF
based counterparts. Variable-${N_a}$ GSM mitigates this throughput reduction by
incorporating all possible TA activation patterns associated with a variable

maximises the throughput of GSM but suffers a high complexity of the mapping
book design and demodulation. In order to mitigate the complexity, \emph{first

detected, for which the previous 346-s period may be the 2nd harmonic. The
spectra exhibited the ""harder when brighter"" trend in the 1$-$10 keV range, and
a flat continuum without clear cutoff in the 10$-$80 keV range. These
properties are both similar to those observed from several low-luminosity
accreting pulsars, including X Persei in particular. Thus, the compact object
in IGR J00370+6122 is considered to be a magnetized neutron star with a rather
low luminosity. The orbital period was refined to $15.6649 \pm 0.0014$ d. Along
the orbit, the luminosity changes by 3 orders of magnitude, involving a sudden
drop from $\sim 4 \times 10^{33}$ to $\sim 1\times10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at an
orbital phase of 0.3 (and probably vice verse at 0.95). Although these
phenomena cannot be explained by a simple Hoyle-Lyttleton accretion from the
primary's stellar winds, they can be explained when incorporating the propeller
effect with a strong dipole magnetic field of $\sim 5 \times10^{13}$ G.
Therefore, the neutron star in IGR J00370+6122 may have a stronger magnetic
field compared to ordinary X-ray pulsars.

and attracted increasing attention. However, how to develop effective domain
adaptation techniques to improve its cross-domain performance remains
unexplored and unclear. In this paper, we delve into this topic and empirically
find that direct feature distribution alignment on the CNN backbone only brings
limited improvements, as it does not guarantee domain-invariant sequence
features in the transformer for prediction. To address this issue, we propose a
novel Sequence Feature Alignment (SFA) method that is specially designed for
the adaptation of detection transformers. Technically, SFA consists of a domain
query-based feature alignment (DQFA) module and a token-wise feature alignment
(TDA) module. In DQFA, a novel domain query is used to aggregate and align
global context from the token sequence of both domains. DQFA reduces the domain
discrepancy in global feature representations and object relations when
deploying in the transformer encoder and decoder, respectively. Meanwhile, TDA
aligns token features in the sequence from both domains, which reduces the
domain gaps in local and instance-level feature representations in the
transformer encoder and decoder, respectively. Besides, a novel bipartite
matching consistency loss is proposed to enhance the feature discriminability
for robust object detection. Experiments on three challenging benchmarks show
that SFA outperforms state-of-the-art domain adaptive object detection methods.

industries that produce products in masses. These manipulators can be used only
in one configuration, that is either serial or parallel. In this paper, a new
module which has two degrees of freedom is introduced. By connecting the two
and three modules in series, 4 and 6 DoF hybrid manipulators can be formed
respectively. By erecting 3 modules in parallel and with some minor
modifications, a 6 DoF parallel manipulator can be formed. Hence the
manipulator is reconfigurable and can be used as hybrid or parallel manipulator
by disassembling and assembling. The topology design, forward and inverse
position analysis has been done for the two hybrid configurations and the
parallel configuration. This manipulator can be used in industries where
flexible manufacturing system is to be deployed. The three configurations of
the parallel manipulator has been experimentally demonstrated using a graphical

and academia. Satellites and high altitude platform station (HAPS) systems are
expected to be the key enablers of next-generation wireless networks. In this
paper, we introduce a novel downlink satellite communication (SatCom) model
where free-space optical (FSO) communication is adopted between a satellite and
a HAPS node. A hybrid FSO/radio-frequency (RF) transmission model is used
between the HAPS node and ground station (GS). In the first phase of
transmission, the satellite selects the HAPS node that provides the highest
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In the second phase, the selected HAPS decodes and
forwards the signal to the GS. To evaluate the performance of the proposed
system, outage probability expressions are derived for exponentiated Weibull
(EW) and shadowed-Rician fading models while considering the atmospheric
turbulence, stratospheric attenuation, and attenuation due to scattering, path
loss, and pointing errors. Additionally, asymptotic analysis is carried out and
diversity gain is provided. Furthermore, the impact of aperture averaging
technique, temperature, and wind speed are investigated. We also provide some
important guidelines that can be helpful for the design of practical HAPS-aided
SatCom. Finally, the results show that the use of HAPS improves the system
performance and that the proposed model performs better than all other existing
models.

$v_0$, with intermittent directional reversals in the presence of a harmonic
trap of strength $\mu$. The presence of the trap ensures that the position of
the particle eventually reaches a steady state where it is bounded within a
circular region of radius $v_0/\mu$, centered at the minimum of the trap. Due
to the interplay between the rotational diffusion constant $D_R$, reversal rate
$\gamma$, and the trap strength $\mu$, the steady state distribution shows four
different types of shapes, which we refer to as active-I & II, and passive-I &
II phases. In the active-I phase, the weight of the distribution is
concentrated along an annular region close to the circular boundary, whereas in
active-II, an additional central diverging peak appears giving rise to a
Mexican hat-like shape of the distribution. The passive-I is marked by a single
Boltzmann-like centrally peaked distribution in the large $D_R$ limit. On the
other hand, while the passive-II phase also shows a single central peak, it is
distinguished from passive-I by a non-Boltzmann like divergence near the
origin. We characterize these phases by calculating the exact analytical forms
of the distributions in various limiting cases. In particular, we show that for
$D_R\ll\gamma$, the shape transition of the two-dimensional position
distribution from active-II to passive-II occurs at $\mu=\gamma$. We compliment
these analytical results with numerical simulations beyond the limiting cases

good, reliable data in machine learning. The most methods of outlier detection
leverage an auxiliary reconstruction task by assuming that outliers are more
difficult to be recovered than normal samples (inliers). However, it is not
always true, especially for auto-encoder (AE) based models. They may recover
certain outliers even outliers are not in the training data, because they do
not constrain the feature learning. Instead, we think outlier detection can be
done in the feature space by measuring the feature distance between outliers
and inliers. We then propose a framework, MCOD, using a memory module and a
contrastive learning module. The memory module constrains the consistency of
features, which represent the normal data. The contrastive learning module
learns more discriminating features, which boosts the distinction between
outliers and inliers. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show
that our proposed MCOD achieves a considerable performance and outperforms nine
state-of-the-art methods.

as the average of the linear entropy of entanglement of the states produced
after applying a quantum gate over the whole set of separable states. Here we
focus on symmetric two-qubit quantum gates, acting on the symmetric two-qubit
space, and calculate the entangling power in terms of the appropriate
local-invariant. A geometric description of the local equivalence classes of
gates is given in terms of the $\mathfrak{su}(3)$ Lie algebra root vectors.
These vectors define a primitive cell with hexagonal symmetry on a plane, and
through the Weyl group the minimum area on the plane containing the whole set
of locally equivalent quantum gates is identified. We give conditions to
determine when a given quantum gate produces maximally entangled states from
separable ones (perfect entanglers). We found that these gates correspond to
one fourth of the whole set of locally-distinct quantum gates. The theory
developed here is applicable to three-level systems in general, where the
non-locality of a quantum gate is related to its capacity to perform non-rigid
transformations on the Majorana constellation of a state. The results are
illustrated by an anisotropic Heisenberg model, the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model,

of classes, and need pre-collected datasets in advance. However, new classes
often emerge in real-world applications and should be learned incrementally.
For example, in electronic commerce, new types of products appear daily, and in
a social media community, new topics emerge frequently. Under such
circumstances, incremental models should learn several new classes at a time
without forgetting. We find a strong correlation between old and new classes in
incremental learning, which can be applied to relate and facilitate different
learning stages mutually. As a result, we propose CO-transport for class
Incremental Learning (COIL), which learns to relate across incremental tasks
with the class-wise semantic relationship. In detail, co-transport has two
aspects: prospective transport tries to augment the old classifier with optimal
transported knowledge as fast model adaptation. Retrospective transport aims to
transport new class classifiers backward as old ones to overcome forgetting.
With these transports, COIL efficiently adapts to new tasks, and stably resists
forgetting. Experiments on benchmark and real-world multimedia datasets
validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

operation on point cloud remains indefinite due to its irregular data

learns to voxelize the features of local points by exploiting both continuous
and discrete convolutions. Our continuous convolution uniquely employs a 3D
cubic form of kernel weight representation that splits a feature into voxels in
embedding space. By consecutively applying discrete 3D convolutions on the
voxelized features in a spatial manner, preceding continuous convolution is
forced to learn spatial feature mapping, i.e., feature voxelization. In this
way, geometric information can be detailed by encoding with subdivided
features, and our 3D convolutions on these fixed structured data do not suffer
from discretization artifacts thanks to voxelization in embedding space.
Furthermore, we propose a spatial attention module, Local Set Attention (LSA),
to provide comprehensive structure awareness within the local point set and
hence produce representative features. By learning feature voxelization with
LSA, CKConv can extract enriched features for effective point cloud analysis.
We show that CKConv has great applicability to point cloud processing tasks

segmentation with state-of-the-art results.

the mechanism by which chondrules -- sub-millimetric spheroids that dominate

the average circle-equivalent diameters of chondrules define a positive trend
with the petrographic grade, which reflects the progressive role of thermal
metamorphism within the CO parent body. We show that this relationship could
not have been established by thermal metamorphism alone but rather by
aerodynamic sorting during accretion. By modeling the self-gravitational
contraction of clumps of chondrules, we show that (i) the accretion of the CO
parent body(ies) would have generated a gradual change of chondrule size with
depth in the parent body, with larger chondrules being more centrally
concentrated than smaller ones, and (ii) any subsequent growth by pebble
accretion would have been insignificant. These findings give substantial
support to the view that planetesimals formed via gravitational collapse.

examining two internal software startups in companies aligned with the
principles of EDI and with a strong focus on innovation. The preliminary

that internal software startups may be strengthened when the parent companies

the large-scale structure of the Universe within a small redshift range.
  The equation tells that $\xi(r)$ depends on the point mass $m$ and the Jeans
wavelength scale $\lambda_{0}$, which are different for galaxies and clusters.
It explains several longstanding, prominent features of the observed clustering
: that the profile of $\xi_{cc}(r)$ of clusters is similar to $\xi_{gg}(r)$ of
galaxies but with a higher amplitude and a longer correlation length, and that
the correlation length increases with the mean separation between clusters as a
universal scaling $r_0\simeq 0.4d$. Our solution $\xi(r)$ also yields the
observed power-law correlation function of galaxies $\xi_{gg}(r)\simeq
(r_0/r)^{1.7}$ valid only in a range $1<r<10 h^{-1}$Mpc. At larger scales the
solution $\xi(r)$ breaks below the power law and goes to zero around $\sim

access (NOMA) has been widely studied. In conventional power-domain NOMA,
multiple users are multiplexed in the same time and frequency band by different
preset power levels, which, however, may limit the spectral efficiency under
practical finite alphabet inputs. Inspired by the concept of spatial
modulation, we propose to solve this problem by encoding extra information bits
into the power levels, and exploit different signal constellations to help the
receiver distinguish between them. To convey this idea, termed power selection
(PS)-NOMA, clearly, we consider a simple downlink two-user NOMA system with
finite input constellations. Assuming maximum-likelihood detection, we derive
closed-form approximate bit error ratio (BER) expressions for both users. The
achievable rates of both users are also derived in closed form. Simulation
results verify the analysis and show that the proposed PS-NOMA outperforms

chain in force spectroscopy experiments. A Worm-like Chain model is used to
describe force extension experiments with an intrinsic chain parameter called
persistence length, which is a measure of local bending flexibility. For
flexible polymers, there is a discrepancy in estimates of persistence length in
various force regimes. For instance, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) based
pulling experiments report anomaly low values which are also inconsistent with
magnetic tweezers experiments. To understand this, we investigate the role of
coupling between microscopic force probe and intrinsic elasticity of
polyethylene glycol chain in AFM-based experiments. We perform experiments
using oscillatory rheology by providing an external excitation of fixed
frequency to the probe. We show that a proper quantification of elastic
response measured directly by oscillatory technique deviates significantly from
conventional force-extension curves. The persistence length obtained by fitting
WLC to stiffness extension data matches well with equilibrium tweezers
experiments. In addition, for polystyrene chain in poor solvent no deviation in
elastic response is observed between oscillatory and constant velocity pulling
experiments. However, such deviation is seen for polystyrene in good solvent.
We attribute this to hydrophobic interaction between monomers of polystyrene in
water. Our results suggest that oscillatory rheology on single polymer chains
provide quantitative estimate of its elastic response. The consistency in
values of persistence length using magnetic tweezers experiments in low force
regime and the AFM experiments in high force regime suggests that WLC is
successful in describing the polymer elasticity in the force range typically
probed in AFM experiments.

a generalized synaptic score (GSS). In this work we do not concentrate on a
single pruning criterion, but provide a framework for combining arbitrary GSSs
to create more powerful pruning strategies. These COmbined Pruning Scores

combinatorial optimization problem given by COPS is relaxed on a linear program
(LP). This LP is solved analytically and determines a solution for COPS.
Furthermore, an algorithm to compute it for two scores numerically is proposed

exploit both game theory and graph theory to study QoS-aware user grouping
strategies, aiming at minimizing power consumption in downlink multi-cell NOMA
systems. Under different QoS requirements, we derive the optimal successive
interference cancellation (SIC) decoding order with inter-cell interference,
which is different from existing SIC decoding order of increasing channel
gains, and obtain the corresponding power allocation strategy. Based on this,
the exact potential game model of the user grouping strategies adopted by
multiple cells is formulated. We prove that, in this game, the problem for each
player to find a grouping strategy can be converted into the problem of
searching for specific negative loops in the graph composed of users.
Bellman-Ford algorithm is expanded to find these negative loops. Furthermore,
we design a greedy based suboptimal strategy to approach the optimal solution
with polynomial time. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of
grouping users with consideration of QoS and inter-cell interference, and show
that the proposed strategies can considerably reduce total power consumption
comparing with reference strategies.

However, high memory consumption of GAN-based SR (usually generators) causes
performance degradation and more energy consumption, hindering the deployment

propose a novel compression framework \textbf{M}ulti-scale \textbf{F}eature
\textbf{A}ggregation Net based \textbf{GAN} (MFAGAN) for reducing the memory
access cost of the generator. First, to overcome the memory explosion of dense
connections, we utilize a memory-efficient multi-scale feature aggregation net
as the generator. Second, for faster and more stable training, our method
introduces the PatchGAN discriminator. Third, to balance the student
discriminator and the compressed generator, we distill both the generator and
the discriminator. Finally, we perform a hardware-aware neural architecture

Benefiting from these improvements, the proposed MFAGAN achieves up to
\textbf{8.3}$\times$ memory saving and \textbf{42.9}$\times$ computation

steadily improves as we increase model size, contradicting the classical view
on overfitting and generalization. Recently, the double descent phenomena has
been proposed to reconcile this observation with theory, suggesting that the
test error has a second descent when the model becomes sufficiently
overparameterized, as the model size itself acts as an implicit regularizer. In
this paper we add to the growing body of work in this space, providing a
careful study of learning dynamics as a function of model size for the least
squares scenario. We show an excess risk bound for the gradient descent
solution of the least squares objective. The bound depends on the smallest
non-zero eigenvalue of the covariance matrix of the input features, via a
functional form that has the double descent behavior. This gives a new
perspective on the double descent curves reported in the literature. Our
analysis of the excess risk allows to decouple the effect of optimization and
generalization error. In particular, we find that in case of noiseless
regression, double descent is explained solely by optimization-related
quantities, which was missed in studies focusing on the Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse solution. We believe that our derivation provides an alternative
view compared to existing work, shedding some light on a possible cause of this
phenomena, at least in the considered least squares setting. We empirically
explore if our predictions hold for neural networks, in particular whether the
covariance of intermediary hidden activations has a similar behavior as the one
predicted by our derivations.

spurious connected components, holes and voids. Such results are implausible,
violating anticipated anatomical topology. In response, (single-class)
persistent homology-based loss functions have been proposed to capture global

multi-class segmentation. Building an enriched topological description of all
class labels and class label pairs, our loss functions make predictable and

use stars' pixel positions to derive the relative positions between chips. We
refer to the practice as differential astrometry in this paper. In order to
ensure the results are reliable, we took advantage of Gaia EDR3 to derive the
relative positions between chips, to provide a close comparison. We refer to
the practice as photographic astrometry. We implemented the technique for the
CCD mosaic chips of the Bok 2.3-m telescope based on two epochs of observations
(Jan 17,2016 and Mar 5,2017). There is a good agreement between the two types
of astrometry for the relative positions between chips. For the two epochs of
observations, the averages of the gaps derived from photographic astrometry and
differential astrometry differ to about 0.046 pixels (~0.021 arcsec) and 0.001
pixels (~0.001 arcsec), respectively, while the average precisions of the gaps
are about 0.018 pixel (~0.008 arcsec) and 0.028 pixels (<0.013 arcsec),

a third dye laser. While this approach is much more sensitive than a previous 1

intense 289 nm radiation does not saturate the 1' step. In order to test the

coherent drive, and use the waveguide to measure thermodynamic work and heat,

photochemical reactions at the level of ab initio electronic structure is the
state-averaged multi-configurational self-consistent field (SA-MCSCF) method.
However, the exponential computational cost of classical computers with the
increasing number of molecular orbitals hinders applications of SA-MCSCF for
large systems we are interested in. Utilizing quantum computers was recently
proposed as a promising approach to overcome such computational cost, dubbed as
state-averaged orbital-optimized variational quantum eigensolver (SA-OO-VQE).
Here we extend a theory of SA-OO-VQE so that analytical gradients of energy can
be evaluated by standard techniques that are feasible with near-term quantum
computers. The analytical gradients, known only for the state-specific OO-VQE
in previous studies, allow us to determine various characteristics of
photochemical reactions such as the conical intersection (CI) points. We
perform a proof-of-principle calculation of our methods by applying it to the
photochemical cis-trans isomerization of 1,3,3,3-tetrafluoropropene. Numerical
simulations of quantum circuits and measurements can correctly capture the
photochemical reaction pathway of this model system, including the CI points.

have seen remarkable achievements. However, they often need the use of large
amounts of labelled information. By using unsupervised conditional generation
in conjunction with a clustering inference network, ClusterGAN has recently
been able to achieve impressive clustering results. Since the real conditional
distribution of data is ignored, the clustering inference network can only
achieve inferior clustering performance by considering only uniform prior based
generative samples. However, the true distribution is not necessarily balanced.
Consequently, ClusterGAN fails to produce all modes, which results in
sub-optimal clustering inference network performance. So, it is important to
learn the prior, which tries to match the real distribution in an unsupervised
way. In this paper, we propose self-augmentation information maximization
improved ClusterGAN (SIMI-ClusterGAN) to learn the distinctive priors from the
data directly. The proposed SIMI-ClusterGAN consists of four deep neural
networks: self-augmentation prior network, generator, discriminator and

seven benchmark data sets and has shown improved performance over state-of-the

instrumental musical interfaces where sound is generated using digital granular
synthesis, and where interaction and control involve the (fine) operation of
stiff, flat contact surfaces. First, within a historical context, a general
absence of, and clear need for, tangible output that is dynamically
instantiated by the grain-generating process itself is identified. Second, to
fill this gap, a concrete general approach is proposed based on the careful
construction of non-vibratory and vibratory force pulses, in a one-to-one
relationship with sonic grains. An informal pilot psychophysics experiment
initiating the approach was conducted, which took into account the two main
cases for applying forces to the human skin: perpendicular, and lateral.
Initial results indicate that the force pulse approach can enable perceivably
multidimensional, tangible display of the ongoing grain-generating process.
Moreover, it was found that this can be made to meaningfully happen (in real
time) in the same timescale of basic sonic grain generation. This is not a
trivial property, and provides an important and positive fundament for further
developing this type of enhanced display. It also leads to the exciting
prospect of making arbitrary sonic grains actual physical manipulanda.

haptics and control. The overall user experience offered by the technology can
be described as that of tangibly and audibly interacting with a small hologram.
More specifically, Ghostfinger implements automatic visualization of the
dynamic instantiation/parametrization of algorithmic primitives that together
determine the current haptic conditions for fingertip action. Some aspects of
this visualization are visuospatial: A floating see-through cursor provides
real-time, to-scale display of the fingerpad transducer, as it is being moved
by the user. Simultaneously, each haptic primitive instance is represented by a
floating block shape, type-colored, variably transparent, and possibly
overlapping with other such block shapes. Further aspects of visualization are
symbolic: Each instance is also represented by a type symbol, lighting up
within a grid if the instance is providing output to the user. We discuss the
system's user interface, programming interface, and potential applications.
This is done from a general perspective that articulates and emphasizes the
uniquely enabling role of the principle of computation in the implementation of
new forms of instrumental control of musical sound. Beyond the currently
presented technology, this also reflects more broadly on the role of Digital
Musical Instruments (DMIs) in NIME.

The other is long GRBs with gravitational-wave (GW) dominated plateau phases.
These GRBs can be well standardized using the correlation between the plateau

systematic uncertainties in the nonflat $\Lambda$CDM model. Adding type Ia

different types of convolutional neural networks, combined with either
recurrent neural networks or a majority voting strategy, whereas computer
vision methods are suitable to determine the capacity of the container using

estimating the filling mass with audio-visual multi-stage approaches reach up

removing vertices without outgoing edges. One application is to speed up the
parallel decomposition of graphs into strongly connected components (SCC
decomposition), which is a fundamental step for analyzing graphs. We observe
that graph trimming is essentially a kind of arc-consistency problem, and AC-3,
AC-4, and AC-6 are the most relevant arc-consistency algorithms for application
to graph trimming. The existing parallel graph trimming methods require
worst-case $\mathcal O(nm)$ time and worst-case $\mathcal O(n)$ space for
graphs with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. We call these parallel AC-3-based as
they are much like the AC-3 algorithm. In this work, we propose AC-4-based and
AC-6-based trimming methods. That is, AC-4-based trimming has an improved
worst-case time of $\mathcal O(n+m)$ but requires worst-case space of $\mathcal
O(n+m)$; compared with AC-4-based trimming, AC-6-based has the same worst-case
time of $\mathcal O(n+m)$ but an improved worst-case space of $\mathcal O(n)$.
We parallelize the AC-4-based and AC-6-based algorithms to be suitable for
shared-memory multi-core machines. The algorithms are designed to minimize
synchronization overhead. For these algorithms, we also prove the correctness
and analyze time complexities with the work-depth model. In experiments, we
compare these three parallel trimming algorithms over a variety of real and
synthetic graphs. Specifically, for the maximum number of traversed edges per
worker by using 16 workers, AC-3-based traverses up to 58.3 and 36.5 times more
edges than AC-6-based trimming and AC-4-based trimming, respectively.

meet-in-the-middle (QMITM) attack on $r$-round ($r \ge 7$) Feistel construction
to reduce the time complexity. Similar to Hosoyamada et al.'s work, our attack
on 7-round Feistel is also based on Guo et al.'s classical meet-in-the-middle
(MITM) attack [13]. The classic MITM attack consumes a lot of time mainly in
three aspects: construct the lookup table, query data and find a match.
Therefore, parallel Grover search processors are used to reduce the time of
constructing the lookup table. And we adjust the truncated differentials of the
5-round distinguisher proposed by Guo et al. to balance the complexities
between constructing the lookup table and querying data. Finally, we introduce
a quantum claw finding algorithm to find a match for reducing time. The subkeys
can be recovered by this match. Furthermore, for $r$-round ($r > 7$) Feistel
construction, we treat the above attack on the first 7 rounds as an inner loop
and use Grover's algorithm to search the last $r-7$ rounds of subkeys as an
outer loop. In summary, the total time complexity of our attack on $r$-round
($r \ge 7$) is only $O(2^{2n/3+(r-7)n/4})$ less than classical and quantum
attacks. Moreover, our attack belongs to Q1 model and is more practical than
other quantum attacks.

order. It is structurally characterized by a combination of quantitative
low-energy electron diffraction (LEED-IV), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM),
and density functional theory (DFT). We find that Te induces the formation of
four atom wide linear troughs within the Cu(111) surface filled up by two Te
atoms per unit cell. Additionally, the interspace between the troughs is
decorated by Cu$_2$Te$_2$ ad-chains sitting at hcp sites. All Te atoms exhibit
the same local sixfold coordination: They occupy threefold hollow sites of the
substrate and are one-sided attached to another three Cu atoms. The presented
structural model is verified by a LEED-IV analysis with Pendry R-factor of R =

It also has by far the lowest energy of all models tested by DFT and simulated
STM images agree perfectly with experiment. It turns out that the new $\left(5

N\'eel ordering at TN1= 63 K and another magnetic transition at TN2= 25K at
which ferroelectricity sets in, however, without any change in the magnetic
symmetry, but with only a sharp change in the canting angle of Tb 4f and Ni 3d
magnetic moments. There is a subtle difference in the antiferromagnetic state
above and below TN2, which is supported by the fact that there is a
metamagnetic transition below TN2only (for 5 K, at about 60 kOe). We report
here that, with the application of external pressure, there is an upward shift
of TN1, while TN2 shifts towards lower temperatures. It is interesting that the
two magnetic transitions in the same compound behave differently under pressure
and the opposite behavior at TN2 is attributed to local distortion leading to
ferroelectricity. The results are augmented by temperature dependent x-ray
diffraction and positive chemical pressure studies. The chemical pressure
caused by the isoelectronic doping at Ba site by Sr reduces both the transition
temperatures. Clearly, the external pressure favors antiferromagnetic coupling
(that is, leading to TN1 enhancement), whereas the chemical pressure reduces
TN1, suggesting important role of the changes in local hybridization induced by
doping on magnetism in this material.

Bending moments are expressed in terms of elastic curvatures by a convex
combination of local and nonlocal contributions, that is a combination with
non-negative scalar coefficients summing to unity. The nonlocal contribution is
the convolution integral of the elastic curvature field with a suitable
averaging kernel characterized by a scale parameter. The relevant structural
problem, well-posed for non-vanishing local phases, is preliminarily formulated
and exact elastic solutions of some simple beam problems are recalled. Limit
behaviours of the obtained elastic solutions, analytically evaluated, studied

stubby beams is investigated by Timoshenko kinematics. Stress-driven two-phase
integral elasticity is adopted to model size effects which soften or stiffen
classical local responses. The corresponding governing equations of nonlocal
elasticity are established and discussed, non-classical boundary conditions are
detected and an effective coordinate-free solution procedure is proposed. The
presented mixture approach is elucidated by solving simple curved small-scale
beams of current interest in Nanotechnology. The contributed results could be
useful for design and optimization of modern sensors and actuators.

masses has remained elusive for a long time, since it cannot be simulated
directly on the lattice and is strongly cutoff-dependent. We report on a
comprehensive ongoing study using unimproved staggered fermions with
$N_\text{f}\in[2,8]$ mass-degenerate flavours on $N_\tau\in\{4,6,8\}$ lattices,
in which we locate the chiral critical surface separating regions with
first-order transitions from crossover regions in the bare parameter space of
the lattice theory. Employing the fact that it terminates in a tricritical
line, this surface can be extrapolated to the chiral limit using tricritical
scaling with known exponents. Knowing the order of the transitions in the
lattice parameter space, conclusions for approaching the continuum chiral limit
in the proper order can be drawn. While a narrow first-order region cannot be
ruled out, we find initial evidence consistent with a second-order chiral
transition in all massless theories with $N_\text{f}\leq 6$, and possibly up to
the onset of the conformal window at $9\lesssim N_\text{f}^*\lesssim 12$. A
reanalysis of already published $\mathcal{O}(a)$-improved $N_\text{f}=3$ Wilson

demands of subsequent high-level crowd analysis tasks than simply counting.
However, existing localization based methods relying on intermediate
representations (\textit{i.e.}, density maps or pseudo boxes) serving as
learning targets are counter-intuitive and error-prone. In this paper, we
propose a purely point-based framework for joint crowd counting and individual
localization. For this framework, instead of merely reporting the absolute
counting error at image level, we propose a new metric, called density
Normalized Average Precision (nAP), to provide more comprehensive and more
precise performance evaluation. Moreover, we design an intuitive solution under
this framework, which is called Point to Point Network (P2PNet). P2PNet
discards superfluous steps and directly predicts a set of point proposals to
represent heads in an image, being consistent with the human annotation
results. By thorough analysis, we reveal the key step towards implementing such
a novel idea is to assign optimal learning targets for these proposals.
Therefore, we propose to conduct this crucial association in an one-to-one
matching manner using the Hungarian algorithm. The P2PNet not only
significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods on popular counting
benchmarks, but also achieves promising localization accuracy. The codes will

to charm quark mass. By the assumption that $X(2370)$ is predominantly a

The optimisation of its parameters is studied using Monte Carlo simulations of

back-projection (FBP), resulted in spatial resolution, 1.5 $\times$ higher in
the axial direction than for the conventional 3D FBP. For realistic $10$-minute
scans of NEMA IEC and XCAT, which require a trade-off between the noise and
spatial resolution, the need for Gaussian TOF kernel components, coupled with
median post-filtering, is demonstrated. The best sets of 3D filter parameters
were obtained by the Nelder-Mead minimisation of the mean squared error between
the resulting and reference images. The approach allows training the
reconstruction algorithm for custom scans, using the IEC phantom, when the

discriminative-generative representation learning method has performance close
to discriminative methods and has a great advantage in speed. Our method used

The cornerstone of thin-film flow modelling is the Reynolds equation -- a

derivation of the Reynolds equation is based on assumptions and fixed form
constitutive relations, that may not generally be valid, especially when
studying systems under extreme conditions. Furthermore, these explicit
assumptions about the constitutive behaviour of the fluid prohibit applications
in a multiscale scenario based on measured or atomistically simulated data.
Here, we present a method that considers the full compressible Navier-Stokes

perform numerical tests by using a reformulation of the viscous stress tensor
for laminar flow to validate the presented method comparing to results from
conventional Reynolds solutions. The versatility of the method is shown by
incorporating models for mass-conserving cavitation, wall slip and

transcribes a sign language video into an ordered gloss sequence. It is
important to capture the fine-grained gloss-level details, since there is no
explicit alignment between sign video frames and the corresponding glosses.
Among the past works, one promising way is to adopt a one-dimensional
convolutional network (1D-CNN) to temporally fuse the sequential frames.
However, CNNs are agnostic to similarity or dissimilarity, and thus are unable
to capture local consistent semantics within temporally neighboring frames. To
address the issue, we propose to adaptively fuse local features via temporal
similarity for this task. Specifically, we devise a Multi-scale Local-Temporal
Similarity Fusion Network (mLTSF-Net) as follows: 1) In terms of a specific
video frame, we firstly select its similar neighbours with multi-scale
receptive regions to accommodate different lengths of glosses. 2) To ensure
temporal consistency, we then use position-aware convolution to temporally
convolve each scale of selected frames. 3) To obtain a local-temporally
enhanced frame-wise representation, we finally fuse the results of different
scales using a content-dependent aggregator. We train our model in an
end-to-end fashion, and the experimental results on RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014

rate, such as in N-body simulations, the presence of the gaseous envelope is
either neglected, or treated in an over-simplified manner. In this paper, we
present an approximation for the capture radius that does not require the

the capture radius works extremely well for various planetesimal sizes and

deployment of RISs in wireless networks need physically consistent frameworks
that account for the electromagnetic characteristics of dynamic metasurfaces.
In this paper, we introduce a general macroscopic model for evaluating the
scattering from an RIS. The proposed method decomposes the wave reradiated from
an RIS into multiple scattering contributions and is aimed at being embedded
into ray-based models. Since state-of-the-art ray-based models can already
efficiently simulate specular wave reflection, diffraction, and diffuse
scattering, but not anomalous reradiation, we enhance them with an approach
based on Huygens' principle and propose two possible implementations for it.
Multiple reradiation modes can be modeled through the proposed approach, using
the power conservation principle. We validate the accuracy of the proposed
model by benchmarking it against several case studies available in the
literature, which are based on analytical models, full-wave simulations, and
measurements.

developed mapping onto an effective correlated cluster problem makes the
problem accessible to the numerical renormalization group. The evolution of the
spectrum as function of cluster size and cluster site is studied. We applied
the extended Lieb-Mattis theorem to predict whether the spectral function must
vanish at the Fermi energy developing a true pseudo-gap or whether the spectral
function remains finite at $\w=0$. Our numerical renormalization group spectra
confirm the predictions of the theorem and shows a metallic behavior at the
surface of a cluster prevailing in arbitrary spatial dimensions. We present a
conventional minimal extension of a particle-hole symmetric Anderson lattice
model at $U=0$ that leads to a gapped bulk band but a surface band with mainly
$f$-orbital character for weak and moderate hybridization strength. The change
in the site-dependent spectra upon introducing a Kondo hole in the center of
the cluster are presented as a function of the hole-orbital energy. In
particular the spectral signatures across the Kosterlitz-Thouless type quantum
phase transition from a singlet to a local moment fixed point are discussed.

traditional electric grid, which has been functioning for more than a hundred
years. The most crucial difference between traditional grids and smart grids is
the communication infrastructure applied to the latter. However, coupling
between these networks can increase the risk of significant failures. Hence,
assessing the performance of the smart grid communication networks is of great
importance and thus is considered here. As transmission time and cost play
essential roles in many real-world communication networks, both time and budget
constraints are considered in this work. To evaluate the performance of
communication networks, we assume that the data is transmitted from a source to
a destination through a single path. We propose an algorithm that computes the
exact probability of transmitting d units of data from the source to the
destination within T units of time and the budget of b. The algorithm is
illustrated through a benchmark network example. The complexity results are
also provided. A rather large-size benchmark, that is, Pan European topology,
along with one thousand randomly generated test problems are used to generate
the experimental results which show clearly the superiority of our proposed
algorithms to some existing algorithm in the literature.

lattices (Delaunay triangulations) under attacks based on betweenness
centrality. Together with the standard definition of this centrality measure,
we employ a range-limited approximation known as $\ell$-betweenness, where
paths having more than $\ell$ steps are ignored. For finite $\ell$, the attacks
produce continuous percolation transitions that belong to the universality
class of random percolation. On the other hand, the attack under the full range
betweenness induces a discontinuous transition that, in the thermodynamic
limit, occurs after removing a sub-extensive amount of nodes. This behavior is
recovered for $\ell$-betweenness if the cutoff is allowed to scale with the
linear length of the network faster than $\ell\sim L^{0.91}$. Our results
suggest that betweenness centrality encodes information on network robustness
at all scales, and thus cannot be approximated using finite-ranged calculations
without losing attack efficiency.

II that affected almost all the countries of our planet. To control the
COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, it is necessary to understand how the virus is
transmitted to a susceptible individual and eventually spread in the community.
The primary transmission pathway of COVID-19 is human-to-human transmission
through infectious droplets. However, a recent study by Greenhalgh et al.
(Lancet: 397:1603-1605, 2021) demonstrates 10 scientific reasons behind the
airborne transmission of SARS-COV-2. In the present study, we introduce a novel
mathematical model of COVID-19 that considers the transmission of free viruses
in the air besides the transmission of direct contact with an infected person.
The basic reproduction number of the epidemic model is calculated using the
next-generation operator method and observed that it depends on both the
transmission rate of direct contact and free virus contact. The local and
global stability of disease-free equilibrium (DFE) is well established.
Analytically it is found that there is a forward bifurcation between the DFE
and an endemic equilibrium using central manifold theory. Next, we used the
nonlinear least-squares technique to identify the best-fitted parameter values
in the model from the observed COVID-19 mortality data of two major districts
of India. Using estimated parameters for Bangalore urban and Chennai, different
control scenarios for mitigation of the disease are investigated. Results
indicate that when a vaccine crisis is there, the public health authorities
should prefer to vaccinate the susceptible people compared to the recovered
persons who are now healthy. Along with face mask use, treatment of
hospitalized patients and vaccination of susceptibles, immigration should be
allowed in a supervised manner so that economy of the overall society remains
healthy.

and function. A quantitative diagnosis technique consists of localizing the CT
slice passing through the middle of the third lumbar area (L3) and segmenting
muscles at this level. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning
method for accurate localization of the L3 CT slice. Our method trains a
reinforcement learning agent by incentivizing it to discover the right
position. Specifically, a Deep Q-Network is trained to find the best policy to
follow for this problem. Visualizing the training process shows that the agent
mimics the scrolling of an experienced radiologist. Extensive experiments
against other state-of-the-art deep learning based methods for L3 localization
prove the superiority of our technique which performs well even with a limited

neural networks based on reachability analysis of neural networks. To
characterize noises of input data, the input training data is disturbed in the
description of interval sets. Interval-based reachability analysis is then
performed for the hidden layer. With the reachability analysis results, a
robust optimization training method is developed in the framework of robust
least-square problems. Then, the developed robust least-square problem is
relaxed to a semidefinite programming problem. It has been shown that the
developed robust learning method can provide better robustness against
perturbations at the price of loss of training accuracy to some extent. At
last, the proposed method is evaluated on a robot arm model learning example.

spontaneously broken global $U(1)$ symmetry in a supersymmetric theory is
considered. This fermion obtains mass from the supergravity effects leading to
a RH neutrino at the electroweak scale with a mass similar to the gravitino
mass. A prototype model realizing this scenario contains just three gauge
singlet superfields needed for the type I seesaw mechanism. Masses of the other
two neutrinos are determined by the $U(1)$ breaking scale which too can be
around the electroweak scale. Light neutrinos obtain their masses in this
scenario through (a) mixing with the RH neutrinos (type I seesaw), (b) mixing
with neutralinos ($R$-parity breaking), (c) indirectly through mixing of the RH
neutrinos with neutralinos, and (d) radiative corrections. All these
contributions are described by the same set of a small number of underlying
parameters and provide a very constrained and predictive framework for the
neutrino masses which is investigated in detail for various choices of $U(1)$
symmetries. It is found that flavour independent $U(1)$ symmetries cannot
describe neutrino masses if the soft supersymmetry breaking terms are flavour
universal and one needs to consider flavour dependent symmetries. Considering a
particular example of $L_\mu - L_\tau$ symmetry, it is shown that viable
neutrino masses and mixing can be obtained without introducing any flavour
violation in the soft sector. The leptonic couplings of Majoron are worked out
in the model and shown to be consistent with various laboratory, astrophysical
and cosmological constraints. The neutrino data allows sizeable couplings
between the RH neutrinos and Higgsinos which can be used to probe the
pseudo-Goldstone fermion at colliders through its displaced decay vertex.

imprinted on the primordial gravitational waves (pGWs) produced during the

If the future GW surveys observe a suppression feature in the pGW spectrum for

individual task, that exhibit much wider generalisation of behaviour to a
massive, rich space of challenges. We define a universe of tasks within an
environment domain and demonstrate the ability to train agents that are
generally capable across this vast space and beyond. The environment is
natively multi-agent, spanning the continuum of competitive, cooperative, and
independent games, which are situated within procedurally generated physical 3D
worlds. The resulting space is exceptionally diverse in terms of the challenges
posed to agents, and as such, even measuring the learning progress of an agent
is an open research problem. We propose an iterative notion of improvement
between successive generations of agents, rather than seeking to maximise a
singular objective, allowing us to quantify progress despite tasks being
incomparable in terms of achievable rewards. We show that through constructing
an open-ended learning process, which dynamically changes the training task
distributions and training objectives such that the agent never stops learning,
we achieve consistent learning of new behaviours. The resulting agent is able
to score reward in every one of our humanly solvable evaluation levels, with
behaviour generalising to many held-out points in the universe of tasks.
Examples of this zero-shot generalisation include good performance on Hide and
Seek, Capture the Flag, and Tag. Through analysis and hand-authored probe tasks
we characterise the behaviour of our agent, and find interesting emergent
heuristic behaviours such as trial-and-error experimentation, simple tool use,
option switching, and cooperation. Finally, we demonstrate that the general

Calibration Source (ECS). The ECS consists of an Fe-55 radioactive source and
is placed in the ACIS housing such that all chips are fully illuminated. Since
the radioactive source decays over time with a half-life of 2.7 years, count
rates are becoming too low for gain calibration. Instead, astrophysical
calibration sources will be needed, which do not fill and illuminate the entire
field of view. Here, we determine the dominant spatial components of the gain
maps through principal component analysis (PCA). We find that, given the noise
levels observed today, all ACIS gain maps can be sufficiently described by just
a few (often only one) spatial components. We conclude that illuminating a
small area is sufficient for gain calibration. We apply this to observations of
the astrophysical source Cassiopeia A. The resulting calibration is found to be
accurate to 0.6% in at least 68% of the chip area, following the same

pre-trained on large datasets are adaptively and selectively adjusted for
individual test images. To avoid overfitting, GainTuning optimizes a single
multiplicative scaling parameter (the ""Gain"") of each channel in the
convolutional layers of the CNN. We show that GainTuning improves
state-of-the-art CNNs on standard image-denoising benchmarks, boosting their
denoising performance on nearly every image in a held-out test set. These
adaptive improvements are even more substantial for test images differing
systematically from the training data, either in noise level or image type. We
illustrate the potential of adaptive denoising in a scientific application, in
which a CNN is trained on synthetic data, and tested on real
transmission-electron-microscope images. In contrast to the existing
methodology, GainTuning is able to faithfully reconstruct the structure of
catalytic nanoparticles from these data at extremely low signal-to-noise

(ISAC) system for monitoring human activities directly related to healthcare.
Real-time monitoring of humans can assist professionals in providing healthy
living enabling technologies to ensure the health, safety, and well-being of
people of all age groups. To enhance the human activity recognition performance
of the ISAC system, we propose to use synthetic data generated through our
human micro-Doppler simulator, SimHumalator to augment our limited measurement
data. We generate a more realistic micro-Doppler signature dataset using a
style-transfer neural network. The proposed network extracts environmental
effects such as noise, multipath, and occlusions effects directly from the
measurement data and transfers these features to our clean simulated
signatures. This results in more realistic-looking signatures qualitatively and
quantitatively. We use these enhanced signatures to augment our measurement
data and observe an improvement in the classification performance by 5%
compared to no augmentation case. Further, we benchmark the data augmentation
performance of the style transferred signatures with three other synthetic
datasets -- clean simulated spectrograms (no environmental effects), simulated
data with added AWGN noise, and simulated data with GAN generated noise. The
results indicate that style transferred simulated signatures well captures
environmental factors more than any other synthetic dataset.

waveform spectrum, there exists an optimal angle of operation which maximizes
the Fisher Information (FI) of the target bearing estimate. Previous
investigations into this phenomena show that for narrowband (i.e, high $Q$)
Linear Frequency Modulated (LFM) waveforms, the angle of maximum FI is solely
determined by its center frequency $f_c$. Steering the region of maximum
bearing estimation precision is then achieved by appropriate selection of the
LFM waveform's center frequency $f_c$. This fine bearing estimation is
accomplished without steering the projector's main response axis. In addition
to LFM waveforms, a wide variety of other active sonar waveform types exist
that possess distinct spectral characteristics. These other waveforms possess
different Ambiguity Function (AF) shapes from the LFM and are typically
utilized to suite the range-Doppler resolution requirements of the active sonar
system. This paper investigates the transmit waveform impact on off-axis
bearing estimation performance and the spectral filtering impact on the
waveform's AF shape. High $Q$ waveforms perform similarly to the LFM for
off-axis bearing estimation while the transducer's spectral filtering perturbs

models moving and experiencing large deformations while immersed in generalized
Newtonian fluids. The method is oriented towards applications involving
microscopic devices or organisms in the soft-bio-matter realm. By considering
that the strain energy of the solid may explicitly depend on time, we
incorporate a mechanism for active response. The solids are modeled as Cosserat
rods, a detailed formulation being provided for the special case of a planar
non-shearable rod. The discretization adopts one-dimensional Hermite elements
for the rod and low-order Lagrange two-dimensional elements for the fluid's
velocity and pressure. The fluid mesh is boundary-fitted, with remeshing at
each time step. Several time marching schemes are studied, of which a
semi-implicit scheme emerges as most effective. The method is demonstrated in
very challenging examples: the roll-up of a rod to circular shape and later
sudden release, the interaction of a soft rod with a fluid jet and the active
self-locomotion of a sperm-like rod. The article includes a detailed
description of a code that implements the method in the Firedrake library.

No-Scale Flipped $SU(5)$ many years ago, and as a result, the renormalization
group equation (RGE) running was immediately shaped to produce a distinctive
and rather beneficial two-stage gauge coupling unification process to avoid the
Landau pole and lift unification to the string scale, in addition to
contributing through 1-loop to the light Higgs boson mass. The flippons have
long stood ready to tackle another challenge, and now do so yet again, where
the charged vector-like ""lepton""/singlet couples with the muon, the
supersymmetric down-type Higgs $H_d$, and a singlet $S$, using a chirality flip
to easily accommodate the muonic $g-2$ discrepancy in No-Scale

derived model over the prior 11 years that remains accommodative of all
presently available LHC limits plus all other experimental constraints,

this field has been in single image-based mesh estimation, there has been a
recent uptick in efforts to infer mesh dynamics from video given its role in
alleviating issues such as depth ambiguity and occlusions. However, a key
limitation of existing work is the assumption that all the observed motion
dynamics can be modeled using one dynamical/recurrent model. While this may
work well in cases with relatively simplistic dynamics, inference with
in-the-wild videos presents many challenges. In particular, it is typically the
case that different body parts of a person undergo different dynamics in the
video, e.g., legs may move in a way that may be dynamically different from
hands (e.g., a person dancing). To address these issues, we present a new
method for video mesh recovery that divides the human mesh into several local
parts following the standard skeletal model. We then model the dynamics of each
local part with separate recurrent models, with each model conditioned
appropriately based on the known kinematic structure of the human body. This
results in a structure-informed local recurrent learning architecture that can
be trained in an end-to-end fashion with available annotations. We conduct a
variety of experiments on standard video mesh recovery benchmark datasets such
as Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW, demonstrating the efficacy of our design
of modeling local dynamics as well as establishing state-of-the-art results

We provide new insights into the nature of HESS J1857+026, a
very-high-energy {\gamma}-ray source whose complex morphology in the TeV band
was attributed to the superposition of two distinct sources. Methods. We
performed radio continuum observations to look for the pulsar wind nebula and
the supernova remnant associated with the pulsar PSR J1856+0245, which might be
powering part of the {\gamma}-ray emission. We observed HESS J1857+026 with the
Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) at 1.5 GHz in the C configuration. In
addition, using the same array configuration, we observed a region of
$0.4^\circ \times 0.4^\circ$ towards PSR J1856+0245 at 6.0 GHz. We obtained
complementary data for the neutral hydrogen and molecular gas emission from
public surveys in order to investigate the properties of the interstellar
medium in the direction of HESS J1857+026. Results. The new observations at
1.5GHz do not show evidence of emission above the noise level of
$0.7\,\rm{mJy\,beam^{-1}}$ that could be associated with either HESS J1857+026
or PSR J1856+0245. Also, in the new image at 6.0GHz we do not detect radio
emission from a pulsar wind nebula powered by PSR J1856+0245. The neutral gas
analysis shows the existence of a superbubble in the direction of the
{\gamma}-ray source. We suggest that this structure is located at
$\sim5.5\,\rm{kpc}$, compatible with the distance to the pulsar PSR J1856+0245.
Conclusions. We conclude that TeV emission from HESS J1857+026 originates in a
superbubble, arguing in favour of a single {\gamma}-ray source rather than the
superposition of two distinct sources. The pulsar PSR J1856+0245 could also be
contributing as a source of {\gamma}-rays within the bubble.

two graph neural networks (GNN) that both directly treat the network we want to

another to compute a feasible dual solution of the convex relaxation, thereby
providing a valid lower bound.
  We provide a new verification dataset that is more challenging than those
used in the literature, thereby providing an effective alternative for testing
algorithmic improvements for verification. Whilst using just one of the GNNs
leads to a reduction in verification time, we get optimal performance when
combining the two GNN approaches. Our combined framework achieves a 50\%
reduction in both the number of branches and the time required for verification

Debye random media, which are entirely defined by a purely exponentially
decaying two-point correlation function $S_2(r)$. In this work, we consider
three different classes of Debye random media. First, we generate the ""most

Torquato, Phys. Rev. E, 57, 495 (1998)]. A second class of Debye random media
is obtained by demonstrating that the corresponding two-point correlation
functions are effectively realized in the first three space dimensions by
certain models of overlapping, polydisperse spheres. A third class is obtained
by using the Yeong-Torquato algorithm to construct Debye random media that are
constrained to have an unusual prescribed pore-size probability density
function. We structurally discriminate these three classes of Debye random
media from one another by ascertaining their other statistical descriptors,
including the pore-size, surface correlation, chord-length probability density,
and lineal-path functions. We also compare and contrast the percolation
thresholds as well as the diffusion and fluid transport properties of these
degenerate Debye random media. We find that these three classes of Debye random
media are generally distinguished by the aforementioned descriptors and their
microstructures are also visually distinct from one another. Our work further
confirms the well-known fact that scattering information is insufficient to
determine the effective physical properties of two-phase media. Additionally,

  Network","Accepted by ACMMM2021",,,,"cs.CV cs.MM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recent deep networks have convincingly demonstrated high capability in crowd
counting, which is a critical task attracting widespread attention due to its
various industrial applications. Despite such progress, trained data-dependent
models usually can not generalize well to unseen scenarios because of the
inherent domain shift. To facilitate this issue, this paper proposes a novel
adversarial scoring network (ASNet) to gradually bridge the gap across domains
from coarse to fine granularity. In specific, at the coarse-grained stage, we
design a dual-discriminator strategy to adapt source domain to be close to the
targets from the perspectives of both global and local feature space via
adversarial learning. The distributions between two domains can thus be aligned
roughly. At the fine-grained stage, we explore the transferability of source
characteristics by scoring how similar the source samples are to target ones
from multiple levels based on generative probability derived from coarse stage.
Guided by these hierarchical scores, the transferable source features are
properly selected to enhance the knowledge transfer during the adaptation
process. With the coarse-to-fine design, the generalization bottleneck induced
from the domain discrepancy can be effectively alleviated. Three sets of
migration experiments show that the proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art
counting performance compared with major unsupervised methods.

at identifying different latent states of overall toxicity burden (LOTox

generic instability of black hole (BH) quasinormal mode (QNM) overtones under

assessment of the size of perturbations. This is encoded in the scalar product
and its choice is not unique. We address the impact of the scalar product
choice, founding it on the physical energy scales of the problem. The article
is organized in three parts: basics, applications and heuristic proposals. In
the first part, we revisit the energy scalar product used in the hyperboloidal
approach to QNMs, extending previous effective analyses and placing them on
solid spacetime basis. The second part focuses on applications of the scalar
product in the QNM problem: i) we demonstrate that the QNM instability is not
an artifact of previous spectral numerical schemes, by implementing a finite
elements calculation from a weak formulation; ii) using Keldysh's theorem, we
provide QNM resonant expansions for the gravitational waveform, with explicit
expressions of the expansion coefficients; iii) we propose the notion of
""epsilon-dual QNM expansions"" to exploit BH QNM instability in BH spectroscopy,
exploiting both non-perturbed and perturbed QNMs, the former informing on large
scales and the latter probing small scales. The third part enlarges the
conceptual scope of BH QNM instability proposing: a) spiked perturbations are
more efficient in triggering BH QNM instabilities than smooth ones, b) a
general picture of the BH QNM instability problem is given, supporting the
conjecture (built on Burnett's conjecture) that Nollert-Price branches converge
universally to logarithmic Regge branches in the high-frequency limit and c)

biological networks. Neutral competition can be represented by an unbiased
random drift process in which the states of vertices (e.g., opinions,
genotypes, or species) in a network are updated by repeatedly selecting two
connected vertices. One of these vertices copies the state of the selected
neighbor. Such updates are repeated until all vertices are in the same
""consensus"" state. There is no unique rule for selecting the vertex pair to be
updated. Real-world processes comprise three limiting factors that can
influence the selected edge and the direction of spread: (1) the rate at which
a vertex sends a state to its neighbors, (2) the rate at which a state is
received by a neighbor, and (3) the rate at which a state can be exchanged
through a connecting edge. We investigate how these three limitations influence
neutral competition in networks with two communities generated by a stochastic
block model. By using Monte Carlo simulations, we show how the community
structure and update rule determine the states' success probabilities and the
time until a consensus is reached. We present a heterogeneous mean-field theory
that agrees well with the Monte Carlo simulations. The effectiveness of the

also addressing the absence of any fast periodicity that might be associated
with the spin of an underlying compact object. Both phenomena can be accounted
for by a young, highly magnetized, precessing neutron star that emits beamed
radiation with significant imposed phase jitter. Sporadic narrow-beam emission
into an overall wide solid angle can account for the necessary phase jitter,
but the slow periodicities with 25 to 55 % duty cycles constrain beam
traversals to be significantly smaller. Instead, phase jitter may result from
variable emission altitudes that yield large retardation and aberration delays.
A detailed arrival-time analysis for triaxial precession includes wobble of the
radio beam and the likely larger, cyclical torque resulting from the changes in
the spin-magnetic moment angle. These effects will confound identification of
the fast periodicity in sparse data sets longer than about a quarter of a
precession cycle unless fitted for and removed as with orbital fitting.
Stochastic spin noise, likely to be much larger than in radio pulsars, may
hinder detection of any fast-periodicity in data spans longer than a few days.
These decoherence effects will dissipate as FRB sources age, so they may evolve

These logarithmic singularities are an obstruction to the smoothness of the
zero-rest-mass field at null infinity and, in particular, to peeling. In the
case of the spin-2 field it has been shown that these logarithmic singularities
can be precluded if the initial data for the field satisfies a certain
regularity condition involving the vanishing, at spatial infinity, of a certain
spinor (the linearised Cotton spinor) and its totally symmetrised derivatives.
In this article we investigate the relation between this regularity condition
and the staticity of the spin-2 field. It is shown that while any static spin-2
field satisfies the regularity condition, not every solution satisfying the

solar wind, and such ion differential flows can provide the free energy to
drive Alfv\'en/ion-cyclotron and fast-magnetosonic/whistler instabilities.
Previous works mainly focused on ion beam instability under the parameters
representative of the solar wind nearby 1 au. In this paper we further study
proton beam instability using the radial models of the magnetic field and
plasma parameters in the inner heliosphere. We explore a comprehensive
distribution of proton beam instability as functions of the heliocentric
distance and the beam speed. We also perform a detailed analysis of the energy
transfer between unstable waves and particles and quantify how much the free
energy of the proton beam flows into unstable waves and other kinds of particle
species (i.e., proton core, alpha particle, and electron). This work clarifies
that both parallel and perpendicular electric fields are responsible for the
excitation of oblique Alfv\'en/ion-cyclotron and oblique
fast-magnetosonic/whistler instabilities. Moreover, this work proposes an
effective growth length to estimate whether the instability is efficiently
excited or not. It shows that oblique Alfv\'en/ion-cyclotron instability,
oblique fast-magnetosonic/whistler instability, and oblique Alfv\'en/ion-beam
instability can be efficiently driven by proton beams drifting at the speed
$\sim$ 600-1300 km s$^{-1}$ in the solar atmosphere. In particular, oblique
Alfv\'en/ion-cyclotron waves driven in the solar atmosphere can be
significantly damped therein, leading to the solar corona heating. These
results are helpful for understanding proton beam dynamics in the inner
heliosphere and can be verified through in situ satellite measurements.

Segmentation of bone, cartilage, and joint fluid is necessary for the OA

performing instance segmentation and suffer from class imbalance problems. This
study deployed Mask R-CNN instance segmentation and improved it (improved-Mask
R-CNN (iMaskRCNN)) to obtain a more accurate generalized segmentation for
OA-associated tissues. Training and validation of the method were performed
using 500 MRI knees from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset and 97 MRI
scans of patients with symptomatic hip OA. Three modifications to Mask R-CNN
yielded the iMaskRCNN: adding a 2nd ROIAligned block, adding an extra decoder
layer to the mask-header, and connecting them by a skip connection. The results
were assessed using Hausdorff distance, dice score, and coefficients of
variation (CoV). The iMaskRCNN led to improved bone and cartilage segmentation
compared to Mask RCNN as indicated with the increase in dice score from 95% to
98% for the femur, 95% to 97% for tibia, 71% to 80% for femoral cartilage, and
81% to 82% for tibial cartilage. For the effusion detection, dice improved with
iMaskRCNN 72% versus MaskRCNN 71%. The CoV values for effusion detection
between Reader1 and Mask R-CNN (0.33), Reader1 and iMaskRCNN (0.34), Reader2

two readers (0.21), indicating a high agreement between the human readers and
both Mask R-CNN and iMaskRCNN. Mask R-CNN and iMaskRCNN can reliably and
simultaneously extract different scale articular tissues involved in OA,
forming the foundation for automated assessment of OA. The iMaskRCNN results
show that the modification improved the network performance around the edges.

cardinality constraint. Crucially, these estimates inherit shrinkage or
regularization and uncertainty quantification from the underlying Bayesian
model, and apply for any well-specified Bayesian LMM. More broadly, our
decision analysis strategy deemphasizes the role of a single ""best"" subset,
which is often unstable and limited in its information content, and instead
favors a collection of near-optimal subsets. This collection is summarized by
key member subsets and variable-specific importance metrics. Customized subset
search and out-of-sample approximation algorithms are provided for more
scalable computing. These tools are applied to simulated data and a
longitudinal physical activity dataset, and demonstrate excellent prediction,

telescope at 1.36 GHz on 9 April 2021 and detected 20 bursts. A downward drift
in frequency over time is clearly seen from the majority of bursts in our
sample. A structure-maximizing dispersion measure (DM) search on the
multi-component bursts in our sample yields a DM of 411.6$\pm$0.6 pc/cm$^3$. We
find that the rotation measure (RM) of the bursts varies around their mean
value of -605 rad/m$^2$ with a standard deviation of 11.1 rad/m$^2$. This RM
magnitude is 10 times larger than the expected Galactic contribution along this
line of sight (LoS). We estimate a LoS magnetic field strength of 4--6 $\mu$G,
assuming that the entire host galaxy DM contributes to the RM. Further
polarization measurements will help determine FRB 20201124A's RM stability. The
bursts are highly linearly polarized, with some showing signs of circular
polarization, the first for a repeating FRB. Their polarization position angles
(PAs) are flat across the burst envelopes and vary between bursts. We argue
that the varying polarization fractions and PAs of FRB 20201124A are similar to
known magnetospheric emission from pulsars, while the observed circular
polarization, combined with the RM variability, is hard to explain with Faraday
conversion. The high linear polarization fractions, flat PAs, and downward
drift from FRB 20201124A bursts are similar to previous repeating sources,
while the observed circular polarization is a newly seen behaviour among
repeaters.

a promising candidate for a unified theory. The experimentally observed masses
of quarks and charged leptons put a restriction on the moduli of the $G_2$
manifold. These moduli in turn uniquely determine the Dirac interactions of the
neutrinos. In the paper, we explicitly compute the Dirac terms for neutrino
mass matrix using the moduli from a localized model with resolved $E_8$
singularities on a $G_2$ manifold. This is a novel approach as the Dirac terms
are not assumed but derived from the structure of quarks' and charged leptons'
masses. Using known mass splittings and mixing angles of neutrinos, we show the
acceptable region for Majorana terms. We also analyse the theoretical region
for Majorana terms induced from the expectation values of right handed
neutrinos through the Kolda-Martin mechanism. The intersection of the two
regions indicates a restriction on neutrino masses. In particular, the lightest
neutrino must have small but non-zero mass. Moreover, this also puts
constraints on possible Majorana contributions from K\""ahler potential and
superpotential, which can be traced down to a restriction on the geometry.We
conclude that the masses of the two heavier light neutrinos are about $0.05
\text{ eV}$ and $0.009 \text{ eV}$ ($0.05 \text{ eV} $ and $0.05 \text{ eV} $))
for normal (inverted) hierarchy. In both hierarchies, we predict the light
neutrinos are mostly Dirac type. Hence neutrino-less double-beta decay will be
small. This is a testable result in a near future. Some bounds on heavy
neutrinos are also derived.

coordinated process of various subcomponents, in reaction to an event, namely
the subjective feeling, the cognitive appraisal, the expression, a

hypothesize that these components are associated with linguistic realizations:
an emotion can be expressed by describing a physiological bodily reaction (""he

that emotions on Twitter are predominantly expressed by event descriptions or

Universe is redshift-dependent. Since cosmological redshifts change with time -
known as the redshift drift - all redshift-dependent quantities acquire a
time-dependence, and a fortiori so do black hole shadows. We find a
mathematical description of the black hole shadow drift and show that the
amplitude of this effect is of order $10^{-16}$ per day for M87$^{\star}$.
While this effect is small, we argue that its non-detection can be used to
constrain the accretion rate around supermassive black holes, as well as a
novel probe of the equivalence principle. If general relativity is assumed, we
infer from the data obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope for M87$^{\star}$ a
maximum accretion rate of $|\dot{M}/{M}| \leq 10^5 M_{\odot}$ per year. On the
other hand, in the case of an effective gravitation coupling, we derive a
constraint of $|\dot{G}/G| \leq 10^{-3}-10^{-4}$ per year. The effect of
redshift drift on the visibility amplitude and frequency of the universal
interferometric signatures of photon rings is also discussed, which we show to
be very similar to the shadow drift. This is of particular interest for future

modern storage hardware with built-in transparent compression. Recent years
have witnessed significant interest in applying log-structured merge tree
(LSM-tree) as an alternative to B-tree. The current consensus is that, compared
with B-tree, LSM-tree has distinct advantages in terms of storage space
efficiency and write amplification. This paper argues that one should revisit
this belief upon the arrival of storage hardware with built-in transparent
compression. Advanced storage appliances~(e.g., all-flash array) and emerging
computational storage drives perform hardware-based lossless data compression,
transparent to OS and user applications. Beyond straightforwardly reducing the
physical storage cost difference between B-tree and LSM-tree, such modern
storage hardware brings new opportunities to innovate B-tree implementation in
order to largely reduce its write amplification. As the first step to explore
the potential, this paper presents three simple design techniques (i.e.,
deterministic page shadowing, localized page modification logging, and sparse
redo logging) that can leverage such modern storage hardware to significantly
reduce the B-tree write amplification. We implemented these design techniques
and carried out experiments on a commercial storage drive with built-in
transparent compression. The results show that the proposed design techniques
can reduce the B-tree write amplification by over 10x. Compared with RocksDB (a
popular key-value store built upon LSM-tree), the implemented B-tree can
achieve similar or even smaller write amplification and physical storage space
usage.

predictions, making the existing XAI approaches unreliable. To our best
knowledge, the OoD data problem in perturbation-based XAI algorithms has not
been adequately addressed in the literature. In this work, we address this OoD
data problem by designing an additional module quantifying the affinity between
the perturbed data and the original dataset distribution, which is integrated
into the process of aggregation. Our solution is shown to be compatible with
the most popular perturbation-based XAI algorithms, such as RISE, OCCLUSION,
and LIME. Experiments have confirmed that our methods demonstrate a significant
improvement in general cases using both computational and cognitive metrics.
Especially in the case of degradation, our proposed approach demonstrates
outstanding performance comparing to baselines. Besides, our solution also
resolves a fundamental problem with the faithfulness indicator, a commonly used

The developed methodology encompasses a road surface model, a non-linear

Ride comfort is determined by applying a commonly used threshold method and an
analysis based on ISO 2631. The two methods are compared against comfort

framework's practical application with real data and achieves high-resolution

purpose of this study was to identify, analyze, synthesize and evaluate
research works that touched on this topic, with this, to have knowledge about
the models of uses of analogies, most used didactic strategies, research
methodologies in this field and how to evaluate the learning effectiveness of
working with analogies. The methodology that was used is the systematic mapping
study; Five questions were posed that guided the information tracking process.
Later, the electronic documents in English for the last twenty years were
traced in five databases related to the educational field. Finally, it is
concluded by responding to the purpose of the study where it is evident that,
broadly speaking, the research methodologies in this field are quantitative as
well as qualitative, to implement analogies, resources such as images,
illustrations, textual indications and audiovisual aids are used, it is usually
evaluated the effectiveness of using analogies with multiple choice tests, oral

coronavirus pandemic pose a substantial threat to the new consumer class of
many emerging economies. In Brazil, considerable improvements in social
inclusion have fostered the emergence of hundreds of thousands of first-time
fliers over the past decades. We apply a two-step regression methodology in
which the first step consists of identifying air transport markets
characterized by greater social inclusion, using indicators of the local
economies' income distribution, credit availability, and access to the
Internet. In the second step, we inspect the drivers of the plunge in air
travel demand since the pandemic began, differentiating markets by their
predicted social inclusion intensity. After controlling for potential
endogeneity stemming from the spread of COVID-19 through air travel, our
results suggest that short and low-density routes are among the most impacted
airline markets and that business-oriented routes are more impacted than
leisure ones. Finally, we estimate that a market with 1 per cent higher social
inclusion is associated with a 0.153 per cent to 0.166 per cent more pronounced
decline in demand during the pandemic. Therefore, markets that have benefited
from greater social inclusion in the country may be the most vulnerable to the
current crisis.

potential in facilitating the stacking of layers of different 2D materials for
optoelectronic devices with superior characteristics at a reduced cost.
However, the fabrication of large area all-2D heterostructures is still
challenging towards realizing practical devices. In the present work, we have
demonstrated a rapid yet simple, impurity free and highly efficient
sonication-assisted chemical exfoliation approach to synthesize hybrid vdWHs
based on 2D molybdenum disulphide (MoS$_2$) and tungsten disulphide (WS$_2$),
with high yield. Microscopic and spectroscopic studies have confirmed the
successful exfoliation of layered 2D materials and formation of their hybrid
heterostructure. The co-existence of 2D MoS2 and WS2 in the vdW hybrid is
established by optical absorption and Raman shift measurements along with their
chemical stiochiometry determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The
spectral response of the vdWH/Si (2D/3D) heterojunction photodetector
fabricated using the as-synthesized material is found to show superior
broadband photoresponse compared to that shown by the individual 2D MoS$_2$ and
WS$_2$ based devices. The peak responsivity is found to be ~2.15 A/W at a
wavelength of ~560 nm for an applied bias of -5 V. The ease of fabrication and
superior performance of the chemically synthesized vdWH-based devices have
revealed their potential use for large area optoelectronic applications on Si
compatible CMOS platforms.

and is the most elegant propellant-less propulsion system for the future
exploration of the Solar System and beyond. By today the study on sail membrane
deployment strategies has attracted considerable attention.
  Goal: In this work we present an idea of the deployment and stretching of the
circular solar sail. We consider the superconducting current loop attached to
the thin membrane %to develop a new (method) approach of deployment of a solar
sail and and predict that a superconducting current loop can deploy and stretch
the circular solar sail membrane.
  Method: In the framework of a strict mathematical approach based on the
classical electrodynamics and theory of elasticity the magnetic field induced
by the superconducting current loop and elastic properties of a circular solar
sail membrane and wire loop are analyzed. The formulas for the wire and sail
membrane stresses and strains caused by the current in the superconducting wire
are derived.
  Results: The obtained analytical expressions can be applied to a wide range
of solar sail sizes. Numerical calculations for the sail of radius of 5 m to
150 m made of CP1 membrane of the thickness of 3.5 $\mu m$ attached to
Bi$-$2212 superconducting wire with the cross-section radius of 0.5 mm to 10 mm
are presented. Calculations are performed for the engineering current densities
of 100 A/mm$^{2}$ to 1000 A/mm$^{2}$.
  Conclusion: Our calculations demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed idea
for the solar sail deployment for the future exploration of the deep space by
means of the light pressure propellant.

encompasses modularity and correlation clustering. Our framework consists of
highly-optimized implementations that scale to large data sets of billions of

framework improves the state-of-the-art trade-offs between speed and quality of
scalable community detection. For example, on a 30-core machine with two-way

other correlation clustering baselines, and up to 28.44x speedups over our own
sequential baselines while maintaining or improving quality.

adaptive integral method, can model both homogeneous and multilayered
background media, and supports excitation via lumped ports or an incident
field. Unlike existing parallel BEM solvers, we use a formulation that
rigorously models the skin effect, which results in two coupled computational
workloads. The external-problem workload models electromagnetic coupling
between conductive objects, while the internal-problem workload describes field
distributions within them. We propose a parallelization strategy that
distributes these two workloads evenly over thousands of processing cores. The
external-problem workload is balanced in the same manner as existing parallel
solvers that employ approximate models for conductive objects. However, we
assert that the internal-problem workload should be balanced by algorithms from
scheduling theory. The parallel scalability of the proposed solver is tested on
three different structures found in both integrated circuits and metasurfaces.
The proposed parallelization strategy runs efficiently on distributed-memory
computers with thousands of CPU cores and outperforms competing strategies
derived from existing methods.

for recommendation based on implicit feedback collaborative filtering. However,
standard CML methods learn fixed user and item representations, which fails to
capture the complex interests of users. Existing extensions of CML also either
ignore the heterogeneity of user-item relations, i.e. that a user can
simultaneously like very different items, or the latent item-item relations,
i.e. that a user's preference for an item depends, not only on its intrinsic
characteristics, but also on items they previously interacted with. In this
paper, we present a hierarchical CML model that jointly captures latent
user-item and item-item relations from implicit data. Our approach is inspired
by translation mechanisms from knowledge graph embedding and leverages
memory-based attention networks. We empirically show the relevance of this
joint relational modeling, by outperforming existing CML models on
recommendation tasks on several real-world datasets. Our experiments also

IoT-enabled infrastructures face cyber threats due to the wireless nature of

adversaries is a critical task for infrastructure network operators. In this
paper, we establish a three-player three-stage dynamic game-theoretic framework
including two network operators and one attacker to capture the secure design
of multi-layer interdependent infrastructure networks by allocating limited
resources. We use subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPE) to characterize the
strategies of players with sequential moves. In addition, we assess the
efficiency of the equilibrium network by comparing with its team optimal
solution counterparts in which two network operators can coordinate. We further
design a scalable algorithm to guide the construction of the equilibrium
IoT-enabled infrastructure networks. Finally, we use case studies on the

contradictory codes. An ontology of interactive media explains the elusive
visual poetry and image perception. The five basic elements of media are
presented. The model shows the key correlations of user, content, and
