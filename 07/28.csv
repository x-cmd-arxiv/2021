the Penson-Kolb (PK) model, i.e., the tight-binding model for fermionic
particles with the pair-hopping interaction $J$. We focus on the case of
repulsive $J$ (i.e., $J<0$), which can stabilize the eta-pairing
superconductivity with Cooper-pair center-of-mass momentum $\vec{q}=\vec{Q}$,
$\vec{Q}=(\pi/a$,$\pi/a$,\ldots). Numerical calculations are performed for
several $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattices: $d=2$ (the square lattice, SQ),
$d=3$ (the simple cubic lattice) and $d=\infty$ hypercubic lattice (for
arbitrary particle concentration $0<n<2$ and temperature $T$). The ground state
$J$ versus $n$ phase diagrams and the crossover to the Bose-Einstein
condensation regime are analyzed and the evolution of the superfluid
characteristics are examined within the (broken symmetry) Hartree-Fock
approximation (HFA). The critical fields, the coherence length, the London
penetration depth, and the Ginzburg ratio are determined at $T=0$ and $T>0$ as
a function of $n$ and pairing strength. The analysis of the effects of the Fock
term on the ground state phase boundaries and on selected PK model
characteristics is performed as well as the influence of the phase fluctuations
on the eta-pairing superconductivity is investigated. Within the
Kosterlitz-Thouless scenario, the critical temperatures $T_{KT} $ are estimated
for $d=2$ SQ lattice and compared with the critical temperature $T_c$ obtained
from HFA. We also determine the temperature $T_m$ at which minimal gap between
two quasiparticle bands vanishes in the eta-phase. Our results for repulsive
$J$ are contrasted with those found earlier for the PK model with attractive
$J$ (i.e., with $J>0$).

(DNNs) for system identification. Although DNNs show impressive approximation
ability in various fields, several challenges still exist for system
identification problems. First, DNNs are known to be too complex that they can
easily overfit the training data. Second, the selection of the input regressors
for system identification is nontrivial. Third, uncertainty quantification of
the model parameters and predictions are necessary. The proposed Bayesian
approach offers a principled way to alleviate the above challenges by marginal
likelihood/model evidence approximation and structured group sparsity-inducing
priors construction. The identification algorithm is derived as an iterative
regularised optimisation procedure that can be solved as efficiently as
training typical DNNs. Remarkably, an efficient and recursive Hessian
calculation method for each layer of DNNs is developed, turning the intractable
training/optimisation process into a tractable one. Furthermore, a practical
calculation approach based on the Monte-Carlo integration method is derived to
quantify the uncertainty of the parameters and predictions. The effectiveness
of the proposed Bayesian approach is demonstrated on several linear and
nonlinear system identification benchmarks by achieving good and competitive
simulation accuracy. The code to reproduce the experimental results is
open-sourced and available online.

frustrate vortex line pinning we argue that internal magnetic fields must be
stronger than about $10^{16}$ Gauss, which is large enough to prevent
superconductivity in the core and destroy the crustal lattice structure. We
conjecture that the magnetic field inside precessing magnetars has three
components, (1) a dipole component with characteristic strength $\sim 10^{14}$
Gauss; (2) a toroidal component with characteristic strength $\sim
10^{15}-10^{16}$ Gauss which only occupies a modest fraction of the stellar
volume; and (3) a disordered field with characteristic strength $\sim 10^{16}$
Gauss. The disordered field is primarily responsible for permitting precession,
which stops once this field component decays away, which we conjecture happens
after $\sim 1000$ years. Conceivably, as the disordered component damps
bursting activity diminishes and eventually ceases. We model the quadrupolar
magnetic distortion of the star, which is due to its ordered components
primarily, as triaxial and very likely prolate. We address the question of
whether or not the spin frequency ought to be detectable for precessing,
bursting magnetars by constructing a specific model in which bursts happen
randomly in time with random directions distributed in or between cones
relative to a single symmetry axis. Within the context of these specific
models, we find that there are precession geometries for which detecting the
spin frequency is very unlikely.

hypothesizes that the observed data conceal the hidden rules which may be
unraveled by a novel glass-box (as opposed to black-box) physics rule learner
(GPRL) framework. Without any predefined earthquake-related mechanisms or
statistical laws, GPRL's two essentials, convolved information index and
transparent link function, seek generic expressions of rules directly from

suggesting a combination of the pseudo power and the pseudo vorticity of
released energy in the lithosphere. Independent feasibility test supports the
promising role of the unraveled rules in predicting earthquakes' magnitudes and
their specific locations. The identified rules and GPRL are in their infancy
requiring substantial improvement. Still, this study hints at the existence of

People in this special group are eager to pick up the paintbrush, like Leonardo
da Vinci, to create and make full use of their own talents. Therefore, to
maximally bridge this gap, we propose a painting navigation system to assist
blind people in painting and artistic creation. The proposed system is composed
of cognitive system and guidance system. The system adopts drawing board
positioning based on QR code, brush navigation based on target detection and
bush real-time positioning. Meanwhile, this paper uses human-computer
interaction on the basis of voice and a simple but efficient position
information coding rule. In addition, we design a criterion to efficiently
judge whether the brush reaches the target or not. According to the
experimental results, the thermal curves extracted from the faces of testers
show that it is relatively well accepted by blindfolded and even blind testers.
With the prompt frequency of 1s, the painting navigation system performs best
with the completion degree of 89% with SD of 8.37% and overflow degree of 347%
with SD of 162.14%. Meanwhile, the excellent and good types of brush tip
trajectory account for 74%, and the relative movement distance is 4.21 with SD
of 2.51. This work demonstrates that it is practicable for the blind people to
feel the world through the brush in their hands. In the future, we plan to

backstepping control scheme is constructed to fulfill the tracking control of

operating at the Electroweak scale $\Lambda_{EW} \sim 246$ GeV, keeping the

and have masses of the order of $\Lambda_{EW}$. They can be searched for at the
LHC along with heavy mirror quarks and leptons, the lightest of which have
large decay lengths. The seesaw mechanism requires the existence of a complex
scalar which is singlet under the SM gauge group. The imaginary part of this
complex scalar denoted by $A^{0}_s$ is proposed to be the sub-MeV dark matter
candidate in this manuscript. We find that the sub-MeV scalar can serve as a
viable non-thermal feebly interacting massive particle (FIMP)-DM candidate.
This $A_s^0$ can be a naturally light sub-MeV DM candidate due to its nature as
a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone (PNG) boson in the model. We show that the
well-studied freeze out mechanism falls short in this particular framework
producing DM overabundance. We identify that the freeze in mechanism produce
the correct order of relic density for the sub-MeV DM candidate satisfying all
applicable constraints. We then discuss the DM parameter space allowed by the
current bounds from the direct and indirect searches for this sub-MeV DM. This
model has a very rich scalar sector, consistent with various experimental
constraints, predicts a $\sim 125$ GeV scalar with the SM Higgs characteristics

important field in graph theory. The foundation for large flames has been laid
by Lov\'asz: Let $ D=(V,E) $ be a finite digraph and let $ r\in V $. The local
connectivity $ \kappa_D(r,v) $ from $ r $ to $ v $ is defined to be the maximal
number of internally disjoint $ r\rightarrow v $ paths in $ D $. A spanning
subdigraph $ L $ of $ D $ with $ \kappa_L(r,v)=\kappa_D(r,v) $ for every $ v\in
V-r $ must have at least $\sum_{v\in V-r}\kappa_D(r,v) $ edges. Lov\'asz proved
that, maybe surprisingly, this lower bound is sharp for every finite digraph.
  The optimality of an $ L $ sufficing the min-max criteria from Lov\'asz'
theorem may instead also be captured by the following structural
characterization: For every $ v\in V-r $ there is a system $ \mathcal{P}_v $ of
internally disjoint $ r\rightarrow v $ paths in $ L $ covering all the ingoing
edges of $ v $ in $ L $ such that one can choose from each $ P\in \mathcal{P}_v

meets every $ r\rightarrow v $ path of $ D $.
  The positive result for countably infinite digraphs based on this structural
infinite generalisation were obtained by the second author. In this paper we
extend this to digraphs of size $ \aleph_1 $ which requires significantly more

complete understanding of the concept and potentially a proof for arbitrary

strong-disorder renormalization group proofs of continuously varying exponents

descriptions for source code. There are two orthogonal approaches for this
task, i.e., information retrieval (IR) based and neural-based methods. Recent
studies have focused on combining their strengths by feeding the input code and
its similar code snippets retrieved by the IR-based approach to the
neural-based approach, which can enhance the neural-based approach's ability to
output low-frequency words and further improve the performance. However,
despite the tremendous progress, our pilot study reveals that the current
combination is not generalizable and can lead to performance degradation. In
this paper, we propose a straightforward but effective approach to tackle the
issue of existing combinations of these two comment generation approaches.
Instead of binding IR- and neural-based approaches statically, we combine them
in a dynamic manner. Specifically, given an input code snippet, we first use an
IR-based technique to retrieve a similar code snippet from the corpus. Then we
use a Cross-Encoder based classifier to decide the comment generation method to
be used dynamically, i.e., if the retrieved similar code snippet is a true
positive (i.e., is semantically similar to the input), we directly use the
IR-based technique. Otherwise, we pass the input to the neural-based model to
generate the comment. We evaluate our approach on a large-scale dataset of Java
projects. Experiment results show that our approach can achieve 25.45 BLEU
score, which improves the state-of-the-art IR-based approach, neural-based
approach, and their combination by 41%, 26%, and 7%, respectively. We propose a

high-fidelity simulators that adequately capture the variability of real-world

space of simulation scenarios for failures. Adaptive stress testing (AST) is a
method that uses reinforcement learning to find the most likely failure of a
system. AST with a deep reinforcement learning solver has been shown to be
effective in finding failures across a range of different systems. This
approach generally involves running many simulations, which can be very
expensive when using a high-fidelity simulator. To improve efficiency, we
present a method that first finds failures in a low-fidelity simulator. It then
uses the backward algorithm, which trains a deep neural network policy using a
single expert demonstration, to adapt the low-fidelity failures to
high-fidelity. We have created a series of autonomous vehicle validation case
studies that represent some of the ways low-fidelity and high-fidelity
simulators can differ, such as time discretization. We demonstrate in a variety
of case studies that this new AST approach is able to find failures with
significantly fewer high-fidelity simulation steps than are needed when just
running AST directly in high-fidelity. As a proof of concept, we also
demonstrate AST on NVIDIA's DriveSim simulator, an industry state-of-the-art
high-fidelity simulator for finding failures in autonomous vehicles.

be achieved via abundant bandwidth in the terahertz (THz) band. However, THz
waves suffer from severe signal attenuation, which may be compensated by the
reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology with programmable
reflecting elements. Meanwhile, the low VR interaction latency may be achieved
with the mobile edge computing (MEC) network architecture due to its high
computation capability. Motivated by these considerations, in this paper, we
propose a MEC-enabled and RIS-assisted THz VR network in an indoor scenario, by
taking into account the uplink viewpoint prediction and position transmission,
MEC rendering, and downlink transmission. We propose two methods, which are
referred to as centralized online Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and distributed
Federated Averaging (FedAvg), to predict the viewpoints of VR users. In the
uplink, an algorithm that integrates online Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) and
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is deployed to predict the locations and
the line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight statuses of the VR users over time. In
the downlink, we further develop a constrained deep reinforcement learning
algorithm to select the optimal phase shifts of the RIS under latency
constraints. Simulation results show that our proposed learning architecture
achieves near-optimal QoE as that of the genie-aided benchmark algorithm, and
about two times improvement in QoE compared to the random phase shift selection

complex fluids. In model systems particle motion can be tracked, but for

differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) to study flowing highly-concentrated
samples without particle resolution. By combining an investigation of
oscillatory flow, using a novel ""echo-DDM"" analysis, and steady shear, through
flow-DDM, we characterise the yielding of a silicone oil emulsion on both the
microscopic and bulk level. Through measuring the rate of shear-induced droplet
rearrangements and the flow velocity, the transition from a solid-like to
liquid-like state is shown to occur in two steps: with droplet mobilisation
marking the limit of linear visco-elasticity, followed by the development of
shear localisation and macroscopic yielding. Using this suite of techniques,
such insight could be developed for a wide variety of challenging complex
fluids.

the degree of collectivity provides a new, complementary observable to

level of traffic caused by a poor balance between road capacity and traffic
volume. A huge volume of trajectory data which captures real-time traffic
conditions in road networks provides promising new opportunities to identify
the traffic bottlenecks. In this paper, we define this problem as
trajectory-driven traffic bottleneck identification: Given a road network R, a
trajectory database T , find a representative set of seed edges of size K of
traffic bottlenecks that influence the highest number of road segments not in
the seed set. We show that this problem is NP-hard and propose a framework to
find the traffic bottlenecks as follows. First, a traffic spread model is
defined which represents changes in traffic volume for each road segment over
time. Then, the traffic diffusion probability between two connected segments
and the residual ratio of traffic volume for each segment can be computed using
historical trajectory data. We then propose two different algorithmic
approaches to solve the problem. The first one is a best-first algorithm BF,
with an approximation ratio of 1-1/e. To further accelerate the identification
process in larger datasets, we also propose a sampling-based greedy algorithm
SG. Finally, comprehensive experiments using three different datasets compare
and contrast various solutions, and provide insights into important efficiency
and effectiveness trade-offs among the respective methods.

materials for which the stress does not follow from a scalar strain potential.
More in general, hypo-elastic materials are only defined incrementally and
comprise Cauchy-elasticity. Infringement of the hyper-elastic 'dogma' is so far
unattempted and normally believed to be impossible, as it apparently violates
thermodynamics, because energy may be produced in closed strain cycles.
Contrary to this belief, we show that non-hyper-elastic behavior is possible
and we indicate the way to a practical realization of this new concept. In
particular, a design paradigm is established for artificial materials where
follower forces, so far ignored in homogenization schemes, are introduced as
loads prestressing an elastic two-dimensional grid made up of linear elastic
rods (reacting to elongation, flexure and shear). A rigorous application of
Floquet-Bloch wave asymptotics yields an unsymmetric acoustic tensor governing
the \textit{incremental} dynamics of the effective material. The latter is
therefore the incremental response of a hypo-elastic solid, which does not
follow from a strain potential and thus does not belong to hyper-elasticity.
Through the externally applied follower forces (which could be originated via
interaction with a fluid, or gas, or by application of Coulomb friction, or
non-holonomic constraints), the artificial material may adsorb/release energy
from/to the environment and therefore produce energy in a closed strain loop,
without violating any rule of thermodynamics. The solid is also shown to
display flutter, a material instability corresponding to a Hopf bifurcation,
which was advocated as possible in plastic solids, but never experimentally
found and so far believed to be impossible in elasticity.

many schools in London breach the WHO-recommended concentrations of air

significant adverse health effects of air pollutants on children's health. In
this paper we adopted a Bayesian spatial hierarchical model to investigate
factors that affect the odds of schools exceeding the WHO-recommended
concentration of NO2 (i.e., 40 ug/m3 annual mean) in Greater London (UK). We
considered a host of variables including schools' characteristics as well as
their neighbourhoods' attributes from household, socioeconomic,
transport-related, land use, built and natural environment characteristics
perspectives. The results indicated that transport-related factors including
the number of traffic lights and bus stops in the immediate vicinity of
schools, and borough-level bus fuel consumption are determinant factors that
increase the likelihood of non-compliance with the WHO guideline. In contrast,
distance from roads, river transport, and underground stations, vehicle speed
(an indicator of traffic congestion), the proportion of borough-level green
space, and the area of green space at schools reduce the likelihood of
exceeding the WHO recommended concentration of NO2. As a sensitivity analysis,
we repeated our analysis under a hypothetical scenario in which the recommended
concentration of NO2 is 35 ug/m3, instead of 40 ug/m3. Our results underscore
the importance of adopting clean fuel technologies on buses, installing green
barriers, and reducing motorised traffic around schools in reducing exposure to
NO2 concentrations in proximity to schools. This study would be useful for
local authority decision making with the aim of improving air quality for
school-aged children in urban settings.

accurate results while protecting their inputs: the privacy-utility trade-off.
A simple but powerful technique for DP adds noise to sensitivity-bounded query
outputs to blur the exact query output: additive mechanisms. While a vast body
of work considers infinitely wide noise distributions, some applications (e.g.,
real-time operating systems) require hard bounds on the deviations from the
real query, and only limited work on such mechanisms exist. An additive
mechanism with truncated noise (i.e., with bounded range) can offer such hard
bounds. We introduce a gradient-descent-based tool to learn truncated noise for
additive mechanisms with strong utility bounds while simultaneously optimizing
for differential privacy under sequential composition, i.e., scenarios where
multiple noisy queries on the same data are revealed. Our method can learn
discrete noise patterns and not only hyper-parameters of a predefined
probability distribution. For sensitivity bounded mechanisms, we show that it
is sufficient to consider symmetric and that\new{, for from the mean
monotonically falling noise,} ensuring privacy for a pair of representative

shape for $l_2$ utility-loss. For a low number of compositions, we also
improved DP-SGD (sub-sampling). Moreover, we extend Moments Accountant to

nature of matter to enhance classical computation. However, the current Noisy
Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era in quantum computing is characterized by
the use of quantum processors comprising from a few tens to, at most, a few
hundreds of physical qubits without implementing quantum error correction
techniques. This limits the scalability in the implementation of quantum
algorithms. Digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) has been proposed as a more
resilient alternative quantum computing paradigm to outperform digital quantum
computation within the NISQ era framework. It arises from adding the
flexibility provided by fast single-qubit gates to the robustness of analog
quantum simulations. Here, we perform a careful comparison between the digital
and digital-analog paradigms under the presence of noise sources. The
comparison is illustrated by comparing the performance of the quantum Fourier
transform and quantum phase estimation algorithms under a wide range of single-
and two-qubit noise sources. Indeed, we obtain that when the different noise
channels usually present in superconducting quantum processors are considered,
the fidelity of these algorithms for the digital-analog paradigm outperforms
the one obtained for the digital approach. Additionally, this difference grows
when the size of the processor scales up, making DAQC a sensible alternative
paradigm in the NISQ era. Finally, we show how to adapt the DAQC paradigm to
quantum error mitigation techniques for canceling different noise sources,
including the bang error.

torus, in dimensions $d \ge 11$ for the nearest-neighbour model and in
dimensions $d>6$ for spread-out models. For $\mathbb{Z}^d$, we employ a wide
range of techniques and previous results to prove that there exist positive
constants $c$ and $C$ such that the slightly subcritical two-point function and
one-arm probabilities satisfy \[ \mathbb{P}_{p_c-\varepsilon}(0 \leftrightarrow
x) \leq \frac{C}{\|x\|^{d-2}} e^{-c\varepsilon^{1/2} \|x\|} \quad \text{ and }

throughout the critical window the torus two-point function has a ""plateau,""
meaning that it decays for small $x$ as $\|x\|^{-(d-2)}$ but for large $x$ is
essentially constant and of order $V^{-2/3}$ where $V$ is the volume of the
torus. The plateau for the two-point function leads immediately to a proof of
the torus triangle condition, which is known to have many implications for the
critical behaviour on the torus, and also leads to a proof that the critical
values on the torus and on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ are separated by a multiple of
$V^{-1/3}$. The torus triangle condition and the size of the separation of
critical points have been proved previously, but our proofs are different and
are direct consequences of the bound on the $\mathbb{Z}^d$ two-point function.
In particular, we use results derived from the lace expansion on
$\mathbb{Z}^d$, but in contrast to previous work on high-dimensional torus
percolation we do not need or use a separate torus lace expansion.

when to stop training the model, as this has a significant impact on
generalization. Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) comprise
high-dimensional feature spaces formed by the aggregation of multiple channels,
where analyzing intermediate data representations and the model's evolution can
be challenging owing to the curse of dimensionality. We present channel-wise
DeepNNK (CW-DeepNNK), a novel channel-wise generalization estimate based on
non-negative kernel regression (NNK) graphs with which we perform local
polytope interpolation on low-dimensional channels. This method leads to
instance-based interpretability of both the learned data representations and
the relationship between channels. Motivated by our observations, we use
CW-DeepNNK to propose a novel early stopping criterion that (i) does not

allows stopping to be reached at different points for each channel. Our

positive integers such that there is an edge between two vertices if and only
if the sum of their labels is the label of another vertex of the graph. Most
papers on sum graphs consider combinatorial questions like the minimum number
of isolated vertices that need to be added to a given graph to make it a sum
graph. In this paper, we initiate the study of sum graphs from the viewpoint of
computational complexity. Notice that every $n$-vertex sum graph can be
represented by a sorted list of $n$ positive integers where edge queries can be
answered in $O(\log n)$ time. Therefore, limiting the size of the vertex labels
also upper-bounds the space complexity of storing the graph in the database.
  We show that every $n$-vertex, $m$-edge, $d$-degenerate graph can be made a
sum graph by adding at most $m$ isolated vertices to it, such that the size of
each vertex label is at most $O(n^2d)$. This enables us to store the graph
using $O(m\log n)$ bits of memory. For sparse graphs (graphs with $O(n)$
edges), this matches the trivial lower bound of $\Omega(n\log n)$. Since planar
graphs and forests have constant degeneracy, our result implies an upper bound
of $O(n^2)$ on their label size. The previously best known upper bound on the
label size of general graphs with the minimum number of isolated vertices was
$O(4^n)$, due to Kratochv\'il, Miller & Nguyen. Furthermore, their proof was
existential, whereas our labelling can be constructed in polynomial time.

that guarantees authenticity and transferability of arbitrary length messages

has no assumptions on the number of malicious nodes. A consequence of the
absence of the trust assumption in the external subnetwork is the necessity of
assistance from internal subnetwork recipients for the verification of

mixing with a single neutrino flavor. However, the resulting exclusion limits
may not directly constrain the corresponding mixing angles in realistic HNL
models -- those which can explain neutrino oscillations. The reinterpretation
of the results of these experimental searches turns out to be a non-trivial
task, that requires significant knowledge of the details of the experiment. In

decaying promptly to a tri-lepton final state. We show that in a realistic
model with two HNLs, the actual limits can vary by several orders of magnitude
depending on the free parameters of the model. Marginalizing over the unknown
model parameters leads to an exclusion limit on the total mixing angle which
can be up to 3 orders of magnitude weaker than the limits reported in

multiplying the number of domains by the average reduction in
transaction-processing time due to the increase in block size and reduction in
the block-generation-time interval by domain partition. For tamper resistance,
each domain has evidence of the hysteresis signatures of the other domains in
the blockchain. We introduce two types of tamper-resistance-improvement ratios

explain how tamper resistance is improved using our cross-referencing method.
With our method, tamper resistance improves as the number of domains increases.

relation between a response variable and covariates by assuming that some
covariates have a linear relation with the response but each of the others
enter through unknown univariate smooth functions. The harmful effect of
outliers either in the residuals or in the covariates involved in the linear
component has been described in the situation of partially linear models, that
is, when only one nonparametric component is involved in the model. When
dealing with additive components, the problem of providing reliable estimators
when atypical data arise, is of practical importance motivating the need of
robust procedures. Hence, we propose a family of robust estimators for
partially linear additive models by combining $B-$splines with robust linear
regression estimators. We obtain consistency results, rates of convergence and
asymptotic normality for the linear components, under mild assumptions. A Monte
Carlo study is carried out to compare the performance of the robust proposal
with its classical counterpart under different models and contamination
schemes. The numerical experiments show the advantage of the proposed
methodology for finite samples. We also illustrate the usefulness of the

it is related to the downward drift pattern observed in fast radio bursts
(FRBs) is unclear. However, if the FRB down drifting is due to this mechanism
then it will be pronounced in those shocks that have isotropic kinetic energies
$\gtrsim10^{44}$ erg. In this model, for an internal shock with a Lorentz
factor $\sim100$, the normalised drift rate $|{\rm DR_{\rm obs}}|/\nu_{\rm

of the radio pulses. The corresponding radius of the shocked shell is,
therefore, in the range of $10^{10}$ cm and $10^{11}$ cm. This implies that,
for an outflow consisting of hydrogen ion, the upper limit on the mass of the

conductive material in systems governed by local and non-local scalar diffusion
laws. Of particular interest for these problems is the study of the limiting
case, which appears when the amount of available material is driven to zero.
Such a limiting process is of both theoretical and practical interest and
continues to be a subject of active study. In the local case, the limiting
optimization problem is convex and has a well understood basis pursuit
structure. Still this local problem is quite challenging both analytically and
numerically because it is posed in the space of vector-valued Radon measures.
  With this in mind we focus on identifying the vanishing material limit for
the corresponding nonlocal optimal design problem. Similarly to the local case,
the resulting nonlocal problem is convex and has the basis pursuit structure in
terms of nonlocal antisymmetric two-point fluxes. In stark contrast with the
local case, the nonlocal problem admits solutions in Lebesgue spaces with mixed
exponents. When the nonlocal interaction horizon is driven to zero, the
""vanishing material limit"" nonlocal problems provide a one-sided estimate for
the corresponding local measure-valued optimal design problem.
  The surprising fact is that in order to transform the one-sided estimate into
a true limiting process it is sufficient to disregard the antisymmetry
requirement on the two point fluxes. This result relies on duality and requires
generalizing some of the well known nonlocal characterizations of Sobolev
spaces to the case of mixed Lebesgue exponents.

a large amount of matter into massive supershells. If the gas metallicity
($\geq$ Z$_{\odot}$), number density ($\geq 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$) and dust-to-gas
mass ratio ($\sim 1/150 \times Z$) within the supershell are sufficiently
large, such supershells may become optically thick to the starlight emerging
from their host star clusters and even to radiation from the Cosmic Microwave

occurring in the case of massive ($\geq 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$) molecular clouds
hosting $\geq 10^6$ M$_{\odot}$ star clusters, allows a large mass of gas and
dust to acquire a temperature below that of the CMB, whereupon dust grain
growth may occur with ease. In galaxies with total stellar mass $M_{*}$, grain
growth within supershells may increase the dust mass by $\sim 10^6$ M$_{\odot}$

reduced-order models (ROMs) of canonical Hamiltonian systems. Traditional
intrusive projection-based model reduction approaches utilize symplectic
Galerkin projection to construct Hamiltonian ROMs by projecting Hamilton's
equations of the full model onto a symplectic subspace. This symplectic
projection requires complete knowledge about the full model operators and full
access to manipulate the computer code. In contrast, the proposed Hamiltonian
operator inference approach embeds the physics into the operator inference
framework to develop a data-driven model reduction method that preserves the
underlying symplectic structure. Our method exploits knowledge of the
Hamiltonian functional to define and parametrize a Hamiltonian ROM form which
can then be learned from data projected via symplectic projectors. The proposed
method is gray-box in that it utilizes knowledge of the Hamiltonian structure
at the partial differential equation level, as well as knowledge of spatially
local components in the system. However, it does not require access to computer
code, only data to learn the models. Our numerical results demonstrate
Hamiltonian operator inference on a linear wave equation, the cubic nonlinear
Schr\""{o}dinger equation, and a nonpolynomial sine-Gordon equation. Accurate

exceptional points inside hole and electron pockets, which are generally

drastic change of the Fermi surface topology by merging those pockets at
isolated points in the Brillouin zone. We derive simple rules for the evolution

\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, probed at a closest approach time of 310 Myr and a closest
approach distance of 25.4 kpc. This mass is compatible with previous
measurements, showing that a consistent picture is emerging of the LMC's
influence on structures in the Milky Way. Using this sample of streams, we find
that the LMC's effect depends on the relative orientation of the stream and LMC
at their point of closest approach. To better understand this, we present a
simple model based on the impulse approximation and we show that the LMC's
effect depends both on the magnitude of the velocity kick imparted to the
stream and the direction of this kick.

quantities which are referred to as generic entanglement and R\'enyi entropies.
These quantities capture the desired entanglement properties in non-Hermitian
critical systems, where the low-energy properties are governed by the
non-unitary conformal field theories (CFTs). We find excellent agreement
between the numerical extrapolation of the negative central charges from the
generic entanglement/R\'enyi entropy and the non-unitary CFT prediction.
Furthermore, we apply the generic entanglement/R\'enyi entropy to
symmetry-protected topological phases with non-Hermitian perturbations. We find
the generic $n$-th R\'enyi entropy captures the expected entanglement property,
whereas the traditional R\'enyi entropy can exhibit unnatural singularities due
to its improper definition.

subtracting a uniform gradient term $\phi_{\rm{boost}}(\boldsymbol{x}) =

$\boldsymbol{a}_0$. We study this ""boosted potential"" in a variety of scenarios
and propose several applications: (1) The boosted potential can be used to
define a binding criterion that naturally incorporates the effect of tidal
fields. This solves several problems of commonly-used self-potential binding
checks: i) it defines a tidal boundary for each halo, ii) it is much less
likely to misidentify caustics as haloes (specially in the context of warm dark
matter cosmologies), and iii) performs better at identifying virialized regions
of haloes -- yielding to the expected value of 2 for the virial ratio. (2) This
binding check can be generalized to filaments and other cosmic structures. (3)
The boosted potential facilitates the understanding of the disruption of
satellite subhaloes. We propose a picture where most mass loss is explained
through a lowering of the escape energy through the tidal field. (4) We discuss
the possibility of understanding the topology of the potential field in a way
that is independent of constant offsets in the first derivative

work, we investigate the survival and growth of cold gas in such a turbulent,
multi-phase medium using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. Similar
to previous work simulating coherent flow (winds), we find that cold gas
survives if the cooling time of the mixed gas is shorter than the
Kelvin-Helmholtz time of the cold gas clump (with some weak additional Mach
number dependence). However, there are important differences. Near the survival
threshold, the long-term evolution is highly stochastic, and subject to the
existence of sufficiently large clumps. In a turbulent flow, the cold gas
continuously fragments, enhancing its surface area. This leads to exponential
mass growth, with a growth time given by the geometric mean of the cooling and
the mixing time. The fragmentation process leads to a large number of small
droplets which follow a scale-free $\mathrm{d} N/\mathrm{d} m \propto m^{-2}$
mass distribution, and dominate the area covering fraction. Thus, whilst
survival depends on the presence of large `clouds', these in turn produce a
`fog' of smaller droplets tightly coupled to the hot phase which are probed by
absorption line spectroscopy. We show with the aid of Monte-Carlo simulations
that the simulated mass distribution emerges naturally due to the proportional
mass growth and the coagulation of droplets. We discuss the implications of our
results for convergence criteria of larger scale simulations and observations

asymptotic freedom is absent, we determine all interacting fixed points using
perturbation theory up to three loop in the gauge and two loop in the Yukawa

points is narrowed-down by finite-$N$ corrections beyond the Veneziano limit.
We also find a new infrared fixed point whose main features such as scaling
exponents, UV-IR connecting trajectories, and phase diagram are provided. Both
fixed points collide upon varying the number of fermion flavours $N_{\rm f}$,
and conformality is lost through a saddle-node bifurcation. We further revisit
the prospect for ultraviolet fixed points in the large $N_{\rm f}$ limit where
matter field fluctuations dominate. Unlike at weak coupling, we do not find
clear evidence for new scaling solutions even in the presence of scalar and

leptoquarks decaying to quarks and neutrinos, and on models with large extra

PAOFLOW is a software tool that constructs tight-binding Hamiltonians from
self-consistent electronic wavefunctions by projecting onto a set of atomic
orbitals. The electronic structure provides numerous materials properties that
otherwise would have to be calculated via phenomenological models. In this
paper, we describe recent re-design of the code as well as the new features and
improvements in performance. In particular, we have implemented symmetry
operations for unfolding equivalent k-points, which drastically reduces the
runtime requirements of first principles calculations, and we have provided
internal routines of projections onto atomic orbitals enabling generation of
real space atomic orbitals. Moreover, we have included models for non-constant
relaxation time in electronic transport calculations, doubling the real space
dimensions of the Hamiltonian as well as the construction of Hamiltonians
directly from analytical models. Importantly, PAOFLOW has been now converted
into a Python package, and is streamlined for use directly within other Python
codes. The new object oriented design treats PAOFLOWs computational routines as
class methods, providing an API for explicit control of each calculation.

inhomogeneities of the chiral chemical potential mu_5 with a zero mean. We
demonstrate that a small-scale chiral dynamo can occur in such plasmas if
fluctuations of mu_5 are correlated on length scales that are much larger than
the scale on which the dynamo growth rate reaches its maximum. Magnetic
fluctuations grow by many orders of magnitude due to the small-scale chiral
dynamo instability. Once the nonlinear backreaction of the generated magnetic
field on fluctuations of mu_5 sets in, the ratio of these scales decreases and
the dynamo saturates. When magnetic fluctuations grow sufficiently to drive
turbulence via the Lorentz force before reaching maximum field strength, an
additional mean-field dynamo phase is identified. The mean magnetic field grows
on a scale that is larger than the integral scale of turbulence after the
amplification of the fluctuating component saturates. The growth rate of the
mean magnetic field is caused by a magnetic alpha effect that is proportional
to the current helicity. With the onset of turbulence, the power spectrum of
mu_5 develops a universal k^(-1) scaling independently of its initial shape,
while the magnetic energy spectrum approaches a k^(-3) scaling.

that are not available in the training set. In this setting, the standard
evaluation protocol is to use existing action recognition datasets(e.g. UCF101)
and randomly split the classes into seen and unseen. However, most recent work
builds on representations pre-trained on the Kinetics dataset, where classes
largely overlap with classes in the zero-shot evaluation datasets. As a result,
classes which are supposed to be unseen, are present during supervised
pre-training, invalidating the condition of the zero-shot setting. A similar
concern was previously noted several years ago for image based zero-shot
recognition but has not been considered by the zero-shot action recognition
community. In this paper, we propose a new split for true zero-shot action
recognition with no overlap between unseen test classes and training or
pre-training classes. We benchmark several recent approaches on the proposed
True Zero-Shot(TruZe) Split for UCF101 and HMDB51, with zero-shot and
generalized zero-shot evaluation. In our extensive analysis, we find that our
TruZesplits are significantly harder than comparable random splits as nothing
is leaking from pre-training, i.e. unseen performance is consistently lower,up
to 8.9% for zero-shot action recognition. In an additional evaluation we also
find that similar issues exist in the splits used in few-shot action
recognition, here we see differences of up to 17.1%. We publish oursplits1and
hope that our benchmark analysis will change how the field is evaluating zero-

magnetic fields (greater than 10~kT across the fuel), which contain a
significant proportion of the implosion energy and induce large electrical
currents in the plasma. Parameters governing the different magnetization
processes such as Ohmic dissipation and suppression of instabilities by
magnetic tension are presented, allowing for optimization of experiments to
study specific phenomena. For instance, a dopant added to the target gas-fill
can enhance magnetic flux compression while enabling spectroscopic diagnosis of
the imploding core. In particular, the use of Ar K-shell spectroscopy is
investigated by performing detailed non-LTE atomic kinetics and radiative
transfer calculations on the MHD data. Direct measurement of the core electron
density and temperature would be possible, allowing for both the impact of
magnetization on the final temperature and thermal pressure to be obtained. By
assuming the magnetic field is frozen into the plasma motion, which is shown to
be a good approximation for highly magnetized implosions, spectroscopic
diagnosis could be used to estimate which magnetization processes are ruling
the implosion dynamics; for example, a relation is given for inferring whether
thermally-driven or current-driven transport is dominating.

that perturbations with both larger amplitudes and higher mode numbers generate
more magnetic flux. The model allows for greater understanding of which target

to ascertain the time when most magnetic flux is generated. If generation is
weighted more towards early times, then more high-mode magnetic field loops
will be present. A hot-spot with no high-mode perturbations at time of peak
neutron production can still contain significant magnetic flux on those scales.
By assuming that magnetic flux is deposited at the hot-spot edge by Nernst

potentials due to a dominant dark energy component in the $\Lambda$CDM model.
The aspect that makes the ISW effect distinctly interesting is the repeated
observation of stronger-than-expected imprints from supervoids at
$z\lesssim0.9$. Here we analyze the un-probed key redshift range $0.8<z<2.2$
where the ISW signal is expected to fade in $\Lambda$CDM, due to a weakening
dark energy component, and eventually become consistent with zero in the matter
dominated epoch. On the contrary, alternative cosmological models, proposed to
explain the excess low-$z$ ISW signals, predicted a sign-change in the ISW
effect at $z\approx1.5$ due to the possible growth of large-scale potentials
that is absent in the standard model. To discriminate, we estimated the
high-$z$ $\Lambda$CDM ISW signal using the Millennium XXL mock catalogue, and
compared it to our measurements from about 800 supervoids identified in the
eBOSS DR16 quasar catalogue. At $0.8<z<1.2$, we found an excess ISW signal with
$A_\mathrm{ ISW}\approx3.6\pm2.1$ amplitude. The signal is then consistent with
the $\Lambda$CDM expectation ($A_\mathrm{ ISW}=1$) at $1.2<z<1.5$ where the
standard and alternative models predict similar amplitudes. Most interestingly,
we also detected an opposite-sign ISW signal at $1.5<z<2.2$ that is in
$2.7\sigma$ tension with the $\Lambda$CDM prediction. Taken at face value,
these moderately significant detections of ISW anomalies suggest an alternative
growth rate of structure in low-density environments at $\sim100~h^{-1}{\rm

structures, yet their dynamics in cases where transition probabilities are not
static remain under explored and poorly understood. Here we study nonlinear
random walks that occur when transition probabilities depend on the state of
the system. We show that when these transition probabilities are non-monotonic,
i.e., are not uniformly biased towards the most densely or sparsely populated
nodes, but rather direct random walkers with more nuance, chaotic dynamics
emerge. Using multiple transition probability functions and a range of networks
with different connectivity properties, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is
generic. Thus, when such non-monotonic properties are key ingredients in
nonlinear transport applications complicated and unpredictable behaviors may
result.

Amplification By Reversible Exchange (SABRE) and extended SABRE (X-SABRE) are
efficient and low-cost methods for generating large polarizations on a variety

field approaches, where hyperpolarization is generated directly in the

selectively hyperpolarize single targets. Here we introduce a new pulse
sequence-based approach that affords broadband excitation of SABRE
hyperpolarization at high magnetic fields without having to tailor pulse
sequence parameters to specific targets. This permits simultaneous
hyperpolarization of multiple targets for the first time at high field and
offers a direct approach to integration of high-field SABRE hyperpolarization
into routine NMR applications, such as NMR-based metabonomics and biomolecular

show that the derived category of $R$ is equivalent to the chain homotopy
category of all K-flat complexes with pure-injective components. This is
implicitly related to a recollement we exhibit. It expresses
$\mathcal{D}_{pur}(R)$, the pure derived category of $R$, as an attachment of
the usual derived category $\mathcal{D}(R)$ with Emmanouil's quotient category
$\mathcal{D}_{K-flat}(R):=K(R)/K-Flat$, which here we call the K-flat derived

triangulated category. We obtain our results by using methods of cotorsion
pairs to construct (cofibrantly generated) monoidal abelian model structures on
the exact category of chain complexes along with the degreewise pure exact
structure. In fact, most of our model structures are obtained as corollaries of
a general method which associates an abelian model structure to any class of
so-called $\mathcal{C}$-acyclic complexes, where $\mathcal{C}$ is any given

calculating metrics on a small item subset (target set) to speed up
computation. The target set contains the relevant item and a set of negative
items that are sampled from the full item set. Two well-known strategies to
sample negative items are uniform random sampling and sampling by popularity to
better approximate the item frequency distribution in the dataset. Most
recently published papers on sequential item recommendation rely on sampling by
popularity to compare the evaluated models. However, recent work has already
shown that an evaluation with uniform random sampling may not be consistent
with the full ranking, that is, the model ranking obtained by evaluating a
metric using the full item set as target set, which raises the question whether
the ranking obtained by sampling by popularity is equal to the full ranking. In
this work, we re-evaluate current state-of-the-art sequential recommender
models from the point of view, whether these sampling strategies have an impact
on the final ranking of the models. We therefore train four recently proposed
sequential recommendation models on five widely known datasets. For each
dataset and model, we employ three evaluation strategies. First, we compute the
full model ranking. Then we evaluate all models on a target set sampled by the
two different sampling strategies, uniform random sampling and sampling by
popularity with the commonly used target set size of 100, compute the model
ranking for each strategy and compare them with each other. Additionally, we
vary the size of the sampled target set. Overall, we find that both sampling
strategies can produce inconsistent rankings compared with the full ranking of
the models. Furthermore, both sampling by popularity and uniform random
sampling do not consistently produce the same ranking ...

concerns about the security of underlying data and the consistency of replicas
in the presence of malicious attacks. A prominent solution in this direction is
to employ a permissioned blockchain framework that is modeled around
traditional Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols. Any federated
application expects its data to be globally scattered to achieve faster access.
But, prior works have shown that traditional BFT protocols are slow. This has
led to the rise of sharded-replicated blockchains. Existing BFT protocols for
these sharded blockchains are efficient if client transactions require access
to a single-shard, but face performance degradation if there is a cross-shard
transaction that requires access to multiple shards. As cross-shard
transactions are common, to resolve this dilemma, we present RingBFT, a novel
meta-BFT protocol for sharded blockchains. RingBFT requires shards to adhere to
the ring order, and follow the principle of process, forward, and re-transmit
while ensuring the communication between shards is linear. Our evaluation of
RingBFT against state-of-the-art sharding BFT protocols illustrates that
RingBFT achieves up to 18x higher throughput, gracefully scales to nearly 500
globally distributed nodes, and achieves a peak throughput of 1.2 million
transactions per second.

and plays a key role in many photochemical and photobiological reactions. For
this reason, and because of the large size of the systems treated, many papers
have appeared with density-functional theory (DFT) treatments of the reactions
of 1 O 2 with different chemical species. The present work serves as a reminder
that the common assumption that it is enough to fix the spin multipicity as
unity is not enough to insure a correct treatment of singlet oxygen. We review
the correct group theoretical treatment of the three lowest energy electronic
states of O 2 which, in the case of 1 O 2 is often so badly explained in the
relevant photochemical literature that the explanation borders on being
incorrect and prevents, rather than encourages, a correct treatment of this
interesting and important photochemical species. We then show how many
electronic structure programs, such as a freely downloadable and

with the multiplet sum method (MSM), to obtain a more accurate estimation of
the potential energy curves (PECs) of the two 1 O 2 states. Various strengths
and weaknesses of different DFAs emerge through our application of the MSM
method. In particular, the quality of the a 1 Delta g excitation energy
reflects how well functionals are able to describe the spin-flip energy in DFT
while the quality of the b 1 Sigma + g excitation energy reflects how well
functionals are able to describe the spin-pairing energy in DFT. Finally we

approaches inspired by the brain's incredible efficiency and capabilities. Most
NMC research, which aims to replicate the brain's computational structure and
architecture in man-made hardware, has focused on artificial intelligence;
however, less explored is whether this brain-inspired hardware can provide
value beyond cognitive tasks. We demonstrate that high-degree parallelism and
configurability of spiking neuromorphic architectures makes them well-suited to
implement random walks via discrete time Markov chains. Such random walks are
useful in Monte Carlo methods, which represent a fundamental computational tool
for solving a wide range of numerical computing tasks. Additionally, we show
how the mathematical basis for a probabilistic solution involving a class of
stochastic differential equations can leverage those simulations to provide
solutions for a range of broadly applicable computational tasks. Despite being
in an early development stage, we find that NMC platforms, at a sufficient
scale, can drastically reduce the energy demands of high-performance computing
(HPC) platforms.

  Random Demand",,,,,"math.OC cs.DM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  On-demand delivery has become increasingly popular around the world.
Motivated by a large grocery chain store who offers fast on-demand delivery
services, we model and solve a stochastic dynamic driver dispatching and
routing problem for last-mile delivery systems where on-time performance is the
main target. The system operator needs to dispatch a set of drivers and specify
their delivery routes facing random demand that arrives over a fixed number of
periods. The resulting stochastic dynamic program is challenging to solve due
to the curse of dimensionality. We propose a novel structured approximation
framework to approximate the value function via a parametrized dispatching and
routing policy. We analyze the structural properties of the approximation
framework and establish its performance guarantee under large-demand scenarios.
We then develop efficient exact algorithms for the approximation problem based
on Benders decomposition and column generation, which deliver verifiably
optimal solutions within minutes. The evaluation results on a real-world data
set show that our framework outperforms the current policy of the company by
36.53% on average in terms of delivery time. We also perform several policy
experiments to understand the value of dynamic dispatching and routing with
varying fleet sizes and dispatch frequencies.

semi-supervised node classification problems. A variety of graph neural network
(GNN) based approaches have been proposed to tackle these problems, which
typically determine output labels through feature aggregation. This can be
problematic, as it implies conditional independence of output nodes given
hidden representations, despite their direct connections in the graph. To learn
the direct influence among output nodes in a graph, we propose the Explicit
Pairwise Factorized Graph Neural Network (EPFGNN), which models the whole graph
as a partially observed Markov Random Field. It contains explicit pairwise
factors to model output-output relations and uses a GNN backbone to model
input-output relations. To balance model complexity and expressivity, the
pairwise factors have a shared component and a separate scaling coefficient for
each edge. We apply the EM algorithm to train our model, and utilize a
star-shaped piecewise likelihood for the tractable surrogate objective. We
conduct experiments on various datasets, which shows that our model can
effectively improve the performance for semi-supervised node classification on
graphs.

is adopted to use classical failure criteria at the bond level, which readily

to a collection station at the edge of the field. A step toward increasing

$\alpha$, of waiting time distributions. Statistically independent events with
linear behavior can be characterized by binomial, Gaussian, exponential, or
Poissonian size distribution functions. In contrast, physical processes with
nonlinear behavior exhibit spatio-temporal coherence (or memory) and ""fat
tails"" in their size distributions that fit power law-like functions, as a
consequence of the time variability of the mean event rate, as demonstrated by
means of Bayesian block decomposition in the work of Wheatland et al.~(1998).
  In this study we conduct numerical simulations of waiting time distributions
$N(\tau)$ in a large parameter space for various (polynomial, sinusoidal,
Gaussian) event rate functions $\lambda(t)$, parameterized with an exponent $p$
that expresses the degree of the polynomial function $\lambda(t) \propto t^p$.
We derive an analytical exact solution of the waiting time distribution
function in terms of the incomplete gamma function, which is similar to a
Pareto type-II function and has a power law slope of $\alpha = 2 + 1/p$, in the
asymptotic limit of large waiting times. Numerically simulated random
distributions reproduce this theoretical prediction accurately. Numerical
simulations in the nonlinear regime ($p \ge 2$) predict power law slopes in the
range of $2.0 \le \alpha \le 2.5$. The self-organized criticality model yields
a prediction of $\alpha=2$. Observations of solar flares and coronal mass
ejections (over at least a half solar cycle) are found in the range of
$\alpha_{obs} \approx 2.1-2.4$. Deviations from strict power law functions are
expected due to the variability of the flare event rate $\lambda(t)$, and
deviations from theoretically predicted slope values $\alpha$ occur due to the
Poissonian weighting bias of power law fits.

interface is uniquely defined. For a cubic computational cell (3D), the
position of the planar interface is determined by intersecting the cube with a

we can recover the original sine-Gordon model or its two-frequency version. The

a trained professional. In an attempt to expedite this process, an active area
of research involves automating cell classification through use of deep
learning-based techniques. In practice, a large amount of data is required to
accurately train these deep learning models. However, due to the sparse human
cell datasets currently available, the performance of these models is typically
low. This study investigates the feasibility of using few-shot learning-based
techniques to mitigate the data requirements for accurate training. The study
is comprised of three parts: First, current state-of-the-art few-shot learning
techniques are evaluated on human cell classification. The selected techniques
are trained on a non-medical dataset and then tested on two out-of-domain,
human cell datasets. The results indicate that, overall, the test accuracy of
state-of-the-art techniques decreased by at least 30% when transitioning from a
non-medical dataset to a medical dataset. Second, this study evaluates the
potential benefits, if any, to varying the backbone architecture and training
schemes in current state-of-the-art few-shot learning techniques when used in
human cell classification. Even with these variations, the overall test
accuracy decreased from 88.66% on non-medical datasets to 44.13% at best on the
medical datasets. Third, this study presents future directions for using
few-shot learning in human cell classification. In general, few-shot learning
in its current state performs poorly on human cell classification. The study
proves that attempts to modify existing network architectures are not effective
and concludes that future research effort should be focused on improving
robustness towards out-of-domain testing using optimization-based or
self-supervised few-shot learning techniques.

functions are simply a set of well-chosen exponentials, so the corresponding
expansion may be thought of as a discrete form of the Lehmann representation
using an effective spectral density which is a sum of $\delta$ functions. The
basis is determined only by an upper bound on the product $\beta
\omega_{\max}$, with $\beta$ the inverse temperature and $\omega_{\max}$ an
energy cutoff, and a user-defined error tolerance $\epsilon$. The number $r$ of
basis functions scales as $\mathcal{O}\left(\log(\beta \omega_{\max}) \log
(1/\epsilon)\right)$. The discrete Lehmann representation of a particular
imaginary time Green's function can be recovered by interpolation at a set of
$r$ imaginary time nodes. Both the basis functions and the interpolation nodes
can be obtained rapidly using standard numerical linear algebra routines. Due
to the simple form of the basis, the discrete Lehmann representation of a
Green's function can be explicitly transformed to the Matsubara frequency
domain, or obtained directly by interpolation on a Matsubara frequency grid. We

improve a WFS's measurement error (i.e., the wavefront level at which photon
noise, detector noise, and/or sky background limits a WFS measurement) and
linearity (i.e., the wavefront level, in the absence of photon noise, aliasing,
and servo lag, at which an AO loop can close and the corresponding closed-loop
residual level). We present one such design here called the bright pyramid WFS
(bPWFS), which improves both the linearity and measurement errors as compared
to the non-modulated pyramid WFS (PWFS). The bPWFS is a unique design that,
unlike other WFSs, doesn't sacrifice measurement error for linearity,
potentially enabling this WFS to (a) close the AO loop on open loop turbulence
utilising a tip/tilt modulation mirror (i.e., a modulated bPWFS; analogous to
the procedure used for the regular modulated PWFS), and (b) reach deeper
closed-loop residual wavefront levels (i.e., improving both linearity and
measurement error) compared to the regular non-modulated PWFS. The latter
approach could be particularly beneficial to enable improved AO performance
using the bWFS as a second stage AO WFS. In this paper we will present an AO

mitigate the need for labels, we attempt to use self-supervised learning, a
type of learning where models use the data contained within the images
themselves as labels. It is challenging to accomplish though, since the task is
two-fold: the images and captions come from two different modalities and
usually handled by different types of networks. It is thus not obvious what a
completely self-supervised solution would look like. How it would achieve
captioning in a comparable way to how self-supervision is applied today on
image recognition tasks is still an ongoing research topic. In this project, we
are using an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder is a convolutional
neural network (CNN) trained on OpenImages dataset and learns image features in
a self-supervised fashion using the rotation pretext task. The decoder is a
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and it is trained, along within the image
captioning model, on MS COCO dataset and is responsible of generating captions.

fine-tuned model generated outputs whose length was more similar to that of the
therapists compared to the pre-trained model; (3) both the pre-trained model

extracted from Streptococcus pyogenes, known as SpyRing, has been widely used
to improve the thermal resilience of enzymes, the assembly of biostructures,
cancer cell recognition and other fields. In SpyRing, the two termini of the
target enzyme are respectively linked to the peptide SpyTag and its protein
partner SpyCatcher. SpyTag spontaneously reacts with SpyCatcher to form an
isopeptide bond, with which the target enzyme forms a close ring structure. It
was believed that the covalent cyclization of protein skeleton caused by
SpyRing reduces the conformational entropy of biological structure and improves
its rigidity, thus improving the thermal resilience of the target enzyme.
However, the effects of SpyTag/ SpyCatcher interaction with this enzyme are
poorly understood, and their regulation of enzyme properties remains unclear.
Here, for simplicity, we took the single domain enzyme lichenase from Bacillus
subtilis 168 as an example, studied the interface interactions in the SpyRing
system by molecular dynamics simulations, and examined the effects of the
changes of electrostatic interaction and van der Waals interaction on the
thermal resilience of target enzyme. The simulations showed that the interface
between SpyTag/SpyCatcher and lichenase is different from that found by
geometric matching method and highlighted key mutations that affect the
intensity of interactions at the interface and might have effect on the thermal
resilience of the enzyme. Our calculations provided new insights into the
rational designs in the SpyRing.

from the standpoint of the camera's image signal processor (ISP). A camera's
ISP is hardware that applies a series of in-camera image processing and color
manipulation steps, many of which are nonlinear in nature, to render the
initial sensor image to its final photo-finished representation saved in the
8-bit standard RGB (sRGB) color space. As white balance (WB) is one of the
major procedures applied by the ISP for color correction, this thesis presents
two different methods for ISP white balancing. Afterward, we discuss another
scenario of correcting and editing image colors, where we present a set of
methods to correct and edit WB settings for images that have been improperly
white-balanced by the ISP. Then, we explore another factor that has a
significant impact on the quality of camera-rendered colors, in which we
outline two different methods to correct exposure errors in camera-rendered
images. Lastly, we discuss post-capture auto color editing and manipulation. In
particular, we propose auto image recoloring methods to generate different
realistic versions of the same camera-rendered image with new colors. Through
extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our methods provide superior
solutions compared to existing alternatives targeting color correction, color

generalizability of deep neural networks is difficult to control, existing
models such as autoencoder do not work well. In this work, we interpret the
reconstruction of an image as a divide-and-assemble procedure. Surprisingly, by
varying the granularity of division on feature maps, we are able to modulate
the reconstruction capability of the model for both normal and abnormal
samples. That is, finer granularity leads to better reconstruction, while
coarser granularity leads to poorer reconstruction. With proper granularity,
the gap between the reconstruction error of normal and abnormal samples can be
maximized. The divide-and-assemble framework is implemented by embedding a
novel multi-scale block-wise memory module into an autoencoder network.
Besides, we introduce adversarial learning and explore the semantic latent
representation of the discriminator, which improves the detection of subtle
anomaly. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the challenging MVTec AD

Classical model-based approaches for ultrasound elastography use deterministic

utilize fixed regularizers for various tissue patterns while appropriate
data-adaptive priors might be required for capturing the complex spatial
elasticity distribution. In this regard, we propose a joint model-based and

a regularized optimization problem. We present an integrated objective function
composed of a statistical physics-based forward model and a data-driven
regularizer to leverage deep neural networks for learning the underlying

For
that, we consider the diffraction of electromagnetic (EM) waves by an extended,
weakly aspherical, gravitating object. We account for the static gravitational
field of such a lens by representing its exterior potential in the most generic
form, expressed via an infinite set of symmetric trace free (STF) tensor
multipole mass moments. This yields the most general form of the gravitational
phase shift, which allows for a comprehensive description of the optical
properties of a generic gravitational lens. We found that at each order of the
STF moments, the gravitational phase shift is characterized by only two
parameters: a magnitude and a rotation angle that characterize the
corresponding caustics, which form in the point spread function (PSF) of the
lens. Both of these parameters are uniquely expressed in terms of the
transverse-trace free (TT) projections of the multipole moments on the lens
plane. Not only does this result simplify the development of physically
consistent models of realistic lenses, it also drastically reduces the number
of required parameters in the ultimate model. To help with the interpretation
of the results, we established the correspondence of the gravitational phase
shift expressed via the TT-projected STF multipole mass moments and its
representation via spherical harmonics. For axisymmetric mass distributions,
the new results are consistent with those that we obtained in previous studies.
For arbitrary mass distributions, our results are novel and offer new insight
into gravitational lensing by realistic astrophysical systems. These findings
are discussed in the context of ongoing astrophysical gravitational lensing

operate with little effective accountability or checks and balances,
traditional horizontal or vertical accountability proved to be very blunt and
weak. In the presence of such faulty mechanisms, ordinary citizens access to
information is frequently denied, and their voices are kept mute. It impasses
the formation of an enabling environment, where activists and civil society
institutions representing the ordinary peoples interest are actively
discouraged. They become vulnerable to retribution. Social accountability, on
the other hand, provides an enabling environment for activists and civil
society institutions to operate freely. Thus, leaders and administration become
more accountable to people. An enabling environment means providing legal
protection, enhancing the availability of information and increasing citizen
voice, strengthening institutional and public service capacities and directing
incentives that foster accountability. Donors allocate significant shares of
resources to encouraging civil society to partner with elites rather than
holding them accountable. This paper advocate for a stronger legal environment
to protect critical civil society and whistle-blowers, and for independent

bulk computations of such quantities contributions from spacetime wormholes
which link separate asymptotic boundaries threaten to spoil this property,
leading to a ""factorization puzzle."" Certain simple models like JT gravity have
wormholes, but bulk computations in them correspond to averages over an
ensemble of boundary systems. These averages need not factorize. We can
formulate a toy version of the factorization puzzle in such models by focusing
on a specific member of the ensemble where partition functions will again
factorize.
  As Coleman and Giddings-Strominger pointed out in the 1980s, fixed members of
ensembles are described in the bulk by ""$\alpha$-states"" in a many-universe
Hilbert space. In this paper we analyze in detail the bulk mechanism for
factorization in such $\alpha$-states in the topological model introduced by
Marolf and Maxfield (the ""MM model"") and in JT gravity. In these models
geometric calculations in $\alpha$ states are poorly controlled. We circumvent
this complication by working in $\textit{approximate}$ $\alpha$ states where
bulk calculations just involve the simplest topologies: disks and cylinders.
  One of our main results is an effective description of the factorization
mechanism. In this effective description the many-universe contributions from
the full $\alpha$ state are replaced by a small number of effective boundaries.
Our motivation in constructing this effective description, and more generally
in studying these simple ensemble models, is that the lessons learned might
have wider applicability. In fact the effective description lines up with a
recent discussion of the SYK model with fixed couplings arXiv:2103.16754. We
conclude with some discussion about the possible applicability of this
effective model in more general contexts.

consistent with the photometric period. Minimum and maximum light occur at the
orbital quadratures Phi=0.25 and 0.75, respectively, and cannot be caused by
reflection on the brown dwarf, but, instead, by a spot on the synchronously
rotating magnetic white dwarf. The brown dwarf does not fill its Roche lobe and
the system may be in a low-accretion state or, more likely, in a detached state
following episodes of mass transfer. SMSS J160639.78-100010.7 is the nearest

originates from disk coronae or jets is still under debate. For example, the
positive relationships in radio-quiet (RQ) AGNs (such as the optical to X-ray
spectral index $\alpha_{\rm {OX}}$ and Eddington ration $\lambda_{\rm {O}}$ as
well as the X-ray photon index $\Gamma$ and $\lambda_{\rm {O}}$) are not
detected in RLAGNs. We intend to further investigate this issue in this work. A
sample of 27 luminous sources (including 16 quasars and 11 high-excitation
radio galaxies) was selected from the 3CRR catalog to reinvestigate the origin
of X-ray emission in RLAGNs, where the X-ray and mid-infrared fluxes are
observed by Chandra/XMM-Newton and Spitzer, respectively. It is found for the
first time that there is a significant relationship between the mid-infrared to
X-ray spectral index $\alpha_{\rm {IX}}$ and $\lambda_{\rm {IR}}$ for whole
sample, while there is no relationship between $\alpha_{\rm {OX}}$ and
$\lambda_{\rm {O}}$ in quasars. There are strong positive relationships between
both $L_{\rm {R}}$-$L_{\rm {X}}$ and $L_{\rm {UV}}$-$L_{\rm {X}}$ panels, which
can be well fitted by the disk-corona model. However, there is no significant
relationship between $\Gamma$ and $\lambda_{\rm {IR}}$. The possible reason is
related to the effects of the large-scale magnetic field in RLAGNs. We suggest
that the X-ray emission in high-excitation RLAGNs originates from a disk-corona
system.

attention-in-attention CycleGAN (AIA-CycleGAN) for non-parallel speech

methods, the limited mapping ability of the generator may cause performance
degradation and insufficient feature learning. To alleviate this degradation,
we propose an integration of adaptive time-frequency attention (ATFA) and
adaptive hierarchical attention (AHA) to form an attention-in-attention (AIA)
module for more flexible feature learning during the mapping procedure. More
specifically, ATFA can capture the long-range temporal-spectral contextual
information for more effective feature representations, while AHA can flexibly
aggregate different AFTA's intermediate output feature maps by adaptive
attention weights depending on the global context. Numerous experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves consistently more
superior performance over previous GAN-based and CycleGAN-based methods in
non-parallel training. Moreover, experiments in parallel training verify that
the proposed AIA-CycleGAN also outperforms most advanced GAN-based and Non-GAN

around objects to make them indistinguishable from their homogeneous
surroundings. Typically, methods based on material-parameter transformations
are used to design optical, thermal and electric cloaks. However, they are not
applicable in designing mechanical cloaks, since continuum-mechanics equations
are not form-invariant under general coordinate transformations. As a result,
existing design methods for mechanical cloaks have so far been limited to a
narrow selection of voids with simple shapes. To address this challenge, we
present a systematic, data-driven design approach to create mechanical cloaks
composed of aperiodic metamaterials using a large pre-computed unit cell
database. Our method is flexible to allow the design of cloaks with various
boundary conditions, multiple loadings, different shapes and numbers of voids,
and different homogeneous surroundings. It enables a concurrent optimization of
both topology and properties distribution of the cloak. Compared to
conventional fixed-shape solutions, this results in an overall better cloaking
performance, and offers unparalleled versatility. Experimental measurements on
3D-printed structures further confirm the validity of the proposed approach.
Our research illustrates the benefits of data-driven approaches in quickly
responding to new design scenarios and resolving the computational challenge

generalized to accommodate other applications that require heterogeneous

model 2p XAS model Hamiltonian approaches (MHA) are fast and accurate in

L-edge of light transition metals ions for elements from Ti to Ni, including
different oxidation states, from sets of physical input parameters.
Computational performance and accuracy were optimized through a systematic

remains more accurate due to the statistical nature of the developed machine
learning method, the ANN-based prediction of 2p XAS spectra achieved good

replacing the corresponding convolution module with MPVConv, we show that
MPVConv can fit in different backbones to solve a wide range of 3D tasks.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets such as ShapeNet Part, S3DIS and

the generalized formula for the mild solution as well as the smoothing effects
of resolvent operators are proved. For the IVP associated with the first one,
by using the Orlicz space with the function $ \Xi(z)=e^{|z|^p}-1$ and some
embeddings between it and the usual Lebesgue spaces, we prove that the solution
is a global-in-time solution or it shall blow up in a finite time if the
initial value is regular. In the case of singular initial data, the
local-in-time/global-in-time existence and uniqueness are derived. Also, the
regularity of the mild solution is investigated. For the IVP associated with

we propose a Gaussian quantum metrology scheme using bimodal quantized optical

non-Markovian dynamics. Our result gives an efficient way to realize
high-precision quantum metrology in practical continuous-variable systems.

exact expressions for the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and

such as the outage probability, average bit error rate, and average channel

galaxies (ELGs) is a primary objective for upcoming cosmological spectroscopic
surveys. The source of strong emission of ELGs is nebular emission from
surrounding ionized gas irradiated by massive short-lived stars in star-forming
galaxies. As a result, ELGs are more likely to reside in newly-formed halos and
this leads to a nonlinear relation between ELG number density and matter
density fields. In order to estimate the covariance matrix of cosmological
observables, it is essential to produce many independent realisations to
simulate ELG distributions for large survey volumes. To this end, we present a
novel and fast scheme to populate ELGs in dark-matter only $N$-body simulations
based on local density field. This method enables fast production of mock ELG
catalogues suitable for verifying analysis methods and quantifying
observational systematics in upcoming spectroscopic surveys and can populate
ELGs in moderately high-density regions even though the halo structure cannot
be resolved due to low resolution. The power spectrum of simulated ELGs is
consistent with results of hydrodynamical simulations up to fairly small scales
($\lesssim 1 h \, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$), and the simulated ELGs are more likely
to be found in filamentary structures, which is consistent with results of
semi-analytic and hydrodynamical simulations. Furthermore, we address the
redshift-space power spectrum of simulated ELGs. The measured multipole moments
of simulated ELGs clearly exhibit a weaker Finger-of-God effect than those of
matter due to infalling motions towards halo centre, rather than random virial
motions inside halos.

training and deployment, among which keypoint-based approaches show promising
improvement in efficiency by simplifying dense image prediction to light
keypoint prediction. However, keypoint locations are often modeled only as
continuous coordinates, so noise from semantically insignificant deviations in
videos easily disrupt learning stability, leading to inaccurate keypoint
modeling. In this paper, we design a new grid keypoint learning framework,
aiming at a robust and explainable intermediate keypoint representation for
long-term efficient video prediction. We have two major technical
contributions. First, we detect keypoints by jumping among candidate locations
in our raised grid space and formulate a condensation loss to encourage
meaningful keypoints with strong representative capability. Second, we
introduce a 2D binary map to represent the detected grid keypoints and then
suggest propagating keypoint locations with stochasticity by selecting entries
in the discrete grid space, thus preserving the spatial structure of keypoints
in the longterm horizon for better future frame generation. Extensive
experiments verify that our method outperforms the state-ofthe-art stochastic
video prediction methods while saves more than 98% of computing resources. We

problems such as imbalanced learning and recommender systems. The vast majority

paper, we start an early trial to consider the problem of learning multiclass
scoring functions via optimizing multiclass AUC metrics. Our foundation is
based on the M metric, which is a well-known multiclass extension of AUC. We
first pay a revisit to this metric, showing that it could eliminate the
imbalance issue from the minority class pairs. Motivated by this, we propose an
empirical surrogate risk minimization framework to approximately optimize the M
metric. Theoretically, we show that: (i) optimizing most of the popular
differentiable surrogate losses suffices to reach the Bayes optimal scoring
function asymptotically; (ii) the training framework enjoys an imbalance-aware
generalization error bound, which pays more attention to the bottleneck samples
of minority classes compared with the traditional $O(\sqrt{1/N})$ result.
Practically, to deal with the low scalability of the computational operations,
we propose acceleration methods for three popular surrogate loss functions,
including the exponential loss, squared loss, and hinge loss, to speed up loss
and gradient evaluations. Finally, experimental results on 11 real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

vector-like fermion singlets charged under a dark $U(1)_D$ gauge symmetry to
describe the dark sector. While the presence of light vector boson mediator
leads to sufficient DM self-interactions to address the small scale issues of
cold dark matter, the model with sub-GeV scale DM can explain the XENON1T
excess via elastic scattering of boosted DM component with electrons at the
detector. Strong annihilation of DM into the light mediator leads to a
suppressed thermal relic. A hybrid setup of dark freeze-out and non-thermal

abundance. We fit our model with XENON1T data and also find the final parameter

The theory is based on an adiabaticity hypothesis which assumes that

complementary information to each other that may not be evident when working

tasks where audio-visual data is available. This paper presents a multi-modal
model for automatic scene classification that exploits simultaneously auditory
and visual information. The proposed approach makes use of two separate
networks which are respectively trained in isolation on audio and visual data,
so that each network specializes in a given modality. The visual subnetwork is
a pre-trained VGG16 model followed by a bidiretional recurrent layer, while the
residual audio subnetwork is based on stacked squeeze-excitation convolutional
blocks trained from scratch. After training each subnetwork, the fusion of
information from the audio and visual streams is performed at two different
stages. The early fusion stage combines features resulting from the last
convolutional block of the respective subnetworks at different time steps to
feed a bidirectional recurrent structure. The late fusion stage combines the
output of the early fusion stage with the independent predictions provided by
the two subnetworks, resulting in the final prediction. We evaluate the method
using the recently published TAU Audio-Visual Urban Scenes 2021, which contains
synchronized audio and video recordings from 12 European cities in 10 different

the key to achieving high-efficiency network operation. In this paper, we
develop a model-free and data-driven routing strategy by leveraging

from the experience to make some good routing configurations for the future.
Considering the graph nature of the network topology, we design a multi-agent
RL framework in combination with Graph Neural Network (GNN), tailored to the

from those works focusing on discovering membership of a given data point, in

(TableGAN-MCA), which allows an adversary given only synthetic entries randomly
sampled from a black-box generator to recover partial GAN training data.
Namely, a GAN-synthesized table immune to state-of-the-art MI attacks is
vulnerable to the TableGAN-MCA. The success of TableGAN-MCA is boosted by an
observation that GAN-synthesized tables potentially collide with the training
data of the generator.
  Our experimental evaluations on TableGAN-MCA have five main findings. First,
TableGAN-MCA has a satisfying training data recovery rate on three commonly
used real-world datasets against four generative models. Second, factors,
including the size of GAN training data, GAN training epochs and the number of
synthetic samples available to the adversary, are positively correlated to the
success of TableGAN-MCA. Third, highly frequent data points have high risks of
being recovered by TableGAN-MCA. Fourth, some unique data are exposed to
unexpected high recovery risks in TableGAN-MCA, which may attribute to GAN's
generalization. Fifth, as expected, differential privacy, without the
consideration of the correlations between features, does not show commendable
mitigation effect against the TableGAN-MCA. Finally, we propose two mitigation
methods and show promising privacy and utility trade-offs when protecting

lowest mean absolute error (MAE) among deep learning-based method under medium

outperforming the Physnet by 80$\%$. Additionally, we investigate potential
methods for improving performance of deep learning-based methods. We find that
brightness augmentation make model more robust to variation illumination. These

immune function, where directed chemical potentials of the system constitute a
space of interactions. In the physical sense, the humoral adaptive immune
system adjusts the chemical potential of all available antigenic molecules by
tuning the chemical potential and organizing the network hierarchy of its
sensor-effector molecules, antibodies. The coupling of sensors and effectors
allows the system to adjust the thermodynamic activity of antigens and
antibodies, while network organization helps minimize chemical potentials and
maximize diversity. Mathematically the system couples the variance of Gaussian
distributed interaction energies in its interaction space to the exponentially
distributed chemical potentials of its effector molecules to maintain its
stationary state. This process creates a scale-free network in interaction
space, where absolute thermodynamic activity corresponds to node degree. In the
thermodynamic interpretation, the system is an ensemble carrying out {mu}N
work, adjusting chemical potentials according to the changes in the chemical
potentials of the surroundings. The validity of the model is supported by
identifying an interaction flexibility index, the corresponding variables in
thermodynamics and network science, and by confirming its applicability to the
humoral immune system. Overall, this statistical thermodynamics model of
adaptive immunity describes how adaptive biological self-organization arises
from the maintenance of a scale-free, directed interaction network with fractal

Optics Facility and must achieve 150 $\mu$as astrometric precision (50 $\mu$as

simulate MAVIS images. MAVISIM accounts for three major sources of astrometric

tip-tilt residual error and static field distortion. When exploring the impact
of these three error terms alone, we recover an astrometric accuracy of 50
$\mu$as for all stars brighter than $m=19$ in a 30s integration using
PSF-fitting photometry. We also assess the feasibility of MAVIS detecting an
intermediate mass black hole (IMBH) in a Milky Way globular cluster. We use an
N-body simulation of an NGC 3201-like cluster with a central 1500 M$_{\odot}$
IMBH as input to MAVISIM and recover the velocity dispersion profile from
proper motion measurements. Under favourable astrometric conditions, the
dynamical signature of the IMBH is detected with a precision of ~0.20 km/s in
the inner ~4"" of the cluster where HST is confusion-limited. This precision is
comparable to measurements made by Gaia, HST and MUSE in the outer ~60"" of the

astrometric error budget for an MCAO system and a prediction of what MAVIS
could do once on sky.

computer-aided diagnostic methods that combine deep learning with structural
magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) have achieved encouraging results, but some

In this research, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning approach for
automated diagnosis of AD and localization of important brain regions related
to the disease from sMRI data. This approach is based on a 2D single model
strategy and has the following differences from the current approaches: 1)
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models of different structures and
capacities are evaluated systemically and the most suitable model is adopted
for AD diagnosis; 2) a data augmentation strategy named Two-stage Random
RandAugment (TRRA) is proposed to alleviate the overfitting issue caused by
limited training data and to improve the classification performance in AD
diagnosis; 3) an explainable method of Grad-CAM++ is introduced to generate the
visually explainable heatmaps that localize and highlight the brain regions
that our model focuses on and to make our model more transparent. Our approach
has been evaluated on two publicly accessible datasets for two classification
tasks of AD vs. cognitively normal (CN) and progressive MCI (pMCI) vs. stable
MCI (sMCI). The experimental results indicate that our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art approaches, including those using multi-model and 3D CNN
methods. The resultant localization heatmaps from our approach also highlight
the lateral ventricle and some disease-relevant regions of cortex, coincident
with the commonly affected regions during the development of AD.

and the task is to decide whether there exists a subset of $X$ which sums to
$t$. A recent line of research has resulted in $\tilde{O}(t)$-time algorithms,
which are (near-)optimal under popular complexity-theoretic assumptions. On the
other hand, the standard dynamic programming algorithm runs in time $O(n \cdot
|\mathcal{S}(X,t)|)$, where $\mathcal{S}(X,t)$ is the set of all subset sums of
$X$ that are smaller than $t$. Furthermore, all known pseudopolynomial
algorithms actually solve a stronger task, since they actually compute the
whole set $\mathcal{S}(X,t)$.
  As the aforementioned two running times are incomparable, in this paper we
ask whether one can achieve the best of both worlds: running time
$\tilde{O}(|\mathcal{S}(X,t)|)$. In particular, we ask whether
$\mathcal{S}(X,t)$ can be computed in near-linear time in the output-size.
Using a diverse toolkit containing techniques such as color coding, sparse

question and design an algorithm running in time

  Central to our approach is the study of top-$k$-convolution, a natural
problem of independent interest: given sparse polynomials with non-negative
coefficients, compute the lowest $k$ non-zero monomials of their product. We
design an algorithm running in time $\tilde{O}(k^{4/3})$, by a combination of
sparse convolution and sumset estimates considered in Additive Combinatorics.
Moreover, we provide evidence that going beyond some of the barriers we have
faced requires either an algorithmic breakthrough or possibly new techniques

the self-sensing of soft EA tube actuators based on the concept of guided
circumferential elastic waves. Both circumferential SH and Lamb-type waves in
an incompressible soft EA cylindrical tube under inhomogeneous biasing fields
are considered. The biasing fields, induced by the application of an electric
voltage difference to the electrodes on the inner and outer cylindrical
surfaces of the EA tube in addition to an axial pre-stretch, are inhomogeneous
in the radial direction. Dorfmann and Ogden's theory of nonlinear
electroelasticity and the associated linear theory for small incremental motion
constitute the basis of our analysis. By means of the state-space formalism for
the incremental wave motion along with the approximate laminate technique,
dispersion relations are derived in a particularly efficient way. For a
neo-Hookean ideal dielectric model, the proposed approach is first validated
numerically. Numerical examples are then given to show that the guided
circumferential wave propagation characteristics are significantly affected by
the inhomogeneous biasing fields and the geometrical parameters. Some
particular phenomena such as the frequency veering and the nonlinear dependence
of the phase velocity on the radial electric voltage are discussed. Our
numerical findings demonstrate that it is feasible to use guided
circumferential elastic waves for the ultrasonic non-destructive online SHM to
detect interior structural defects or fatigue cracks and for the self-sensing

  Presence of Disturbances and Uncertainties",,,,,"math.OC cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we study mixed traffic systems that move along a single-lane
ring-road or open-road. The traffic flow forms a platoon, which includes a
number of heterogeneous human-driven vehicles (HDVs) together with only one
connected and automated vehicle (CAV) that receives information from several
neighbors. The dynamics of HDVs are assumed to follow the optimal velocity
model (OVM), and the acceleration of the single CAV is directly controlled by a
dynamical output-feedback controller. The ultimate goal of this work is to
present a robust control strategy that can smoothen the traffic flow in the
presence of undesired disturbances (e.g. abrupt deceleration) and parametric
uncertainties. A prerequisite for synthesizing a dynamical output controller is
the stabilizability and detectability of the underlying system. Accordingly, a
theoretical analysis is presented first to prove the stabilizability and
detectability of the mixed traffic flow system. Then, two H-infinity control
strategies, with and without considering uncertainties in the system dynamics,
are designed. The efficiency of the two control methods is subsequently
illustrated through numerical simulations, and various experimental results are
presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller to
mitigate disturbance amplification and achieve platoon stability.

custom loss function was able to achieve perfect classification for the tiny
RoI of $75\times 75$ size. The model is end-to-end and few-shot and therefore
is very efficient in terms of time and energy requirements. The system can be
used in many ways including device unlocking and secure authentication. To the

distinctly important for piezoelectric nanomaterials with inherent large
surface-to-volume ratio. In this paper, we investigate the surface effect on
the free vibration behavior of a spherically isotropic piezoelectric
nanosphere. Instead of directly using the well-known Huang-Yu surface
piezoelectricity theory (HY theory), another general framework based on a thin
shell layer model is proposed. A novel approach is developed to establish the
surface piezoelectricity theory or the effective boundary conditions for
piezoelectric nanospheres employing the state-space formalism. Three different
sources of surface effect can be identified in the first-order surface
piezoelectricity, i.e. the electroelastic effect, the inertia effect, and the
thickness effect. It is found that the proposed theory becomes identical to the
HY theory for a spherical material boundary if the transverse stress (TS)
components are discarded and the electromechanical properties are properly
defined. The nonaxisymmetric free vibration of a piezoelectric nanosphere with
surface effect is then studied and an exact solution is obtained. In order to
investigate the surface effect on the natural frequencies of piezoelectric
nanospheres, numerical calculations are finally performed. Our numerical
findings demonstrate that the surface effect, especially the thickness effect,
may have a particularly significant influence on the free vibration of
piezoelectric nanospheres. This work provides a more accurate prediction of the
dynamic characteristics of piezoelectric nanospherical devices in

accuracy relations of smoothness indicators of WENO-JS would differ from that
assuming critical points occurring on grid nodes, and accordingly the global
smoothness indicator in WENO-Z scheme will differ from the original one. Based
on above understandings, we first discuss several issues regarding current
third-order WENO-Z improvements (e.g. WENO-NP3, -F3, -NN3, -PZ3 and -P+3), i.e.
the numerical results with scale dependency, the validity of analysis assuming
critical points occurring on nodes, and the sensitivity regarding computational
time step and initial condition in order convergence studies. By analyses and
numerical validations, the defections of present improvements are demonstrated,
either scale-dependency of results or failure to recover optimal order when
critical points occurring at half nodes, then a generic analysis is provided
which considers the first-order critical point occurring within grid intervals.
Based on achieved theoretical outcomes, two scale-independent, third-order
WENO-Z schemes are proposed which could truly recover the optimal order at
critical points: the first one is acquired by limited expansion of grid
stencil, deriving new global smoothness indicator and incorporating with the
mapping function; the second one is achieved by further expanding grid stencil
and employing a different global smoothness indicator. For validating, typical
1-D scalar advection problems, 1-D and 2-D problems by Euler equations are
chosen and tested. The consequences verify the optimal order recovery at
critical points by proposed schemes and show that: the first scheme outperforms
aforementioned third-order WENO-Z improvements in terms of numerical
resolution, while the second scheme indicates weak numerical robustness in
spite of improved resolution and is mainly of theoretical significance

sequence to sequence(seq2seq) architecture. The proposed method is applied to
the short-term forecasts of passenger flow in Shenzhen Metro, China. The
experimental results show that MGC-RNN outperforms the benchmark algorithms in
terms of forecasting accuracy. Besides, it is found that the inter-station
driven by network distance, network structure, and recent flow patterns are
significant factors for passenger flow forecasting. Moreover, the architecture
of LSTM-encoder-decoder can capture the temporal dependencies well. In general,
the proposed framework could provide multiple views of passenger flow dynamics

periods of time, posing a complementary approach to traditional methods in the
social sciences. Millions of texts from social media can be processed with
computational methods to study emotions over time and across regions. However,
recent research has shown weak correlations between social media emotions and
affect questionnaires at the individual level and between static regional
aggregates of social media emotion and subjective well-being at the population
level, questioning the validity of social media data to study emotions. Yet, to
date, no research has tested the validity of social media emotion macroscopes
to track the temporal evolution of emotions at the level of a whole society.
Here we present a pre-registered prediction study that shows how
gender-rescaled time series of Twitter emotional expression at the national
level substantially correlate with aggregates of self-reported emotions in a
weekly representative survey in the United Kingdom. A follow-up exploratory
analysis shows a high prevalence of third-person references in
emotionally-charged tweets, indicating that social media data provide a way of
social sensing the emotions of others rather than just the emotional
experiences of users. These results show that, despite the issues that social
media have in terms of representativeness and algorithmic confounding, the
combination of advanced text analysis methods with user demographic information
in social media emotion macroscopes can provide measures that are informative
of the general population beyond social media users.

have previously been observed with Very Long Baseline Array at 7 mm. They
exhibit a complex polarization structure surrounding the optically thick and
compact subparsec-scale core. However, given the low level of linear
polarization in the core, it is required to verify that this complex structure
does not originate from residual instrumental polarization signals in the data.
We have performed a new analysis of the same data sets observed in four epochs
by using the Generalized Polarization CALibration pipeline (GPCAL). This novel
instrumental polarization calibration pipeline overcomes the limitations of
LPCAL, a conventional calibration tool used in the previous M87 studies. The
resulting images show a compact linear polarization structure with its peak
nearly coincident with the total intensity peak, which is significantly
different from the results of previous studies. The core linear polarization is
characterized as fractional polarization of $\sim0.2-0.6$% and polarization
angles of $\sim66-92^\circ$, showing moderate variability. We demonstrate that,
based on tests with synthetic data sets, LPCAL using calibrators having complex
polarization structures cannot achieve sufficient calibration accuracy to
obtain the true polarization image of M87 due to a breakdown of the ""similarity
approximation"". We find that GPCAL obtains more accurate D-terms than LPCAL by
using observed closure traces of calibrators that are insensitive to both
antenna gain and polarization leakage corruptions. This study suggests that
polarization imaging of very weakly polarized sources has become possible with
the advanced instrumental polarization calibration techniques.

And Data Acquisition (SCADA) system gathering vast amounts of operational data
that can be used for analysis to improve operation and maintenance of turbines.
We analyze high frequency SCADA-data from the Thanet offshore wind farm in the
UK and evaluate Pearson correlation matrices for a variety of observables with
a moving time window. This renders possible an assessment of non-stationarity
in mutual dependencies of different types of data. Drawing from our experience
in other complex systems, such as financial markets and traffic, we show this
by employing a hierarchical $k$-means clustering algorithm on the correlation
matrices. The different clusters exhibit distinct typical correlation
structures to which we refer as states. Looking first at only one and later at
multiple turbines, the main dependence of these states is shown to be on wind
speed. In accordance, we identify them as operational states arising from
different settings in the turbine control system based on the available wind
speed. We model the boundary wind speeds separating the states based on the
clustering solution. This allows the usage of our methodology as a
pre-processing for analysis, e.g. failure detection or prediction, by sorting
new data based on wind speed and comparing it to the respective operational
state, thereby taking the non-stationarity into account.

relativistic electrons. We are able to strongly constrain the frequency of

field strength of synchrotron absorption allowed us to estimate the magnetic
field strength of the eclipse medium to be $\sim$13 $\mathrm{G}$, which is very
similar to the values obtained by considering a pressure balance between the
incident pulsar wind and the stellar wind of the companion. Applying this
method to other millisecond binary pulsars will enable us to determine if the

approaches have been proposed to provide monocular gastroendoscopy with

a novel supervised approach to train depth and pose estimation networks using
consecutive endoscopy images to assist the endoscope navigation in the stomach.
We firstly generate real depth and pose training data using our previously

ability between computer-generated (CG) models and real data for the stomach.
In addition, we propose a novel generalized photometric loss function to avoid
the complicated process of finding proper weights for balancing the depth and
the pose loss terms, which is required for existing direct depth and pose

discriminative features to adapt to the depth changes of the objects. Besides,
we introduce an auxiliary module to improve the detection model by jointly

proposes a spatial uncertainty-aware semi-supervised approach via regularized
surrogate task (binary segmentation) for crowd counting problems. Different
from existing semi-supervised learning-based crowd counting methods, to exploit
the unlabeled data, our proposed spatial uncertainty-aware teacher-student

Specifically, we estimate the spatial uncertainty maps from the teacher model's
surrogate task to guide the feature learning of the main task (density
regression) and the surrogate task of the student model at the same time.
Besides, we introduce a simple yet effective differential transformation layer
to enforce the inherent spatial consistency regularization between the main

task to yield more reliable predictions and generates high-quality uncertainty
maps. Thus, our model can also address the task-level perturbation problems
that occur spatial inconsistency between the primary and surrogate tasks in the

Neural field theories are appropriate modelling paradigms for topographic

based on deep and complex systems that often cannot operate in real-time,
making them impractical for video-surveillance. In this paper we present a
long-term, multi-face tracking architecture conceived for working in crowded
contexts where faces are often the only visible part of a person. Our system
benefits from advances in the fields of face detection and face recognition to
achieve long-term tracking, and is particularly unconstrained to the motion and
occlusions of people. It follows a tracking-by-detection approach, combining a
fast short-term visual tracker with a novel online tracklet reconnection
strategy grounded on rank-based face verification. The proposed rank-based
constraint favours higher inter-class distance among tracklets, and reduces the
propagation of errors due to wrong reconnections. Additionally, a correction
module is included to correct past assignments with no extra computational
cost. We present a series of experiments introducing novel specialized metrics
for the evaluation of long-term tracking capabilities, and publicly release a
video dataset with 10 manually annotated videos and a total length of 8' 54"".
Our findings validate the robustness of each of the proposed modules, and
demonstrate that, in these challenging contexts, our approach yields up to 50%
longer tracks than state-of-the-art deep learning trackers.

leading to serious yield losses globally. Accurate diagnosis of the disease at
early stage is critical for precision disease control and management. Current
farm practices in crop disease diagnosis are based on manual visual inspection,
which is costly, time consuming, subject to individual bias. Recent advances in
imaging sensors (e.g. RGB, multiple spectral and hyperspectral cameras), remote
sensing and machine learning offer the opportunity to address this challenge.
Particularly, hyperspectral imagery (HSI) combining with machine learning/deep
learning approaches is preferable for accurately identifying specific plant
diseases because the HSI consists of a wide range of high-quality reflectance
information beyond human vision, capable of capturing both spectral-spatial
information. The proposed method considers the potential disease specific
reflectance radiation variance caused by the canopy structural diversity,
introduces the multiple capsule layers to model the hierarchical structure of
the spectral-spatial disease attributes with the encapsulated features to
represent the various classes and the rotation invariance of the disease
attributes in the feature space. We have evaluated the proposed method with the
real UAV-based HSI data under the controlled field conditions. The
effectiveness of the hierarchical features has been quantitatively assessed and
compared with the existing representative machine learning/deep learning

improves the accuracy performance when considering hierarchical-structure of

well-established ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray (UHECR) candidate accelerators
FR-1 and FR-2 galaxies. Their much higher number density -- up to a factor five
times more numerous than FR-1 with $z\leq 0.05$ -- makes them good candidate
sources for an isotropic contribution to the observed UHECR flux. Here, the
acceleration and survival of UHECR in prevailing conditions of the FR-0
environment are discussed.
  First, an average spectral energy distribution (SED) is compiled based on the
\textit{FR0CAT}. These photon fields, composed of a jet and a host galaxy
component, form a minimal target photon field for the UHECR, which will suffer
from electromagnetic pair production, photo-disintegration, photo-meson
production losses, and synchrotron radiation. The two most promising
acceleration scenarios based on Fermi-I order and gradual shear acceleration
are discussed as well as different escape scenarios.
  When an efficient acceleration mechanism precedes gradual shear acceleration,
e.g., Fermi-I or others, FR-0 galaxies are likely UHECR accelerators. Gradual
shear acceleration requires a jet Lorentz factor of $\Gamma>1.6$, to be faster
than the corresponding escape. In less optimistic models, a contribution to the
cosmic-ray flux between the knee and ankle is expected to be relatively
independent of the realized turbulence and acceleration.

important properties with wedge domains in Minkowski space. If G is semisimple,
there exist unitary representations of G and isotone covariant nets of real
subspaces defined for any open subset of M, which assign to connected

relations, rather than alone. The social groups thus formed, in variable
proportions depending on the context, are not randomly organised but exhibit
distinct features, such as the well-known tendency of 3-member groups to be
arranged in a V-shape. The existence of group structures is thus likely to
impact the collective dynamics of the crowd, possibly in a critical way when
emergency situations are considered. After turning a blind eye to these group
aspects for years, endeavours to model groups in crowd simulation software have
thrived in the past decades. This fairly short review opens on a description of
their empirical characteristics and their impact on the global flow. Then, it
aims to offer a pedagogical discussion of the main strategies to model such
groups, within different types of models, in order to provide guidance for

electronics and internet of things (IoT) applications due to the low
propagation loss and long transmission range. However, because the dimension of
electrical antenna is comparable to one quarter wavelength of the
electromagnetic wave that it transmits and receives, currently a gap exists
between LF communication systems and IoT, as IoT generally implement
miniaturized electrical antennas with a small wavelength at a high frequency
while traditional LF electrical antennas are too bulky. In this paper, we
present an LF magnetoelectric mechanical transmitting and receiving antenna
pair to significantly miniaturize the dimension of LF antennas. As the
operation principle of the magnetoelectric mechanical antenna pair is based on
mechanical resonance, its dimension is reduced by four orders of magnitude
compared with an electrical antenna counterpart. The transmitting and receiving
antennas are the same in structure and dimensions: they are both composed of
magnetostrictive Terfenol-D and piezoelectric PZT laminate, and their
dimensions are both 38x12x8.2mm3. Both the transmitting and receiving antennas
are integrated with DC magnetic bias to improve its performance. Antenna pair
performance measurement demonstrates that a maximum operation distance of 9m is
demonstrated with DC magnetic bias, while maximum operation distance without DC
magnetic bias is 4m, which is reduced by 56%. The LF magnetoelectric mechanical
antenna pair may be a promising candidate for the portable electronics and IoT
applications.

hypothesis on how the link between the patch behaviour and failing test
specifications can be drawn: similar failing test cases should require similar
patches. We then propose BATS, an unsupervised learning-based system to predict
patch correctness by checking patch Behaviour Against failing Test
Specification. BATS exploits deep representation learning models for code and
patches: for a given failing test case, the yielded embedding is used to
compute similarity metrics in the search for historical similar test cases in
order to identify the associated applied patches, which are then used as a
proxy for assessing generated patch correctness. Experimentally, we first
validate our hypothesis by assessing whether ground-truth developer patches
cluster together in the same way that their associated failing test cases are
clustered. Then, after collecting a large dataset of 1278 plausible patches
(written by developers or generated by some 32 APR tools), we use BATS to
predict correctness: BATS achieves an AUC between 0.557 to 0.718 and a recall
between 0.562 and 0.854 in identifying correct patches. Compared against
previous work, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art
performance in patch correctness prediction, without the need for large labeled
patch datasets in contrast with prior machine learning-based approaches. While
BATS is constrained by the availability of similar test cases, we show that it
can still be complementary to existing approaches: used in conjunction with a
recent approach implementing supervised learning, BATS improves the overall
recall in detecting correct patches. We finally show that BATS can be
complementary to the state-of-the-art PATCH-SIM dynamic approach of identifying
the correct patches for APR tools.

characterize equilibria via a convexification technique using the Nikaido-Isoda

further develop this approach along three dimensions. We first show that for
quasi-linear models, where a convexified instance exists in which for fixed

the GNEP to a standard (non-linear) optimization problem. Secondly, we derive
two complete characterizations of those GNEPs for which the convexification
leads to a jointly constrained or a jointly convex GNEP, respectively. These
characterizations require new concepts related to the interplay of the convex

theory. Specifically, we compare the interaction network of essential and
nonessential genes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Most remarkably, this
well-established combined framework by measuring the node participation ratio
$(NPR)$ index helps detect important genes, which control the insightful
structural patterns in the underlying networks. Results indicate that the
essential genes have higher values of $NPR$ rather than the nonessential ones
which means that they have the most contribution to the network structure. It
is worth mentioning that among all essential genes, the $NPR$ value of 5
significant ones is considerably higher than the other essential genes, and
also the same is for 15 significant nonessential genes compared to the others.
Thus, the significant essential genes strongly manage their network structure,
while the significant nonessential genes, besides their global contributions,
have weak effects on their network structure. Most strikingly, these genes
existing in a limited number of structural patterns are responsible for the
specific bioprocesses which are the signature of their networks.

quasi periodic nature even in the absence of damping. Another interesting
finding is that the magnetic field may induce an asymmetric splitting of the
spectrum of the output signal with two peaks in the case of a driven damped two
dimensional harmonic oscillator. One more additional peak may appear for the
three dimensional case. In some cases the spectrum may have similarity with the
Normal Zeeman Effect. At the same time one may observe to appear the anti
resonance phenomenon even for the driven damped cyclotron motion where the
system with the purely non conservative force fields is driven by an electric
field. Finally, our calculation exhibits how the magnetic field can modulate
the phase difference (between input and output signals) and the efficiency like

the joint Galactic merger rate. We follow previous analyses by modelling the
underlying pulsar population of nine merging DNS systems and study the impact
and resulting uncertainties when replacing simplifying assumptions made in the
past with actual knowledge of the beam shape, its extent and the viewing

increases to $R = 6^{+28}_{-5}$ Myr$^{-1}$ although the values is still
consistent with previous estimates given the uncertainties. We also compute
contributions to the merger rates from the other DNS systems by applying a
generic beam shape derived from that of PSR J1906+0746, evaluating the impact
of previous assumptions. We derive a joint Galactic DNS merger rate of
$R^{\rm{gen}}_{\rm{MW}} = 32^{+19}_{-9}$Myr$^{-1}$, leading to a LIGO detection
rate of ${R}^{\rm{gen}}_{\rm{LIGO}} = 3.5^{+2.1}_{-1.0}$Myr$^{-1}$ (90% conf.

according to addition theorem for Hankel functions that appear in Green
function of 2-D homogeneous media. In this regard, recursive formulas in
spatial frequency domain are derived and the scattering field is rewritten into
inward and outward components and, then, the primary 2-D problem can be solved
using 1D FFT in the stabilized biconjugate-gradient fast Fourier transform
BCGS-FFT algorithm. Because the emerging method obtains 1D FFT over a circle,
there is no need to expand an object region by zero padding, whereas it is
necessary for conventional 2D FFT approach. Therefore, the method saves lots of
memory and time over the conventional approach. other interesting aspect of the
proposed method is that the field on a circle outside a scattering object, can
be calculated efficiently using an analytical formula. This is, particularly,
attractive in electromagnetic inverse scattering problems and microwave
imaging. The numerical examples for 2-D TM problems demonstrate merits of

fundamental challenge that has been intensively studied during the last decade.
Currently existing solutions for this problem either build a sparse
multiplicative spanner of the input graph and compute shortest paths in the
spanner offline, or compute an exact single source BFS tree.
  Solutions of the first type are doomed to incur a stretch-space tradeoff of
$2\kappa-1$ versus $n^{1+1/\kappa}$, for an integer parameter $\kappa$. (In
fact, existing solutions also incur an extra factor of $1+\epsilon$ in the
stretch for weighted graphs, and an additional factor of $\log^{O(1)}n$ in the
space.) The only existing solution of the second type uses $n^{1/2 -
O(1/\kappa)}$ passes over the stream (for space $O(n^{1+1/\kappa})$), and
applies only to unweighted graphs.
  In this paper we show that $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate single-source shortest
paths can be computed in this setting with $\tilde{O}(n^{1+1/\kappa})$ space
using just \emph{constantly} many passes in unweighted graphs, and
polylogarithmically many passes in weighted graphs (assuming $\epsilon$ and
$\kappa$ are constant). Moreover, in fact, the same result applies for
multi-source shortest paths, as long as the number of sources is
$O(n^{1/\kappa})$.
  We achieve these results by devising efficient dynamic streaming
constructions of $(1 + \epsilon, \beta)$-spanners and hopsets. We believe that
these constructions are of independent interest.

  Networks","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2106.12807",,,,"cs.LG cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) exhibit excellent performance when graphs have
strong homophily property, i.e. connected nodes have the same labels. However,
they perform poorly on heterophilic graphs. Several approaches address the
issue of heterophily by proposing models that adapt the graph by optimizing
task-specific loss function using labelled data. These adaptations are made
either via attention or by attenuating or enhancing various
low-frequency/high-frequency signals, as needed for the task at hand. More
recent approaches adapt the eigenvalues of the graph. One important
interpretation of this adaptation is that these models select/weigh the
eigenvectors of the graph. Based on this interpretation, we present an
eigendecomposition based approach and propose EigenNetwork models that improve
the performance of GNNs on heterophilic graphs. Performance improvement is
achieved by learning flexible graph adaptation functions that modulate the
eigenvalues of the graph. Regularization of these functions via parameter
sharing helps to improve the performance even more. Our approach achieves up to
11% improvement in performance over the state-of-the-art methods on
heterophilic graphs.

problem tasked with finding a sequence of container relocations required to
retrieve all containers by a given order. Due to the complexity of this
problem, heuristic methods are often applied to obtain acceptable solutions in
a small amount of time. These include relocation rules (RRs) that determine the
relocation moves that need to be performed to efficiently retrieve the next
container based on certain yard properties. Such rules are often designed
manually by domain experts, which is a time-consuming and challenging task.
This paper investigates the application of genetic programming (GP) to design
effective RRs automatically. The experimental results show that GP evolved RRs
outperform several existing manually designed RRs. Additional analyses of the
proposed approach demonstrate that the evolved rules generalise well across a
wide range of unseen problems and that their performance can be further
enhanced. Therefore, the proposed method presents a viable alternative to
existing manually designed RRs and opens a new research direction in the area
of container relocation problems.

monolayer 2D-Xene materials with large intrinsic spin-orbit coupling. In
contrast with conventional quantum spin-Hall edge states localized around the
$X$-points, the interface states appearing at the domain wall between
topologically distinct phases are either from the $K$ or $K^{'}$ points, making
them suitable prospects for serving as valley-polarized channels. We show that
the presence of a large band-gap quantum spin Hall effect enables the spatial
separation of the spin-valley locked helical interface states with the valley
states being protected by spin conservation, leading to a robustness against
short-range non-magnetic disorder. By adopting the scattering matrix formalism
on a suitably designed device structure, valley-resolved transport in the
presence of non-magnetic short-range disorder for different 2D-Xene materials
is also analyzed in detail. Our numerical simulations confirm the role of
spin-orbit coupling in achieving an improved valley filter performance with a
perfect quantum of conductance attributed to the topologically protected

material, device geometry and other factors that need to be considered while
designing an optimized valleytronic filter device.

of the resource environment.
  Objective. In this study, we investigate whether performance tests of
serverless applications are stable, that is, if their results are reproducible,
and what implications the serverless paradigm has for performance tests.
  Method. We conduct a case study where we collect two datasets of performance
test results: (a) repetitions of performance tests for varying memory size and
load intensities and (b) three repetitions of the same performance test every
day for ten months.
  Results. We find that performance tests of serverless applications are
comparatively stable if conducted on the same day. However, we also observe
short-term performance variations and frequent long-term performance changes.
  Conclusion. Performance tests for serverless applications can be stable;
however, the serverless model impacts the planning, execution, and analysis of
performance tests.

coupling (SOC) effect, the band structures are spin-polarized with Dirac points
at the Fermi level. Remarkably, the 1T-LuN2 monolayer shows an isotropic
magnetic anisotropy energy in the xy-plane with in-plane magnetization,
indicating easy tunability of the magnetization direction. When rotating the
magnetization vector in the xy-plane, our proposed model can accurately
describe the variety of the SOC band gap and two topological states (Weyl-like
semimetal and Chern insulator states) appear with tunable properties. The
Weyl-like semimetal state is a critical point between the two Chern insulator
states with opposite sign of the Chern numbers. The large nontrivial band gap
(up to 60.3 meV) and the Weyl-like semimetal state are promising for
applications in spintronic devices.

  In this work, we propose a novel reliability optimization framework for

network reliability in the series-parallel graphs of Satyanarayana and
Wood(1985) to formulate the reliability optimization problem as a mixed-integer
nonlinear optimization problem. To solve this nonconvex problem, we use
classical convex envelopes of bilinear functions, introduce custom cutting
planes, and propose a new family of convex envelopes for expressions that
appear in the evaluation of network reliability. Furthermore, we exploit the
refinements produced by spatial branch-and-bound to locally strengthen our
convex relaxations. Our experiments show that, using our framework, one can
efficiently obtain optimal solutions in challenging instances of this problem.

(CNNs) are prone to noise interruptions, i.e. the CNN output can be drastically
changed by small image noise. To improve the noise robustness, we try to
integrate CNNs with wavelet by replacing the common down-sampling (max-pooling,
strided-convolution, and average pooling) with discrete wavelet transform
(DWT). We firstly propose general DWT and inverse DWT (IDWT) layers applicable
to various orthogonal and biorthogonal discrete wavelets like Haar, Daubechies,
and Cohen, etc., and then design wavelet integrated CNNs (WaveCNets) by
integrating DWT into the commonly used CNNs (VGG, ResNets, and DenseNet).
During the down-sampling, WaveCNets apply DWT to decompose the feature maps
into the low-frequency and high-frequency components. Containing the main
information including the basic object structures, the low-frequency component
is transmitted into the following layers to generate robust high-level
features. The high-frequency components are dropped to remove most of the data
noises. The experimental results show that %wavelet accelerates the CNN
training, and WaveCNets achieve higher accuracy on ImageNet than various
vanilla CNNs. We have also tested the performance of WaveCNets on the noisy
version of ImageNet, ImageNet-C and six adversarial attacks, the results
suggest that the proposed DWT/IDWT layers could provide better noise-robustness
and adversarial robustness. When applying WaveCNets as backbones, the
performance of object detectors (i.e., faster R-CNN and RetinaNet) on COCO

aliasing effect, i.e. separation of low frequency and high frequency

In large extra

the Sun via the axion-photon coupling, $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$, and we derive the
number density of KK axions that get trapped into the solar gravitational field
and then accumulate over cosmic times. The large multiplicity of states, as
well as their masses in the keV-range, deeply alter the phenomenology of the
axion. This scenario leads us to propose the presence of KK axions as an

conclusion stems from recent measurements of the luminosity of the quiet Sun

shear thickening as a precursor to a rigidity transition and give a complete
theory of the viscosity in terms of a universal crossover scaling function from
the frictionless jamming point to a rigidity transition associated with
friction, anisotropy, and shear. Strikingly, we find experimentally that for
two different systems -- cornstarch in glycerol and silica spheres in glycerol
-- the viscosity can be collapsed onto a single universal curve over a wide
range of stresses and volume fractions. The collapse reveals two separate
scaling regimes, due to a crossover between frictionless isotropic jamming and
frictional shear jamming, with different critical exponents. The
material-specific behaviour due to the microscale particle interactions is
incorporated into a scaling variable governing the proximity to shear jamming
that depends on both stress and volume fraction. This reformulation opens the
door to importing the vast theoretical machinery developed to understand
equilibrium critical phenomena to elucidate fundamental physical aspects of the

that a new hydrodynamic instability can occur in a neutron star in a binary
neutron star system triggered by the nonlinear coupling of the companion's
tidal field to pairs of p-modes and g-modes in it as the binary inspirals
toward merger. This ""PG"" instability may be significant since it can influence
the binary's inspiral phase by extracting orbital energy, thereby potentially
causing large deviations in their gravitational waveforms from those predicted
by theoretical models that do not account for it. This can result in incorrect
parameter estimation, at best, or mergers going undetected, at worst, owing to
the use of deficient waveform models. On the other hand, better modeling of
this instability and its effect on binary orbits can unravel a new phenomenon
and shed light on stellar instabilities, via gravitational wave observations.
So far, all mode-tide coupling instability studies have been formulated in
Newtonian perturbation theory. Neutron stars are compact objects, so
relativistic corrections might be important. We present and test a new code to
calculate the relativistic eigenmodes of nonrotating relativistic stars. We use
these relativistic tide and neutron star eigenmodes to compute the mode-tide
coupling strength (MTCS) for a few selected equations of state. The MTCS thus
calculated can be at most tens of percent different from its purely Newtonian
value, but we confirm the dependencies on orbital separation and equation of

very sensitive to the neutron star crust region, demonstrating the importance
of treating this region accurately.

The measure is constructed via a regularisation procedure, in which loops are
killed at a fix rate, allowing us to make use of the Brownian multiplicative
chaos measures previously considered in [BBK94, AHS20, Jeg20a], or via a
discrete loop soup approximation. At the critical intensity $\theta = 1/2$, it
is shown that this measure coincides with the hyperbolic cosine of the Gaussian
free field, which is closely related to Liouville measure. This allows us to
draw several conclusions which elucidate connections between Brownian
multiplicative chaos, Gaussian free field and Liouville measure. For instance,
it is shown that Liouville-typical points are of infinite loop multiplicity,
with the relative contribution of each loop to the overall thickness of the
point being described by the Poisson--Dirichlet distribution with parameter
$\theta = 1/2$. Conversely, the Brownian chaos associated to each loop
describes its microscopic contribution to Liouville measure. Along the way, our
proof reveals a surprising exact integrability of the multiplicative chaos
associated to a killed Brownian loop soup. We also obtain some estimates on the
discrete and continuous loop soups which may be of independent interest.

approaches equilibration. This is a nontrivial issue since a squeezed bath
field cannot reach equilibration and yet, as this work shows, the system
oscillator indeed can, which is a necessary condition for FDRs. We discuss
three different settings: A) The bath field essentially remains in a squeezed
thermal state throughout, whose squeeze parameter is a mode- and
time-independent constant. This situation is often encountered in quantum
optics and quantum thermodynamics. B) The field is initially in a thermal
state, but subjected to a parametric process leading to mode- and
time-dependent squeezing. This scenario is met in cosmology and dynamical
Casimir effect. The squeezing in the bath in both types of processes will
affect the oscillator's nonequilibrium evolution. We show that at late times it
approaches equilibration, which warrants the existence of an FDR. The trait of
squeezing is marked by the oscillator's effective equilibrium temperature, and
the factor in the FDR is only related to the stationary component of bath's
noise kernel. Setting C) is more subtle: A finite system-bath coupling strength
can set the oscillator in a squeezed state even the bath field is stationary
and does not engage in any parametric process. The squeezing of the system in
this case is in general time-dependent but becomes constant when the internal
dynamics is fully relaxed. We begin with comments on the broad range of
physical processes involving squeezed thermal baths and end with some remarks
on the significance of FDRs in capturing the essence of quantum backreaction in
nonequilibrium systems.

avenue of discovery for new physics. Its information content encodes multiple
eras in the early Universe's history, corresponding to many orders of magnitude
in frequency and physical scale to be measured today. By numerically solving
for the GW transfer functions we provide simple yet accurate formulas
describing the average power of the large-scale energy spectrum of the GWB for
arbitrary primordial tensor power spectra. In doing so we can pedagogically
explain and clarify previous GWB literature, highlight the important
cosmological parameters of various GWB features, and reveal multiple ways in
which cancelling conceptual errors can give deceptively accurate results. The
scales considered here are particularly important for CMB probes of the GWB,
via $B$-modes and spectral distortions. In particular, we carefully study the
effects of both neutrino damping, and the precise nature of the transition
between the radiation-dominated (RD) and matter-dominated (MD) eras. A
byproduct of numerically solving the problem is the ability to study the
robustness of common approximations in the literature. Specifically, we show
that a numerical treatment is especially important around the RD--MD
transition, and for a brief moment of history where neutrino damping occurs
during MD. In passing we also discuss the effects of late acceleration caused
by dark energy -- showing that this can be neglected in most practical GWB
applications -- and the effects of changing relativistic degrees of freedom on
the GWB at very small-scales.

transition metal substitutions are considered. Since many previous studies have
focused on the CeFe11Ti compound, this particular compound became the starting
point of our considerations and we gave it special attention. We first
determined the optimal symmetry of the simplest CeFe11Ti structure model. We
then observed that the calculated magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE)
correlates with the magnetic moment, which in turn strongly depends on the
choice of the exchange-correlation potential. MAE, magnetic moments, and
magnetic hardness were determined for all compositions considered. Moreover,
the calculated dependence of the MAE on the spin magnetic moment allowed us to
predict the upper limits of the MAE. We also showed that it does not depend on
the choice of the exchange-correlation potential form. The economically
justifiable compositions with the highest magnetic hardness values are CeFe11W,
CeFe10W2, CeFe11Mn, CeFe10Mn2, CeFe11Mo, CeFe10Mo2, and CeFe10Nb2. However,
calculations suggest that, like CeFe12, these compounds are not chemically
stable and could require additional treatments to stabilize the composition.
Further alloying of the selected compositions with elements embedded in
interstitial positions confirms the positive effect of such dopants on hard
magnetic properties. Subsequent calculations performed for comparison for
selected isostructural La-based compounds lead to similar MAE results as for
Ce-based compounds, suggesting a secondary effect of 4f electrons. Calculations
were performed using the full-potential local-orbital electronic structure code
FPLO18, whose unique fully relativistic implementation of the fixed spin moment
method allowed us to calculate the MAE dependence of the magnetic moment.

Internet of Things technology, which can monitor the environmental information
in real time and employ the information to contribute to intelligent
decision-making. In the process, anomaly detection for wireless sensor data
plays an important role. However, traditional anomaly detection algorithms
originally designed for anomaly detection in static data have not properly
considered the inherent characteristics of data stream produced by wireless
sensor such as infiniteness, correlations and concept drift, which may pose a
considerable challenge on anomaly detection based on data stream, and lead to
low detection accuracy and efficiency. First, data stream usually generates
quickly which means that it is infinite and enormous, so any traditional
off-line anomaly detection algorithm that attempts to store the whole dataset
or to scan the dataset multiple times for anomaly detection will run out of
memory space. Second, there exist correlations among different data streams,
which traditional algorithms hardly consider. Third, the underlying data
generation process or data distribution may change over time. Thus, traditional
anomaly detection algorithms with no model update will lose their effects.
Considering these issues, a novel method (called DLSHiForest) on basis of
Locality-Sensitive Hashing and time window technique in this paper is proposed
to solve these problems while achieving accurate and efficient detection.
Comprehensive experiments are executed using real-world agricultural greenhouse
dataset to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. Experimental results
show that our proposal is practicable in addressing challenges of traditional
anomaly detection while ensuring accuracy and efficiency.

  We rectify this and prove such a classification using a combination of

  Along the way, we prove the existence of projective coarse moduli spaces of

$\tau,\sigma$, the two moduli spaces $M_\tau(\mathbf{v})$ and
$M_\sigma(\mathbf{v})$ of objects of Chern character $\mathbf{v}$ that are
semistable with respect to $\tau$ (resp. $\sigma$) are birational.

the technologies that enable the new 5G services is the Multi-access Edge

and storage capabilities that are deployed at the edge of the network, i.e.,
close to the end users. MEC reduces latency and enables contextual information
and real-time awareness of the local environment. MEC also allows cloud
offloading and the reduction of traffic congestion. Performance is not the only
requirement that the new 5G services have. New mission-critical applications
also require high security and dependability. These three aspects (security,
dependability, and performance) are rarely addressed together. This survey
fills this gap and presents 5G MEC by addressing all these three aspects.
First, we overview the background knowledge on MEC by referring to the current
standardization efforts. Second, we individually present each aspect by
introducing the related taxonomy (important for the not expert on the aspect),
the state of the art, and the challenges on 5G MEC. Finally, we discuss the
challenges of jointly addressing the three aspects.

learning, however, are not well understood, and as a result, current AI systems
do not leverage language as a means for cultural knowledge transmission. Here,
we take a first step towards reverse-engineering cultural learning through
language. We developed a suite of complex tasks in the form of minimalist-style
video games, which we deployed in an iterated learning paradigm. Human
participants were limited to only two attempts (two lives) to beat each game
and were allowed to write a message to a future participant who read the
message before playing. Knowledge accumulated gradually across generations,
allowing later generations to advance further in the games and perform more
efficient actions. Multigenerational learning followed a strikingly similar
trajectory to individuals learning alone with an unlimited number of lives.
Successive generations of learners were able to succeed by expressing distinct
types of knowledge in natural language: the dynamics of the environment,
valuable goals, dangerous risks, and strategies for success. The video game
paradigm we pioneer here is thus a rich test bed for developing AI systems
capable of acquiring and transmitting cultural knowledge.

superlattice, have received enormous interests for their potential applications

them by using external stimuli is prerequisite. Here, we study the dynamics of
individual polar skyrmion bubbles at the nanoscale by using in situ biasing in
a scanning transmission electron microscope. The reversible electric
field-driven phase transition between topological and trivial polar states are
demonstrated. We create, erase and monitor the shrinkage and expansion of
individual polar skyrmions. We find that their transition behaviors are
substantially different from that of magnetic analogue. The underlying
mechanism is discussed by combing with the phase-field simulations. The
controllable manipulation of nanoscale polar skyrmions allows us to tune the
dielectric permittivity at atomic scale and detailed knowledge of their phase
transition behaviors provides fundamentals for their applications in

biodiversity losses that may take long time to manage and restore. Effective
control of epidemic spreading in the wild is a problem of paramount importance,

Understanding the mechanisms that hinder pathogen's propagation is, therefore,
crucial. Usual modelization approaches in epidemic spreading are based in
compartmentalized models, without keeping track of pathogen's concentrations
during spreading. In this contribution we present and fully analyze a dynamical
model for plant epidemic spreading based on pathogen's abundances. The model,
which is defined on top of network substrates, is amenable to a deep
mathematical analysis in the absence of a limit in the amount of pathogen a
plant can tolerate before dying. In the presence of such death threshold, we
observe that the fraction of dead plants peaks at intermediate values of

discuss the implications of our results as mechanisms to halt infection

A*), is the subject of intensive study as it provides a close-up view of an
accreting supermassive black hole. Sgr A* provides us with a prototype of a
low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN), but interstellar scattering and
the resolution limits of our instruments have limited our understanding of the
emission sites in its inner accretion flow. The temporal variability of Sgr A*
can help us understand whether we see a plasma outflow or inflow in the region
close to the black hole. In this work, we look at a comprehensive set of
multi-epoch data recorded with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to
understand the persistence of the time lag relations that have been found in
previous radio observations of Sgr A*. We analyse 8 epochs of data, observed in
Spring 2015, each of which has a frequency coverage from 18 to 48 GHz. We
cross-correlate the calibrated light curves across twelve frequency subbands.
We also generate synthetic data with the appropriate variability
characteristics and use it to study the detectability of time lag relations in
data with this sampling structure. We find that the variability amplitude
increases with frequency. We see positive time lag slopes across all subbands
in five out of eight epochs, with the largest slopes in the cases where a clear
extremum in flux density is present. Three epochs show lag slopes close to
zero. With the synthetic data analysis we show that these results are explained
by a persistent lag relation of $\sim$40 min/cm that covers the bulk of the
variability, with at most 2 percent of the total flux density in an
uncorrelated variability component. Together with the size-frequency relation
and inclination constraints this indicates an outflow velocity with $\gamma
\beta$ = 1.5, consistent with predictions of jet models for Sgr A*.

fundamentally hard: unlike words in natural language, most function names occur
only once. In this paper, we address this problem by introducing eXtreme
Function Labeling (XFL), an extreme multi-label learning approach to selecting
appropriate labels for binary functions. XFL splits function names into tokens,
treating each as an informative label akin to the problem of tagging texts in
natural language. We relate the semantics of binary code to labels through
DEXTER, a novel function embedding that combines static analysis-based features
with local context from the call graph and global context from the entire
binary. We demonstrate that XFL/DEXTER outperforms the state of the art in
function labeling on a dataset of 10,047 binaries from the Debian project,
achieving a precision of 83.5%. We also study combinations of XFL with
alternative binary embeddings from the literature and show that DEXTER
consistently performs best for this task. As a result, we demonstrate that
binary function labeling can be effectively phrased in terms of multi-label
learning, and that binary function embeddings benefit from including explicit

these limitations can be overcome through the use of convolutional neural

histogram data rather than point clouds alone. Alternatively, a combination of
point cloud and active intensity data may be used as input, for a similar level
of performance. In either case, the GPU-accelerated processing time is less
than 1 ms per frame, leading to an overall latency (image acquisition plus
processing) in the millisecond range, making the results relevant for
safety-critical computer vision applications which would benefit from faster

the world and interact with the environment, which can be beneficial for the
analysis of human behaviour. The research in egocentric video analysis is
developing rapidly thanks to the increasing availability of wearable devices
and the opportunities offered by new large-scale egocentric datasets. As
computer vision techniques continue to develop at an increasing pace, the tasks
related to the prediction of future are starting to evolve from the need of
understanding the present. Predicting future human activities, trajectories and
interactions with objects is crucial in applications such as human-robot
interaction, assistive wearable technologies for both industrial and daily
living scenarios, entertainment and virtual or augmented reality. This survey
summarises the evolution of studies in the context of future prediction from
egocentric vision making an overview of applications, devices, existing
problems, commonly used datasets, models and input modalities. Our analysis
highlights that methods for future prediction from egocentric vision can have a
significant impact in a range of applications and that further research efforts
should be devoted to the standardisation of tasks and the proposal of datasets
considering real-world scenarios such as the ones with an industrial vocation.

is investigated. First, it is shown that this task can be solved within the
general framework of active sequential detection. Using this approach, the
optimal sequential detector and the corresponding quantizer are characterized
and their properties are briefly discussed. In particular, it is shown that
designing optimal quantization rules requires solving a nonconvex optimization
problem, which can lead to issues in terms of computational complexity and
numerical stability. Motivated by these difficulties, two performance bounds
are proposed that are easier to evaluate than the true performance measures and
are potentially tighter than the bounds currently available in the literature.
The usefulness of the bounds and the properties of the optimal quantization
rules are illustrated with two numerical examples.

tungsten in WSe2, which results in p-type doping via the introduction of
discrete defect levels that lie close to the valence band maxima. The p-type

will include inconsistent image features from invisible views, which interfere

visibility of 3D points to input views within our NeuRay representation. This
visibility enables the radiance field construction to focus on visible image

novel consistency loss is proposed to refine the visibility in NeuRay when
finetuning on a specific scene. Experiments demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the novel view synthesis task when
generalizing to unseen scenes and outperforms per-scene optimization methods

in the word sequence and the syntactic features in the parse tree. Though
effective, the lexical features extracted from the successive word sequence may
introduce some noise that has little or no meaningful content. Meanwhile, the
syntactic features are usually encoded via graph convolutional networks which
have restricted receptive field. To address the above limitations, we propose a
multi-scale feature and metric learning framework for relation extraction.
Specifically, we first develop a multi-scale convolutional neural network to
aggregate the non-successive mainstays in the lexical sequence. We also design
a multi-scale graph convolutional network which can increase the receptive
field towards specific syntactic roles. Moreover, we present a multi-scale
metric learning paradigm to exploit both the feature-level relation between
lexical and syntactic features and the sample-level relation between instances
with the same or different classes. We conduct extensive experiments on three

quantumness of a multiparameter quantum statistical model. AI is a recently
introduced measure which quantifies the difference between the Holevo and the
SLD scalar bounds, and can be evaluated using only the symmetric logarithmic
derivative (SLD) operators of the model. At first, we evaluate analytically the
AI of the most general quantum statistical models involving two-level (qubit)
and single-mode Gaussian continuous-variable quantum systems, and prove that AI
is a simple monotonous function of the state purity. Then, we numerically
investigate the same problem for qudits ($d$-dimensional quantum systems, with
$2 < d \leq 4$), showing that, while in general AI is not in general a function
of purity, we have enough numerical evidence to conclude that the maximum
amount of AI is attainable only for quantum statistical models characterized by
a purity larger than $\mu_{\sf min} = 1/(d-1)$. In addition, by parametrizing
qudit states as thermal (Gibbs) states, numerical results suggest that, once
the spectrum of the Hamiltonian is fixed, the AI measure is in one-to-one
correspondence with the fictitious temperature parameter $\beta$ characterizing
the family of density operators. Finally, by studying in detail the definition
and properties of the AI measure we find that: i) given a quantum statistical
model, one can readily identify the maximum number of asymptotically
compatibile parameters; ii) the AI of a quantum statistical model bounds from
above the AI of any sub-model that can be defined by fixing one or more of the
original unknown parameters (or functions thereof), leading to possibly useful
bounds on the AI of models involving noisy quantum dynamics.

learning for blind image quality assessment (BIQA). The primary challenge is to
combat catastrophic forgetting of previously-seen IQA datasets (i.e., tasks).
In this paper, we present a simple yet effective continual learning method for
BIQA with improved quality prediction accuracy, plasticity-stability trade-off,
and task-order/-length robustness. The key step in our approach is to freeze
all convolution filters of a pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) for an
explicit promise of stability, and learn task-specific normalization parameters
for plasticity. We assign each new task a prediction head, and load the
corresponding normalization parameters to produce a quality score. The final
quality estimate is computed by a weighted summation of predictions from all
heads with a lightweight K-means gating mechanism, without leveraging the
test-time oracle. Extensive experiments on six IQA datasets demonstrate the
advantages of the proposed method in comparison to previous training techniques
for BIQA.

dense breast cancer. Clinically, doctors have to manually write the screening
report which is time-consuming and laborious, and it is easy to miss and
miswrite. Aim: We proposed a new pipeline to automatically generate AI breast
ultrasound screening reports based on ultrasound images, aiming to assist
doctors in improving the efficiency of clinical screening and reducing
repetitive report writing. Methods: AI was used to efficiently generate
personalized breast ultrasound screening preliminary reports, especially for
benign and normal cases which account for the majority. Based on the
preliminary AI report, doctors then make simple adjustments or corrections to
quickly generate the final report. The approach has been trained and tested
using a database of 4809 breast tumor instances. Results: Experimental results
indicate that this pipeline improves doctors' work efficiency by up to 90%,
which greatly reduces repetitive work. Conclusion: Personalized report
generation is more widely recognized by doctors in clinical practice compared
with non-intelligent reports based on fixed templates or containing options to
fill in the blanks.

learning. In order to avoid the number representation issue and reduce the
search space of feasible solutions, existing works striving for MWP solving
usually replace real numbers with symbolic placeholders to focus on logic
reasoning. However, different from common symbolic reasoning tasks like program
synthesis and knowledge graph reasoning, MWP solving has extra requirements in
numerical reasoning. In other words, instead of the number value itself, it is
the reusable numerical property that matters more in numerical reasoning.
Therefore, we argue that injecting numerical properties into symbolic
placeholders with contextualized representation learning schema can provide a
way out of the dilemma in the number representation issue here. In this work,
we introduce this idea to the popular pre-training language model (PLM)
techniques and build MWP-BERT, an effective contextual number representation
PLM. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our MWP-BERT on MWP solving and
several MWP-specific understanding tasks on both English and Chinese

outermost stable circular orbits. We show that the impact of the perfect fluid
dark matter shrinks the region where circular orbits can exist as the values of
both innermost and outermost stable circular orbits decrease. We find that for
specific lower and upper values of dark matter parameter there exist double
matching values for inner and outermost stable circular orbits. It turns out
that the gravitational attraction due to the dark matter contribution dominates
over cosmological repulsion. This gives rise to a remarkable result in the
Schwarzschild-dS black hole surrounded by dark matter field in contrast to the
Schwarzschild-dS metric. Finally, we study epicyclic motion and its frequencies
with their applications to twin peak quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) for
various models. We find corresponding values of the black hole parameters which

balance theory that relates the stochastic
susceptible-alert-infected-susceptible epidemic dynamical model with the
structural balance of SSNs to substantiate the trade-off between social tension
and epidemic spread. Moreover, the role of hostile social links in the
formation of disjoint friendly clusters of alerted and infected users is
analyzed. Using three real-world SSN datasets, we further present a
time-efficient algorithm to expedite the energy computation in our Monte-Carlo

reflection arrangements. The goal of this work is to show that Koszul duality
provides a nice interplay between the dual braid monoid and the cluster complex
introduced by Fomin and Zelevinsky. Firstly, we prove koszulity of the dual
braid monoid algebra, by building explicitly the minimal free resolution of the
ground field. This is done explicitly using some chains complexes defined in
terms of the positive part of the cluster complex. Secondly, we derive various
properties of the quadratic dual algebra. We show that it is naturally graded
by the noncrossing partition lattice. We get an explicit basis, naturally
indexed by positive faces of the cluster complex. Moreover, we find the
structure constants via a geometric rule in terms of the cluster fan.
Eventually, we realize this dual algebra as a quotient of a Nichols algebra.
This latter fact makes a connection with results of Zhang, who used the same
algebra to compute the homology of Milnor fibers of reflection arrangements.

$SU(3)_{w}^{}$ gauge multiplet with five-dimensional Lorentz symmetry relaxed.
In this $SU(3)_{w}^{}$ model with Lorentz violation, the deviation of the
resulting triple Higgs boson coupling from its SM prediction is shown to be
less than $10\%$ when the compactification scale is larger than the
experimental lower bound, which is around 5 TeV. Next, we examine the Higgs
potential in other similar gauge-Higgs unification models with a flat extra
dimension. It is pointed out that even in such models the shape of the Higgs
potential around the vacuum quickly approaches that of the minimal Higgs
potential with one Higgs doublet as the compactification scale of the extra

at planned lepton colliders will necessitate significant extensions of such
gauge-Higgs unification models.

hazards. Most movement exhibits directional bias that is related to
environmental features (taxis), such as the location of food patches,
predators, ocean currents, or wind. Numerous behaviours with directional bias
can be characterized by maintaining orientation at an angle relative to the
environmental stimuli (menotaxis), including navigation relative to sunlight or
magnetic fields and energy-conserving flight across wind. However, no
statistical methods exist to flexibly classify and characterise such
directional bias. 2. We propose a biased correlated random walk model that can
identify menotactic behaviours by predicting turning angle as a trade-off
between directional persistence and directional bias relative to environmental
stimuli without making a priori assumptions about the angle of bias. We apply
the model within the framework of a multi-state hidden Markov model (HMM) and
describe methods to remedy information loss associated with coarse
environmental data to improve the classification and parameterization of
directional bias. 3. Using simulation studies, we illustrate how our method
more accurately classifies behavioural states compared to conventional
correlated random walk HMMs that do not incorporate directional bias. We
illustrate the application of these methods by identifying cross wind olfactory
foraging and drifting behaviour mediated by wind-driven sea ice drift in polar
bears (Ursus maritimus) from movement data collected by satellite telemetry. 4.
The extensions we propose can be readily applied to movement data to identify
and characterize behaviours with directional bias toward any angle, and open up
new avenues to investigate more mechanistic relationships between animal
movement and the environment.

solved by introducing appropriate potential functions. The solid is assumed to
exhibit a particular material anisotropy, i.e. spherical isotropy, which
includes material isotropy as a special case. The equations governing the
anisotropic solid are solved in spherical coordinates using the state-space
formalism, which finally establishes two separate transfer relations
correlating the state vectors at the innermost surface with those at the
outermost surface of the multilayered hollow sphere. By imposing the continuity
conditions at the fluid-solid interface, two separate analytical characteristic
equations are derived, which characterize two independent classes of vibration.
Numerical examples are finally conducted to validate the theoretical derivation
as well as to investigate the effects of various factors, including fluid
viscosity and compressibility, fluid viscoelasticity, solid anisotropy and
surface effect, as well as solid intrinsic damping, on the vibration
characteristics of the submerged hollow sphere. Particularly, our theoretically
predicted vibration frequencies and quality factors of gold nanospheres with
intrinsic damping immersed in water agree exceptionally well with the available
experimentally measured results. The reported analytical solution is truly and
fully three-dimensional, covering from the purely radial breathing mode to
torsional mode to any general spheroidal mode.

problem. This paper presents a method for recovering dually the ice thickness
and the basal slip using only surface elevation and speed measurements. The
unidirectional shallow ice approximation is first implemented to model steady
state ice flow for given bedrock and basal slip profiles. This surface is then
taken as synthetic observed data. An augmented Lagrangian algorithm is then
used to find the diffusion coefficient which gives the best fit to
observations. Combining this recovered diffusion with observed surface
velocity, a simple Newton's method is used to recover both the ice thickness

that it should be possible to recover both of these parameters in

important but computationally challenging topic. In this article, an efficient
data-driven statistically accurate reduced-order modeling algorithm is
developed that significantly accelerates the computational efficiency of
Lagrangian data assimilation. The algorithm starts with a Fourier transform of
the high-dimensional flow field, which is followed by an effective model
reduction that retains only a small subset of the Fourier coefficients
corresponding to the energetic modes. Then a linear stochastic model is
developed to approximate the nonlinear dynamics of each Fourier coefficient.
Effective additive and multiplicative noise processes are incorporated to
characterize the modes that exhibit Gaussian and non-Gaussian statistics,
respectively. All the parameters in the reduced order system, including the
multiplicative noise coefficients, are determined systematically via closed
analytic formulae. These linear stochastic models succeed in forecasting the
uncertainty and facilitate an extremely rapid data assimilation scheme. The new
Lagrangian data assimilation is then applied to observations of sea ice floe
trajectories that are driven by atmospheric winds and turbulent ocean currents.
It is shown that observing only about $30$ non-interacting floes in a
$200$km$\times200$km domain is sufficient to recover the key multi-scale
features of the ocean currents. The additional observations of the floe angular
displacements are found to be suitable supplements to the center-of-mass
positions for improving the data assimilation skill. In addition, the observed
large and small floes are more useful in recovering the large- and small-scale
features of the ocean, respectively. The Fourier domain data assimilation also
succeeds in recovering the ocean features in the areas where cloud cover
obscures the observations.

uses the estimated WCET to schedule each task of these systems, and failure may
lead to catastrophic events. It is thus imperative to build provably reliable
systems. WCET is available to us in the last stage of systems development when
the hardware is available and the application code is compiled on it. Different
methodologies measure the WCET, but none of them give early insights on WCET,
which is crucial for system development. If the system designers overestimate
WCET in the early stage, then it would lead to the overqualified system, which
will increase the cost of the final product, and if they underestimate WCET in
the early stage, then it would lead to financial loss as the system would not
perform as expected. This paper estimates early WCET using Deep Neural Networks
as an approximate predictor model for hardware architecture and compiler. This
model predicts the WCET based on the source code without compiling and running
on the hardware architecture. Our WCET prediction model is created using the
Pytorch framework. The resulting WCET is too erroneous to be used as an upper

the overall computational cost at fixed numerical accuracy compared to the
so-called direct numerical simulations. In the present work, two different
multiscale modeling approaches are presented for the analysis of
microstructural instability-induced failure in locally periodic

involving large deformations. The first approach, which is of a semi-concurrent
kind, consists in the on-the-fly derivation of the macroscopic constitutive
response of the composite structure together with its microscopic stability
properties through a two-way computational homogenization scheme. The latter
one is a novel hybrid hierarchical-concurrent multiscale approach relying on a
two-level domain decomposition scheme used in conjunction with a nonlinear
homogenization scheme performed at the preprocessing stage. Both multiscale
approaches have been suitably validated through comparisons with reference
direct numerical simulations, by which the ability of the latter approach in

a pre-screening classification network prior to the segmentation network.
Experimental results demonstrate that such a classifier, minimising frame
classification errors, was able to directly impact the number of false positive

classifier-selected frames, that would be segmented, remains comparable to or
better than those from standalone segmentation networks. Interestingly, the
efficacy of the pre-screening classifier was affected by the sampling methods

solids is presented. Damage is captured by means of a phase field model that
considers both the elastic and plastic works as driving forces for fracture.
Material deformation is characterised by a mechanism-based strain gradient
constitutive model. This non-local plastic-damage formulation is numerically
implemented and used to simulate fracture in several paradigmatic boundary
value problems. The case studies aim at shedding light into the role of the
plastic and fracture length scales. It is found that the role of plastic strain
gradients is two-fold. When dealing with sharp defects like cracks, plastic
strain gradients elevate local stresses and facilitate fracture. However, in
the presence of non-sharp defects failure is driven by the localisation of
plastic flow, which is delayed due to the additional work hardening introduced
by plastic strain gradients.

  substantial text overlap with arXiv:2010.03741",,,,"math.GN math.OA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A $k_\omega$-space $X$ is a Hausdorff quotient of a locally compact,
$\sigma$-compact Hausdorff space. A theorem of Morita's describes the structure
of $X$ when the quotient map is closed, but in 2010 a question of
Arkhangel'skii's highlighted the lack of a corresponding theorem for non-closed
quotient maps (even from subsets of $\mathbb{R}^n$). Arkhangel'skii's specific
question had in fact been answered by Siwiec in 1976, but a general structure
theorem for $k_\omega$-spaces is still lacking. We introduce pure quotient
maps, extend Morita's theorem to these, and use Fell's topology to show that
every quotient map can be 'purified' (and thus every $k_\omega$-space is the
image of a pure quotient map). This clarifies the structure of arbitrary
$k_\omega$-spaces and gives a fuller answer to Arkhangel'skii's question.

  Fully-Reflective Volumetric Metasurfaces","8 pages, 5 figures",,,,"physics.app-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While metasurfaces (MSs) are constructed from deeply-subwavelength unit
cells, they are generally electrically large and full-wave simulations of the
complete structure are computationally expensive. Thus, to reduce this high
computational cost, non-uniform MSs can be modelled as zero-thickness
boundaries, with sheets of electric and magnetic polarizations related to the
fields by surface susceptibilities and the generalized sheet transition
conditions (GSTCs). While these two-sided boundary conditions have been
extensively studied for single sheets of resonant particles, it has not been
shown if they can correctly model structures where the two sides are
electrically isolated, such as a fully-reflective surface. In particular, we
consider in this work whether the fields scattered from a fully reflective
metasurface can be correctly predicted for arbitrary field illuminations, with
the source placed on either side of the surface. In the process, we also show
the mapping of a PEC sheet with a dielectric cover layer to bi-anisotropic
susceptibilities. Finally, we demonstrate the use of the susceptibilities as
compact models for use in various simulation techniques, with an illustrative
example of a parabolic reflector, for which the scattered fields are correctly
computed using a integral equation (IE) based solver.

been an unavoidable problem in GR. In recent studies researchers have tried to
deal with this issue using modified gravity theories where the WH geometry is
explained by the extra curvature terms and NEC's are not violated signifying
the standard matter in the WH geometry. In the present article we are trying to
find the solutions of traversable wormholes with normal matter in the throat
within the framework of symmetric teleparallel gravity $f(Q)$ where $Q$ is the
non metricity scalar which defines the gravitational interaction. We will
examine the wormhole geometries for three forms of function $f(Q)$. First is
the linear form $f(Q)=\alpha Q$, second a non -linear form $f(Q)=\alpha Q^2 +
\beta$ and third one a more general quadratic form $f(Q)=\alpha Q^2 + \beta Q +
\gamma$ with $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ being the constants. For all the
three cases the shape function is taken as $b(r) =
{\frac{r_{0}\ln(r+1)}{\ln({r_0}+1)}}$ where $r_0$ is the throat radius. A
special variable redshift function is considered for the discussion. All the
energy conditions are then examined for the existence and the stability of the

verify analysis results, and to communicate information. Their explanation, in
particular with respect to the input attributes, is often difficult. With
linear projects like PCA the axes can still be annotated meaningfully. With
non-linear projections this is no longer possible and alternative strategies
such as attribute-based color coding are required. In this paper, we review
existing augmentation techniques and discuss their limitations. We present the
Non-Linear Embeddings Surveyor (NoLiES) that combines a novel augmentation
strategy for projected data (rangesets) with interactive analysis in a small
multiples setting. Rangesets use a set-based visualization approach for binned
attribute values that enable the user to quickly observe structure and detect
outliers. We detail the link between algebraic topology and rangesets and
demonstrate the utility of NoLiES in case studies with various challenges
(complex attribute value distribution, many attributes, many data points) and a
real-world application to understand latent features of matrix completion in
thermodynamics.

and computation demands. In spite of the higher local computation capability on
visual processing compared with conventional Internet of Things devices, IoVT
devices need to offload partial visual processing tasks to the mobile edge
computing (MEC) server wirelessly due to its larger computation demands.
However, visual processing task offloading is limited by uplink throughput and
computation capability of the MEC server. To break through these limitations, a
novel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) assisted IoVT framework with
multiple MEC servers is proposed, where NOMA is exploited to improve uplink
throughput and MEC servers are co-located with base stations to provide enough
computation capability for offloading. In the proposed framework, the
association strategy, uplink visual data transmission assisted by NOMA and
division of the visual processing tasks as well as computation resource
allocation at the MEC servers are jointly optimized to minimize the total delay
of all visual processing tasks, while meeting the delay requirements of all
IoVT devices. Simulation results demonstrate that significant performance gains
can be achieved by proposed joint optimization with NOMA transmission and
multi-MEC offloading in the heterogeneous IoVT network.
