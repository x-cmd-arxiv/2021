  Product Basis Systems",,,,,"stat.ME stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many modern datasets, from areas such as neuroimaging and geostatistics, come
in the form of a random sample of tensor-valued data which can be understood as
noisy observations of a smooth multidimensional random function. Most of the
traditional techniques from functional data analysis are plagued by the curse
of dimensionality and quickly become intractable as the dimension of the domain
increases. In this paper, we propose a framework for learning continuous
representations from a sample of multidimensional functional data that is
immune to several manifestations of the curse. These representations are
constructed using a set of separable basis functions that are defined to be
optimally adapted to the data. We show that the resulting estimation problem
can be solved efficiently by the tensor decomposition of a carefully defined
reduction transformation of the observed data. Roughness-based regularization
is incorporated using a class of differential operator-based penalties.
Relevant theoretical properties are also established. The advantages of our
method over competing methods are demonstrated in a simulation study. We
conclude with a real data application in neuroimaging.

galaxies (SFGs) in the local universe, including M82, NGC 253, Arp 220 and M33.
The bulk of this emission is thought to be of hadronic origin, arising from the
interactions of cosmic rays (CRs) with the interstellar medium of their host
galaxy. Distant SFGs are presumably also bright in $\gamma$-rays. Although they
would not be resolvable as point sources, distant unresolved SFG populations
contribute $\gamma$-rays to the extra-galactic $\gamma$-ray background (EGB).
Despite the wealth of high-quality all-sky EGB data collected over more than a
decade of operation with the \textit{Fermi}-LAT $\gamma$-ray space telescope,
the exact contribution of SFGs to the EGB remains unsettled. In this study, we
model the $\gamma$-ray emission from SFG populations and demonstrate that such
emission can be characterized by just a small number of physically-motivated
parameters. We further show that source populations would leave anisotropic
signatures in the EGB, which could be used to yield information about the
underlying properties, dynamics and evolution of CR-rich SFGs.

interferometric advanced gravitational wave detectors. Astrophysical models
suggest finite possibility of binary systems with appreciable non-zero
eccentricity in the dense stellar environment like globular clusters and
galactic nuclei. While most of the compact binary measurements have not shown
appreciable eccentricity, constrains on the eccentricity have been placed on
few detected events. With increasing sensitivity of the gravitational wave
detectors, the eccentric binaries are plausible sources in the gravitational
wave window. Nevertheless, the challenges in the waveform modelling for high
values of eccentricity constrain both the search methodologies of eccentric
system as well as parameter estimation of the eccentricity. Waveform
independent approaches are being investigated. In this work, we demonstrate
that a new effective chirp mass $\mathcal{M}_e$ parameter can be defined which
governs the dynamics of the non-spinning eccentric compact binary system. We
obtain the phenomenological model of the same for low to moderate eccentricity
values. One direct implication is its application in the unmodelled searches
and as an another implication, we demonstrate that this model can be used to
constrain the eccentricity of the non-spinning eccentric binaries in the
advanced detector era in the waveform model-independent way.

according to a distant observer? This question is non-trivial because
electromagnetic and gravitational waves, despite being comprised of massless
particles, can develop tails: they travel inside the light cone. To this end, I
attempt to close a gap in the literature by first deriving, strictly within
classical field theory, the real-time electromagnetic dipole and gravitational
quadrupole energy and angular momentum radiation formulas in all relevant
dimensions. The even dimensional case, where massless signals travel strictly
on the null cone, depends on the time derivatives of the dipoles and
quadrupoles solely at retarded time; whereas the odd dimensional ones involve
an integral over their retarded histories. Despite the propagation of light
inside the null cone, however, I argue that a monochromatic light bulb of some
intrinsic duration in odd dimensions remains approximately the same apparent
duration to a distant detector, though the tail effect does produce a phase
shift and adds to the signal several transitory non-oscillatory inverse square
roots in time.

  Supplemental Material","20 pages, 18 figure",,,,"cs.GR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Past work on optimizing fabrication plans given a carpentry design can
provide Pareto-optimal plans trading off between material waste, fabrication
time, precision, and other considerations. However, when developing fabrication
plans, experts rarely restrict to a single design, instead considering families
of design variations, sometimes adjusting designs to simplify fabrication.
Jointly exploring the design and fabrication plan spaces for each design is
intractable using current techniques. We present a new approach to jointly
optimize design and fabrication plans for carpentered objects. To make this
bi-level optimization tractable, we adapt recent work from program synthesis
based on equality graphs (e-graphs), which encode sets of equivalent programs.
Our insight is that subproblems within our bi-level problem share significant
substructures. By representing both designs and fabrication plans in a new bag
of parts(BOP) e-graph, we amortize the cost of optimizing design components
shared among multiple candidates. Even using BOP e-graphs, the optimization
space grows quickly in practice. Hence, we also show how a feedback-guided
search strategy dubbed Iterative Contraction and Expansion on E-graphs (ICEE)
can keep the size of the e-graph manage-able and direct the search toward
promising candidates. We illustrate the advantages of our pipeline through
examples from the carpentry domain.

inspirals, targets for the future space-based gravitational wave detector,
LISA. In the modelling of such systems, a point-particle assumption leads to
problematic singularities which need to be safely removed to solve for the

the mechanical properties of cells. The actin cytoskeleton undergoes
significant reorganization over the course of the cell cycle, when cortical
actin transitions between open patched meshworks, homogeneous distributions,
and aligned bundles. Several types of myosin motor proteins, characterized by
different kinetic parameters, have been involved in this reorganization of
actin filaments. Given the limitations in studying the interactions of actin
with myosin in vivo, we propose stochastic agent-based model simulations and
develop a set of data analysis measures to assess how myosin motor proteins
mediate various actin organizations. In particular, we identify individual
motor parameters, such as motor binding rate and step size, that generate actin
networks with different levels of contractility and different patterns of
myosin motor localization. In simulations where two motor populations with
distinct kinetic parameters interact with the same actin network, we find that
motors may act in a complementary way, by tuning the actin network
organization, or in an antagonistic way, where one motor emerges as dominant.
This modeling and data analysis framework also uncovers parameter regimes where
spatial segregation between motor populations is achieved. By allowing for
changes in kinetic rates during the actin-myosin dynamic simulations, our work
suggests that certain actin-myosin organizations may require additional
regulation beyond mediation by motor proteins in order to reconfigure the
cytoskeleton network on experimentally-observed timescales.

economic and privacy damages, which evinces the need for accurate Network
Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Recent works propose the use of Machine
Learning (ML) techniques for building such systems (e.g., decision trees,
neural networks). However, existing ML-based NIDS are barely robust to common
adversarial attacks, which limits their applicability to real networks. A
fundamental problem of these solutions is that they treat and classify flows
independently. In contrast, in this paper we argue the importance of focusing
on the structural patterns of attacks, by capturing not only the individual
flow features, but also the relations between different flows (e.g., the
source/destination hosts they share). To this end, we use a graph
representation that keeps flow records and their relationships, and propose a
novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) model tailored to process and learn from such
graph-structured information. In our evaluation, we first show that the
proposed GNN model achieves state-of-the-art results in the well-known
CIC-IDS2017 dataset. Moreover, we assess the robustness of our solution under
two common adversarial attacks, that intentionally modify the packet size and
inter-arrival times to avoid detection. The results show that our model is able
to maintain the same level of accuracy as in previous experiments, while
state-of-the-art ML techniques degrade up to 50% their accuracy (F1-score)
under these attacks. This unprecedented level of robustness is mainly induced
by the capability of our GNN model to learn flow patterns of attacks structured

The mixed-valent character of the Co ions up to at least $T=873$ K is verified

that the Co ions at the $M4$ site are much smaller than the others at low

at the remaining sites. The size difference between the Co ions in the $M4$ and
$M2$ sites is continuously reduced upon warming above $\approx 370$ K,
indicating a gradual charge redistribution within the $M4$-$M2$-$M4$ (424)

variance with the average crystal structure obtained with XRD. We conclude that
the oxidation states Co$^{2+}$ and Co$^{3+}$ are instantaneously well defined

the related literature mainly focused on reducing the computational and memory

This assumption results in TML solutions that might become obsolete when the

periodicity or seasonality effect, faults or malfunctioning affecting sensors
or actuators, or changes in the users' behavior), a common situation in

updates (in a passive way) the knowledge base of TML-CD and, at the same time,
employs a Change Detection Test to inspect for changes (in an active way) to
quickly adapt to concept drift by removing the obsolete knowledge. Experimental
results on both image and audio benchmarks show the effectiveness of the

deploying a large model. In this paper, we study the issue of training
self-supervised small models without distillation signals. We first evaluate
the representation spaces of the small models and make two non-negligible
observations: (i) the small models can complete the pretext task without
overfitting despite their limited capacity and (ii) they universally suffer the
problem of over clustering. Then we verify multiple assumptions that are
considered to alleviate the over-clustering phenomenon. Finally, we combine the
validated techniques and improve the baseline performances of five small
architectures with considerable margins, which indicates that training small
self-supervised contrastive models is feasible even without distillation
signals. The code is available at

activity characterizing the preliminary phase of damage accumulation prior to
failure of quasi-brittle solids. We use a minimal but thermodynamically
consistent model of damage growth and localization developed by Berthier et al.
(2017). The approach accounts for both microstructural disorder and non-local
interactions and permits inferring a complete scaling description of the
spatio-temporal structure of failure precursors. By developing a theoretical
model of damage growth in disordered elasto-damageable specimen, we demonstrate
that these scaling relations emerge from the physics of elastic manifolds
driven in disordered media, while the divergence of these quantities close to
failure is reminiscent of the loss of stability of the specimen at the
localization threshold. Our study sorts out a long-standing debate on the
nature of the compressive failure point and the origin of the universal
statistics of the precursors preceding it. Our analysis rules out a
critical-point scenario in which the divergence of the precursor size close to
failure is signature of a second-order phase transition governed by the
microstructural disorder. Instead, we show that while the jerky evolution of
damage prior to failure results from the presence of material disorder, the
latter does not significantly change the nature of the localization process,
which is an instability well described by standard bifurcation theory of
homogeneous systems. Finally, we harness our detailed understanding of the
precursory statistics to design a methodology to estimate the residual lifetime
of a structure from the statistical analysis of precursors. This method
relevant for structural health monitoring is shown to perform rather accurately
on our data.

model, Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), which has previously been found to
outperform pointwise models in predictive accuracy, while also being able to
handle implicit feedback. Specifically, we address two limitations of BPR: (1)
BPR is a black box model that does not explain its outputs, thus limiting the
user's trust in the recommendations, and the analyst's ability to scrutinize a
model's outputs; and (2) BPR is vulnerable to exposure bias due to the data
being Missing Not At Random (MNAR). This exposure bias usually translates into
an unfairness against the least popular items because they risk being
under-exposed by the recommender system. In this work, we first propose a novel
explainable loss function and a corresponding Matrix Factorization-based model
called Explainable Bayesian Personalized Ranking (EBPR) that generates
recommendations along with item-based explanations. Then, we theoretically
quantify additional exposure bias resulting from the explainability, and use it
as a basis to propose an unbiased estimator for the ideal EBPR loss. The result
is a ranking model that aptly captures both debiased and explainable user
preferences. Finally, we perform an empirical study on three real-world

and quantifying conformational dynamics can be challenging by intensity-based
smFRET. Multiparameter fluorescence detection (MFD) addresses this challenge by
simultaneously registering intensities and fluorescence lifetimes. Together,
the mean donor fluorescence lifetime and the fluorescence intensities inform on

process the explosive computation tasks of vehicular user (VU). In the VEC
system, each VU allocates power to process partial tasks through offloading and
the remaining tasks through local execution. During the offloading, each VU
adopts the multi-input multi-out and non-orthogonal multiple access (MIMO-NOMA)
channel to improve the channel spectrum efficiency and capacity. However, the
channel condition is uncertain due to the channel interference among VUs caused
by the MIMO-NOMA channel and the time-varying path-loss caused by the mobility
of each VU. In addition, the task arrival of each VU is stochastic in the real
world. The stochastic task arrival and uncertain channel condition affect
greatly on the power consumption and latency of tasks for each VU. It is
critical to design an optimal power allocation scheme considering the
stochastic task arrival and channel variation to optimize the long-term reward
including the power consumption and latency in the MIMO-NOMA VEC. Different
from the traditional centralized deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based
scheme, this paper constructs a decentralized DRL framework to formulate the

overcome the existing network traffic data shortage in attack analysis, recent
works propose Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for synthetic flow-based

requirement when processing such network data, which suggests to find solutions
where synthetic data can fully replace real data. Because of the
ill-convergence of the GAN training, none of the existing solutions can
generate high-quality fully synthetic data that can totally substitute real
data in the training of IDS ML components. Therefore, they mix real with
synthetic data, which acts only as data augmentation components, leading to
privacy breaches as real data is used. In sharp contrast, in this work we
propose a novel deterministic way to measure the quality of the synthetic data
produced by a GAN both with respect to the real data and to its performance
when used for ML tasks. As a byproduct, we present a heuristic that uses these
metrics for selecting the best performing generator during GAN training,
leading to a stopping criterion. An additional heuristic is proposed to select
the best performing GANs when different types of synthetic data are to be used
in the same ML task. We demonstrate the adequacy of our proposal by generating
synthetic cryptomining attack traffic and normal traffic flow-based data using
an enhanced version of a Wasserstein GAN. We show that the generated synthetic
network traffic can completely replace real data when training a ML-based
cryptomining detector, obtaining similar performance and avoiding privacy
violations, since real data is not used in the training of the ML-based

in connection to classical calculations relevant to gravitational-wave physics.
Amplitude methods and insights are now employed for precision computations of
observables needed for describing the gravitational dynamics of bound massive
objects such as black holes. An important direction is the inclusion of spin
effects needed to accurately describe rotating (Kerr) black holes. Higher-spin
amplitudes introduced by Arkani-Hamed, Huang and Huang at three points have by
now a firm connection to the effective description of Kerr black-hole physics.
The corresponding Compton higher-spin amplitudes remain however an elusive open
problem. Here we draw from results of the higher-spin literature and show that
physical insights can be used to uniquely fix the Compton amplitudes up to spin
5/2, by imposing a constraint on a three-point higher-spin current that is a
necessary condition for the existence of an underlying unitary theory. We give
the unique effective Lagrangians up to spin $5/2$, and show that they reproduce
the previously-known amplitudes. For the multi-graviton amplitudes analogous to
the Compton amplitude, no further corrections to our Lagrangians are expected,
and hence such amplitudes are uniquely predicted. As an essential tool, we
introduce a modified version of the massive spinor-helicity formalism which
allows us to conveniently obtain higher-spin states, propagators and compact
expressions for the amplitudes.

decomposing the total effect of an exposure on an outcome into the effect
through a mediator and the effect through all other pathways. When the mediator
is a biomarker, values can be subject to an assay lower limit. The mediator is
affected by the treatment and is a putative cause of the outcome, so the assay
lower limit presents a compounded problem in mediation analysis. We propose
three approaches to estimate indirect and direct effects with a mediator
subject to an assay limit: 1. extrapolation 2. numerical optimization and
integration of the observed likelihood and 3. the Monte Carlo Expectation
Maximization (MCEM) algorithm. Since the described methods solely rely on the
so-called Mediation Formula, they apply to most approaches to causal mediation
analysis: natural, separable, and organic indirect and direct effects. A
simulation study compares the estimation approaches to imputing with half the
assay limit. Using HIV interruption study data from the AIDS Clinical Trials
Group described in [Li et al. 2016, AIDS; Lok \& Bosch 2021, Epidemiology], we

study how softness in the particle interaction affects the emergent transport

potential with a shape corresponding to a smoothed rectangular barrier. This

are Bayesian neural networks that aim to learn a latent statistical
distribution to encode extensive data sets as lower dimension representations.
We collected 1 600 319 IP decay curves in various regions of Canada, the United
States and Kazakhstan, and compiled them to train a deep VAE. The proposed deep
learning approach is strictly unsupervised and data-driven: it does not require
manual processing or ground truth labeling of IP data. Moreover, our VAE
approach avoids the pitfalls of IP parametrization with the empirical Cole-Cole
and Debye decomposition models, simple power-law models, or other sophisticated
mechanistic models. We demonstrate four applications of VAEs to model and
process IP data: (1) representative synthetic data generation, (2) unsupervised
Bayesian denoising and data uncertainty estimation, (3) quantitative evaluation
of the signal-to-noise ratio, and (4) automated outlier detection. We also
interpret the IP compilation's latent representation and reveal a strong
correlation between its first dimension and the average chargeability of IP
decays. Finally, we experiment with varying VAE latent space dimensions and
demonstrate that a single real-valued scalar parameter contains sufficient
information to encode our extensive IP data compilation. This new finding
suggests that modeling time-domain IP data using mathematical models governed
by more than one free parameter is ambiguous, whereas modeling only the average
chargeability is justified. A pre-trained implementation of our model --
readily applicable to new IP data from any geolocation -- is available as
open-source Python code for the applied geophysics community.

supports both statistical and neural translation models as well as provides
quality estimation to inform users of reliability, two user feedback interfaces
for experts and common users respectively, example inputs to collect human
translations for monolingual data, word alignment visualization, and relevant
terms from the Cherokee-English dictionary. The quantitative evaluation
demonstrates that our backbone translation models achieve state-of-the-art
translation performance and our quality estimation well correlates with both
BLEU and human judgment. By analyzing 216 pieces of expert feedback, we find
that NMT is preferable because it copies less than SMT, and, in general,
current models can translate fragments of the source sentence but make major
mistakes. When we add these 216 expert-corrected parallel texts back into the
training set and retrain models, equal or slightly better performance is
observed, which indicates the potential of human-in-the-loop learning. Our

well-known DCT image denoising algorithm. The latter, stemming from signal
processing, has been well studied over the years. Though very simple, it is
still used in crucial parts of state-of-the-art ""traditional"" denoising

networks (CNN) have outperformed their traditional counterparts, making signal
processing methods less attractive. In this paper, we demonstrate that a DCT
denoiser can be seen as a shallow CNN and thereby its original linear transform
can be tuned through gradient descent in a supervised manner, improving
considerably its performance. This gives birth to a fully interpretable CNN
called DCT2net. To deal with remaining artifacts induced by DCT2net, an
original hybrid solution between DCT and DCT2net is proposed combining the best
that these two methods can offer; DCT2net is selected to process non-stationary
image patches while DCT is optimal for piecewise smooth patches. Experiments on
artificially noisy images demonstrate that two-layer DCT2net provides
comparable results to BM3D and is as fast as DnCNN algorithm composed of more
than a dozen of layers.

stationary axisymmetric black hole solutions in Einstein-aether theory and
study their properties. The key technical challenge is to impose regularity at
the spin-2, 1, and 0 wave mode horizons. Interestingly we find the metric
horizon, and various wave mode horizons, are not Killing horizons, having null
generators to which no linear combination of Killing vectors is tangent, and
which spiral from pole to equator or vice versa. Existing phenomenological
constraints result in two regions of coupling parameters where the theory is
viable and some couplings are large; region I with a large twist coupling and
region II with also a (somewhat) large expansion coupling. Currently these
constraints do not include tests from strong field dynamics, such as
observations of black holes and their mergers. Given the large aether
coupling(s) one might expect such dynamics to deviate significantly from
general relativity, and hence to further constrain the theory. Here we argue
this is not the case, since for these parameter regions solutions exist where
the aether is ""painted"" onto a metric background that is very close to that of
general relativity. This painting for region I is approximately independent of
the large twist coupling, and for region II is also approximately independent
of the large expansion coupling and normal to a maximal foliation of the
spacetime. We support this picture analytically for weak fields, and
numerically for rotating black hole solutions, which closely approximate the
Kerr metric.

radialization is detected in a variety of different setups, it is most
efficient in the cases of high satellite mass, not very steep host density
profiles, and high initial eccentricity. To understand the origin of this

selectively turned off: satellite mass loss, reflex motion and distortion of
the host, etc. We find that all these factors are important for radialization,

replaced with an unperturbed initial profile. The analysis of forces and
torques acting on both galaxies confirms the major role of self-gravity of both
host and satellite in the reduction of orbital angular momentum. The classical
Chandrasekhar dynamical friction formula, which accounts only for the forces

paper, we study the unexplored effect of the bulk velocity of matter on fast
pairwise conversions and demonstrate that depending on the direction and the
magnitude of the bulk velocity, neutrino flavor conversions could be
significantly enhanced or suppressed. The bulk velocity of matter, which is
usually neglected in the context of neutrino oscillations, can reach values of
one-tenth of the speed of light in astrophysical environments. We find that
bulk velocities much smaller than the maximum allowed velocities can
substantially change the neutrino flavor conversion rate. The demonstration of
possible enhancement of neutrino flavor conversion rate due to the bulk
velocity of matter also raises several important issues that are of relevance

presence of macroscopic systoles in systolic geometry. We first prove a no-go
theorem that $\mathbb{Z}_N$ topological order cannot survive on any fractal
embedded in 2D. For fractal lattice models embedded in 3D or higher spatial
dimensions, $\mathbb{Z}_N$ topological order survives if the boundaries of the
interior holes condense only loop or membrane excitations. Moreover, for a
class of models containing only loop or membrane excitations, and are hence
self-correcting on an $n$-dimensional manifold, we prove that topological order
survives on a large class of fractal geometries independent of the type of hole
boundaries. We further construct fault-tolerant logical gates using their
connection to global and higher-form topological symmetries. In particular, we
have discovered a logical CCZ gate corresponding to a global symmetry in a
class of fractal codes embedded in 3D with Hausdorff dimension asymptotically
approaching $D_H=2+\epsilon$ for arbitrarily small $\epsilon$, which hence only
requires a space-overhead $\Omega(d^{2+\epsilon})$ with $d$ being the code
distance. This in turn leads to the surprising discovery of certain exotic
gapped boundaries that only condense the combination of loop excitations and
gapped domain walls. We further obtain logical $\text{C}^{p}\text{Z}$ gates
with $p\le n-1$ on fractal codes embedded in $n$D. In particular, for the
logical $\text{C}^{n-1}\text{Z}$ in the $n^\text{th}$ level of Clifford

to display hydrodynamics: local transport of conserved quantities, governed by
classical partial differential equations like the diffusion equation. I argue
that the emergence of this dissipative long-wavelength dynamics from the
system's unitary microscopic dynamics is controlled by the structure of the
\textit{Liouvillean graph} of the system's Hamiltonian, that is, the graph
induced on Pauli strings by commutation with that Hamiltonian. The Liouvillean
graph decomposes naturally into subgraphs of Pauli strings of constant
diameter, and the coherent dynamics of these subgraphs determines the rate at
which operator weight spreads to long operators. This argument provides a
quantitative theory of the emergence of a dissipative effective dynamics from
unitary microscopic dynamics; it also leads to an effective model with Hilbert
space dimension linear in system size and exponential in the UV cutoff for
diffusion.

demonstrate that the PICKLE method is comparable in accuracy with the standard
maximum a posteriori (MAP) method, but is significantly faster than MAP for
large-scale problems. Both methods use a mesh to discretize the computational
domain. In MAP, the parameters and states are discretized on the mesh;
therefore, the size of the MAP parameter estimation problem directly depends on
the mesh size. In PICKLE, the mesh is used to evaluate the residuals of the
governing equation, while the parameters and states are approximated by the
truncated conditional Karhunen-Lo\'{e}ve expansions with the number of
parameters controlled by the smoothness of the parameter and state fields, and
not by the mesh size. For a considered example, we demonstrate that the
computational cost of PICKLE increases near linearly (as $N_{FV}^{1.15}$) with
the number of grid points $N_{FV}$, while that of MAP increases much faster as
$N_{FV}^{3.28}$. We demonstrated that once trained for one set of Dirichlet

conditions that give rise to a trivial material response in the sense of
rigid-body motions. The second part is concerned with extending the static
homogenization to an evolutionary {\Gamma}- convergence-type result for
rate-independent systems in specific scenarios, that is, under certain
assumptions on the slip systems and suitable regularizations of the energies,
where energetic and dissipative effects decouple in the limit. Interestingly,
when the slip direction is aligned with the layered microstructure, the
limiting system is purely energetic, which can be interpreted as a loss of
dissipation through homogenization.

type geometry, in which to each point of the space-time manifold an arbitrary
point vector field is associated. This Finsler type geometry is assumed to
describe the physical properties of the gravitational field, as well as the
cosmological dynamics. For the Barthel-Randers geometry the connection is given
by the Levi-Civita connection of the associated Riemann metric. The generalized
Friedmann equations in the Barthel-Randers geometry are obtained by considering
that the background Riemannian metric in the Randers line element is of
Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker type. The matter energy balance equation is
derived, and it is interpreted from the point of view of the thermodynamics of
irreversible processes in the presence of particle creation. The cosmological
properties of the model are investigated in detail, and it is shown that the
model admits a de Sitter type solution, and that an effective cosmological
constant can also be generated. Several exact cosmological solutions are also
obtained. A comparison of three specific models with the observational data and
with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is also performed by fitting the observed
values of the Hubble parameter, with the models giving a satisfactory
description of the observations.

Complex (TC) objects are consistent with the formation of the complex via
fragmentation of a larger body, or if the current orbital affinities between
the TC members result from other dynamical processes. To this end, the orbital
similarity through time of comet 2P/Encke, fifty-one Near-Earth Asteroids
(NEAs) and sixteen Taurid fireballs was explored. Clones of each body were
numerically simulated backwards in time, and epochs when significant fractions
of the clones of any two bodies approached each other with both a low Minimum
Orbit Intersection Distance and small relative velocity were identified. Only
twelve pairs of bodies in our sample show such an association in the past 20
000 years, primarily circa 3200 BCE. These include 2P/Encke and NEAs 2004 TG10,
2005 TF50, 2005 UR, 2015 TX24, and several Southern Taurid fireballs. We find
this orbital convergence to be compatible with the fragmentation of a large
parent body five to six thousand years ago, resulting in the separation of
2P/Encke and several NEAs associated with the TC, as well as some larger
meteoroids now recorded in the Taurid stream. However, the influence of purely
dynamical processes may offer an alternative explanation for this orbital
rapprochement without requiring a common origin between these objects. In order
to discriminate between these two hypotheses, future spectral surveys of the TC
asteroids are required.

some success, lack an assessment of data reliability. This leads to unexpected
failures when noisy or otherwise low-quality data is processed by an autonomous

devices that combines a machine learning (ML) state classifier with a data
quality control module. The data quality control module acts as a ""gatekeeper""
system, ensuring that only reliable data are processed by the state classifier.
Lower data quality results in either device recalibration or termination. To
train both ML systems, we enhance the QD simulation by incorporating synthetic
noise typical of QD experiments. We confirm that the inclusion of synthetic
noise in the training of the state classifier significantly improves the
performance, resulting in an accuracy of 95.0(9) % when tested on experimental
data. We then validate the functionality of the data quality control module by
showing that the state classifier performance deteriorates with decreasing data
quality, as expected. Our results establish a robust and flexible ML framework

by the nonlinear rheology commonly used for modelling ice, the enforcement of a

semicoercive. In this work, we consider a mixed formulation of this variational

were best yesterday may be sub-optimal tomorrow; and environmental conditions
that were once taken for granted may soon cease to exist. In this setting, how
people choose behavioral strategies has important consequences for
environmental dynamics. Economic and evolutionary theories make similar
predictions for strategic behavior in a static environment, even though one
approach assumes perfect rationality and the other assumes no cognition
whatsoever; but predictions differ in a dynamic environment. Here we explore a
middle ground between economic rationality and evolutionary myopia. Starting
from a population of myopic agents, we study the emergence of a new type that
forms environmental forecasts when making strategic decisions. We show that
forecasting types can have an advantage in changing environments, even when the
act of forecasting is costly. Forecasting types can invade but not overtake the
population, producing a stable coexistence with myopic types. Moreover,
forecasters provide a public good by reducing the amplitude of environmental
oscillations and increasing mean payoff to forecasting and myopic types alike.
We interpret our results for understanding the evolution of different modes of
decision-making. And we discuss implications for the management of
environmental systems of great societal importance.

trees that we call a lazy tournament. These sets are compatible with the
forgetting maps used to derive the recursion for the multidegrees proven in
2020 by Gillespie, Cavalieri, and Monin.
  The lazy tournament points are easily seen to total $(2n-1)!!=(2n-1)\cdot
(2n-3) \cdots 5 \cdot 3 \cdot 1$, giving a natural proof of the fact that the
total degree of $\Phi_n$ is the odd double factorial. This fact was first
proven using an insertion algorithm on certain parking functions, and we
additionally give a bijection to those parking functions.

$V_{\mathrm{ISS}}\approx (59\pm7) \sqrt{d_{l}/2\,\rm{kpc}}~{\rm km~s}^{-1}$,
higher than Earth's velocity for any screen beyond a lens distance of $d_{l}
\gtrsim 400\,$pc. From the measured scintillation bandwidth, FRB20201124A has
comparatively lower scattering than nearby pulsars, and is underscattered by a
factor of $\sim 30$ or $\sim 1200$ compared to the NE2001 and YMW16 model

scintillation velocity are consistent with a scattering screen more nearby the
Earth at $d_{l} \sim 400\,$pc, rather than at the 2\,kpc spiral arm which
NE2001 predicts to be the dominant source of scattering. With future
measurements, the distance, geometry, and velocity of the scattering screen
could be obtained through modelling of the annual variation in $V_{\rm ISS}$,
or through inter-station time delays or interferometric observations.
Scintillation/scattering measurements of FRBs could help improve Galactic
electron density models, particularly in the Galactic halo or at high Galactic

how to provide a causal model of a Bell experiment. In the face of their
violation, two types of causal models that modify some of these assumptions
have been proposed: (i) those that are parametrically conservative and
structurally radical, such as models where the parameters are conditional
probability distributions (termed 'classical causal models') but where one
posits inter-lab causal influences or superdeterminism, and (ii) those that are
parametrically radical and structurally conservative, such as models where the
labs are taken to be connected only by a common cause but where conditional
probabilities are replaced by conditional density operators (these are termed
'quantum causal models'). We here seek to adjudicate between these alternatives
based on their predictive power. The data from a Bell experiment is divided
into a training set and a test set, and for each causal model, the parameters
that yield the best fit for the training set are estimated and then used to
make predictions about the test set. Our main result is that the structurally
radical classical causal models are disfavoured relative to the structurally
conservative quantum causal model. Their lower predictive power seems to be due
to the fact that, unlike the quantum causal model, they are prone to a certain
type of overfitting wherein statistical fluctuations away from the
no-signalling condition are mistaken for real features. Our technique shows
that it is possible to witness quantumness even in a Bell experiment that does
not close the locality loophole. It also overturns the notion that it is
impossible to experimentally test the plausibility of superdeterminist models
of Bell inequality violations.

Evaluating the total objective function value for disease control models with

this paper, we improve the conventional Bayesian Optimization (BO) approach
from two parts. The existing BO methods optimize the minimizer step for once
time during each acquisition function update process. To find a better solution
for each acquisition function update, we do more local minimization steps to
tune the algorithm. When the model is high dimensions, and the objective
function is complicated, only some update iterations of the acquisition
function may not find the global optimal solution. The IBO algorithm adds a
series of Adam-based steps at the final stage of the algorithm to increase the
solution's accuracy. Comparative simulation experiments using different kernel
functions and acquisition functions have shown that the Improved Bayesian
Optimization algorithm is effective and suitable for handing large-scale and
complex epidemic models under study. The IBO algorithm is then compared with
four other global optimization algorithms on three well-known synthetic test
functions. The effectiveness and robustness of the IBO algorithm are also
demonstrated through some simulation experiments to compare with the Particle
Swarm Optimization algorithm and Random Search algorithm. With its reliable
convergence behaviors and straightforward implementation, the IBO algorithm has
a great potential to solve other complex optimal control problems with high

crossover driven by the instability of the quantum critical point to
hybridization asymmetry or detuning of the level in the dot. We show that the
crossover properties are given by tunneling through an effective single barrier

obtained from thermodynamic Bethe ansatz results in the literature, which were
developed to treat tunneling in a Luttinger liquid. The current-voltage

find mappings onto, first, the two-channel Kondo model and, second, an
effectively noninteracting model from which the nonlinear conductance is found
analytically. A key feature of the general crossover function is that the

Such hidden biases and imbalances can lead to data tyranny and a major
challenge to a data democracy. In this chapter, two essential statistical
elements are resolved: the degree of class imbalance and the complexity of the
concept; solving such issues helps in building the foundations of a data
democracy. Furthermore, statistical measures which are appropriate in these
scenarios are discussed and implemented on a real-life dataset (car insurance

random undersampling, synthetic minority oversampling technique, Tomek link,

repeatedly report ordinal preferences over a set of services to a central
planner. The planner's goal is to elicit agents' true preferences and design a
policy that matches services to agents in order to maximize the expected social
welfare with the added constraint that each matched service can be
\emph{blocked} or unavailable for a number of time periods. Naturally, SBM
models the repeated allocation of reusable services to a set of agents where
each allocated service becomes unavailable for a fixed duration.
  We first consider the offline SBM setting, where the strategic agents are
aware of their true preferences. We measure the performance of any policy by
\emph{distortion}, the worst-case multiplicative approximation guaranteed by
any policy. For the setting with $s$ services, we establish lower bounds of
$\Omega(s)$ and $\Omega(\sqrt{s})$ on the distortions of any deterministic and
randomised mechanisms, respectively. We complement these results by providing
approximately truthful, measured by \emph{incentive ratio}, deterministic and
randomised policies based on random serial dictatorship which match our lower
bounds. Our results show that there is a significant improvement if one
considers the class of randomised policies.
  Finally, we consider the online SBM setting with bandit feedback where each
agent is initially unaware of her true preferences, and the planner must
facilitate each agent in the learning of their preferences through the matching
of services over time. We design an approximately truthful mechanism based on
the Explore-then-Commit paradigm, which achieves logarithmic dynamic
approximate regret.

important applications in multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM). We propose the majorization minimization (MM) method for distributed
PGO ($\mathsf{MM-PGO}$) that applies to a broad class of robust loss kernels.
The $\mathsf{MM-PGO}$ method is guaranteed to converge to first-order critical
points under mild conditions. Furthermore, noting that the $\mathsf{MM-PGO}$
method is reminiscent of proximal methods, we leverage Nesterov's method and
adopt adaptive restarts to accelerate convergence. The resulting accelerated MM
methods for distributed PGO -- both with a master node in the network
($\mathsf{AMM-PGO}^*$) and without ($\mathsf{AMM-PGO}^{\#}$) -- have faster
convergence in contrast to the $\mathsf{AMM-PGO}$ method without sacrificing
theoretical guarantees. In particular, the $\mathsf{AMM-PGO}^{\#}$ method,
which needs no master node and is fully decentralized, features a novel
adaptive restart scheme and has a rate of convergence comparable to that of the
$\mathsf{AMM-PGO}^*$ method using a master node to aggregate information from
all the other nodes. The efficacy of this work is validated through extensive
applications to 2D and 3D SLAM benchmark datasets and comprehensive comparisons
against existing state-of-the-art methods, indicating that our MM methods
converge faster and result in better solutions to distributed PGO.

[Cristiani et al., DOI:10.1137/140962413]. The model assumes that each
individual in the crowd moves in a known domain, aiming at minimizing a given
cost functional. Both the pedestrian dynamics and the cost functional itself
depend on the position of the whole crowd. In addition, pedestrians are assumed
to have predictive abilities, but limited in time, extending only up to
$\theta$ time units into the future, where $\theta\in[0,\infty)$ is a model
parameter. 1) For $\theta=0$ (no predictive abilities), we recover the modeling
assumptions of the Hughes's model, where people take decisions on the basis of
the current position of the crowd only. 2) For $\theta\to\infty$, instead, we
recover the standard mean field game (MFG) setting, where people are able to
forecast the behavior of the others at any future time and take decisions on
the basis of the current and future position of the whole crowd. 3) For
intermediate values of $\theta$ we obtain something different: as in the
Hughes's model, the numerical procedure to solve the problem requires to run an
off-line procedure at any fixed time $t$, which returns the current optimal
velocity field at time $t$ by solving an associated backward-in-time
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation; but, differently from the Hughes's model,
here the procedure involves a prediction of the crowd behavior in the sliding
time window $[t,t+\theta)$, therefore the optimal velocity field is given by
the solution to a forward-backward system which joins a Fokker-Planck equation
with a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation as in the MFG approach. The fact that a
different forward-backward system must be solved at any time $t$ arises new
interesting theoretical questions. Numerical tests will give some clues about
the well-posedness of the problem.

Instead of focusing on explaining a given set of experimental data, a
systematic study aimed at elucidating the roles of intravalley and intervalley
electron-hole (e-h) exchange on the DT spectra is presented. Previous works
have shown that the e-h exchange introduces a linear leading-order term in the

that the presence of this linear dispersion term can reduce the biexciton
binding energy to zero, contrary to the conventional situation of quadratic
dispersion where an arbitrarily weak (well-behaved) attractive interaction
always supports bound state(s). The effects of spin-scattering and the
spin-orbit interaction caused by e-h exchange is also clarified, and the DT
lineshape at the exciton and trion resonance are studied as a function of e-h
exchange strength. In particular, as the exciton lineshape is determined by the
interplay of linear exciton susceptibility and the bound-state two-exciton
resonance in the T-matrix, the lineshape at the trion is similarly determined
by the interplay of the linear trion susceptibility and the bound-state
exciton-trion resonance in the T-matrix.

and provide meaningful information even when there is no visible illumination.
Yet, unlike imagery that represents radiation from the visible continuum,
infrared images are inherently low-resolution due to hardware constraints. The
restoration of thermal images is critical for applications that involve safety,
search and rescue, and military operations. In this paper, we introduce a
system to efficiently reconstruct thermal images. Specifically, we explore how
to effectively attend to contrasting receptive fields (RFs) where increasing
the RFs of a network can be computationally expensive. For this purpose, we
introduce a deep attention to varying receptive fields network (AVRFN). We
supply a gated convolutional layer with higher-order information extracted from
disparate RFs, whereby an RF is parameterized by a dilation rate. In this way,
the dilation rate can be tuned to use fewer parameters thus increasing the
efficacy of AVRFN. Our experimental results show an improvement over the state
of the art when compared against competing thermal image super-resolution
methods.

is observed in many organisms at various scales, but has been studied mostly in
the limits of high or low Reynolds numbers. Motivated by the swimming of brine
shrimp, a mesoscale organism that operates at intermediate Reynolds numbers, we
computationally studied a simple nonreciprocal 2D model that performs
metachronal swimming. Our swimmer is composed of two pairs of paddles beating
with a phase difference that are symmetrically attached to the sides of a flat
body. We numerically solved the Navier-Stokes equations and used the immersed
boundary method to model the interactions between the fluid and swimmer. To
investigate the effect of inertia and geometry, we performed simulations
varying the paddle spacing and the Reynolds numbers in the range $Re = 0.05 -
100$. In all cases, we observed back-and-forth motion during the cycle and a
finite cycle-averaged swim speed at steady state. Interestingly, we found that
the swim speed of the swimmer has nonmonotonic dependence on $Re$, with a
maximum around $Re\approx1$, a flat minimum between $Re=20-30$ and an eventual
increase for $Re>35$. To get more insight into the mechanism behind this
relationship, we first decomposed the swim stroke of the swimmer and each
paddle into power and recovery strokes and characterized the forward and
backward motion. Unlike for reciprocal swimmers, here, for parts of the cycle
there is competition between the two strokes of the paddles - the balance of
which leads to net motion. We then studied the cycle-averaged, as well as,
power-stroke-averaged and recovery-stroke-averaged fluid flows, and related
differences in the fluid field to the nonmonotonic behavior of the swim speed.
Our results suggest the existence of distinct motility mechanisms that develop
as inertia increases within the intermediate-Re range.

sunlight, could be deployed temporarily to shave the peak of global
temperatures. This would use limited deployment to keep global mean
temperatures below a given threshold, buying time for emissions reductions and
negative emissions to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations. However, we suggest
the trade-offs inherent in such scenarios are not widely appreciated. In this
study, we explore general features of such scenarios, using a combination of
simple analytical relationships between emissions and temperatures and
modelling to illustrate the strong trade-off between the duration of
geoengineering deployment and the temperature overshoot that is suppressed by
geoengineering, as well as the scale of negative emissions that are required.
Our results indicate that, unless climate sensitivity is at the high end of
estimates, shaving a substantial peak, say, of 2K to 1.5K, would require at
least a century of deployment of solar geoengineering and large-scale negative
emissions, under a broad range of emissions trajectories. If negative emissions
are not available at the scale of tens of gigatonnes of C02 per year,
substantial peak-shaving will require deployment of geoengineering for multiple
centuries. Our analysis emphasise the importance of factoring in the scale,
feasibility, and cost of the negative emissions required to avoid indefinite
commitment to solar geoengineering.

gateway. This gateway is a centralized element for the management of the
devices that make up an IoT application. In addition, it is essential for the
transmission of information to the Internet, especially when many IoT devices
are not IP-based. This chapter describes a proposed model for an IoT gateway
that allows the exchange of data through different wireless technologies and
forwarding of such data to the Internet.
  The proposed gateway has important advantages such as: supporting for
multiprotocol interconnectivity, the remote configuration of wireless nodes for
sensor and actuators management; a flexible algorithm totranslate the data
obtained by sensors into a uniform format for transmission to a cloud server;
low energy consumption due to efficient data transfer over MQTT protocol.
  In order to demonstrate the usefulness of the developed gateway, a proof of
concept test was implemented. The implemented scenario consists of 2 wireless
nodes responsible for sensing environmental variables and transmitting data to
the gateway node through different communication protocols. The obtained
results show the feasibility for simultaneous data transmission from the remote
wireless nodes to the gateway. Metrics on energy consumption in the devices are
also presented.

status of the body's vital (life-sustaining) functions. BP is difficult to
continuously monitor using a sphygmomanometer (i.e. a blood pressure cuff),
especially in everyday-setting. However, other health signals which can be
easily and continuously acquired, such as photoplethysmography (PPG), show some
similarities with the Aortic Pressure waveform. Based on these similarities, in
recent years several methods were proposed to predict BP from the PPG signal.
Building on these results, we propose an advanced personalized data-driven
approach that uses a three-layer deep neural network to estimate BP based on
PPG signals. Different from previous work, the proposed model analyzes the PPG
signal in time-domain and automatically extracts the most critical features for
this specific application, then uses a variation of recurrent neural networks
called Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) to map the extracted features to the BP
value associated with that time window. Experimental results on two separate
standard hospital datasets, yielded absolute errors mean and absolute error
standard deviation for systolic and diastolic BP values outperforming prior

  - There are (deterministic) algorithms for constructing

an artificial neural network to parse sentences in some unknown format, through
a body of work known as RL-GRIT. A key aspect of the RL-GRIT approach is that
rather than explicitly inferring a grammar that describes the format, the
neural network learns to perform various parsing actions (such as merging two
tokens) over a corpus of sentences, with the goal of maximizing the estimated
frequency of the resulting parse structures. This can allow the learning
process to more easily explore different action choices, since a given choice
may change the optimality of the parse (as expressed by the total reward), but
will not result in the failure to parse a sentence. However, this also presents
a limitation: because the trained neural network can successfully parse any
sentence, it cannot be directly used to identify sentences that deviate from
the format of the training sentences, i.e., that are anomalous. In this paper,
we address this limitation by presenting procedures for extracting production
rules from the neural network, and for using these rules to determine whether a
given sentence is nominal or anomalous. When a sentence is anomalous, an
attempt is made to identify the location of the anomaly. We empirically
demonstrate that our approach is capable of grammatical inference and anomaly
detection for both non-regular formats and those containing regions of high
randomness/entropy. While a format with high randomness typically requires
large sets of production rules, we propose a two pass grammatical inference
method to generate parsimonious rule sets for such formats. By further
improving parser learning, and leveraging the presented rule extraction and
anomaly detection algorithms, one might begin to understand common errors,
either benign or malicious, in practical formats.

roughly constant. Consequently, only a minority of publications in the computer

research domains that study the effects of such large datasets on model

flexibility stems from a feature prior, which allows encoding relationships

(IMU) can provide accurate positioning in environments where the Global
Positioning System (GPS) service is either unavailable or has unsatisfactory

moving system. The UWB radio is typically located at the extremities of the
system to ensure reliable communication, whereas the IMUs are located closer to
its center of gravity. Furthermore, without hardware or software
synchronization, data from heterogeneous sensors can arrive at different time
instants resulting in temporal offsets. If uncalibrated, these spatial and
temporal offsets can degrade the positioning performance. In this paper, using
observability and identifiability criteria, we derive the conditions required
for successfully calibrating the spatial and the temporal offset parameters of
a tightly-coupled UWB-IMU system. We also present an online method for jointly
calibrating these offsets. The results show that our calibration approach

the detection of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) and extremely large
mass-ratio inspirals (X-MRIs). Their orbits are expected to be highly eccentric
and relativistic when entering the LISA band. Under these circumstances, the
inspiral time-scale given by Peters' formula loses precision and the shift of
the last-stable orbit (LSO) caused by the massive black hole spin could
influence the event rates estimate. We re-derive EMRIs and X-MRIs event rates
by implementing two different versions of a Kerr loss-cone angle that includes
the shift in the LSO, and a corrected version of Peters' time-scale that
accounts for eccentricity evolution, 1.5 post-Newtonian hereditary fluxes, and
spin-orbit coupling. The main findings of our study are summarized as follows:
(1) implementing a Kerr loss-cone changes the event rates by a factor ranging
between 0.9 and 1.1; (2) the high-eccentricity limit of Peters' formula offers
a reliable inspiral time-scale for EMRIs and X-MRIs, resulting in an event rate
estimate that deviates by a factor of about 0.9 to 3 when compared to event
rates computed with the corrected version of Peters' time-scale and the usual
loss-cone definition. (3) Event rates estimates for systems with a wide range
of eccentricities should be revised. Peters' formula overestimates the inspiral
rates of highly eccentric systems by a factor of about 8 to 30 compared to the
corrected values. Besides, for e$_0 \lesssim$0.8, implementing the corrected

most susceptible to charge exchange and exhibit drastically different
physicochemical properties depending on their charge density. In this regard,
spontaneous and uncontrollable ionization of graphene in the ambient air has
caused much confusion and technical difficulty in achieving experimental
reproducibility since its first report in 2004. Moreover, the same ambient hole

mechanism should be operative and apply to other low-dimensional materials
universally. In this Account, we review our breakthroughs in unraveling the
chemical origin and mechanistic requirements of the hidden CT reactions using
2-D crystals. We developed in-situ optical methods to quantify charge density
using Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and imaging. Using gas and
temperature-controlled in-situ measurements, we revealed that the electrical
holes are injected by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR): $O_{2}$ + $4H^{+}$ +
$4e^{-}$ $\rightleftharpoons$ $2H_{2}O$, which was independently verified by pH
dependence in HCl solutions. In addition to oxygen and water vapor, the overall
CT reaction requires hydrophilic dielectric substrates, which assist hydration
of the sample-substrate interface. The interface-localized reaction allowed us
to visualized and control interfacial molecular diffusion and CT by varing the
2-D gap spacing and introducing defects. The complete mechanism of the
fundamental charge exchange summarized in this Account will be essential in
exploring material and device properties of other low dimensional materials.

systems is an essential technique for various physical models, including the
QRM. However, despite its importance, a precise analytical study has not been
reported yet that successfully explains the sideband transition rates in a
driven QRM applicable for all system parameter configurations. In our study, we
analytically derive the sideband transition rates based on second-order
perturbation theory, not relying on the rotating wave approximation (RWA)
\cite{RWA}. Our formula are valid for all ranges of drive frequencies and
system's parameters. Our analytical derived formula agrees well with the
numerical results in a regime of moderate drive amplitudes. Interestingly, we
have found a non-trivial longitudinal drive effect derived from the transverse
drive Hamiltonian. This accounts for significant corrections to the sideband
transition rates that are expected without considering the derived longitudinal
effect. Using this approach, one can precisely estimate the sideband transition
rates in the QRM not confining themselves within specific parameter regimes.
This provides important contributions for understanding experiments described
by the driven QRM.

which aggravates the misalignment problem between images. At the cost of
incorporating a pose estimator, many works introduce pose information to
alleviate the misalignment in both training and testing. To achieve high
accuracy while preserving low inference complexity, we propose a network named
Pose-Guided Feature Learning with Knowledge Distillation (PGFL-KD), where the
pose information is exploited to regularize the learning of semantics aligned
features but is discarded in testing. PGFL-KD consists of a main branch (MB),
and two pose-guided branches, \ieno, a foreground-enhanced branch (FEB), and a
body part semantics aligned branch (SAB). The FEB intends to emphasise the
features of visible body parts while excluding the interference of obstructions
and background (\ieno, foreground feature alignment). The SAB encourages
different channel groups to focus on different body parts to have body part
semantics aligned representation. To get rid of the dependency on pose
information when testing, we regularize the MB to learn the merits of the FEB
and SAB through knowledge distillation and interaction-based training.
Extensive experiments on occluded, partial, and holistic ReID tasks show the

short-range) AFM order persists into the metallic regime. This decoupling is
understood as a result of the onset of an electronically phase separated state,
the occurrence of which seemingly depends on both synthesis method and rare
earth site magnetism. PDF analysis suggests that electronic phase separation
occurs without accompanying chemical phase segregation or changes in the
short-range crystallographic symmetry while synchrotron x-ray diffraction
confirms that there is no change in the long-range crystallographic symmetry.

manifold embedded in a high dimensional state space and each patch and its
similar patches to approximately lie on a linear affine subspace. Manifold
models are closely related to semi-local similarity, a well-known property of
natural images, referring to that for most natural-image patches, several
similar patches can be found in its spatial neighborhood. Many approaches to
single image interpolation use manifold models to exploit semi-local similarity
by two mutually exclusive parts: i) searching each target patch's similar
patches and ii) operating on the searched similar patches, the target patch and
the measured input pixels to estimate the target patch. Unfortunately, aliasing
in the input image makes it challenging for both parts. A very few works
explicitly deal with those challenges and only ad-hoc solutions are proposed.
  To overcome the challenge in the first part, we propose a carefully-designed
adaptive technique to remove aliasing in severely aliased regions, which cannot
be removed from traditional techniques. This technique enables reliable
identification of similar patches even in the presence of strong aliasing. To
overcome the challenge in the second part, we propose to use the

recommendation list, disguising the items as recommendations to elicit feedback
on the items to discover the user's additional tastes. This mix-in approach has
been widely used in many recommenders, but there is rare research, evaluating
the effectiveness of the mix-in approach or proposing a new approach for
eliciting user feedback without deceiving users. In this work, we aim to
propose a new approach for feedback elicitation without any deception and
compare our approach to the conventional mix-in approach for evaluation. To
this end, we designed a recommender interface that reveals which items are for
exploration and conducted a within-subject study with 94 MTurk workers. Our
results indicated that users left significantly more feedback on items chosen
for exploration with our interface. Besides, users evaluated that our new
interface is better than the conventional mix-in interface in terms of novelty,
diversity, transparency, trust, and satisfaction. Finally, path analysis show
that, in only our new interface, exploration caused to increase user-centric
evaluation metrics. Our work paves the way for how to design an interface,
which utilizes learning algorithm based on users' feedback signals, giving
better user experience and gathering more feedback data.

  randomized experiments with missing covariates",,,,,"stat.ME math.ST stat.TH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Complete randomization allows for consistent estimation of the average
treatment effect based on the difference in means of the outcomes without
strong modeling assumptions on the outcome-generating process. Appropriate use
of the pretreatment covariates can further improve the estimation efficiency.
However, missingness in covariates is common in experiments and raises an
important question: should we adjust for covariates subject to missingness, and
if so, how? The unadjusted difference in means is always unbiased. The
complete-covariate analysis adjusts for all completely observed covariates and
improves the efficiency of the difference in means if at least one completely
observed covariate is predictive of the outcome. Then what is the additional
gain of adjusting for covariates subject to missingness? A key insight is that
the missingness indicators act as fully observed pretreatment covariates as
long as missingness is not affected by the treatment, and can thus be used in
covariate adjustment to bring additional estimation efficiency. This motivates
adding the missingness indicators to the regression adjustment, yielding the
missingness-indicator method as a well-known but not so popular strategy in the
literature of missing data. We recommend it due to its many advantages. We also
propose modifications to the missingness-indicator method based on asymptotic
and finite-sample considerations. To reconcile the conflicting recommendations
in the missing data literature, we analyze and compare various strategies for
analyzing randomized experiments with missing covariates under the design-based
framework. This framework treats randomization as the basis for inference and
does not impose any modeling assumptions on the outcome-generating process and
missing-data mechanism.

  Renewable Energy Sources",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The notion of Virtual Power Plant (VPP) has been used many times in last
years in power systems and for several reasons. As a general trend, the
behavior of a classic synchronous generator is to be emulated for a class of
conventional grid components like, e.g., renewable generators or/and power
electronic units. Most of the times production of these units is of interest,
as it is the case for the new AGC scheme of Spain which, from this point of
view, looks like a VPP. However, dynamic aspects are of high importance,
especially for increasing the actual rate of penetration of Renewable Energy
Sources (RES). Indeed, to go above the actual rate of RES penetration, one
should deal with full participation of RES to grid services. For that, we
propose here a new concept called Dynamic VPP (DVPP) which fully integrates the
dynamic aspects at all levels: locally (for each RES generator), globally (for
grid ancillary services and interaction with other neighbor elements of the
grid) and economically (for internal optimal dispatch and participation to
electricity markets). A DVPP is a set of RES along with a set of control and
operation procedures. This means methodologies for: choosing the participating
RES, optimal and continuous operation as a whole (especially in case of loss of
natural resources - e.g., wind, sun - on a part of the DVPP), regulation (in
the dynamic sense) to ensure local objectives for each generator, participation
to ancillary services of the DVPP as a unit and to diminish negative effects of
interaction with neighbor dynamics elements of the power system, integration in
both actual power systems scenarios (with mixed classic and power electronics
based generation) and future ones with high degree of RES penetration.

  Attention","15 pages, 4 figures, and 9 tables",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transformers have made great progress in dealing with computer vision tasks.
However, existing vision transformers do not yet possess the ability of
building the interactions among features of different scales, which is
perceptually important to visual inputs. The reasons are two-fold: (1) Input
embeddings of each layer are equal-scale, so no cross-scale feature can be
extracted; (2) to lower the computational cost, some vision transformers merge
adjacent embeddings inside the self-attention module, thus sacrificing
small-scale (fine-grained) features of the embeddings and also disabling the
cross-scale interactions. To this end, we propose Cross-scale Embedding Layer
(CEL) and Long Short Distance Attention (LSDA). On the one hand, CEL blends
each embedding with multiple patches of different scales, providing the
self-attention module itself with cross-scale features. On the other hand, LSDA
splits the self-attention module into a short-distance one and a long-distance
counterpart, which not only reduces the computational burden but also keeps
both small-scale and large-scale features in the embeddings. Through the above
two designs, we achieve cross-scale attention. Besides, we put forward a
dynamic position bias for vision transformers to make the popular relative
position bias apply to variable-sized images. Hinging on the cross-scale
attention module, we construct a versatile vision architecture, dubbed
CrossFormer, which accommodates variable-sized inputs. Extensive experiments
show that CrossFormer outperforms the other vision transformers on image
classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic
segmentation tasks. The code has been released:

presently developing. Among the dowries of the quantum realm, entanglement is
one of the basic resources for the novel quantum revolution. Within this
context, one is faced with the problem of protecting the entanglement when a
system state is manipulated. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the
classical driving field on the generation entanglement between two qubits
interacting with a bosonic environment. We discuss the effect of the classical
field on the generation of entanglement between two (different) qubits and the
conditions under which it has a constructive role in protecting the
initial-state entanglement from decay induced by its environment. In
particular, in the case of similar qubits, we locate a stationary sub-space of
the system Hilbert space, characterized by states non depending on the
environment properties as well as on the classical driving-field. Thus, we are
able to determine the conditions to achieve maximally entangled stationary
states after a transient interaction with the environment. We show that,
overall, the classical driving field has a constructive role for the
entanglement protection in the strong coupling regime. Also, we illustrate that
a factorable initial-state can be driven in an entangled state and, even, in an
entangled steady-state after the interaction with the environment.

disentangled from joint distribution to marginal distribution, so that outliers
can also be well modeled. Abundant experimental analyses are presented, which
demonstrates the superiority and provides more insights into our method. The

To defend against adversarial attacks in a training-free and attack-agnostic

framework by delving into deep image prior (DIP). Fundamentally different from
existing reconstruction-based defenses, the proposed method analyzes and
explicitly incorporates the model decision process into our defense. Given an
adversarial image, firstly we map its reconstructed images during DIP
optimization to the model decision space, where cross-boundary images can be
detected and on-boundary images can be further localized. Then, adversarial
noise is purified by perturbing on-boundary images along the reverse direction
to the adversarial image. Finally, on-manifold images are stitched to construct
an image that can be correctly predicted by the victim classifier. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing
state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods both in defending white-box
attacks and defense-aware attacks. Moreover, the proposed method can maintain a
high visual quality during adversarial image reconstruction.

studies on control performance assessment (CPA) and optimal tuning. Minimum
output variance (MOV) is used as a benchmark for CPA of PID, but it is
difficult to be found due to the associated non-convex optimization problem.
For the optimal tuning, many different objective functions have been proposed,
but few consider the stochastic disturbance rejection. In this paper, a
multi-objective function simultaneously considering integral of absolute error
(IAE) and MOV is proposed to optimize PID for better disturbance rejection. The
non-convex problem and multi-objective problem are solved by
teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO). This stochastic optimization
algorithm can guarantee a tighter lower bound for MOV due to the excellent
capability of local optima avoidance and needs less calculation time due to the
low complexity. Furthermore, CPA and the tuning method are extended to the PI/P
cascade case. The results of several numerical examples of CPA problems show
that TLBO can generate better MOV than existing methods within one second on
most examples. The simulation results of the tuning method applied to two
temperature control systems reveal that the weight of the multi-objective
function can compromise other performance criteria such as overshoot and
settling time to improve the disturbance rejection. It also indicates that the
tuning method can be utilized to multi-stage PID control strategy to resolve
the contradiction between disturbance rejection and other performance criteria.

the hyperbolic dynamics, commonly known as the chaotic saddle, invalidates the
assumption of ergodicity. For the paradigmatic H\'enon-Heiles system, we use
both theoretical and numerical arguments to show that the escaping dynamics is
non-ergodic independently of the existence of KAM tori, since the chaotic
saddle, in whose vicinity trajectories are more likely to spend a finite amount
of time evolving before escaping forever, is not utterly spread over the energy
shell. Taking this into consideration, we provide a clarifying discussion about

account the information in the TIR modality itself, limiting the performance of
TIR tracking. To solve this problem, we propose to distill representations of
the TIR modality from the RGB modality with Cross-Modal Distillation (CMD) on a
large amount of unlabeled paired RGB-TIR data. We take advantage of the
two-branch architecture of the baseline tracker, i.e. DiMP, for cross-modal
distillation working on two components of the tracker. Specifically, we use one
branch as a teacher module to distill the representation learned by the model
into the other branch. Benefiting from the powerful model in the RGB modality,
the cross-modal distillation can learn the TIR-specific representation for
promoting TIR tracking. The proposed approach can be incorporated into
different baseline trackers conveniently as a generic and independent
component. Furthermore, the semantic coherence of paired RGB and TIR images is
utilized as a supervised signal in the distillation loss for cross-modal
knowledge transfer. In practice, three different approaches are explored to
generate paired RGB-TIR patches with the same semantics for training in an
unsupervised way. It is easy to extend to an even larger scale of unlabeled
training data. Extensive experiments on the LSOTB-TIR dataset and PTB-TIR

and current coupling of the tetraquark $T_{cc}^{+}$ are found by means of the

using partial widths of decay processes $T_{cc}^{+} \to \widetilde{ T}\pi ^{0}$

$\widetilde{T}=cc\overline{u}\overline{d}$ and $T_{cc;\overline{u}

first process, we apply the QCD three-point sum rule approach and extract
numerical value of the strong coupling $g$ that corresponds to the vertex
$T_{cc}^{+}\widetilde{T}\pi ^{0}$. The width of the second decay is estimated
using isospin symmetry and the prediction obtained for the first channel. Our
results for the mass $m=(3868\pm 124)~\mathrm{MeV}$ and width $ \Gamma=(489\pm

accurate deep neural networks. Some commonly-used loss functions, such as Cross
Entropy (CE), suffer from severe overfitting to noisy labels. Robust loss
functions that satisfy the symmetric condition were tailored to remedy this
problem, which however encounter the underfitting effect. In this paper, we
theoretically prove that \textbf{any loss can be made robust to noisy labels}
by restricting the network output to the set of permutations over a fixed
vector. When the fixed vector is one-hot, we only need to constrain the output
to be one-hot, which however produces zero gradients almost everywhere and thus
makes gradient-based optimization difficult. In this work, we introduce the
sparse regularization strategy to approximate the one-hot constraint, which is
composed of network output sharpening operation that enforces the output
distribution of a network to be sharp and the $\ell_p$-norm ($p\le 1$)
regularization that promotes the network output to be sparse. This simple
approach guarantees the robustness of arbitrary loss functions while not
hindering the fitting ability. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
can significantly improve the performance of commonly-used loss functions in
the presence of noisy labels and class imbalance, and outperform the
state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

the linear limit turns into instability as nonlinearity is increased past a
critical value, leading to a dynamical delocalization of the solitary wave (or
breathing) state. Finally, we suggest a concrete experiment to observe these
embedded modes using a bi-inductive electrical lattice.

and change type via $resampling$ as long as they are $active$. Each colony
contains a seed-bank into which individuals can enter to become $dormant$,
suspending their resampling until they exit the seed-bank and become active
again. Individuals resample not only from their own colony, but also from other
colonies according to a symmetric random walk transition kernel. The latter is
referred to as $migration$. The sizes of the populations vary across colonies
and remain constant in time.
  It was shown in Hollander and Nandan (2021) that the system is well-defined,
admits a family of equilibria parametrized by the initial density of type
$\heartsuit$, and exhibits a dichotomy between $clustering$ (mono-type
equilibrium) and $coexistence$ (multi-type equilibrium). This dichotomy is
determined by a clustering criterion that is given in terms of a dual of the
system, which consists of a system of $interacting$ coalescing random walks. In
this paper we provide an alternative clustering criterion, given in terms of an
auxiliary dual that is simpler than the original dual, and identify a range of
parameters for which the criterion is met, which we refer to as the
$clustering$ $regime$. It turns out that if the sizes of the active populations
are non-clumping (i.e., do not take arbitrarily large values in finite regions
of the geographic space) and the relative strengths of the seed-banks (i.e.,
the ratio of the sizes of dormant and active population in each colony) are
bounded uniformly over the geographic space, then clustering prevails if and

perceptual image qualities of the reference image and its distorted versions
are evaluated, often using degradation category ratings (DCR). However, the DCR
has been criticized since differences between rating categories on this ordinal
scale might not be perceptually equidistant, and observers may have different
understandings of the categories. Pair comparisons (PC) of distorted images,
followed by Thurstonian reconstruction of scale values, overcome these
problems. In addition, PC is more sensitive than DCR, and it can provide scale
values in fractional, just noticeable difference (JND) units that express a
precise perceptional interpretation. Still, the comparison of images of nearly
the same quality can be difficult. We introduce boosting techniques embedded in
more general triplet comparisons (TC) that increase the sensitivity even more.
Boosting amplifies the artefacts of distorted images, enlarges their visual
representation by zooming, increases the visibility of the distortions by a
flickering effect, or combines some of the above. Experimental results show the
effectiveness of boosted TC for seven types of distortion. We crowdsourced over
1.7 million responses to triplet questions. A detailed analysis shows that
boosting increases the discriminatory power and allows to reduce the number of
subjective ratings without sacrificing the accuracy of the resulting relative
image quality values. Our technique paves the way to fine-grained image quality
datasets, allowing for more distortion levels, yet with high-quality subjective

our end-to-end architecture with the transformer can efficiently learn the
interdependencies among multi-level features, thereby discovering a

regularization. When the time goes to infinity, the Tikhonov regularization
parameter is supposed to tend towards zero, not too fast, which is a key
property to make the trajectories strongly converge towards the minimizer of
$f$ of minimum norm. According to the structure of the heavy ball method for
strongly convex functions, the viscous damping coefficient is proportional to
the square root of the Tikhonov regularization parameter. Therefore, it also
converges to zero, which will ensure rapid convergence of values. Precisely,
under a proper tuning of these parameters, based on Lyapunov's analysis, we
show that the trajectories strongly converge towards the minimizer of minimum

For periodic systems using a general Monkhorst-Pack grid, there has been no
rigorous analysis of the finite-size error in the Hartree-Fock theory (HF) and
the second order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), which are the
simplest wavefunction based method, and the simplest post-Hartree-Fock method,
respectively. Such calculations can be viewed as a multi-dimensional integral
discretized with certain trapezoidal rules. Due to the Coulomb singularity, the
integrand has many points of discontinuity in general, and standard error
analysis based on the Euler-Maclaurin formula gives overly pessimistic results.
The lack of analytic understanding of finite-size errors also impedes the
development of effective finite-size correction schemes. We propose a unified
method to obtain sharp convergence rates of finite-size errors for the periodic
HF and MP2 theories. Our main technical advancement is a generalization of the
result of [Lyness, 1976] for obtaining sharp convergence rates of the
trapezoidal rule for a class of non-smooth integrands. Our result is applicable
to three-dimensional bulk systems as well as low dimensional systems (such as
nanowires and 2D materials). Our unified analysis also allows us to prove the
effectiveness of the Madelung-constant correction to the Fock exchange energy,

explicitly linked to geometric properties of the underlying sets
$\mathcal{X}^-, \mathcal{X}^+$ and their mutual arrangement. This
instance-specific viewpoint allows us to overcome the usual curse of
dimensionality (exponential width of the layers) in non-pathological situations
where the data carries low-complexity structure. We quantify the relevant
structure of the data in terms of a novel notion of mutual complexity (based on
a localized version of Gaussian mean width), which leads to sound and
informative separation guarantees. We connect our result with related lines of
work on approximation, memorization, and generalization.

significant interest in the area of research related to thermoelectrics.
Understanding the novel transport properties exhibited by these systems with
semiconducting ground state is an important focus area in this field. Large
thermal conductivity shown by most of the HH alloy possesses a major hurdle in
improving the figure of merit (ZT). Additionally, understanding the mechanism
of thermal conduction in heavy constituents HH alloys is an interesting aspect.
Here, we have investigated the high temperature thermoelectric properties of
ZrIrSb through experimental studies, phonon dispersion and electronic band
structure calculations. ZrIrSb is found to exhibit substantially lower
magnitude of resistivity and Seebeck coefficient near room temperature, owing
to existence of anti-site disorder between Ir/Sb and vacant sites.
Interestingly, in ZrIrSb, lattice thermal conductivity is governed by coupling
between the acoustic and low frequency optical phonon modes, which originates
due to heavier Ir/Sb atoms. This coupling leads to an enhancement in the
Umklapp processes due to the optical phonon excitations near zone boundary,
resulting in a lower magnitude of \k{appa}L. Our studies point to the fact that
the simultaneous existence of two heavy mass elements within a simple unit cell
can substantially decrease the lattice degrees of freedom.

same-resolution feature maps from multiple layers together via local
self-attention and cross-scale enhancement hallucinates higher-resolution

The results show that ACCENT efficiently produces stable attacks with

better transferability compared with baselines. We also confirm, via

to turbulence supercritically, in contrast to the subcritical Newtonian pipe
flows. Experimental evidences of subcritical and supercritical bifurcations of
viscoelastic pipe flows have been reported, but these nonlinear phenomena have
not been examined theoretically. In this work, we study the weakly nonlinear
stability of this flow by performing a multiple-scale expansion of the
disturbance around linear critical conditions. The perturbed parameter is
Reynolds number with the others being unperturbed. A third-order
Ginzburg-Landau equation is derived with its coefficient indicating the
bifurcation type of the flow. After exploring a large parameter space, we found
that polymer concentration plays an important role: at high polymer
concentrations (or small solvent-to-solution viscosity ratio
$\beta\lessapprox0.785$), the nonlinearity stabilises the flow, indicating that
the flow will bifurcate supercritically, while at low polymer concentrations
($\beta\gtrapprox 0.785$), the flow bifurcation is subcritical. The results
agree qualitatively with experimental observations where critical
$\beta\approx0.855$. The pipe flow of UCM fluids can be linearly unstable and
its bifurcation type is also supercritical. At a fixed value of $\beta$, the
Landau coefficient scales with the inverse of Weissenberg number ($Wi$) when
$Wi$ is sufficiently large. The present analysis provides a theoretical
understanding of the recent studies on the supercritical and subcritical routes

namely those among agents of different categories, while neglecting people's
diverse reaction patterns toward traffic agents in ifferent categories. To
address these problems, we propose a simple yet effective Unlimited
Neighborhood Interaction Network (UNIN), which predicts trajectories of
heterogeneous agents in multiple categories. Specifically, the proposed
unlimited neighborhood interaction module generates the fused-features of all
agents involved in an interaction simultaneously, which is adaptive to any
number of agents and any range of interaction area. Meanwhile, a hierarchical
graph attention module is proposed to obtain category-to-category interaction
and agent-to-agent interaction. Finally, parameters of a Gaussian Mixture Model
are estimated for generating the future trajectories. Extensive experimental
results on benchmark datasets demonstrate a significant performance improvement

We show that time-reversal ($T$), charge-conjugation ($C$), parity ($P$), and
discrete internal field rotation ($Z_n$) symmetries protect and characterize
the various types of edge states such as chiral and nonchiral solitons via
bulk-boundary correspondence in the presence of the multiple vacua. As two
representative models, we consider the JR model composed of a single fermion
field having a complex mass and the generalized JR model with two massless but
interacting fermion fields. The JR model shows nonchiral solitons with the
$Z_2$ rotation symmetry, whereas it shows chiral solitons with the broken $Z_2$
rotation symmetry. In the generalized JR model, only nonchiral solitons can
emerge with only $Z_2$ rotation symmetry, whereas both chiral and nonchiral
solitons can exist with enhanced $Z_4$ rotation symmetry. Moreover, we find
that the nonchiral solitons have $C, P$ symmetries while the chiral solitons do
not, which can be explained by the symmetry-invariant lines connecting
degenerate vacua. Finally, we find the symmetry correspondence between
multiply-degenerate global vacua and solitons such that ${T}$, ${C}$, ${P}$
symmetries of a soliton inherit from global minima that are connected by the
soliton, which provides a novel tool for the characterization of topological
solitons.

due to the lack of animal pose datasets. To address this problem we introduce
SyDog: a synthetic dataset of dogs containing ground truth pose and bounding
box coordinates which was generated using the game engine, Unity. We
demonstrate that pose estimation models trained on SyDog achieve better
performance than models trained purely on real data and significantly reduce
the need for the labour intensive labelling of images. We release the SyDog

This mismatch is known as sampling bias. Sampling biases are a major hindrance

prevalence bias. Prevalence bias is the discrepancy between the prevalence of a
pathology and its sampling rate in the training dataset, introduced upon
collecting data or due to the practioner rebalancing the training batches. This
paper lays the theoretical and computational framework for training models, and
for prediction, in the presence of prevalence bias. Concretely a bias-corrected
loss function, as well as bias-corrected predictive rules, are derived under
the principles of Bayesian risk minimization. The loss exhibits a direct
connection to the information gain. It offers a principled alternative to
heuristic training losses and complements test-time procedures based on
selecting an operating point from summary curves. It integrates seamlessly in
the current paradigm of (deep) learning using stochastic backpropagation and

interest in recent years because of their tremendous implications in nonlinear
optics and ultrafast quantum technology. In particular, the lifetime of
ultrashort plasmon oscillations has become a debatable subject in recent
experimental and theoretical studies to fulfill the future challenges
concerning their effective employment in the vast applications of the plasmonic
industry. Here, we examined the temporal properties of nonlinear plasmonic
modes in metal nanostructures by interacting them with quantum objects in the
weak coupling regime in order to distinguish it from the fundamental plasmonic
mode. First of all, we present an analytical description of nonlinear ultrafast
dynamics of localized surface plasmon resonances when the second harmonic
plasmon mode interacts with long-lived dark mode or quantum emitter. Later, the
coupled plasmonic system is realized in two different ways to control the
lifetime of second harmonic mode by coupling, i) driven mode to dark mode (or
long lifetime quantum emitter) ii)itself to dark mode (or long lifetime quantum
emitter). The driven-dissipative dynamics are solved through a numerical
technique governing the spatial and temporal changes in the second harmonic
plasmonic response supported by AuNP. Finally, the lifetime enhancement of
nonlinear plasmon mode is manifested by performing FDTD simulations for a
nonlinear plasmonic system of Au nanoparticles coupled with a long lifetime
quantum emitter.

effective action derived in the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism appropriate for
non-equilibrium quantum field theory. We solve this non-local equation by means
of multiple-scale perturbation theory appropriate for time-dependent systems,
obtaining approximate analytic solutions valid for very long times. The
non-linear effects lead to power-law damping of oscillations, that at late
times transition to exponentially damped ones characteristic for linear
systems. These solutions describe the evolution very well, as we demonstrate
numerically in a number of examples. We then approximate the non-local equation
of motion by a Markovianised one, resolving the ambiguities appearing in the
process, and solve it utilizing the same methods to find the very same leading
approximate solution. This comparison justifies the use of Markovian equations
at leading order. The standard time-dependent perturbation theory in comparison
is not capable of describing the non-linear condensate evolution beyond the
early time regime of negligible damping. The macroscopic evolution of the
condensate is interpreted in terms of microphysical particle processes. Our
results have implications for the quantitative description of the decay of

promising sites for producing both (stellar-mass) compact object mergers and
extreme mass ratio inspirals. Along with the disk-assisted migration/evolution
process, ambient gas materials inevitably accrete onto the compact objects. The
description of this process is subject to significant theoretical uncertainties
in previous studies. It was commonly assumed that either an Eddington accretion
rate or a Bondi accretion rate (or any rate in between) takes place, although
these two rates can differ from each other by several orders of magnitude. As a
result, the mass and spin evolution of compact objects within AGN disks are
essentially unknown. In this work, we construct a relativistic supercritical
inflow-outflow model for black hole (BH) accretion. We show that the radiation
efficiency of the supercritical accretion of a stellar-mass BH (sBH) is
generally too low to explain the proposed electromagnetic counterpart of
GW190521. Applying this model to sBHs embedded in AGN disks, we find that,
although the gas inflow rates at Bondi radii of these sBHs are in general
highly super-Eddington, a large fraction of inflowing gas eventually escapes as
outflows so that only a small fraction accretes onto the sBH, resulting in
mildly super-Eddington BH absorption in most cases. We also implement this
inflow-outflow model to study the evolution of neutron stars (NS) and white
dwarfs (WD) in AGN disks, taking into account corrections from star sizes and
star magnetic fields. It turns out to be difficult for WDs to grow to the
Chandrasekhar limit via accretion because WDs are spun up more efficiently to
reach the shedding limit before the Chandrasekhar limit. For NSs the
accretion-induced collapse is possible if NS magnetic fields are sufficiently
strong, keeping the NS in a slow rotation state during accretion.

formulate item reviews as sequential decision-making problems to realize
adaptive instruction based on the knowledge state of students. It has been
reported previously that reinforcement learning can help realize mathematical
models of students learning strategies to maintain a high memory rate. However,
optimization using reinforcement learning requires a large number of
interactions, and thus it cannot be applied directly to actual students. In
this study, we propose a framework for optimizing teaching strategies by
constructing a virtual model of the student while minimizing the interaction
with the actual teaching target. In addition, we conducted an experiment
considering actual instructions using the mathematical model and confirmed that
the model performance is comparable to that of conventional teaching methods.
Our framework can directly substitute mathematical models used in experiments
with human students, and our results can serve as a buffer between theoretical
instructional optimization and practical applications in e-learning systems.

Systems (ADSs) for providing a safety-guaranteed driving experience. An
accident anticipation model aims to predict accidents promptly and accurately
before they occur. Existing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models of accident
anticipation lack a human-interpretable explanation of their decision-making.
Although these models perform well, they remain a black-box to the ADS users,
thus difficult to get their trust. To this end, this paper presents a Gated
Recurrent Unit (GRU) network that learns spatio-temporal relational features
for the early anticipation of traffic accidents from dashcam video data. A
post-hoc attention mechanism named Grad-CAM is integrated into the network to
generate saliency maps as the visual explanation of the accident anticipation
decision. An eye tracker captures human eye fixation points for generating
human attention maps. The explainability of network-generated saliency maps is
evaluated in comparison to human attention maps. Qualitative and quantitative
results on a public crash dataset confirm that the proposed explainable network
can anticipate an accident on average 4.57 seconds before it occurs, with
94.02% average precision. In further, various post-hoc attention-based XAI
methods are evaluated and compared. It confirms that the Grad-CAM chosen by
this study can generate high-quality, human-interpretable saliency maps (with
1.23 Normalized Scanpath Saliency) for explaining the crash anticipation

profound interdependence among nations or regions. This has been particularly
evident in tourism, one of the sectors most affected by uncoordinated mobility
restrictions. The impact of this interdependence on the tendency to adopt less
or more restrictive measures is hard to evaluate, more so if diversity in
economic exposures to citizens' mobility are considered. Here, we address this
problem by developing an analytical and computational game-theoretical model
encompassing the conflicts arising from the need to control the economic
effects of global risks, such as in the COVID-19 pandemic. The model includes
the individual costs derived from severe restrictions imposed by governments,
including the resulting economic interdependence among all the parties involved
in the game. By using tourism-based data, the model is enriched with actual
heterogeneous income losses, such that every player has a different economic
cost when applying restrictions. We show that economic interdependence enhances
cooperation because of the decline in the expected payoffs by free-riding
parties (i.e., those neglecting the application of mobility restrictions).
Furthermore, we show (analytically and through numerical simulations) that
these cross-exposures can transform the nature of the cooperation dilemma each
region or country faces, modifying the position of the fixed points and the
size of the basins of attraction that characterize this class of games.
Finally, our results suggest that heterogeneity among regions may be used to
leverage the impact of intervention policies by ensuring an agreement among the

homogeneous medium bounded by a two-dimensional, perfectly conducting, and
locally defected periodic surface, and develops a high-accuracy
boundary-integral-equation (BIE) solver. Along the vertical direction, we place
a PML to truncate the unbounded domain onto a strip and prove that the PML
solution converges linearly to the true solution in the physical subregion of
the strip with the PML thickness. Laterally, we divide the unbounded strip into
three regions: a region containing the defect and two semi-waveguide regions,
separated by two vertical line segments. In both semi-waveguides, we prove the
well-posedness of an associated scattering problem so as to well define a
Neumann-to-Dirichlet (NtD) operator on the associated vertical segment. The two
NtD operators, serving as exact lateral boundary conditions, reformulate the
unbounded strip problem as a boundary value problem onto the defected region.
Due to the periodicity of the semi-waveguides, both NtD operators turn out to
be closely related to a Neumann-marching operator, governed by a nonlinear
Riccati equation. It is proved that the Neumann-marching operators are
contracting, so that the PML solution decays exponentially fast along both
lateral directions. The consequences culminate in two opposite aspects.
Negatively, the PML solution cannot exponentially converge to the true solution
in the whole physical region of the strip. Positively, from a numerical
perspective, the Riccati equations can now be efficiently solved by a recursive
doubling procedure and a high-accuracy PML-based BIE method so that the
boundary value problem on the defected region can be solved efficiently and
accurately. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the PML solution converges
exponentially fast to the true solution in any compact subdomain of the strip.

Second, we compare the accumulative rewards of the three MAB algorithms with

the larger difference between the success rates of competing recommendations
the more accumulative rewards the MAB algorithms can achieve. In addition, we

we present a query expansion method, which is combined in the manifold ranking
to resolve this problem. Our method not only utilizes the information of the

Kelly table, which corresponds to the law of multiplication of these CSF. The
properties of the CSF allow you to build an isomorphic transition from a filled

  1: Accuracy",,,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Researchers at the Ames Laboratory-USDOE and the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) conducted a study to assess the performance of forensic
examiners in firearm investigations. The study involved three different types
of firearms and 173 volunteers who compared both bullets and cartridge cases.
The total number of comparisons reported is 20,130, allocated to assess
accuracy (8,640), repeatability (5,700), and reproducibility (5,790) of the
evaluations made by participating examiners. The overall false positive error
rate was estimated as 0.656% and 0.933% for bullets and cartridge cases,
respectively, while the rate of false negatives was estimated as 2.87% and
1.87% for bullets and cartridge cases, respectively. Because chi-square tests
of independence strongly suggest that error probabilities are not the same for
each examiner, these are maximum likelihood estimates based on the
beta-binomial probability model and do not depend on an assumption of equal
examiner-specific error rates. Corresponding 95% confidence intervals are
(0.305%,1.42%) and (0.548%,1.57%) for false positives for bullets and cartridge
cases, respectively, and (1.89%,4.26%) and (1.16%,2.99%) for false negatives
for bullets and cartridge cases, respectively. These results are based on data
representing all controlled conditions considered, including different firearm
manufacturers, sequence of manufacture, and firing separation between unknown
and known comparison specimens. The results are consistent with those of prior
studies, despite its more robust design and challenging specimens.

  Patients","8 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in Bangladesh, and as
a result, Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is widespread in the population. DR, an eye
illness caused by diabetes, can lead to blindness if it is not identified and
treated in its early stages. Unfortunately, diagnosis of DR requires medically
trained professionals, but Bangladesh has limited specialists in comparison to
its population. Moreover, the screening process is often expensive, prohibiting
many from receiving timely and proper diagnosis. To address the problem, we
introduce a deep learning algorithm which screens for different stages of DR.
We use a state-of-the-art CNN architecture to diagnose patients based on
retinal fundus imagery. This paper is an experimental evaluation of the
algorithm we developed for DR diagnosis and screening specifically for
Bangladeshi patients. We perform this validation study using separate pools of
retinal image data of real patients from a hospital and field studies in
Bangladesh. Our results show that the algorithm is effective at screening
Bangladeshi eyes even when trained on a public dataset which is out of domain,
and can accurately determine the stage of DR as well, achieving an overall
accuracy of 92.27\% and 93.02\% on two validation sets of Bangladeshi eyes. The
results confirm the ability of the algorithm to be used in real clinical
settings and applications due to its high accuracy and classwise metrics. Our
algorithm is implemented in the application Drishti, which is used to screen
for DR in patients living in rural areas in Bangladesh, where access to
professional screening is limited.

  task amenability","Accepted at ASMUS 2021 (The 2nd International Workshop of Advances in
  Simplifying Medical UltraSound)",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The performance of many medical image analysis tasks are strongly associated
with image data quality. When developing modern deep learning algorithms,
rather than relying on subjective (human-based) image quality assessment (IQA),
task amenability potentially provides an objective measure of task-specific
image quality. To predict task amenability, an IQA agent is trained using
reinforcement learning (RL) with a simultaneously optimised task predictor,
such as a classification or segmentation neural network. In this work, we
develop transfer learning or adaptation strategies to increase the adaptability
of both the IQA agent and the task predictor so that they are less dependent on
high-quality, expert-labelled training data. The proposed transfer learning
strategy re-formulates the original RL problem for task amenability in a
meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) framework. The resulting algorithm
facilitates efficient adaptation of the agent to different definitions of image
quality, each with its own Markov decision process environment including
different images, labels and an adaptable task predictor. Our work demonstrates
that the IQA agents pre-trained on non-expert task labels can be adapted to
predict task amenability as defined by expert task labels, using only a small
set of expert labels. Using 6644 clinical ultrasound images from 249 prostate
cancer patients, our results for image classification and segmentation tasks
show that the proposed IQA method can be adapted using data with as few as
respective 19.7% and 29.6% expert-reviewed consensus labels and still achieve
comparable IQA and task performance, which would otherwise require a training
dataset with 100% expert labels.

  Multi-leak In Pipelines",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pipelines for water supply are susceptible to burst-leakage due to fluid
pressures of various nature. High pressure heads resulting in circumferential
and (or) axial stresses larger than the material yield stress could cause pipe
failure. Of equal concern is the local boiling or cavitation effect in regions
of fluid pressure dropping below its vapor pressure, which in turn develop air
bubbles that get transported through the pipeline, bursting later at remote
locations. We initially developed a simple probabilistic model based on Method
of Characteristics (MOC) to simulate burst leakage in pipelines, and compared
with a pure deterministic hydraulic model. We had not considered cavitation
effects for simplicity. The results indicated that the simple probabilistic
model was only marginally different in its prediction of the transients on
comparison with the latter. In order to determine the position and amount of
leakage in the distribution system, the detection method based on simulating
hydraulic transients was further evaluated using Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).
We found that this non-linear filtering approach on the fluid transient model
considerably reduced the number of input parameters required, and it was able
to predict leakage rate and burst positions even in a highly noisy environment.

performing on-premises tasks within hospitals or medical centers also
increases. Many healthcare organizations are progressively embracing or
adopting an edge computing paradigm such that computationally intensive tasks
can be processed at the edge of the network in order to avoid latency and
network reliability issues associated with offloading tasks to the cloud. The
problem, however, hospitals or medical centers may not be equipped with
sufficient computing resources that can process advanced ML or AI tasks
efficiently. In addition, some tasks may not be easily offloadable or contain
sensitive patient healthcare data which increases the risks of having malicious
attacks. In this paper, we extend our Edgify resource provisioning framework to
consider the task offloading of healthcare applications' involving patients'
data as a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) process that often involves
multiple conflicting criteria (e.g. data privacy risks, costs, latency, network
reliability, among others). We evaluate our proposed framework through a number
of experiments which demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of employing
our optimization approach within hospitals or medical centers.
