of their improved energy efficiency and inference performance compared to CPUs
and GPUs. Such accelerators are thus well suited for resource-constrained
embedded systems. However, mapping sophisticated neural network models on these
accelerators still entails significant energy and memory consumption, along
with high inference time overhead. Binarized neural networks (BNNs), which
utilize single-bit weights, represent an efficient way to implement and deploy
neural network models on accelerators. In this paper, we present a novel
optical-domain BNN accelerator, named ROBIN, which intelligently integrates
heterogeneous microring resonator optical devices with complementary
capabilities to efficiently implement the key functionalities in BNNs. We
perform detailed fabrication-process variation analyses at the optical device
level, explore efficient corrective tuning for these devices, and integrate
circuit-level optimization to counter thermal variations. As a result, our
proposed ROBIN architecture possesses the desirable traits of being robust,
energy-efficient, low latency, and high throughput, when executing BNN models.
Our analysis shows that ROBIN can outperform the best-known optical BNN
accelerators and also many electronic accelerators. Specifically, our
energy-efficient ROBIN design exhibits energy-per-bit values that are ~4x lower
than electronic BNN accelerators and ~933x lower than a recently proposed
photonic BNN accelerator, while a performance-efficient ROBIN design shows ~3x
and ~25x better performance than electronic and photonic BNN accelerators,
respectively.

the patient's side, which tends to increase surgeon fatigue and may reduce the
efficiency of the operation. This paper introduces a Robotic Partner (RP) to
facilitate intuitive bimanual telesurgery, aiming at reducing the surgeon
workload and enhancing surgeon-assisted capability. An interval type-2
polynomial fuzzy-model-based learning algorithm is employed to extract expert
domain knowledge from surgeons and reflect environmental interaction
information. Based on this, a bimanual shared control is developed to interact
with the other robot teleoperated by the surgeon, understanding their control
and providing assistance. As prior information of the environment model is not
required, it reduces reliance on force sensors in control design. Experimental
results on the DaVinci Surgical System show that the RP could assist
peg-transfer tasks and reduce the surgeon's workload by 51\% in
force-sensor-free scenarios.

Reinforce algorithm to handle non-differentiable segmentation constraints. The

However, existing N2N-based methods are not suitable for learning from the

this issue by proposing the deformation-compensated learning (DeCoLearn) method
for training deep reconstruction networks by compensating for object

is jointly trained with the deep reconstruction network without any
ground-truth supervision. We validate DeCoLearn on both simulated and

Furthermore, we also study a variant of the problem in which the source, not

observations noises under the null hypothesis are Gaussian. For this model, our
main result is an upper bound on the exponent-rate function. The bound is shown
to mirror a corresponding explicit lower bound, except that the lower bound
involves the source power (variance) whereas the upper bound has the source
entropy power. Part of the utility of the established bound is for
investigating asymptotic exponent/rates and losses incurred by distributed
detection as function of the number of sensors.

reinforcement learning as it provides succinct and informative representation
for states, by taking the eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix of the
state-transition graph as state embeddings. Such representation captures the
geometry of the underlying state space and is beneficial to RL tasks such as
option discovery and reward shaping. To approximate the Laplacian
representation in large (or even continuous) state spaces, recent works propose
to minimize a spectral graph drawing objective, which however has infinitely
many global minimizers other than the eigenvectors. As a result, their learned
Laplacian representation may differ from the ground truth. To solve this
problem, we reformulate the graph drawing objective into a generalized form and
derive a new learning objective, which is proved to have eigenvectors as its
unique global minimizer. It enables learning high-quality Laplacian
representations that faithfully approximate the ground truth. We validate this
via comprehensive experiments on a set of gridworld and continuous control
environments. Moreover, we show that our learned Laplacian representations lead
to more exploratory options and better reward shaping.

a novel detection scheme (also trained at design time) is used to detect
various cyber-attacks (as anomalies) at runtime. We evaluate our proposed LATTE

An accurate classification model needs a large dataset; however, generating a
large dataset is costly for complex simulation-based problems. After training
by a small dataset, surrogate models can generate a large pseudo dataset
efficiently. Errors, however, may be introduced by surrogate modeling. This
paper investigates the mutual effect of a large pseudo dataset and surrogate
modeling uncertainty. Four widely used methods, i.e., Naive Bayes classifier,
support vector machine, random forest regression, and artificial neural network
for classification, are studied on four benchmark problems. Kriging is used as
the basic surrogate model method. The results show that a large pseudo dataset
improves the classification accuracy, which depends on both design problems and
classification algorithms. Except for the Naive Bayes, the other three methods
are recommended for using pseudo data to improve classification performance.
Also, a wind turbine design problem is used to illustrate the effect of the
pseudo dataset on feasible subspace recognition. The large pseudo dataset
improves the recognized subspace bound greatly, which can be reproduced by
classification models well except for the Naive Bayes classifier. Under the
uncertainty of surrogate modeling, the random forest presents high robustness
to recognize the feasible design domain bound, while the artificial neural
network demonstrates a high sensitivity to uncertainty with the recognized
bound deteriorated.

their kinematics design: rigid and non-rigid origami. However, such
categorization can be superficial, and rigid origami can obtain new mechanical
properties by intentionally relaxing the rigid-folding kinematics. Based on
numerical simulations using the bar-hinge approach and experiments, this study
examines the multi-stability of a stacked Miura-origami cellular structure with
different levels of facet compliance. The simulation and experiment results
show that a unit cell in such cellular solid exhibits only two stable states if
it follows the rigid origami kinematics; however, two more stable states are
reachable if the origami facets become sufficiently compliant. Moreover, the
switch between two certain stable states shows an asymmetric energy barrier,
meaning that the unit cell follows fundamentally different deformation paths
when it extends from one state to another compared to the opposite compression
switch. As a result, the reaction force required for extending this unit cell
between these two states can be higher than the compression switch. Such
asymmetric multi-stability can be fine-tuned by tailoring the underlying
origami design, and it can be extended into cellular solids with carefully
placed voids. By showing the benefits of exploiting facet compliance, this
study could foster multi-functional structures and material systems that
traditional rigid origami cannot create.

associated with a reduced ability of CD8+ T cells to mount an effective

information, while the relatedness information between the query and support
samples is not fully exploited; 2) the meta-learner is usually constrained by
the limited contextual information of the local episode. To overcome these
problems, we propose a new Global Relatedness Decoupled-Distillation (GRDD)
method using the global category knowledge and the Relatedness
Decoupled-Distillation (RDD) strategy. Our GRDD learns new visual concepts
quickly by imitating the habit of humans, i.e. learning from the deep knowledge
distilled from the teacher. More specifically, we first train a global learner
on the entire base subset using category labels as supervision to leverage the
global context information of the categories. Then, the well-trained global
learner is used to simulate the query-support relatedness in global
dependencies. Finally, the distilled global query-support relatedness is
explicitly used to train the meta-learner using the RDD strategy, with the goal
of making the meta-learner more discriminative. The RDD strategy aims to
decouple the dense query-support relatedness into the groups of sparse
decoupled relatedness. Moreover, only the relatedness of a single support
sample with other query samples is considered in each group. By distilling the
sparse decoupled relatedness group by group, sharper relatedness can be
effectively distilled to the meta-learner, thereby facilitating the learning of
a discriminative meta-learner. We conduct extensive experiments on the
miniImagenet and CIFAR-FS datasets, which show the state-of-the-art performance
of our GRDD method.

periodically interrupted for technological operations with the spacecraft.
These time intervals are usually used by the Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC telescope
to perform calibrations. In this context, SRG carried out scanning observations
of the Puppis A supernova remnant (SNR) with the aim to check the imaging
performance of ART-XC and to optimize the technique of image reconstruction for
extended objects. Using the unique imaging capabilities of ART-XC and its
uniform coverage of the entire Puppis A region, we attempted to investigate the
morphology of this SNR at energies >4 keV, and to search for previously unknown
X-ray sources. Puppis A was observed in 2019-2020, conducting 1.5 x 1.5 degrees
shallow surveys with an exposure of 36 hours. Additional deep pointed
observations of the central part of Puppis A were carried out in 2021 lasted 31
hours to highlight the morphology of the extended emission. The X-ray emission
of the Puppis A was significantly detected as an extended structure in the 4-6
keV energy band. The morphology of the emission is in general agreement with
that observed in soft X-rays previously. The deep sky image of Puppis A
obtained with the ART-XC telescope is characterized by a typical SNR shell rim
morphology, an extended emission and a bright emission knot in the
north-eastern part of the supernova shell. Also, four point X-ray sources have
been detected, including three objects identified in catalogs, and one newly
discovered X-ray emitter.

The DL models were trained and evaluated in different hypothetical experimental
situations. A decreased performance is observed when more realistic
experimental effects (acceptance cuts and decreased resolutions) are taken into
account. It is shown that the performance can be improved by combining multiple
events to make predictions. The PointNet based models trained on the
reconstructed tracks of charged particles from the CBM detector simulation
discriminate a crossover transition from a first order phase transition with an
accuracy of up to 99.8%. The models were subjected to several tests to evaluate
the dependence of its performance on the centrality of the collisions and
physical parameters of fluid dynamic simulations. The models are shown to work
in a broad range of centralities (b=0-7 fm). However, the performance is found
to improve for central collisions (b=0-3 fm). There is a drop in the
performance when the model parameters lead to reduced duration of the fluid
dynamic evolution or when less fraction of the medium undergoes the transition.
These effects are due to the limitations of the underlying physics and the DL
models are shown to be superior in its discrimination performance in comparison
to conventional mean observables.

understanding of planetary formation and evolution. Kepler-80, a K-dwarf
hosting six super-Earths, was the first system known to have four planets in a
chain of resonances, a repeated geometric configuration. Transiting planets in
resonant chains can enable us to estimate not only the planets' orbits and
sizes but also their masses. Since the original resonance analysis and TTV
fitting of Kepler-80, a new planet has been discovered whose signal likely
altered the measured masses of the other planets. Here, we determine masses and
orbits for all six planets hosted by Kepler-80 by direct forward photodynamical
modeling of the lightcurve of this system. We then explore the resonant
behaviour of the system. We find that the four middle planets are in a resonant
chain, but that the outermost planet only dynamically interacts in $\sim14$\%

consistent with \emph{in situ} formation and compare our results to two other

cosmological dark matter simulation and the {\tt GALFORM} semi-analytical model
of galaxy formation. Utilising the full ($800$ Mpc)$^3$ volume of the
simulation, we studied the statistics of galaxy mergers in terms of merger
rates and close pair fractions. We predict that merger rates begin to drop
rapidly for high-mass galaxies ($M_*>10^{11.3}-10^{10.5}$ $M_\odot$ for
$z=0-4$), as a result of the exponential decline in the galaxy stellar mass
function. The predicted merger rates increase and then turn over with
increasing redshift, by $z=3.5$, in disagreement with hydrodynamical
simulations and semi-empirical models. In agreement with most other models and
observations, we find that close pair fractions flatten or turn over at some
redshift (dependent on the mass selection). We conduct an extensive comparison
of close pair fractions, and highlight inconsistencies among models, but also
between different observations. We provide a fitting formula for the major
merger timescale for close galaxy pairs, in which the slope of the stellar mass
dependence is redshift dependent. This is in disagreement with previous
theoretical results that implied a constant slope. Instead we find a weak
redshift dependence only for massive galaxies ($M_*>10^{10}$ M$_\odot$): in
this case the merger timescale varies approximately as $M_*^{-0.55}$. We find
that close pair fractions and merger timescales depend on the maximum projected
separation as $r_\mathrm{max}^{1.32}$. This is in agreement with observations

by the Communist Party in a recent Information Operation - the one conducted to
influence the narrative around the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong. We use
a Twitter dataset containing account information and tweets for the operation.
Our research shows that the Hong Kong operation was (at least) partially
conducted manually by humans rather than entirely by automated bots. We also
show that the Communist Party mixed in personal attacks on Chinese dissidents
and messages on COVID-19 with the party's views on the protests during the
operation. Finally, we conclude that the Information Operation network in the
Twitter dataset was set up to amplify content generated elsewhere rather than
to influence the narrative with original content.

about the geometry of the source spacetime and the fundamental nature of
gravity, making the measurement of black hole ringdowns a key goal of
gravitational wave astronomy. However, this task is plagued by technical
challenges that invalidate the naive application of standard data analysis
methods and complicate sensitivity projections. In this paper, we provide a
comprehensive account of the formalism required to properly carry out ringdown
analyses, examining in detail the foundations of recent observational results,
and providing a framework for future measurements. We build on those insights
to clarify the concepts of ringdown detectability and resolvability -- touching
on the drawbacks of both Bayes factors and naive Fisher matrix approaches --
and find that overly pessimistic heuristics have led previous works to
underestimate the role of ringdown overtones for black hole spectroscopy. We
put our framework to work on the analysis of a variety of simulated signals in
colored noise, including analytic injections and a numerical relativity
simulation consistent with GW150914. We demonstrate that we can use tones of
the quadrupolar angular harmonic to test the no-hair theorem at current
sensitivity, with precision comparable to published constraints from real data.

for future, louder signals. We release ringdown, a Python library for analyzing

the data of the first year of the all-sky X-ray survey by the SRG orbital
observatory. The sources were selected due to their brightness in the 4--12 keV
band in the data of the Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC telescope. They are also
detected by the eROSITA telescope, which provided accurate localizations and
spectral data for broad-band spectral analysis. All three objects had been
previously known as X-ray sources from the ROSAT all-sky survey and XMM-Newton
slew survey, but their nature remained unknown. The X-ray spectra obtained by
eROSITA and ART-XC are consistent with optically thin thermal emission with a
temperature kT>~15 keV for SRGAJ194638.9+704552 and SRGAJ225412.8+690658 and
kT>~5 keV for SRGAJ204547.8+672642. This, together with the inferred high X-ray
luminosities ($2\times 10^{32}$-$3\times 10^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$), strongly
suggests that all three sources are CVs. We have obtained optical photometry
and spectroscopy for these objects using the AZT-33IK 1.6-m telescope of the
Sayan Observatory. The optical properties confirm the CV nature of the objects.
We conclude that SRGAJ194638.9+704552 is an intermediate polar,
SRGAJ204547.8+672642 is most likely a polar or an intermediate polar, and
SRGAJ225412.8+690658 can be either a magnetic or a non-magnetic CV. We also
measured an orbital period of 2.98~hours for SRGAJ204547.8+672642, based on
TESS data. Three out of the planned eight SRG all-sky surveys have now been
completed. We expect to find plenty of new CVs during the survey and to
continue our optical follow-up program.

detectors is carefully examined from the quantum field theoretical point of
view. The readout scheme in gravitational-wave detectors specifies the directly
measured quantum operator in the detection. This specification is necessary
when we apply the recently developed quantum measurement theory to
gravitational-wave detections. We examine the two models of measurement. One is
the model in which the directly measured quantum operator at the photodetector
is Glauber's photon number operator, and the other is the model in which the
power operator of the optical field is directly measured. These two are
regarded as ideal models of photodetectors. We first show these two models
yield the same expectation value of the measurement. Since it is consensus in
the gravitational-wave community that vacuum fluctuations contribute to the
noises in the detectors, we also clarify the contributions of vacuum
fluctuations to the quantum noise spectral density without using the two-photon
formulation which is used in the gravitational-wave community. We found that
the conventional noise spectral density in the two-photon formulation includes
vacuum fluctuations from the main interferometer but does not include those
from the local oscillator. Although the contribution of vacuum fluctuations
from the local oscillator theoretically yields the difference between the above
two models in the noise spectral densities, this difference is negligible in
realistic situations.

Taylor approximations about a reference trajectory. These dynamics enable the
upper-level planning problem to reason about contact timing and forces, and
generate entirely new contact-mode sequences online. To achieve reliable and
fast numerical convergence, we devise a structure-exploiting interior-point

tracking problem. We demonstrate real-time solution rates for CI-MPC and the
ability to generate and track non-periodic behaviours in hardware experiments

intelligent assistive robots, but collecting large annotated datasets requires
time-consuming temporal labeling and raises privacy concerns, e.g., if the data
is collected in a real household. In this work, we explore the concept of
constructing training examples for ADL recognition by playing life simulation
video games and introduce the SIMS4ACTION dataset created with the popular
commercial game THE SIMS 4. We build Sims4Action by specifically executing
actions-of-interest in a ""top-down"" manner, while the gaming circumstances
allow us to freely switch between environments, camera angles and subject
appearances. While ADL recognition on gaming data is interesting from the
theoretical perspective, the key challenge arises from transferring it to the
real-world applications, such as smart-homes or assistive robotics. To meet
this requirement, Sims4Action is accompanied with a GamingToReal benchmark,
where the models are evaluated on real videos derived from an existing ADL
dataset. We integrate two modern algorithms for video-based activity
recognition in our framework, revealing the value of life simulation video
games as an inexpensive and far less intrusive source of training data.
However, our results also indicate that tasks involving a mixture of gaming and
real data are challenging, opening a new research direction. We will make our

demands of the COVID-19 pandemic, although with potentially lower sensitivity

violated: testing done on networks (housemates, spouses, co-workers) captures
correlated individuals, while infection risk varies substantially across time,

established optimality grids and induce a sub-optimal implementation of the

necessity of integrating field sampling information with statistical modeling
to efficiently optimize pooled testing. Using real data, we show that (a)
greater gains can be achieved at low logistical cost by exploiting natural
correlations (non-independence) between samples -- allowing improvements in
sensitivity and efficiency of up to 30% and 90% respectively; and (b) these
gains are robust despite substantial heterogeneity across pools

approach this issue by using deep network policies and reparameterize actions

the structure of dynamical systems in a hierarchical deep policy learning

fitting deep dynamical systems to diverse data directly, H-NDPs form a
curriculum by learning local dynamical system-based policies on small regions
in state-space and then distill them into a global dynamical system-based
policy that operates only from high-dimensional images. H-NDPs additionally
provide smooth trajectories, a strong safety benefit in the real world. We
perform extensive experiments on dynamic tasks both in the real world (digit

place to place at random. The particle carries all the physical properties of
the respective type of particle, mass, charge, magnetic momentum, etc. It jumps

flow methods typically use a multiresolution approach with image warping when a
broad range of flow velocities and heterogeneous motion is present. Accuracy of
such coarse-to-fine methods is affected by the ghosting artifacts when images
are warped across multiple resolutions and by the vanishing problem in smaller
scene extents with higher motion contrast. Previously, we devised strategies
for building compact dense prediction networks guided by the effective
receptive field (ERF) characteristics of the network (DDCNet). The DDCNet
design was intentionally simple and compact allowing it to be used as a
building block for designing more complex yet compact networks. In this work,
we extend the DDCNet strategies to handle heterogeneous motion dynamics by
cascading DDCNet based sub-nets with decreasing extents of their ERF. Our

observe the basic characteristics of bulk states and current carrying edge
states. Here, we show that for quasicrystals in magnetic fields, there is also
a third option; the bulk localised transport states. These states share the
in-gap nature of the well-known edge states and can support transport along
them, but they are fully contained within the bulk of the system, with no
support along the edge. We consider both finite and infinite systems, using
rigorous error controlled computational techniques that are not prone to
finite-size effects. The bulk localised transport states are preserved for
infinite systems, in stark contrast to the normal edge states. This allows for
transport to be observed in infinite systems, without any perturbations,
defects, or boundaries being introduced. We confirm the in-gap topological
nature of the bulk localised transport states for finite and infinite systems
by computing common topological measures; namely the Bott index and local Chern
marker. The bulk localised transport states form due to a magnetic aperiodicity
arising from the interplay of length scales between the magnetic field and
quasiperiodic lattice. Bulk localised transport could have interesting
applications similar to those of the edge states on the boundary, but that
could now take advantage of the larger bulk of the lattice. The infinite size

investigate such connection with a suite of cosmological simulations of massive
(halo mass $\approx 10^{12}$ M$_{\odot}$) galaxies at $z\simeq 6$ which include
a detailed sub-grid multiphase gas and accretion model. BH seeds of initial
mass $10^5$ M$_{\odot}$ grow mostly by gas accretion, and become SMBH by $z=6$
setting on the observed $M_{\rm BH} - M_{\star}$ relation without the need for
a boost factor. Although quasar feedback crucially controls the SMBH growth,
its impact on the properties of the host galaxy at $z=6$ is negligible. In our
model, quasar activity can both quench (via gas heating) or enhance (by ISM
over-pressurization) star formation. However, we find that the star formation
history is insensitive to such modulation as it is largely dominated, at least
at $z>6$, by cold gas accretion from the environment that cannot be hindered by
the quasar energy deposition. Although quasar-driven outflows can achieve
velocities $> 1000~\rm km~s^{-1}$, only $\approx 4$% of the outflowing gas mass

how to analyze best such non-Gaussian fields, e.g. to infer the physical laws
that created them. This problem could be solved if a parametric non-Gaussian
sampling distribution for such fields were known, as this distribution could
serve as likelihood during inference. We therefore create a sampling
distribution for non-Gaussian random fields. Our approach is capable of
handling strong non-Gaussianity, while perturbative approaches such as the
Edgeworth expansion cannot. To imitate cosmological structure formation, we
enforce our fields to be (i) statistically isotropic, (ii) statistically
homogeneous, and (iii) statistically independent at large distances. We
generate such fields via a Monte Carlo Markov Chain technique and find that
even strong non-Gaussianity is not necessarily visible to the human eye. We
also find that sampled marginals for pixel pairs have an almost generic
Gauss-like appearance, even if the joint distribution of all pixels is markedly
non-Gaussian. This apparent Gaussianity is a consequence of the high
dimensionality of random fields. We conclude that vast amounts of non-Gaussian

main sequence, X-ray AGNs have similar median star formation (SF) properties,
but their incidence (q$_{\rm{AGN}}$) is higher among galaxies with either
enhanced or suppressed SF, and among galaxies with larger stellar mass surface
density, regardless if it is measured within half-light radius ($\Sigma_e$) or
central 1kpc ($\Sigma_{\rm{1kpc}}$). Unlike X-ray AGNs, IR AGNs are less
massive, and have enhanced SF and similar distributions of colors, $\Sigma_e$
and $\Sigma_{\rm{1kpc}}$ relative to non-AGN SFGs. Given that $\Sigma_e$ and
$\Sigma_{\rm{1kpc}}$ strongly correlate with M$_*$, we introduce the fractional
mass within central 1kpc ($\rm{\frac{M_{1kpc}}{M_*}}$), which only weakly
depends on M$_*$, to quantify galaxy compactness. Both AGN populations have
similar $\rm{\frac{M_{1kpc}}{M_*}}$ distributions compared to non-AGN SFGs'.
While q$_{\rm{AGN}}$ increases with $\Sigma_e$ and $\Sigma_{\rm{1kpc}}$, it
remains constant with $\rm{\frac{M_{1kpc}}{M_*}}$, indicating that the trend of
increasing q$_{\rm{AGN}}$ with $\rm{\Sigma}$ is driven by M$_*$ more than
morphology. While our findings are not in conflict with the scenario of AGN
quenching, they do not imply it either, because the incidence of AGNs hosted in
transitional galaxies depends crucially on AGN selections. Additionally,
despite the relatively large uncertainty of AGN bolometric luminosities, their
very weak correlation, if any, with SF activities, regardless of AGN
selections, also argues against a direct causal link between the presences of
AGNs and the quenching of massive galaxies at $z\sim2$.

infer the halo mass distribution of our groups binned in the two different
observable properties and constrain the power-law scaling relation, and the
scatter between mean halo masses and the two group observable properties. We
obtain a 5 percent constraint on the amplitude of the scaling relation between
halo mass and group luminosity with $\avg{M} = (0.81\pm
0.04)\times10^{14}\hinvMsun$ for $L_{\rm grp}=10^{11.5}\hinvsqLsun$, and a
power-law index of $\alpha=1.01\pm 0.07$. We constrain the amplitude of the
scaling relation between halo mass and velocity dispersion to be
$\avg{M}=(0.93\pm 0.05)\times10^{14}\hinvMsun$ for $\sigma=500 \kms$ and a
power-law index to be $\alpha=1.52\pm0.10$. However, these scaling relations
are sensitive to the exact cuts applied to the number of group members.
Comparisons with similar scaling relations from the literature show that our
results are consistent and have significantly reduced errors.

in strongly-disordered spin chains exhibiting many-body localization (MBL). We
distinguish between a finite-size/time MBL regime, and the asymptotic MBL
phase, and identify some ""landmarks"" within the MBL regime. Our first landmark
is an estimate of where the MBL phase becomes unstable to avalanches, obtained
by measuring the slowest relaxation rate of a finite chain coupled to an
infinite bath at one end. Our estimates indicate that the actual MBL-to-thermal
phase transition, in infinite-length systems, occurs much deeper in the MBL
regime than has been suggested by most previous studies. Our other landmarks
involve system-wide resonances. We find that the effective matrix elements
producing eigenstates with system-wide resonances are enormously broadly
distributed. This means that the onset of such resonances in typical samples
occurs quite deep in the MBL regime, and the first such resonances typically
involve rare pairs of eigenstates that are farther apart in energy than the
minimum gap. Thus we find that the resonance properties define two landmarks
that divide the MBL regime in to three subregimes: (i) at strongest disorder,
typical samples do not have any eigenstates that are involved in system-wide
many-body resonances; (ii) there is a substantial intermediate regime where
typical samples do have such resonances, but the pair of eigenstates with the
minimum spectral gap does not; and (iii) in the weaker randomness regime, the
minimum gap is involved in a many-body resonance and thus subject to level
repulsion. Nevertheless, even in this third subregime, all but a vanishing
fraction of eigenstates remain non-resonant and the system thus still appears
MBL in many respects. Based on our estimates of the location of the avalanche
instability, it might be that the MBL phase is only part of subregime (i).

spiral pattern, including arms, spurs, feathers, and branches. However, in our
own Milky Way, it has been challenging to connect individual star-forming
regions to their larger Galactic environment owing to our perspective from
within the disk. One feature in nearly all modern models of the Milky Way is
the Sagittarius Arm, located inward of the Sun with a pitch angle of ~12 deg.
Aims: We map the 3D locations and velocities of star-forming regions in a
segment of the Sagittarius Arm using young stellar objects (YSOs) from the
Spitzer/IRAC Candidate YSO (SPICY) catalog to compare their distribution to
models of the arm. Methods: Distances and velocities for these objects are
derived from Gaia EDR3 astrometry and molecular line surveys. We infer
parallaxes and proper motions for spatially clustered groups of YSOs and
estimate their radial velocities from the velocities of spatially associated
molecular clouds. Results: We identify 25 star-forming regions in the Galactic
longitude range l~4.0-18.5 deg arranged in a narrow, ~1 kpc long linear
structure with a high pitch angle of $\psi = 56$ deg and a high aspect ratio of
~7:1. This structure includes massive star-forming regions such as M8, M16,
M17, and M20. The motions in the structure are remarkably coherent, with
velocities in the direction of Galactic rotation of $240\pm3$ km/s (slightly
higher than average) and slight drifts toward the Galactic center (-4.3 km/s)
and in the negative Z direction (-2.9 km/s). The rotational shear experienced
by the structure is 4.6 km/s/kpc. Conclusions: The observed 56 deg pitch angle
is remarkably high for a segment of the Sagittarius Arm. We discuss possible
interpretations of this feature as a substructure within the lower pitch angle
Sagittarius Arm, as a spur, or as an isolated structure.

while subject to challenges in quantifying subtle systematic biases. The Point

second moments - is well studied, weak lensing systematics associated with
errors in higher moments of the PSF model require further investigation. The
goal of our study is to estimate their potential impact for LSST weak lensing
analysis. We go beyond second moments of the PSF by using image simulations to
relate multiplicative bias in shear to errors in the higher moments of the PSF
model. We find that the current level of errors in higher moments of the PSF
model in data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey can induce a $\sim 0.05 $
per cent shear bias, making this effect unimportant for ongoing surveys but
relevant at the precision of upcoming surveys such as LSST.

investigated the role of the metallicity in the dust formation process from a

measurement outcomes -- as predicted by quantum theory -- can be stronger than
that allowed by local causality, yet not fully constrained by the principle of
relativistic causality. In practice, the characterization of the set $Q$ of
quantum correlations is carried out, often, through a converging hierarchy of
outer approximations. On the other hand, some subsets of $Q$ arising from
additional constraints [e.g., originating from quantum states having
positive-partial-transposition (PPT) or being finite-dimensional maximally
entangled (MES)] turn out to be also amenable to similar numerical
characterizations. How, then, at a quantitative level, are all these naturally
restricted subsets of nonsignaling correlations different? Here, we consider
several bipartite Bell scenarios and numerically estimate their volume relative
to that of the set of nonsignaling correlations. Within the number of cases
investigated, we have observed that (1) for a given number of inputs $n_s$
(outputs $n_o$), the relative volume of both the Bell-local set and the quantum
set increases (decreases) rapidly with increasing $n_o$ ($n_s$) (2) although
the so-called macroscopically local set $Q_1$ may approximate $Q$ well in the
two-input scenarios, it can be a very poor approximation of the quantum set
when $n_s>n_o$ (3) the almost-quantum set $\tilde{Q}_1$ is an
exceptionally-good approximation to the quantum set (4) the difference between
$Q$ and the set of correlations originating from MES is most significant when
$n_o=2$, whereas (5) the difference between the Bell-local set and the PPT set
generally becomes more significant with increasing $n_o$. This last comparison,
in particular, allows us to identify Bell scenarios where there is little hope
of realizing the Bell violation by PPT states and those that deserve further
exploration.

string theory and mathematics. In this article we discuss a class of genus one
fibered Calabi-Yau threefolds with 5-sections from various perspectives. In
algebraic geometry, such Calabi-Yaus can be constructed as complete
intersections in Grassmannian fibrations and as Pfaffian varieties. These
constructions naturally fit into the framework of homological projective
duality and lead to dual pairs of Calabi-Yaus. From a physics perspective,
these spaces can be realised as low-energy configurations (""phases"") of gauged
linear sigma models (GLSMs) with non-Abelian gauge groups, where the dual
geometries arise as phases of the same GLSM. Using the modular bootstrap
approach of topological string theory, one can compute all-genus Gopakumar-Vafa
invariants of these Calabi-Yaus. We observe that homological projective duality
acts as an element of $\Gamma_0(5)$ on the topological string partition
function and the partition functions of dual geometries transform into each
other. Moreover, we study the geometries from an M-/F-theory perspective. We
compute the F-theory spectrum and show how the genus one-fibered Calabi-Yaus
are connected to certain Calabi-Yaus in toric varieties via a series of Higgs
transitions. Based on the F-theory physics, we conjecture that dual geometries
are elements of the same Tate-Shafarevich group. Our analysis also leads to a
classification of 5-section geometries, as well as the construction of F-theory
models with charge 5 hypermultiplets.

as centrifugal breakout for which there has been limited empirical evidence. In
this paper, we present data from TESS, LCO, ASAS-SN, and Veloce on the 45 Myr

detection of centrifugal breakout. In assessing this hypothesis, we examine the
sudden ($\sim$1-day timescale) disappearance of a previously stable
($\sim$1-month timescale) transit-like event. We also interpret the presence of
an anomalous brightening event that precedes the disappearance of the signal,
analyze rotational amplitudes and optical flaring as a proxy for magnetic
activity, and estimate the mass of gas and dust present immediately prior to
the potential breakout event. After demonstrating that our spectral and
photometric data support a magnetospheric clouds and centrifugal breakout model
and disfavor alternate scenarios, we discuss the possibility of a coronal mass
ejection (CME) or stellar wind origin of the corotating material and we
introduce a reionization mechanism as a potential explanation for more gradual
variations in eclipse parameters. Finally, after comparing TIC 234284556 with

suggest that while feedback, thermal and pressure smoothing effects influence
the clustering of Ly$\alpha$ absorbers at small scales, i.e $<0.5h^{-1}$ cMpc,
the HI photo-ionization rate ($\Gamma_{\rm HI}$) has a strong influence at all
scales. The strong redshift evolution of $\xi$ and $\zeta$ (for a fixed $N_{\rm

$N_{\rm HI}$ and baryon overdensity. Our simulation using best-fitted

observations at $z\sim 2$ but under-predicts the clustering at higher

non-equilibrium and inhomogeneous conditions prevailing during HeII

rotation of massive stars on the chemical yields and differential enrichment
according to the life-times of progenitor stars. We find that differential
enrichment has a significant impact on the early enrichment of the interstellar
medium which is translated into broader element ratio distributions,
particularly in the case of the oldest, most metal-poor stars. We find that the
[element/Fe] ratios of the $\alpha-$elements O, Mg and Si have systematically
lower scatter compared to the neutron-capture elements ratios Sr, Ba and Eu at
[Fe/H]$<-2$, which is $\sim 0.1-0.4$ dex for the former and between $\sim 0.5$

dependence of the chemical yields on the metallicity, mass and rotational

for the density fluctuations and the entanglement entropy of a one-dimensional
trapped Bose gas in the Tonks-Girardeau (TG) or hard-core limit, after a trap
quench from a double well to a single well. On the analytical side, the
quadratic nature of the theory of QGHD is complemented with the emerging
conformal invariance at the TG point to fix the universal part of those
quantities. Moreover, the well-known mapping of hard-core bosons to free
fermions, allows to use a generalized form of the Fisher-Hartwig conjecture to
fix the non-trivial spacetime dependence of the ultraviolet cutoff in the
entanglement entropy. The free nature of the TG gas also allows for more
accurate results on the numerical side, where a higher number of particles as
compared to the interacting case can be simulated. The agreement between
analytical and numerical predictions is extremely good. For the density
fluctuations, however, one has to average out large Friedel oscillations
present in the numerics to recover such agreement.

this theory, we study an analytic, asymptotically flat, and regular
(ultra-compact) black-hole solutions with non-trivial scalar hair of secondary
type. At first, we examine the properties of the static and spherically
symmetric black-hole solution -- firstly appeared in 1504.08209 [gr-qc] -- and
we find that in the causal region of the spacetime the stress-energy tensor,
needed to support our solution, satisfies the strong energy conditions. Then,
by using the slow-rotating approximation, we generalize the static solution
into a slowly rotating one, and we determine explicitly its angular velocity
$\omega(r)$. We also find that the angular velocity of our ultra-compact
solution is always larger compared to the angular velocity of the corresponding
equally massive slow-rotating Schwarzschild black hole. In addition, we
investigate the axial perturbations of the derived solutions by determining the
Schr\""{o}dinger-like equation and the effective potential. We show that there
is a region in the parameter space of the free parameters of our theory, which
allows for the existence of stable ultra-compact black hole solutions.
Specifically, we calculate that the most compact and stable black hole solution
is 0.551 times smaller than the Schwarzschild one, while it rotates 2.491 times
faster compared to the slow-rotating Schwarzschild black hole. Finally, we
present without going into details the generalization of the derived

Baseline Interferometry (VLBI), triggered by FRB detections from CHIME/FRB will
solve the challenge of localization for non-repeating events. Using a
refurbished 10-m radio dish at the Algonquin Radio Observatory located in
Ontario Canada, we developed a testbed for a VLBI experiment with a theoretical
~<30 masec precision. We provide an overview of the 10-m system and describe
its refurbishment, the data acquisition, and a procedure for fringe fitting
that simultaneously estimates the geometric delay used for localization and the
dispersive delay from the ionosphere. Using single pulses from the Crab pulsar,
we validate the system and localization procedure, and analyze the clock
stability between sites, which is critical for phase-referencing an FRB event.
We find a localization of 50 masec is possible with the performance of the
current system. Furthermore, for sources with insufficient signal or restricted
wideband to simultaneously measure both geometric and ionospheric delays, we
show that the differential ionospheric contribution between the two sites must
be measured to a precision of 1e-8 pc/cc to provide a reasonable localization
from a detection in the 400--800 MHz band. Finally we show detection of an FRB
observed simultaneously in the CHIME and the Algonquin 10-m telescope, the

theoretical description of the coupled atom-cavity dynamics we analyze the
stationary atomic configurations including a superradiant phase where the atoms
undergo continuous monochromatic collective emission. In addition, we derive an
analytical formula for the cavity pulling coefficient which characterizes the
displacement of the emission frequency towards the cavity frequency. We find
that the pulling is small if the cavity linewidth is much larger than the
collective linewidth of the atomic beam. This regime is desired for building
stable lasers because the emission frequency is robust against cavity length
fluctuations. Furthermore, we investigate the stability of the atomic phases
and compare our theoretical predictions with numerical results. Remarkably, we
also find polychromatic emission regimes, where the spectrum has several
frequency components while the light output is still superradiant.

general relativity and quantum mechanics. However, the assumptions leading to
the problem are often overlooked and, in fact, a careful inspection of the main
hypothesises suggests a radical reformulation of the problem. Indeed, we
present a thought experiment involving a black hole that emits radiation and,
independently of the nature of the radiation, we show the existence of an
incompatibility between (i) the validity of the laws of general relativity to
describe infalling matter far from the Planckian regime, and (ii) the so-called
central dogma which states that as seen from an outside observer a black hole
behaves like a quantum system whose number of degrees of freedom is
proportional to the horizon area. We critically revise the standard arguments
in support of the central dogma, and argue that they cannot hold true unless
some new physics is invoked even before reaching Planck scales. This suggests
that the information loss problem, in its current formulation, is not
necessarily related to any loss of information or lack of unitarity. Therefore,
in principle, semiclassical general relativity and quantum mechanics can be
perfectly compatible before reaching the final stage of the black hole
evaporation where, instead, a consistent theory of quantum gravity is needed to
make any prediction.

and modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) because it works differently in these
frameworks. This concept, however, has yet to be explored very much with MOND.
Previous simulations showed weaker dynamical friction during major mergers for
MOND than for Newtonian gravity with dark matter. Analytic arguments suggest
the opposite for minor mergers. In this work, we verify the analytic
predictions for MOND by high-resolution $N$-body simulations of globular
clusters (GCs) moving in isolated ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). We test the
MOND analog of the Chandrasekhar formula for the dynamical friction proposed by
S\'anchez-Salcedo on a single GC. We also explore whether MOND allows GC
systems of isolated UDGs to survive without sinking into nuclear star clusters.
The simulations are run using the adaptive-mesh-refinement code Phantom of
Ramses. The mass resolution is $20\,M_\odot$ and the spatial resolution
$50\,$pc. The GCs are modeled as point masses. Simulations including a single
GC reveal that, as long as the apocenter of the GC is over about 0.5 effective
radii, the S\'anchez-Salcedo formula works excellently, with an effective
Coulomb logarithm increasing with orbital circularity. Once the GC reaches the
central kiloparsec, its sinking virtually stops, likely because of the core
stalling mechanism. In simulations with multiple GCs, many of them sink toward
the center, but the core stalling effect seems to prevent them from forming a
nuclear star cluster. The GC system ends up with a lower velocity dispersion
than the stars of the galaxy. By scaling the simulations, we extend these
results to most UDG parameters, as long as these UDGs are not external-field
dominated.

exhibit various types of non-equilibrium phase transitions, arising from the
competition between unitary evolution and measurements. Dissipative phase
transitions in steady states of time-independent Liouvillians and measurement
induced phase transitions at the level of quantum trajectories are two primary
examples of such transitions. Investigating a many-body spin system subject to
periodic resetting measurements, we argue that many-body dissipative Floquet
dynamics provides a natural framework to analyze both types of transitions. We
show that a dissipative phase transition between a ferromagnetic ordered phase
and a paramagnetic disordered phase emerges for long-range systems as a
function of measurement probabilities. A measurement induced transition of the
entanglement entropy between volume law scaling and sub-volume law scaling is
also present, and is distinct from the ordering transition. The two phases
correspond to an error-correcting and a quantum-Zeno regimes, respectively. The
ferromagnetic phase is lost for short range interactions, while the volume law
phase of the entanglement is enhanced. An analysis of multifractal properties
of wave function in Hilbert space provides a common perspective on both types
of transitions in the system. Our findings are immediately relevant to trapped

algorithms for data analysis. A crucial step in sketching methods is to compute
a subspace embedding (SE) for a large matrix $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{N

solutions for many linear-algebraic tasks, such as least squares regression and
low rank approximation. Computing an SE often requires an explicit
representation of $\mathbf{A}$ and running time proportional to the size of
$\mathbf{A}$. However, if $\mathbf{A}= \mathbf{T}_1 \Join \mathbf{T}_2 \Join
\dots \Join \mathbf{T}_m$ is the result of a database join query on several
smaller tables $\mathbf{T}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{n_i \times d_i}$, then this
running time can be prohibitive, as $\mathbf{A}$ itself can have as many as
$O(n_1 n_2 \cdots n_m)$ rows.
  In this work, we design subspace embeddings for database joins which can be
computed significantly faster than computing the join. For the case of a two
table join $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{T}_1 \Join \mathbf{T}_2$ we give
input-sparsity algorithms for computing subspace embeddings, with running time
bounded by the number of non-zero entries in $\mathbf{T}_1,\mathbf{T}_2$. This
results in input-sparsity time algorithms for high accuracy regression,
significantly improving upon the running time of prior FAQ-based methods for
regression. We extend our results to arbitrary joins for the ridge regression
problem, also considerably improving the running time of prior methods.
Empirically, we apply our method to real datasets and show that it is
significantly faster than existing algorithms.

XMM-Newton archival observation in 2003 also showed signatures of partial

the ionizing flux varies. We found that up to four warm absorber (WA)

(log xi ranging between 0.2 and 0.5) obscuring (log N(H) of about 22.3) wind
outflowing at about 6000 km/s. The absorbers have a log N(H) ranging from 21 to
about 22.5, and ionization parameters ranging from 1.6 to 2.9. The most ionized
component is also the fastest, moving away at 5100 km/s, while the others
outflow in two kinematic regimes, at about 600 and 350 km/s. These components
showed variability at different time scales in response to changes in the
ionizing continuum. Assuming that these changes are due to photoionization we
have obtained upper and lower limits on the density of the gas and therefore on
its distance, finding that the closest two components are at pc-scale
distances, while the rest may extend up to tens of pc from the central source.
The fastest, most ionized WA component accounts for the bulk of the kinetic
luminosity injected back into the ISM of the host galaxy, which is on the order
of 0.8% of the bolometric luminosity of NGC 985. According to the models, this

where a group of threads-wavefront or warp-execute instructions in lockstep.
When threads in a group encounter a branching instruction, not all threads in
the group take the same path, a phenomenon known as control-flow divergence.
The control-flow divergence causes performance degradation because both paths
of the branch must be executed one after the other. Prior research has
primarily addressed this issue through architectural modifications. We observe
that certain GPGPU kernels with control-flow divergence have similar
control-flow structures with similar instructions on both sides of a branch.
This structure can be exploited to reduce control-flow divergence by melding
the two sides of the branch allowing threads to reconverge early, reducing
divergence. In this work, we present DARM, a compiler analysis and
transformation framework that can meld divergent control-flow structures with
similar instruction sequences. We show that DARM can reduce the performance
degradation from control-flow divergence.

Though weaker than current astrophysical bounds, the laboratory limits (and

complementary probe of the dark matter properties. We point out that current

through targeted labeling, enabling significant labeling cost savings. As most
research on active learning has been carried out before transformer-based
language models (""transformers"") became popular, despite its practical
importance, comparably few papers have investigated how transformers can be
combined with active learning to date. This can be attributed to the fact that
using state-of-the-art query strategies for transformers induces a prohibitive
runtime overhead, which effectively nullifies, or even outweighs the desired
cost savings. For this reason, we revisit uncertainty-based query strategies,
which had been largely outperformed before, but are particularly suited in the
context of fine-tuning transformers. In an extensive evaluation, we connect
transformers to experiments from previous research, assessing their performance
on five widely used text classification benchmarks. For active learning with
transformers, several other uncertainty-based approaches outperform the

in the ultra-faint dwarf (UFD) galaxy Centaurus I (CenI) and two Milky Way (MW)
$\delta$ Scuti/SX Phoenicis stars based on multi-epoch $giz$ DECam

radius (r$_h$) of Cen I, while the RRab star (CenI-V3) is at $\sim6$ r$_h$. The
presence of three distant RRL stars clustered this tightly in space represents
a 4.7$\sigma$ excess relative to the smooth distribution of RRL in the Galactic
halo. Using the newly detected RRL stars, we obtain a distance modulus to Cen I
of $\mu_0 = 20.354 \pm 0.002$ mag ($\sigma=0.03$ mag), a heliocentric distance
of D$_\odot = 117.7 \pm 0.1$ kpc ($\sigma=1.6$ kpc), with systematic errors of
$0.07$ mag and $4$ kpc. The location of the Cen I RRL stars in the Bailey

Finally, we study the relative rate of RRc+RRd (RRcd) stars ($f_{cd}$) in UFD
and classical dwarf galaxies. The full sample of MW dwarf galaxies gives a mean
of $f_{cd} = 0.28$. While several UFD galaxies, such as Cen I, present higher
RRcd ratios, if we combine the RRL populations of all UFD galaxies, the RRcd
ratio is similar to the one obtained for the classical dwarfs ($f_{cd}$ $\sim$
0.3). Therefore, there is no evidence for a different fraction of RRcd stars in
UFD and classical dwarf galaxies.

dark matter halos are correlated with their nearby large-scale environment. As
structure formation on different scales is strongly coupled, it is trick to
disentangle the formation of halo with the large-scale environment, making it
difficult to infer which is the driving force for the correlation between halo
spin/shape with the large-scale structure. In this paper, we use N-body
simulation to produce twin Universes that share the same initial conditions on
small scales but different on large scales. This is achieved by changing the
random seeds for the phase of those k modes smaller than a given scale in the
initial conditions. In this way, we are able to disentangle the formation of
halo and large-scale structure, making it possible to investigate how halo spin
and shape correspond to the change of environment on large scales. We identify
matching halo pairs in the twin simulations as those sharing the maximum number
of identical particles within each other. Using these matched halo pairs, we
study the cross match of halo spin and their correlation with the large-scale
structure. It is found that when the large-scale environment changes
(eigenvector) between the twin simulations, the halo spin has to rotate
accordingly, although not significantly, to maintain the universal correlation
seen in each simulation. Our results suggest that the large-scale structure is
the main factor to drive the correlation between halo properties and their
environment.

case of the combinatorial auction in which (i) each of the $m$ items in the
auction is an edge of some underlying graph; and (ii) each of the $n$ buyers is
single-minded and only interested in buying all edges of a single path. We
consider the competitive ratio between the hindsight optimal welfare and the
optimal worst-case welfare among all item-pricing mechanisms, when the order of
the arriving buyers is adversarial. We assume that buyers own the
\emph{tie-breaking} power, i.e. they can choose whether or not to buy the
demand path at 0 utility. We prove a tight competitive ratio of $3/2$ when the
underlying graph is a single path (also known as the \emph{highway} problem),
whereas item-pricing can achieve the hindsight optimal if the seller is allowed
to choose a proper tie-breaking rule to maximize the welfare. Moreover, we
prove an $O(1)$ upper bound of competitive ratio when the underlying graph is a

  For general graphs, we prove an $\Omega(m^{1/8})$ lower bound of the

unavoidable even if the graph is a grid, or if the capacity of every edge is
augmented by a constant factor $c$. The results hold even if the seller has

This is
based on projective measurements on states of $2n+1$ separable bases or $2$

measurement bases scales as $O(n)$ and $O(1)$, respectively. Thereby, the
proposed method exhibits a very favorable scaling in the number of qubits when
compared to other estimation methods. Monte Carlo numerical experiments show
that the method can achieve a high estimation fidelity. For instance, an
average fidelity of $0.88$ on the Hilbert space of $10$ qubits is achieved with
$21$ separable bases. The use of separable bases makes our estimation method
particularly well suited for applications in noisy intermediate-scale quantum
computers, where entangling gates are much less accurate than local gates. We
experimentally demonstrate the proposed method in one of IBM's quantum
processors by estimating 4-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states with a
fidelity close to $0.875$ via separable bases. Other $10$-qubit separable and

coset states (first introduced by Aaronson and Christiano [STOC '12]). This
notion was considered independently by Vidick and Zhang [Eurocrypt '21], in the
context of proofs of quantum knowledge from quantum money schemes. We explore
unclonable properties of coset states and several applications:
  - We show that assuming indistinguishability obfuscation (iO), hidden coset
states possess a certain direct product hardness property, which immediately
implies a tokenized signature scheme in the plain model. Previously, it was
known only relative to an oracle, from a work of Ben-David and Sattath [QCrypt
'17].
  - Combining a tokenized signature scheme with extractable witness encryption,
we give a construction of an unclonable decryption scheme in the plain model.
The latter primitive was recently proposed by Georgiou and Zhandry [ePrint
'20], who gave a construction relative to a classical oracle.
  - We conjecture that coset states satisfy a certain natural
(information-theoretic) monogamy-of-entanglement property. Assuming this
conjecture is true, we remove the requirement for extractable witness
encryption in our unclonable decryption construction, by relying instead on
compute-and-compare obfuscation for the class of unpredictable distributions.
This conjecture was later proved by Culf and Vidick in a follow-up work.
  - Finally, we give a construction of a copy-protection scheme for
pseudorandom functions (PRFs) in the plain model. Our scheme is secure either
assuming iO, OWF, and extractable witness encryption, or assuming iO, OWF,
compute-and-compare obfuscation for the class of unpredictable distributions,
and the conjectured monogamy property mentioned above. This is the first
example of a copy-protection scheme with provable security in the plain model
for a class of functions that is not evasive.

spectrum, which is absorbed by the gauge field, and anti-phase oscillations
with the energy gap (mass) in the spectrum determined by the interband
coupling, which can be associated with the Leggett mode. The Higgs mode splits
into two branches also: a massive one, whose energy gap vanishes at the
critical temperature $T_{c}$, another massive one, whose energy gap does not
vanish at $T_{c}$. It is demonstrated, that the second branch of the Higgs mode
is nonphysical, and it, together with the Leggett mode, can be removed by the
special choice of coefficient at the ""drag"" term in the Lagrangian. In the same
time, such a choice leaves only one coherence length, thereby prohibiting
so-called type-1.5 superconductors. We analyze experimental data about the
Josephson effect between two-band superconductors. In particular, it is
demonstrated, that the resonant enhancement of the DC current through a
Josephson junction at a resonant bias voltage $V_{\mathrm{res}}$, when the
Josephson frequency matches the frequency of some internal oscillation mode in

thermodynamics plays in shaping these structures and their ensuing functions.
Here, we unravel how a fundamental thermodynamic connection between the
physical energy dissipation sustaining a nonequilibrium system and a measure of
statistical irreversibility (arrow of time), can provide quantitative insight
into the mechanisms of nonequilibrium activity across scales. Specifically, we
introduce a multiscale irreversibility metric and demonstrate how it can be
used to extract model-independent estimates of dissipative timescales. Using
this metric, we measure the dissipation timescale of a multiscale cellular
structure - the actomyosin cortex - and further observe that the
irreversibility metric maintains a monotonic relationship with the underlying
biological nonequilibrium activity. Additionally, the irreversibility metric
can detect shifts in the dissipative timescales when we induce spatiotemporal
patterns of biochemical signaling proteins upstream of actomyosin activation.
Our experimental measurements are complemented by a theoretical analysis of a
generic class of nonequilibrium dynamics, elucidating how dissipative
timescales manifest in multiscale irreversibility.

evolution of compact-object binaries. They typically rely on analytical fits of
single-star evolutionary tracks and parameterized models for interactive phases
of evolution (e.g., mass-transfer on thermal timescale, determination of
dynamical instability, and common envelope) that are crucial to predict the
fate of binaries. These processes can be more carefully implemented in stellar
structure and evolution codes such as MESA. To assess the impact of such
improvements, we compare binary black hole mergers as predicted in models with
the rapid binary population synthesis code COSMIC to models ran with MESA
simulations through mass transfer and common-envelope treatment. We find that
results significantly differ in terms of formation paths, the orbital periods
and mass ratios of merging binary black holes, and consequently merger rates.
While common-envelope evolution is the dominant formation channel in COSMIC,
stable mass transfer dominates in our MESA models. Depending upon the black
hole donor mass, and mass-transfer and common-envelope physics, at sub-solar
metallicity COSMIC overproduces the number of binary black hole mergers by
factors of 2--35 with a significant fraction of them having merger times orders
of magnitude shorter than the binary black holes formed when using detailed
MESA models. Therefore we find that some binary black hole merger rate
predictions from rapid population syntheses of isolated binaries may be
overestimated by factors of ~5--500. We conclude that the interpretation of
gravitational-wave observations requires the use of detailed treatment of these

surfaces owing to the inherent flexibility of interlooped yarns and recent
advances in manufacturing providing better control of local stitch patterns.
Fully yarn-level modelling of large-scale knitted membranes is not feasible.
Therefore, we use a two-scale homogenisation approach and model the membrane as
a Kirchhoff-Love shell on the macroscale and as Euler-Bernoulli rods on the
microscale. The governing equations for both the shell and the rod are
discretised with cubic B-spline basis functions. For homogenisation we consider
only the in-plane response of the membrane. The solution of the nonlinear
microscale problem requires a significant amount of time due to the large
deformations and the enforcement of contact constraints, rendering conventional
online computational homogenisation approaches infeasible. To sidestep this
problem, we use a pre-trained statistical Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
model to map the macroscale deformations to macroscale stresses. During the
offline learning phase, the GPR model is trained by solving the microscale
problem for a sufficiently rich set of deformation states obtained by either
uniform or Sobol sampling. The trained GPR model encodes the nonlinearities and
anisotropies present in the microscale and serves as a material model for the
membrane response of the macroscale shell. The bending response can be chosen
in dependence of the mesh size to penalise the fine out-of-plane wrinkling of
the membrane. After verifying and validating the different components of the
proposed approach, we introduce several examples involving membranes subjected
to tension and shear to demonstrate its versatility and good performance.

increasingly touted as a powerful tool to alter the fundamental properties of

can be used to rewrite molecular potential energy landscapes and redirect
photophysical pathways, with applications from catalysis to electronic devices.
Crucial to their photophysical properties is the exchange of energy between
coherent, bright polaritons and incoherent dark states. One of the most potent
tools to explore this interplay is transient absorption/reflectance
spectroscopy. Previous studies have revealed unexpectedly long lifetimes of the
coherent polariton states, for which there is no theoretical explanation.
Applying these transient methods to a series of strong-coupled organic
microcavities, we recover similar long-lived spectral effects. Based on
transfer-matrix modelling of the transient experiment, we find that virtually
the entire photoresponse results from photoexcitation effects other than the
generation of polariton states. Our results suggest that the complex optical
properties of polaritonic systems make them especially prone to misleading
optical signatures, and that more challenging high-time-resolution measurements
on high-quality microcavities are necessary to uniquely distinguish the
coherent polariton dynamics.

information in noisy environments is a key and challenging goal. A stimulating,
though controversial, hypothesis poses that operating in dynamical regimes near
the edge of a phase transition, i.e. at criticality or the ""edge of chaos"", can
provide information-processing living systems with important operational
advantages, creating, e.g., an optimal trade-off between robustness and
flexibility. Here, we elaborate on a recent theoretical result, which
establishes that the spectrum of covariance matrices of neural networks
representing complex inputs in a robust way needs to decay as a power-law of
the rank, with an exponent close to unity, a result that has been indeed
experimentally verified in neurons of the mouse visual cortex. Aimed at
understanding and mimicking these results, we construct an artificial neural
network and train it to classify images. Remarkably, we find that the best
performance in such a task is obtained when the network operates near the
critical point, at which the eigenspectrum of the covariance matrix follows the
very same statistics as actual neurons do. Thus, we conclude that operating
near criticality can also have -- besides the usually alleged virtues -- the
advantage of allowing for flexible, robust and efficient input representations.

the quantum state space by a Fourier transform guaranteed by the Pontryagin

quantum condition space offers a novel perspective of understanding quantum
states with the duality picture. In addition, the quantum conditions have
physical meanings and realizations of their own and thus may be studied for
purposes beyond the original motivation of characterizing events for
probability evaluation. Finally, the relation between the condition space and

minimum-size set of paths that together cover all the vertices of the DAG.
Computing an MPC is a basic polynomial problem, dating back to Dilworth's and
Fulkerson's results in the 1950s. Since the size $k$ of an MPC (also known as
the width) can be small in practical applications, research has also studied
algorithms whose complexity is parameterized on $k$. We obtain two new MPC
parameterized algorithms for DAGs running in time $O(k^2|V|\log{|V|} + |E|)$
and $O(k^3|V| + |E|)$. We also obtain a parallel algorithm running in $O(k^2|V|
+ |E|)$ parallel steps and using $O(\log{|V|})$ processors (in the PRAM model).
Our latter two algorithms are the first solving the problem in parameterized
linear time. Finally, we present an algorithm running in time $O(k^2|V|)$ for
transforming any MPC to another MPC using less than $2|V|$ distinct edges,
which we prove to be asymptotically tight. As such, we also obtain edge
sparsification algorithms preserving the width of the DAG with the same running
time as our MPC algorithms. At the core of all our algorithms we interleave the
usage of three techniques: transitive sparsification, shrinking of a path
cover, and the splicing of a set of paths along a given path.

This duality structure is more general than that of a rigid monoidal category;
in contrast to rigidity, it naturally accommodates the fact that a vertex
operator algebra and its gradewise dual need not be isomorphic as modules and
that the tensor product of modules over vertex operator algebras need not be
exact.

machine learning provider can convey confidence to decision-makers by
guaranteeing their predictions are distribution calibrated -- amongst the
inputs that receive a predicted class probabilities vector $q$, the actual
distribution over classes is $q$. For multi-class prediction problems, however,
achieving distribution calibration tends to be infeasible, requiring sample
complexity exponential in the number of classes $C$. In this work, we introduce
a new notion -- \emph{decision calibration} -- that requires the predicted
distribution and true distribution to be ``indistinguishable'' to a set of
downstream decision-makers. When all possible decision makers are under
consideration, decision calibration is the same as distribution calibration.
However, when we only consider decision makers choosing between a bounded
number of actions (e.g. polynomial in $C$), our main result shows that
decisions calibration becomes feasible -- we design a recalibration algorithm

investigate two generic mechanochemical models where the deformations of a thin
elastic sheet are driven by, and in turn affect, the concentration gradients of
a chemical signal. We develop numerical methods to study the coupled elastic

computations the formation of different patterns depending on shell thickness,
strength of mechanochemical coupling and diffusivity. In the first model, the
sheet curvature governs the production of a contractility inhibitor and
depending on the threshold in the coupling, qualitatively different patterns
occur. The second model is based on the stress--dependent activity of myosin
motors, and demonstrates how the concentration distribution patterns of
molecular motors are affected by the long-range deformations generated by them.
Since the propagation of mechanical deformations is typically faster than
chemical kinetics (of molecular motors or signaling agents that affect motors),
we describe in detail and implement a numerical method based on separation of
timescales to effectively simulate such systems. We show that mechanochemical
coupling leads to long-range propagation of patterns in disparate systems

which are not found in univariate functional data. One of these is a situation
where the component functions of multivariate functional data are positive and
are subject to mutual time warping. That is, the component processes exhibit a
common shape but are subject to systematic phase variation across their domains
in addition to subject-specific time warping, where each subject has its own
internal clock. This motivates a novel model for multivariate functional data
that connects such mutual time warping to a latent deformation-based framework
by exploiting a novel time warping separability assumption. This separability
assumption allows for meaningful interpretation and dimension reduction. The
resulting Latent Deformation Model is shown to be well suited to represent
commonly encountered functional vector data. The proposed approach combines a
random amplitude factor for each component with population based registration
across the components of a multivariate functional data vector and includes a
latent population function, which corresponds to a common underlying

implementation of the proposed data-based representation for multivariate

entanglement scaling of short-range restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) quantum

$\alpha$. We study the nature of the transition between these regions, finding
numerical evidence for critical behavior. Our work establishes the presence of

without any supervision, our algorithm, SoftHebb, minimizes cross-entropy, i.e.

SoftHebb shows advantages beyond its Hebbian efficiency. Namely, it converges
in fewer iterations, and is significantly more robust to noise and adversarial

the human eye, potentially linking human perceptual robustness, with Hebbian

mass of the structures, and the distance from the center of a galaxy. For the
most complete surveys of structures in the Galaxy defined by CO $J = 1-0$, the
fraction of mass that is in bound structures is 0.19. For catalogs of other
galaxies based on CO $J = 2-1$, the fraction is 0.35. These results offer
substantial alleviation of the fundamental problem of slow star formation. If
only clouds found to be bound are counted and they are assumed to collapse in a
free-fall time at their mean cloud density, the sum over all clouds in a
complete survey of the Galaxy yields a predicted star formation rate of 46
solar masses per year, a factor of 6.5 less than if all clouds are bound.

both basic nuclear physics and applications. While the proton light yield of
organic scintillators has been extensively studied, measurements of the light
yield from neutron interactions with carbon nuclei are scarce. Purpose:
Demonstrate a new approach for the simultaneous measurement of the proton and
carbon light yield of organic scintillators. Provide new carbon light yield
data for the EJ-309 liquid and EJ-204 plastic organic scintillators. Method: A
33~MeV $^{2}$H$^{+}$ beam from the 88-Inch Cyclotron at Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory was impinged upon a 3-mm-thick Be target to produce a
high-flux, broad-spectrum neutron beam. The double time-of-flight technique was
extended to simultaneously measure the proton and carbon light yield of the
organic scintillators, wherein the light output associated with the recoil
particle was determined using $np$ and $n$C elastic scattering kinematics.
Results: The proton and carbon light yield relations of the EJ-309 liquid and
EJ-204 plastic organic scintillators were measured over a recoil energy range
of approximately 0.3 to 1~MeV and 2 to 5~MeV, respectively for EJ-309, and 0.2
to 0.5~MeV and 1 to 4~MeV, respectively for EJ-204. Conclusions: These data
provide new insight into the ionization quenching effect in organic
scintillators and key input for simulation of the response of organic
scintillators for both basic science and a broad range of applications.

has a variety of applications, especially in learning and searching algorithms.
In particular, the Bayesian update method is a well known version of MWU that
is particularly applicable for the problem of searching in a given domain. An
ideal scenario for that method is when the input distribution is known a priori
and each single update maximizes the information gain. In this work we consider
two search domains - linear orders (sorted arrays) and graphs, where the aim of
the search is to locate an unknown target by performing as few queries as
possible. Searching such domains is well understood when each query provides a
correct answer and the input target distribution is uniform. Hence, we consider
two generalizations: the noisy search both with arbitrary and adversarial
(i.e., unknown) target distributions. We obtain several results providing full
characterization of the query complexities in the three settings: adversarial
Monte Carlo, adversarial Las Vegas and distributional Las Vegas. Our algorithms
either improve, simplify or patch earlier ambiguities in the literature - see
the works of Emamjomeh-Zadeh et al. [STOC 2016], Dereniowski et. al. [SOSA@SODA

strategies that provide the optimal number of queries up to lower-order terms.
Our technical contribution lies in providing generic search techniques that are
able to deal with the fact that, in general, queries guarantee only suboptimal
information gain.

to state-of-the-art image classifiers. However, real-life scenarios resemble
more the black-box adversarial conditions, lacking transparency and usually
imposing natural, hard constraints on the query budget.
  We propose $\textbf{EvoBA}$, a black-box adversarial attack based on a
surprisingly simple evolutionary search strategy. $\textbf{EvoBA}$ is
query-efficient, minimizes $L_0$ adversarial perturbations, and does not
require any form of training.
  $\textbf{EvoBA}$ shows efficiency and efficacy through results that are in
line with much more complex state-of-the-art black-box attacks such as
$\textbf{AutoZOOM}$. It is more query-efficient than $\textbf{SimBA}$, a simple
and powerful baseline black-box attack, and has a similar level of complexity.
Therefore, we propose it both as a new strong baseline for black-box
adversarial attacks and as a fast and general tool for gaining empirical
insight into how robust image classifiers are with respect to $L_0$ adversarial
perturbations.
  There exist fast and reliable $L_2$ black-box attacks, such as
$\textbf{SimBA}$, and $L_{\infty}$ black-box attacks, such as
$\textbf{DeepSearch}$. We propose $\textbf{EvoBA}$ as a query-efficient $L_0$
black-box adversarial attack which, together with the aforementioned methods,
can serve as a generic tool to assess the empirical robustness of image
classifiers. The main advantages of such methods are that they run fast, are
query-efficient, and can easily be integrated in image classifiers development
pipelines.
  While our attack minimises the $L_0$ adversarial perturbation, we also report
$L_2$, and notice that we compare favorably to the state-of-the-art $L_2$
black-box attack, $\textbf{AutoZOOM}$, and of the $L_2$ strong baseline,
$\textbf{SimBA}$.

switching and resource allocation considering the dynamics of the wildfire and
failure propagation. However, possible number of line- and load-switching in a
large system during an event make traditional prediction-driven and stochastic
approaches computationally intractable, leading operators to often use greedy
algorithms. We model and solve the proactive control problem as a Markov
decision process and introduce an integrated testbed for spatio-temporal
wildfire propagation and proactive power-system operation. We transform the
enormous wildfire-propagation observation space and utilize it as part of a
heuristic for proactive de-energization of transmission assets. We integrate
this heuristic with a reinforcement-learning based proactive policy for
controlling the generating assets. Our approach allows this controller to
provide setpoints for a part of the generation fleet, while a myopic operator

further introduce variational random features to learn a data-driven kernel for

is inferred from the coreset of each task. In this way, we are able to generate
more informative kernels specific to each task, and, more importantly, the

OpTuner assembles dozens of implementations for the standard mathematical

Specifically, our work establishes a novel connection between strategic
responses to ML models and instrumental variable (IV) regression by observing
that the sequence of deployed models can be viewed as an instrument that
affects agents' observable features but does not directly influence their
outcomes. We show that our causal recovery method can be utilized to improve
decision-making across several important criteria: individual fairness, agent
outcomes, and predictive risk. In particular, we show that if decision subjects

deviating from the causal coefficients can lead to (potentially unbounded)
individual-level unfairness.

multinomial counts of $p$ words across $n$ independent documents. In topic
models, the $p\times n$ expected word frequency matrix is assumed to be
factorized as a $p\times K$ word-topic matrix $A$ and a $K\times n$
topic-document matrix $T$. Since columns of both matrices represent conditional
probabilities belonging to probability simplices, columns of $A$ are viewed as
$p$-dimensional mixture components that are common to all documents while
columns of $T$ are viewed as the $K$-dimensional mixture weights that are
document specific and are allowed to be sparse. The main interest is to provide
sharp, finite sample, $\ell_1$-norm convergence rates for estimators of the
mixture weights $T$ when $A$ is either known or unknown. For known $A$, we
suggest MLE estimation of $T$. Our non-standard analysis of the MLE not only
establishes its $\ell_1$ convergence rate, but reveals a remarkable property:
the MLE, with no extra regularization, can be exactly sparse and contain the
true zero pattern of $T$. We further show that the MLE is both minimax optimal
and adaptive to the unknown sparsity in a large class of sparse topic
distributions. When $A$ is unknown, we estimate $T$ by optimizing the
likelihood function corresponding to a plug in, generic, estimator $\hat{A}$ of
$A$. For any estimator $\hat{A}$ that satisfies carefully detailed conditions
for proximity to $A$, the resulting estimator of $T$ is shown to retain the
properties established for the MLE. The ambient dimensions $K$ and $p$ are
allowed to grow with the sample sizes. Our application is to the estimation of
1-Wasserstein distances between document generating distributions. We propose,
estimate and analyze new 1-Wasserstein distances between two probabilistic

effective for sequence modeling. However, the key limitation of transformers is
their quadratic memory and time complexity $\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ with respect to
the sequence length in attention layers, which restricts application in
extremely long sequences. Most existing approaches leverage sparsity or
low-rank assumptions in the attention matrix to reduce cost, but sacrifice
expressiveness. Instead, we propose Combiner, which provides full attention
capability in each attention head while maintaining low computation and memory
complexity. The key idea is to treat the self-attention mechanism as a
conditional expectation over embeddings at each location, and approximate the
conditional distribution with a structured factorization. Each location can
attend to all other locations, either via direct attention, or through indirect
attention to abstractions, which are again conditional expectations of
embeddings from corresponding local regions. We show that most sparse attention
patterns used in existing sparse transformers are able to inspire the design of
such factorization for full attention, resulting in the same sub-quadratic cost
($\mathcal{O}(L\log(L))$ or $\mathcal{O}(L\sqrt{L})$). Combiner is a drop-in
replacement for attention layers in existing transformers and can be easily
implemented in common frameworks. An experimental evaluation on both
autoregressive and bidirectional sequence tasks demonstrates the effectiveness
of this approach, yielding state-of-the-art results on several image and text
modeling tasks.

two Meissner solids and a body with tetrahedral symmetry that we have called

(LSS) of the Universe at redshifts where few other observations are available,
by solving the inversion problem (IP) consisting in reconstructing the LSS from
its effects on the observed luminosity distance. So far the IP was solved
assuming some restrictions about space-time, such as spherical symmetry for
example, while we obtain for the first time solutions of the IP problem for
arbitrary space-time geometries using deep learning. The method is based on the
use of convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained on simulated data. The
training data set is obtained by first generating random density and velocity
fields, and then computing their effects on the luminosity distance. The CNN,
based on an appriately modified version of U-Net to account for the
tridimensionality of the data, is then trained to reconstruct the density and
velocity fields from the luminosity distance.
  We find that the velocity field inversion is more accurate than the density
field, because the effects of the velocity on the luminosity distance only
depend on the source velocity, while in the case of the density it is an
integrated effect along the line of sight, giving rise to more degeneracy in
the solution of the IP. Improved versions of these neural networks, modified to
accommodate the non uniform distribution of the SNe, can be applied to
observational data to reconstruct the large scale structure of the Universe at
redshifts at which few other observations are available.

We characterize the Hamming weight distribution of PR codes and their duals and
show that for a properly chosen primitive polynomial, the Hamming weight

codes and show that there always exists a PR code that can meet this bound for
any desired codeword length. We provide a list of primitive polynomials for
message lengths up to $40$ and show that the respective PR codes closely meet
the Gilbert-Varshamov bound at various rates. Simulation results show that PR

Our analysis confirms that multitask learning tends to generate similar decoder

the pretrained text translation modules. We observe minimal negative transfer
effect between the two tasks and sharing more parameters is helpful to transfer
knowledge from the text task to the speech task. The analysis also reveals that
the modality representation difference at the top decoder layers is still not
negligible, and those layers are critical for the translation quality. Inspired

First, a parameter sharing and initialization strategy is proposed to enhance
information sharing between the tasks. Second, a novel attention-based
regularization is proposed for the encoders and pulls the representations from
different modalities closer. Third, an online knowledge distillation is
proposed to enhance the knowledge transfer from the text to the speech task.

an arbitrary accuracy, widely used for verifying floating-point computations.
Yet this simplicity belies challenges. Some inputs violate preconditions or
cause domain errors. Others cause the algorithm to enter an infinite loop and
fail to compute a ground truth. Plus, finding valid inputs is itself a
challenge when invalid and unsamplable points make up the vast majority of the
input space. These issues can make interval arithmetic brittle and
temperamental.
  This paper introduces three extensions to interval arithmetic to address
these challenges. Error intervals express rich notions of input validity and
indicate whether all or some points in an interval violate implicit or explicit
preconditions. Movability flags detect futile recomputations and prevent
timeouts by indicating whether a higher-precision recomputation will yield a
more accurate result. Andinput search restricts sampling to valid, samplable
points, so they are easier to find. We compare these extensions to the
state-of-the-art technical computing software Mathematica, and demonstrate that
our extensions are able to resolve 60.3% more challenging inputs, return 10.2x

the entire scene. This paper presents the Visual Parser (ViP) that explicitly
constructs such a hierarchy with transformers. ViP divides visual
representations into two levels, the part level and the whole level.
Information of each part represents a combination of several independent
vectors within the whole. To model the representations of the two levels, we
first encode the information from the whole into part vectors through an
attention mechanism, then decode the global information within the part vectors
back into the whole representation. By iteratively parsing the two levels with
the proposed encoder-decoder interaction, the model can gradually refine the
features on both levels. Experimental results demonstrate that ViP can achieve
very competitive performance on three major tasks e.g. classification,
detection and instance segmentation. In particular, it can surpass the previous
state-of-the-art CNN backbones by a large margin on object detection. The tiny
model of the ViP family with $7.2\times$ fewer parameters and $10.9\times$
fewer FLOPS can perform comparably with the largest model

attention in Secondary Studies in Software Engineering (SE). Notably,
Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) studies, that search for evidence in both
Traditional Literature (TL) and GL, is particularly benefiting from this raise
of GL content. Despite the growing interest in MLR-based studies, the
literature assessing how GL has contributed to MLR studies is still scarce.
Objective: This research aims to assess how the use of GL contributed to MLR
studies. By contributing, we mean, understanding to what extent GL is providing
evidence that is indeed used by an MLR to answer its research question. Method:
We conducted a tertiary study to identify MLR studies published between 2017
and 2019, selecting nine MLRs studies. Using qualitative and quantitative
analysis, we identified the GL used and assessed to what extent these MLRs are
contributing to MLR studies. Results: Our analysis identified that 1) GL
provided evidence not found in TL, 2) most of the GL sources were used to
provide recommendations to solve problems, explain a topic, and classify the
findings, and 3) 19 different GL types were used in the studies; these GLs were
mainly produced by SE practitioners (including blog posts, slides
presentations, or project descriptions). Conclusions: We evidence how GL
contributed to MLR studies. We observed that if these GLs were not included in
the MLR, several findings would have been omitted or weakened. We also
described the challenges involved when conducting this investigation, along
with potential ways to deal with them, which may help future SE researchers.

co-evolution model, where each vertex $i$ in the network has a current opinion

relationship between $i,j$. The system evolves as the opinions and edge weights
are updated over time by the following rules, Opinion Dynamics and Appraisal
Dynamics. We are interested in characterizing the long-time behavior of the
dynamic model -- i.e., whether edge weights evolve to have stable signs
(positive or negative) and structural balance (the multiplication of weights on
any triangle is non-negative).
  Our main theoretical result solves the above dynamic system with
time-evolving opinions $V(t)=[v1(t),\cdots,vn(t)]$ and social tie weights
$W(t)=[w_{ij}(t)]_{n\times n}$. For a generic initial opinion vector $V(0)$ and

first one is that both sign stability and structural balance (for any triangle

that $V(0)$ is an eigenvector of $W(0)$, we are able to obtain the explicit
solution to the co-evolution equation and give exact estimates on the blowup
time and rate convergence. The second one is that all the opinions converge to

shell in the Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi spacetime with a homogeneous dust density
using different quantization strategies motivated by loop quantum gravity.
Prior work has dealt with loop quantizing this model by employing holonomies
and the triads, following the procedure in standard loop quantum cosmology. In
this work we compare this quantization with the one in which holonomies and
gauge-covariant fluxes are used. While both of the quantization schemes resolve
the central singularity, they lead to different mass gaps at which a trapped
surface forms. This trapped surface which is matched to an exterior generalized
Vaidya spacetime disappears when the density of the dust shell is in the Planck
regime. We find that the quantization based on holonomies and gauge-covariant
fluxes generically results in an asymmetric evolution of the dust shell in
which the effective mass associated with the white hole as seen by an external
observer is $2/\pi$ of the one for the black hole. This effective difference in
masses results from difference in the classical limits in pre- and post-bounce
regimes in the two quantizations. This distinctive feature rules out formation
of any black hole-white hole twin in presence of gauge-covariant flux
modifications which is in contrast to the quantization using holonomies and
triads where the gravitational collapse always leads to a black hole-white hole
twins. In another striking difference, for the quantization based on holonomies
and gauge-covariant fluxes there can be situations in which during a
non-singular collapse only a black hole forms without a white hole.

further reveals that readers separately attend to basic text features and
question-relevant information during first-pass reading and rereading,
respectively. Similarly, text features and question relevance separately
modulate attention weights in shallow and deep DNN layers. Furthermore, when
readers scan a passage without a question in mind, their reading time is
predicted by DNNs optimized for a word prediction task. Therefore, attention
during real-world reading can be interpreted as the consequence of task
optimization.

many orders of magnitude if the seed field is weak. We have found that the
suppression and amplification processes can be evaluated continuously along
with the amplitude of the Alfv\'en number $R_A$, which is defined as the ratio
of the linear growth velocity of the RMI to the Alfv\'en speed at the
interface. When the Alfv\'en number is less than unity, the Lorentz force
acting on the fluid mitigates the unstable motion of the RMI significantly, and
the interface oscillates stably in this limit. If $R_A \gtrsim 1$, on the other
hand, the surface modulation increases due to the growth of the RMI. The
maximum strength of the magnetic field is enhanced up to by a factor of $R_A$.
This critical feature is universal and independent of the initial Mach number

using far fewer degrees of freedom than the total number of parameters. We
analyze this phenomenon for random subspaces by first examining the success
probability of hitting a training loss sub-level set when training within a
random subspace of a given training dimensionality. We find a sharp phase
transition in the success probability from $0$ to $1$ as the training dimension
surpasses a threshold. This threshold training dimension increases as the
desired final loss decreases, but decreases as the initial loss decreases. We
then theoretically explain the origin of this phase transition, and its
dependence on initialization and final desired loss, in terms of properties of
the high-dimensional geometry of the loss landscape. In particular, we show via
Gordon's escape theorem, that the training dimension plus the Gaussian width of
the desired loss sub-level set, projected onto a unit sphere surrounding the
initialization, must exceed the total number of parameters for the success
probability to be large. In several architectures and datasets, we measure the
threshold training dimension as a function of initialization and demonstrate
that it is a small fraction of the total parameters, implying by our theory
that successful training with so few dimensions is possible precisely because
the Gaussian width of low loss sub-level sets is very large. Moreover, we
compare this threshold training dimension to more sophisticated ways of
reducing training degrees of freedom, including lottery tickets as well as a
new, analogous method: lottery subspaces. Code is available at

We demonstrate gradual topologies evolution in a multi-electrode configuration.
We conduct a detail electrical characterization of the PEDOT:PSS dendrites

dissipative property is served by the natural noise added to the quantum bits.
The performance of this natural quantum reservoir is demonstrated in a
benchmark time-series regression problem and a practical problem classifying
different objects based on temporal sensor data. In both cases the proposed
reservoir computer shows a higher performance than a linear regression or

linear measurements to perform computations on a high dimensional input and
using structured queries to access a massive input. Typically, algorithms in
the former paradigm are non-adaptive whereas those in the latter are highly
adaptive. This work studies the fundamental search problem of
\textsc{element-extraction} in a query model that combines both: linear
measurements with bounded adaptivity.
  In the \textsc{element-extraction} problem, one is given a nonzero vector
$\mathbf{z} = (z_1,\ldots,z_n) \in \{0,1\}^n$ and must report an index $i$
where $z_i = 1$. The input can be accessed using arbitrary linear functions of
it with coefficients in some ring. This problem admits an efficient nonadaptive
randomized solution (through the well known technique of $\ell_0$-sampling) and
an efficient fully adaptive deterministic solution (through binary search). We
prove that when confined to only $k$ rounds of adaptivity, a deterministic
\textsc{element-extraction} algorithm must spend $\Omega(k (n^{1/k} -1))$
queries, when working in the ring of integers modulo some fixed $q$. This
matches the corresponding upper bound. For queries using integer arithmetic, we
prove a $2$-round $\widetilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{n})$ lower bound, also tight up to
polylogarithmic factors. Our proofs reduce to classic problems in
combinatorics, and take advantage of established results on the {\em zero-sum

present a systematic investigation of the angular resolution effects, with
special attention being paid to the derived masses of sources as well as the
shape of the resulting source mass functions (SMFs). We tested the impact of
angular resolution, from 0.6 down to 0.02 pc, in two star-forming regions
observed with Herschel (NGC6334 and Aquila), and three (magneto)-hydrodynamical
simulations. We detected and measured sources at each resolution using getsf
and we analysed the derived masses and sizes of the sources. We find that the
number of sources does not converge from 0.6 to 0.05 pc. It increases by about
two when the angular resolution increases with a similar factor. Below 0.05 pc,
the number of source still increases by about 1.3 when the angular resolution
increases by two, suggesting that we are close to, but not yet at, convergence.
We find that the measured sizes and masses of sources linearly depend on the
angular resolution with no sign of convergence to a resolution-independent
value. The corresponding SMF peak also shifts with angular resolution, while
the slope of the high-mass tail of the SMFs remains almost invariant. If
prestellar cores, physically distinct from their background, exist in
cluster-forming molecular clouds, we conclude that their mass must be lower
than reported so far in the literature. We discuss various implications for the
studies of star formation: the problem of determining the mass reservoirs
involved in the star-formation process; the inapplicability of the Gaussian
beam deconvolution to infer source sizes; and the impossibility to determine
the efficiency of the mass conversion from the cores to the stars.

subsequently run a risk of privacy leakage after the restoration of secret
images at the receiving end. To address this issue, we propose a framework,

of the direct recognition is to preserve identity information of secret images

contradictory aspects. We demonstrate that the robustness results can be

fault-slip in laboratory experiments has recently progressed markedly due to
large training data sets. In Earth however, earthquake interevent times range
from 10's-100's of years and geophysical data typically exist for only a
portion of an earthquake cycle. Sparse data presents a serious challenge to
training machine learning models. Here we describe a transfer learning approach
using numerical simulations to train a convolutional encoder-decoder that
predicts fault-slip behavior in laboratory experiments. The model learns a
mapping between acoustic emission histories and fault-slip from numerical
simulations, and generalizes to produce accurate results using laboratory data.
Notably slip-predictions markedly improve using the simulation-data
trained-model and training the latent space using a portion of a single
laboratory earthquake-cycle. The transfer learning results elucidate the
potential of using models trained on numerical simulations and fine-tuned with
small geophysical data sets for potential applications to faults in Earth.

unlike those approaches it recovers the classical critical damping condition,
which determines transitions between energy eigenstates, and is therefore
consistent with the correspondence principle. It is also demonstrated how to
apply the procedure to a driven damped harmonic oscillator.

  Enhancement","Accepted by ACM MM 2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is a pervasive yet challenging problem,
since: 1) low-light measurements may vary due to different imaging conditions
in practice; 2) images can be enlightened subjectively according to diverse
preferences by each individual. To tackle these two challenges, this paper
presents a novel deep reinforcement learning based method, dubbed ReLLIE, for
customized low-light enhancement. ReLLIE models LLIE as a markov decision
process, i.e., estimating the pixel-wise image-specific curves sequentially and
recurrently. Given the reward computed from a set of carefully crafted
non-reference loss functions, a lightweight network is proposed to estimate the
curves for enlightening of a low-light image input. As ReLLIE learns a policy
instead of one-one image translation, it can handle various low-light
measurements and provide customized enhanced outputs by flexibly applying the
policy different times. Furthermore, ReLLIE can enhance real-world images with
hybrid corruptions, e.g., noise, by using a plug-and-play denoiser easily.
Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the advantages of
ReLLIE, comparing to the state-of-the-art methods.

Galaxy as demonstrated by space missions like CoRoT and Kepler. However,
previous observations have been limited to small data sets and fields-of-view.
The TESS mission provides far larger samples and, for the first time, the
opportunity to perform asteroseimic inference from full-frame images full-sky,
instead of narrow fields and pre-selected targets. Here, we seek to detect
oscillations in TESS data of the red giants in the Kepler field using the 4-yr
Kepler results as benchmark. Because we use 1-2 sectors of observation, our
results are representative of the typical scenario from TESS data. We detect
clear oscillations in ~3000 stars with another ~1000 borderline (low S/N)
cases. In comparison, best-case predictions suggests ~4500 detectable
oscillating giants. Of the clear detections, we measure Dnu in 570 stars,
meaning a ~20% Dnu yield (14% for one sector and 26% for two sectors). These
yields imply that typical (1-2 sector) TESS data will result in significant
detection biases. Hence, to boost the number of stars, one might need to use
only Numax as the seismic input for stellar property estimation. However, we
find little bias in the seismic measurements and typical scatter is about 5-6%
in Numax and 2-3% in Dnu. These values, coupled with typical uncertainties in
parallax, Teff, and [Fe/H] in a grid-based approach, would provide internal
uncertainties of 3% in inferred stellar radius, 6% in mass and 20% in age for
low-luminosity giant stars. Finally, we find red giant seismology is not
significantly affected by seismic signal confusion from blending for stars with
Tmag < 12.5.

between attributes of neighboring nodes is modeled by the
Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern copula, enabling us to derive approximate analytical

various automatic hyperparameter optimization (HPO) methods, e.g., based on
resampling error estimation for supervised machine learning, can be employed.
After introducing HPO from a general perspective, this paper reviews important
HPO methods such as grid or random search, evolutionary algorithms, Bayesian
optimization, Hyperband and racing. It gives practical recommendations
regarding important choices to be made when conducting HPO, including the HPO
algorithms themselves, performance evaluation, how to combine HPO with ML
pipelines, runtime improvements, and parallelization. This work is accompanied

  Black and Dark Separation by Angular Momentum","19 pages, 3 figures",,,,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many supermassive black holes (SMBH) of mass $10^{6\sim9}M_{\odot}$ are
observed at the center of each galaxy even in the high redshift ($z\approx7$)
Universe. To explain the early formation and the common existence of SMBH, we
proposed previously the SMBH formation scenario by the gravitational collapse
of the coherent dark matter (DM) composed from the Bose-Einstein Condensed
(BEC) objects. A difficult problem in this scenario is the inevitable angular
momentum which prevents the collapse of BEC. To overcome this difficulty, in
this paper, we consider the very early Universe when the BEC-DM acquires its
proper angular momentum by the tidal torque mechanism. The balance of the
density evolution and the acquisition of the angular momentum determines the
mass of the SMBH as well as the mass ratio of BH and the surrounding dark halo
(DH). This ratio turns out to be
$M_{BH}/M_{DH}\approx10^{-3\sim-5}(M_{tot}/10^{12}\mathrm{M}_{\odot})^{-1/2}$
assuming simple density profiles of the initial DM cloud. This estimate turns
out to be consistent with the observations at $z\approx0$ and $z\approx6$,
although the data scatter is large. Thus the angular momentum determines the
separation of black and dark, \textsl{i.e. }SMBH and DH, in the original DM
cloud.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem where the transition kernel $P^*$ belongs
to a family of models $\mathcal{P}^*$ with finite metric entropy. In the model
selection framework, instead of $\mathcal{P}^*$, we are given $M$ nested
families of transition kernels $\cP_1 \subset \cP_2 \subset \ldots \subset
\cP_M$. We propose and analyze a novel algorithm, namely \emph{Adaptive
Reinforcement Learning (General)} (\texttt{ARL-GEN}) that adapts to the
smallest such family where the true transition kernel $P^*$ lies.
\texttt{ARL-GEN} uses the Upper Confidence Reinforcement Learning
(\texttt{UCRL}) algorithm with value targeted regression as a blackbox and puts
a model selection module at the beginning of each epoch. Under a mild
separability assumption on the model classes, we show that \texttt{ARL-GEN}
obtains a regret of
$\Tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d_{\mathcal{E}}^*H^2+\sqrt{d_{\mathcal{E}}^* \mathbb{M}^*

total number of steps, $d_{\mathcal{E}}^*$ is the Eluder dimension and
$\mathbb{M}^*$ is the metric entropy corresponding to $\mathcal{P}^*$. Note
that this regret scaling matches that of an oracle that knows $\mathcal{P}^*$
in advance. We show that the cost of model selection for \texttt{ARL-GEN} is an
additive term in the regret having a weak dependence on $T$. Subsequently, we
remove the separability assumption and consider the setup of linear mixture
MDPs, where the transition kernel $P^*$ has a linear function approximation.
With this low rank structure, we propose novel adaptive algorithms for model
selection, and obtain (order-wise) regret identical to that of an oracle with

an algorithm agnostic, model-based representation for domains, problems, and

category theoretic representation is accompanied by a graphical syntax in

appropriate constructive abstraction and facilitates comprehension for human

However, most current deployed UAVs rely on the global navigation satellite

system with a 2D georeference map to obtain accurate and consecutive geodetic
positions for UAVs. The proposed system firstly integrates a micro inertial
measurement unit (MIMU) and a monocular camera as odometry to consecutively
estimate the navigation states and reconstruct the 3D position of the observed
visual features in the local world frame. To obtain the geolocation, the visual
features tracked by the odometry are further registered to the 2D georeferenced
map. While most conventional methods perform image-level aerial image
registration, we propose to align the reconstructed points to the map points in
the geodetic frame; this helps to filter out the large portion of outliers and
decouples the negative effects from the horizontal angles. The registered
points are then used to relocalize the vehicle in the geodetic frame. Finally,
a pose graph is deployed to fuse the geolocation from the aerial image
registration and the local navigation result from the visual-inertial odometry
(VIO) to achieve consecutive and drift-free geolocalization performance. We
have validated the proposed method by installing the sensors to a UAV body
rigidly and have conducted two flights in different environments with unknown
initials. The results show that the proposed method can achieve less than 4m
position error in flight at 100m high and less than 9m position error in flight

control over the market and that the allocation she dictates is final. In
practice, however, agents might be able to resell acquired items in an
aftermarket. A prominent example is the market for carbon emission allowances.
These allowances are commonly allocated by the government using uniform-price
auctions, and firms can typically trade these allowances among themselves in an
aftermarket that may not be fully under the auctioneer's control. While the
uniform-price auction is approximately efficient in isolation, we show that
speculation and resale in aftermarkets might result in a significant welfare
loss. Motivated by this issue, we consider three approaches, each ensuring high
equilibrium welfare in the combined market. The first approach is to adopt
smooth auctions such as discriminatory auctions. This approach is robust to
correlated valuations and to participants acquiring information about others'
types. However, discriminatory auctions have several downsides, notably that of
charging bidders different prices for identical items, resulting in fairness
concerns that make the format unpopular. Two other approaches we suggest are
either using posted-pricing mechanisms, or using uniform-price auctions with
anonymous reserves. We show that when using balanced prices, both these
approaches ensure high equilibrium welfare in the combined market. The latter
also inherits many of the benefits from uniform-price auctions such as price
discovery, and can be introduced with a minor modification to auctions
currently in use to sell carbon emission allowances.

masses; but the consequence of this mass difference on Coulomb scatterings has
been considered intractable and thus ignored up to now. The reason is that the

Coulomb scattering; so, a heavy hole can turn light, depending on the
scattering angle. This mass change has never been taken into account in
many-body problems, and a single ``average'' hole mass has been used instead.
In order to study the missed consequences of this crude approximation, the
first necessary step is to determine the Coulomb scatterings with valence holes
in a precise way. We here derive these scatterings from scratch, starting from
the threefold valence-electron spatial level, all the way through the

large-batch training due to the reduced number of updating steps. In this work,
we propose an automated LR scheduling algorithm which is effective for neural
network training with a large batch size under the given epoch budget. In
specific, the whole schedule consists of two phases: adaptive warmup and
predefined decay, where the LR is increased until the training loss no longer
decreases and decreased to zero until the end of training. Here, whether the
training loss has reached the minimum value is robustly checked with Gaussian
process smoothing in an online manner with a low computational burden. Coupled
with adaptive stochastic optimizers such as AdamP and LAMB, the proposed

and requires significant efforts to converse with the claimant. This is a
highly professional job that involves many parts, such as identifying personal
information, collecting related evidence, and making a final insurance report.
Due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the previous offline insurance
assessment has to be conducted online. However, for the junior assessor often
lacking practical experience, it is not easy to quickly handle such a complex
online procedure, yet this is important as the insurance company needs to
decide how much compensation the claimant should receive based on the
assessor's feedback. In order to promote assessors' work efficiency and speed
up the overall procedure, in this paper, we propose a dialogue-based
information extraction system that integrates advanced NLP technologies for
medical insurance assessment. With the assistance of our system, the average
time cost of the procedure is reduced from 55 minutes to 35 minutes, and the
total human resources cost is saved 30% compared with the previous offline
procedure. Until now, the system has already served thousands of online claim
cases.

finite energy develop a potential finite time singularity at the origin. This
potential singularity is different from the blow-up scenario revealed by
Luo-Hou in \cite{luo2014potentially,luo2014toward}, which occurs on the
boundary. Our initial condition has a simple form and shares several attractive
features of a more sophisticated initial condition constructed by Hou-Huang in
\cite{Hou-Huang-2021,Hou-Huang-2022}. One important difference between these
two blow-up scenarios is that the solution for our initial data has a one-scale
structure instead of a two-scale structure reported in
\cite{Hou-Huang-2021,Hou-Huang-2022}. More importantly, the solution seems to
develop nearly self-similar scaling properties that are compatible with those
of the 3D Navier-Stokes equations. We will present numerical evidence that the
3D Euler equations seem to develop a potential finite time singularity.
Moreover, the nearly self-similar profile seems to be very stable to the small
perturbation of the initial data.

of the fixed-template Promise Constraint Satisfaction Problem (PCSP). Our main
technical finding is that the template of every PCSP that is solvable in
bounded width satisfies a certain structural condition implying that its
algebraic closure-properties include weak near unanimity polymorphisms of all
large arities. While this parallels the standard (non-promise) CSP theory, the
method of proof is quite different and applies even to the regime of sublinear
width. We also show that, in contrast with the CSP world, the presence of weak
near unanimity polymorphisms of all large arities does not guarantee
solvability in bounded width. The separating example is even solvable in the
second level of the Sherali-Adams (SA) hierarchy of linear programming
relaxations. This shows that, unlike for CSPs, linear programming can be
stronger than bounded width. A direct application of these methods also show
that the problem of $q$-coloring $p$-colorable graphs is not solvable in
bounded or even sublinear width, for any two constants $p$ and $q$ such that $3
\leq p \leq q$. Turning to algorithms, we note that Wigderson's algorithm for
$O(\sqrt{n})$-coloring $3$-colorable graphs with $n$ vertices is implementable
in width $4$. Indeed, by generalizing the method we see that, for any $\epsilon
> 0$ smaller than $1/2$, the optimal width for solving the problem of
$O(n^\epsilon)$-coloring $3$-colorable graphs with $n$ vertices lies between
$n^{1-3\epsilon}$ and $n^{1-2\epsilon}$. The upper bound gives a simple
$2^{\Theta(n^{1-2\epsilon}\log(n))}$-time algorithm that, asymptotically, beats
the straightforward $2^{\Theta(n^{1-\epsilon})}$ bound that follows from
partitioning the graph into $O(n^\epsilon)$ many independent parts each of size
$O(n^{1-\epsilon})$.

The proposed mechanism is based on the dipole interaction between the light

the proposed physical mechanism. It is demonstrated that stimulated
amplification spectral line frequencies observed experimentally are well
explained by the proposed mechanism. In particular, the absence of
lower-frequency lines and the shifting of generation lines when the pH changes
are due to ion friction in the ionic solution environment. The selection rules
observed experimentally also confirm the dipole interaction type. It is shown
that microwave radiation on virus acoustic vibrations frequency should appear
under such scattering conditions. We demonstrate that such conditions also
allow for local selective heating of viruses. This effect is controlled by the
optical irradiation parameters and can be used to selectively affect a specific
type of virus.

conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) type. Remarkably, the electrons
and phonons of the heavy La atoms, instead of those of the light O atoms,
contribute most to the electron-phonon coupling. We further find that both the
biaxial tensile strain and the pure electron doping can enhance the
superconducting $T_c$ of LaO. With the synergistic effect of electron doping
and tensile strain, the $T_c$ could be even higher, for example, 11.11 K at a
doping of 0.2 electrons per formula unit and a tensile strain of $4\%$.

literature to either estimate, approximate, or lower and upper bound this
divergence. In this paper, we propose a simple yet fast heuristic to
approximate the Jeffreys divergence between two univariate Gaussian mixtures
with arbitrary number of components. Our heuristic relies on converting the
mixtures into pairs of dually parameterized probability densities belonging to
an exponential family. In particular, we consider the versatile polynomial
exponential family densities, and design a divergence to measure in closed-form
the goodness of fit between a Gaussian mixture and its polynomial exponential
density approximation. This goodness-of-fit divergence is a generalization of
the Hyv\""arinen divergence used to estimate models with computationally
intractable normalizers. It allows us to perform model selection by choosing
the orders of the polynomial exponential densities used to approximate the
mixtures. We demonstrate experimentally that our heuristic to approximate the
Jeffreys divergence improves by several orders of magnitude the computational
time of stochastic Monte Carlo estimations while approximating reasonably well
the Jeffreys divergence, specially when the mixtures have a very small number
of modes. Besides, our mixture-to-exponential family conversion techniques may
prove useful in other settings.

considerable attention in recent years due to their high training speed and
ability to model a long-range global context. Position embedding in the
transformer architecture is indispensable because it provides supervision for
dependency modeling between elements at different positions in the input
sequence. To make use of the time order of the input sequence, many works
inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the element
into the input sequence. In this work, we investigate various position
embedding methods in the convolution-augmented transformer (conformer) and
adopt a novel implementation named rotary position embedding (RoPE). RoPE
encodes absolute positional information into the input sequence by a rotation
matrix, and then naturally incorporates explicit relative position information
into a self-attention module. To evaluate the effectiveness of the RoPE method,
we conducted experiments on AISHELL-1 and LibriSpeech corpora. Results show
that the conformer enhanced with RoPE achieves superior performance in the
speech recognition task. Specifically, our model achieves a relative word error
rate reduction of 8.70% and 7.27% over the conformer on test-clean and
test-other sets of the LibriSpeech corpus respectively.

conventional manual inspection methods or even traditional machine

a lack of rigorous comparison among the representative log-based anomaly

better understand the characteristics of different anomaly detectors, in this

informative labels) can instead return us more accurate and fair models. We are
primarily inspired by three observations: 1) In contrast to reducing label
noise rates, increasing the noise rates is easy to implement; 2) Increasing a
certain class of instances' label noise to balance the noise rates
(increasing-to-balancing) results in an easier learning problem; 3)
Increasing-to-balancing improves fairness guarantees against label bias. In
this paper, we first quantify the trade-offs introduced by increasing a certain
group of instances' label noise rate w.r.t. the loss of label informativeness
and the lowered learning difficulties. We analytically demonstrate when such an
increase is beneficial, in terms of either improved generalization power or the
fairness guarantees. Then we present a method to insert label noise properly
for the task of learning with noisy labels, either without or with a fairness
constraint. The primary technical challenge we face is due to the fact that we
would not know which data instances are suffering from higher noise, and we
would not have the ground truth labels to verify any possible hypothesis. We
propose a detection method that informs us which group of labels might suffer
from higher noise without using ground truth labels. We formally establish the
effectiveness of the proposed solution and demonstrate it with extensive
experiments.

Due to the lack of paired data of original solo music and their full

multitrack music, assuming that the mixture is to be played on a keyboard. We
frame the task of part separation as a sequential multi-class classification

essential to many technological applications of organic semiconductors, such as

degenerate limit only at impurity concentrations of 5-10\%, a phenomenon that
has been put in relation to the strong Coulomb binding between charge carriers
and ionized dopants, and whose comprehension remained elusive so far. This
study proposes a general mechanism for the release of carriers at finite doping
in terms of collective screening phenomena. A multiscale model for the
dielectric properties of doped organic semiconductor is set up by combining
first principles and microelectrostatic calculations. Our results predict a
large nonlinear enhancement of the dielectric constant (ten-fold at 8\% load)
as the system approaches a dielectric instability (catastrophe) upon increasing
doping. This can be attributed to the presence of highly polarizable
host-dopant complexes, plus a nontrivial leading contribution from dipolar
interactions in the disordered and heterogeneous system. The enhanced screening
in the material drastically reduces the (free) energy barriers for
electron-hole separation, rationalizing the possibility for thermal charge
release. The proposed mechanism is consistent with conductivity data and sets
the basis for achieving higher conductivities at lower doping loads.

while just partial physical variables are often prescribed as physical boundary
conditions. Certain extrapolation technique or ghost cells are often employed
traditionally for this issue but spurious wave reflections often arise to cause
numerical instability. In this paper, we associate this issue with the
one-sided generalized Riemann problem (GRP) solver motivated by the accelerated
piston problem in gas dynamics so that the extrapolation technique can be
actually avoided. In fact, the compatibility arguments naturally requires to
formulate the one-sided generalized Riemann problem and incorporate it into the
numerical procedure of boundary conditions. As far as the interaction of
nonlinear waves with physical boundaries, such a one-sided GRP solver shows
significant effects, as numerical experiments demonstrate, on avoiding spurious
wave reflections at the computational boundaries.

the regression under Dirac delta distribution undermine the detection
performance and the generalization ability. In this paper, we propose an

decomposes text instances into the combination of text kernels and centripetal
shifts. Specifically, we utilize the centripetal shifts to implement pixel
aggregation, guiding the external text pixels to the internal text kernels. The
relaxation operation is integrated into the dense regression for centripetal

The convenient reconstruction of text contours and the tolerance of prediction

remote--sensing images (RSI) relies on manual annotations. However, in the area
of remote sensing, it is hard to obtain huge amounts of labeled data. Recently,
self--supervised learning shows its outstanding capability to learn
representations of images, especially the methods of instance discrimination.
Comparing methods of instance discrimination, clustering--based methods not
only view the transformations of the same image as ``positive"" samples but also
similar images. In this paper, we propose a new clustering-based method for
representation learning. We first introduce a quantity to measure
representations' discriminativeness and from which we show that even
distribution requires the most discriminative representations. This provides a
theoretical insight into why evenly distributing the images works well. We
notice that only the even distributions that preserve representations'
neighborhood relations are desirable. Therefore, we develop an algorithm that
translates the outputs of a neural network to achieve the goal of evenly
distributing the samples while preserving outputs' neighborhood relations.
Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method can learn
representations that are as good as or better than the state of the art
approaches, and that our method performs computationally efficiently and
robustly on various RSI datasets.

simplicity, combined with strong scientific and technological interests,
atom-surface physics, at its fundamental level, remains largely unexplored
mainly because of challenges associated with precise control of the
atom-surface distance. Nevertheless, substantial breakthroughs have been made
over the last two decades. With the development of cold and quantum atomic
gases, one has gained further control on atom-surface position, naturally
leading to improved precision in the Casimir-Polder interaction measurement.
Advances have also been reported in finding experimental knobs to tune and even
reverse the Casimir-Polder interaction strength. So far, this has only been
achieved for atoms in short-lived excited states, however, the rapid progresses
in material sciences, e.g. metamaterials and topological materials have
inspired new ideas for controlling the atom-surface interaction in long-lived
states. In addition, combining nano-photonic and atom-surface physics is now
envisioned for applications in quantum information processing. The first
purpose of this review is to give a general overview on the latest experimental

vision of the future of the field, mainly inspired by the abundant theoretical

transfer, as well as stellar winds, jets, eclipses, or intrinsic variability of
the components. Dozens of new symbiotic stars and candidates have been
discovered in recent years. However, there are many objects which are still
poorly studied. Some symbiotic candidates suspected in the literature have
never been studied spectroscopically. In this contribution, we present the
first results of the ongoing campaign focused on symbiotic candidates. In the
first paper in the series, we study the nature of ten candidate classical
symbiotic stars suspected based on their photometric behaviour, colours or
abundance pattern. To confirm or reject the symbiotic nature of the studied
candidates, we obtained new spectra and analysed them in detail together with
available multi-frequency photometric and spectroscopic observations of the
objects. Hen 3-860 and V2204 Oph are genuine symbiotic systems showing typical
spectral features of burning symbiotic stars and outbursts in the last 100

stars. V1988 Sgr cannot be classified as a genuine burning symbiotic star, but
the scenario of an accreting-only symbiotic system cannot be ruled out. Hen

it is often challenged by the requirements of fast packet processing, real-time
and accurate detection, as well as resource efficiency. Existing HHH detection
schemes either incur expensive packet updates for multiple aggregation levels
in the IP address hierarchy, or need to process sufficient packets to converge
to the required detection accuracy. We present MVPipe, an invertible sketch
that achieves both lightweight updates and fast convergence in HHH detection.
MVPipe builds on the skewness property of IP traffic to process packets via a
pipeline of majority voting executions, such that most packets can be updated
for only one or few aggregation levels in the IP address hierarchy. We show how
MVPipe can be feasibly deployed in P4-based programmable switches subject to
limited switch resources. We also theoretically analyze the accuracy and
coverage properties of MVPipe. Evaluation with real-world Internet traces shows
that MVPipe achieves high accuracy, high throughput, and fast convergence
compared to six state-of-the-art HHH detection schemes. It also incurs low
resource overhead in the Barefoot Tofino switch deployment.

reprocessing order of the OSD is as low as one, the new decoder is shown to
significantly improve on plain CBPL. To implement the OSD efficiently, we adapt
the matrix triangulation algorithm from the BEC case. We also indicate how the
decoding algorithms can be implemented in parallel for low latency decoding.
Numerical simulations are used to evaluate the performance and computational
complexity of the new algorithms.

lose and subsequently regain stability as the Rayleigh number is increased. We

temporal changes to the propagation phase in a bulk medium resulting from
temporal variations in the refractive index, an effect referred to as temporal
refraction. Here, we show that the frequency shift in an epsilon-near-zero

response, but includes a significant effect resulting from temporal changes to

opposing shift to the bulk effect for certain angles. Hence, this process gives
rise to a frequency shift that can be tailored through the angle of incidence,
decoupling the amplitude and phase modulation.

This type of bias becomes more evident in generating conversational utterances

applications still work on a sentence-level context. As a step towards more
inclusive NLP, this paper proposes an automatic and generalisable rewriting
approach for short conversational sentences. The rewriting method can be
applied to sentences that, without extra-sentential context, have multiple
equivalent alternatives in terms of gender. The method can be applied both for
creating gender balanced outputs as well as for creating gender balanced

of this research is to design a model for Large Earth impact events, describing
atmospheric entry, ground impact and post-impact dynamics for impactors large
enough to cause harm to the Earth. We present results of Large Earth Impact
(LEI) events involving a number of objects with densities ranging between $1000
- 8000 kg m^{-3}$. We use Python code to solve differential equations and
perform calculations on analytical models built into the collision simulation
algorithms while feeding relevant physical input in terms of object velocity
and diameter. We find that denser impactors have slower rates of decrease in
momentum while hitting the atmosphere. The denser impactors which exhibit
greater resistance to atmospheric disruption result in more energetic ground
impacts events in terms of crater formation, thermal radiation generation,
seismic effects, ejecta displacement and air-blast effects. We conclude that
impacting objects with high masses maintain greater kinetic energies compared
to objects with less mass thus posing greater collisional threats to the Earth.

domains. These systems are impotent in affecting users to choose the behavior
that the system expects. Meanwhile, providing incentives has been proven to be
a more proactive way to affect users' behaviors. Due to the budget limitation,
the number of users who can be incentivized is restricted. In this light, we
intend to utilize social influence existing among users to enhance the effect
of incentivization. Through incentivizing influential users directly, their
followers in the social network are possibly incentivized indirectly. However,
in many real-world scenarios, the topological structure of the network is
usually unknown, which makes identifying influential users difficult. To tackle
the aforementioned challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for
exploring influential users in unknown networks, which can estimate the
influential relationships among users based on their historical behaviors and
without knowing the topology of the network. Meanwhile, we design an adaptive

outcome but not the agent's actual action, which is why the sharing rule can
only be based on the outcome. The hidden-action model builds on somewhat
idealized assumptions about the principal's and the agent's capabilities
related to information access. We propose an agent-based model that relaxes
some of these assumptions. Our analysis lays particular focus on the
micro-level dynamics triggered by limited access to information. For the
principal's sphere, we identify the so-called Sisyphus effect that explains why
the sharing rule that provides the agent with incentives to take optimal action
is difficult to achieve if the information is limited, and we identify factors
that moderate this effect. In addition, we analyze the behavioral dynamics in
the agent's sphere. We show that the agent might make even more of an effort
than optimal under unlimited access to information, which we refer to as excess
effort. Interestingly, the principal can control the probability of making an
excess effort via the incentive mechanism. However, how much excess effort the
agent finally makes is out of the principal's direct control.

centers results in high electricity bills as well as emission of a large amount
of carbon dioxide gas. Needless to say, efficient resource management in cloud
environments has become one of the most important priorities of cloud providers
and consequently has increased the interest of researchers to propose novel
energy saving solutions. This chapter presents a scientific and taxonomic
survey of recent energy efficient cloud resource management' solutions in cloud
environments. The main objective of this study is to propose a novel complete
taxonomy for energy-efficient cloud resource management solutions, review
recent research advancements in this area, classify the existing techniques
based on our proposed taxonomy, and open up new research directions. Besides,
it reviews and surveys the literature in the range of 2015 through 2021 in the
subject of energy-efficient cloud resource management techniques and maps them

Gaussian process interpolation. By choosing the mean and the covariance
functions of a Gaussian process within parametric families, the user obtains a
family of Bayesian procedures to perform predictions about the unknown
function, and must choose a member of the family that will hopefully provide
good predictive performances. We base our study on the general concept of
scoring rules, which provides an effective framework for building leave-one-out
selection and validation criteria, and a notion of extended likelihood criteria
based on an idea proposed by Fasshauer and co-authors in 2009, which makes it
possible to recover standard selection criteria such as, for instance, the
generalized cross-validation criterion. Under this setting, we empirically show
on several test problems of the literature that the choice of an appropriate
family of models is often more important than the choice of a particular
selection criterion (e.g., the likelihood versus a leave-one-out selection
criterion). Moreover, our numerical results show that the regularity parameter
of a Mat{\'e}rn covariance can be selected effectively by most selection
criteria.

generate very similar samples of the bitcoin distribution. The generated
synthetic time series are visually indistinguishable from the real data. But
the numerical results show that the generated data were close to the real data

into text in another language. Traditional cascaded approaches for ST, using
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Machine Translation (MT) systems, are
prone to error propagation. End-to-end approaches use only one system to avoid
propagating error, yet are difficult to employ due to data scarcity. We explore
zero-shot translation, which enables translating a pair of languages that is
unseen during training, thus avoid the use of end-to-end ST data. Zero-shot
translation has been shown to work for multilingual machine translation, yet
has not been studied for speech translation. We attempt to build zero-shot ST
models that are trained only on ASR and MT tasks but can do ST task during
inference. The challenge is that the representation of text and audio is
significantly different, thus the models learn ASR and MT tasks in different
ways, making it non-trivial to perform zero-shot. These models tend to output
the wrong language when performing zero-shot ST. We tackle the issues by
including additional training data and an auxiliary loss function that
minimizes the text-audio difference. Our experiment results and analysis show
that the methods are promising for zero-shot ST. Moreover, our methods are
particularly useful in the few-shot settings where a limited amount of ST data
is available, with improvements of up to +11.8 BLEU points compared to direct
end-to-end ST models and +3.9 BLEU points compared to ST models fine-tuned from

is necessary for an agent to exploit its observation history in the considered
place and efficiently reach known goals. This ability can be associated with
spatial reasoning, where an agent is able to perceive spatial relationships and
regularities, and discover object characteristics. Recent work introduces
learnable policies parametrized by deep neural networks and trained with
Reinforcement Learning (RL). In classical RL setups, the capacity to map and
reason spatially is learned end-to-end, from reward alone. In this setting, we
introduce supplementary supervision in the form of auxiliary tasks designed to
favor the emergence of spatial perception capabilities in agents trained for a
goal-reaching downstream objective. We show that learning to estimate metrics
quantifying the spatial relationships between an agent at a given location and
a goal to reach has a high positive impact in Multi-Object Navigation settings.
Our method significantly improves the performance of different baseline agents,
that either build an explicit or implicit representation of the environment,
even matching the performance of incomparable oracle agents taking ground-truth
maps as input. A learning-based agent from the literature trained with the
proposed auxiliary losses was the winning entry to the Multi-Object Navigation

tractable models borrowed from statistical mechanics. We show that standard AGS

meaningful representations of training data in their latent space. Furthermore,
using these representations and combining Gibbs sampling with the MH algorithm

transport measurements are lacking. By using similar protonating technique on
FeSe single crystals, we obtained superconducting samples with Tc above 40 K.
We show that the obtained superconducting phase is not Hy-FeSe but actually an

using X-ray diffraction technique, two sets of index peaks corresponding with

non-Hermiticity, particularly through spectral degeneracies known as
exceptional points(EPs), is an emerging field that has both fundamental and
practical implications. Chiral behavior in the vicinity of EPs opens new
opportunities in radiation control, such as unidirectional reflection or lasing
with potential applications in areas ranging from cavity quantum
electrodynamics and spectral filtering to sensing and thermal imaging. However,
tuning and stabilizing a system to a discrete EP in parameter space is a
challenging task: either the system is operated close to an EP rather than
directly at the EP or the true power of EP is obscured by stability issues.
Here, we circumvent this challenge by designing a photonic system that operates
on a surface of exceptional points, known as an exceptional surface (ES). We
achieve this by using a waveguide-coupled optical resonator with an external
feedback loop that induces a nonreciprocal coupling between its frequency
degenerate clockwise (CW) and counterclockwise (CCW) traveling modes. By
operating the system at critical coupling on the ES, we demonstrate, for the
first time, the effect of chiral and degenerate coherent perfect absorption
(CPA) where input waves in only one direction are perfectly absorbed. This
novel type of CPA-EP is revealed through the observation of the predicted and
long-sought squared Lorentzian absorption lineshapes. We expect our results and
approach to serve as a bridge between non-Hermitian physics and other fields

AutoEncoders (VAE) that are then used to unravel some of the mechanisms behind

of real patches as well as the affinity of plant species to different soil
types, and the VAE also reaches a high level of accuracy, above 99%. Using the
artificially generated patches, we found that high order interactions tend to
suppress the positive effects of low order interactions. Finally, by
reconstructing successional trajectories we could identify the pioneer species

split sparticle spectrum is indicated. We discuss the possibility of such a
split sparticle spectrum in the supergravity unified model and show that a
splitting of the sfermion spectrum into light sleptons and heavy squarks
naturally arises within radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry driven
by heavy gluinos ($\tilde g$SUGRA). We discuss the possible avenues for the
discovery of supersymmetry at the LHC within this framework under the further
constraint of the recent muon anomaly result from the Fermilab Collaboration.
We show that the most likely candidates for early discovery of a sparticle at
the LHC are the chargino, the stau, the smuon and the selectron. We present a
set of benchmarks and discuss future directions for further work. Specifically,
we point to the most promising channels for SUSY discovery and estimate the
integrated luminosity needed for the discovery of these benchmarks at the High
Luminosity LHC and also at the High Energy LHC.

via a piecewise polynomial discretization in the dual. We provide a geometric
intuition behind the primal problem induced by the dual discretization and draw
connections to optimization over moment spaces. In contrast to existing
discretizations which suffer from a grid bias, we show that a piecewise

photons emanate from high altitude above the polar caps and gamma-rays
originate from outside the light-cylinder, within the striped wind current

on the magnetic axis obliquity and line of sight inclination with respect to
the neutron star rotation axis. By applying a $\rchi^2$ fitting technique, we
are able to pin down accurately the magnetosphere geometry. Further constrains
are obtained from radio polarization measurement following the rotating vector
model, including aberration and retardation effects. We found a good agreement
between our model and the time-aligned single or double peaked gamma-ray pulsar
observations. We deduce the magnetic inclination angle and the observer line of
sight with respect to the rotation axis within a small error bar. The
distinction between radio-loud or radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsars or only radio
pulsars can entirely be related to the geometry of the associated emitting
regions. The high altitude polar cap model combined with the striped wind

health. Clinical scores are commonly used among a wide variety of
decision-making models for determining the degree of disease deterioration at
the bedside. AutoScore was proposed as a useful clinical score generator based
on machine learning and a generalized linear model. Its current framework,
however, still leaves room for improvement when addressing unbalanced data of
rare events. Methods: Using machine intelligence approaches, we developed
AutoScore-Imbalance, which comprises three components: training dataset
optimization, sample weight optimization, and adjusted AutoScore. All scoring
models were evaluated on the basis of their area under the curve (AUC) in the
receiver operating characteristic analysis and balanced accuracy (i.e., mean
value of sensitivity and specificity). By utilizing a publicly accessible
dataset from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, we assessed the proposed
model and baseline approaches in the prediction of inpatient mortality.
Results: AutoScore-Imbalance outperformed baselines in terms of AUC and
balanced accuracy. The nine-variable AutoScore-Imbalance sub-model achieved the
highest AUC of 0.786 (0.732-0.839) while the eleven-variable original AutoScore
obtained an AUC of 0.723 (0.663-0.783), and the logistic regression with 21
variables obtained an AUC of 0.743 (0.685-0.800). The AutoScore-Imbalance
sub-model (using down-sampling algorithm) yielded an AUC of 0. 0.771
(0.718-0.823) with only five variables, demonstrating a good balance between
performance and variable sparsity. Conclusions: The AutoScore-Imbalance tool
has the potential to be applied to highly unbalanced datasets to gain further
insight into rare medical events and to facilitate real-world clinical
decision-making.

that (i) the tail probability of CCT can be well approximated by a standard
Cauchy distribution under much more relaxed conditions placed on individual
p-values instead of the original test statistics; (ii) the relaxation

decidable logic of functional dependence (LFD) with local dependence formulas
and dependence quantifiers. The language is interpreted over dependence models,
which are pairs of first-order structures with a set of available variable
assignments, also called a team. The team associated with a dependence model
can be seen as a labelled transition system over which LFD becomes a modal
logic, where the dependence quantifiers become modalities and local dependence
formulas are treated as special atoms. In this paper, we introduce appropriate
notions of bisimulation characterizing LFD (and some related logics) as a
fragment of first order logic (FOL), and show it is equivalent to a notion of
bisimulation along more standard lines proposed in arXiv:2102.10368 [cs.LO],
yet more efficient for bisimilarity-checking. Our main result is that LFD has
the finite model property (FMP), by a new application of Herwig's theorem on

  (Extended Version)","To appear in SRDS 2021. This is an extended version",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Anti-piracy is fundamentally a procedure that relies on collecting data from
the open anonymous population, so how to incentivize credible reporting is a
question at the center of the problem. Industrial alliances and companies are
running anti-piracy incentive campaigns, but their effectiveness is publicly
questioned due to the lack of transparency. We believe that full transparency
of a campaign is necessary to truly incentivize people. It means that every
role, e.g., content owner, licensee of the content, or every person in the open
population, can understand the mechanism and be assured about its execution
without trusting any single role.
  We see this as a distributed system problem. In this paper, we present Argus,
a fully transparent incentive system for anti-piracy campaigns. The groundwork
of Argus is to formulate the objectives for fully transparent incentive
mechanisms, which securely and comprehensively consolidate the different
interests of all roles. These objectives form the core of the Argus design,
highlighted by our innovations about a Sybil-proof incentive function, a
commit-and-reveal scheme, and an oblivious transfer scheme. In the
implementation, we overcome a set of unavoidable obstacles to ensure security
despite full transparency. Moreover, we effectively optimize several
cryptographic operations so that the cost for a piracy reporting is reduced to
an equivalent cost of sending about 14 ETH-transfer transactions to run on the
public Ethereum network, which would otherwise correspond to thousands of
transactions. With the security and practicality of Argus, we hope real-world
anti-piracy campaigns will be truly effective by shifting to a fully
transparent incentive mechanism.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) when being trained to generate images.
To perform real image editing, it requires an accurate mapping from the real

important yet difficult. An in-domain GAN inversion approach is recently
proposed to constraint the inverted code within the latent space by forcing the
reconstructed image obtained from the inverted code within the real image

deviate from the latent space significantly. To solve this problem, we propose
a force-in-domain GAN based on the in-domain GAN, which utilizes a
discriminator to force the inverted code within the latent space. The
force-in-domain GAN can also be interpreted by a cycle-GAN with slight
modification. Extensive experiments show that our force-in-domain GAN not only
reconstructs the target image at the pixel level, but also align the inverted

coarse-to-fine classification regimes, which presents new challenge for
classification. To address this, we propose BERT-based models. After training,
class similarity is sensible over the multi-class datasets, especially in the

between $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and platinum, a system of great importance for the
next generation of high-power and high-temperature electronic devices.
Specifically, we obtain interfacial atomic structures at different orientations
using our structure matching algorithm and compute their SBH using electronic
structure calculations based on hybrid density functional theory. The
orientation and strain of platinum are found to have little impact on the
barrier height. In contrast, we find that decomposed water (H.OH), which could
be present at the interface from Ga$_2$O$_3$ substrate preparation, has a
strong influence on the SBH, in particular in the ($\overline{2}$01)
orientation. The SBH can range from $\sim$2 eV for the pristine interface to
nearly zero for the full H.OH coverage. This result suggests that SBH of
$\sim$2~eV can be achieved for the Ga$_2$O$_3$($\overline{2}$01)/Pt junction
using the substrate preparation methods that can reduce the amount of adsorbed
water at the interface.

accelerate computational analysis of atomic structures. In this context,
reliable uncertainty estimates are important for assessing confidence in

produce badly calibrated uncertainty estimates and it is therefore crucial to
detect and handle uncertainty carefully. In this work we extend a message
passing neural network designed specifically for predicting properties of
molecules and materials with a calibrated probabilistic predictive
distribution. The method presented in this paper differs from previous work by
considering both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in a unified framework,
and by recalibrating the predictive distribution on unseen data. Through
computer experiments, we show that our approach results in accurate models for
predicting molecular formation energies with well calibrated uncertainty in and
out of the training data distribution on two public molecular benchmark
datasets, QM9 and PC9. The proposed method provides a general framework for
training and evaluating neural network ensemble models that are able to produce
accurate predictions of properties of molecules with well calibrated

restricted by the null hypothesis, which often is much simpler than models
defined under the alternative hypothesis. This is typically so when the
alternative hypothesis involves inequality constraints. However, existing score
tests address only jointly testing all parameters of interest; a leading
example is testing all ARCH parameters or variances of random coefficients
being zero or not. In such testing problems rejection of the null hypothesis
does not provide evidence on rejection of specific elements of parameter of
interest. This paper proposes a class of one-sided score tests for testing a
model parameter that is subject to inequality constraints. Proposed tests are
constructed based on the minimum of a set of $p$-values. The minimand includes
the $p$-values for testing individual elements of parameter of interest using
individual scores. It may be extended to include a $p$-value of existing score
tests. We show that our tests perform better than/or perform as good as
existing score tests in terms of joint testing, and has furthermore the added
benefit of allowing for simultaneously testing individual elements of parameter
of interest. The added benefit is appealing in the sense that it can identify a
model without estimating it. We illustrate our tests in linear regression
models, ARCH and random coefficient models. A detailed simulation study is
provided to examine the finite sample performance of the proposed tests and we
find that our tests perform well as expected.

high-entropy secret key; this key enables a series of cryptographic
enhancements and security properties, which are hard to achieve using
out-of-band (OOB) authentication. We first study a few vulnerabilities in
voice-based OOB authentication, in particular a combinatorial attack against
lazy users, which we analyze in the context of a secure email solution. We then
propose tackling public key authentication by solving the problem of ""secure

This method enables the automation of important KM tasks (e.g. key renewal and
future key pair authentications), reduces the impact of human errors, and lends
itself to the asynchronous nature of email and modern messaging. It also
provides cryptographic enhancements including multi-device synchronization and
secure secret storage/retrieval, and paves the path for forward secrecy,
deniability and post-quantum security. We also discuss the use of auditable

We take the impurity to have two internal spin states, where the $\uparrow$

orthogonality catastrophe, while the $\downarrow$ state is a bare
noninteracting particle. Introducing a Rabi coupling between the impurity
states therefore allows us to investigate the coupling between a discrete
spectral peak and the Fermi-edge singularity, i.e., between states with and
without a quasiparticle residue. Combining an exact treatment of the uncoupled
impurity Green's functions with a variational approach to treat the Rabi driven

scales as a non-trivial power of the Rabi drive at low temperatures. This
reflects the power law of the Fermi-edge singularity and, importantly, this
behavior is qualitatively different from the case of a mobile impurity
quasiparticle where the scaling is linear. We therefore argue that the scaling
law serves as an experimentally implementable probe of the orthogonality

a library for the description of scientific data according to the Open Standard

by hardware heterogeneity lies in the decoupling of data description in domain
sciences, such as plasma physics simulations, from concrete implementations in
hardware and IO. The streaming backend is provided by the ADIOS2 framework,
developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This paper surveys two
openPMD-based loosely-coupled setups to demonstrate flexible applicability and
to evaluate performance. In loose coupling, as opposed to tight coupling, two
(or more) applications are executed separately, e.g. in individual MPI
contexts, yet cooperate by exchanging data. This way, a streaming-based
workflow allows for standalone codes instead of tightly-coupled plugins, using
a unified streaming-aware API and leveraging high-speed communication
infrastructure available in modern compute clusters for massive data exchange.
We determine new challenges in resource allocation and in the need of

algorithms for NP-hard problems. This has been most successful for graphs of
low treewidth: Many problems admit fast algorithms relative to treewidth and
many of them are optimal under SETH. Fewer such results are known for more
general structure such as low clique-width and more restrictive structure such
as low deletion distance to a sparse graph class.
  Despite these successes, such results remain ""islands'' within the realm of
possible structure. Rather than adding more islands, we seek to determine the
transitions between them, that is, we aim for structural thresholds where the
complexity increases as input structure becomes more general. Going from
deletion distance to treewidth, is a single deletion set to a graph with simple
components enough to yield the same lower bound as for treewidth or does it
take many disjoint separators? Going from treewidth to clique-width, how much
more density entails the same complexity as clique-width? Conversely, what is
the most restrictive structure that yields the same lower bound?
  For treewidth, we obtain both refined and new lower bounds that apply already
to graphs with a single separator $X$ such that $G-X$ has treewidth $r=O(1)$,
while $G$ has treewidth $|X|+O(1)$. We rule out algorithms running in time
$O^*((r+1-\epsilon)^{k})$ for Deletion to $r$-Colorable parameterized by
$k=|X|$. For clique-width, we rule out time $O^*((2^r-\epsilon)^k)$ for
Deletion to $r$-Colorable, where $X$ is now allowed to consist of $k$
twinclasses. There are further results on Vertex Cover, Dominating Set and
Maximum Cut. All lower bounds are matched by existing and newly designed
algorithms.

contact, the immunological synapse (IS), with target cells, where they release
their lytic granules containing perforin/granzyme and cytokine containing
vesicles. During this process the cell repolarizes and moves the microtubule
organizing center (MTOC) towards the IS. In the first part of our work we
developed a a computational model for the molecular-motor-driven motion of the
MT cytoskeleton during T cell polarization and analyzed effects of cortical
sliding and capture-shrinkage mechanisms. Here we use this model to analyze the
dynamics of the MTOC repositioning in situations in which a) the IS is in an
arbitrary position with respect to the initial position of the MTOC and b) the
T cell has two IS at two arbitrary positions. In the case of one IS, we found
that the initial position determines which mechanism is dominant and that the
time of repositioning does not rise monotonously with the MTOC-IS distance. In
the case of two IS, we observe several scenarios that have also been reported
experimentally: the MTOC alternates stochastically (but with a well defined
average transition time) between the two IS; it wiggles in between the two IS
without transiting to one of the two; or it is at some point pulled to one of
the two IS and stays there. Our model allows to predict which scenario emerges
in dependency of the mechanisms in action and the number of dyneins present. We
report that the presence of capture-shrinkage mechanism at least in one IS is
necessary to assure the transitions in every cell configuration. Moreover, the
frequency of transitions does not decrease with the distance between the two IS
and is the highest when both mechanisms are present in both IS.

solar system bodies with low orbital inclinations and orbital semi-major axes
between 42.4 and 47.7 au. These objects likely formed \textit{in situ} and the
population has experienced minimal collisional modification since formation.
Using the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS) ensemble sample and
characterization, combined with constraints from deeper surveys and supported
by evidence from the Minor Planet Center catalog and the Deep Ecliptic Survey,
we determine the absolute magnitude $H_r$ distribution of the cold classical
belt from $H_r\simeq5$ to 12 (roughly diameters of 400 km to 20 km). We
conclude that the cold population's $H_r$ distribution exhibits an exponential
cutoff at large sizes. Exponential cutoffs at large sizes are not a natural
outcome of pair-wise particle accretion but exponentially tapered power-law
size distributions are a feature of numerical simulations of planetesimal
formation via a streaming instability. Our observation of an exponential cutoff
agrees with previous observational inferences that no large objects ($D \gtrsim
400$ km) exist in the cold population. We note that the asymptotic slope of the
$H_r$ distribution is consistent with $\alpha \sim 0.4$ and this asymptotic
slope is also found in streaming instability modelling of planetesimal
formation and is thus not necessarily associated with achieving collisional
equilibrium. Studies of the transneptunian region are providing the parameters
that will enable future streaming-instability studies to determine the initial
conditions of planetesimal formation in the $\approx$45 au region of the Sun's

stratosphere, the equatorial oscillation of its relative temperature structure
about the equator, is characterized by a quasi-period of 4.4 years. The
stratospheric wind field in Jupiter's equatorial zone has never been directly
observed. In this paper, we aim at mapping the absolute wind speeds in
Jupiter's equatorial stratosphere to quantify vertical and horizontal wind and
temperature shear. Assuming geostrophic equilibrium, we apply the thermal wind
balance using nearly simultaneous stratospheric temperature measurements
between 0.1 and 30 mbar performed with Gemini/TEXES and direct zonal wind
measurements derived at 1 mbar from ALMA observations, all carried out between
March 14th and 22nd, 2017. We are thus able to calculate self-consistently the
zonal wind field in Jupiter's stratosphere where the JEO occurs. We obtain
stratospheric map of the zonal wind speeds as a function of latitude and
pressure about Jupiter's equator for the first time. The winds are vertically
layered with successive eastward and westward jets. We find a 200 m/s westward
jet at 4 mbar at the equator, with a typical longitudinal variability on the
order of ~50 m/s. By extending our wind calculations to the upper troposphere,
we find a wind structure qualitatively close to the wind observed using
cloud-tracking techniques. Nearly simultaneous temperature and wind
measurements, both in the stratosphere, are a powerful tool for future
investigations of the JEO (and other planetary equatorial oscillations) and its
temporal evolution.

using machine learning to adjust for confounding when evaluating the causal

Progress has been made via proposals like targeted minimum loss estimation

obtained so long as both predictions converge (sufficiently fast) to the truth.
Focusing on partially linear regression models, we show that a specific

does not converge to the truth. The resulting tests and confidence intervals

  One main challenge is that the improvement of distinctive quality attributes
may require contrasting refactoring actions on an application, as for trade-off
between performance and reliability. In such cases, multi-objective
optimization can provide the designer with a wider view on these trade-offs
and, consequently, can lead to identify suitable actions that take into account
independent or even competing objectives.
  In this paper, we present an approach that exploits the NSGA-II
multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to search optimal Pareto solution
frontiers for software refactoring while considering as objectives: i)
performance variation, ii) reliability, iii) amount of performance
antipatterns, and iv) architectural distance. The algorithm combines randomly
generated refactoring actions into solutions (i.e., sequences of actions) and
compares them according to the objectives.
  We have applied our approach on a train ticket booking service case study,
and we have focused the analysis on the impact of performance antipatterns on
the quality of solutions. Indeed, we observe that the approach finds better
solutions when antipatterns enter the multi-objective optimization. In
particular, performance antipatterns objective leads to solutions improving the
performance by up to 15% with respect to the case where antipatterns are not
considered, without affecting the solution quality on other objectives.

to the usually unknown stoichiometry and local atomic ordering of the different
structures experimentally. In order to combat this, first-principles methods
have been coupled with statistical methods such as the Cluster Expansion
formalism in order to construct the energy hull diagram, which helps to
determine if an alloyed structure can exist in nature. Traditionally, density
functional theory (DFT) has been used in such workflows. In this work we
propose to use chemically accurate many-body variational Monte Carlo (VMC) and
diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) methods to construct the energy hull diagram of an
alloy system, due to the fact that such methods have a weaker dependence on the
starting wavefunction and density functional, scale similarly to DFT with the
number of electrons, and have had demonstrated success for a variety of
materials. To carry out these simulations in a high-throughput manner, we
propose a method called Jastrow sharing, which involves recycling the optimized
Jastrow parameters between alloys with different stoichiometries. We show that
this eliminates the need for extra VMC Jastrow optimization calculations and
results in a significant computational cost savings (on average 1/4 savings of
total computational time). Since it is a novel post-transition metal
chalcogenide alloy series that has been synthesized in its few-layer form, we
used monolayer $GaS_xSe_{1-x}$ as a case study for our workflow. By extensively
testing our Jastrow sharing procedure for monolayer $GaS_xSe_{1-x}$ and
quantifying the cost savings, we demonstrate how a pathway towards chemically
accurate high-throughput simulations of alloys can be achieved using many-body

tetrahedralization whose cells are classified as inside or outside the surface
by a graph neural network and an energy model solvable with a graph cut. Our
model, making use of both local geometric attributes and line-of-sight
visibility information, is able to learn a visibility model from a small amount
of synthetic training data and generalizes to real-life acquisitions. Combining
the efficiency of deep learning methods and the scalability of energy based

source model degrades when bumping into the high data density near decision
boundary in target domain. A common solution is to minimize the Shannon Entropy
to push the decision boundary away from the high density area. However, entropy
minimization also leads to severe reduction of prediction diversity, and
unfortunately brings harm to the domain adaptation. In this paper, we
investigate the prediction discriminability and diversity by studying the
structure of the classification output matrix of a randomly selected data
batch. We find by theoretical analysis that the prediction discriminability and
diversity could be separately measured by the Frobenius-norm and rank of the
batch output matrix. The nuclear-norm is an upperbound of the former, and a
convex approximation of the latter. Accordingly, we propose Batch Nuclear-norm
Maximization and Minimization, which performs nuclear-norm maximization on the
target output matrix to enhance the target prediction ability, and nuclear-norm
minimization on the source batch output matrix to increase applicability of the
source domain knowledge. We further approximate the nuclear-norm by
L_{1,2}-norm, and design multi-batch optimization for stable solution on large
number of categories. The fast approximation method achieves O(n^2)
computational complexity and better convergence property. Experiments show that
our method could boost the adaptation accuracy and robustness under three

quantum information theory, due in part to the fact that quantum strategies can
win the GHZ game with probability 1. It is possible that improved parallel
repetition bounds may find applications in this setting.
  Recently, Dinur, Harsha, Venkat, and Yuen [DHVY17] highlighted the GHZ game
as a simple three-player game, which is in some sense maximally far from the
class of multi-player games whose behavior under parallel repetition is well
understood. Dinur et al. conjectured that parallel repetition decreases the
value of the GHZ game exponentially quickly, and speculated that progress on
proving this would shed light on parallel repetition for general multi-player
(multi-prover) games.

prototypical aqueous salt solutions, NaI(aq) and tetrabutylammonium iodide,
TBAI(aq), with the latter being a strong surfactant. Considerably different
behavior is revealed: In the NaI(aq) solutions, water's 1b1 energy increases by
300 meV upon increasing the concentration near-saturation concentrations,
whereas for TBAI the energy decreases by about 0.7 eV upon formation of a
surface layer. The solute-induced effects on the solute binding energies are
quantified as well, as inferred from concentration-dependent energy shifts of
the I- 5p peak energy. For NaI(aq), an almost identical I- 5p shift is found as
for the water 1b1 binding energy, with a larger shift occurring in the opposite
direction for the TBAI(aq) solution. We show that this result in NaI(aq) can be
primarily assigned to a change of water's electronic structure in the solution
bulk. In contrast, apparent changes of the 1b1 energy for TBAI(aq) can be
related to changes of the solution work function which could arise from surface
molecular dipoles. Furthermore, for both of the solutions studied here, the
measured water 1b1 binding energies can be correlated with the extensive
solution molecular structure changes occurring at high salt concentrations,
where in the case of NaI(aq), too few water molecules exist to hydrate
individual ions and the solution adopts a crystalline-like phase. We also

permissible climate sensitivities and carbon cycle responses. We demonstrate
that the functional form of the climate emulator of the DICE-2016 model is fit

carbon as the original DICE-2016, but with a strongly reduced sensitivity to

of carbon in DICE-2016 is oversensitive to the discount rate, leading to
extreme comparative statics responses to changes in preferences.

passive flow control technique (slit through a circular cylinder) in the
laminar regime (Re=100-500). The slit width ratio S/D (slit width/diameter) on
the modified cylinder plays an essential role to control the vortex shedding.
The additional flow through the slit leads to the suppression of the global
instability and vortex shedding, whereas a large amount of flow through the
slit drastically alters the behavior of vortex shedding. The nature of vortex
shedding remains periodic for all S/D, and the root mean square (rms) value of
the lift coefficient decreases (in turn, vortex shedding suppression) with S/D
up to Re = 300. For the range Re > 300, the root mean square (rms) value of the
lift coefficient decreases up to S/D < 0.15, and the flow exhibits periodic
vortex shedding, while the root mean square (rms) increases beyond S/D > 0.15
due to irregular vortex shedding downstream of cylinder. The variation of the
Re for the S/D=0.20 shows bifurcation points where the flow changes its
behavior from symmetric to asymmetric solution at Re=232 and again becomes
symmetric at Re=304. The unsteady flow analysis over the modified cylinder also
indicates the suppression in the vortex shedding; however, the analysis
provides the qualitative property of suppression. The reduced order modeling,
i.e. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Dynamic Mode Decomposition

properties and the likelihood of infection with, or exposure to, foot-and-mouth

network shows properties of small-worldness and scale-freeness (intermediate
degrees), with an exponential cut-off for high degrees. The shipments network
illustrates strong modularity and lack of assortativity. The shipments network
shows signs of spatial constraints, with few long-distance connections, and a
strong similarity to other spatially constrained networks. We find that farms
that were either infected or at high risk of infection with FMD (within one
link from an infected farm) had higher values of centrality; farms that were
never less than 2 links from an infected farm had disproportionately low
centrality. However, the correlation of the rankings of farms shows that
central farms (high eigenvector centrality) are not necessarily those with more
connections to/from it (in/out degree). Several central farms serve as bridges
of densely connected farms (high betweenness centrality). These results suggest
that to detect FMD spread, surveillance efforts could be focused preferentially

and Trajectory knowledge (PARRoT). Short-term effects, as occurring in urban
surroundings, have shown to have a negative impact on the Reinforcement
Learning (RL)-based routing process. Therefore, we add a timer-based
compensation mechanism to the update process and introduce a hybrid Machine
Learning (ML) approach to classify Radio Environment Prototypes (REPs) with a
dedicated ML component and enable the protocol for autonomous context adaption.
The performance of the novel protocol is evaluated in comprehensive network
simulations considering different REPs and is compared to well-known
established routing protocols for Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs). The results
show, that CA-PARRoT is capable to compensate the challenges confronted with in
different REPs and to improve its Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) up to 23%
compared to PARRoT, and outperform established routing protocols by up to 50 %.

shear flow (Garg et al. Phy. Rev. Lett. 121, 024502, 2018) has offered an
explanation for the origin of elasto-inertial turbulence (EIT) which occurs at
lower Weissenberg ($Wi$) numbers. In support of this, we show using weakly
nonlinear analysis that the subcriticality found in Page et al. (Phys. Rev.
Lett. 125, 154501, 2020) is generic across the neutral curve with the
instability only becoming supercritical at low Reynolds ($Re$) numbers and high
$Wi$. We demonstrate that the instability can be viewed as purely elastic in
origin even for $Re=O(10^3)$, rather than `elasto-inertial', as the underlying
shear does not energise the instability. It is also found that the introduction
of a realistic maximum polymer extension length, $L_{max}$, in the FENE-P model
moves the neutral curve closer to the inertialess $Re=0$ limit at a fixed ratio
of solvent-to-solution viscosities, $\beta$. In the dilute limit ($\beta
\rightarrow 1$) with $L_{max} =O(100)$, the linear instability can brought down
to more physically-relevant $Wi\gtrsim 110$ at $\beta=0.98$, compared with the
threshold $Wi=O(10^3)$ at $\beta=0.994$ reported recently by Khalid et al.
(arXiv: 2103.06794) for an Oldroyd-B fluid. Again the instability is
subcritical implying that inertialess rectilinear viscoelastic shear flow is
nonlinearly unstable - i.e. unstable to finite amplitude disturbances - for
even lower $Wi$.

learning such equations in heterogeneous solids (e.g., due to phase separation)
is challenging. One such relationship is between composition and eigenstrain,
which governs the chemo-mechanical expansion in solids. In this work, we
developed a generalizable, physically-constrained image-learning framework to
algorithmically learn the chemo-mechanical constitutive law at the nanoscale
from correlative four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy and
X-ray spectro-ptychography images. We demonstrated this approach on
Li$_X$FePO$_4$, a technologically-relevant battery positive electrode material.
We uncovered the functional form of composition-eigenstrain relation in this
two-phase binary solid across the entire composition range (0 $\leq$ X $\leq$
1), including inside the thermodynamically-unstable miscibility gap. The
learned relation directly validates Vegard's law of linear response at the
nanoscale. Our physics-constrained data-driven approach directly visualizes the
residual strain field (by removing the compositional and coherency strain),
which is otherwise impossible to quantify. Heterogeneities in the residual
strain arise from misfit dislocations and were independently verified by X-ray
diffraction line profile analysis. Our work provides the means to
simultaneously quantify chemical expansion, coherency strain and dislocations
in battery electrodes, which has implications on rate capabilities and
lifetime. Broadly, this work also highlights the potential of integrating
correlative microscopy and image learning for extracting material properties

obtained for two cold air outbreak (CAO) events during Phase I of the Aerosol
Cloud meTeorology Interactions oVer the western ATlantic Experiment (ACTIVATE)
in February-March 2020. We study the two contrasting CAO cases by performing
LES and test the sensitivity of BL structure and clouds to large-scale forcings
and turbulent heat fluxes. Profiles of atmospheric state and large-scale
divergence and surface turbulent heat fluxes obtained from the reanalysis data
ERA5 agree reasonably well with those derived from ACTIVATE field measurements
for both cases at the sampling time and location. Therefore, we adopt the time
evolving heat fluxes, wind and advective tendencies profiles from ERA5
reanalysis data to drive the LES. We find that large-scale thermodynamic
advective tendencies and wind relaxations are important for the LES to capture
the evolving observed BL meteorological states characterized by the hourly ERA5
reanalysis data and validated by the observations. We show that the divergence
(or vertical velocity) is important in regulating the BL growth driven by
surface heat fluxes in LES simulations. The evolution of liquid water path is
largely affected by the evolution of surface heat fluxes. The liquid water path
simulated in LES agrees reasonably well with the ACTIVATE measurements.This
study paves the path to investigate aerosol-cloud-meteorology interactions
using LES informed and evaluated by ACTIVATE field measurements.

work considers an extension of this framework by combining Double Q-learning
(via Double DQN) and transfer learning. The motivation behind is that Double
Q-learning can alleviate the problem of overestimation of the action values
present in conventional Q-learning, while transfer learning can leverage
knowledge acquired by an expert model to accelerate learning in the MARL
setting. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in a realistic V2X setting, with
synthetic data generated based on a geometry-based propagation model that
incorporates location-specific geographical descriptors of the simulated

likelihood ratio optimization problem where the data distributions are written
explicitly via (local) Kernel Density Estimates (KDE). This is inspired by the
recent progress in contrastive learning and its relation to KDE. We define the
KDEs directly in feature space and forgo the requirement of invertibility of
the kernel feature mappings. In our approach, features are no longer optimized
for linear separability, as in the original GAN formulation, but for the more
general discrimination of distributions in the feature space. We analyze the
gradient of our loss with respect to the feature representation and show that
it is better behaved than that of the original hinge loss. We perform
experiments with the proposed KDE-based loss, used either as a training loss or
a regularization term, on both CIFAR10 and scaled versions of ImageNet. We use
BigGAN/SA-GAN as a backbone and baseline, since our focus is not to design the

confined by the two-body instantaneous interaction, the equation of motion for
the fermionic propagator is obtained in the Dyson form. Before making any
approximation, the interaction kernel is found to be decomposed into the static
and dynamical (time-dependent) contributions, while the latter translates to
the energy-dependent and the former maps to the energy-independent terms in the
energy domain. The three-fermion correlation function being the heart of the
dynamical part of the kernel is factorized into the two-fermion and one-fermion
ones. With the relaxed particle number constraint, the normal propagator is
coupled to the abnormal one via both the static and dynamical kernels, that is
formalized by introducing the generalized quasiparticle propagator of the
Gor'kov type. The dynamical kernel in the factorized form is associated with
the quasiparticle-vibration coupling (QVC) with the vibrations unifying both
the normal and pairing phonons. The QVC vertices are related to the variations
of the Hamiltonian of the Bogoliubov quasiparticles, which can be obtained by
the finite amplitude method.

arithmetic, is now available in commercial hardware. Using lower precision can
offer significant savings in computation and communication costs with
proportional savings in energy. Motivated by this, there has been a renewed
interest in mixed precision iterative refinement for solving linear systems
$Ax=b$, and new variants of GMRES-based iterative refinement have been
developed. Each particular variant with a given combination of precisions leads
to different condition number-based constraints for convergence of the backward
and forward errors, and each has different performance costs. The constraints
for convergence given in the literature are, as an artifact of the analyses,
often overly strict in practice, and thus could lead a user to select a more
expensive variant when a less expensive one would have sufficed.
  In this work, we develop a multistage mixed precision iterative refinement
solver which aims to combine existing mixed precision approaches to balance
performance and accuracy and improve usability. For an initial combination of
precisions, the algorithm begins with the least expensive approach and
convergence is monitored via inexpensive computations with quantities produced
during the iteration. If slow convergence or divergence is detected using
particular stopping criteria, the algorithm switches to use a more expensive,
but more reliable variant. A novel aspect of our approach is that, unlike
existing implementations, our algorithm first attempts to use ``stronger''
solvers for the solution update before resorting to increasing the
precision(s). In some scenarios, this can avoid the need to refactorize the
matrix in higher precision. We perform extensive numerical experiments on
random dense problems and problems from real applications which confirm the
benefits of the multistage approach.

theoretical foundation in order to explain the occurrence and formation of
vortices in non-collisional astrophysical plasmas. On the other hand, to apply
the latter in order to study the vorticity in the wakes of Venus and Mars. We
introduce two theorems and two corollaries, which may be applicable to any
non-collisional plasma system, that relate the vorticity to electromagnetic
variables such as the magnetic field and the electric current density. We also
introduce a toy vortex model for the wakes of non-magnetized planetary bodies.

Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft, we identify vortices in the wakes of
Venus and Mars in single spacecraft wake crossings. We also identify a spatial
coincidence between current density and vorticity maxima confirming the
consistency of our theorems and model. We conclude that vortices in
non-collisional magnetized plasmas are always linked to electric currents and
that both vortices and currents always coexist. This suggests that the
mechanism that produces this type of vortices is the mutual interaction between
the electric current and the magnetic field, that to a first approximation is
explained considering that plasma currents due to a non-zero net charge density
induce magnetic fields that modify the existing field and also produce a
helical field configuration that drives charged particles along helical

metric and Einstein tensor have convergent perturbation series representations
on a sufficiently large Robertson-Walker coordinate patch. We find the source
necessarily averages all pressures, everywhere, including the interiors of
compact objects. We demonstrate that our considerations apply (on appropriately
restricted spacetime domains) to the Kerr solution, the Schwarzschild
constant-density sphere, and the static de-Sitter sphere. From conservation of
stress-energy, it follows that material contributing to the averaged pressure
must shift locally in energy. We show that these cosmological energy shifts are
entirely negligible for non-relativistic material. In relativistic material,
however, the effect can be significant. We comment on the implications of this

  Equilibrium for Chores",,,,,"cs.GT cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Competitive equilibrium with equal income (CEEI) is considered one of the
best mechanisms to allocate a set of items among agents fairly and efficiently.
In this paper, we study the computation of CEEI when items are chores that are
disliked (negatively valued) by agents, under 1-homogeneous and concave utility
functions which includes linear functions as a subcase. It is well-known that,
even with linear utilities, the set of CEEI may be non-convex and disconnected,
and the problem is PPAD-hard in the more general exchange model. In contrast to
these negative results, we design FPTAS: A polynomial-time algorithm to compute
$\epsilon$-approximate CEEI where the running-time depends polynomially on
$1/\epsilon$.
  Our algorithm relies on the recent characterization due to Bogomolnaia et
al.~(2017) of the CEEI set as exactly the KKT points of a non-convex
minimization problem that have all coordinates non-zero. Due to this non-zero
constraint, naive gradient-based methods fail to find the desired local minima
as they are attracted towards zero. We develop an exterior-point method that
alternates between guessing non-zero KKT points and maximizing the objective
along supporting hyperplanes at these points. We show that this procedure must
converge quickly to an approximate KKT point which then can be mapped to an
approximate CEEI; this exterior point method may be of independent interest.
When utility functions are linear, we give explicit procedures for finding the
exact iterates, and as a result show that a stronger form of approximate CEEI
can be found in polynomial time. Finally, we note that our algorithm extends to
the setting of un-equal incomes (CE), and to mixed manna with linear utilities
where each agent may like (positively value) some items and dislike (negatively
value) others.

the state of each agent is binary and where players base their strategic
decisions on two, possibly competing, factors: the willingness to align with
the majority (conformism) and the aspiration of sticking with the own type
(stubbornness). We also consider a quadratic cost related to the rate at which
a change in the state happens: changing opinion may be a costly operation.
Depending on the parameters of the model, the game may have more than one Nash
equilibrium, even though the corresponding N-player game does not. Moreover, it
exhibits a very rich phase diagram, where polarized/unpolarized,
coherent/incoherent equilibria may coexist, except for T small, where the
equilibrium is always unique. We fully describe such phase diagram in closed
form and provide a detailed numerical analysis of the N-player counterpart of
the mean field game. In this finite dimensional setting, the equilibrium
selected by the population of players is always coherent (favoring the
subpopulation whose type is aligned with the initial condition), but it does
not necessarily minimize the cost functional. Rather, it seems that, among the
coherent ones, the equilibrium prevailing is the one that most benefits the
underdog subpopulation forced to change opinion.

Gum 31, because their 12CO (J=2-1)/12CO (J=1-0) intensity ratios are high. We

their morphology and velocity structures are very similar to the numerical
simulations conducted by the previous studies. We propose a scenario that the

statistics to learn useful behaviors without the cost of reward engineering.
However, a central challenge in unsupervised RL is to extract behaviors that
meaningfully affect the world and cover the range of possible outcomes, without
getting distracted by inherently unpredictable, uncontrollable, and stochastic
elements in the environment. To this end, we propose an unsupervised RL method
designed for high-dimensional, stochastic environments based on an adversarial
game between two policies (which we call Explore and Control) controlling a
single body and competing over the amount of observation entropy the agent
experiences. The Explore agent seeks out states that maximally surprise the
Control agent, which in turn aims to minimize surprise, and thereby manipulate
the environment to return to familiar and predictable states. The competition
between these two policies drives them to seek out increasingly surprising
parts of the environment while learning to gain mastery over them. We show
formally that the resulting algorithm maximizes coverage of the underlying
state in block MDPs with stochastic observations, providing theoretical backing
to our hypothesis that this procedure avoids uncontrollable and stochastic
distractions. Our experiments further demonstrate that Adversarial Surprise
leads to the emergence of complex and meaningful skills, and outperforms
state-of-the-art unsupervised reinforcement learning methods in terms of both

approximations are considered nearly impossible to carry out in detail for
systems with multiple degrees of freedom due to the difficulties of solving the
resulting two-point boundary value problems. However, recent developments have
extended the applicability to a broader range of systems and circumstances. The
most important advances are first to generate a set of real reference
trajectories using appropriately reduced dimensional spaces of initial
conditions, and second to feed that set into a Newton-Raphson search scheme to
locate the $exposed$ complex saddle trajectories. The arguments for this
approach were based mostly on intuition and numerical verification. In this
paper, the methods are put on a firmer theoretical foundation and then extended
to incorporate saddles $hidden$ from Newton-Raphson searches initiated with
real trajectories. This hidden class of saddles is relevant to tunneling-type
processes, but a hidden saddle can sometimes contribute just as much as or more
than an exposed one. The distinctions between hidden and exposed saddles
clarifies the interpretation of what constitutes tunneling for wave packets and

relationship, from which the governing partial differential equation (PDE) can
be recovered. PDEs are commonly solved numerically using the finite-difference
(FD) method, with stencils constructed from truncated Taylor series expansions
which, whilst typically providing good approximation of the PDE in the
space-time domain, often differ considerably from the original partial
differential in the wavenumber-frequency domain where the dispersion
relationship is defined. Consequentially, stable, high-order FD schemes may not
necessarily result in realistic wave behavior, commonly exhibiting numerical
dispersion: lagging high-frequency components as a product of discretization. A
method for optimizing FD stencil weightings via constrained minimization to
better approximate the partial derivative in the wavenumber domain is proposed,
allowing for accurate propagation with coarser grids than would be otherwise
possible. This was applied to second derivatives on a standard grid and first
derivatives on a staggered grid. To evaluate the efficacy of the method, a pair
of numerical simulations were devised to compare spatially-optimized stencils
with conventional formulations of equivalent extent. A spatially-optimized
formulation of the 1D acoustic wave equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions
is presented, evaluating performance at a range of grid spacings, examining the
interval between the theoretical maximum grid spacings for the conventional and
optimized schemes in finer detail. The optimized scheme was found to offer
superior performance for undersampled wavefields and heavily oversampled
wavefields. Staggered-grid first derivative stencils were then applied to the
P-SV elastic wave formulation, simulating seismic wave propagation for a
two-layer, water-over-rock model.

level, we have the simplified collaboration square model and advance
collaboration square model and at the micro level we have the operational level
model. These collaboration decision making models, with their mathematical

the collaboration strategies of stakeholders for achieving sustainable city
logistics operations attainable under non-chaotic situation and presumptions of

effective collaboration strategies for sustainable city logistics operations by
mitigating the uncertainty effect and understanding the theories behind the

classes.
  The model based on LR is considered as a baseline. Additionally, we
investigate its additive white noise augmentation and a multi-level stochastic
approach, deep-learning methods, hybrid frameworks (LR plus deep-learning), and
simple stochastic extensions of deep-learning and hybrid methods. The
assessment metrics considered are: root mean squared error, anomaly
cross-correlation, climatology, variance, frequency map, forecast horizon, and
computational cost.
  We found that the multi-level linear stochastic approach performs the best
for both short- and long-timescale forecasts. The deep-learning hybrid models
augmented by additive state-dependent white noise came second, while their
deterministic counterparts failed to reproduce the characteristic frequencies
in climate-range forecasts. Pure deep learning implementations performed worse
than LR and its noise augmentations. Skills of LR and its white noise extension
were similar on short timescales, but the latter performed better on long
timescales, while LR-only outputs decay to zero for long simulations.
  Overall, our analysis promotes multi-level LR stochastic models with memory
effects, and hybrid models with linear dynamical core augmented by additive
stochastic terms learned via deep learning, as a more practical, accurate, and
cost-effective option for ocean emulation than pure deep-learning solutions.
