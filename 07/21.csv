  Tables",,"10.1088/1538-3873/ac689e",,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The diffuse far-ultraviolet (FUV) background has received considerable
attention from astronomers since the 1970's. The initial impetus came from the
hope of detecting UV radiation from the hot intergalactic medium. The central
importance of the FUV background to the physics (heating and ionization) of the
diffuse atomic phases motivated the next generation of experiments. The
consensus view is that the diffuse FUV emission at high latitudes has three
components: stellar FUV reflected by dust grains (diffuse Galactic light or
DGL), FUV from other galaxies and the intergalactic medium (extra-galactic
background light or EBL) and a component of unknown origin (and referred to as
the ""offset"" component). During the1980's, there was some discussion that
decaying dark matter particles produced FUV radiation. In this paper I
investigate production of FUV photons by conventional sources: line emission
from Galactic Hot Ionized Medium, two-photon emission from the Galactic Warm
Ionized Medium and low-velocity shocks, and Lyman-beta fluorescence of hydrogen
at several locales in the Solar System (the interplanetary medium, the
exosphere and the thermosphere of Earth). I conclude that two thirds and
arguably all of the offset component can be explained by the sum of the
radiation from the processes listed above.

parameters $p$ is large due to its ability to break down complex models into
simpler components, thus enabling inference even when the full likelihood is
not tractable. Although there are a number of ways to formulate a valid
composite likelihood in the finite-$p$ setting, there does not seem to exist
agreement on how to construct composite likelihoods that are comp utationally
efficient and statistically sound when $p$ is allowed to diverge. This article
introduces a method to select sparse composite likelihoods by minimizing a
criterion representing the statistical efficiency of the implied estimator plus
an $L_1$-penalty discouraging the inclusion of too many sub-likelihood terms.
Conditions under which consistent model selection occurs are studied. Examples
illustrating the procedure are analysed in detail and applied to real data.

  Software Developers from Five Stakeholders","15th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software
  Engineering and Measurement, ESEM 2021 (camera-ready)",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Studies on developer productivity and well-being find that the
perceptions of productivity in a software team can be a socio-technical
problem. Intuitively, problems and challenges can be better handled by managing
expectations in software teams. Aim: Our goal is to understand whether the
expectations of software developers vary towards diverse stakeholders in
software teams. Method: We surveyed 181 professional software developers to
understand their expectations from five different stakeholders: (1)
organizations, (2) managers, (3) peers, (4) new hires, and (5) government and
educational institutions. The five stakeholders are determined by conducting
semi-formal interviews of software developers. We ask open-ended survey
questions and analyze the responses using open coding. Results: We observed 18
multi-faceted expectations types. While some expectations are more specific to
a stakeholder, other expectations are cross-cutting. For example, developers
expect work-benefits from their organizations, but expect the adoption of
standard software engineering (SE) practices from their organizations, peers,
and new hires. Conclusion: Out of the 18 categories, three categories are
related to career growth. This observation supports previous research that
happiness cannot be assured by simply offering more money or a promotion. Among
the most number of responses, we find expectations from educational
institutions to offer relevant teaching and from governments to improve job
stability, which indicate the increasingly important roles of these
organizations to help software developers. This observation can be especially
true during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Gutzwiller projected particle-hole excitations of the Fermi sea, introduced in
[B. Dalla Piazza et al., Nature Physics 11, 62 (2015)], with a modified
importance sampling. We check the reliability of the method by comparing the
$S(k,\omega)$ to exact diagonalization results for 18 sites and to the
two-soliton continuum of the Bethe Ansatz for 72 sites. We get an excellent
agreement in both cases. Detailed analysis of the finite-size effects shows
that the method captures the critical Wess-Zumino-Witten SU(3)$_1$ behavior and
reproduces the correct exponent, with the exception of the size dependence of
the weight of the bottom of the conformal tower. We also calculate the
single-mode approximation for the SU($N$) Heisenberg model and determine the
velocity of excitations. Finally, we apply the method to the SU(3)
Haldane-Shastry model and find that the variational method gives the exact wave
function for the lowest excitation at $k=\pm 2\pi/3$.

the plane. We extend our deformed link homology theory to braids by introducing
a monoidal dg 2-category of curved complexes of type $A$ singular Soergel
bimodules. Using this framework, we promote to the curved setting the
categorical colored skein relation from arXiv:2107.08117 and also the notion of
splitting map for the colored full twists on two strands. As applications, we
compute the invariants of colored Hopf links in terms of ideals generated by
Haiman determinants and use these results to establish general link splitting
properties for our deformed, colored, triply-graded link homology. Informed by
this, we formulate several conjectures that have implications for the relation
between (colored) Khovanov--Rozansky homology and Hilbert schemes.

While data warehouse technologies are quite a success story, there is still a
lack of information integration methods, especially if the data sources are
based on different data models or do not have a schema. Enterprise Information
Integration has to deal with heterogeneous data sources and requires up-to-date
high-quality information to provide a reliable basis for analysis and decision
making. The paper proposes virtual integration using the Typed Graph Model to
support schema mediation. The integration process first converts the structure
of each source into a typed graph schema, which is then matched to the mediated
schema. Mapping rules define transformations between the schemata to reconcile
semantics. The mapping can be visually validated by experts. It provides
indicators and rules to achieve a consistent schema mapping, which leads to
high data integrity and quality.

knowing what those goals are? Generic reinforcement learning agents could be
trained to behave altruistically towards others by rewarding them for
altruistic behaviour, i.e., rewarding them for benefiting other agents in a
given situation. Such an approach assumes that other agents' goals are known so
that the altruistic agent can cooperate in achieving those goals. However,
explicit knowledge of other agents' goals is often difficult to acquire. In the
case of human agents, their goals and preferences may be difficult to express
fully; they might be ambiguous or even contradictory. Thus, it is beneficial to
develop agents that do not depend on external supervision and learn altruistic
behaviour in a task-agnostic manner. We propose to act altruistically towards
other agents by giving them more choice and allowing them to achieve their
goals better. Some concrete examples include opening a door for others or
safeguarding them to pursue their objectives without interference. We formalize
this concept and propose an altruistic agent that learns to increase the
choices another agent has by preferring to maximize the number of states that
the other agent can reach in its future. We evaluate our approach in three
different multi-agent environments where another agent's success depends on
altruistic behaviour. Finally, we show that our unsupervised agents can perform
comparably to agents explicitly trained to work cooperatively, in some cases
even outperforming them.

a segmentation model trained on the labeled source domain to the unlabeled

suffering from large domain gaps that make it difficult to correctly align
discrepant features, especially in the initial training phase. To address this
issue, we propose a novel Dual Soft-Paste (DSP) method in this paper.
Specifically, DSP selects some classes from a source domain image using a
long-tail class first sampling strategy and softly pastes the corresponding
image patch on both the source and target training images with a fusion weight.
Technically, we adopt the mean teacher framework for domain adaptation, where
the pasted source and target images go through the student network while the
original target image goes through the teacher network. Output-level alignment
is carried out by aligning the probability maps of the target fused image from
both networks using a weighted cross-entropy loss. In addition, feature-level
alignment is carried out by aligning the feature maps of the source and target
images from student network using a weighted maximum mean discrepancy loss. DSP
facilitates the model learning domain-invariant features from the intermediate
domains, leading to faster convergence and better performance. Experiments on
two challenging benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DSP over
state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

view of standard quantization, this effective Newton constant is susceptible to
quantum fluctuations. This is similar to what happens to the cosmological
constant in the unimodular gravity where the trace part of the Einstein
equations is lost in a different way. Using analogy with the
Henneaux-Teitelboim covariant action for the unimodular gravity, we consider
different general-covariant actions resulting in these dynamics. This setup
allows one to formulate the Heisenberg uncertainty relations for the Newton
constant and canonically conjugated quantities. Unexpectedly, one of such
theories also promotes the Planck's quantum constant to a global degree of
freedom, which is subject to quantum fluctuations. Following analogy with the
unimodular gravity, we discuss non-covariant ""unimatter"" and ""unicurvature""
gravities describing the scale-free Einstein equations. Finally, we show that

(MCH2) system with random perturbation on the torus $\mathbb{T}^d$ ($d\geq1$).
The MCH2 system reduces to the Euler-Poincar\'{e} equation without considering
the averaged density, and to the two-component Euler-Poincar\'{e} system as the
potential energy term weaken to $L^2$ norm in the Lagrangian. First, we
establish the local well-posedness of strong pathwise solutions in the sense of
Hadamard for the MCH2 system driven by general nonlinear multiplicative noise.
Moreover, we prove that the data-to-solution map does not uniformly depend on
the initial data, assuming that the noise coefficients can be controlled by the
nonlocal terms of the system itself. Second, when the noise coefficients are in
the form of polynomial, say $c|f|^\delta f$ with $c\neq0$, we find that the
random noises with sufficiently large intensity parameters
$\delta_1\geq\frac{1}{2}$ and $\delta_2\geq1$ have a regularization effect on
the $t$-variable, which improves the local strong pathwise solutions to be
global-in-time ones. Note that the global existence problem with small
intensity $0\leq\delta_1<\frac{1}{2}$ and $0\leq\delta_2<1$ remains to be an
open problem. As a partial positive answer, we prove that, in the case of
$\delta_1=\delta_2=0$, the stochastic MCH2 system admits a unique global strong
pathwise solution with high probability for sufficiently small initial data.
Nevertheless, when $d=1$, we show that the solutions will break in finite time

`traditional' monolithic mirror telescope costs have scaled as aperture to the
2.5 power. The large multiple mirror telescopes built or in construction during

significant cost savings as a result, although it is unclear what power law
such structures follow. We discuss the implications of the current
cost-aperture size data on the proposed large telescope projects of the next

particular aspects of radar environment perception. First, the polar NDT (PNDT)

uncertainties and their representation in the scan-matching algorithm is
achieved. Second, the extension of PNDT to take into account the Doppler

in numerical simulations and real data processing, showing the ability to
decrease the localization error by a factor of 3 to 5, depending on the
scenario, with a negligible increase in computational complexity. Finally, a
DPNDT extension with the capability to compensate angular bias in array

linear and non-linear mechanical response of complex fluids, including the
yielding transition. There is an increasing urge to acquire detailed knowledge
of the deformation field that is effectively present across the sample during
these tests; at the same time, there is mounting evidence that the macroscopic
rheological response depends on the elusive microscopic behavior of the
material constituents. Here we employ a strain-controlled shear-cell with
transparent walls to visualize and quantify the dynamics of tracers embedded in
various cyclically sheared complex fluids, ranging from almost-ideal elastic to
yield stress fluids. For each sample, we use image correlation processing to
measure the macroscopic deformation field, and echo-Differential Dynamic
Microscopy to probe the microscopic irreversible sample dynamics in reciprocal
space; finally, we devise a simple scheme to spatially map the rearrangements
in the sheared sample, once again without tracking the tracers. For the yield
stress sample, we obtain a wave-vector dependent characterization of
shear-induced diffusion across the yielding transition, which is accompanied by
a three-order-of-magnitude speed-up of the dynamics and by a transition from
localized, intermittent rearrangements to a more spatially homogeneous and
temporally uniform activity. Our tracking free approach is intrinsically
multi-scale, can successfully discriminate between different types of dynamics,
and can be automated to minimize user intervention. Applications are many, as
it can be translated to other imaging modes, including fluorescence, and can be
used with sub-resolution tracers and even without tracers, for samples that
provide intrinsic optical contrast.

electromagnetic spectrum from radio until the very high energy gamma-ray
regime. The emission is not only highly variable on many time scales, but is
also periodic at all observed wavelengths. Periodic modulation was observed on
different time-scales, ranging from hours, over months to several years. The
subject of this article is a super-orbital, long-term modulation of ~4.6 years.
We review the observation of this periodic modulation at multiple wavelengths
and investigate systematic relationships between them. In particular, radio
observations reveal that the long-term modulation is a very stable feature of
the source. Observations at other wavelengths result in a phase-shift of the
modulation pattern that is a systematic function of energy. The stability of
this period favors a scenario in which the long-term modulation is the result
of a precessing jet giving rise to periodic changes in the Doppler factor,
beating with the orbital modulation of the accretion rate. We explain the
phase-shifts across energy bands in a scenario with shorter wavelengths
originating closer to the base of the presessing jet. A significant deviation
of the TeV emission from this trend possibly requires a different explanation
related to magnetic reconnection events.

several qualitatively new modes of actuation, including cylinders, irises, and

actuation. We confirm our designs with a combination of experiments and

scenarios for self-driving cars (SDCs). Simulation-based tests are safer than
in-field operational tests and allow detecting software defects before
deployment. However, these tests are very expensive and are too many to be run
frequently within limited time constraints. In this paper, we investigate test
case prioritization techniques to increase the ability to detect SDC regression
faults with virtual tests earlier. Our approach, called SDC-Prioritizer,
prioritizes virtual tests for SDCs according to static features of the roads we
designed to be used within the driving scenarios. These features can be
collected without running the tests, which means that they do not require past
execution results. We introduce two evolutionary approaches to prioritize the
test cases using diversity metrics (black-box heuristics) computed on these
static features. These two approaches, called SO-SDC-Prioritizer and
MO-SDC-Prioritizer, use single-objective and multi-objective genetic
algorithms, respectively, to find trade-offs between executing the less
expensive tests and the most diverse test cases earlier. Our empirical study
conducted in the SDC domain shows that MO-SDC-Prioritizer significantly
improves the ability to detect safety-critical failures at the same level of
execution time compared to baselines: random and greedy-based test case
orderings. Besides, our study indicates that multi-objective meta-heuristics
outperform single-objective approaches when prioritizing simulation-based tests
for SDCs. MO-SDC-Prioritizer prioritizes test cases with a large improvement in
fault detection while its overhead (up to 0.45% of the test execution cost) is
negligible.

and SDP3 performance optimizer. Specifically, the SDP3 data simulator generates
vivid wireless sensing datasets in a virtual environment, the SDP3 performance

balance between eddy and mean meridional fluxes. In winter, however, the eddy
flux itself acts to accelerate and decelerate the zonal flow in the Asian and
East Pacific regions, respectively. In a zonal mean sense, the residual of
these two is then balanced by the mean meridional flux. These features are
qualitatively captured by the CMIP6 suite of models in their control runs. With
warming, the CMIP6 ensemble shows that the flux budget changes in a
quantitative manner, in both the summer and winter seasons. Apart from the mean
meridional flux which is affected by the projected weakening of the Hadley
Cells, there are significant changes in eddy fluxes too. Notably, stationary
wave fluxes are affected in the Asian and East Pacific regions during the
summer and winter seasons, respectively. In the wintertime, extratropical wave
activity penetrating into the East Pacific almost shuts off due to a weakening
of the prevalent westerlies in the warming simulations. Whereas, in summer,
eddy fluxes in the Asian region are displaced upward and changes are observed
in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Specifically, rotational flow
around the Asian summer anticyclone weakens in the upper troposphere while
strengthening in the lower stratosphere. Concomitantly, eddy flux convergence
over the equatorial Indian Ocean decreases in the former and increases (by a
larger amount) in the latter. In fact, strengthening of summertime tropical and
subtropical stationary waves in the lower stratosphere with warming is not
restricted to the Asian sector but is observed over all longitudes.
Effectively, the magnitude of all terms in the upper tropospheric momentum flux
budget decreases with warming, and an ensemble mean continues to yield a
marginally westward annual and zonal mean equatorial zonal flow.

their users perform everyday tasks. One way robots can provide this assistance
is shared autonomy. Within shared autonomy, both the human and robot maintain
control over the robot's motion: as the robot becomes confident it understands
what the human wants, it increasingly intervenes to automate the task. But how
does the robot know what tasks the human may want to perform in the first
place? Today's shared autonomy approaches often rely on prior knowledge: for
example, the robot must know the set of possible human goals a priori. In the
long-term, however, this prior knowledge will inevitably break down -- sooner
or later the human will reach for a goal that the robot did not expect. In this
paper we propose a learning approach to shared autonomy that takes advantage of
repeated interactions. Learning to assist humans would be impossible if they
performed completely different tasks at every interaction: but our insight is
that users living with physical disabilities repeat important tasks on a daily
basis (e.g., opening the fridge, making coffee, and having dinner). We
introduce an algorithm that exploits these repeated interactions to recognize
the human's task, replicate similar demonstrations, and return control when
unsure. As the human repeatedly works with this robot, our approach continually
learns to assist tasks that were never specified beforehand: these tasks
include both discrete goals (e.g., reaching a cup) and continuous skills (e.g.,
opening a drawer). Across simulations and an in-person user study, we
demonstrate that robots leveraging our approach match existing shared autonomy
methods for known goals, and outperform imitation learning baselines on new

result in computation failure or significantly increase computing time. Such
elasticity means that virtual machines over the cloud can be preempted under a
short notice (e.g., hours or minutes) if a high-priority job appears; on the
other hand, new virtual machines may become available over time to compensate
the computing resources. Coded Storage Elastic Computing (CSEC) introduced by
Yang et al. in 2018 is an effective and efficient approach to overcome the
elasticity and it costs relatively less storage and computation load. However,
one of the limitations of the CSEC is that it may only be applied to certain
types of computations (e.g., linear) and may be challenging to be applied to
more involved computations because the coded data storage and approximation are
often needed. Hence, it may be preferred to use uncoded storage by directly
copying data into the virtual machines. In addition, based on our own
measurement, virtual machines on Amazon EC2 clusters often have heterogeneous
computation speed even if they have exactly the same configurations (e.g., CPU,

speed to minimize the overall computation time. Under this framework, we

similarities and differences in the tradeoff between statistical and

particular, we show that, for $p$ th order tensors, the tradeoff manifests in
an identical fashion as the Gaussian case when the noise has finite $4(p-1)$ th
moment. The difference in signal strength requirements, with or without
computational constraints, for us to estimate the singular vectors at the
optimal rate, interestingly, narrows for noise with heavier tails and vanishes
when the noise only has finite fourth moment. Moreover, if the noise has less
than fourth moment, tensor SVD, perhaps the most natural approach, is
suboptimal even though it is computationally intractable. Our analysis exploits
a close connection between estimating the rank-one spikes and the spectral norm
of a random tensor with iid entries. In particular, we show that the order of
the spectral norm of a random tensor can be precisely characterized by the
moment of its entries, generalizing classical results for random matrices. In
addition to the theoretical guarantees, we propose estimation procedures for
the heavy tailed regime, which are easy to implement and efficient to run.

cosmic relics today. Due to their high abundances, these relics can
significantly affect the evolution of the universe. For instance, massless
relics produce a shift $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ to the cosmic expectation of the
effective number of active neutrinos. Massive relics, on the other hand,
additionally become part of the cosmological dark matter in the later universe,
though their light nature allows them to freely stream out of potential wells.
This produces novel signatures in the large-scale structure (LSS) of the
universe, suppressing matter fluctuations at small scales. We present the first
general search for such light (but massive) relics (LiMRs) with cosmic
microwave background (CMB) and LSS data, scanning the 2D parameter space of
their masses $m_X$ and temperatures $T_X^{(0)}$ today. In the conservative

how these consistency conditions imply bounds on the Laplacian eigenvalues and

processes that cannot be studied in single stars. Understanding the orbital
evolution of binaries is essential in order to model the formation of compact
binaries. Here we focus our attention on studying orbital evolution driven by
angular momentum loss through stellar winds in massive binaries. We run a suite
of hydrodynamical simulations of binary stars hosting one mass losing star with
varying wind velocity, mass ratio, wind velocity profile and adiabatic index,
and compare our results to analytic estimates for drag and angular momentum
loss. We find that, at leading order, orbital evolution is determined by the
wind velocity and the binary mass ratio. Small ratios of wind to orbital
velocities and large accreting companion masses result in high angular momentum
loss and a shrinking of the orbit. For wider binaries and binaries hosting
lighter mass-capturing companions, the wind mass-loss becomes more symmetric,
which results in a widening of the orbit. We present a simple analytic formula
that can accurately account for angular momentum losses and changes in the
orbit, which depends on the wind velocity and mass ratio. As an example of our
formalism, we compare the effects of tides and winds in driving the orbital

dynamically protected from control errors, cross-talk, and stray fields.
Crucially, this edge protection relies purely on emergent dynamical symmetries
that are absolutely stable to generic coherent perturbations. This property is
special to quasiperiodically driven systems: as we demonstrate, the analogous
edge states of a periodically driven qubit-array are vulnerable to
symmetry-breaking errors and quickly decohere. Our work paves the way for
implementation of more complex dynamical topological orders that would enable

obtaining well-sampled PNLFs and the number of observed PNe scales with the
encompassed stellar mass. This means either disposing of wide-field
observations or focusing on the bright central regions of galaxies. In this
work we take this second approach and conduct a census of the PNe population in
the central regions of galaxies in the Fornax cluster, using VLT/MUSE data for
the early-type galaxies observed over the course of the Fornax3D survey. Using
such integral-field spectroscopic observations to carefully separate the
nebular emission from the stellar continuum, we isolated [OIII] 5007 {\AA}

outliers, and present a catalogue of 1350 unique PNe sources across 21

the entire observed PNLF observed while carefully accounting for the PNe

average distance to the Fornax cluster itself of 19.86 $\pm$ 0.32 Mpc

submillimeter, we utilize concurrent mid-IR (Spitzer) and X-ray (Chandra)
observations. The submillimeter emission lags less than $\delta t\approx30$
minutes behind the mid-IR data. However, the entire submillimeter flare was not
observed, raising the possibility that the time delay is a consequence of
incomplete sampling of the light curve. The decay of the submillimeter emission
is not consistent with synchrotron cooling. Therefore, we analyze these data
adopting an adiabatically expanding synchrotron source that is initially
optically thick or thin in the submillimeter, yielding time-delayed or
synchronous flaring with the IR, respectively. The time-delayed model is
consistent with a plasma blob of radius $0.8~R_{\text{S}}$ (Schwarzschild
radius), electron power-law index $p=3.5$ ($N(E)\propto E^{-p}$), equipartition
magnetic field of $B_{\text{eq}}\approx90$ Gauss, and expansion velocity
$v_{\text{exp}}\approx0.004c$. The simultaneous emission is fit by a plasma
blob of radius $2~R_{\text{S}}$, $p=2.5$, $B_{\text{eq}}\approx27$ Gauss, and
$v_{\text{exp}}\approx0.014c$. Since the submillimeter time delay is not
completely unambiguous, we cannot definitively conclude which model better
represents the data. This observation presents the best evidence for a unified
flaring mechanism between submillimeter and X-ray wavelengths and places
significant constraints on the source size and magnetic field strength. We show
that concurrent observations at lower frequencies would be able to determine if
the flaring emission is initially optically thick or thin in the submillimeter.

themselves with test particle orbits of fixed shape and orientation in the
combined field of an oblate central body (to which the particle is bound) and a
distant, inclined, companion which is captured to quadrupolar order. While
amply sufficient for satellites around planets on near-circular orbits, the
quadrupolar approximation fails to capture essential dynamical features induced
by a wide binary companion (be it a star, a planet or a black hole) on a fairly
eccentric orbit. With similar such astronomical settings in mind, we extend the
classical Laplace framework to higher multipoles, and map out the backbone of
stationary orbits, now complexified by the broken axial symmetry. Eccentric and
inclined Laplace equilibria, which had been presaged in systems of large enough
mutual inclination, are here delineated over a broad range of mutually inclined
perturbations. We recover them for test particles in the field of a hot Jupiter
and a wide eccentric stellar binary, highlighting their relevance for the
architecture of multi-planet systems in binaries. We then extend and deploy our
machinery closer to home, as we consider the secular dynamics of
Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) in the presence of a putative ninth planet. We
show how generalized Laplace equilibria seed islands for Trans-Neptunian
objects to be sheltered around, islands within chaotic seas which we capture
via Poincar$\'{e}$ sections, while highlighting a beautiful interplay between
Laplace and Kozai-Lidov secular dynamical structures. An eminently classical

of drive and interactions results in emerging parametric resonances, analogous
to a vertically driving pendulum. In particular, Arnold tongues appear when the
driving frequency matches $2\Delta_0/n$, with $n$ a natural number, and
$\Delta_0$ the equilibrium gap parameter. Inside the Arnold tongues we find a
commensurate time-crystal condensate which retains the $U(1)$ symmetry breaking
of the parent superfluid/superconducting phase and shows an additional
time-translational symmetry breaking. Outside these tongues, the synchronized
collective Higgs mode found in quench protocols is stabilized without the need
of a strong perturbation. Our results are directly relevant to cold-atom and
condensed-matter systems and do not require very long energy relaxation times
to be observed.

astronomy. Among the spin parameters, their orientations within the orbital
plane, $\phi_1$, $\phi_2$ and $\Delta \phi=\phi_1-\phi_2$, are critical for
understanding the prevalence of the spin-orbit resonances and merger recoils in
binary black holes. Unfortunately, these angles are particularly hard to
measure using current detectors, LIGO and Virgo. Because the spin directions
are not constant for precessing binaries, the traditional approach is to
measure the spin components at some reference stage in the waveform evolution,
typically the point at which the frequency of the detected signal reaches 20
Hz. However, we find that this is a poor choice for the orbital-plane spin
angle measurements. Instead, we propose measuring the spins at a fixed
dimensionless time or frequency near the merger. This leads to significantly
improved measurements for $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ for several gravitational wave
events. Furthermore, using numerical relativity injections, we demonstrate that
$\Delta \phi$ will also be better measured near the merger for louder signals
expected in the future. Finally, we show that numerical relativity surrogate
models are key for reliably measuring the orbital-plane spin orientations, even
at moderate signal-to-noise ratios like $\sim 30-45$.

reveal the binary's evolutionary history. In particular, the spin orientations
of the component black holes within the orbital plane, $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$,
can be used to identify binaries caught in the so-called spin-orbit resonances.
In a companion paper, we demonstrate that $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ are best
measured near the merger of the two black holes. In this work, we use these
spin measurements to provide the first constraints on the full six-dimensional
spin distribution of merging binary black holes. In particular, we find that
there is a preference for $\Delta \phi = \phi_1 - \phi_2 \sim \pm \pi$ in the
population, which can be a signature of spin-orbit resonances. We also find a
preference for $\phi_1 \sim -\pi/4$ with respect to the line of separation near
merger, which has not been predicted for any astrophysical formation channel.
However, the strength of these preferences depends on our prior choices, and we
are unable to constrain the widths of the $\phi_1$ and $\Delta \phi$
distributions. Therefore, more observations are necessary to confirm the
features we find. Finally, we derive constraints on the distribution of recoil
kicks in the population, and use this to estimate the fraction of merger
remnants retained by globular and nuclear star clusters. We make our spin and
kick population constraints publicly available.

constructed integral decompositions the interpretation of subordination. This
fact is preserved in two limit cases built into the generalized Cattaneo

random permutations that we consider are mainly constrained models, that is,
uniform permutations belonging to a given subset of the set of all
permutations. We often identify this subset using pattern-avoidance, focusing
on: permutations avoiding a pattern of length three, substitution-closed
classes, (almost) square permutations, permutation families encoded by
generating trees, and Baxter permutations. We explore some universal phenomena
for the models mentioned above. For Benjamini-Schramm limits we explore a
concentration phenomenon for the limiting objects. For permuton limits we
deepen the study of some known universal permutons, called biased Brownian
separable permutons, and we introduce some new ones, called Baxter permuton and
skew Brownian permutons. In addition, for (almost) square permutations, we
investigate the occurrence of a phase transition for the limiting permutons. On
the way, we establish various combinatorial results both for permutations and
other related objects. Among others, we give a complete description of the
feasible region for consecutive patterns as the cycle polytope of a specific
graph; and we find new bijections relating Baxter permutations, bipolar
orientations, walks in cones, and a new family of discrete objects called
coalescent-walk processes.

controllability and interpretability of the 3D-StyleGAN via style vectors
inherited form the original StyleGAN2 that are highly suitable for medical

feasibility with ~12,000 three-dimensional full brain MR T1 images, although it
can be applied to any 3D volumetric images. Furthermore, we explore different

an explicit $d^{O(1)}$-variate and degree $d$ polynomial $P_{d}\in VNP$ such
that if any depth four circuit $C$ of bounded formal degree $d$ which computes
a polynomial of bounded individual degree $O(1)$, that is functionally
equivalent to $P_d$, then $C$ must have size $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{d}\log{d})}$.
  The motivation for their work comes from Boolean Circuit Complexity. Based on
a characterization for $ACC^0$ circuits by Yao [FOCS, 1985] and Beigel and
Tarui [CC, 1994], Forbes, Kumar and Saptharishi [CCC, 2016] observed that
functions in $ACC^0$ can also be computed by algebraic
$\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuits (i.e., circuits of the form -- sums
of powers of polynomials) of $2^{\log^{O(1)}n}$ size. Thus they argued that a
$2^{\omega(\log^{O(1)}{n})}$ ""functional"" lower bound for an explicit
polynomial $Q$ against $\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuits would imply a
lower bound for the ""corresponding Boolean function"" of $Q$ against non-uniform
$ACC^0$. In their work, they ask if their lower bound be extended to
$\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuits.
  In this paper, for large integers $n$ and $d$ such that $\omega(\log^2n)\leq
d\leq n^{0.01}$, we show that any $\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuit of
bounded individual degree at most $O\left(\frac{d}{k^2}\right)$ that
functionally computes Iterated Matrix Multiplication polynomial $IMM_{n,d}$
($\in VP$) over $\{0,1\}^{n^2d}$ must have size $n^{\Omega(k)}$. Since Iterated
Matrix Multiplication $IMM_{n,d}$ over $\{0,1\}^{n^2d}$ is functionally in
$GapL$, improvement of the afore mentioned lower bound to hold for
quasipolynomially large values of individual degree would imply a fine-grained
separation of $ACC^0$ from $GapL$.

optimal mining model that maximizes profits of pools and miners. The model is a
two-stage Stackelberg game in which each stage forms a sub-game. In stage I,
pools are the leaders who assign a computing power to be consumed by miners. In
stage II, miners decide of their power consumption and distribution. They find
themselves in a social dilemma in which they must choose between mining in
solo, therefore prioritizing their individual preferences, and participating in
a pool for the collective interest. The model relies on a pool protocol based
on a simulated game in which the miners compete for the reward won by the pool.
The solutions for the stage I sub-game and the simulated protocol game are
unique and stable Nash equilibriums while the stage II sub-game leads to a
stable cooperative equilibrium only when miners choose their strategies
according to certain criteria. We conclude that the cooperative optimal mining
model has the potential to favor Bitcoin decentralization and stability.
Mainly, the social dilemma faced by miners together with the balance of
incentives ensure a certain distribution of the network computing power between
pools and solo miners, while equilibriums in the game solutions provide
stability to the system.

vortex excitations, thereby lowering the critical noise amplitude of the

are small, the case with high-$T_c$ SC in the cuprates. Thus IR fluctuations do

energy production of the hydro-power plant in a sub-daily operation, and,
simultaneously, to maximize the total water content (volume) of reservoirs. For
solving the problem, we discuss the Multi-objective Evolutionary Swarm
Hybridization (MESH) algorithm, a recently proposed multi-objective swarm
intelligence-based optimization method which has obtained very competitive
results when compared to existing evolutionary algorithms in specific
applications. The MESH approach has been applied to find the optimal water
discharge and the power produced at the maximum reservoir volume for all
possible combinations of turbines in a hydro-power plant. The performance of
MESH has been compared with that of well-known evolutionary approaches such as
NSGA-II, NSGA-III, SPEA2, and MOEA/D in a realistic problem considering data
from a hydro-power energy system with two cascaded hydro-power plants in
Brazil. Results indicate that MESH showed a superior performance than
alternative multi-objective approaches in terms of efficiency and accuracy,
providing a profit of \$412,500 per month in a projection analysis carried out.

fully consistent solutions of the one-dimensional Vlasov-Poisson equation for a

ion reflection forces experienced by the hole, there is generally only one

which represents an open chain, we obtain a simple bulk-edge correspondence:
the zero-energy modes localized at the ends of the chain are related to the
roots of a polynomial determined by the couplings of the Hamiltonian of the
bulk. From this result, we define an index that characterizes the different
topological phases of the system and can be easily computed by counting the
roots of the polynomial. As the defect is turned on and varied adiabatically,
the zero-energy modes may cross the energy gap and connect the valence and
conduction bands. We analyze the robustness of the connection between bands
against perturbations of the Hamiltonian. The pumping of states from one band
to the other allows the creation of particle-hole pairs in the bulk. An
important ingredient for our analysis is the transformation of the Hamiltonian

which leverages the likelihood-based Bayesian machine learning technique,
Bayesian additive regression trees, and uses Rubin's rule to combine the
estimates and variances of the variable importance measures on multiply imputed
datasets for variable selection in the presence of MAR data. We conduct a
representative simulation study to investigate the practical operating
characteristics of RR-BART, and compare it with the bootstrap imputation based
methods. We further demonstrate the methods via a case study of risk factors
for 3-year incidence of metabolic syndrome among middle-aged women using data
from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN). The simulation study
suggests that even in complex conditions of nonlinearity and nonadditivity with
a large percentage of missingness, RR-BART can reasonably recover both
prediction and variable selection performances, achievable on the fully
observed data. RR-BART provides the best performance that the bootstrap
imputation based methods can achieve with the optimal selection threshold
value. In addition, RR-BART demonstrates a substantially stronger ability of
detecting discrete predictors. Furthermore, RR-BART offers substantial
computational savings. When implemented on the SWAN data, RR-BART adds to the
literature by selecting a set of predictors that had been less commonly
identified as risk factors but had substantial biological justifications.

Despite its success, kNN is not without its problems. Mainly, it requires a
huge memory footprint to store all the training samples and it needs an
advanced data structure to allow for fast retrieval of the relevant examples,
given a query sample. We propose a neural network, termed kNet, that learns to

processing a query sample is a simple matter of inference. To use kNet, we
first train a preliminary network on the data set, and then train kNet on the

approximation of kNN,and cannot handle the sharp label changes between samples
that kNN can exhibit. This indicates that currently kNet is best suited to
approximate kNN with a fairly large k. Experiments on two data sets show that
this is the regime in which kNN works best,and can therefore be replaced by

of local thermal currents is demonstrated by harmonically coupled quantum
oscillators formulated by the Redfield quantum master equation (RQME) and the
Bose Hubbard model (BHM) of phonons formulated by the Lindblad quantum master
equation (LQME) using the simple multi-path geometry of a triangle. Driven by
two reservoirs at different temperatures, both systems can exhibit an atypical
local thermal current flowing against the total current. However, the total
thermal current behaves normally. While the RQME of harmonically coupled
quantum oscillators allows an analytical solution, the LQME of the interacting
BHM can be solved numerically. The emergence of the geometry-based circulation
in both systems demonstrates the ubiquity and robustness of the mechanism. In
the high-temperature limit, the results agree with the classical results,
confirming the generality of the geometric-based circulation across the quantum
and classical boundary. Possible experimental implications and applications are
briefly discussed.

accretion shock may develop which could (partially) alter the envelope material
entering the disk. Observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA) indicate that emission originating from warm SO and SO$_2$ might
be good tracers of such accretion shocks. The goal of this work is to test
under what shock conditions the abundances of gas-phase SO and SO$_2$ increase
in an accretion shock at the disk-envelope interface. Detailed shock models
including gas dynamics are computed using the Paris-Durham shock code for
non-magnetized J-type accretion shocks in typical inner envelope conditions.
The effect of pre-shock density, shock velocity, and strength of the
ultraviolet (UV) radiation field on the abundance of warm SO and SO$_2$ is
explored. Warm gas-phase chemistry is efficient in forming SO under most J-type
shock conditions considered. In lower-velocity (~3 km/s) shocks, the abundance
of SO is increased through subsequent reactions starting from thermally
desorbed CH$_4$ toward H$_2$CO and finally SO. In higher velocity (>4 km/s)
shocks, both SO and SO$_2$ are formed through reactions of OH and atomic S. The
strength of the UV radiation field is crucial for SO and in particular SO$_2$
formation through the photodissociation of H$_2$O. Thermal desorption of SO and
SO$_2$ ice is only relevant in high-velocity (>5 km/s) shocks at high densities
($>10^7$ cm$^{-3}$). Warm emission from SO and SO$_2$ is a possible tracer of
accretion shocks at the disk-envelope interface as long as a local UV field is
present. Additional observations with ALMA at high-angular resolution could
provide further constraints. Moreover, the James Webb Space Telescope will give
access to other possible slow, dense shock tracers such as H$_2$, H$_2$O, and

awareness about the consequences of modeling simplifications in these problems.
The inaccurate representation of Kirchhoff's voltage law under the premise of a

becomes intractable, and the literature lacks an accurate evaluation method of
different modeling alternatives. In this paper, we extend the state-of-the-art

relevant and practical new insights. First, we increase the quality of the
assessment by using an AC power flow to simulate and compare the performance of
five policies based on different network approximations. Second, we find that
the tightest network relaxation (based on semidefinite programming) is not the
one exhibiting the best performance. Results show that the DC {power flow} with
quadratic losses approximation exhibits the lowest expected cost and
inconsistency gaps. Finally, its computational burden is lower than that
exhibited by the semidefinite relaxation, whereas market distortions are

problem's search space, often trading off between exploitation and exploration.
Understanding how selection schemes affect exploitation and exploration within
a search space is crucial to tackling increasingly challenging problems. Here,
we introduce an ""exploration diagnostic"" that diagnoses a selection scheme's
capacity for search space exploration. We use our exploration diagnostic to
investigate the exploratory capacity of lexicase selection and several of its
variants: epsilon lexicase, down-sampled lexicase, cohort lexicase, and
novelty-lexicase. We verify that lexicase selection out-explores tournament
selection, and we show that lexicase selection's exploratory capacity can be
sensitive to the ratio between population size and the number of test cases
used for evaluating candidate solutions. Additionally, we find that relaxing
lexicase's elitism with epsilon lexicase can further improve exploration. Both
down-sampling and cohort lexicase -- two techniques for applying random
subsampling to test cases -- degrade lexicase's exploratory capacity; however,
we find that cohort partitioning better preserves lexicase's exploratory
capacity than down-sampling. Finally, we find evidence that novelty-lexicase's
addition of novelty test cases can degrade lexicase's capacity for exploration.
Overall, our findings provide hypotheses for further exploration and actionable
insights and recommendations for using lexicase selection. Additionally, this
work demonstrates the value of selection scheme diagnostics as a complement to
more conventional benchmarking approaches to selection scheme analysis.

confines of animal learning and associated with its crucial role in cultural
transmission and cultural evolution. Can imitation evolve as a form of
phenotypic plasticity in the absence of cultural transmission, in phenotypes
beyond behavior?
  We investigate a model in which imitation is unbundled from cultural
transmission: an organism's adult phenotype is plastically altered by its
experiences as a juvenile of other juveniles' genetically determined traits.
The only information transmitted between generations is genetic.
  We find that during a period of directional selection towards a phenotypic
optimum, natural selection favors modifiers which cause an organism to bias its
plastic phenotype in the direction opposite to the mean phenotype of the
population -- anti-imitation. As the population approaches the phenotypic
optimum and shifts into stabilizing selection, selection on the modifier
reverses and favors strong imitation of the population mean. Imitation can
evolve to overshoot the target and produce an evolutionary pathology where mean
fitness decreases. When purifying selection for an extreme phenotype is
modeled, only selection for anti-imitation occurs, even at a mutation-selection
balance.
  Imitation and anti-imitation emerge from these models in the absence of any
goal representation, cognitive understanding of its purpose, or discernment of
any kind. These theoretical outcomes are all novel evolutionary and biological
phenomena, and we discuss their implications.

projected onto the source plane with detailed lens models developed from high

the intrinsic stellar mass and star formation rate via SED fitting. In only one
of the sources are the three tracers robustly detected, while in the others
they are either undetected or detected in continuum only. The implied molecular
gass masses range from $4\times 10^{9}\,M_\odot$ in the detected source to an

inferred gas fraction and gas depletion timescale are found to lie
approximately 0.5 to 1.0 dex below the established scaling relations based on

machine-learned predictions to overcome worst case lower bounds. This area has
revealed interesting algorithmic insights into problems, with particular
success in the design of competitive online algorithms. However, the question
of improving algorithm running times with predictions has largely been
unexplored.
  We take a first step in this direction by combining the idea of
machine-learned predictions with the idea of ""warm-starting"" primal-dual
algorithms. We consider one of the most important primitives in combinatorial
optimization: weighted bipartite matching and its generalization to
$b$-matching. We identify three key challenges when using learned dual
variables in a primal-dual algorithm. First, predicted duals may be infeasible,
so we give an algorithm that efficiently maps predicted infeasible duals to
nearby feasible solutions. Second, once the duals are feasible, they may not be
optimal, so we show that they can be used to quickly find an optimal solution.
Finally, such predictions are useful only if they can be learned, so we show
that the problem of learning duals for matching has low sample complexity. We
validate our theoretical findings through experiments on both real and
synthetic data. As a result we give a rigorous, practical, and empirically
effective method to compute bipartite matchings.

structure enhances the photogeneration rate by increasing the absorption
probability of photons via back surface reflection, affording a second chance
for absorption. However, surface passivation and external luminescence effects
introduced by BSR structures have been previously ignored, which potentially
decreases the performance of TPV systems. Recently, a back gapped reflector
(BGR) structure was proposed to greatly improve the performance of far-field
TPV systems by reducing reflection loss at the semiconductor-metal interface.
In the present work, the performance improvement on a thin-film, near-field
InAs TPV system with a BGR is investigated, comparing its performance to that
with a conventional metal BSR. Surface passivation conditions are also

limit, orbits of a map degenerate to sequences of symbols and the dynamics is
reduced to the shift operator, a pure form of chaos. Under nondegeneracy
conditions, a contraction mapping argument can show that infinitely many AI
states continue to orbits of the deterministic map. For the 3D quadratic map,
the AI limit that we study is a quadratic correspondence whose branches, a pair
of one-dimensional maps, introduce symbolic dynamics on two symbols. The AI
states, however, are nontrivial orbits of this correspondence. The character of
these orbits depends on whether the quadratic takes the form of an ellipse, a
hyperbola, or a pair of lines. Using contraction arguments, we find parameter
domains for each case such that each symbol sequence corresponds to a unique AI
state. In some parameter domains, sufficient conditions are then found for each
such AI state to continue away from the limit to become an orbit of the
original 3D map. Numerical continuation methods extend these results, allowing
computation of bifurcations and obtaining orbits with horseshoe-like structures

optimizes performance on the analytics task within a rate constraint, instead
of the traditional rate-distortion framework which focuses on source
reconstruction. This paper considers a simple binary hypothesis testing
scenario where the resource constrained client (transmitter) performs
fixed-length single-shot compression on data sampled from one of two
distributions; the server (receiver) performs a hypothesis test on multiple
received samples to determine the correct source distribution. To this end, the
task-aware compression problem is formulated as finding the optimal source
coder that maximizes the asymptotic error performance of the hypothesis test on
the server side under a rate constraint. A new source coding strategy based on
a greedy optimization procedure is proposed and it is shown that that the
proposed compression scheme outperforms universal fixed-length single-shot
coding scheme for a range of rate constraints.

possess a non-trivial dependence on D: KK modes become heavy at large D,
whereas wrapped branes become light. This observation can be used either to
apply the Large Dimension Conjecture or, as we will do, to investigate the
possibility of a D-duality symmetry, which relates in gravity compactifications
of different dimensions. We will set up the general rules for D-duality in
higher dimensional gravity. However due to existence of the critical
dimensions, D-duality is quite restricted in string theory. As simple tests for
D-duality in string theory, we will discuss the duality between M-theory on a
two-dimensional orbifold, namely the M\""obius strip, and an IIB S-fold on a

that has low computation requirement at the edge device but has the
disadvantage of high communication overhead between edge device and server. To
reduce the communication overhead, this paper proposes a loss-based
asynchronous training scheme that updates the client-side model less frequently
and only sends/receives activations/gradients in selected epochs. To further
reduce the communication overhead, the activations/gradients are quantized
using 8-bit floating point prior to transmission. An added benefit of the
proposed communication reduction method is that the computations at the client
side are reduced due to reduction in the number of client model updates.
Furthermore, the privacy of the proposed communication reduction based split
learning method is almost the same as traditional split learning. Simulation
results on VGG11, VGG13 and ResNet18 models on CIFAR-10 show that the
communication cost is reduced by 1.64x-106.7x and the computations in the
client are reduced by 2.86x-32.1x when the accuracy degradation is less than
0.5% for the single-client case. For 5 and 10-client cases, the communication
cost reduction is 11.9x and 11.3x on VGG11 for 0.5% loss in accuracy.

general scheme of prior methods is to optimize two-view representations of

encoders to capture more abundant characteristics. To this end, we propose a

NeurObfuscator, a full-stack obfuscation tool to obfuscate the neural network
architecture while preserving its functionality with very limited performance
overhead. At the heart of this tool is a set of obfuscating knobs, including
layer branching, layer widening, selective fusion and schedule pruning, that
increase the number of operators, reduce/increase the latency, and number of

orchestrate the combination of obfuscating knobs to achieve the best
obfuscating effect on the layer sequence and dimension parameters so that the
architecture information cannot be successfully extracted. Results on sequence
obfuscation show that the proposed tool obfuscates a ResNet-18 ImageNet model
to a totally different architecture (with 44 layer difference) without
affecting its functionality with only 2% overall latency overhead. For
dimension obfuscation, we demonstrate that an example convolution layer with 64

diffuse halo gas, using observationally motivated orbits for the Magellanic
Clouds derived from HST proper motions within the potential of the Milky Way.
This model is able to reproduce the trailing arm but does not reproduce the
leading arm feature, which is common for models of the stream formation that
include ram pressure stripping effects. While our model does not outperform
other models in terms of matching the observable quantities in the MS, it is
close enough for our ultimate goal -- using the MS to estimate the MW mass.
From analyzing our grid of models, we find that there is a direct correlation
between the observed stream length in our simulations and the mass of the Milky
Way. For the observed MS length, the inferred Milky Way mass is $1.5 \pm 0.32
\times 10^{12}$ $M_\odot$, which agrees closely with other independent measures
of the Milky Way mass. We also discuss the MS in the context of HI streams in

from Hickson groups to the Virgo cluster. As a tracer of the dynamical mass in
the outer halo, the MS is a particularly valuable probe of the Milky Way's

formulation of a wide selection of industry-relevant products. To characterise
the viscoelastic behaviour of these soft materials, one can analyse the
microscopic dynamics of colloidal tracers diffusing through the host fluid and
generating local deformations and stresses. This technique, referred to as
microrheology, links the bulk rheology of fluids to the microscopic dynamics at
the particle scale. If tracers are subjected to external forces, rather than
freely diffusing, it is called active microrheology. Motivated by the impact of
microrheology in providing information on local structure in complex systems
such as colloidal glasses, active matter or biological systems, we have
extended the dynamic Monte Carlo (DMC) technique to investigate active
microrheology in colloids. The original DMC framework, able to accurately
describe the Brownian dynamics of colloids at equilibrium, is here reconsidered
and expanded to describe the effects of an external force pulling a tracer
embedded in isotropic colloidal suspensions at different densities. To this
end, we studied the dynamics of a spherical tracer dragged by a constant
external force through a bath of spherical and rod-like particles of comparable
size. We could extract valuable details on its effective friction coefficient,
being constant at small and large values of the external force, but otherwise
displaying a nonlinear behaviour that indicates the occurrence of a
force-thinning regime. Our DMC simulation results are in excellent quantitative
agreement with past Langevin dynamics simulations and theoretical works for the
bath of spherical colloids. The bath of rod-like particles is studied in the
isotropic phase, and displays an example where DMC is more convenient than
Brownian or Langevin dynamics, in this case in dealing with particle rotation.

scatterer and travel along the optic axis until arrive at a distant observer,

tuberculosis, and COVID-19. Manual investigations by human contact tracers
remain a dominant way in which this is carried out. This process is limited by
the number of contact tracers available, who are often overburdened during an
outbreak or epidemic. As a result, a crucial decision in any contact tracing
strategy is, given a set of contacts, which person should a tracer trace next?
In this work, we develop a formal model that articulates these questions and
provides a framework for comparing contact tracing strategies. Through
analyzing our model, we give provably optimal prioritization policies via a
clean connection to a tool from operations research called a ""branching

quantification (UQ) in systems describing complex spatiotemporal processes. Our
first objective is to identify the embedding of a set of high-dimensional data

For this purpose, we employ Grassmannian diffusion maps, a two-step nonlinear
dimension reduction technique which allows us to reduce the dimensionality of
the data and identify meaningful geometric descriptions in a parsimonious and
inexpensive manner. Polynomial chaos expansion is then used to construct a
mapping between the stochastic input parameters and the diffusion coordinates
of the reduced space. An adaptive clustering technique is proposed to identify
an optimal number of clusters of points in the latent space. The similarity of
points allows us to construct a number of geometric harmonic emulators which
are finally utilized as a set of inexpensive pre-trained models to perform an
inverse map of realizations of latent features to the ambient space and thus
perform accurate out-of-sample predictions. Thus, the proposed method acts as
an encoder-decoder system which is able to automatically handle very
high-dimensional data while simultaneously operating successfully in the
small-data regime. The method is demonstrated on two benchmark problems and on
a system of advection-diffusion-reaction equations which model a first-order
chemical reaction between two species. In all test cases, the proposed method
is able to achieve highly accurate approximations which ultimately lead to the
significant acceleration of UQ tasks.

combines the strengths of traditional hand-crafted controllers and model-free
deep reinforcement learning (RL). BCF thrives in the robotics domain, where
reliable but suboptimal control priors exist for many tasks, but RL from
scratch remains unsafe and data-inefficient. By fusing uncertainty-aware
distributional outputs from each system, BCF arbitrates control between them,
exploiting their respective strengths. We study BCF on two real-world robotics
tasks involving navigation in a vast and long-horizon environment, and a
complex reaching task that involves manipulability maximisation. For both these
domains, simple handcrafted controllers exist that can solve the task at hand
in a risk-averse manner but do not necessarily exhibit the optimal solution
given limitations in analytical modelling, controller miscalibration and task
variation. As exploration is naturally guided by the prior in the early stages
of training, BCF accelerates learning, while substantially improving beyond the
performance of the control prior, as the policy gains more experience. More
importantly, given the risk-aversity of the control prior, BCF ensures safe
exploration and deployment, where the control prior naturally dominates the
action distribution in states unknown to the policy. We additionally show BCF's
applicability to the zero-shot sim-to-real setting and its ability to deal with

quantum-optics-like experiments with single flying electrons employing their
spin or charge degree of freedom. For such quantum applications, highly
efficient trapping of the electron in a specific moving quantum dot (QD) of a
SAW train plays a key role. Probabilistic transport over multiple moving minima
would cause uncertainty in synchronisation that is detrimental for coherence of
entangled flying electrons and in-flight quantum operations. It is thus of
central importance to identify the device parameters enabling electron
transport within a single SAW minimum. A detailed experimental investigation of
this aspect is so far missing. Here we fill this gap by demonstrating
time-of-flight measurements for a single electron that is transported via a SAW
train between distant stationary QDs. Our measurements reveal the in-flight
distribution of the electron within the moving acousto-electric quantum dots of
the SAW train. Increasing the acousto-electric amplitude, we observe the
threshold necessary to confine the flying electron at a specific, deliberately
chosen SAW minimum. Investigating the effect of a barrier along the transport
channel, we also benchmark the robustness of SAW-driven electron transport
against stationary potential variations. Our results pave the way for highly
controlled transport of electron qubits in a SAW-driven platform for quantum
experiments.

concerns in computer systems. Typically, branch predictors are leveraged to
trigger mis-speculation in transient execution attacks. In this work, we
demonstrate a new class of speculation-based attack that targets branch
prediction unit (BPU). We find that speculative resolution of conditional
branches (i.e., in nested speculation) alter the states of pattern history
table (PHT) in modern processors, which are not restored after the
corresponding branches are later squashed. Such characteristic allows attackers
to exploit BPU as the secret transmitting medium in transient execution
attacks. To evaluate the discovered vulnerability, we build a novel attack
framework, BranchSpectre, that enables exfiltration of unintended secrets
through observing speculative PHT updates (in the form of covert and side
channels). We further investigate PHT collision mechanism in the history-based
predictor as well as the branch prediction mode transitions in Intel
processors. Built upon such knowledge, we implement an ultra high-speed covert
channel (BranchSpectre-cc) as well as two side channels (i.e., BranchSpectre-v1
and BranchSpectre-v2) that merely rely on BPU for mis-speculation trigger and
secret inference in the speculative domain. Notably, BranchSpectre side
channels can take advantage of much simpler code patterns than the ones used in
Spectre attacks. We present an extensive BranchSpectre code gadget analysis on
a set of popular real-world application code bases followed by a demonstration
of real-world side channel attack on OpenSSL. The evaluation results show
substantial wider existence and higher exploitability of BranchSpectre code
patterns in real-world software. Finally, we discuss several secure branch
prediction mechanisms that can mitigate transient execution attacks exploiting
modern branch predictors.

requires holistic integration of images, scripts, and sounds based on natural
language processing, temporal dependency, and reasoning. Recently, substantial
attempts have been made on several video datasets with associated question
answering (QA) on a large scale. However, existing evaluation metrics for video
question answering (VideoQA) do not provide meaningful analysis. To make
progress, we argue that a well-made framework, established on the way humans
understand, is required to explain and evaluate the performance of
understanding in detail. Then we propose a top-down evaluation system for
VideoQA, based on the cognitive process of humans and story elements: Cognitive
Modules for Evaluation (CogME). CogME is composed of three cognitive modules:
targets, contents, and thinking. The interaction among the modules in the
understanding procedure can be expressed in one sentence as follows: ""I
understand the CONTENT of the TARGET through a way of THINKING."" Each module
has sub-components derived from the story elements. We can specify the required
aspects of understanding by annotating the sub-components to individual
questions. CogME thus provides a framework for an elaborated specification of
VideoQA datasets. To examine the suitability of a VideoQA dataset for
validating video understanding intelligence, we evaluated the baseline model of
the DramaQA dataset by applying CogME. The evaluation reveals that story
elements are unevenly reflected in the existing dataset, and the model based on
the dataset may cause biased predictions. Although this study has only been
able to grasp a narrow range of stories, we expect that it offers the first
step in considering the cognitive process of humans on the video understanding

scale mixture model is a stochastic EMG model in which the EMG variance is
considered as a random variable, enabling the representation of uncertainty in
the variance. This model is extended in this study and utilized for EMG pattern
classification. The proposed method is trained by variational Bayesian
learning, thereby allowing the automatic determination of the model complexity.
Furthermore, to optimize the hyperparameters of the proposed method with a
partial discriminative approach, a mutual information-based determination
method is introduced. Simulation and EMG analysis experiments demonstrated the
relationship between the hyperparameters and classification accuracy of the
proposed method as well as the validity of the proposed method. The comparison
using public EMG datasets revealed that the proposed method outperformed the
various conventional classifiers. These results indicated the validity of the
proposed method and its applicability to EMG-based control systems. In EMG
pattern recognition, a classifier based on a generative model that reflects the
stochastic characteristics of EMG signals can outperform the conventional

model, there are two quantum phases: the phase of free impurity local moment
and the Kondo phase where this local moment is fully screened. The transition
between these two phases is under investigation. The work focuses mostly on the
case where the impurity is placed on top of a lattice site. In this case, the
full phase diagram is constructed using three parameters: the Hubbard
interaction $U$, the hybridization strength $v_0$ and the impurity energy level
$\epsilon_d$. The phase diagram exhibits linear $(U^c, \epsilon_d^c)$ phase
boundary, the slope of which, as well as the critical value $\epsilon_d^c$,
depends strongly on $v_0^2$. Further analysis shows that the real part of the
self energy at zero frequency and the impurity occupancy can help to understand
the behaviors of the phase boundaries. The dependence of the phase transition
on the impurity position is briefly discussed, revealing difficulties that one
needs to solve in order to realize the pseudogap Kondo model in the realistic

embedded devices present unique challenges to security analysts for the

dynamic analysis, which must have the ability to execute firmware code in

peripherals makes analysts have to frequently modify the emulator for executing
various firmware code in different virtualized environments, greatly limiting
the ability of security analysis.
  In this work, we explore the problem of firmware re-hosting related to the
real-time operating system (RTOS). Specifically, developers create a Board
Support Package (BSP) and develop device drivers to make that RTOS run on their

drivers, we can make the minimal modification of the firmware that is to be
migrated from its original hardware environment into a virtualized one. We show
that an approach capable of offering the ability to execute firmware at scale

flux-tracking behavior, i.e., the index increases/decreases with the flux
increasing/decreasing, implying that the distribution of the radiating

efficiency, and traffic flow. In this model, a set of vehicles move in line
formation and coordinate acceleration, braking, and steering using a
combination of physical sensing and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) messaging. The
authenticity and integrity of the V2V messages are paramount to safety. For
this reason, recent V2V and V2X standards support the integration of a PKI.
However, a PKI cannot bind a vehicle's digital identity to the vehicle's
physical state (location, velocity, etc.). As a result, a vehicle with valid
cryptographic credentials can impact platoons from a remote location.
  In this paper, we seek to provide the missing link between the physical and
the digital world in the context of vehicle platooning. We propose a new access
control protocol we call Proof-of-Following (PoF) that verifies the following
distance between a candidate and a verifier. The main idea is to draw security
from the common, but constantly changing environment experienced by the closely
traveling vehicles. We use the large-scale fading effect of ambient RF signals
as a common source of randomness to construct a {\em PoF} primitive. The
correlation of large-scale fading is an ideal candidate for the mobile outdoor
environment because it exponentially decays with distance and time. We evaluate
our PoF protocol on an experimental platoon of two vehicles in freeway,
highway, and urban driving conditions. We demonstrate that the PoF withstands
both the pre-recording and following attacks with overwhelming probability.

field, the electron cross-field (E$\times$B) flow relative to the unmagnetized

resonances of the ion acoustic mode and the electron cyclotron harmonics. This
occurs in collisionless shock ramps in space, and in $\rm{E \times B}$
discharge devices such as Hall thrusters. ECDI can induce an electron flow
parallel to the background E field at a speed greatly exceeding predictions by
classical collision theory. Such anomalous transport may lead to particle
thermalization at space shocks, and may cause unfavorable plasma flows towards
the walls of E$\times$B devices. The development of ECDI and anomalous
transport is often considered fully-kinetic. In this work, however, we
demonstrate that a reduced variant of this instability, and more importantly,
the associated anomalous transport, can be treated self-consistently in a
two-fluid framework without any collision. By treating electrons and ions on an
equal footing, the free energy allows the growth of an anomalous electron flow
parallel to the background E field. We first present linear analyses of the
instability in the two-fluid 5- and 10-moment models, and compare them against
the fully-kinetic theory. At lower temperatures, the two-fluid fastest-growing
mode is in good agreement with the kinetic result. Also, by including more
($>=10$) moments, secondary (and possibly higher) unstable branches can be
recovered. The dependence of the instability on various parameters is also
explored. We then carry out direct numerical simulations of the cross-field

be activated when initially activating vertices of $S$. In the Target Set

However, low-level features such as cepstrum coefficients have weak relation

magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images, to high-quality PET images. However,
such DNN methods focus on applications involving test data that match the
statistical characteristics of the training data very closely and give little
attention to evaluating the performance of these DNNs on new

(ii) the uncertainty in the DNN output through the per-voxel heteroscedasticity

that it is enough to characterize quantum states with different structure of

this work, we propose a novel Structure-Aware Long Short-Term Memory framework
(SA-LSTM) for efficient and accurate 3D landmark detection. To reduce the
computational burden, SA-LSTM is designed in two stages. It first locates the
coarse landmarks via heatmap regression on a down-sampled CBCT volume and then
progressively refines landmarks by attentive offset regression using
multi-resolution cropped patches. To boost accuracy, SA-LSTM captures
global-local dependence among the cropping patches via self-attention.
Specifically, a novel graph attention module implicitly encodes the landmark's
global structure to rationalize the predicted position. Moreover, a novel
attention-gated module recursively filters irrelevant local features and
maintains high-confident local predictions for aggregating the final result.
Experiments conducted on an in-house dataset and a public dataset show that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 1.64 mm and 2.37 mm
average errors, respectively. Furthermore, our method is very efficient, taking
only 0.5 seconds for inferring the whole CBCT volume of resolution
768$\times$768$\times$576.

research. This has led to the investigations of the subgroups of metric
ultraproducts of finite groups. This paper attempts to study the dual problem:
what are the quotients of ultraproducts of finite groups?
  Since an ultraproduct is an abstract quotient of the direct product, this
also led to a more general question: what are the abstract quotients of
profinite groups? Certain cases were already well-studied. For example, if we
have a pro-solvable group, then it is well-known that any finite abstract
quotients are still solvable.
  This paper studies the case of profinite groups from a surjective inverse
system of non-solvable finite groups. We shall show that, for various classes
of groups $\mathcal{C}$, any finite abstract quotient of a pro-$\mathcal{C}$
group is still in $\mathcal{C}$. Here $\mathcal{C}$ can be the class of finite
semisimple groups, or the class of central products of quasisimple groups, or
the class of products of finite almost simple groups and finite solvable
groups, or the class of finite perfect groups with bounded commutator width.
  Furthermore, in the case of finite perfect groups with unbounded commutator
width, we show that this is NOT the case. In fact, any finite group could be a
quotient of an ultraproduct of finite perfect groups. We provide an explicit
construction on how to achieve this for each finite group.

  We develop new techniques and extend some results of additive valuations to
general valuations on the existence of EFX allocations. We show that an EFX

versatile and robust methodology in recent times. However, a straightforward
extension of the classical elastohydrodynamic lubrication theory that is
commonly employed for characterizing elastic materials turns out to be rather
inadequate in explaining the response of such viscoelastic materials subjected
to dynamic loading conditions, despite adhering to a mathematically acceptable
framework via the complex Young's modulus as a material property. This deficit
stems from a non-trivial interplay of the material compressibility and its
time-dependent dynamic response under fluid-mediated oscillatory loading
typical to surface probing experiments. Here we develop a soft-lubrication
based theoretical framework that enables the consistent recovery of
viscoelastic model properties of materials from experimental data, independent
of the specific loading condition. A major advancement here is the
rectification of inconsistencies in viscoelasticity characterization of
previously reported models that are typically manifested by unphysical
dependencies of the model parameters on the substrate layer thickness and the
oscillation frequency of the surface probing apparatus. Our results provide
further pointers towards the design of characterization experiments for
consistent and specific mapping of the experimental data with the parametric
values of the chosen material-model. These findings appear to be imperative in

sizes shrink on relatively short timescales, implying that discs started much

the gas radius (as probed by CO rotational emission), to test disc evolution
models. In particular, we consider the ratio between the dust and gas radius,
$R_{\rm CO}/R_{\rm dust}$. We model the time evolution of protoplanetary discs
under the influence of viscous evolution, grain growth, and radial drift. Then,
using the radiative transfer code RADMC with approximate chemistry, we compute
the dust and gas radii of the models and investigate how $R_{\rm CO}/R_{\rm

mass, initial radius, and viscosity, $R_{\rm CO}/R_{\rm dust}$ becomes large
(>5) after only a short time (<1 Myr) due to radial drift. This is at odds with
measurements in young star forming regions such as Lupus, which find much
smaller values, implying that dust radial drift is too efficient in these
models. Substructures, commonly invoked to stop radial drift in large, bright
discs, must then be present, although currently unresolved, in most discs.

in realizing Bosonic condensation and superfluidity. The underlying
semiconductor's crystal asymmetry, if any, can be utilized to form anisotropic
half-light half-matter quasiparticles. We demonstrate generation of such highly
anisotropic exciton-polaritons at the interface of a biaxial layered
semiconductor, stacked on top of a distributed Bragg reflector. The spatially
confined photonic mode in this geometry couples with polarized excitons and
their Rydberg states, creating a system of highly anisotropic polariton
manifolds, displaying Rabi splitting of up to 68 meV. Rotation of the incident
beam polarization is used to tune coupling strength and smoothly switch regimes
from weak to strong coupling, while also enabling transition from one
three-body coupled oscillator system to another. Light-matter coupling is
further tunable by varying the number of weakly coupled optically active
layers. Our work provides a versatile method of engineering devices for
applications in polarization-controlled polaritonics and optoelectronics.

provide complementary information and microstructure details to improve the
operational performance and accuracy in brain surgery. However, compared to the
substantial image data, it is almost impossible to obtain the intraoperative 3D
shape information by using physical methods such as sensor scanning, especially
in minimally invasive surgery and robot-guided surgery. In this paper, a
general generative adversarial network (GAN) architecture based on graph
convolutional networks is proposed to reconstruct the 3D point clouds (PCs) of
brains by using one single 2D image, thus relieving the limitation of acquiring
3D shape data during surgery. Specifically, a tree-structured generative
mechanism is constructed to use the latent vector effectively and transfer
features between hidden layers accurately. With the proposed generative model,
a spontaneous image-to-PC conversion is finished in real-time. Competitive
qualitative and quantitative experimental results have been achieved on our

called it Shapiro resonance. In this work, using the spin-1 Gross-Pitaevskii
equation, we study the Shapiro resonance beyond the single-mode approximation
used in the previous work, which assumes that all components of the spinor
wavefunction have the same spatial configuration. Considering resonant dynamics
starting from a polar state, we analytically calculate the Floquet-Lyapunov
exponents featuring an onset of the resonance under a linear analysis and find
that spin waves with finite wavenumbers can be excited. This kind of
non-uniform excitation cannot be described by the single-mode approximation.
Furthermore, to study the long-time resonant dynamics beyond the linear
analysis, we numerically solve the one-dimensional spin-1 Gross-Pitaevskii

wavelengths of even multiples of the resonant one due to the nonlinear effect.

formulations for boundary value problems in nonlocal elasticity. For the sake
of simplicity, the focus is on an antiplane problem for a half-space for an
exponential kernel. First, a surface loading in the form of a travelling
harmonic wave is studied. This provides a counter-example, revealing that
within the framework of Eringen's theory the solution to the differential model
does not satisfy the equation of motion in nonlocal stresses underlying the
related integral formulation. A more general differential setup, starting from
singularly perturbed equations expressing the local stresses through the
nonlocal ones, is then investigated. It is emphasized that the transformation
of the original integral formulation to the differential one in question is
only possible provided that two additional conditions on nonlocal stresses hold
on the surface. As a result, the formulated problem subject to three boundary
conditions appears to be ill-posed. Next, the asymptotic solution of the
singularly perturbed problem, subject to a prescribed stress on the boundary,
together with only one of the aforementioned extra conditions, is obtained at a
small internal size. Three-term expansion is obtained, leading to a boundary
value problem in local stresses over interior domain. The associated
differential equations are identical to those proposed by Eringen, however, the
derived effective boundary condition incorporates the effect of a nonlocal
boundary layer which has previously been ignored. Moreover, the calculated
nonlocal correction to the classical antiplane problem for an elastic
half-space, coming from the boundary conditions is by order of magnitude
greater than that appearing in the equations of motion. Finally, it is shown
that the proposed effective condition supports an antiplane surface wave.

a set of processes and tools allow humans to better comprehend the decisions
generated by black box models. However, most of the available XAI tools are
often limited to simple explanations mainly quantifying the impact of
individual features to the models' output. Therefore, human users are not able
to understand how the features are related to each other to make predictions,
whereas the inner workings of the trained models remain hidden. This paper
contributes to the development of a novel graphical explainability tool that
not only indicates the significant features of the model but also reveals the
conditional relationships between features and the inference capturing both the
direct and indirect impact of features to the models' decision. The proposed
XAI methodology, termed as gLIME, provides graphical model-agnostic
explanations either at the global (for the entire dataset) or the local scale
(for specific data points). It relies on a combination of local interpretable
model-agnostic explanations (LIME) with graphical least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (GLASSO) producing undirected Gaussian graphical models.
Regularization is adopted to shrink small partial correlation coefficients to
zero providing sparser and more interpretable graphical explanations. Two
well-known classification datasets (BIOPSY and OAI) were selected to confirm
the superiority of gLIME over LIME in terms of both robustness and consistency
over multiple permutations. Specifically, gLIME accomplished increased
stability over the two datasets with respect to features' importance (76%-96%
compared to 52%-77% using LIME). gLIME demonstrates a unique potential to
extend the functionality of the current state-of-the-art in XAI by providing
informative graphically given explanations that could unlock black boxes.

compromises the disease diagnosis performance. To solve these problems, we
proposed a novel multimodal representation learning and adversarial hypergraph
fusion (MRL-AHF) framework for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis using complete
trimodal images. First, adversarial strategy and pre-trained model are
incorporated into the MRL to extract latent representations from multimodal
data. Then two hypergraphs are constructed from the latent representations and
the adversarial network based on graph convolution is employed to narrow the
distribution difference of hyperedge features. Finally, the hyperedge-invariant
features are fused for disease prediction by hyperedge convolution. Experiments
on the public Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative(ADNI) database
demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance on Alzheimer's disease

Employing low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and hybrid analog

structure employed at receiver is proposed for direction of arrival (DOA)

boundary condition. The first purpose is to establish the concept of quantum
cluster kink. We clarify that there are two types of cluster kinks since there
are two types of ground states depending on the choice of cluster length, of
which the first type exhibits symmetry breaking order and the second one string
order. Simple pictures are constructed according to the pure cluster model,
which facilitates us to introduce the quantity, cluster kink number. As we
demonstrate, cluster kinks deriving from different sources can coexist, compete
with each other, and lead to quantum phase transition in a mixed cluster model.
The second purpose is to elucidate that the effect of ring frustration can be
realized in the cluster model with symmetry breaking order, instead of the one
with string order. The reason lies in that ring frustration can induce a huge
ground-state degeneracy or a special extended-kink phase with gapless
excitations in the former case. And, although ring frustration does not change
the phase transition point, it can produce unusual ground state in the
extended-kink phase, whose special properties are uncovered by the nonlocal
scaling factor in the correlation function and the doubled degeneracies of the
eigenvalues of the entanglement spectrum.

aim at kernel SVM and propose adv-SVM to improve its adversarial robustness via
adversarial training, which has been demonstrated to be the most promising
defense techniques. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
devotes to the fast and scalable adversarial training of kernel SVM.
Specifically, we first build connection of perturbations of samples between
original and kernel spaces, and then give a reduced and equivalent formulation
of adversarial training of kernel SVM based on the connection. Next, doubly
stochastic gradients (DSG) based on two unbiased stochastic approximations

launched in the vicinity of the central engine (i.e. a supermassive black
hole), that are oriented close to our line of sight. Their peculiar orientation
makes them very efficient tracers of the overall jetted population, and due to
their brightness they can be visible up to very high redshifts. A deep
knowledge of these objects can provide fundamental clues to the models of
formation and growth of the first supermassive black holes, but their search in
the early Universe must be careful and follow a systematic approach. The
discovery in the last $\sim15$ years of extremely massive blazars at very high
redshifts ($M_{\rm BH}>10^9M_\odot, \, z>4$) revolutionized our perception of
their earliest evolution: there seem to be different formation epochs for
extremely massive black holes hosted in jetted ($z\sim4$) and non-jetted
systems ($z\sim2.5$). This is not easy to explain, since one would expect that
jetted sources accrete less efficiently. Small differences in the population
are also derived from the search of such high-$z$ sources: we will go through
the open questions in order to understand where the common knowledge stands and
which steps must be undertaken to better understand the formation and common

If one assumes that the primaries perform circular motions and that all three

(RPC3BP). In rotating coordinates, it can be modeled by a two degrees of
freedom Hamiltonian, which has five critical points called the Lagrange points
L1,.., L5.
  The Lagrange point L3 is a saddle-center critical point which is collinear
with the primaries and beyond the largest of the two. In this paper, we obtain
an asymptotic formula for the distance between the stable and unstable
manifolds of L3 for small values of the mass ratio $0<\mu\ll 1$. In particular
we show that L3 cannot have (one round) homoclinic orbits.
  If the ratio between the masses of the primaries $\mu$ is small, the
hyperbolic eigenvalues of L3 are weaker, by a factor of order $\sqrt\mu$, than
the elliptic ones. This rapidly rotating dynamics makes the distance between
manifolds exponentially small with respect to $\sqrt\mu$. Thus, classical
perturbative methods (i.e the Melnikov-Poincar\'e method) can not be applied.
  The obtention of this asymptotic formula relies on the results obtained in
the prequel paper on the complex singularities of the homoclinic of a certain
averaged equation and on the associated inner equation.
  In this second paper, we relate the solutions of the inner equation to the
analytic continuation of the parameterizations of the invariant manifolds of L3
via complex matching techniques. We complete the proof of the asymptotic
formula for their distance showing that its dominant term is the one given by
the analysis of the inner equation.

simulates a neutral evolutionary process with the restriction of having no
disappearing and added words. This work explains the mathematical framework of
the model - written as a Markov Chain with multinomial transition probabilities
- to show how frequencies of words change in time. From our observations in the
data and our model, word rank stability shows two types of characteristics: (1)
the increase/decrease in ranks are monotonic, or (2) the rank stays the same.
Based on our model, high-ranked words tend to be more stable while low-ranked
words tend to be more volatile. Some words change in ranks in two ways: (a) by
an accumulation of small increasing/decreasing rank changes in time and (b) by
shocks of increase/decrease in ranks. Most words in all of the languages we
have looked at are rank stable, but not as stable as a neutral model would
predict. The stopwords and Swadesh words are observed to be rank stable across
eight languages indicating linguistic conformity in established languages.

manner inconsistent with a purely neutral evolutionary process.

compound loss function that forces the samples to lie on the boundary. The BDSG

information for secondary uses, such as clinical events prediction or chronic
disease management. However, challenges exist for temporal data representation.
We therefore sought to identify these challenges and evaluate novel
methodologies for addressing them through a systematic examination of deep
learning solutions.
  Methods: We searched five databases (PubMed, EMBASE, the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers [IEEE] Xplore Digital Library, the
Association for Computing Machinery [ACM] digital library, and Web of Science)
complemented with hand-searching in several prestigious computer science
conference proceedings. We sought articles that reported deep learning
methodologies on temporal data representation in structured EHR data from
January 1, 2010, to August 30, 2020. We summarized and analyzed the selected
articles from three perspectives: nature of time series, methodology, and model
implementation.
  Results: We included 98 articles related to temporal data representation
using deep learning. Four major challenges were identified, including data
irregularity, data heterogeneity, data sparsity, and model opacity. We then
studied how deep learning techniques were applied to address these challenges.
Finally, we discuss some open challenges arising from deep learning.
  Conclusion: Temporal EHR data present several major challenges for clinical
prediction modeling and data utilization. To some extent, current deep learning
solutions can address these challenges. Future studies can consider designing
comprehensive and integrated solutions. Moreover, researchers should
incorporate additional clinical domain knowledge into study designs and enhance
the interpretability of the model to facilitate its implementation in clinical
practice.

generation of canned patterns is not only labor intensive but may also lack
diversity for supporting efficient visual formulation of a wide range of

framework called TATTOO that takes a data-driven approach to automatically
selecting canned patterns for a GUI from large networks. Specifically, it first
decomposes the underlying network into truss-infested and truss-oblivious
regions. Then candidate canned patterns capturing different real-world query
topologies are generated from these regions. Canned patterns based on a
user-specified plug are then selected for the GUI from these candidates by
maximizing coverage and diversity, and by minimizing the cognitive load of the

benefits of TATTOO. Importantly, this work takes a concrete step towards
realizing plug-and-play visual graph query interfaces for large networks.

in Ga-based materials by substituting N to other elements in the same main
group, which is of more broad applications. In this paper, based on
first-principles calculations, we performed a comprehensive study on the phonon
transport properties of 2D GaX (X = N, P, and As) with planar or buckled
honeycomb structures. The thermal conductivity of GaP (1.52 Wm-1K-1) is found
unexpectedly ultra-low, which is in sharp contrast to GaN and GaAs despite
their similar honeycomb geometry structure. Based on PJTE theory, GaP and GaAs
stabilize in buckling structure, different from the planar structure of GaN.
Compared to GaN and GaAs, strong phonon-phonon scattering is found in GaP due
to the strongest phonon anharmonicity. Given electronic structures, deep
insight is gained into the phonon transport that the delocalization of
electrons in GaP is restricted due to the buckling structure. Thus, non-bonding
lone pair electrons of P atoms induce nonlinear electrostatic forces upon
thermal agitation, leading to increased phonon anharmonicity in the lattice,
thus reducing thermal conductivity. Our study offers a fundamental
understanding of phonon transport in GaX monolayers with honeycomb structure,
which will enrich future studies of nanoscale phonon transport in 2D materials

to extract causal relations from natural language requirements in fine-grained

between causes and effects. They also do not allow to split causes and effects
into more granular text fragments (e.g., variable and condition), making the
extracted relations unsuitable for automatic test case derivation. [Objective &

described by the relativistic Dirac equation. In the limit of zero mass, its
parity-time symmetry enforces the Dirac fermion in the momentum space, which is
composed of two Weyl fermions with opposite chirality, to be non-chiral.
Inspired by the flavor symmetry in particle physics, we theoretically propose a
massless Dirac-like equation yet linking two Weyl fields with the identical
chirality by assuming SU(2) isospin symmetry, independent of the space-time
rotation exchanging the two fields. Dramatically, such symmetry is hidden in
certain solid-state spin-1/2 systems with negligible spin-orbit coupling, where
the spin degree of freedom is decoupled with the lattice. Therefore, the
existence of the corresponding quasiparticle, dubbed as flavor Weyl fermion,
cannot be explained by the conventional (magnetic) space group framework. The
four-fold degenerate flavor Weyl fermion manifests linear dispersion and a
Chern number of 2, leading to a robust network of topologically protected Fermi
arcs throughout the Brillouin zone. For material realization, we show that the
transition-metal chalcogenide CoNb3S6 with experimentally confirmed collinear
antiferromagnetic order is ideal for flavor Weyl semimetal under the
approximation of vanishing spin-orbit coupling. Our work reveals a counterpart
of the flavor symmetry in magnetic electronic systems, leading to further
possibilities of emergent phenomena in quantum materials.

of a galaxy. There are newly discovered GCs in the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf
galaxy, that can be used as probes of the accretion event onto the Milky Way
(MW). Our main aim is to characterize the Sgr GC system by measuring its main
physical parameters. We build the optical and near-IR color-magnitude diagrams
(CMDs) for 21 new Sgr GCs using the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea Extended
Survey (VVVX) near-IR database combined with the Gaia EDR3 optical database. We
derive metallicities and ages for all targets, using the isochrone-fitting
method and the RGB-slope and metallicity relation. The total luminosities are
calculated both in the near-IR and in the optical. We construct the metallicity
distribution (MD), the globular cluster luminosity function (GCLF), and the
age-metallicity relation for the Sgr GC system. We find 17 metal-rich GCs with
-0.9<[Fe/H]<-0.3, 4 metal-poor GCs with -2.0<[Fe/H]<-1.1 in the new Sgr GC
sample. Even though our age estimates are rough, we find that the metal-poor
GCs are consistent with an old population with an average age of ~13 Gyr, while
the metal-rich GCs show a wider age range, between 6-8 Gyr and 10-13 Gyr. We
compare the MD and the GCLF for the Sgr GC system with those of the MW, M31 and
Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) galaxies. We conclude that the majority of the
metal-rich GCs are located within the main body of Sgr galaxy. We confirm that
the GCLF is not a universal distribution, since the Sgr GCLF peaks at fainter
luminosities than the GCLFs of the MW, M31 and LMC. The MD shows a
double-peaked distribution, and we note that the metal-rich population looks
like the MW bulge GCs. We compared our results with the literature concluding
that the Sgr progenitor could have been a reasonably large galaxy able to
retain the SNe ejecta, thus enriching its ISM.

problems solved by the finite element method on some sufficiently fine mesh
with mesh size $h$. The error bound of the discrete GFEM approximation is
proved to converge as $h\rightarrow 0$ towards that of the continuous GFEM
approximation, which was shown to decay nearly exponentially in previous works.
Moreover, even for fixed mesh size $h$, a nearly exponential rate of
convergence of the local approximation errors with respect to the dimension of

the discrete eigenvalue problems is proposed by incorporating the discrete
$A$-harmonic constraint directly into the eigensolver. Numerical experiments

Recently, super-resolution methods have shown excellent performance in

novel super-resolution method that uses a generative adversarial network (GAN)
with cyclic loss and attention mechanism to generate high-resolution MR images

Structural similarity, peak signal to noise ratio, root mean square error, and
variance inflation factor were used as calculation indicators to evaluate the
performances of the proposed method. Various experimental results showed that
our method can better restore the details of the high-resolution MR image as

MR image can provide better lesion textures in the tumor patients, which is
promising to be used in clinical diagnosis.

  on Total Graphs",,,,,"math.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Hadwiger's conjecture is one of the most important and long-standing
conjectures in graph theory. Reed and Seymour showed in 2004 that Hadwiger's
conjecture is true for line graphs. We investigate this conjecture on the
closely related class of total graphs. The total graph of $G$, denoted by
$T(G)$, is defined on the vertex set $V(G)\sqcup E(G)$ with $c_1,c_2\in
V(G)\sqcup E(G)$ adjacent whenever $c_1$ and $c_2$ are adjacent to or incident
on each other in $G$. We first show that there exists a constant $C$ such that,
if the connectivity of $G$ is at least $C$, then Hadwiger's conjecture is true
for $T(G)$. The total chromatic number $\chi""(G)$ of a graph $G$ is defined to
be equal to the chromatic number of its total graph. That is,
$\chi""(G)=\chi(T(G))$. Another well-known conjecture in graph theory, the total
coloring conjecture or TCC, states that for every graph $G$,
$\chi""(G)\leq\Delta(G)+2$, where $\Delta(G)$ is the maximum degree of $G$. We
show that if a weaker version of the total coloring conjecture (weak TCC)
namely, $\chi""(G)\leq\Delta(G)+3$, is true for a class of graphs $\mathcal{F}$
that is closed under the operation of taking subgraphs, then Hadwiger's
conjecture is true for the class of total graphs of graphs in $\mathcal{F}$.
This motivated us to look for classes of graphs that satisfy weak TCC. It may
be noted that a complete proof of TCC for even 4-colorable graphs (in fact even
for planar graphs) has remained elusive even after decades of effort; but weak
TCC can be proved easily for 4-colorable graphs. We noticed that in spite of
the interest in studying $\chi""(G)$ in terms of $\chi(G)$ right from the
initial days, weak TCC is not proven to be true for $k$-colorable graphs even
for $k=5$. In the second half of the paper, we make a contribution to the
literature on total coloring by proving that $\chi""(G)\leq\Delta(G)+3$ for
every 5-colorable graph $G$.

Reinforcement Learning methodologies and the problem of exploration/coverage of
unknown terrains. Within this scope, MarsExplorer, an openai-gym compatible
environment tailored to exploration/coverage of unknown areas, is presented.
MarsExplorer translates the original robotics problem into a Reinforcement
Learning setup that various off-the-shelf algorithms can tackle. Any learned
policy can be straightforwardly applied to a robotic platform without an
elaborate simulation model of the robot's dynamics to apply a different
learning/adaptation phase. One of its core features is the controllable
multi-dimensional procedural generation of terrains, which is the key for
producing policies with strong generalization capabilities. Four different
state-of-the-art RL algorithms (A3C, PPO, Rainbow, and SAC) are trained on the
MarsExplorer environment, and a proper evaluation of their results compared to
the average human-level performance is reported. In the follow-up experimental
analysis, the effect of the multi-dimensional difficulty setting on the
learning capabilities of the best-performing algorithm (PPO) is analyzed. A
milestone result is the generation of an exploration policy that follows the
Hilbert curve without providing this information to the environment or
rewarding directly or indirectly Hilbert-curve-like trajectories. The
experimental analysis is concluded by evaluating PPO learned policy algorithm
side-by-side with frontier-based exploration strategies. A study on the
performance curves revealed that PPO-based policy was capable of performing
adaptive-to-the-unknown-terrain sweeping without leaving expensive-to-revisit
areas uncovered, underlying the capability of RL-based methodologies to tackle
exploration tasks efficiently. The source code can be found at:

offers an advantage in efficiently modelling long-range dependencies and

systems from TESS photometry. We search for binaries with and without
pulsations and determine their approximate ephemerides. Methods. Our selection
starts from a catalogue of dwarfs with colours corresponding to those of

aimed at detecting eclipsing binaries in the presence of strong pulsational

189 981 intermediate- to high-mass candidates, 91193 of which have light curves

on a FaaS platform. The FaaS platform is responsible for the resource
provisioning of the functions. Recently, there is a growing trend towards the
execution of compute-intensive FaaS functions that run for several seconds.
However, due to the billing policies followed by commercial FaaS offerings, the
execution of these functions can incur significantly higher costs. Moreover,
due to the abstraction of underlying processor architectures on which the
functions are executed, the performance optimization of these functions is
challenging. As a result, most FaaS functions use pre-compiled libraries
generic to x86-64 leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we examine
the underlying processor architectures for Google Cloud Functions (GCF) and
determine their prevalence across the 19 available GCF regions. We modify,
adapt, and optimize three compute-intensive FaaS workloads written in Python
using Numba, a JIT compiler based on LLVM, and present results wrt performance,
memory consumption, and costs on GCF. Results from our experiments show that
the optimization of FaaS functions can improve performance by 12.8x (geometric
mean) and save costs by 73.4% on average for the three functions. Our results
show that optimization of the FaaS functions for the specific architecture is
very important. We achieved a maximum speedup of 1.79x by tuning the function
especially for the instruction set of the underlying processor architecture.

the orthonormal circular Zernike polynomial basis to model the measured full

generation and uncontrollable power loads, make the optimization of power
system operation (PSO) challenging. A multi-period optimal PSO under
uncertainty is formulated using the chance-constrained optimization (CCO)
modeling paradigm, where the constraints include the nonlinear energy storage
and AC power flow models. Based on the emerging scenario optimization method
which does not rely on pre-known probability distribution functions, this paper
develops a novel solution method for this challenging CCO problem. The proposed
meth-od is computationally effective for mainly two reasons. First, the
original AC power flow constraints are approximated by a set of
learning-assisted quadratic convex inequalities based on a generalized least
absolute shrinkage and selection operator. Second, considering the physical
patterns of data and motived by learning-based sampling, the strategic sampling
method is developed to significantly reduce the required number of scenarios
through different sampling strategies. The simulation results on IEEE standard
systems indicate that 1) the proposed strategic sampling significantly improves
the computational efficiency of the scenario-based approach for solving the
chance-constrained optimal PSO problem, 2) the data-driven convex approximation
of power flow can be promising alternatives of nonlinear and nonconvex AC power
flow.

while preserving relevant information. However, the theoretical properties of
such algorithms, in particular the influence of hyperparameters and of the
graph structure on their convergence behaviour, have so far not been
well-understood. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis for
random-walks based embeddings techniques. Firstly, we prove that, under some
weak assumptions, vertex embeddings derived from random walks do indeed
converge both in the single limit of the number of random walks $N \to \infty$
and in the double limit of both $N$ and the length of each random walk
$L\to\infty$. Secondly, we derive concentration bounds quantifying the converge
rate of the corpora for the single and double limits. Thirdly, we use these
results to derive a heuristic for choosing the hyperparameters $N$ and $L$. We
validate and illustrate the practical importance of our findings with a range
of numerical and visual experiments on several graphs drawn from real-world
applications.

error estimates is proved in the framework of $L^2$-theory. The introduced
scheme maintains the advantages of the Lagrange-Galerkin method, i.e., CFL-free
robustness for convection-dominated problems and a symmetric and positive
coefficient matrix resulting from the discretization. In addition, the scheme
conserves the mass on the discrete level if the involved integrals are computed
exactly. Unconditional stability and error estimates of second order in time
are proved by employing two new key lemmas on the truncation error of the
material derivative in conservative form and on a discrete Gronwall inequality
for multistep methods. The mass-preserving property is achieved by the Jacobian
multiplication technique introduced by Rui and Tabata in 2010, and the accuracy
of second order in time is obtained based on the idea of the multistep Galerkin
method along characteristics originally introduced by Ewing and Russel in 1981.
For the first time step, the mass-preserving scheme of first order in time by
Rui and Tabata in 2010 is employed, which is efficient and does not cause any
loss of convergence order in the $\ell^\infty(L^2)$- and $\ell^2(H^1_0)$-norms.
For the time increment $\Delta t$, the mesh size $h$ and a conforming finite
element space of polynomial degree $k$, the convergence order is of $O(\Delta
t^2 + h^k)$ in the $\ell^\infty(L^2)\cap \ell^2(H^1_0)$-norm and of $O(\Delta

employed. Error estimates of $O(\Delta t^{3/2}+h^k)$ in discrete versions of

technologies for future 4D-tracking applications and recently have been
qualified to be used in the ATLAS and CMS timing detectors for the CERN High
Luminosity Large Hadron Collider upgrade.LGADs can achieve an excellent timing
performance by the presence of an internal gain that improves the
signal-to-noise ratio leading to a better time resolution. These detectors are
designed to exhibit a moderate gain with an increase of the reverse bias
voltage. The value of the gain strongly depends on the temperature. Thus, these
two values must be kept under control in the experiments to maintain the gain
within the required values. A reduction in the reverse bias or an increase in
the temperature will reduce the gain significantly. In this paper, a mechanism
for gain suppression in LGADs is going to be presented. It was observed, that
the gain measured in these devices depends on the charge density projected into
the gain layer, generated by a laser or a charged particle in their bulk.
Measurements performed with different detectors showed that ionizing processes
that induce more charge density in the detector bulk lead to a decrease in the
detector's measured gain. Measurements conducted with IR-laser and Sr-90 in the
lab, modifying the charge density generated in the detector bulk, confirmed
this mechanism and will be presented here.

with the SU(2)$_L$ triplet fermions, such as Wino DM in the supersymmetric
Standard Model. The Sommerfeld enhancement factor is approximately the same in
both systems, while our spin-1 DM predicts the larger annihilation cross

masses of DM and the heavy vector, and thus we have a chance to probe the mass
spectrum. The latest gamma-ray line search in the Galactic Center region gives

outburst. Based on the X-ray spectrum and variability, this evolution can be
divided into three canonical states: low/hard, intermediate and high/soft
state. BH LMXBs evolve from the low/hard to the high/soft state through the
intermediate state in some outbursts (here called ""full outbursts""). However,
in other cases, BH LMXBs undergo outbursts in which the source never reaches
the high/soft state, here called ""Failed-Transition outburst"" (FT outbursts).
From a sample of 56 BH LMXBs undergoing 128 outbursts, we find that $\sim$36%
of these BH LMXBs experienced at least one FT outburst, and that FT outbursts
represent $\sim$33% of the outbursts of the sample, showing that these are
common events. We compare all the available X-ray data of full and FT outbursts
of BH LMXBs from RXTE/PCA, Swift/BAT and MAXI and find that FT and full
outbursts cannot be distinguished from their X-ray light curves, HIDs or X-ray
variability during the initial 10-60 days after the outburst onset. This
suggests that both types of outbursts are driven by the same physical process.
We also compare the optical and infrared (O/IR) data of FT and full outbursts
of GX 339-4. We found that this system is generally brighter in O/IR bands
before an FT outburst, suggesting that the O/IR flux points to the physical
process that later leads to a full or an FT outburst. We discuss our results in
the context of models that describe the onset and evolution of outbursts in
accreting X-ray binaries.

  second-order statistics",,,,,"cs.DM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We present a new method for assessing and measuring homophily in networks
whose nodes have categorical attributes, namely when the nodes of networks come
partitioned into classes (colors). We probe this method in two different
classes of networks: i) protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, where nodes
correspond to proteins, partitioned according to their functional role, and
edges represent functional interactions between proteins ii) Pokec on-line
social network, where nodes correspond to users, partitioned according to their
age, and edges respresent friendship between users. Similarly to other
classical and well consolidated approaches, our method compares the relative
edge density of the subgraphs induced by each class with the corresponding
expected relative edge density under a null model. The novelty of our approach
consists in prescribing an endogenous null model, namely, the sample space of
the null model is built on the input network itself. This allows us to give
exact explicit expression for the z-score of the relative edge density of each
class as well as other related statistics. The z-scores directly quantify the
statistical significance of the observed homophily via Tchebycheff inequality.
The expression of each z-score is entered by the network structure through
basic combinatorial invariant such as the number of subgraphs with two spanning
edges. Each z-score is computed in O(n + m) time for a network with n nodes and
m edges. This leads to an overall efficient computational method for assesing
homophily. We complement the analysis of homophily/heterophily by considering
z-scores of the number of isolated nodes in the subgraphs induced by each
class, that are computed in O(nm) time. Theoretical results are then exploited
to show that, as expected, both the analyzed network classes are significantly
homophilic with respect to the considered node properties.

pedestrian flows in the setting of entropy solutions, which authorizes
non-classical shocks at the location of the so-called turning curve. We
consider linear cost functions, whose slopes $\alpha$ 0 correspond to different
crowd behaviours. We prove existence and partial well-posedness results in the
framework of entropy solutions. The proofs of existence are based on a a
sharply formulated many-particle approximation scheme with careful treatment of
interactions of particles with the turning curve, and on local reductions to
the well-known Lighthill-Whitham-Richards model. For the special case of
BV-regular entropy solutions without non-classical shocks, locally Lipschitz
continuous dependence of such solutions on the initial datum $\rho$ and on the
cost parameter $\alpha$ is proved. Differently from the stability argument and
from existence results available in the literature, our existence result allows
for the possible presence of non-classical shocks. First, we explore
convergence of the many-particle approximations under the assumption of uniform
space variation control. Next, by a local compactness argument that permits to
circumvent the possible absence of global BV bounds, we obtain existence of
solutions for general measurable data. Finally, we illustrate numerically that
the model is able to reproduce typical behaviours in case of evacuation.
Special attention is devoted to the impact of the parameter $\alpha$ on the
evacuation time.

dynamics obtained from an initial harmonic perturbation to established
theoretical predictions. With the addition of shear, three regimes have then
been evidenced as a function of the shear rate. In the case of low shear rates
the rupture is delayed when compared to the no-shear problem, while at higher
shear rates it is even suppressed: the perturbed interface goes back to its
unperturbed state over time. In between these two limiting regimes, a transient
one in which shear and vdW forces balance each other, leading to a
non-monotonic temporal evolution of the perturbed interface, has been
identified. While a linear analysis is sufficient to describe the rupture time

These techniques transform one or more elements of a speech signal, e.g.,

use advanced transformation tools to trigger a spoofing attack using fraudulent
biometrics for a legitimate speaker. Conversely, such techniques have been used
to generate privacy-transformed speech by suppressing personally identifiable
attributes in the voice signals, achieving anonymization. Prior works have
studied the security and privacy vectors in parallel, and thus it raises alarm
that if a benign user can achieve privacy by a transformation, it also means
that a malicious user can break security by bypassing the anti-spoofing
mechanism. In this paper, we take a step towards balancing two seemingly
conflicting requirements: security and privacy. It remains unclear what the
vulnerabilities in one domain imply for the other, and what dynamic
interactions exist between them. A better understanding of these aspects is
crucial for assessing and mitigating vulnerabilities inherent with VUIs and
building effective defenses. In this paper,(i) we investigate the applicability
of the current voice anonymization methods by deploying a tandem framework that
jointly combines anti-spoofing and authentication models, and evaluate the
performance of these methods;(ii) examining analytical and empirical evidence,
we reveal a duality between the two mechanisms as they offer different ways to

features from images for enabling detection of a vast amount of object types.
However, utilization of such backbones in object detection applications
developed for specific object types can unnecessarily over-process an extensive
amount of background. In addition, they are agnostic to object scales, thus
redundantly process all image regions at the same resolution. In this work we
introduce BLT-net, a new low-computation two-stage object detection
architecture designed to process images with a significant amount of background
and objects of variate scales. BLT-net reduces computations by separating
objects from background using a very lite first-stage. BLT-net then efficiently
merges obtained proposals to further decrease processed background and then
dynamically reduces their resolution to minimize computations. Resulting image
proposals are then processed in the second-stage by a highly accurate model. We
demonstrate our architecture on the pedestrian detection problem, where objects
are of different sizes, images are of high resolution and object detection is
required to run in real-time. We show that our design reduces computations by a
factor of x4-x7 on the Citypersons and Caltech datasets with respect to leading
pedestrian detectors, on account of a small accuracy degradation. This method
can be applied on other object detection applications in scenes with a

multilayer systems when placed on various dielectric substrates is predicted
with density functional theory based nonequilibrium Green's functions. Nonlocal
scattering of electrons on polar optical phonons, charged impurities and remote
scattering on phonons in the dielectric materials is included in the

depend on the layer thickness, temperature, doping concentration and

effective time-independent Floquet Hamiltonian, which describes the
stroboscopic evolution of a periodically driven quantum system in steps of the
driving period and which is routinely obtained analytically using
high-frequency expansions. The generalization of these concepts to open quantum
systems described by a Markovian master equation of Lindblad type turns out to
be non-trivial: On the one hand, already for a two-level system two different
phases can be distinguished, where the effective time-independent Floquet
generator (describing the stroboscopic evolution) is either again Markovian and
of Lindblad type or not. On the other hand, even though in the high-frequency
regime a Lindbladian Floquet generator (Floquet Linbladian) is numerically
found to exist, this behaviour is, curiously, not correctly reproduced within
analytical high-frequency expansions. Here, we demonstrate that a proper
Floquet Lindbladian can still be obtained from a high-frequency expansion, when
treating the problem in a suitably chosen rotating frame. Within this approach,
we can then also describe the transition to a phase at lower driving
frequencies, where no Floquet Lindbladian exists, and show that the emerging
non-Markovianity of the Floquet generator can entirely be attributed to the
micromotion of the open driven system.

of data and labels to achieve conditional data generation. Among them, the
auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network (AC-GAN) has been widely
used, but suffers from the problem of low intra-class diversity of the
generated samples. The fundamental reason pointed out in this paper is that the
classifier of AC-GAN is generator-agnostic, which therefore cannot provide
informative guidance for the generator to approach the joint distribution,
resulting in a minimization of the conditional entropy that decreases the
intra-class diversity. Motivated by this understanding, we propose a novel
conditional GAN with an auxiliary discriminative classifier (ADC-GAN) to
resolve the above problem. Specifically, the proposed auxiliary discriminative
classifier becomes generator-aware by recognizing the class-labels of the real
data and the generated data discriminatively. Our theoretical analysis reveals
that the generator can faithfully learn the joint distribution even without the
original discriminator, making the proposed ADC-GAN robust to the value of the
coefficient hyperparameter and the selection of the GAN loss, and stable during
training. Extensive experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the superiority of ADC-GAN in conditional generative modeling
compared to state-of-the-art classifier-based and projection-based conditional

second training step is then applied to diminish the gap between the source and

such human effort through an unsupervised progressive learning approach that
automatically assigns pseudo-labels to the non-annotated data. The evaluation
on different manuscript datasets show that our model can lead to competitive
results with a significant reduction in human effort. The code will be publicly

increases associated with the chiral symmetry restoration, and shows a jump at
the first order chiral phase transition. We plot the chiral phase diagram in
terms of the change of quark mass, the Mott transition of $\pi^0$ and the
minimum mass of $\sigma$. Due to the explicit breaking of chiral symmetry in

deeply study numerous strategies to perform video forecasting in

The prediction in the pixel space usually lacks the ability to preserve the
semantic and structure content of the video however the prediction in the
high-level feature space is prone to generate errors in the reduction and
recovering process. Therefore, we build a recurrent connection between
different feature spaces and incorporate their generations in the upsampling

half-distance between the two current layers respectively) necessary for non

is obtained. The latter threshold is independent of the details of the chosen
initial equilibrium (double Harris-like magnetic profile) and of the
resistivity. Its value is shown to be $4.7$, that is close and slightly smaller

  2021 Workshop Spotlight",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Scoring matching (SM), and its related counterpart, Stein discrepancy (SD)
have achieved great success in model training and evaluations. However, recent
research shows their limitations when dealing with certain types of
distributions. One possible fix is incorporating the original score matching
(or Stein discrepancy) with a diffusion matrix, which is called diffusion score
matching (DSM) (or diffusion Stein discrepancy (DSD)). However, the lack of
interpretation of the diffusion limits its usage within simple distributions
and manually chosen matrix. In this work, we plan to fill this gap by
interpreting the diffusion matrix using normalizing flows. Specifically, we
theoretically prove that DSM (or DSD) is equivalent to the original score
matching (or Stein discrepancy) evaluated in the transformed space defined by
the normalizing flow, where the diffusion matrix is the inverse of the flow's
Jacobian matrix. In addition, we also build its connection to Riemannian
manifolds and further extend it to continuous flows, where the change of DSM is
characterized by an ODE.

charges where plasma potential is lower than the biased electrode. Here an
improved understanding of electron sheath theory is provided using both fluid
and kinetic approaches while elaborating on its implications for plasma-surface
interaction. A fluid model is first proposed considering the electron presheath
structure, avoiding the singularity in electron sheath Child-Langmuir law. The
latter is proved to underestimate the sheath potential. Subsequently, the
kinetic model of electron sheath is established, showing considerably different
sheath profiles in respect to the fluid model due to the electron velocity
distribution function and finite ion temperature. The model is then further
generalized involving a more realistic truncated ion velocity distribution
function. It is demonstrated that such distribution function yields a
super-thermal electron sheath whose entering velocity at sheath edge is greater
than that prescribed by the Bohm criterion, implying a potentially omitted
calibration issue in the probe measurement. Furthermore, an attempt is made to
incorporate the self-consistent presheath-sheath match within the kinetic
framework, showing a necessary compromise between realistic sheath entrance and
the inclusion of kinetic effects. In the end, the consequent secondary electron
emission due to sheath-accelerated plasma electrons in electron sheath are
analyzed, providing a sheath potential coupled with the plasma and wall

the possibility of observing such condensed matter systems in the astrophysics
of extreme magnetic sources such as neutron stars, the physical systems in this

the eigenvalue problem for the single-particle Dirac Hamiltonian. In the
strong-field/small-radius limit, the spectrum of the spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$

$|m|\ll Q$ regime. It features a new, additional (approximately) zero-energy
lowest Landau level which persists into the $|m|<Q$ regime. As in the spinless

assumed degree distribution. Fitting a degree distribution to network data is
challenging, in particular for scale-free networks with power-law degrees. In
this paper we develop robust subgraph counts that do not depend on the entire
degree distribution, but only on the mean and mean absolute deviation (MAD),
summary statistics that are easy to obtain for most real-world networks. By
solving an optimization problem, we provide tight (the sharpest possible)
bounds for the subgraph counts, for all possible subgraphs, and for all
networks with degree distributions that share the same mean and MAD. We
identify the extremal random graph that attains the tight bounds as the graph
with a specific three-point degree distribution. We leverage the bounds to
obtain robust scaling laws for how the numbers of subgraphs grow as function of
the network size. The scaling laws indicate that sparse power-law networks are

description of a subset of the objects in the derived category in terms of
curves in the surface and their Homs in terms of intersection. By using the
description of these derived categories as the global sections of perverse
schobers, we arrive at the geometric model through gluing local data. Most
results also hold for the perverse schobers defined over any commutative ring
spectrum. As an application of the geometric model in the case $n=3$, we match
some Ext-groups in the derived categories of these relative Ginzburg algebras
and the extended mutation matrices of a class of cluster algebras with
coefficients, associated to multi-laminated marked surfaces by Fomin-Thurston.
Finally, we also consider a modified version of the perverse schober for
triangulated surfaces with punctures.

compliance as a static behavior, we propose a game-theoretic model to study

planner interacts with a sequence of heterogeneous agents who arrive with their
unobserved private type that determines both their prior preferences across the
actions (e.g., control and treatment) and their baseline rewards without taking
any treatment. The planner provides each agent with a randomized recommendation
that may alter their beliefs and their action selection. We develop a novel
recommendation mechanism that views the planner's recommendation as a form of
instrumental variable (IV) that only affects an agents' action selection, but
not the observed rewards. We construct such IVs by carefully mapping the
history -- the interactions between the planner and the previous agents -- to a
random recommendation. Even though the initial agents may be completely
non-compliant, our mechanism can incentivize compliance over time, thereby
enabling the estimation of the treatment effect of each treatment, and
minimizing the cumulative regret of the planner whose goal is to identify the
optimal treatment.

theory of the inverse scattering, the matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem is
established. Through the dressing method, the solution matrix with simple zeros
without reflection is constructed. In particular, a new form of solution is

through the determinant solution matrix, the vivid diagrams and dynamic

  2022). 57 pages",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This work introduces a novel principle we call disentanglement via mechanism
sparsity regularization, which can be applied when the latent factors of
interest depend sparsely on past latent factors and/or observed auxiliary
variables. We propose a representation learning method that induces
disentanglement by simultaneously learning the latent factors and the sparse
causal graphical model that relates them. We develop a rigorous identifiability
theory, building on recent nonlinear independent component analysis (ICA)
results, that formalizes this principle and shows how the latent variables can
be recovered up to permutation if one regularizes the latent mechanisms to be
sparse and if some graph connectivity criterion is satisfied by the data
generating process. As a special case of our framework, we show how one can
leverage unknown-target interventions on the latent factors to disentangle
them, thereby drawing further connections between ICA and causality. We propose
a VAE-based method in which the latent mechanisms are learned and regularized

to be nonstable, if one can find a man, a woman, and a dog, which belong to
different triples and prefer each other to their current partners in the

throughout. A local vertex-model reformulation is exhibited, analogous to the

geometrical content of the webs and their U_q(sl_3) symmetry, and permits us to
study the model on a cylinder via a local transfer matrix. A numerical study of
the central charge reveals that for each q $\in \mathbb{C}$ in the critical
regime, |q|=1, the web model possesses a dense and a dilute critical point,
just like its loop model counterpart. In the dense $q=-e^{i \pi/4}$ case, the
n=3 webs can be identified with spin interfaces of the critical three-state
Potts model defined on the triangular lattice dual to H. We also provide
another mapping to a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin model on H itself, using a
high-temperature expansion. We then discuss the sector structure of the

finite-size precursors of electromagnetic operators. This discussion paves the
road for a Coulomb gas description of the conformal properties of defect webs,

multi-host contact networks to elucidate the potential of disease spread among
farms with multiple species. Four years of between-farm animal movement data of
bovine, swine, small ruminants, and multi-host, were described through both
static and time-series networks; the in-going and out-going contact chains were
also calculated. We use the proposed stochastic multilevel model to simulate
scenarios in which infection was seeded into a single host and multi-hosts
farms, to estimate epidemic trajectories and simulate network-based control
actions to assess the reduction of secondarily infected farms. Our analysis
showed that the swine network was more connected than cattle and small
ruminants in the temporal network view. The small ruminants network was shown
disconnected, however, allowing the interaction among networks with different
hosts enabling the spread of disease throughout the network. Independently from
the initial infected host, secondary infections were observed crossing overall
species. We showed that targeting the top 3.25% of the farms ranked by degree
could reduce the total number of infected farms below 70% at the end of the
simulation period. In conclusion, we demonstrated the potential of the
multi-host network in disease propagation, therefore, it becomes important to

model is a time-varying coefficient compartment model to recapitulate the
dynamics among susceptible, exposed, undetected infectious, detected
infectious, undetected removed, detected non-infectious, detected recovered,
and detected deceased individuals. The infectiousness and detection parameters
are modeled to vary by time, and the infectiousness component in the model
incorporates information on multiple sources of population mobility. Along with
this compartment model, a multiplicative process model is introduced to allow
for deviation from the deterministic dynamics. We apply this model to observed
COVID-19 cases and deaths in several US states and Colorado counties. We find
that population mobility measures are highly correlated with transmission rates
and can explain complicated temporal variation in infectiousness in these
regions. Additionally, the inferred connections between mobility and
epidemiological parameters, varying across locations, have revealed the
heterogeneous effects of different policies on the dynamics of COVID-19.

aggregating information from crowd. How can the decision maker incentivize the
crowds to report their information truthfully? Many truthful peer prediction
mechanisms have been proposed for homogeneous agents, whose types are drawn
from the same distribution. However, in many situations, the population is a
hybrid crowd of different types of agents with different forms of information,
and the decision maker has neither the identity of any individual nor the
proportion of each types of agents in the crowd. Ignoring the heterogeneity
among the agent may lead to inefficient of biased information, which would in
turn lead to suboptimal decisions. In this paper, we propose the first
framework for information elicitation from hybrid crowds, and two mechanisms to
motivate agents to report their information truthfully. The first mechanism
combines two mechanisms via linear transformations and the second is based on
mutual information. With two mechanisms, the decision maker can collect high
quality information from hybrid crowds, and learns the expertise of agents.

control scheme which for the first time provides online/offline encryption,
hidden access policy, and access policy update simultaneously. In our scheme,
resource-constrained devices are equipped with online/offline encryption
reducing the encryption overhead significantly. Furthermore, attributes of
access policies are hidden such that the attribute sets satisfying an access
policy cannot be guessed by other parties. Moreover, data owners can update
their defined access policies while outsourcing a major part of the updating
process to the cloud service provider. In particular, we introduce blind access
policies that enable the cloud service provider to update the data owners'
access policies without receiving a new re-encryption key. Besides, our scheme
supports fast decryption such that the decryption algorithm consists of a
constant number of bilinear pairing operations. The proposed scheme is proven
to be secure in the random oracle model and under the hardness of Decisional

Also, performance analysis results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is

high-noise data has negative effects not just on data accuracy and network
reliability, but also regarding the decision-making processes in the base

privacy of sensitive data, oweing to its robust mathematical guarantees and
general applicability to a vast array of computations on data, including
statistical analysis and machine learning. Previous work demonstrated that
concrete implementations of differential privacy mechanisms are vulnerable to
statistical attacks. This vulnerability is caused by the approximation of real
values to floating point numbers. This paper presents a practical solution to
the finite-precision floating point vulnerability, where the inverse transform
sampling of the Laplace distribution can itself be inverted, thus enabling an
attack where the original value can be retrieved with non-negligible advantage.
The proposed solution has the advantages of being generalisable to any
infinitely divisible probability distribution, and of simple implementation in
modern architectures. Finally, the solution has been designed to make side
channel attack infeasible, because of inherently exponential, in the size of
the domain, brute force attacks.

one-dimensional quantum and classical crystals, also named Zak's phase, when
computed with a Fourier basis. We show that Zak's phase can be divided in two
terms: a global phase required to make the Bloch wave periodic in the Brillouin
zone and an internal phase which measures the relative delay of the different
Fourier terms within the Brillouin zone. While the former phase is dependent on
the origin of coordinates of the unit cell, the latter is independent of it, so
that it can be interpreted as an internal property of the band itself. We show
that this internal phase is always zero for a symmetric crystal while it can
take any value when this symmetry is broken, showing therefore that it can be
interpreted as a measure of the assymetry of the band. Since for a symmetric
crystal Zak's phase is entirely determined by the global part, we show that
this can be easily calculated by means of the parity of the Fourier terms at
the center and edge of the Brillouin zone, being therefore unnecessary the
integration of the modes through the unit cell and the entire Brillouin zone.
We provide numerical examples analyzing the internal part for both electronic
and classical waves (acoustic or photonic). We analyze the weakest electronic
potential capable of presenting asymmetry, as well as the double-Dirac delta
potential, and in both examples it is found that the internal phase varies
continuously as a function of a symmetry-control parameter, but it is zero when
the crystal is symmetric. For classical waves, the layered material is
analyzed. Although Zak's phase has been mainly studied in connection with the
existence of edge states in finite crystals, we consider that the study of the
internal phase can be more relevant to understand bulk properties of quantum
and classical crystals.

management in urban areas. In recent years, traffic control methods based on
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have gained attention due to their ability to
exploit real-time traffic data, which is often poorly used by the traditional
hand-crafted methods. While most recent DRL-based methods have focused on
maximizing the throughput or minimizing the average travel time of the
vehicles, the fairness of the traffic signal controllers has often been
neglected. This is particularly important as neglecting fairness can lead to
situations where some vehicles experience extreme waiting times, or where the
throughput of a particular traffic flow is highly impacted by the fluctuations
of another conflicting flow at the intersection. In order to address these
issues, we introduce two notions of fairness: delay-based and throughput-based
fairness, which correspond to the two issues mentioned above. Furthermore, we
propose two DRL-based traffic signal control methods for implementing these
fairness notions, that can achieve a high throughput as well. We evaluate the
performance of our proposed methods using three traffic arrival distributions,
and find that our methods outperform the baselines in the tested scenarios.

on a technique known from integrated circuit (IC) failure analysis, capable of

measure, since it has been shown to correlate strongly with basic audio quality
in source separation. An alternative operation mode of the measure is proposed,
more appropriate when considering material with long inactive periods of the
target source. The 2f-model requires the reference target source as an input,
but this is not available in many applications. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are
trained to estimate the 2f-model intrusively using the reference target
(iDNN2f), non-intrusively using the input mix as reference (nDNN2f), and
reference-free using only the separated output signal (rDNN2f). It is shown
that iDNN2f achieves very strong correlation with the original measure on the
test data (Pearson r=0.99), while performance decreases for nDNN2f (r>=0.91)

(FR) discretization, including the influence of polynomial order and
penalization parameter on numerical errors and stability. Through a
semi-discrete analysis, we find that the inclusion of IBM adds additional
dissipation without changing significantly the dispersion of the original
numerical discretization. This agrees with the physical intuition that in this
type of approach, the solid wall is modelled as a porous medium with vanishing
viscosity. From a stability point view, the selection of penalty parameter can
be analyzed based on a fully-discrete analysis, which leads to practical
guidelines on the selection of penalization parameter. Numerical experiments
indicate that the penalization term needs to be increased to damp oscillations
inside the solid (i.e. porous region), which leads to undesirable time step
restrictions. As an alternative, we propose to include a second-order term in
the solid for the no-slip wall boundary condition. Results show that by adding
a second-order term we improve the overall accuracy with relaxed time step
restriction. This indicates that the optimal value of the penalization
parameter and the second-order damping can be carefully chosen to obtain a more

to tilting of the N\'eel order l. The torque on the magnetization becomes
stronger due to coupling with the induced Oersted field or the field-like

minimal seeds for the formation of turbulent bands in channel flow. Using
nonlinear optimization together with energy bisection, we have found that the
minimal energy threshold for obtaining spatially-patterned turbulence scales
with $Re^{-8.5}$ for $Re>1000$. The minimal seed is constituted by a localized
spot-like structure surrounded by a low-amplitude large-scale quadrupolar
structure filling the whole domain. This minimal-energy perturbation of the
laminar flow has dominant wavenumbers equal to $0.15$ and $4$ in the streamwise
and spanwise directions, respectively, and is characterized by a more marked
spatial localization when the Reynolds number increases. At $Re \lesssim 1200$,
the minimal seed evolves in time creating an isolated oblique band. Whereas,
for $Re\gtrsim 1200$, an almost spanwise-symmetric evolution is observed,
giving rise to two distinct bands. A similar evolution is found also at low
$Re$ for non-minimal optimal perturbations. This highlights two different
mechanisms of formation of turbulent bands in channel flow, depending on the
Reynolds number and initial energy of the perturbation. The selection of one of
these two mechanisms appears to be affected by the probability of decay of the
newly-created stripe, which increases with time, but decreases with the
Reynolds number.

from training data, which requires a model to both recognize the known actions

challenging to be recognized in an open-set setting due to the uncertain
temporal dynamics and static bias of human actions. In this paper, we propose a
Deep Evidential Action Recognition (DEAR) method to recognize actions in an
open testing set. Specifically, we formulate the action recognition problem
from the evidential deep learning (EDL) perspective and propose a novel model
calibration method to regularize the EDL training. Besides, to mitigate the

debias the learned representation through contrastive learning. Experimental

This work studies the automated refactoring of legacy ES5 code to ES6 modules

modules through destructuring exported module objects to fine-grained module

A prototype implementation has been empirically evaluated on 19 open source

intent for fine-grained reuse. The analysis of refactored code shows an
increase in the number of reusable elements per project and reduction in the
coupling of refactored modules. The soundness of the refactoring is empirically
validated through code inspection and execution of projects' test suites.

natural microorganisms. Many of these creatures exploit the fact that
elasticity breaks the time-reversal symmetry of motion at low Reynolds numbers,
but this principle has been notably absent from model systems of active,
self-propelled microswimmers. Here we introduce a class of microswimmer that
spontaneously self-assembles and swims without using external forces, driven
instead by surface phase transitions induced by temperature variations. The
swimmers are made from alkane droplets dispersed in aqueous surfactant
solution, which start to self-propel upon cooling, pushed by rapidly growing
thin elastic tails. When heated, the same droplets recharge by retracting their
tails, swimming for up to tens of minutes in each cycle. Thermal oscillations
of approximately 5 degrees Celsius induce the swimmers to harness heat from the
environment and recharge multiple times. We develop a detailed
elastohydrodynamic model of these processes and highlight the molecular
mechanisms involved. The system offers a convenient platform for examining
symmetry breaking in the motion of swimmers exploiting flagellar elasticity.
The mild conditions and biocompatible media render these microswimmers
potential probes for studying biological propulsion and interactions between
artificial and biological swimmers.

  Magnetic modular cubes are cubes with magnets arranged on their faces. The
magnets are positioned so that each face has either magnetic south or north
pole outward. Moreover, we require that the net magnetic moment of the cube
passes through the center of opposing faces. These magnetic arrangements enable
coupling when cube faces with opposite polarity are brought in close proximity
and enable moving the cubes by controlling the orientation of a global magnetic
field. This paper investigates the 2D and 3D shapes that can be constructed by
magnetic modular cubes, and describes all possible magnet arrangements that
obey these rules. We select ten magnetic arrangements and assign a ""colo""' to

built by leveraging reusable code in the form of libraries and packages.
Software ecosystems (e.g., npm) are the primary enablers of this code reuse,
providing developers with a platform to share their own and use others' code.
These ecosystems evolve rapidly: developers add new packages every day to solve
new problems or provide alternative solutions, causing obsolete packages to
decline in their importance to the community. Developers should avoid depending
on packages in decline, as these packages are reused less over time and may
become less frequently maintained. However, current popularity metrics (e.g.,
Stars, and Downloads) are not fit to provide this information to developers
because their semantics do not aptly capture shifts in the community interest.
  In this paper, we propose a scalable approach that uses the package's
centrality in the ecosystem to identify packages in decline. We evaluate our
approach with the npm ecosystem and show that the trends of centrality over
time can correctly distinguish packages in decline with an ROC-AUC of 0.9. The
approach can capture 87% of the packages in decline, on average 18 months
before the trend is shown in currently used package popularity metrics. We
implement this approach in a tool that can be used to augment the npms metrics

attempt to influence the brain's large-scale, dynamic network state transitions
underlying cognition and behavior. Building on connectome-based graph analysis
and control theory, Network Control Theory is emerging as a powerful tool to
quantify network controllability - i.e., the influence of one brain region over
others regarding dynamic network state transitions. If and how network
controllability is related to mental health remains elusive.
  Methods: From Diffusion Tensor Imaging data, we inferred structural
connectivity and inferred calculated network controllability parameters to
investigate their association with genetic and familial risk in patients
diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD, n=692) and healthy controls
(n=820).
  Results: First, we establish that controllability measures differ between
healthy controls and MDD patients while not varying with current symptom
severity or remission status. Second, we show that controllability in MDD
patients is associated with polygenic scores for MDD and psychiatric
cross-disorder risk. Finally, we provide evidence that controllability varies
with familial risk of MDD and bipolar disorder as well as with body mass index.
  Conclusions: We show that network controllability is related to genetic,
individual, and familial risk in MDD patients. We discuss how these insights
into individual variation of network controllability may inform mechanistic
models of treatment response prediction and personalized intervention-design in
mental health.

for samples of more massive (O-type) binaries in both the LMC and the Galaxy.
This similarity with the properties of the more massive O-type binaries is
important as early B-type stars are expected to account for the majority of

unfairness appeals to the idea that fair decisions are not arbitrary: they
should not be based on the chance event of any one person's inclusion in the

stability, but it focuses on the consistency of an individual point's
prediction outcome over unit changes to the training data, rather than the
error of the model in aggregate. Beyond formalizing leave-one-out unfairness,
we characterize the extent to which deep models behave leave-one-out unfairly
on real data, including in cases where the generalization error is small.
Further, we demonstrate that adversarial training and randomized smoothing
techniques have opposite effects on leave-one-out fairness, which sheds light
on the relationships between robustness, memorization, individual fairness, and

processing and analysis of multimodal neuroimaging data (currently, T1-weighted

learning and deep learning. It relies on the brain imaging data structure
(BIDS) for the organization of raw neuroimaging datasets and on established
tools written by the community to build its pipelines. It also provides
converters of public neuroimaging datasets to BIDS (currently ADNI, AIBL, OASIS
and NIFD). Processed data include image-valued scalar fields (e.g. tissue
probability maps), meshes, surface-based scalar fields (e.g. cortical thickness
maps) or scalar outputs (e.g. regional averages). These data follow the ClinicA
Processed Structure (CAPS) format which shares the same philosophy as BIDS.
Consistent organization of raw and processed neuroimaging files facilitates the
execution of single pipelines and of sequences of pipelines, as well as the
integration of processed data into statistics or machine learning frameworks.
The target audience of Clinica is neuroscientists or clinicians conducting

ensembling to federated learning (FL). Instead of aggregating localmodels to
update a single global model, Fed-ensemble uses random permutations to update a
group of K models and then obtains predictions through model averaging.
Fed-ensemble can be readily utilized within established FL methods and does not
impose a computational overhead as it only requires one of the K models to be
sent to a client in each communication round. Theoretically, we show that
predictions on newdata from all K models belong to the same predictive
posterior distribution under a neural tangent kernel regime. This result in
turn sheds light onthe generalization advantages of model averaging. We also
illustrate thatFed-ensemble has an elegant Bayesian interpretation. Empirical
results show that our model has superior performance over several FL

performs high definition volumetric imaging in all projections, enabling
reconstruction of anatomical details of the retinal and choroidal layers with
unprecedented quality by using an extra phase randomization for low spatial
coherence. We also demonstrate that STOC-T can detect blood flow and reveal
vascular networks in various chorioretinal layers that are otherwise invisible
to OCT. This capability highlights the unique value of STOC-T angiography.
These technical advances enable acquisition of detailed choroidal structures,

Further, the radical pairs in cryptochrome also can explain magnetoreception in

dynamics of the naturally occurring radical pairs and hence modulate the
circadian clock's rhythms. Using a simple chemical oscillator model for the
circadian clock, we show that the spin dynamics influence a rate in the
chemical oscillator model, which translates into a change in the circadian
period. Our model can reproduce the results of two independent experiments,
magnetic fields and lithium effects on the circadian clock. Our model predicts
that stronger magnetic fields would shorten the clock's period. We also predict
that lithium influences the clock in an isotope-dependent manner. Furthermore,
our model also predicts that magnetic fields and hyperfine interactions
modulate oxidative stress. The findings of this work suggest that quantum

upper limit for high-mass starless cores of $X_{\rm CH_3CN}<4.0\times10^{-11}$,
and a range in abundance of $4.0\times10^{-11}<X_{\rm

ignoring their explanation. Nonetheless, providing pieces of evidence to
explain why a suspicious tweet is rumor is essential. As such, a novel model,
LOSIRD, was proposed in this paper. First, LOSIRD mines appropriate evidence
sentences and classifies them by automatically checking the veracity of the
relationship of the given claim and its evidence from about 5 million Wikipedia
documents. LOSIRD then automatically constructs two heterogeneous graph objects
to simulate the propagation layout of the tweets and code the relationship of
evidence. Finally, a graphSAGE processing component is used in LOSIRD to
provide the label and evidence. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first
one who combines objective facts and subjective views to verify rumor. The
experimental results on two real-world Twitter datasets showed that our model
exhibited the best performance in the early rumor detection task and its rumor
detection performance outperformed other baseline and state-of-the-art models.
Moreover, we confirmed that both objective information and subjective
information are fundamental clues for rumor detection.

  terminology, and clarifies proofs",,,,"cs.HC cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The efficiency of modern computer graphics allows us to explore collections
of space curves simultaneously with ""drag-to-rotate"" interfaces. This inspires
us to replace ""scatterplots of points"" with ""scatterplots of curves"" to
simultaneously visualize relationships across an entire dataset. Since spaces
of curves are infinite dimensional, scatterplots of curves avoid the ""lossy""
nature of scatterplots of points. In particular, if two points are close in a
scatterplot of points derived from high-dimensional data, it does not generally
follow that the two associated data points are close in the data space.
Standard Andrews plots provide scatterplots of curves that perfectly preserve
Euclidean distances, but simultaneous visualization of these graphs over an
entire dataset produces visual clutter because graphs of functions generally
overlap in 2D. We mitigate this visual clutter issue by constructing
computationally inexpensive 3D extensions of Andrews plots. First, we construct
optimally smooth 3D Andrews plots by considering linear isometries from
Euclidean data spaces to spaces of planar parametric curves. We rigorously
parametrize the linear isometries that produce (on average) optimally smooth
curves over a given dataset. This parameterization of optimal isometries
reveals many degrees of freedom, and (using recent results on generalized Gauss
sums) we identify a particular member of this set which admits an asymptotic
""tour"" property that avoids certain local degeneracies as well. Finally, we
construct unit-length 3D curves (filaments) by numerically solving
Frenet-Serret systems given data from these 3D Andrews plots. We conclude with
examples of filament plots for several standard datasets, illustrating how
filament plots avoid visual clutter. Code and examples available at

in 2014, neutron stars have been considered as their central objects. However,
it remains unclear how neutron stars can be brighter than the Eddington
luminosity, and no unified view exists on the magnetic field of neutron stars
and the degree of beaming. Recent observations suggest that some X-ray
pulsating ULXs have Be-type donors, and some of them occupy the same region as
Be-type high-mass X-ray binaries (Be-HMXBs) on the Corbet diagram, which
reveals the relation between spin and orbital periods. This suggests that at
least some ULXs are special cases of Be-HMXBs. In this study, we use the
framework of mass-accretion models for Be-HMXBs to investigate the conditions
under which neutron stars achieve mass-accretion rates beyond the Eddington
limit and become observable as ULXs. We show that a Be-HMXB may become a ULX if
the magnetic field of the neutron star and the density of the Be disc meet
certain conditions. We also show that, although a stronger magnetic field
increases the brightness of a neutron star ULX with a Be donor, its brightness
cannot exceed the Eddington limit by a more than a factor of ${\approx} 50$.
Finally, we propose a scenario whereby some normal Be-HMXBs may evolve into
ULXs as the donor evolves into a giant.

their radio flux detectability. If the jet power $P_{\rm jet}\gtrsim10^{42-43}$
erg s$^{-1}$, it can be detectable by SKA/ngVLA, depending on the jet
inclination angle. Considering the relation between jet power and black hole
mass and spin, generally, jetted DCBHs with mass $\gtrsim10^5~M_\odot$ can be
detected. For a total jetted DCBH number density of $\sim2.5\times10^{-3}$
Mpc$^{-3}$ at $z=10$, about 100 deg$^{-2}z^{-1}$ DCBHs are expected to be above
the detection threshold of SKA1-mid (100 hours integration). If the jet ""blob""
emitting most of the radio signal is dense and highly relativistic, then the
DCBH would only feebly emit in the SKA-low band, because of self-synchrotron
absorption (SSA) and blueshift. Moreover, the free-free absorption in the DCBH
envelope may further reduce the signal in the SKA-low band. Thus, combining
SKA-low and SKA-mid observations might provide a potential tool to distinguish

We employ 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract spatio-temporal
representations from video clips. To solve the temporal scale discrepancies
between the query and the target videos, we construct multiple queries from a
single video clip using different frame-level strides. Self-attention is
applied across these query clips to simulate a continuous scale space. We also
utilize another self-attention module on the target video to learn the
contextual within the sequence. Finally a mutual-attention is used to match the
temporal scales to localize the query within the target sequence. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can not only reliably
identify isolated signs in continuous videos, regardless of the signers'
appearance, but can also generalize to different sign languages. By taking
advantage of the attention mechanism and the adaptive features, our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the sign spotting task with accuracy

the frequency hopping system, in order to fully extract effective features of
the interferences from the received signals, the linear and bilinear transform
based composite time-frequency analysis method is adopted. Then the
time-frequency spectrograms obtained from the time-frequency analysis are
constructed as matching pairs and input to the deep neural network for
classification. In particular, the Siamese neural network is used as the
classifier, where the paired spectrograms are input into the two sub-networks
of the deep networks, and these two sub-networks extract the features of the
paired spectrograms for interference type classification. The simulation
results confirm that the proposed algorithm can obtain higher classification
accuracy than both traditional single time-frequency representation based
approach and the AlexNet transfer learning or convolutional neural network
based methods.
