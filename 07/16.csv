  Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction""",,,,"physics.ed-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  University buildings are significant closed built environments for COVID-19
spreading. As universities prepare to re-start in-class activities, students'
adherence to physical distancing requirements is a priority topic. While
physical distancing in classrooms can be easily managed, the movement of
students inside common spaces can pose higher risks due to individuals'
proximity. This paper provides an experimental analysis of unidirectional
student flow inside a case-study university building, by investigating
students' movements and grouping behaviour according to physical distancing
requirements. Results show general adherence with the minimum required physical
distancing guidance, but some spaces, such as corridors, pose higher exposure
than doorways. Their width, in combination with group behaviour, affects the
students' capacity to keep the recommended distance. Furthermore, students
report higher perceived vulnerability while moving along corridors.
Evidence-based results can support decision-makers in understanding
individuals' exposure in universities and researchers in developing behavioural
models in preparation of future outbreaks and pandemics.

Consider a principal who wants to collect an agent's prediction about an
unknown state. The agent can either report his prior prediction or access a
costly signal and report the posterior prediction. Given a collection of
possible distributions containing the agent's posterior prediction
distribution, the principal's objective is to design a bounded scoring rule to
maximize the agent's worst-case payoff increment between reporting his
posterior prediction and reporting his prior prediction.
  We study two settings of such optimization for proper scoring rules: static
and asymptotic settings. In the static setting, where the agent can access one
signal, we propose an efficient algorithm to compute an optimal scoring rule
when the collection of distributions is finite. The agent can adaptively and
indefinitely refine his prediction in the asymptotic setting. We first consider
a sequence of collections of posterior distributions with vanishing covariance,
which emulates general estimators with large samples, and show the optimality
of the quadratic scoring rule. Then, when the agent's posterior distribution is
a Beta-Bernoulli process, we find that the log scoring rule is optimal. We also
prove the optimality of the log scoring rule over a smaller set of functions
for categorical distributions with Dirichlet priors.

interaction has recently been the subject of intense research. Demanding the
absence of causality violation in high energy graviton scattering processes has
led to a hierarchy of constraints on higher derivative terms in the Lagrangian.
Most of these constraints have relied on analysis that is performed in general
relativistic backgrounds, as opposed to a generic solution to the equations of
motion which are perturbed by higher curvature operators. Hence, these
constraints are necessary but may not be sufficient to ensure that the theory
is consistent. In this context, we explore the so-called CEMZ causality
constraints on Quadratic Gravity in a space of shock wave solutions beyond GR.
We show that the Shapiro time delay experienced by a graviton is
polarization-independent and positive, regardless of the strength of the
gravitational couplings. Our analysis shows that as far as the causality
constraints are concerned, albeit inequivalent to General Relativity due to
additional propagating modes, Quadratic Gravity is causal as per as the
diagnostic proposed by CEMZ.

of the cover as a $G$-representation. The main contribution of this article is
to broaden the correspondence and dictionary between the representation theory
of the deck group $G$ on the one hand, and topological properties of homology
classes in $H_1(Y;\mathbb{C})$ on the other hand. We do so by studying certain
subrepresentations in the $G$-representation $H_1(Y;\mathbb{C})$.
  The homology class of a lift of a primitive element in $\pi_1(X)$ spans an
induced subrepresentation in $H_1(Y;\mathbb{C})$, and we show that this
property is never sufficient to characterize such homology classes if $G$ is
Abelian. We study $H_1^{\textrm{comm}}(Y;\mathbb{C}) \leq H_1(Y;\mathbb{C})$ --
the subrepresentation spanned by homology classes of lifts of commutators of
primitive elements in $\pi_1(X)$. Concretely, we prove that the span of such a
homology class is isomorphic to the quotient of two induced representations.
Furthermore, we construct examples of finite covers with
$H_1^{\textrm{comm}}(Y;\mathbb{C}) \neq \ker(p_*)$.

which imply abundances relative to CO that are orders of magnitude lower than
those observed in protoplanetary disks and Solar System comets, and also those
predicted in outgassing models of second-generation material. However, if CI
shielding is responsible for extending the lifetime of any CO produced in
second-generation collisions, as proposed by Kral et al. (2018), then the line
ratios do not reflect true ice phase chemical abundances, but rather imply that
CO is shielded by its own photodissociation product, CI, but other molecules
are rapidly photodissociated by the stellar and interstellar radiation field.

the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation for both the non-extremal case

consistent with the unitarity principle: at early times the entanglement
entropy grows linearly in time without the island and at late times it is
saturated double of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy in the presence of the
island. We observe the Page time is universal for all different models studied
by our method: $t_{\text{Page}}=\frac{3}{ \pi c}\frac{S_{\text{BH}}}{T_H}.$ For
the extremal case, the island prescription provides the well defined
entanglement entropy only with the island, which can not be obtained from the
continuous limit of the non-extremal case. This implies that the Page curve may
not be reproduced for the extremal case and further investigation is needed.

recently achieved promising performance in various natural language processing

purely stacking the manually designed global self-attention layers, introducing
inductive bias and thus leads to sub-optimal. In this work, we make the first
attempt to automatically discover novel pre-trained language model (PLM)
backbone on a flexible search space containing the most fundamental operations
from scratch. Specifically, we propose a well-designed search space which (i)
contains primitive math operations in the intra-layer level to explore novel
attention structures, and (ii) leverages convolution blocks to be the
supplementary for attentions in the inter-layer level to better learn local
dependency. To enhance the efficiency for finding promising architectures, we
propose an Operation-Priority Neural Architecture Search (OP-NAS) algorithm,
which optimizes both the search algorithm and evaluation of candidate models.
Specifically, we propose Operation-Priority (OP) evolution strategy to
facilitate model search via balancing exploration and exploitation.
Furthermore, we design a Bi-branch Weight-Sharing (BIWS) training strategy for
fast model evaluation. Extensive experiments show that the searched
architecture (named AutoBERT-Zero) significantly outperforms BERT and its
variants of different model capacities in various downstream tasks, proving the
architecture's transfer and scaling abilities. Remarkably, AutoBERT-Zero-base
outperforms RoBERTa-base (using much more data) and BERT-large (with much
larger model size) by 2.4 and 1.4 higher score on GLUE test set.

the universe. Typically, dust around AGB stars is investigated via radiative
transfer (RT) modeling, or via simple deconstruction of observed spectra.
However, methodologies applied vary. Using archival spectroscopic, photometric,
and temporal data for the archetypal dusty star, Mira, we identify its
circumstellar silicate dust grains. This is achieved by matching the positions
and widths of observed spectral features with laboratory data. To do this
comparison properly, it is necessary to account for the continuum emission.
Here we investigate various ways in which a continuum is eliminated from
observational spectra and how it affects the interpretation of spectral
features. We find that while the precise continuum shapes and temperatures do
not have a critical impact on the positions and shapes of dust spectral
features, it is important to eliminate continua in a specific way. It is
important to understand what contributes to the spectrum in order to remove the
continuum in a way that allows comparison with laboratory spectra of candidate
dust species. Our methodologies are applicable to optically thin systems, like
that of Mira. Higher optical depths will require RT modeling, which cannot
include many different potential astrominerals because there is a lack of
complex refractive indices. Finally, we found that the classic silicate feature
exhibited by Mira is not consistent with a real amorphous silicate alone but
may be best explained with a small alumina contribution to match the observed
FWHM of the 10 micron feature.

capable of generating antipodal robotic grasps on seen as well as unseen

grasp pose accuracy for detecting both regular and irregular shaped objects

trainable parameters as compared to the existing approaches. However, to attain
this level of performance the model requires the entire 90% of the available

vulnerable to poor generalization. Furthermore, getting sufficient and quality
labelled dataset is becoming increasingly difficult keeping in pace with the
requirement of gigantic networks. To address these issues, we attach our model
as a decoder with a semi-supervised learning based architecture known as Vector
Quantized Variational Auto Encoder (VQVAE), which works efficiently when

session-based recommender systems (SBRSs), which aim to model the dynamic
preferences of users for next-item recommendations. However, most of the
existing studies on SBRSs are based on long sessions only for recommendations,
ignoring short sessions, though short sessions, in fact, account for a large
proportion in most of the real-world datasets. As a result, the applicability
of existing SBRSs solutions is greatly reduced. In a short session, quite
limited contextual information is available, making the next-item
recommendation very challenging. To this end, in this paper, inspired by the
success of few-shot learning (FSL) in effectively learning a model with limited
instances, we formulate the next-item recommendation as an FSL problem.
Accordingly, following the basic idea of a representative approach for FSL,
i.e., meta-learning, we devise an effective SBRS called INter-SEssion
collaborative Recommender netTwork (INSERT) for next-item recommendations in
short sessions. With the carefully devised local module and global module,
INSERT is able to learn an optimal preference representation of the current
user in a given short session. In particular, in the global module, a similar
session retrieval network (SSRN) is designed to find out the sessions similar
to the current short session from the historical sessions of both the current
user and other users, respectively. The obtained similar sessions are then
utilized to complement and optimize the preference representation learned from
the current short session by the local module for more accurate next-item
recommendations in this short session. Extensive experiments conducted on two
real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed INSERT over the
state-of-the-art SBRSs when making next-item recommendations in short sessions.

essential elements of this framework are Koopman Eigenfunction (KEF), for which
existence conditions are formulated. This is done by viewing the dynamic as a

We demonstrate applications of this analysis, such as finding KEFs and their
multiplicities, dynamics reconstruction, and global linearization.

systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), it is often required to
select the most efficient method for a particular problem. To solve a Cauchy
problem for a system of ODEs, Runge-Kutta methods (explicit or implicit ones,
with or without step-size control, etc.) are employed. In that case, it is
required to search through many implementations of the numerical method and
select coefficients or other parameters of its numerical scheme. This paper
proposes a library and scripts for automated generation of routine functions in
the Julia programming language for a set of numerical schemes of Runge-Kutta
methods. For symbolic manipulations, we use a template substitution tool. The
proposed approach to automated generation of program code allows us to use a
single template for editing, instead of modifying each individual function to
be compared. On the one hand, this provides universality in the implementation
of a numerical scheme and, on the other hand, makes it possible to minimize the
number of errors in the process of modifying the compared implementations of
the numerical method. We consider Runge-Kutta methods without step-size
control, embedded methods with step-size control, and Rosenbrock methods with
step-size control. The program codes for the numerical schemes, which are
generated automatically using the proposed library, are tested by numerical
solution of several well-known problems.

The existing state-of-the-art method uses multi-task branches to predict the
amodal part and the visible part separately and subtract the visible part from
the amodal part to obtain the occluded part. However, the amodal part contains
visible information. Therefore, the separated prediction method will generate
duplicate information. Different from this method, we propose a method of
amodal segmentation based on the idea of the jigsaw. The method uses multi-task
branches to predict the two naturally decoupled parts of visible and occluded,
which is like getting two matching jigsaw pieces. Then put the two jigsaw
pieces together to get the amodal part. This makes each branch focus on the
modeling of the object. And we believe that there are certain rules in the
occlusion relationship in the real world. This is a kind of occlusion context
information. This jigsaw method can better model the occlusion relationship and
use the occlusion context information, which is important for amodal
segmentation. Experiments on two widely used amodally annotated datasets prove
that our method exceeds existing state-of-the-art methods. The source code of

distances compared to their counterparts, single-edge protographs. However,
considering different features of their Tanner graph, such as short cycles,
girth and other graphical structures, is harder than for Tanner graphs from
single-edge protographs. In this paper, we provide a novel approach to
construct the parity-check matrix of an LDPC code which is based on trades
obtained from block designs. We employ our method to construct two important
categories of LDPC codes; quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC and spatially-coupled LDPC
(SC-LDPC) codes.
  We use those trade-based matrices to define base matrices of multiple-edge
protographs. The construction of exponent matrices corresponding to these base
matrices has less complexity compared to the ones proposed in the literature.
We prove that these base matrices result in QC-LDPC codes with smaller lower
bounds on the lifting degree than existing ones.
  There are three categories of SC-LDPC codes: periodic, time-invariant and
time-varying. Constructing the parity-check matrix of the third one is more
difficult because of the time dependency in the parity-check matrix. We use a
trade-based matrix to obtain the parity-check matrix of a time-varying SC-LDPC
code in which each downwards row displacement of the trade-based matrix yields
syndrome matrices of a particular time. Combining the different row shifts the
whole parity-check matrix is obtained.
  Our proposed method to construct parity-check and base matrices from trade
designs is applicable to any type of super-simple directed block designs. We
apply our technique to directed designs with smallest defining sets containing
at least half of the blocks. To demonstrate the significance of our
contribution, we provide a number of numerical and simulation results.

perception. The recently introduced deep noise suppression mean opinion score
(DNSMOS) metric was shown to estimate human ratings with great accuracy. The
signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) metric is widely used to evaluate
residual-echo suppression (RES) systems by estimating speech quality during
double-talk. However, since the SDR is affected by both speech distortion and
residual-echo presence, it does not correlate well with human ratings according
to the DNSMOS. To address that, we introduce two objective metrics to
separately quantify the desired-speech maintained level (DSML) and
residual-echo suppression level (RESL) during double-talk. These metrics are
evaluated using a deep learning-based RES-system with a tunable design
parameter. Using 280 hours of real and simulated recordings, we show that the
DSML and RESL correlate well with the DNSMOS with high generalization to
various setups. Also, we empirically investigate the relation between tuning
the RES-system design parameter and the DSML-RESL tradeoff it creates and offer
a practical design scheme for dynamic system requirements.

anamorphosis (GA) methods and two-step updates, of which the rank histogram
filter (RHF) is a prototypical example. GA-EnKF methods apply univariate
transforms to the state and observation variables to make their distribution
more Gaussian before applying an EnKF. The two-step methods use a scalar

second step. The connection of the two-step framework to the full Bayesian
problem is made, which opens the door to more advanced two-step methods in the

deals with the orbital nature of magneto-electric effects in conventional

supercurrent-induced orbital magnetization is more than one order of magnitude

sign change occurring for the Fermi level lying in proximity of avoiding
crossing points in the Brillouin zone and in the presence of superconducting
phase inhomogeneities, yielding domains with opposite orbital moment
orientation. The orbital-dominated magneto-electric phenomena, hence, have
clear-cut marks for detection both in the bulk and at the edge of the system

sketching has emerged as a powerful technique for constructing estimates of the
Hessian which can be used to perform approximate Newton steps. This involves
multiplication by a random sketching matrix, which introduces a trade-off
between the computational cost of sketching and the convergence rate of the
optimization algorithm. A theoretically desirable but practically much too
expensive choice is to use a dense Gaussian sketching matrix, which produces
unbiased estimates of the exact Newton step and which offers strong
problem-independent convergence guarantees. We show that the Gaussian sketching
matrix can be drastically sparsified, significantly reducing the computational
cost of sketching, without substantially affecting its convergence properties.
This approach, called Newton-LESS, is based on a recently introduced sketching
technique: LEverage Score Sparsified (LESS) embeddings. We prove that
Newton-LESS enjoys nearly the same problem-independent local convergence rate
as Gaussian embeddings, not just up to constant factors but even down to lower
order terms, for a large class of optimization tasks. In particular, this leads
to a new state-of-the-art convergence result for an iterative least squares

  Six and Seven","Accepted to PSJ",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present diameters and albedos computed for the near-Earth and Main Belt
asteroids observed by the Near-Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer
(NEOWISE) spacecraft during the sixth and seventh years of its Reactivation
mission. These diameters and albedos are calculated from fitting thermal models
to NEOWISE observations of $199$ NEOs and $5851$ MBAs detected during the sixth
year of the survey, and $175$ NEOs and $5861$ MBAs from the seventh year.
Comparisons of the near-Earth object diameters derived from Reactivation data
with those derived from the WISE cryogenic mission data show a $\sim30\%$
relative uncertainty. This larger uncertainty compared to data from the
cryogenic mission is due to the need to assume a beaming parameter for the fits
to the shorter wavelength data that the Reactivation mission is limited to. We
also present an analysis of the orbital parameters of the Main Belt asteroids
that have been discovered by NEOWISE during Reactivation, finding that these
objects tend to be on orbits that result in their perihelia being far from the
ecliptic, and thus missed by other surveys. To date, the NEOWISE Reactivation
survey has provided thermal fits of $1415$ unique NEOs. Including the mission
phases before spacecraft hibernation increases the count of unique NEOs
characterized to $1845$ from WISE's launch to the present.

and Gartner and Forrester have predicted that the use of LCD is very promising.
Giant companies, such as Microsoft, Mendix, and Outsystems have also launched
their LCD platforms. Aim: In this work, we explored two popular online
developer communities, Stack Overflow (SO) and Reddit, to provide insights on
the characteristics and challenges of LCD from a practitioners' perspective.
Method: We used two LCD related terms to search the relevant posts in SO and
extracted 73 posts. Meanwhile, we explored three LCD related subreddits from
Reddit and collected 228 posts. We extracted data from these posts and applied
the Constant Comparison method to analyze the descriptions, benefits, and
limitations and challenges of LCD. For platforms and programming languages used
in LCD, implementation units in LCD, supporting technologies of LCD, types of
applications developed by LCD, and domains that use LCD, we used descriptive
statistics to analyze and present the results. Results: Our findings show that:
(1) LCD may provide a graphical user interface for users to drag and drop with
little or even no code; (2) the equipment of out-of-the-box units (e.g., APIs
and components) in LCD platforms makes them easy to learn and use as well as
speeds up the development; (3) LCD is particularly favored in the domains that
have the need for automated processes and workflows; and (4) practitioners have
conflicting views on the advantages and disadvantages of LCD. Conclusions: Our
findings suggest that researchers should clearly define the terms when they
refer to LCD, and developers should consider whether the characteristics of LCD
are appropriate for their projects.

observes useful data $Y$ and wants to reveal the information to a user. Since
the useful data is correlated with the private data $X$, the agent employs a
privacy mechanism to generate data $U$ that can be released. We study the
privacy mechanism design that maximizes the revealed information about $Y$
while satisfying a strong $\ell_1$-privacy criterion. When a sufficiently small
leakage is allowed, we show that the optimizer vectors of the privacy mechanism
design problem have a specific geometry, i.e., they are perturbations of fixed
vector distributions. This geometrical structure allows us to use a local
approximation of the conditional entropy. By using this approximation the
original optimization problem can be reduced to a linear program so that an
approximate solution for privacy mechanism can be easily obtained. The main
contribution of this work is to consider non-zero leakage with a non-invertible
leakage matrix. In an example inspired by water mark application, we first
investigate the accuracy of the approximation. Then, we employ different
measures for utility and privacy leakage to compare the privacy-utility
trade-off using our approach with other methods. In particular, it has been
shown that by allowing small leakage, significant utility can be achieved using
our method compared to the case where no leakage is allowed.

multimodal research has seen limited resources to study (1) generalization
across domains and modalities, (2) complexity during training and inference,
and (3) robustness to noisy and missing modalities. In order to accelerate
progress towards understudied modalities and tasks while ensuring real-world
robustness, we release MultiBench, a systematic and unified large-scale
benchmark spanning 15 datasets, 10 modalities, 20 prediction tasks, and 6
research areas. MultiBench provides an automated end-to-end machine learning
pipeline that simplifies and standardizes data loading, experimental setup, and
model evaluation. To enable holistic evaluation, MultiBench offers a
comprehensive methodology to assess (1) generalization, (2) time and space
complexity, and (3) modality robustness. MultiBench introduces impactful
challenges for future research, including scalability to large-scale multimodal
datasets and robustness to realistic imperfections. To accompany this
benchmark, we also provide a standardized implementation of 20 core approaches
in multimodal learning. Simply applying methods proposed in different research
areas can improve the state-of-the-art performance on 9/15 datasets. Therefore,
MultiBench presents a milestone in unifying disjoint efforts in multimodal
research and paves the way towards a better understanding of the capabilities
and limitations of multimodal models, all the while ensuring ease of use,
accessibility, and reproducibility. MultiBench, our standardized code, and
leaderboards are publicly available, will be regularly updated, and welcomes
inputs from the community.

so that it sounds as if it was recorded in the same room as a reference
recording, with applications both in audio post-production and augmented
reality. In this work, we propose FiNS, a Filtered Noise Shaping network that
directly estimates the time domain room impulse response (RIR) from reverberant
speech. Our domain-inspired architecture features a time domain encoder and a
filtered noise shaping decoder that models the RIR as a summation of decaying
filtered noise signals, along with direct sound and early reflection
components. Previous methods for acoustic matching utilize either large models
to transform audio to match the target room or predict parameters for
algorithmic reverberators. Instead, blind estimation of the RIR enables
efficient and realistic transformation with a single convolution. An evaluation
demonstrates our model not only synthesizes RIRs that match parameters of the
target room, such as the $T_{60}$ and DRR, but also more accurately reproduces
perceptual characteristics of the target room, as shown in a listening test
when compared to deep learning baselines.

fields has recently sparked much interest. It enables a new type of
photon-induced near-field electron microscopy, mapping local optical near
fields around nanoparticles with exquisite spatial and spectral resolution and
lies at the heart of quantum state manipulation and attosecond pulse shaping of
free electrons. The corresponding interaction of optical near fields with slow
electrons has achieved much less attention, even though the lower electron
velocity may enhance electron-near-field coupling for small nanoparticles. A
first-principle theoretical study of such interactions has been reported very
recently [N. Talebi, Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 080401 (2020)]. Building up on this
work, we investigate, both analytically and numerically, the inelastic
scattering of slow electrons by near fields of small nanostructures. For weak
fields, this results in distinct angular diffraction patterns that represent,
to first order, the Fourier transform of the transverse variation of the scalar
near-field potential along the direction perpendicular to the electron
propagation. For stronger fields, scattering by the near-field component along
the electron trajectory results in a break-up of the energy spectrum into
multiple photon orders. Their angular diffraction patterns are given by integer
powers of the Fourier transform of the transverse potential variation and are
shifting in phase with photon order. Our analytical model offers an efficient
approach for studying the effects of electron kinetic energy, near field shape
and strength on the diffraction and thus may facilitate the experimental
observation of these phenomena by, e.g., ultrafast low-energy point-projection
microscopy or related techniques. This could provide simultaneous access to
different vectorial components of the optical near fields of small
nanoparticles.

on those measurements. In this work, we use a ten qubit QCCD trapped-ion
quantum computer to encode a single logical qubit using the $[[7,1,3]]$ color

initialized into the eigenstates of three mutually unbiased bases using an
encoding circuit, and we measure an average logical SPAM error of $1.7(6)

10^{-3}$ of our qubits. We then perform multiple syndrome measurements on the
encoded qubit, using a real-time decoder to determine any necessary corrections
that are done either as software updates to the Pauli frame or as physically
applied gates. Moreover, these procedures are done repeatedly while maintaining
coherence, demonstrating a dynamically protected logical qubit memory.
Additionally, we demonstrate non-Clifford qubit operations by encoding a
logical magic state with an error rate below the threshold required for magic
state distillation. Finally, we present system-level simulations that allow us
to identify key hardware upgrades that may enable the system to reach the

To shed light on this
problem, various Gedankenexperiments have been proposed. One popular example is
an interference experiment with a massive system that interacts gravitationally
with another distant system, where an apparent paradox arises: even for
space-like separation the outcome of the interference experiment depends on
actions on the distant system, leading to a violation of either complementarity
or no-signalling. A recent resolution shows that the paradox is avoided when
quantizing gravitational radiation and including quantum fluctuations of the
gravitational field. Here we show that the paradox in question can also be
resolved without considering gravitational radiation, relying only on the
Planck length as a limit on spatial resolution. Therefore, in contrast to
conclusions previously drawn, we find that the necessity for a quantum field
theory of gravity does not follow from so far considered Gedankenexperiments of
this type. In addition, we point out that in the common realization of the
setup the effects are governed by the mass octopole rather than the quadrupole.
Our results highlight that no Gedankenexperiment to date compels a quantum

which (i) adopt local prescriptions to connect star formation rates to heat
feedback, and (ii) assume that AGN disks self-regulate to a star-forming steady
state (with Toomre parameter Q=1), we find that feedback processes are both
temporally and spatially nonlocal. The accumulation of many stellar-mass black
holes (BHs) embedded in AGN gas eventually displaces radiation, winds and
supernovae from massive stars as the dominant feedback source. The nonlocality
of feedback heating, in combination with the need for heat to efficiently mix
throughout the gas, gives rise to steady-state AGN solutions that can have Q>>1
and no ongoing star formation. We find self-consistent steady-state solutions
in much of the parameter space of AGN mass and accretion rate. These solutions
harbor large populations of embedded compact objects that may grow in mass by
factors of a few over the AGN lifetime, including into the lower and upper mass

waves from massive black hole binaries (MBHBs), but no examples of binary
active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been confirmed. Because MBHBs are
intrinsically rare, the most promising detection methods utilize photometric
data from all-sky surveys. Recently D'Orazio & Di Stefano 2018
(arXiv:1707.02335) suggested gravitational self-lensing as a method of
detecting AGN in close separation binaries. In this study we calculate the
detectability of lensing signatures in realistic populations of simulated
MBHBs. Within our model assumptions, we find that VRO's LSST should be able to
detect 10s to 100s of self-lensing binaries, with the rate uncertainty
depending primarily on the orientation of AGN disks relative to their binary
orbits. Roughly a quarter of lensing detectable systems should also show
detectable Doppler boosting signatures. If AGN disks tend to be aligned with
the orbit, lensing signatures are very nearly achromatic, while in misaligned
configurations the bluer optical bands are lensed more than redder ones.
Whether substantial obscuring material (e.g.~a dusty torus) will be present in
close binaries remains uncertain, but our estimates suggest that a substantial
fraction of systems would still be observable in this case.

planets are common in the galaxy. Most of these observational methods are
biased toward detecting large planets near to their host stars. Because of
these observational biases, these systems can hide small, close-in planets or
far-orbiting (big or small) companions. These planets can still exert dynamical
influence on known planets and have such influence exerted upon them in turn.
In certain configurations, this influence can destabilize the system; in
others, the star's gravitational influence can instead further stabilize the
system. For example, in systems with planets close to the host star, effects
arising from general relativity can help to stabilize the configuration. We
derive criteria for hidden planets orbiting both beyond and within known
planets that quantify how strongly general relativistic effects can stabilize
systems that would otherwise be unstable. As a proof-of-concept, we investigate
the several planets in a system based on Kepler 56, and show that the outermost

an Earth-radius planet could be stable within this system if it orbits below

augment the simulated training set to be representative of the photometric
redshift distribution per supernovae class, the cadence of observations, and
the flux uncertainty distribution of the test set. Then we build a classifier
using the photometric transient classification library snmachine, based on
wavelet features obtained from Gaussian process fits, yielding similar
performance to the winning PLAsTiCC entry. We study the classification
performance for SNe with different properties within a single simulated
observing strategy. We find that season length is important, with light curves
of 150 days yielding the highest performance. Cadence also has an important
impact on SNe classification; events with median inter-night gap <3.5 days
yield higher classification performance. Interestingly, we find that large gaps
(>10 days) in light curve observations do not impact performance if sufficient
observations are available on either side, due to the effectiveness of the
Gaussian process interpolation. This analysis is the first exploration of the
impact of observing strategy on photometric supernova classification with LSST.

task. As the number of qubits within a device increases, a number of factors
contribute to decreases in yield and performance. To meet this challenge,
distributed architectures composed of many networked quantum computers have
been proposed as a viable path to scalability. Such systems will need
algorithms and compilers that are tailored to their distributed architectures.
In this work we introduce the Quantum Divide and Conquer Algorithm (QDCA) as a
general method for mapping large combinatorial optimization problems onto
distributed quantum architectures. This is achieved through the use of graph
partitioning and \textit{quantum circuit cutting} techniques. The QDCA is an
example of codesign -- allowing the features of both the distributed quantum
architectures and the compilation overheads of circuit cutting to inform the
algorithm design. The result of this cross-layer codesign is a highly flexible
algorithm which can be tuned to the amount of classical or quantum
computational resources that are available.
  The compilation techniques built into the QDCA are applicable to both near-
and long-term distributed quantum architectures. We simulate the execution of
the QDCA for near-term architectures and demonstrate the ability for many
smaller quantum processors to solve larger instances of the Maximum Independent
Set problem. We also observe improved performance as the amount of quantum
communication between subproblems is increased, motivating the development and
potential of large scale distributed quantum computing.

periods ($\sim$ 10$^{7}$ -10$^{8}$ yr) of powerful accretion. Major mergers are
commonly invoked as the most likely dissipative process to trigger the rapid
fueling of AGN. If the AGN-merger paradigm is true, we expect galaxy mergers to
coincide with black hole accretion during a heavily obscured AGN phase (N$_H$ $
> 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$). Starting from one of the largest samples of obscured AGN
at 0.5 $<$ $z$ $<$ 3.1, we select 40 non-starbursting lower-luminosity obscured

deep color \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} imaging and a novel method of human

obscured AGN are strongly associated with galaxies undergoing a major merger.
On the total sample of 80 galaxies, we estimate each individual classifier's

galaxies. We calculate the probability of each galaxy being in either a major
merger or isolated system, given the accuracy of the human classifiers and the
individual classifications of each galaxy. We do not find statistically
significant evidence that obscured AGN at cosmic noon are predominately found
in systems with evidence of significant merging/post-merging features.

the planetary outflow expands nearly spherically through its sonic surface

the degree of absorption is enhanced and the cometary tail leads to an extended
egress from transit. The crucial features of the wind--wind interaction are,
therefore, encapsulated in the light curve of He 1083 nm equivalent width as a

\equiv \Omega_M^{\rm grow}-\Omega_M^{\rm geom}$ and $\Delta w \equiv w^{\rm
grow}-w^{\rm geom}$, and (ii) investigating whether the $S_8$ tension between
the CMB and weak lensing can be translated into a tension between geometry and
growth, i.e. $\Delta\Omega_M \neq 0$, $\Delta w \neq 0$. In both the split
$\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ and $w {\rm CDM}$ cases, our results from combining all data
are consistent with $\Delta\Omega_M = 0$ and $\Delta w = 0$. If we omit BAO/RSD
data and constrain the split $w {\rm CDM}$ cosmology, we find the data prefers
$\Delta w<0$ at $3.6\sigma$ significance and $\Delta\Omega_M>0$ at $4.2\sigma$
evidence. We also find that for both CMB and weak lensing, $\Delta\Omega_M$ and
$S_8$ are correlated, with CMB showing a slightly stronger correlation. The
general broadening of the contours in our extended model does alleviate the
$S_8$ tension, but the allowed nonzero values of $\Delta\Omega_M$ do not
encompass the $S_8$ values that would point toward a mismatch between geometry
and growth as the origin of the tension.

shape and pose from noisy point cloud data. Relying on large amount of dataset
with ground-truth annotations, recent learning-based approaches predict
correspondences for every vertice on the point cloud; Chamfer distance is
usually used to minimize the distance between a deformed template model and the
input point cloud. However, Chamfer distance is quite sensitive to noise and
outliers, thus could be unreliable to assign correspondences. To address these
issues, we model the probability distribution of the input point cloud as
generated from a parametric human model under a Gaussian Mixture Model. Instead
of explicitly aligning correspondences, we treat the process of correspondence
search as an implicit probabilistic association by updating the posterior
probability of the template model given the input. A novel self-supervised loss
is further derived which penalizes the discrepancy between the deformed
template and the input point cloud conditioned on the posterior probability.
Our approach is very flexible, which works with both complete point cloud and
incomplete ones including even a single depth image as input. Compared to
previous self-supervised methods, our method shows the capability to deal with
substantial noise and outliers. Extensive experiments conducted on various
public synthetic datasets as well as a very noisy real dataset (i.e. CMU
Panoptic) demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over the
state-of-the-art methods.

galactic winds. Small-scale processes can dramatically affect global wind
properties. We run two-moment simulations of CR streaming to study how sound
waves are driven unstable by phase-shifted CR forces and CR heating. We verify
linear theory growth rates. As the sound waves grow non-linear, they steepen
into a quasi-periodic series of propagating shocks; the density jumps at shocks
create CR bottlenecks. The depth of a propagating bottleneck depends on both
the density jump and its velocity; {\Delta}P_c is smaller for rapidly moving
bottlenecks. A series of bottlenecks creates a CR staircase structure, which
can be understood from a convex hull construction. The system reaches a steady
state between growth of new perturbations, and stair mergers. CRs are decoupled
at plateaus, but exert intense forces and heating at stair jumps. The absence
of CR heating at plateaus leads to cooling, strong gas pressure gradients and
further shocks. If bottlenecks are stationary, they can drastically modify
global flows; if their propagation times are comparable to dynamical times,
their effects on global momentum and energy transfer are modest. The CR
acoustic instability is likely relevant in thermal interfaces between cold and
hot gas, as well as galactic winds. Similar to increased opacity in radiative
flows, the build-up of CR pressure due to bottlenecks can significantly
increase mass outflow rates, by up to an order of magnitude. It seeds unusual
forms of thermal instability, and the shocks could have distinct observational
signatures.

admits unitaries generating transitions between arbitrary subsystem relations,

many industries. Recently, there has been increasing interest in data-driven
methods, in order to exploit the large volume of data generated by such
computations. This paper introduces the idea of using spatially correlated
polynomial ridge functions for rapid flowfield estimation. Dimension reducing
ridge functions are obtained for numerous points within training flowfields.
The functions can then be used to predict flow variables for new, previously
unseen, flowfields. Their dimension reducing nature alleviates the problems
associated with visualising high dimensional datasets, enabling improved
understanding of design spaces and potentially providing valuable physical
insights.
  The proposed framework is computationally efficient; consisting of either
readily parallelisable tasks, or linear algebra operations. To further reduce
the computational cost, ridge functions need only be computed at only a small
number of subsampled locations. The flow physics encoded within covariance
matrices obtained from the training flowfields can then be used to predict flow
quantities, conditional upon those predicted by the ridge functions at the
sampled points.
  To demonstrate the efficacy of the framework, the incompressible flow around
an ensemble of aerofoils is used as a test case. On unseen aerofoils the ridge
functions' predictive accuracy is found to be reasonably competitive with a
state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN). The local ridge functions
can also be reused to obtain surrogate models for integral quantities such a
loss coefficient, which is advantageous in situations where long-term storage
of the CFD data is problematic. Finally, use of the ridge framework with
varying boundary conditions is demonstrated on a three dimensional transonic
wing flow.

are parameterized via the orbital parameters of the binary and the wind
mass-loss rate of the donor star, while the mass accretion rate, temperature
and luminosity of the WD are computed self-consistently. We explore the

traditional diagnostic diagrams used to distinguish symbiotic binaries from

differential equation, here viewed as the diffusion approximation to the
relativistic Boltzmann equation that describes the system. Being one of the few
examples where this diffusion approximation can be performed in great detail,
yielding the Bose-Einstein distribution as stationary solution, the Kompaneets
equation also provides the description of the so-called Sunyaev-Zeldovich
effect, which is the change of apparent brightness of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB) radiation. There are many ways of deriving this equation, but
one of them, which was proposed by Kompaneets in 1957 stands out for its
directness and simplicity. However, we point out in this work that there are
some inconsistencies regarding this traditional derivation that were repeated
by all the references we could find that follow the original framework of 1957.
This thesis is divided in two parts: in the first we will be interested in how
to deal with these inconsistencies, building the necessary basis in which the
diffusion approximation to the Boltzmann equation is consistently performed. In
the second part, we will be interested in possible extensions and beyond
reviewing some existing extensions, we will also show that a new setup
involving a master equation of a random walk with suitable chosen transition
rates in the photon reciprocal space furnishes not only Kompaneets equation but
also a first generalization to a system of bosons under a possible driving.

heavier black holes live in the AGN disk and tend to spin up into alignment

bulk disk mergers; 4) migration within the disk is non-uniform, likely
disrupted by feedback from migrators or disk turbulence; 5) dynamical

The database created contained 2,010 daily entries in which trade in futures
contracts occurred, as well as BGI spot sales in the market, from 1 December

analyse fluctuations in assets' value for longer periods. Bibliographic
research revealed that no other study has conducted a comprehensive analysis of
this commodity using this approach. Cattle ranching is big business in Brazil
given that in 2017, this sector moved 523.25 billion Brazilian reals (about
130.5 billion United States dollars). In that year, agribusiness contributed
22% of Brazil's total gross domestic product. Using the proposed risk modelling

within these investors' reach produce more effective risk management. The
methodology was based on Holt-Winters exponential smoothing algorithm,
autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), ARIMA with exogenous inputs,
generalised autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic and generalised

models (ROMs) of the flow and the associated feedback control laws is extremely
challenging. Despite the complexity of building data-driven ROMs for
turbulence, the superior representational capacity of deep neural networks has
demonstrated considerable success in learning ROMs. Nevertheless, these
strategies are typically devoid of physical foundations and often lack
interpretability. Conversely, the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) based
Galerkin projection (GP) approach for ROM has been popular in many problems
owing to its theoretically consistent and explainable physical foundations.
However, a key limitation is that the ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
arising from GP ROMs are highly susceptible to instabilities due to truncation
of POD modes and lead to deterioration in temporal predictions. In this work,
we propose a \textit{differentiable programming} approach that blends the
strengths of both these strategies, by embedding neural networks explicitly
into the GP ODE structure, termed Neural Galerkin projection. We demonstrate
this approach on the isentropic Navier-Stokes equations for compressible flow
over a cavity at a moderate Mach number. When provided the structure of the
projected equations, we show that the Neural Galerkin approach implicitly
learns stable ODE coefficients from POD coefficients and demonstrates
significantly longer and accurate time horizon predictions, when compared to
the classical POD-GP assisted by calibration. We observe that the key benefits
of this differentiable programming-based approach include increased flexibility
in physics-based learning, very low computational costs, and a significant
increase in interpretability, when compared to purely data-driven neural
networks.

show that, in the presence of a second Higgs doublet, SNR can be realized with
only a handful of new fermions which can be identified as viable dark matter

multivariate COM-Poisson (MultCOMP) model has desirable features such as (i) it
admits a flexible covariance matrix allowing for both negative and positive
non-diagonal entries; (ii) it overcomes the limitation of the existing
bivariate COM-Poisson distributions in the literature that do not have
COM-Poisson marginals; (iii) it allows for the analysis of multivariate counts
and is not just limited to bivariate counts. Inferential challenges are
presented by the likelihood specification as it depends on a number of
intractable normalizing constants involving the model parameters. These
obstacles motivate us to propose a Bayesian inferential approach where the
resulting doubly-intractable posterior is dealt with via the exchange algorithm
and the Grouped Independence Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Numerical
experiments based on simulations are presented to illustrate the proposed
Bayesian approach. We analyze the potential of the MultCOMP model through a
real data application on the numbers of goals scored by the home and away teams

effect of a lack of crowds during the COVID-19 pandemic on the well-known home

decreased number of goals scored by the home team, not accompanied by a reduced

samples of young stellar objects and pre-main sequence stars including all

stars is increased by analysing TESS observations and presenting discoveries in
CoRoT data. We employ MESA and GYRE to calculate evolutionary tracks of

pre-main sequence evolution, and their pulsation properties. The results are
then compared with observations to constrain the input physics. Results: We
discuss 16 formerly unknown pulsating pre-main sequence stars and candidates

conditions to Eddington Gray atmospheres; we discuss the future potential for
additional constraints by instability regions that are dependent on radial

precomputed cooling curves are typically used in numerical simulations. In the
literature, there exists a wide variety of cooling curves and they are quite
often used as unquestionable ingredients. We determine the effect of the
optically thin cooling curves on the formation and evolution of condensations.
We perform a case study using thermal instability as a mechanism to form in
situ condensations. We compare 2D numerical simulations with different cooling
curves using interacting slow magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves as trigger for
the thermal instability. Furthermore, we discuss a bootstrap measure to
investigate the far non-linear regime of thermal instability. In the appendix,
we include the details of all cooling curves implemented in MPI-AMRVAC and
briefly discuss a hydrodynamic variant of the slow MHD waves setup for thermal
instability. For all tested cooling curves, condensations are formed. However,
the growth rates of the thermal instability are different. Also, the morphology
of the formed condensation widely varies. We find fragmentation that is
affected by the low-temperature treatment of the cooling curves. Condensations
formed using cooling curves that vanish for temperatures lower than 20 000 K
seem to be more stable against dynamical instabilities. The non-linear regime
and fragmentation in the hydrodynamic case differ greatly from the MHD case. We
advocate the use of modern cooling curves, based on accurate computations and
up-to-date atomic parameters and solar abundances. Our bootstrap procedure can
be used in future multi-dimensional simulations, to study fine-structure

properties of the innermost ring at 44 au with former observations in total
intensity with the same instrument. In polarimetric imaging, we observed that
the intensity of the ring peaks in the south-east, mostly in the forward
direction, whereas in total intensity imaging, the ring is detected only at the
south. This noticeable characteristic suggests a non-uniform dust density in
the ring. We implemented a density function varying azimuthally along the ring
and generated synthetic images both in polarimetry and in total intensity,
which are then compared to the actual data. We find that the dust density peaks
in the south-west at an azimuthal angle of $220^{\circ} \sim 238^{\circ}$ with
a rather broad width of $61^{\circ} \sim 127^{\circ}$. Although there are still
uncertainties that remain in the determination of the anisotropic scattering
factor, the implementation of an azimuthal density variation to fit the data
proved to be robust. Upon elaborating on the origin of this dust density
distribution, we conclude that it could be the result of a massive collision
when we account for the effect of the high gas mass that is present in the

further measured the polarized scattering phase function for the observed
scattering angle between 33$^{\circ}$ and 147$^{\circ}$ as well as the spectral

eclipsing AM CVn systems with orbital periods of 61.5, 55.5, 53.3, 37.4, and
35.4 minutes. These systems were discovered by searching for deep eclipses in
the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) lightcurves of white dwarfs selected using
Gaia parallaxes. We obtained phase-resolved spectroscopy to confirm that all
systems are AM CVn binaries, and we obtained high-speed photometry to confirm
the eclipse and characterize the systems. The spectra of two long-period
systems (61.5 and 53.3 minutes) show many emission and absorption lines,
indicating the presence of N, O, Na, Mg, Si, and Ca, and also the K and Zn,
elements which have never been detected in AM CVn systems before. By modelling
the high-speed photometry, we measured the mass and radius of the donor star,
potentially constraining the evolutionary channel that formed these AM CVn
systems. We determined that the average mass of the accreting white dwarf is
$\approx0.8$$\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, and that the white dwarfs in long-period
systems are hotter than predicted by recently updated theoretical models. The
donors have a high entropy and are a factor of $\approx$ 2 more massive
compared to zero-entropy donors at the same orbital period. The large donor
radius is most consistent with He-star progenitors, although the observed
spectral features seem to contradict this. The discovery of 5 new eclipsing
AM~CVn systems is consistent with the known observed AM CVn space density and
estimated ZTF recovery efficiency. Based on this estimate, we expect to find
another 1--4 eclipsing AM CVn systems as ZTF continues to obtain data. This

oscillating, whereby oscillations are sustained by cyclic dominance among
different combinations of cooperators, defectors, and punishers. We also
observe a novel route to cyclic dominance where cooperators, punishers, and
defectors enter a coexistence via an inverse Hopf bifurcation that is followed
by an inverse period doubling route.

of no indirect effect is a composite null hypothesis, as the null holds if
either regression coefficient is zero. A consequence is that existing
hypothesis tests are either severely underpowered near the origin (i.e., when
both coefficients are small with respect to standard errors) or do not preserve
type 1 error uniformly over the null hypothesis space. We propose hypothesis
tests that (i) preserve level alpha type 1 error, (ii) meaningfully improve
power when both true underlying effects are small relative to sample size, and
(iii) preserve power when at least one is not. One approach gives a closed-form
test that is minimax optimal with respect to local power over the alternative

approximately optimal test for a Bayes risk criterion. We provide an R package

degrades in real-world settings where meta-learners must learn from a wide and

shift exists between meta-train and meta-test task distributions. These issues
are typically hard to study since the shape of task distributions, and shift

often occurs naturally in modeling applications when an expected disparity
exists in the quality of information between different feature sets. Its
presence can cause traditional and modern model selection methods to fail
because such procedures commonly presume that each potential parameter is
equally worthy of entering into the final model - we call this presumption
""covariate equipoise"". However, this presumption does not always hold,
especially in the presence of derived variables. For instance, when all
possible interactions are considered as candidate predictors, the premise of
covariate equipoise will often produce over-specified and opaque models. The
sheer number of additional candidate variables grossly inflates the number of
false discoveries in the interactions, resulting in unnecessarily complex and
difficult-to-interpret models with many (truly spurious) interactions. We
suggest a modeling strategy that requires a stronger level of evidence in order
to allow certain variables (e.g. interactions) to be selected in the final
model. This ranked sparsity paradigm can be implemented with the
sparsity-ranked lasso (SRL). We compare the performance of SRL relative to
competing methods in a series of simulation studies, showing that the SRL is a
very attractive method because it is fast, accurate, and produces more
transparent models (with fewer false interactions). We illustrate its utility
in an application to predict the survival of lung cancer patients using a set
of gene expression measurements and clinical covariates, searching in
particular for gene-environment interactions.

a variety of fields. For example, in bioinformatics, they are crucial for
analyses of single-cell data such as mass cytometry (CyTOF) data. Some of the
most effective algorithms for clustering HD data are based on representing the
data by nodes in a graph, with edges connecting neighbouring nodes according to
some measure of similarity or distance. However, users of graph-based
algorithms are typically faced with the critical but challenging task of
choosing the value of an input parameter that sets the size of neighbourhoods
in the graph, e.g. the number of nearest neighbours to which to connect each
node or a threshold distance for connecting nodes. The burden on the user could
be alleviated by a measure of inter-node similarity that can have value 0 for
dissimilar nodes without requiring any user-defined parameters or thresholds.
This would determine the neighbourhoods automatically while still yielding a
sparse graph. To this end, I propose a new method called ASTRICS to measure
similarity between clusters of HD data points based on local dimensionality
reduction and triangulation of critical alpha shapes. I show that my ASTRICS
similarity measure can facilitate both clustering and visualization of HD data
by using it in Stage 2 of a three-stage pipeline: Stage 1 = perform an initial
clustering of the data by any method; Stage 2 = let graph nodes represent
initial clusters instead of individual data points and use ASTRICS to
automatically define edges between nodes; Stage 3 = use the graph for further
clustering and visualization. This trades the critical task of choosing a graph
neighbourhood size for the easier task of essentially choosing a resolution at
which to view the data. The graph and consequently downstream clustering and
visualization are then automatically adapted to the chosen resolution.

matches a set of observations is complicated by the need for any proposed
heating model to simultaneously satisfy multiple observable constraints. In
this paper, we train a random forest classification model on a set of
forward-modeled observable quantities, namely the emission measure slope, the
peak temperature of the emission measure distribution, and the time lag and
maximum cross-correlation between multiple pairs of AIA channels. We then use
our trained model to classify the heating frequency in every pixel of active
region NOAA 1158 using the observed emission measure slopes, peak temperatures,
time lags, and maximum cross-correlations and are able to map the heating
frequency across the entire active region. We find that high-frequency heating
dominates in the inner core of the active region while intermediate frequency
dominates closer to the periphery of the active region. Additionally, we assess
the importance of each observed quantity in our trained classification model

with which heating frequency a given pixel is most consistent. The technique
presented here offers a very promising and widely applicable method for
assessing observations in terms of detailed forward models given an arbitrary

distribution by directly reducing the abundance of pre-existing mini-halos
($\lesssim 10^7 M_{\bigodot}$) that could be destroyed by reionization and
indirectly modulating reionization history via photoionization within these
mini-halos. In this work, we investigate the effect of streaming velocity on
the BAO feature in HI 21 cm intensity mapping after reionization, with a focus
on redshifts $3.5\lesssim z\lesssim5.5$. We build a spatially modulated halo
model that includes the dependence of the filtering mass on the local

fiducial model, we find isotropic streaming velocity bias coefficients $b_v$
ranging from $-0.0043$ at $z=3.5$ to $-0.0273$ at $z=5.5$, which indicates that
the BAO scale is stretched (i.e., the peaks shift to lower $k$). In particular,
streaming velocity shifts the transverse BAO scale between 0.121% ($z=3.5$) and
0.35% ($z=5.5$) and shifts the radial BAO scale between 0.167% ($z=3.5$) and
0.505% ($z=5.5$). These shifts exceed the projected error bars from the more

multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems with a reduced number of
radio-frequency (RF) chains. Importantly, other than the knowledge of channel
correlation matrices, we make no assumption as to the structure of the channel.
To address the limitation in the number of RF chains, we employ hybrid
beamforming, comprising a low dimensional digital beamformer followed by an
analog beamformer implemented using phase shifters. Since there is no dedicated
RF chain per transmitter/receiver antenna, the conventional channel estimation
techniques for fully-digital systems are impractical. By exploiting the fact
that the channel entries are uncorrelated in its eigen-domain, we seek to
estimate the channel entries in this domain. Due to the limited number of RF
chains, channel estimation is typically performed in multiple time slots. Under
a total energy budget, we aim to design the hybrid transmit beamformer
(precoder) and the receive beamformer (combiner) in each training time slot, in
order to estimate the channel using the minimum mean squared error criterion.
To this end, we choose the precoder and combiner in each time slot such that
they are aligned to transmitter and receiver eigen-directions, respectively.
Further, we derive a water-filling-type expression for the optimal energy
allocation at each time slot. This expression illustrates that, with a low
training energy budget, only significant components of the channel need to be
estimated. In contrast, with a large training energy budget, the energy is
almost equally distributed among all eigen-directions. Simulation results show
that the proposed channel estimation scheme can efficiently estimate correlated
massive MIMO channels within a few training time slots.

feasible in polynomial time. We then conjecture that graph alignment is not
feasible in polynomial time when the associated tree detection problem is
impossible. If true, this conjecture together with our sufficient conditions on
tree detection impossibility would imply the existence of a hard phase for
graph alignment, i.e. a parameter range where alignment cannot be done in
polynomial time even though it is known to be feasible in non-polynomial time.

  Convolution","23 pages",,,,"cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Computing the convolution $A\star B$ of two length-$n$ integer vectors $A,B$
is a core problem in several disciplines. It frequently comes up in algorithms
for Knapsack, $k$-SUM, All-Pairs Shortest Paths, and string pattern matching
problems. For these applications it typically suffices to compute convolutions
of nonnegative vectors. This problem can be classically solved in time $O(n\log
n)$ using the Fast Fourier Transform.
  However, often the involved vectors are sparse and hence one could hope for
output-sensitive algorithms to compute nonnegative convolutions. This question
was raised by Muthukrishnan and solved by Cole and Hariharan (STOC '02) by a
randomized algorithm running in near-linear time in the (unknown) output-size
$t$. Chan and Lewenstein (STOC '15) presented a deterministic algorithm with a
$2^{O(\sqrt{\log t\cdot\log\log n})}$ overhead in running time and the
additional assumption that a small superset of the output is given; this
assumption was later removed by Bringmann and Nakos (ICALP '21).
  In this paper we present the first deterministic near-linear-time algorithm
for computing sparse nonnegative convolutions. This immediately gives improved
deterministic algorithms for the state-of-the-art of output-sensitive Subset
Sum, block-mass pattern matching, $N$-fold Boolean convolution, and others,
matching up to log-factors the fastest known randomized algorithms for these
problems. Our algorithm is a blend of algebraic and combinatorial ideas and
techniques.
  Additionally, we provide two fast Las Vegas algorithms for computing sparse
nonnegative convolutions. In particular, we present a simple $O(t\log^2t)$ time
algorithm, which is an accessible alternative to Cole and Hariharan's
algorithm. We further refine this new algorithm to run in Las Vegas time
$O(t\log t\cdot\log\log t)$, matching the running time of the dense case apart
from the $\log\log t$ factor.

theory, which require a sharpening of existing tools for handling polynomial

parameters that are analogous to the gap and the Debye cut-off energy of the

evidence for pairing at $\nu=5/2$. To a good approximation, the highest overlap
between the exact Coulomb ground state at $\nu=5/2$ and the BCS state is
obtained for parameters that minimize the energy of the latter, thereby
providing support for the physics of composite-fermion pairing as the mechanism
for the $5/2$ fractional quantum Hall effect. We discuss the issue of modular
covariance of the composite-fermion BCS wave function, and calculate its Hall
viscosity and pair correlation function. By similar methods, we look for but do

$\lambda$, in light of cluster dynamics. Our sample consists of 126 clusters
with sufficient spectroscopy for individual velocity dispersion estimates. We
examine the correlations between cluster velocity dispersion, richness, X-ray
temperature and luminosity as well as central galaxy velocity offsets. The
velocity dispersion-richness relation exhibits a bimodal distribution. The
majority of clusters follow scaling relations between velocity dispersion,
richness, and X-ray properties similar to those found for previous samples;
however, there is a significant population of clusters with velocity
dispersions which are high for their richness. These clusters account for
roughly 22\% of the $\lambda < 70$ systems in our sample, but more than half
(55\%) of $\lambda < 70$ clusters at $z>0.5$. A couple of these systems are hot
and X-ray bright as expected for massive clusters with richnesses that appear
to have been underestimated, but most appear to have high velocity dispersions
for their X-ray properties likely due to line-of-sight structure. These results
suggest that projection effects contribute significantly to redMaPPer
selection, particularly at higher redshifts and lower richnesses. The redMaPPer
determined richnesses for the velocity dispersion outliers are consistent with
their X-ray properties, but several are X-ray undetected and deeper data is
needed to understand their nature.

the consistency of the Standard Model (SM) with the Second Law of
Thermodynamics requires the early universe CBR to be composed mainly of an
SU(2) gauge field. The U(1) field would be suppressed. One of the consequences
of this approach is that the Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) would be
able to propagate much further than conventionally accepted, as an SU(2)
dominant CBR would be largely unable to couple with right handed fermions. I
test if this novel theory solves the problem of UHECR origin by finding
suitable candidates up to a redshift z = 0.1 within three degrees of the
arrival direction. Utilizing the Fly's Eye Northern Hemisphere UHECR data, I
identified candidates with 80\% success for the Northern Sky UHECR (98.7\% if
certain celestial objects which are likely to be Active Galactic Nuclei are
absolutely identified as such). This is parsimonious with the CBR theory, which
has other important implications for the Standard Model, early universe
cosmology, and the origin of matter and anti-matter. This builds off of Tipler
and Piasecki (2018), where we have reviewed UHECR data from the Southern
Hemisphere to get a 86\% success identification rate. We predict that the
remaining UHECR not paired with a potential source will have sources identified
upon closer telescopic investigations of these regions. Other recent
experiments further suggest an SU(2) dominant composition of the CBR photons.
The problem of UHECR origin may be solved.

Recently, multi-task learning has been applied to KWS to exploit both ASR and

into two branches for the two tasks, one for phoneme transcription trained with

from a phonetic encoder by performing cross attention between the encoder
outputs and a trainable query sequence to predict a confidence score for the

learning solutions for image upsampling are currently trained using either
resize or sub-pixel convolution to learn kernels that generate high fidelity
images with minimal artifacts. However, performing inference with these learned
convolution kernels requires memory-intensive feature map transformations that
dominate time and energy costs in real-time applications. To alleviate this
pressure on memory bandwidth, we confine the use of resize or sub-pixel
convolution to training in the cloud by transforming learned convolution
kernels to deconvolution kernels before deploying them for inference as a
functionally equivalent deconvolution. These kernel transformations, intended
as a one-time cost when shifting from training to inference, enable a systems
designer to use each algorithm in their optimal context by preserving the image
fidelity learned when training in the cloud while minimizing data transfer
penalties during inference at the edge. We also explore existing variants of
deconvolution inference algorithms and introduce a novel variant for
consideration. We analyze and compare the inference properties of
convolution-based upsampling algorithms using a quantitative model of incurred
time and energy costs and show that using deconvolution for inference at the
edge improves both system latency and energy efficiency when compared to their
sub-pixel or resize convolution counterparts.

communication mechanisms is an important field of neuroscience. In the absence
of high quality data on humans, mouse vocalization experiments in laboratory
settings have been proven to be useful in providing valuable insights into
mammalian vocal development and evolution, including especially the impact of
certain genetic mutations. Data sets from mouse vocalization experiments
usually consist of categorical syllable sequences along with continuous
inter-syllable interval times for mice of different genotypes vocalizing under
various contexts. Few statistical models have considered the inference for both
transition probabilities and inter-state intervals. The latter is of particular
importance as increased inter-state intervals can be an indication of possible
vocal impairment. In this paper, we propose a class of novel Markov renewal
mixed models that capture the stochastic dynamics of both state transitions and
inter-state interval times. Specifically, we model the transition dynamics and
the inter-state intervals using Dirichlet and gamma mixtures, respectively,
allowing the mixture probabilities in both cases to vary flexibly with fixed
covariate effects as well as random individual-specific effects. We apply our
model to analyze the impact of a mutation in the Foxp2 gene on mouse vocal
behavior. We find that genotypes and social contexts significantly affect the
inter-state interval times but, compared to previous analyses, the influences
of genotype and social context on the syllable transition dynamics are weaker.

with respect to the entrywise $\ell_p$-norm with $1 \leq p < 2$. We study the
$\ell_p$ norm loss since it is often considered more robust to noise than the
standard Frobenius norm. Given an input matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$
($n \gg d$), our algorithm achieves a multiplicative $k^{\frac{1}{p} -
\frac{1}{2}}\text{poly}(\log nd)$-approximation to the error with respect to
the best possible column subset of size $k$. Furthermore, the space complexity
of the streaming algorithm is optimal up to a logarithmic factor. Our streaming
algorithm also extends naturally to a 1-round distributed protocol with nearly
optimal communication cost. A key ingredient in our algorithms is a reduction
to column subset selection in the $\ell_{p,2}$-norm, which corresponds to the
$p$-norm of the vector of Euclidean norms of each of the columns of $A$. This
enables us to leverage strong coreset constructions for the Euclidean norm,
which previously had not been applied in this context. We also give the first
provable guarantees for greedy column subset selection in the $\ell_{1, 2}$
norm, which can be used as an alternative, practical subroutine in our
algorithms. Finally, we show that our algorithms give significant practical
advantages on real-world data analysis tasks.

  identification in chromatographic analysis",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Retention time drift caused by fluctuations in physical factors such as
temperature ramping rate and carrier gas flow rate is ubiquitous in
chromatographic measurements. Proper peak identification and alignment across
different chromatograms is critical prior to any subsequent analysis. This work
introduces a peak identification method called retention time trajectory (RTT)
matching, which uses chromatographic retention times as the only input and
identifies peaks associated with any subset of a predefined set of target
compounds. RTT matching is also capable of reporting interferents. An RTT is a
2-dimensional (2D) curve formed uniquely by the retention times of the
chromatographic peaks. The RTTs obtained from the chromatogram of a test sample
and of pre-characterized library are matched and statistically compared. The
best matched pair implies identification. Unlike most existing peak alignment
methods, no mathematical warping or transformations are involved. Based on the
experimentally characterized RTT, an RTT hybridization method is developed to
rapidly generate more RTTs without performing actual time-consuming
chromatographic measurements. This enables successful identification even for
chromatograms with serious retention time drift. Experimentally obtained gas
chromatograms and publicly available fruit metabolomics liquid chromatograms
are used to generate over two trillions of tests that validate the proposed
method, demonstrating real-time peak/interferent identification.

brings advantages to RL algorithms by canceling out errors under mild

constant weighting coefficient and do not consider cases where the coefficient
is allowed to change dynamically. In this paper, we study the dynamic
coefficient scheme and present the first asymptotic error bound. Based on the
dynamic coefficient error bound, we propose an effective scheme to tune the
coefficient according to the magnitude of error in favor of more robust
learning. Complementing this development, we propose a novel algorithm,
Geometric Value Iteration (GVI), that features a dynamic error-aware KL
coefficient design with the aim of mitigating the impact of errors on
performance. Our experiments demonstrate that GVI can effectively exploit the
trade-off between learning speed and robustness over uniform averaging of a
constant KL coefficient. The combination of GVI and deep networks shows stable
learning behavior even in the absence of a target network, where algorithms
with a constant KL coefficient would greatly oscillate or even fail to
converge.

minimisers of $L^p$-mean distortion. The classical result is that there is an
extremal map of Teichm\""uller type with associated holomorphic quadratic

$L^p$-norm, when $p=1$ it is known that there can be no locally quasiconformal

cannot be in $W^{1,2}_{loc}(\ID)$ unless $r=0$ and $f=identity$. Hence there is
no locally quasiconformal minimiser. A similar statement holds for minimsers of
the exponential norm of distortion. We also use our earlier work to show that
as $p\to\infty$, the weak $L^p$-minimisers converge locally uniformly in $\ID$

unravelled at finite temperature bias, which stems from the suppression of
cyclic heat transitions and large mismatch of two squeezed photon modes at weak

rectification is also exhibited at large temperature bias. It is found that the
intrinsically asymmetric structure of the hybrid system and negative

strong hybridization at small and large temperature bias limits, respectively.

have become a popular technique for tracing ECG signals, outperforming human
experts. Despite this, convolutional neural networks are susceptible to
adversarial examples that can misclassify ECG signals and decrease the model's
precision. Moreover, they do not generalize well on the out-of-distribution
dataset. The GAN architecture has been employed in recent works to synthesize
adversarial ECG signals to increase existing training data. However, they use a
disjointed CNN-based classification architecture to detect arrhythmia. Till
now, no versatile architecture has been proposed that can detect adversarial
examples and classify arrhythmia simultaneously. To alleviate this, we propose
a novel Conditional Generative Adversarial Network to simultaneously generate
ECG signals for different categories and detect cardiac abnormalities.
Moreover, the model is conditioned on class-specific ECG signals to synthesize
realistic adversarial examples. Consequently, we compare our architecture and
show how it outperforms other classification models in normal/abnormal ECG
signal detection by benchmarking real world and adversarial signals.

theories in the presence of both the non-minimal coupling between the scalar
field and curvature, and the Galileon self-interaction of the scalar field.
Furthermore, we give predictions for the duration of reheating as well as for
the reheating temperature after inflation. After working out the expressions
for the power spectra of scalar and tensor perturbations in the case of a
general non-minimal coupling function that depends solely on the scalar field
and a general scalar potential, we focus on the special cases of the power-law
coupling function and chaotic quadratic inflation. Thus, under the slow-roll
approximation we confront the predictions of the model with the current PLANCK
constraints on the spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$
using the $n_{s}-r$ plane. We found that the combination of the non-minimal
coupling and Galileon self-interaction effects allows us to obtain better
results for $r$ than in the case in which each effect is considered separately.
Particularly, we obtained that the predictions of the model are in agreement
with the current observational bounds on $n_{s}$ and $r$ within the $95 \%$ C.L
region and also slightly inside the $68 \%$ C.L region. Also, we investigate
the oscillatory regime after the end of inflation by solving the full
background equations, and then we determine the upper bound for the Galileon
and non-minimal coupling parameters under the condition that the scalar field
oscillates coherently during reheating. Finally, after approximating reheating
by a constant equation of state, we derive the relations between the reheating
duration, the temperature at the end of reheating, its equation of state, and
the number of $e$-folds of inflation and then we relate them all to the
inflationary observables.

a near-net shape, a combination of intended nominal geometry and sacrificial
support structures, which need to be removed in a subsequent post-processing
stage using subtractive manufacturing (SM). In this paper, we present a
framework for optimizing the build orientation with respect to removability of
support structures. In particular, given a general multi-axis machining setup
and sampled build orientations, we define a Pareto-optimality criterion based
on the total support volume and the ""secluded"" support volume defined as the
support volume that is not accessible by a given set of machining tools. Since
total support volume mainly depends on the build orientation and the secluded
volume is dictated by the machining setup, in many cases the two objectives are
competing and their trade-off needs to be taken into account. The accessibility
analysis relies on the inaccessibility measure field (IMF), which is a
continuous field in the Euclidean space that quantifies the inaccessibility of
each point given a collection of tools and fixturing devices. The value of IMF
at each point indicates the minimum possible volumetric collision between
objects in relative motion including the part, fixtures, and the tools, over
all possible tool orientations and sharp points on the tool. We also propose an
automated support removal planning algorithm based on IMF, where a sequence of
actions are provided in terms of the fixturing devices, cutting tools, and tool
orientation at each step. In our approach, each step is chosen based on the
maximal removable volume to iteratively remove accessible supports. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through benchmark
examples in 2D and realistic examples in 3D.

deterministic swapping, the key ingredient is the maximal entanglement that was
initially contained in two pairs of qubits and the capacity of projecting onto
a Bell basis. Thus the basic and deterministic entanglement swapping scheme
involves three maximal level of entanglement. In this work we propose
probabilistic entanglement swapping processes performed with different amounts
of initial entanglement. Besides that we suggest a non Bell measuring-basis, to
introduce a third entanglement level in the process. Additionally, we propose
the \emph{unambiguous state extraction scheme} as the local mechanism for
probabilistically achieving the EPR projection. The combination of these three
elements allows us to design four strategies for performing probabilistic
entanglement swapping. Surprisingly, we find a twofold entanglement threshold
effect related to the concurrence of the measuring-basis. Specifically, the
maximal probability of accomplishing a EPR projection becomes a constant for
concurrences higher than or equal to threshold entanglement value. Thus, we
show that maximal entanglement in the measuring-basis is not required for

self-supervised method has recently achieved state-of-the-art performances in
learning representative data features by maximising mutual information between
different augmented views. However, existing data augmentation techniques for
contrastive learning are not designed to learn physiological signals from
videos and often fail when there are complicated noise and subtle and periodic
colour or shape variations between video frames. To address these problems, we
present a novel self-supervised spatiotemporal learning framework for remote
physiological signal representation learning, where there is a lack of labelled
training data. Firstly, we propose a landmark-based spatial augmentation that
splits the face into several informative parts based on the Shafer dichromatic
reflection model to characterise subtle skin colour fluctuations. We also
formulate a sparsity-based temporal augmentation exploiting Nyquist-Shannon
sampling theorem to effectively capture periodic temporal changes by modelling
physiological signal features. Furthermore, we introduce a constrained
spatiotemporal loss which generates pseudo-labels for augmented video clips. It
is used to regulate the training process and handle complicated noise. We
evaluated our framework on 3 public datasets and demonstrated superior

have seen limited application in safety-critical domains such as robotics near
and around humans. This is because it remains an open challenge to train a
neural network to obey safety constraints. Most existing safety-related methods
only seek to verify that already-trained networks obey constraints, requiring
alternating training and verification. Instead, this work proposes a
constrained method to simultaneously train and verify a feedforward neural
network with rectified linear unit (ReLU) nonlinearities. Constraints are
enforced by computing the network's output-space reachable set and ensuring
that it does not intersect with unsafe sets; training is achieved by
formulating a novel collision-check loss function between the reachable set and
unsafe portions of the output space. The reachable and unsafe sets are
represented by constrained zonotopes, a convex polytope representation that
enables differentiable collision checking. The proposed method is demonstrated
successfully on a network with one nonlinearity layer and approximately 50
parameters.

raising significant challenges for the algorithm efficiency, especially its
applications on resource-limited platforms. Current segmentation models are
trained and evaluated on massive high-resolution scene images (""data level"")
and suffer from the expensive computation arising from the required multi-scale
aggregation(""network level""). In both folds, the computational and energy costs
in training and inference are notable due to the often desired large input
resolutions and heavy computational burden of segmentation models. To this end,
we propose DANCE, general automated DAta-Network Co-optimization for Efficient
segmentation model training and inference. Distinct from existing efficient
segmentation approaches that focus merely on light-weight network design, DANCE
distinguishes itself as an automated simultaneous data-network co-optimization
via both input data manipulation and network architecture slimming.
Specifically, DANCE integrates automated data slimming which adaptively
downsamples/drops input images and controls their corresponding contribution to
the training loss guided by the images' spatial complexity. Such a downsampling
operation, in addition to slimming down the cost associated with the input size
directly, also shrinks the dynamic range of input object and context scales,
therefore motivating us to also adaptively slim the network to match the
downsampled data. Extensive experiments and ablating studies (on four SOTA
segmentation models with three popular segmentation datasets under two training
settings) demonstrate that DANCE can achieve ""all-win"" towards efficient
segmentation(reduced training cost, less expensive inference, and better mean
Intersection-over-Union (mIoU)).

state-of-the-art performance in the presence of substantial appearance change.
However, existing systems 1) do not fully utilize odometry data within the

assumption that query traverses exactly repeat the mapping traverse. To address
these shortcomings, we present a new probabilistic topometric localization
system which incorporates full 3-dof odometry into the motion model and
furthermore, adds an ""off-map"" state within the state-estimation framework,
allowing query traverses which feature significant route detours from the

multiple query traverses from the Oxford RobotCar dataset exhibiting both
significant appearance change and deviations from routes previously traversed.

computational challenges due to their high-dimensionality and data-sparsity,
also known as `dropout' events. Recently, Regularized Auto-Encoder (RAE) based
deep neural network models have achieved remarkable success in learning robust
low-dimensional representations. The basic idea in RAEs is to learn a
non-linear mapping from the high-dimensional data space to a low-dimensional
latent space and vice-versa, simultaneously imposing a distributional prior on
the latent space, which brings in a regularization effect. This paper argues
that RAEs suffer from the infamous problem of bias-variance trade-off in their
naive formulation. While a simple AE without a latent regularization results in
data over-fitting, a very strong prior leads to under-representation and thus
bad clustering. To address the above issues, we propose a modified RAE
framework (called the scRAE) for effective clustering of the single-cell RNA
sequencing data. scRAE consists of deterministic AE with a flexibly learnable
prior generator network, which is jointly trained with the AE. This facilitates
scRAE to trade-off better between the bias and variance in the latent space. We
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method through extensive
experimentation on several real-world single-cell Gene expression datasets.

that injecting explicit inductive bias in the model, in form of general
physical laws, can help not only make the model more interpretable, but also
improve the overall prediction of model. As a natural by-product, our model can
learn feature maps which closely resemble actual object positions in the image,
without having any explicit supervision about the object positions at the
training time. In comparison with earlier works \cite{jaques&al20}, which
assume a complete knowledge of the dynamics governing the motion in the form of
a physics engine, we rely only on the knowledge of general physical laws, such
as, world consists of objects, which have position and velocity. We propose an
additional decoder based loss in the pixel space, imposed in a curriculum
manner, to further refine the latent space predictions. Experiments in multiple
different settings demonstrate that while Kipf et al. model is effective at
capturing object interactions, our model can be significantly more effective at
localising objects, resulting in improved performance in 3 out of 4 domains

indeed elucidate the principal working mechanisms of those quantum devices. The

phylogenetic trees that are embedded in such a network is a recurring task.
From an algorithmic viewpoint, this analysis almost always requires an
exhaustive search of a particular multiset $S$ of rooted phylogenetic trees
that are embedded in a rooted phylogenetic network $\mathcal{N}$. Since the
size of $S$ is exponential in the number of reticulations of $\mathcal{N}$, it
is consequently of interest to keep this number as small as possible but
without loosing any element of $S$. In this paper, we take a first step towards
this goal by introducing the notion of a non-essential arc of $\mathcal{N}$,
which is an arc whose deletion from $\mathcal{N}$ results in a rooted
phylogenetic network $\mathcal{N}'$ such that the sets of rooted phylogenetic
trees that are embedded in $\mathcal{N}$ and $\mathcal{N}'$ are the same. We
investigate the popular class of tree-child networks and characterize which
arcs are non-essential. This characterization is based on a family of directed
graphs. Using this novel characterization, we show that identifying and
deleting all non-essential arcs in a tree-child network takes time that is
cubic in the number of leaves of the network. Moreover, we show that deciding
if a given arc of an arbitrary phylogenetic network is non-essential is
$\Pi_2^P$-complete.

Turbulence can help seed thermal instability by generating density
fluctuations, and mix the hot and cold phases together to produce intermediate
temperature gas ($10^4$--$10^7$ $\mathrm{K}$) with short cooling times. We
conduct high resolution ($384^3$--$768^3$ resolution elements) idealised
simulations of the multiphase ICM and study the effects of turbulence strength,
characterised by $f_{\mathrm{turb}}$ ($0.001$--$1.0$), the ratio of turbulent
forcing power to the net radiative cooling rate. We analyse density and
temperature distribution, amplitude and nature of gas perturbations, and
probability of transitions across the temperature phases. We also study the
effects of mass and volume-weighted thermal heating and weak ICM magnetic
fields. For low $f_{\mathrm{turb}}$, the gas is distribution is bimodal between
the hot and cold phases. The mixing between different phases becomes more
efficient with increasing $f_{\mathrm{turb}}$, producing larger amounts of the

generates larger density fluctuations and faster cooling, The rms logarithmic
pressure fluctuation scaling with Mach number
$\sigma_{\ln{\bar{P}}}^2\approx\ln(1+b^2\gamma^2\mathcal{M}^4)$ is unaffected

difficulty that as ferromagnets become smaller, it becomes more difficult to

thus research on antiferromagnetic spintronics has developed into a

expand the area of antiferromagnetic spintronics to the hitherto elusive level
of individual molecules. In contrast to all previous work on molecular
spintronics, our detection scheme of the molecule's spin state does not rely on
a magnetic moment. Instead, we use field-effect transistor devices constituting
of an isolated, contacted single-wall carbon nanotube covalently bound to a
limited number of molecular antiferromagnets incorporating four Mn(II) or
Co(II) ions. Time-dependent quantum transport measurement along the
functionalized nanotube show step-like transitions between several distinct
current levels, which we attribute to transitions between different
antiferromagnetic states of individual molecular complexes grafted on the
nanotube. A statistical analysis of the switching events using factorial
cumulants indicates that the cobalt complexes switch independently from each
other, while a coherent superposition of the antiferromagnetic spin states of
the molecules along the nanotube is observed for the manganese complexes. The
long coherence time (several seconds at 100 mK) is made possible by the absence
of spin and orbital momentum in the relevant states of the manganese complex,
while the cobalt complex includes a significant orbital momentum contribution
due to the pseudo-octahedral d$^7$ metal centers.

TsK^{op} has the free exponential, which is shown to be describable in terms of

However, as an implication of recent lower bounds on adaptive control, this

candidate 6G technology, aiming to unify the two key operations of the future
network in spectrum/energy/cost efficient way. ISAC involves communicating
information to receivers and simultaneously sensing targets, while both
operations use the same waveforms, the same transmitter and ultimately the same
network infrastructure. Nevertheless, the inclusion of information signalling
into the probing waveform for target sensing raises unique and difficult
challenges from the perspective of information security. At the same time, the
sensing capability incorporated in the ISAC transmission offers unique
opportunities to design secure ISAC techniques. This overview paper discusses
these unique challenges and opportunities for the next generation of ISAC
networks. We first briefly discuss the fundamentals of waveform design for
sensing and communication. Then, we detail the challenges and contradictory
objectives involved in securing ISAC transmission, along with state-of-the-art
approaches to address them. We then identify the new opportunity of using the
sensing capability to obtain knowledge of the targets, as an enabling approach
against known weaknesses of PHY security. Finally, we illustrate a low-cost
secure ISAC architecture, followed by a series of open research topics. This
family of sensing-aided secure ISAC techniques brings a new insight on
providing information security, with an eye on robust and hardware-constrained
designs tailored for low-cost ISAC devices.

computationally efficient, probabilistic modeling for non-Gaussian geospatial

conditional independence in representing a multivariate distribution through
factorization into a product of univariate conditionals, and is extended to a
full spatial process. We model each conditional as a mixture of spatially
varying transition kernels, with locally adaptive weights, for each one of a
given number of nearest neighbors. The modeling framework emphasizes the
description of non-Gaussian dependence at the data level, in contrast with
approaches that introduce a spatial process for transformed data, or for
functionals of the data probability distribution. Thus, it facilitates
efficient, full simulation-based inference. We study model construction and
properties analytically through specification of bivariate distributions that
define the local transition kernels, providing a general strategy for modeling
general types of non-Gaussian data. Regarding computation, the framework lays
out a new approach to handling spatial data sets, leveraging a mixture model
structure to avoid computational issues that arise from large matrix
operations. We illustrate the methodology using synthetic data examples and an
analysis of Mediterranean Sea surface temperature observations.

defense. Most suffer from high complexity or low transferability. To address
this problem, we proposed EGC2, an enhanced graph classification model with
easy graph compression. EGC2 captures the relationship between the features of
different nodes by constructing feature graphs and improving the aggregation of
the node-level representations. To achieve lower-complexity defense applied to
graph classification models, EGC2 utilizes a centrality-based edge-importance
index to compress the graphs, filtering out trivial structures and adversarial
perturbations in the input graphs, thus improving the model's robustness.
Experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed feature

power systems with high-penetration renewables. Based on big historical data, a
novel federated deep generative learning framework, called Fed-LSGAN, is
proposed by integrating federated learning and least square generative
adversarial networks (LSGANs) for renewable scenario generation. Specifically,
federated learning learns a shared global model in a central server from
renewable sites at network edges, which enables the Fed-LSGAN to generate
scenarios in a privacy-preserving manner without sacrificing the generation
quality by transferring model parameters, rather than all data. Meanwhile, the
LSGANs-based deep generative model generates scenarios that conform to the
distribution of historical data through fully capturing the spatial-temporal
characteristics of renewable powers, which leverages the least squares loss
function to improve the training stability and generation quality. The
simulation results demonstrate that the proposal manages to generate
high-quality renewable scenarios and outperforms the state-of-the-art

disorders, the electroencephalogram (EEG) based emotion recognition has
achieved significant progress due to its high precision and reliability.
However, one obstacle to practicality lies in the variability between subjects
and sessions. Although several studies have adopted domain adaptation (DA)
approaches to tackle this problem, most of them treat multiple EEG data from
different subjects and sessions together as a single source domain for
transfer, which either fails to satisfy the assumption of domain adaptation
that the source has a certain marginal distribution, or increases the
difficulty of adaptation. We therefore propose the multi-source marginal
distribution adaptation (MS-MDA) for EEG emotion recognition, which takes both
domain-invariant and domain-specific features into consideration. First, we
assume that different EEG data share the same low-level features, then we
construct independent branches for multiple EEG data source domains to adopt
one-to-one domain adaptation and extract domain-specific features. Finally, the
inference is made by multiple branches. We evaluate our method on SEED and
SEED-IV for recognizing three and four emotions, respectively. Experimental
results show that the MS-MDA outperforms the comparison methods and
state-of-the-art models in cross-session and cross-subject transfer scenarios

protocols treat each training point uniformly. Each example is propagated
forward and backward through the network the same amount of times, independent
of how much the example contributes to the learning protocol. Recent work has
proposed ways to accelerate training by deviating from this uniform treatment.
Popular methods entail up-weighting examples that contribute more to the loss
with the intuition that examples with low loss have already been learned by the
model, so their marginal value to the training procedure should be lower. This
view assumes that updating the model with high loss examples will be beneficial
to the model. However, this may not hold for noisy, real world data. In this

a fully compensated magnetic state (FCF) in a special type of Pt and Ni doped
Mn$_3$In cubic alloy. Here, oppositely aligned uncompensated moments in two
different atomic clusters sum up to zero which are responsible for the FCF
state. Our Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show the existence of
several possible ferrimagnetic configurations with the FCF as the energetically
most stable one. The microscopic origin of the large exchange bias can be
interpreted in terms of the exchange interaction between the FCF background and
the uncompensated ferrimagnetic clusters stabilized due to its negligible
energy difference with respect to the FCF phase. We utilize pulsed magnetic
field up to 60 T and 30 T static field magnetization measurements to confirm
the intrinsic nature of exchange bias in our system. Finally, our Hall effect
measurements demonstrate the importance of uncompensated noncoplanar
interfacial moments for the realization of large EB. The present finding of
gigantic exchange bias in a unique compensated ferrimagnetic system opens up a
direction for the design of novel quantum phenomena for the technological

chapter. Of particular interest for applications are problems in which where a
so-called shape functional is constrained by a partial differential equation
(PDE) describing the underlying physics. A connection can made between a
classical view of shape optimization and the differential-geometric structure
of shape spaces. To handle problems where a shape functional depends on
multiple shapes, a theoretical framework is presented, whereby the optimization
variable can be represented as a vector of shapes belonging to a product shape
space. The multi-shape gradient and multi-shape derivative are defined, which
allows for a rigorous justification of a steepest descent method with Armijo
backtracking. As long as the shapes as subsets of a hold-all domain do not
intersect, solving a single deformation equation is enough to provide descent
directions with respect to each shape. Additionally, a framework for handling
uncertainties arising from inputs or parameters in the PDE is presented. To
handle potentially high-dimensional stochastic spaces, a stochastic gradient
method is proposed. A model problem is constructed, demonstrating how
uncertainty can be introduced into the problem and the objective can be
transformed by use of the expectation. Finally, numerical experiments in the
deterministic and stochastic case are devised, which demonstrate the
effectiveness of the presented algorithms.

that the usage of the implicit Euler method as a time integrator suffices for
the Parareal algorithm to converge. Both versions of the Parareal method are
applied to numerical examples of nonlinear index 2 differential algebraic

application of dynamic analysis tools to firmware analysis. The
state-of-the-art work automatically models unknown peripherals by observing
their access patterns, and then leverages heuristics to calculate the
appropriate responses when unknown peripheral registers are accessed. However,
we empirically found that this approach and the corresponding heuristics are
frequently insufficient to emulate firmware. In this work, we propose a new
approach called uEmu to emulate firmware with unknown peripherals. Unlike
existing work that attempts to build a general model for each peripheral, our
approach learns how to correctly emulate firmware execution at individual
peripheral access points. It takes the image as input and symbolically executes
it by representing unknown peripheral registers as symbols. During symbolic
execution, it infers the rules to respond to unknown peripheral accesses. These
rules are stored in a knowledge base, which is referred to during the dynamic
firmware analysis. uEmu achieved a passing rate of 95% in a set of unit tests
for peripheral drivers without any manual assistance. We also evaluated uEmu
with real-world firmware samples and new bugs were discovered.

non-relativistic particles interacting with a pair potential
$\frac{g}{|x-y|^2}$ in one dimension, considered as a quantum field theory in
one space and one time dimension via the second quantisation. This model has
the anisotropic scale symmetry with the anisotropy exponent $z=2$. The symmetry
is also enhanced to the Schr\""odinger symmetry. The model has one coupling
constant $g$ and thus provides an example of a fixed line in the
renormalisation group flow of anisotropic theories.
  We exactly compute a nontrivial four-point function of the fundamental fields
of the theory. We decompose the four-point function via OPE in two different
ways, thereby explicitly verifying the associativity of OPE for the first time
for an interacting quantum field theory with anisotropic scale invariance. From
the decompositions, one can read off the OPE coefficients and the scaling
dimensions of the operators appearing in the intermediate channels. One of the
decompositions is given by a convergent series, and only one primary operator
and its descendants appear in the OPE. The scaling dimension of the primary
operator we computed depends on the coupling constant. The dimension correctly
reproduces the value expected from the well-known spectrum of the Calogero
model combined with the so-called state-operator map which is valid for
theories with the Schr\""odinger symmetry. The other decomposition is given by
an asymptotic series. The asymptotic series comes with exponentially small
correction terms, which also have a natural interpretation in terms of OPE.

many advantages compared to sparse retrieval. Existing dense retrievers
optimize representations of queries and documents with contrastive training and

the matched query-document pairs and pushing the negative documents away from
the query. However, in such training paradigm, the queries are only optimized
to align to the documents and are coarsely positioned, leading to an
anisotropic query embedding space. In this paper, we analyze the embedding
space distributions and propose an effective training paradigm, Contrastive
Dual Learning for Approximate Nearest Neighbor (DANCE) to learn fine-grained
query representations for dense retrieval. DANCE incorporates an additional
dual training object of query retrieval, inspired by the classic information
retrieval training axiom, query likelihood. With contrastive learning, the dual
training object of DANCE learns more tailored representations for queries and
documents to keep the embedding space smooth and uniform, thriving on the
ranking performance of DANCE on the MS MARCO document retrieval task. Different
from ANCE that only optimized with the document retrieval task, DANCE
concentrates the query embeddings closer to document representations while
making the document distribution more discriminative. Such concentrated query
embedding distribution assigns more uniform negative sampling probabilities to
queries and helps to sufficiently optimize query representations in the query
retrieval task. Our codes are released at https://github.com/thunlp/DANCE.

deposited by reactive magnetron sputtering. B doping, in combination with the
highly energetic deposition conditions offered by HiPIMS, results in the
suppression of the columnar grain morphology typically encountered in AlTiN
coatings. On the contrary, the AlTiBN coatings grown by HiPIMS present a dense
nanocomposite type microstructure, formed by nanocrystalline Ti(Al)N domains
and amorphous regions composed of Ti(Al)B2 and BN. As a result, high-Al content
(x>0.6) AlTiBN coatings grown by HiPIMS offer higher hardness, elasticity and
fracture toughness than AlTiN coatings. Moreover, the thermal stability and the
hot hardness are substantially enhanced, delaying the onset of formation of the
detrimental hexagonal AlN phase from 850 C in the case of AlTiN, to 1000 C in
the case of AlTiBN.

to deduce a modified Friedmann equation in the reduced theory. Requiring that

a simple extension of existing optimization frameworks [112] for geodesics and

curves into a data structure that, given a query curve $q$ with $k$ vertices,
either returns an input curve with Fr\'echet distance at most $c\cdot \delta$
to $q$, or returns that there exists no input curve with Fr\'echet distance at
most $\delta$ to $q$. We focus on the case where the input and the queries are
one-dimensional polygonal curves -- also called time series -- and we give a
comprehensive analysis for this case. We obtain new upper bounds that provide
different tradeoffs between approximation factor, preprocessing time, and query
time.
  Our data structures improve upon the state of the art in several ways. We
show that for any $0 < \varepsilon \leq 1$ an approximation factor of
$(1+\varepsilon)$ can be achieved within the same asymptotic time bounds as the
previously best result for $(2+\varepsilon)$. Moreover, we show that an
approximation factor of $(2+\varepsilon)$ can be obtained by using
preprocessing time and space $O(nm)$, which is linear in the input size, and
query time in $O(\frac{1}{\varepsilon})^{k+2}$, where the previously best
result used preprocessing time in $n \cdot O(\frac{m}{\varepsilon k})^k$ and
query time in $O(1)^k$. We complement our upper bounds with matching
conditional lower bounds based on the Orthogonal Vectors Hypothesis.
Interestingly, some of our lower bounds already hold for any super-constant
value of $k$. This is achieved by proving hardness of a one-sided sparse
version of the Orthogonal Vectors problem as an intermediate problem, which we
believe to be of independent interest.

perovskites is needed both for gauging metal-insulator transitions, as well as
their application in catalysis and doping. The magnitude of this band gap is
rather different for different magnetic spin configurations. We find via
electronic structure theory that the factors that connect gapping magnitudes to
magnetism depend on the nature of the band edge orbital character (BEOC) and
surprisingly scale with the number of antiferromagnetic contacts z$_i$ between
neighboring transition metal ions. The dependence is weak when the BEOC are
(d,d)-like (""Mott insulators""), whereas this dependence is rather strong in
(p,d)-like (""charge transfer"" insulators). These unexpected rules are traced to
the reduced orbital interactions through the increase in the number of
antiferromagnetic contacts between transition metal ions. The impact of
magnetic order is not limited to the band gap magnitude and includes also the
magnitude of lattice distortions connected to the electronic structure. These
results highlight the importance of establishing in electronic structure theory
of gap-related phenomena (doping, transport, metal-insulator transitions,
conductive interfaces) the appropriate magnetic order.

(LXe) detectors for Dark Matter (DM) searches in the 50-ton range. To avoid an
impractically long, single drift space of a dual-phase detector, it seems
beneficial to use the single-phase technique. Since electrons then can drift in
any direction, we can segment the homogeneous medium and thus avoid an
excessive maximum drift path of order 4 m. The shorter detector length has
several benefits, e.g. requiring a lower cathode voltage for the same drift
field. We can easily split the TPC into two regions with the cathode in the
center and two anodes at the top and bottom. One also can use multiple TPCs
stacked on top of each other in the same liquid volume to reduce the maximum
drift length even further.
  A further division of the drift space by installing an additional anode in
the center would require S2 photons to traverse the liquid for several times
the Rayleigh scattering length in LXe, which is only 30 - 40 cm. This seems to
be excessive for good x - y localization. We therefore suggest a geometry of
two independent TPCs with two drift spaces each.
  Despite earlier publications concerns persisted about the effect of
shadowing. A detailed FEM model of the anode regions shows that with an aligned
wire arrangement the drifting electrons impinge sideways on the anode in a
narrow angular range of width 15$^{\circ}$ - 20$^{\circ}$. Most S2 photons are
emitted in full view of the close-by PMT array. About 37% of the S2 photons are
shadowed by the anode wire out of which 30\% will be reflected back again on
the gold plating of the wires. Thus we can observe 74% of the total S2 light.
Compared to a dual-phase detector, however, we do not suffer from the
extraction efficiency, sometimes reported as low as 50%.

a required processing time are to be feasibly scheduled in a single- or

energy is consumed but also no processing can take place, and an \emph{active
state} which consumes energy at a rate of one, and in which jobs can be
processed. Transitioning from the active to the sleep does not incur any
further energy cost, but transitioning from the sleep to the active state
requires $q$ energy units. Jobs may be preempted and (in the multi-processor
case) migrated.
  The single-processor case of the problem is known to be solvable in
polynomial time via an involved dynamic program, whereas the only known
approximation algorithm for the multi-processor case attains an approximation
factor of $3$ and is based on rounding the solution to a linear programming
relaxation of the problem. In this work, we present efficient and combinatorial
approximation algorithms for both the single- and the multi-processor setting.
Before, only an algorithm based on linear programming was known for the
multi-processor case. Our algorithms build upon the concept of a
\emph{skeleton}, a basic (and not necessarily feasible) schedule that captures
the fact that some processor(s) must be active at some time point during an
interval. Finally, we further demonstrate the power of skeletons by providing
an $2$-approximation algorithm for the multiprocessor case, thus improving upon
the recent breakthrough $3$-approximation result. Our algorithm is based on a

modulation of an incident radio-frequency (RF) wave, has emerged as a
cutting-edge technological paradigm for self-sustainable Internet-of-things
(IoT). Nevertheless, the contemporary BackCom systems are limited to
short-range and low data rate applications only, thus rendering them
insufficient on their own to support pervasive connectivity among the massive
number of IoT devices. Meanwhile, wireless networks are rapidly evolving
towards the smart radio paradigm. In this regard, reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (RISs) have come to the forefront to transform the wireless
propagation environment into a fully controllable and customizable space in a
cost-effective and energy-efficient manner. Targeting the sixth-generation (6G)
horizon, we anticipate the integration of RISs into BackCom systems as a new
frontier for enabling 6G IoT networks. In this article, for the first time in
the open literature, we provide a tutorial overview of RIS-assisted BackCom
(RIS-BackCom) systems. Specifically, we introduce the four different variants
of RIS-BackCom and identify the potential improvements that can be achieved by
incorporating RISs into BackCom systems. In addition, owing to the unrivaled
effectiveness of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), we present a case study
on an RIS-assisted NOMA-enhanced BackCom system. Finally, we outline the way
forward for translating this disruptive concept into real-world applications.

elements -- Mg, Al, Si, and S. These are the first measurements of absolute
abundances during such small flares and this study offers a unique insight into
the evolution of absolute abundances as the flares evolve. Our results
demonstrate that the abundances of these four elements decrease towards their
photospheric values during the peak phase of the flares. During the decay
phase, the abundances are observed to quickly return to their pre-flare coronal

with the standard flare model, suggesting the injection of fresh material into

Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), obtained at regular time epochs. One of the
useful geophysical features of a river sub-basin is that of a roughness measure
on DEMs. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not much literature
available on theoretical analysis of roughness measures. In this article, we
revisit the roughness measure on DEM data adapted from multiscale
granulometries in mathematical morphology, namely multiscale directional
granulometric index (MDGI). This measure was classically used to obtain
shape-size analysis in greyscale images. In earlier works, MDGIs were
introduced to capture the characteristic surficial roughness of a river
sub-basin along specific directions. Also, MDGIs can be efficiently computed
and are known to be useful features for classification of river sub-basins. In
this article, we provide a theoretical analysis of a MDGI. In particular, we
characterize non-trivial sufficient conditions on the structure of DEMs under
which MDGIs are invariant. These properties are illustrated with some
fictitious DEMs. We also provide connections to a discrete derivative of volume
of a DEM. Based on these connections, we provide intuition as to why a MDGI is
considered a roughness measure. Further, we experimentally illustrate on
Lower-Indus, Wardha, and Barmer river sub-basins that the proposed features
capture the characteristics of the river sub-basin.

of tasks $T$ are allowed to grow with $n$. In the high-dimensional regime
$p\ggg n$, in order to leverage row-sparsity, the MT Lasso is considered.
  We build upon the MT Lasso with a de-biasing scheme to correct for the bias
induced by the penalty. This scheme requires the introduction of a new
data-driven object, coined the interaction matrix, that captures effective
correlations between noise vector and residuals on different tasks. This matrix
is psd, of size $T\times T$ and can be computed efficiently.
  The interaction matrix lets us derive asymptotic normal and $\chi^2_T$

corresponds to consistency in Frobenius norm. These asymptotic distribution
results yield valid confidence intervals for single entries of $B^*$ and valid

regression require row-sparsity $s\lesssim\sqrt n$ up to constants depending on

adaptive cruise control (ACC) models used to simulate measured driving
behaviour of commercial ACCs. To this aim, a general modelling framework is
proposed, in which ACC and CF models have been incrementally augmented with
physics extensions; namely, perception delay, linear or nonlinear vehicle
dynamics, and acceleration constraints. The framework has been applied to the
Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), the Gipps model, and to three basic ACCs. These
are a linear controller coupled with a constant time-headway spacing policy and
with two other policies derived from the traffic flow theory, which are the IDM
desired-distance function and the Gipps equilibrium distance-speed function.
The ninety models resulting from the combination of the five base models and
the aforementioned physics extensions, have been assessed and compared through
a vast calibration and validation experiment against measured trajectory data
of low-level automated vehicles. When a single extension has been applied,
perception delay and linear dynamics have been the extensions to mostly
increase modelling accuracy, whatsoever the base model considered. Concerning
models, Gipps-based ones have outperformed all other CF and ACC models in
calibration. Even among ACCs, the linear controllers coupled with a Gipps
spacing policy have been the best performing. On the other hand, IDM-based
models have been by far the most robust in validation, showing almost no crash
when calibrated parameters have been used to simulate different trajectories.
Overall, the paper shows the importance of cross-fertilization between traffic
flow and vehicle studies.

to align adjacent frames to the reference frame; how to restore the reference

optical flow, deformable convolution, 3D convolution) to align neighboring
frames with the reference frame in feature space or image space, they then use
various restoration methods to achieve the final dehazing results. In this
paper, we propose a progressive alignment and restoration method for video
dehazing. The alignment process aligns consecutive neighboring frames stage by
stage without using the optical flow estimation. The restoration process is not
only implemented under the alignment process but also uses a refinement network
to improve the dehazing performance of the whole network. The proposed networks
include four fusion networks and one refinement network. To decrease the

All known two-pass streaming algorithms for MBM operate in a similar fashion:
They compute a maximal matching in the first pass and find 3-augmenting paths
in the second in order to augment the matching found in the first pass. Our aim
is to explore the limitations of this approach and to determine whether current
techniques can be used to further improve the state-of-the-art algorithms. We
give the following results:
  We show that every two-pass streaming algorithm that solely computes a
maximal matching in the first pass and outputs a $(2/3+\epsilon)$-approximation
requires $n^{1+\Omega(\frac{1}{\log \log n})}$ space, for every $\epsilon > 0$,
where $n$ is the number of vertices of the input graph. This result is obtained
by extending the Ruzsa-Szemer\'{e}di graph construction of [GKK, SODA'12] so as
to ensure that the resulting graph has a close to perfect matching, the key
property needed in our construction. This result may be of independent
interest.
  Furthermore, we combine the two main techniques, i.e., subsampling followed
by the Greedy matching algorithm [Konrad, MFCS'18] which gives a $2-\sqrt{2}
\approx 0.5857$-approximation, and the computation of \emph{degree-bounded
semi-matchings} [EHM, ICDMW'16][KT, APPROX'17] which gives a $\frac{1}{2} +
\frac{1}{12} \approx 0.5833$-approximation, and obtain a meta-algorithm that
yields Konrad's and Esfandiari et al.'s algorithms as special cases. This
unifies two strands of research. By optimizing parameters, we discover that
Konrad's algorithm is optimal for the implied class of algorithms and, perhaps
surprisingly, that there is a second optimal algorithm. We show that the
analysis of our meta-algorithm is best possible. Our results imply that further
improvements, if possible, require new techniques.

a series of experiments, we show how eight modules can be quickly learned and
added to a base control module to obtain emergent adaptive behaviors allowing a
hexapod robot to navigate in complex environments. We also show that modules

GaP$_{1-x}$N$_{x}$ was systematically investigated as a function of the growth
temperature and the fluxes of the N and P precursors, 1,1-dimethylhydrazine

fraction exhibits an Arrhenius behavior characterized by an apparent activation
energy of $(0.79\pm 0.05)$ eV. With respect to the fluxes, we determined that
the N mole fraction is linearly proportional to the flux of DMHy, and inversely
proportional to the one of TBP. All results are summarized in an universal
equation that describes the dependence of \textit{x} on the growth temperature
and the fluxes of the group-V precursors. The results are further illustrated

three-dimensional flow and the influence of corrugation geometry on pressure
drop and convective heat transfer. With water as working fluid and an imposed
wall heat flux, ranging from around 4 to 33 kW/m2, a numerical model was
developed with a CFD commercial software, where k-omega SST was used to model
turbulence. Experimental tests were performed covering Reynolds numbers in the
range from around 300 up to 5000, which allowed to identify the transition
region and validate the numerical model. The results show that due to the swirl
induced by the corrugation, the critical Reynolds number for the start of
transition to turbulent flow is reduced. The thermal performance factor, which
quantifies the heat transfer enhancement at the expense of pressure drop, was
used to compare the corrugated tubes against the reference case of smooth tube.
Based on this, all investigated corrugated geometries performed better than the
smooth tube, except for low Reynolds numbers (Re<500) in the laminar regime.
Overall, the corrugated tube with the lowest pitch showed a clearly better
performance for the intermediate range of Reynolds numbers (1000<Re<2300),
being an optimal choice for a wider range of operating conditions in the

atmospheric, and opacity models we were not able to confirm the two former
detections of point sources performed in the L band. In addition, the analysis
of the spiral arms from a dynamical point of view does not support the
hypothesis that these candidates comprise the origin of the spirals.
Conclusions. Deeper observations and longer timescales will be required to
identify the actual source of the spiral arms in MWC 758.

do it naturally, even unconsciously. For instance, with a baby seat on the
rear, the driver might leave more space on one side to be able to get the baby
out easily; or when grocery shopping, s/he may position the vehicle to remain
the trunk accessible. Autonomous vehicles are becoming technically effective at
driving from A to B and parking in a proper spot, with a default way. However,
in order to satisfy users' expectations and to become trustworthy, they will
also need to park or make a temporary stop, appropriate to the given situation.
In addition, users want to understand better the capabilities of their driving
assistance features, such as automated parking systems. A voice-based interface
can help with this and even ease the adoption of these features. Therefore, we
developed a voice-based in-car assistant (Park4U Mate), that is aware of
interior and exterior contexts (thanks to a variety of sensors), and that is
able to park autonomously in a smart way (with a constraints minimization
strategy). The solution was demonstrated to thirty-five users in test-drives
and their feedback was collected on the system's decision-making capability as
well as on the human-machine-interaction. The results show that: (1) the
proposed optimization algorithm is efficient at deciding the best parking
strategy; hence, autonomous vehicles can adopt it; (2) a voice-based digital
assistant for autonomous parking is perceived as a clear and effective
interaction method. However, the interaction speed remained the most important
criterion for users. In addition, they clearly wish not to be limited on only
voice-interaction, to use the automated parking function and rather appreciate
a multi-modal interaction.

inter-cluster tasks (e.g., identifying cluster relationships in the original

two aspects of the inter-cluster reliability: Steadiness measures the extent to

Cohesiveness measures the opposite. They extract random clusters with arbitrary

stretched or dispersed in the other space. Furthermore, our metrics can
quantify pointwise distortions, allowing for the visualization of inter-cluster
reliability in a projection, which we call a reliability map. Through
quantitative experiments, we verify that our metrics precisely capture the
distortions that harm inter-cluster reliability while previous metrics have
difficulty capturing the distortions. A case study also demonstrates that our

widely used in medicine and engineering to measure the velocity field of a
fluid. These measurements are dense but have a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
The measurements can be de-noised by imposing physical constraints on the flow,
which are encapsulated in governing equations for mass and momentum. Previous
studies have required the shape of the boundary (for example, a blood vessel)
to be known a priori. This, however, requires a set of additional measurements,
which can be expensive to obtain. In this paper, we present a physics-informed
neural network that instead uses the noisy MRV data alone to simultaneously
infer the most likely boundary shape and de-noised velocity field. We achieve
this by training an auxiliary neural network that takes the value 1.0 within
the inferred domain of the governing PDE and 0.0 outside. This network is used
to weight the PDE residual term in the loss function accordingly and implicitly
learns the geometry of the system. We test our algorithm by assimilating both
synthetic and real MRV measurements for flows that can be well modeled by the
Poisson and Stokes equations. We find that we are able to reconstruct very
noisy (SNR = 2.5) MRV signals and recover the ground truth with low
reconstruction errors of 3.7 - 7.5%. The simplicity and flexibility of our
physics-informed neural network approach can readily scale to assimilating MRV
data with complex 3D geometries, time-varying 4D data, or unknown parameters in
the physical model.

decide whether to accept or decline ride requests assigned by the ride-hailing
platform. Drivers' ride acceptance behaviour can significantly influence system
performance in terms of riders' waiting time (associated with the level of
service), drivers' occupation rate and idle time (related to drivers' income),
and platform revenue and reputation. Hence, it is of great importance to
identify the underlying determinants of the ride acceptance behaviour of
drivers. To this end, we collected a unique dataset from ride-sourcing drivers
working in the United States and the Netherlands through a cross-sectional
stated preference experiment designed based upon disparate information conveyed
to the respondents. Using a choice modelling approach, we estimated the effects
of various existing and hypothetical attributes influencing the ride acceptance
choice. Employment status, experience level with the platform, and working
shift are found to be the key individual-specific determinants. Part-time and
beginning drivers who work on midweek days (Monday-Thursday) have a higher
tendency to accept ride offers. Results also reveal that pickup time, which is
the travel time between the driver's location and the rider's waiting spot, has
a negative impact on ride acceptance. Moreover, the findings suggest that a
guaranteed tip (i.e., the minimum amount of tip that is indicated upfront by
the prospective rider, a feature that is currently not available) and an
additional income due to surge pricing are valued noticeably higher than trip
fare. The provided insights can be used to develop customised matching and

follow marked Markoian arrival process (MMAP) and PH distribution with distinct
parameters, re-spectively. An arriving new call will be blocked when all the
channels are occupied, and consequently will join the orbit (virtual space) of
infinite capacity to retry following PH distribution. When all the channels are
occupied and a handoff call arrives at the system, out of the following two
scenarios, one might take place. In the first scenario, if all the channels are
occupied with handoff calls, the arriving handoff call will be lost from the
system. While in the second one, if all the channels are occupied and at least

new paradigm for solving problems relating to differential equations. Compared
to classical numerical methods PINNs have several advantages, for example their
ability to provide mesh-free solutions of differential equations and their
ability to carry out forward and inverse modelling within the same optimisation
problem. Whilst promising, a key limitation to date is that PINNs have
struggled to accurately and efficiently solve problems with large domains
and/or multi-scale solutions, which is crucial for their real-world
application. Multiple significant and related factors contribute to this issue,
including the increasing complexity of the underlying PINN optimisation problem
as the problem size grows and the spectral bias of neural networks. In this
work we propose a new, scalable approach for solving large problems relating to
differential equations called Finite Basis PINNs (FBPINNs). FBPINNs are
inspired by classical finite element methods, where the solution of the
differential equation is expressed as the sum of a finite set of basis
functions with compact support. In FBPINNs neural networks are used to learn
these basis functions, which are defined over small, overlapping subdomains.
FBINNs are designed to address the spectral bias of neural networks by using
separate input normalisation over each subdomain, and reduce the complexity of
the underlying optimisation problem by using many smaller neural networks in a
parallel divide-and-conquer approach. Our numerical experiments show that
FBPINNs are effective in solving both small and larger, multi-scale problems,
outperforming standard PINNs in both accuracy and computational resources
required, potentially paving the way to the application of PINNs on large,
real-world problems.

be confirmed with a single snapshot measurement of the polarization qubit
performed at unknown time and even with unknown coupling. We also show how the

backgrounds in the FUV and X-ray bands that affect the formation of Population
III stars. Using a grid of cosmological hydrodynamics zoom-in simulations, we
explore the impact of the Lyman-Warner (LW) and X-ray radiation backgrounds on
the critical dark matter halo mass for Population III star formation and the
total mass in stars per halo. We find that the LW radiation background lowers
the H$_2$ fraction and delays the formation of the Population III stars. On the
other hand, X-ray irradiation anticipates the redshift of collapse and reduces
the critical halo mass, unless the X-ray background is too strong and gas
heating shuts down gas collapse into the halos and prevents star formation.
Therefore, an X-ray background can increase the number of dark matter halos
forming Population III stars by about a factor of ten, but the total mass in
stars forming in each halo is reduced. This is because X-ray radiation
increases the molecular fraction and lowers the minimum temperature of the
collapsing gas (or equivalently the mass of the quasi-hydrostatic core) and
therefore slows down the accretion of the gas onto the central protostar.

entry of $A$, and then compute the matrix decomposition, but this requires
storing all of $A$ as well as multiple passes over its entries. Recent work of
Liang et al.\ shows how to find a rank-$k$ factorization to $f(A)$ for an $n

over the entries of $A$. The authors pose the open question of obtaining an
algorithm with $n \cdot \operatorname{poly}(\epsilon^{-1}k\log n)$ words of
memory using only a single pass over the entries of $A$. In this paper we
resolve this open question, obtaining the first single-pass algorithm for this
problem and for the same class of functions $f$ studied by Liang et al.
Moreover, our error is $\|f(A)-[f(A)]_k\|_F^2 + \operatorname{poly}(\epsilon/k)
\|f(A)\|_F^2$, where $\|f(A)\|_F^2$ is the sum of squares of Euclidean lengths
of rows of $f(A)$. Thus our error is significantly smaller, as it removes the
factor of $10$ and also $\|f(A)\|_F^2 \leq \|f(A)\|_{1,2}^2$. We also give an
algorithm for regression, pointing out an error in previous work, and

scattering (VBS) within the non-linear effective field theory given by the

computation is performed in the most general case of covariant $R_\xi$ gauges
and is compared through all this work with the Standard Model case, whose
computation in these covariant gauges is also novel and is presented also here.
The calculation of the one-loop VBS amplitude is performed using the
diagrammatic method by means of the one-particle-irreducible (1PI) Green
functions that are involved in these scattering processes. The central part of
this work is then devoted to the renormalization of all the n-legs one-loop 1PI
Green functions involved. This renormalization is performed in the most general
off-shell case with arbitrary external legs momenta. We then describe in full
detail the renormalization program, which within this context of the EChL,
implies to derive all the counterterms for both the electroweak parameters,
like boson masses and gauge couplings, and those for the EChL coefficients.
These later are crucial for the renormalization of the new divergences
typically appearing when computing loops with the lowest chiral dimension
Lagrangian. We present here the full list of involved divergences and
counterterms in the $R_\xi$ gauges and derive the complete set of
renormalization group equations for the EChL coefficients. In the last part of

we do not see improvement in total energies in comparison to the coupled

performance of GFCC as an impurity solver with a series of transition metal
oxides. These studies shed light on strength and weaknesses of such a solver
and demonstrate that such a solver gives very accurate results when the size of
the impurity is small. We investigate if it is possible to achieve a systematic
accuracy of the embedding solution when we increase the size of the impurity
problem. We found that in such a case, the performance of the solver worsens,
both in terms of finding the ground state solution of the impurity problem as
well as the self-energies produced. We concluded that increasing the rank of
GFCC solver is necessary to be able to enlarge impurity problems and achieve a
reliable accuracy. We also have shown that natural orbitals from weakly

When Eulerian data are unavailable, they may be employed to estimate flow
fields or to identify coherent flow structures. Here we numerically examine the
possibility of using particles to capture the dynamics of isolated vortex rings
propagating in a quiescent fluid. The analysis is performed starting from
numerical simulations of the Navier--Stokes and the
Hall--Vinen--Bekarevich--Khalatnikov equations, respectively describing the
dynamics of a Newtonian fluid and a finite-temperature superfluid. The
flow-induced positions and velocities of particles suspended in the fluid are
specifically used to compute the Lagrangian pseudovorticity field, a proxy for
the Eulerian vorticity field recently employed in the context of superfluid
$^4$He experiments. We show that, when calculated from ideal Lagrangian tracers
or from particles with low inertia, the pseudovorticity field can be accurately
used to estimate the propagation velocity and the growth of isolated vortex
rings, although the quantitative reconstruction of the corresponding vorticity
fields remains challenging. On the other hand, particles with high inertia tend
to preferentially sample specific flow regions, resulting in biased
pseudovorticity fields that pollute the estimation of the vortex ring
properties. Overall, this work neatly demonstrates that the Lagrangian
pseudovorticity is a valuable tool for estimating the strength of macroscopic
vortical structures in the absence of Eulerian data, which is, for example, the
case of superfluid $^4$He experiments.

values (positive/negative). The bimodal distributions for the coupling
strengths and frequencies are either correlated or uncorrelated. To study how
correlation affects phase coherence, we analyzed the TFTC model by means of
numerical simulations and exact dimensional reduction methods allowing to study
the collective dynamics in terms of local order parameters. The competition
resulting from distributed coupling strengths and natural frequencies produces
nontrivial dynamic states. For correlated disorder in frequencies and coupling
strengths, we found that the entire oscillator population splits into two
subpopulations, both phase-locked (Lock-Lock) or one phase-locked, and the
other drifting (Lock-Drift), where the mean-fields of the sub-populations
maintain a constant non-zero phase difference. For uncorrelated disorder, we
found that the oscillator population may split into four phase-locked
subpopulations, forming phase-locked pairs which are either mutually
frequency-locked (Stable Lock-Lock-Lock-Lock) or drifting (Breathing
Lock-Lock-Lock-Lock), thus resulting in a periodic motion of the global
synchronization level. Finally, we found for both types of disorder that a
state of Incoherence exists; however, for correlated coupling strengths and
frequencies, incoherence is always unstable, whereas it is only neutrally
stable for the uncorrelated case. Numerical simulations performed on the model
show good agreement with the analytic predictions. The simplicity of the model
promises that real-world systems can be found which display the dynamics

irradiated discs undergo fewer fragmentations and typically produce either
binary systems or low-multiplicity systems. In contrast, the cases with weak or
no X-ray irradiation produce systems with a typical multiplicity of $6 \pm 3$.
In addition, the most massive protostar in each system is smaller by roughly a
factor of two when the disc is irradiated by X-rays, due to lower accretion
rate. With these two effects combined, the initial mass function of fragments
becomes more top-heavy in a strong X-ray background and is well described by a
power-law with slope $1.53$ and high-mass cutoff of $61$ M$_\odot$. Without
X-rays, we find a slope $0.49$ and cutoff mass of $229$ M$_\odot$. Finally,
protostars migrate outward after their formation due to the accretion of
high-angular momentum gas from outside and the migration is more frequent and
significant in absence of X-ray irradiation.

Catalan corpus (CaText), the largest to date (but only a fraction of the usual
size of the previous work in monolingual language models), (2) train a
Transformer-based language model for Catalan (BERTa), and (3) devise a thorough

downstream tasks, namely, Part of Speech Tagging, Named Entity Recognition and

small object. It was first observed using stellar occultation in 2013. Stellar
occultations allow the determination of sizes and shapes with kilometre
accuracy and obtain characteristics of the occulting object and its vicinity.
Using stellar occultations observed between 2017 and 2020, we aim at
constraining Chariklo's and its rings physical parameters. We also determine
the rings' structure, and obtain precise astrometrical positions of Chariklo.
We predicted and organised several observational campaigns of stellar
occultations by Chariklo. Occultation light curves were measured from the data
sets, from which ingress and egress times, and rings' width and opacity were
obtained. These measurements, combined with results from previous works, allow
us to obtain significant constraints on Chariklo's shape and rings' structure.
We characterise Chariklo's ring system (C1R and C2R), and obtain radii and pole
orientations that are consistent with, but more accurate than, results from
previous occultations. We confirmed the detection of W-shaped structures within
C1R and an evident variation of radial width. The observed width ranges between
4.8 and 9.1 km with a mean value of 6.5 km. One dual observation (visible and
red) does not reveal any differences in the C1R opacity profiles, indicating
ring particle's size larger than a few microns. The C1R ring eccentricity is
found to be smaller than 0.022 (3-sigma), and its width variations may indicate
an eccentricity higher than 0.005. We fit a tri-axial shape to Chariklo's
detections over eleven occultations and determine that Chariklo is consistent
with an ellipsoid with semi-axes of 143.8, 135.2 and 99.1 km. Ultimately, we
provided seven astrometric positions at a milliarcseconds accuracy level, based
on Gaia EDR3, and use it to improve Chariklo's ephemeris.

advantage of the feature extraction and mapping power of deep convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) and uses a lightness prior to modulate the CNN to better
exploit observations in the surrounding areas of the over-exposed regions to
enhance the quality of HDR image reconstruction. Specifically, we introduce a
Hierarchical Synthesis Network (HiSN) for inferring a HDR image from a LDR
input and a Lightness Adpative Modulation Network (LAMN) to incorporate the the
lightness prior knowledge in the inferring process. The HiSN hierarchically
synthesizes the high-brightness component and the low-brightness component of
the HDR image whilst the LAMN uses a lightness adaptive mask that separates
detail-less saturated bright pixels from well-exposed lower light pixels to
enable HiSN to better infer the missing information, particularly in the
difficult over-exposed detail-less areas. We present experimental results to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the new technique based on quantitative
measures and visual comparisons. In addition, we present ablation studies of
HiSN and visualization of the activation maps inside LAMN to help gain a deeper
understanding of the internal working of the new iTM algorithm and explain why
it can achieve much improved performance over state-of-the-art algorithms.

There are myriad types of time including cosmological time, biological time,

My brief essay concerns time in physics and I hope that the pragmatism of an
experimental physicist might help provide a perspective that is often absent in
treatises by contemporary philosophers and physicists. This is especially the
case for the notion of the arrow of time. The paradox of the arrow of time
arises because the laws of physics are invariably time reversal invariant, in
which case we are led to ask what determines the direction of time.
Investigations of time's arrow are usually framed in the context of a
mathematical formalism where the parameter t represents time, and then proceed
to logical analyses of how the direction of time emerges. The implicit
assumption is that time is an ontological property of nature. On the other
hand, for an empiricist like me, it is absolutely crucial to frame any such
discussion in terms of direct human experience and not on a parameter in a
mathematical model. This, in short, is the motivation for my essay and I
conclude that the paradox of the arrow of time is an artificial problem that

fermions coupled to a metric and a gauge potential. While in the
non-perturbative case the trace anomaly is the response of the effective action
to a Weyl transformation, the definition in a perturbative approach is more
involved. In the latter case we use a specific formula proposed by M.Duff, of
which we present a physical interpretation. The main body of the paper consists
in deriving trace anomalies with the above formula and comparing them with the
corresponding non-perturbative results. We show that they coincide and stress
the basic role of diffeomorphism invariance for the validity of the approach.

several tasks. Nonetheless, it may result in significant discrimination if not
handled properly as CV systems highly depend on the data they are fed with and
can learn and amplify biases within such data. Thus, the problems of
understanding and discovering biases are of utmost importance. Yet, there is no
comprehensive survey on bias in visual datasets. Hence, this work aims to: i)
describe the biases that might manifest in visual datasets; ii) review the
literature on methods for bias discovery and quantification in visual datasets;
iii) discuss existing attempts to collect bias-aware visual datasets. A key
conclusion of our study is that the problem of bias discovery and
quantification in visual datasets is still open, and there is room for
improvement in terms of both methods and the range of biases that can be
addressed. Moreover, there is no such thing as a bias-free dataset, so
scientists and practitioners must become aware of the biases in their datasets
and make them explicit. To this end, we propose a checklist to spot different
types of bias during visual dataset collection.

the increasing demand of strict cooperation between humans and robots, since it
equips a general multi-robot cell with the feature of making robots and human

index which depends both on the relative position and velocity of the human

Processing (NLP) models is necessary to build and maintain customer trust.
Differential Privacy (DP) has emerged as the most successful method to protect
the privacy of individuals. However, applying DP to the NLP domain comes with
unique challenges. The most successful previous methods use a generalization of
DP for metric spaces, and apply the privatization by adding noise to inputs in
the metric space of word embeddings. However, these methods assume that one
specific distance measure is being used, ignore the density of the space around
the input, and assume the embeddings used have been trained on non-sensitive

  In this work we propose Truncated Exponential Mechanism (TEM), a general
method that allows the privatization of words using any distance metric, on
embeddings that can be trained on sensitive data. Our method makes use of the
exponential mechanism to turn the privatization step into a \emph{selection
problem}. This allows the noise applied to be calibrated to the density of the
embedding space around the input, and makes domain adaptation possible for the
embeddings. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of utility for the same level of

triadic interaction equations between helical modes, we show by numerical
integration that the maximum growth rate of the TRI is found for secondary
waves that do not propagate in the same vertical plane as the primary wave (the
rotation axis is parallel to the vertical). In the inviscid limit, we prove
this result analytically, in which case the change in the horizontal
propagation direction induced by the TRI evolves from $60^\circ$ to $90^\circ$
depending on the frequency of the primary wave. Thanks to a wave generator with
a large spatial extension in the horizontal direction of invariance of the
forced wave, we are able to report experimental evidence that the TRI of a
plane inertial wave is three-dimensional. The wavevectors of the secondary

precession and THz nutation resonance frequencies are calculated. Our results
show that the precession resonance frequencies and effective damping decrease
with intra-sublattice nutation coupling, while they increase with inter
-sublattice nutation in an antiferromagnet. However, we find that the THz
nutation resonance frequencies decrease with both the intra-and
inter-sublattice nutation couplings. For ferrimagnets, conversely, we calculate
two nutation modes with distinct frequencies, unlike antiferromagnets. The
exchange-like precession resonance frequency of ferrimagnets decreases with
intra-sublattice nutation coupling and increases with inter-sublattice nutation
coupling, like antiferromagnets, but the ferromagnetic-like precession
frequency of ferrimagnets is practically invariant to the intra and
inter-sublattice nutation couplings.

that, in order to avoid double counting of soft contributions, one should use

zero-bin subtractions in the terminology of soft-collinear effective theory. We
show that they can be factored from the radiative jet function and that the
resulting soft-subtraction function gives rise to a nonlocal renormalization of
the subtracted radiative jet function. This is a novel instance in which
zero-bin subtractions lead to a nonlocality in the renormalization of a
subtracted quantity that is not present in the renormalization of the
unsubtracted quantity. We demonstrate the use of our formalism by computing the
order-$\alpha_s$ evolution kernel for the subtracted radiative jet function.
Our result is in agreement with the result that had been inferred previously by
making use of the factorization theorem for $B\to \gamma\ell\nu$, but that had

Our approach can accommodate a possibly large number of either discrete or

appropriately modified outcome variable, which takes the form of the difference
between the original outcome and a function of the covariates. We characterize
the function that leads to the estimator with the smallest asymptotic variance,

one exploratory (N = 192) and one confirmatory study (N = 290) with software

theory to evaluate whether and how specific activities are associated with
software engineers' satisfaction and productivity. To explore the subject
domain, we first ran a two-wave longitudinal study. We found that the time
software engineers spent on specific activities (e.g., coding, bugfixing,
helping others) while working from home was similar to pre-pandemic times.
Also, the amount of time developers spent on each activity was unrelated to
their general well-being, perceived productivity, and other variables such as
basic needs. Our confirmatory study found that activity-specific variables
(e.g., how much autonomy software engineers had during coding) do predict
activity satisfaction and productivity but not by activity-independent
variables such as general resilience or a good work-life balance.
Interestingly, we found that satisfaction and autonomy were significantly
higher when software engineers were helping others and lower when they were
bugfixing. Finally, we discuss implications for software engineers, management,
and researchers. In particular, active company policies to support developers'
need for autonomy, relatedness, and competence appear particularly effective in

large linear systems with a particular saddle-point structure. Indeed, when the
system matrix is symmetric, but indefinite, the variational convergence theory
that is usually used to prove multigrid convergence cannot be directly applied.
However, different algebraic approaches analyze properly preconditioned
saddle-point problems, proving convergence of the Two-Grid method. In
particular, this is efficient when the blocks of the coefficient matrix possess
a Toeplitz or circulant structure. Indeed, it is possible to derive sufficient
conditions for convergence and provide optimal parameters for the
preconditioning of the saddle-point problem in terms of the associated
generating symbols. In this paper, we propose a symbol-based convergence
analysis for problems that have a hidden block Toeplitz structure. Then, they
can be investigated focusing on the properties of the associated generating
function f, which consequently is a matrix-valued function with dimension
depending on the block size of the problem. As numerical tests we focus on the
matrix sequence stemming from the finite element approximation of the Stokes
problem. We show the efficiency of the methods studying the hidden 9-by-9 block
multilevel structure of the obtained matrix sequence. Moreover, we propose an
efficient algebraic multigrid method with convergence rate independent of the

research question. A popular hypothesis states that the so-called infodemic has

stresses that exposure to vast amounts of even contradictory information has
little effect on personal choices. The COVID-19 pandemic offered an opportunity
to investigate this relationship, analysing the interplay between COVID-19
related information circulation and the propensity of users to get vaccinated.
We analyse the vaccine infodemics on Twitter and Facebook by looking at 146M
contents produced by 20M accounts between 1 January 2020 and 30 April 2021. We
find that vaccine-related news triggered huge interest through social media,
affecting attention patterns and the modality in which information was
spreading. However, we observe that such a tumultuous information landscape
translated only in minimal variations in overall vaccine acceptance as measured
by Facebook's daily COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (previously known as

observation period includes the European Medicines Agency (EMA) investigations
over blood clots cases potentially related to vaccinations, a series of events
that could have eroded trust in vaccination campaigns. We conclude the paper by
investigating the numerical correlation between various infodemics indices and
vaccine acceptance, observing strong compatibility with a null model. This
finding supports the hypothesis that altered information consumption patterns
are not a reliable predictor of collective behavioural change. Instead, wider
attention on social media seems to resolve in polarisation, with the
vaccine-prone and the vaccine-hesitant maintaining their positions.

(SNe) explosions affect the star formation history and the chemical properties
of second generation (SG) stars in globular clusters (GC). SG stars are assumed
to form once first generation asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars start
releasing their ejecta; during this phase, external gas is accreted by the
system and SNe Ia begin exploding, carving hot and tenuous bubbles. Given the
large uncertainty on SNe Ia explosion times, we test two different values for
the 'delay time'. We run two different models for the external gas density: in
the low-density scenario with short delay time, the explosions start at the
beginning of the SG star formation, halting it in its earliest phases. The
external gas hardly penetrates the system, therefore most SG stars present
extreme helium abundances (Y > 0.33). The low-density model with delayed SN
explosions has a more extended SG star formation epoch and includes SG stars
with modest helium enrichment. On the contrary, the high-density model is
weakly affected by SN explosions, with a final SG mass similar to the one
obtained without SNe Ia. Most of the stars form from a mix of AGB ejecta and
pristine gas and have a modest helium enrichment. We show that gas from SNe Ia
may produce an iron spread of $\sim 0.14$ dex, consistent with the spread found
in about 20% of Galactic GCs, suggesting that SNe Ia might have played a key
role in the formation of this sub-sample of GCs.

stationarity assumption even when the true process is not that close to

are randomized, and the recruiters and patients may not be blinded to the
assignment. This often leads to differential recruitment and consequently
systematic differences in baseline characteristics of the recruited patients
between intervention and control arms, inducing post-randomization selection
bias. We rigorously define causal estimands in the presence of selection bias.
We elucidate the conditions under which standard covariate adjustment methods
can validly estimate these estimands. We further discuss the additional data
and assumptions necessary for estimating causal effects when such conditions
are not met. Adopting the principal stratification framework in causal
inference, we clarify there are two average treatment effect (ATE) estimands in
cluster randomized trials: one for the overall population and one for the
recruited population. We derive the analytical formula of the two estimands in
terms of principal-stratum-specific causal effects. Using simulation studies,
we assess the empirical performance of the multivariable regression adjustment
method under different data generating processes leading to selection bias.
When treatment effects are heterogeneous across principal strata, the ATE on
the overall population generally differs from the ATE on the recruited
population. An intention-to-treat analysis of the recruited sample leads to
biased estimates of both ATEs. In the presence of post-randomization selection
and without additional data on the non-recruited subjects, the ATE on the
recruited population is estimable only when the treatment effects are
homogenous between principal strata, and the ATE on the overall population is
generally not estimable. The extent to which covariate adjustment can remove
selection bias depends on the degree of effect heterogeneity across principal
strata.

conceptors are matrices whose size scales quadratically with the number of

In the work reported in this thesis, a variation of conceptors is introduced,
called diagonal conceptors, which are diagonal matrices, thus reducing the
computational cost drastically. It will be shown that diagonal conceptors
achieve the same accuracy as conceptors, but are slightly more unstable. This
instability can be improved, but requires further research. Nevertheless,
diagonal conceptors show to be a promising practical alternative to the

of the history of their formation. In particular, eccentricity is a strong
signature of dynamical formation rather than formation by stellar evolution in
isolated stellar systems. It has been shown that searches for eccentric signals
with quasi-circular templates can lead to loss of SNR, and some signals could
be missed by such a pipeline. We investigate the efficacy of the existing
quasi-circular parameter estimation pipelines to determine the source
parameters of such eccentric systems. We create a set of simulated signals with
eccentricity up to 0.3 and find that as the eccentricity increases, the
recovered mass parameters are consistent with those of a binary with up to a
$\approx 10\%$ higher chirp mass and mass ratio closer to unity. We also employ
a full inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model to perform parameter estimation
on two gravitational wave events, GW151226 and GW170608, to investigate this
bias on real data. We find that the correlation between the masses and
eccentricity persists in real data, but that there is also a correlation
between the measured eccentricity and effective spin. In particular, using a
non-spinning prior results in a spurious eccentricity measurement for GW151226.
Performing parameter estimation with an aligned spin, eccentric model, we

  Acceleration","Accepted by the HPCA 20222, the 28th IEEE International Symposium on
  High-Performance Computer Architecture (HPCA-28)",,,,"cs.AR cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Exploiting sparsity is a key technique in accelerating quantized
convolutional neural network (CNN) inference on mobile devices. Prior sparse
CNN accelerators largely exploit un-structured sparsity and achieve significant
speedups. Due to the unbounded, largely unpredictable sparsity patterns,
however, exploiting unstructured sparsity requires complicated hardware design
with significant energy and area overhead, which is particularly detrimental to
mobile/IoT inference scenarios where energy and area efficiency are crucial. We
propose to exploit structured sparsity, more specifically, Density Bound Block
(DBB) sparsity for both weights and activations. DBB block tensors bound the
maximum number of non-zeros per block. DBB thus exposes statically predictable
sparsity patterns that enable lean sparsity-exploiting hardware. We propose new
hardware primitives to implement DBB sparsity for (static) weights and
(dynamic) activations, respectively, with very low overheads. Building on top
of the primitives, we describe S2TA, a systolic array-based CNN accelerator
that exploits joint weight and activation DBB sparsity and new dimensions of
data reuse unavailable on the traditional systolic array. S2TA in 16nm achieves
more than 2x speedup and energy reduction compared to a strong baseline of a
systolic array with zero-value clock gating, over five popular CNN benchmarks.
Compared to two recent non-systolic sparse accelerators, Eyeriss v2 (65nm) and
SparTen (45nm), S2TA in 65nm uses about 2.2x and 3.1x less energy per
inference, respectively.

close to mediastinum, is needed to more accurately plan and deliver
radiotherapy and to measure treatment response. Therefore, we developed a new
cross-modality educed distillation (CMEDL) approach, using unpaired CT and MRI
scans, whereby an informative teacher MRI network guides a student CT network
to extract features that signal the difference between foreground and
background. Our contribution eliminates two requirements of distillation
methods: (i) paired image sets by using an image to image (I2I) translation and
(ii) pre-training of the teacher network with a large training set by using
concurrent training of all networks. Our framework uses an end-to-end trained
unpaired I2I translation, teacher, and student segmentation networks.
Architectural flexibility of our framework is demonstrated using 3 segmentation
and 2 I2I networks. Networks were trained with 377 CT and 82 T2w MRI from
different sets of patients, with independent validation (N=209 tumors) and
testing (N=609 tumors) datasets. Network design, methods to combine MRI with CT
information, distillation learning under informative (MRI to CT), weak (CT to
MRI) and equal teacher (MRI to MRI), and ablation tests were performed.
Accuracy was measured using Dice similarity (DSC), surface Dice (sDSC), and
Hausdorff distance at the 95$^{th}$ percentile (HD95). The CMEDL approach was
significantly (p $<$ 0.001) more accurate (DSC of 0.77 vs. 0.73) than non-CMEDL
methods with an informative teacher for CT lung tumor, with a weak teacher (DSC
of 0.84 vs. 0.81) for MRI lung tumor, and with equal teacher (DSC of 0.90 vs.

the aim of finding a considerable fraction of Dark Matter (DM), using the
gravitationally enhanced friction mechanism which arises from a nonminimal
derivative coupling between the scalar field and the gravity. Assuming the
nonminimal coupling parameter as a special function of the scalar field and
considering the potential of natural inflation, we find three parameter sets
that produce a period of ultra slow-roll inflation. This leads to sufficiently
large enhancement in the curvature power spectra to form PBHs. We show that
under the gravitationally enhanced friction mechanism, PBHs with a mass around
${\cal O}\big(10^{-12}\big)M_\odot$ can constitute around $96\%$ of the total
DM and so this class of PBHs can be taken as a great candidate for DM. We
further study the secondary Gravitational Waves (GWs) in our setting and show
that our model predicts the peak of the present fractional energy density as
$\Omega_{GW0} \sim 10^{-8}$ at different frequencies for all the three
parameter sets. This value lies well inside the sensitivity region of some GWs
detectors at some frequencies, and therefore the observational compatibility of
our model can be appraised by the data from these detectors.

widely used to reduce the model size and computational complexity of deep
neural network (DNN) for applications in power-constrained scenarios such as

further proposed to automate the DNN pruning process to avoid expensive
hand-crafted work. However, the RL-based pruner involves a time-consuming
training process and the high expense of each sample further exacerbates this
problem. These impediments have greatly restricted the real-world application
of RL-based auto-pruning. Thus, in this paper, we propose an efficient
auto-pruning framework which solves this problem by taking advantage of the
historical data from the previous auto-pruning process. In our framework, we
first boost the convergence of the RL-pruner by transfer learning. Then, an
augmented transfer learning scheme is proposed to further speed up the training
process by improving the transferability. Finally, an assistant learning
process is proposed to improve the sample efficiency of the RL agent. The
experiments have shown that our framework can accelerate the auto-pruning
process by 1.5-2.5 times for ResNet20, and 1.81-2.375 times for other neural

considerable energy dissipation potential for dynamic loadings with varying
strain-rates. The energy dissipation depends on the latent heat generated by
the austenitic-martensitic transformation and the convection of that heat. Due
to the thermomechanical coupling, the martensitic nucleation stress level and
thus the propagation of martensitic phase fronts strongly depends on the
material temperature. High strain-rate interferes with the release of the
latent heat to the environment and determines quantity, position and
propagation of martensitic transformation bands. Lastly, high strain-rate
reduces the hysteresis surface. The propagation velocity and quantity of
martensitic bands have an impact on martensitic phase stability. The degree of
atomic disorder and accordingly the change in entropy influences the reverse
phase transformation from martensite to austenite. In other words, the
stability of the martensitic state affects the stress level of the reverse
transformation. However, in phenomenological superelastic SMA models, which are
used to simulate energy dissipation behavior, the effects of the rate-dependent
entropy change are not considered in particular. To incorporate the
rate-dependent entropy change, we improved a one-dimensional numerical model by
introducing an additional control variable in the free energy formulation for
solid-solid phase transformation of superelastic SMAs. In this model, the
observed effects of the strain-rate on the reverse transformation are taken
into account by calculating the rate-dependent entropy change. A comparison of
the numerical results with the experimental data shows that the model
calculates the dynamic superelastic hysteresis of SMAs more accurately.

existing studies utilize an unproved quaternion feature set, obtained through
simple theoretical deduction. Few studies have put attention on its reliability

choice of ML models in different scenarios still remains unknown. In this
study, the Feature Gradient selector was first adopted to distill the local
optimal feature sets directly from multivariable data. Then, a global optimal
feature set (the channel width, the flow velocity, the channel slope and the
cross sectional area) was proposed through numerical comparison of the
distilled local optimums in performance with representative ML models. The
channel slope is identified to be the key parameter for the prediction of LDC.
Further, we designed a weighted evaluation metric which enables comprehensive
model comparison. With the simple linear model as the baseline, a benchmark of
single and ensemble learning models was provided. Advantages and disadvantages
of the methods involved were also discussed. Results show that the support
vector machine has significantly better performance than other models. Decision

various forms) can lower the total run-time of genetic algorithms, increase the
optimality of a solution, and decrease the variance in an algorithm's
performance. We believe that death-enhanced genetic algorithms can accomplish
this through their unique ability to backtrack out of and/or avoid getting
trapped in local optima altogether.
