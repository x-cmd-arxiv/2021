interactions and mergers, dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) with kiloparsec
separations are rarely observed and are very difficult to identify, in
particular at high redshifts (i.e. z>2). Focussing on the recently discovered
dual AGN system LBQS 0302-0019 at z=3.29, we seek to identify further group
members in its environment and to understand their formation history through
deep high-angular-resolution imaging. We present deep Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) Wide-field Camera 3 near-infrared imaging of LBQS 0302-0019. In
combination with ground-based VLT/HAWK-I imaging, we infer accurate sizes,
colours, ages, and stellar masses of companion galaxies. We clearly detect four
companion objects close to LBQS 0302-0019 that also have faint signatures in
the ground-based images. We constrain light-weighted ages and masses for the
two most prominent companions, Jil1 and Jil2, to $t_\star=252_{-109}^{+222}$Myr
with $\log(M_\star/[\mathrm{M}_\odot])= 11.2_{-0.1}^{+0.3}$ and
$t_{\star}=19_{-14}^{+74}$Myr with $\log(M_\star/[\mathrm{M}_\odot])=
9.4_{-0.4}^{+0.9}$, respectively. The HST data also show that the obscured AGN,
previously identified by strong nebular HeII emission, is associated with the
young massive companion Jil2. Because very massive stars of the starburst
cannot be solely responsible for the HeII emission, we strengthen our initial
conclusion that Jil2 has been hosting an AGN. If the young starburst of Jil2
had been accompanied by sustained black hole growth, Jil2 may have contributed
HeII-ionising flux to create the large HeII Ly$\alpha$ proximity zone around
LBQS 0302-0019. Hence, the duration of the current luminous AGN episode of LBQS
0302-0019 may have been overestimated.

anomalous diffusion at short times and normal diffusion at long times. This

mesoscopic correlation time the power-law correlations between the increments
of fractional Brownian motion. Here, we investigate such tempered fractional
Brownian motion confined to a finite interval by reflecting walls.
Specifically, we explore how the tempering of the long-time correlations
affects the strong accumulation and depletion of particles near reflecting
boundaries recently discovered for untempered fractional Brownian motion. We
find that exponential tempering introduces a characteristic size for the
accumulation and depletion zones but does not affect the functional form of the
probability density close to the wall. In contrast, power-law tempering leads
to more complex behavior that differs between the superdiffusive and
subdiffusive cases.

Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation treating localized spins as classical vectors of
fixed length. However, spin is a genuine quantum degree of freedom, and even
though quantum effects become progressively less important for spin value
$S>1$, they exist for all $S < \infty$. While this has motivated exploration of
limitations/breakdown of the LL equation, by using examples of F insulators,
analogous comparison of fully quantum many-body vs. quantum (for
electrons)-classical (for localized spins) dynamics in systems where
nonequilibrium conduction electrons are present is lacking. Here we employ
quantum Heisenberg F or AF chains of $N=4$ sites, whose localized spins
interact with conduction electrons via $sd$ exchange interaction, to perform
such comparison by starting from unentangled pure (at zero temperature) or
mixed (at finite temperature) quantum state of localized spins as the initial
condition. This reveals that quantum-classical dynamics can faithfully
reproduce fully quantum dynamics in the F metallic case, but only when spin
$S$, Heisenberg exchange between localized spins and $sd$ exchange are
sufficiently small. Increasing any of these three parameters can lead to
substantial deviations, which are explained by the dynamical buildup of
entanglement between localized spins and/or between them and electrons. In the
AF metallic case, substantial deviations appear even at early times, despite
starting from unentangled N\'{e}el state, which therefore poses a challenge on
how to rigorously justify wide usage of the LL equation in phenomenological
modeling of antiferromagnetic spintronics experiments.

online bipartite matching (OBM), called RANKING \cite{KVV}, naturally raises
the possibility of extending this algorithm to the adwords problem, or its
special case called SMALL, in which bids are small compared to budgets; the
latter has been of considerable practical significance in ad auctions
\cite{MSVV}.
  The attractive feature of our approach, in contrast to \cite{MSVV}, was that
it would yield a {\em budget-oblivious algorithm}, i.e., during its execution,
the algorithm would not need to know what fraction of budget each bidder has
spent -- only whether there is budget left-over. This would immediately render
the algorithm useful for autobidding platforms.
  Our attempt met several hurdles, which are described in detail in the paper.
In particular, a substantial probabilistic development led us to obtain an
optimal, online, budget-oblivious algorithm for SINGLE-VALUED, which is
intermediate between OMB and the adwords problem; this algorithm is a natural
generalization of RANKING. For SMALL, we managed to overcome all but one
hurdle, namely failure of a property, called the no-surpassing property.
Interestingly enough, this property plays a minor role in the proofs of RANKING
as well as our algorithm for SINGLE-VALUED.

emerging from Z' production and decay via Drell-Yan, which can be characterised
as belonging to the E6SSM via both the cross section and Forward-Backward

however, depends on how well the telerobot is incorporated into the operator's
sensorimotor control scheme. Empirical evidence suggests that haptic feedback
can lead to improved dexterity. Unfortunately, haptic feedback can also
introduce dynamics between the leader and follower of the telerobot that affect
both stability and device performance. While concerted research effort has
focused on masking these device dynamics or bypassing them altogether, it is
not well understood how human operators incorporate these dynamics into their
control scheme. We believe that to advance dexterous telerobotic manipulation,
it is crucial to understand the process by which humans operators incorporate
teleoperator dynamics and distinguish them from the dynamics of the
environment. Key to this knowledge is an understanding of how advanced
telerobotic architectures compare to the gold standard, the rigid mechanical
teleoperators first introduced in the 1950's. In this manuscript, we present a
teleoperator testbed that has reconfigurable transmissions between the leader

investigate the effect of the teleoperator's dynamics on perception of and task
performance in the remote/virtual environment. We describe the hardware and
software components of the testbed and then demonstrate how the different
teleoperator transmissions can lead to differences, sometimes significant, in
the dynamics that would be felt by the operator when exploring the same
environment.

single-channel insulator is known to possess the universal property, that its
change under a lattice shift towards the edge by one site is given by the sum
of the average bulk electronic density and a topologically invariant
contribution, restricted to the values $0$ and $-1$ [Phys. Rev. B 101, 165304
(2020)]. This quantized contribution is associated with particle-hole duality,
ensures charge conservation and fixes the mod(1) ambiguity appearing in the
Modern Theory of Polarization. In the present work we generalize the
above-mentioned single-channel results to the multichannel case by employing
the technique of boundary Green's functions. We show that the topological
invariant associated with the change in boundary charge under a lattice shift
in multichannel models can be expressed as a winding number of a certain
combination of components of bulk Green's functions as function of the complex
frequency, as it encircles the section of the energy axis that corresponds to
the occupied part of the spectrum. We observe that this winding number is
restricted to values ranging from $-N_c$ to $0$, where $N_c$ is the number of
channels (orbitals) per site. Furthermore, we consider translationally
invariant one-dimensional multichannel models with an impurity and introduce
topological indices which correspond to the quantized charge that accumulates
around said impurity. These invariants are again given in terms of winding
numbers of combinations of components of bulk Green's functions. Through this
construction we provide a rigorous mathematical proof of the so called

fundamental perspective and for potential THz photonic applications. Although
polaritons have been observed by THz far-field spectroscopy on topological

been elusive so far. Here, we show spectroscopic THz near-field images of thin
Bi2Se3 layers (prototypical topological insulators) revealing polaritons with
up to 12 times increased momenta as compared to photons of the same energy and
decay times of about 0.48 ps, yet short propagation lengths. From the images we
determine and analyze the polariton dispersion, showing that the polaritons can
be explained by the coupling of THz radiation to various combinations of Dirac
and massive carriers at the Bi2Se3 surfaces, massive bulk carriers and optical
phonons. Our work provides critical insights into the nature of THz polaritons
in topological insulators and establishes instrumentation and methodology for

induced by a mutation-selection multi-allelic Moran model, whose dynamic is
given by a continuous-time irreducible Markov chain. The rate matrix driving
the mutation is assumed irreducible and the selection rates are assumed
uniformly bounded. The paper is divided into two parts. The first one deals
with processes with general selection rates. For this case we are able to prove
the propagation of chaos in $\mathbb{L}^p$ over the compacts, with speed of
convergence of order $1/\sqrt{N}$. Further on, we consider a specific type of
selection that we call additive selection. Essentially, we assume that the
selection rate can be decomposed as the sum of three terms: a term depending on
the allelic type of the parent (which can be understood as selection at death),
another term depending on the allelic type of the descendant (which can be
understood as selection at birth) and a third term which is symmetric. Under
this setting, our results include a uniform in time bound for the propagation
on chaos in $\mathbb{L}^p$ of order $1/\sqrt{N}$, and the proof of the
asymptotic normality with zero mean and explicit variance, for the
approximation error between the empirical distribution and its limit, when the
number of individuals tend towards infinity. Additionally, we explore the
interpretation of the Moran model with additive selection as a particle process
whose empirical distribution approximates a quasi-stationary distribution, in
the same spirit as the Fleming\,--\,Viot particle systems. We then address the
problem of minimising the asymptotic quadratic error, when the time and the
number of particles go to infinity.

by an adjacent heavy metal represents an efficient tool for the excitation and
manipulation of spin waves. Here we report the micromagnetic simulations
describing the influence of SOT on the propagation of spin waves in the
$\mathrm{W}/\mathrm{CoFeB}/\mathrm{MgO}$ nanostructure having
voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA). The simulations show that two
spin waves travelling in the opposite directions can be generated in the center
of the $\mathrm{CoFeB}$ waveguide via the modulation of VCMA induced by a
microwave voltage locally applied to the $\mathrm{MgO}$ nanolayer. The
amplitudes of these waves exponentially decrease with the propagation distance
with similar decay lengths of about 2.5 $\mu$m. In the presence of a direct
electric current injected into the $\mathrm{W}$ film beneath the waveguide
center, the decay lengths of two spin waves change in the opposite way owing to
different directions of the electric currents flowing in the underlying halves
of the $\mathrm{W}$ layer. Remarkably, above the critical current density
$J_\mathrm{W} \approx 2 \times 10^{10}$ A m$^{-2}$, SOT provides the
amplification of the spin wave propagating in one half of the waveguide and
strongly accelerates the attenuation of the wave travelling in the other half.
As a result, a long-distance spin-wave propagation takes place in a half of the
$\mathrm{CoFeB}$ waveguide only. Furthermore, by reversing the polarity of the
dc voltage applied to the heavy-metal layer one can change the propagation area
and switch the travel direction of the spin wave in the ferromagnetic
waveguide. Thus, the $\mathrm{W}/\mathrm{CoFeB}/\mathrm{MgO}$ nanostructure can
be employed as an electrically controlled magnonic device converting the
electrical input signal into a spin signal, which can be transmitted to one of
two outputs of the device.

The time

lensed GRBs, in principle, should have repeated pulses with identical light
curves and spectra but different fluxes and slightly offset positions. In this
work, we search for such candidates within the GRBs detected by Fermi/GBM,
Swift/BAT, and HXMT/HE and report the identification of an attractive event GRB
200716C that consists of two pulses. Both the autocorrelation analysis and the
Bayesian inference of the prompt emission light curve are in favor of the
gravitational lensing scenario. Moreover, the spectral properties of the two
pulses are rather similar and follow the so-called Amati relation of short GRBs
rather than long duration bursts. The measured flux ratios between the two
pulses are nearly constant in all channels, as expected from gravitational
lensing. We therefore suggest that the long duration burst GRB 200716C was a
short event being lensed. The redshifted mass of the lens was estimated to be
$4.25^{+2.46}_{-1.36}$ $\times$ $10^5$ $M_{\odot}$ (90$\%$ credibility). If

  - We show that any symmetric degree-$d$ $\mathbb{F}_2$-polynomial $p$ has
$L_{1,k}(p) \le \Pr[p=1] \cdot O(d)^k$, and this is tight for any constant $k$.
This quadratically strengthens an earlier bound that was implicit in [RSV13].
  - We show that any read-$\Delta$ degree-$d$ $\mathbb{F}_2$-polynomial $p$ has
$L_{1,k}(p) \le \Pr[p=1] \cdot (k \Delta d)^{O(k)}$.
  - We establish a composition theorem which gives $L_{1,k}$ bounds on disjoint
compositions of functions that are closed under restrictions and admit
$L_{1,k}$ bounds.

by a set of arbitrary constraints that limit the relative motion between pairs
of bodies. Such a general definition encompasses a wide variety of situations
in the microscopic world, from bacteria to synthetic micro-swimmers, but it is
also encountered when discretizing inextensible bodies, such as filaments or
membranes. Simulating suspensions of such articulated bodies requires to solve
the hydrodynamic interactions between large collections of objects of arbitrary
shape while satisfying the multiple constraints that connect them. Two main
challenges arise in this task: limiting the cost of the hydrodynamic solves,
and enforcing the constraints within machine precision at each time-step. To
address these challenges we propose a formalism that combines the body mobility
problem in Stokes flow with a velocity formulation of the constraints,
resulting in a mixed mobility-resistance problem. While resistance problems are
known to scale poorly with the particle number, our preconditioned iterative
solver is not sensitive to the system size. Constraint violations, e.g. due to
discrete time-integration errors, are prevented by correcting the particles'
positions and orientations at the end of each time-step. Our correction
procedure, based on a nonlinear minimisation algorithm, is negligible in terms
of computational cost and preserves the accuracy of the time-integration
scheme. We showcase the robustness and scalability of our method by exploring
the locomotion modes of a model microswimmer inspired by the diatom colony
Bacillaria Paxillifer, and by simulating large suspensions of bacteria
interacting near a no-slip boundary. Finally, we provide a Python

this approach allows for labeling larger datasets at an equivalent labeling
cost. However, for sufficiently large datasets, labeling all bags may become
prohibitively costly. Active learning uses an iterative labeling and retraining

triage test to differentiate between clinically significant (cS) and
non-clinically significant (ncS) prostate lesions. However, analysis of the
sequences relies on expertise, requires specialized training, and suffers from
inter-observer variability. Deep learning (DL) techniques hold promise in tasks
such as classification and detection. Nevertheless, they rely on large amounts

palliate such issues, existing works rely on transfer learning (TL) and

generalizing the celebrated result by Friesecke, James, and M\""uller to the
setting of variable domains. Loosely speaking, we show that for each $y \in
H^1(U;\mathbb{R}^d)$ and for each connected component of a smooth open, bounded
set $U \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, the $L^2$-distance of $\nabla y$ from a single
rotation can be controlled up to a constant by its $L^2$-distance from the
group $SO(d)$, with the constant not depending on the precise shape of $U$, but
only on an integral curvature functional related to $\partial U$. We further
show that for linear strains the estimate can be refined, leading to a uniform
control independent of the set $U$. The estimate can be used to establish
compactness in the space of generalized special functions of bounded
deformation ($GSBD^2$) for sequences of displacements related to deformations
with uniformly bounded elastic energy. As an application, we rigorously derive
linearized models for nonlinearly elastic materials with free surfaces by means
of $\Gamma$-convergence. In particular, we study energies related to
epitaxially strained crystalline films and to the formation of material voids
inside elastically stressed solids.

every possible optical state in the propagation volume. The resulting light

metrics to compare the pipeline performances quantitatively. In general, they
can recover the input maps' 2-point statistics within 20 per cent in the range

appear in the cleaned maps due to interactions between the foreground structure

We prove that the upper bound on the size of such class of linear codes is
$2^n$ when $q=2$ as conjectured by Braun et al. Moreover, the codes attaining
this bound are shown to have structures akin to combinatorial objects, viz.
\emph{Fano plane} and \emph{sunflower}. We also prove the existence of

are useful in distributed storage because a single erasure can be corrected
quickly either by reading its row or column. Maximally Recoverable (MR) Tensor
Codes, introduced by Gopalan et al., are tensor codes which can correct every
erasure pattern that is information theoretically possible to correct. The main
questions about MR Tensor Codes are characterizing which erasure patterns are
correctable and obtaining explicit constructions over small fields.
  In this paper, we study the important special case when $a=1$, i.e., the

higher order MDS codes (MDS$(\ell)$ codes) which is an interesting

genericity of points in a low-dimensional space. We then prove that a tensor

activity data which aggregates the edge-activity data and thus is less

to recover the richer edge activities from the node activities? Here we show
that recovery is possible, often with a surprising degree of accuracy given how
much information is lost, and that the recovered data are useful for subsequent
network analysis tasks. Recovery is more difficult when network density
increases, either topologically or dynamically, but exploiting dynamical and
topological sparsity enables effective solutions to the recovery problem. We
formally characterize the difficulty of the recovery problem both theoretically

bounded and showing that, even when these conditions are not met, good quality
solutions can still be derived. Effective recovery carries both promise and

experimental approach, we probe nine different stacking sequences: G, GG, MG,
GGG, GMG, GGMG, GMGG, GMMG, GMGMG and identify the effects of vibrational
mismatch, interlayer adhesion, and junction asymmetry on thermal transport.
Pure G sequences display signatures of quasi-ballistic transport, whereas
adding even a single M layer strongly disrupts heat conduction. The
experimental data are described well by molecular dynamics simulations which
include thermal expansion, accounting for the effect of finite temperature on
the interlayer spacing. The simulations show that a change of only 1.5% in the
layer separation can lead to a nearly 100% increase of the thermal resistance.
Using these design rules, we experimentally demonstrate a 5-layer GMGMG
superlattice with an ultralow effective cross-plane thermal conductivity
comparable to air, paving the way for a new class of thermal metamaterials with

already been used to place strong constrains on the existence of light scalar
fields, which are a common feature in many alternative theories of gravity.
However, spin effects are still relatively unexplored in this context. In this
work, we construct an effective point-particle action for a generic spinning
body that can couple both conformally and disformally to a real scalar field,
and we show that requiring the existence of a self-consistent solution
automatically implies that if a scalar couples to the mass of a body, then it
must also couple to its spin. We then use well-established effective field
theory techniques to conduct a comprehensive study of spin-orbit effects in
binary systems to leading order in the post-Newtonian (PN) expansion. Focusing
on quasicircular nonprecessing binaries for simplicity, we systematically
compute all key quantities, including the conservative potential, the orbital
binding energy, the radiated power, and the gravitational-wave phase. We show
that depending on how strongly each member of the binary couples to the scalar,
the spin-orbit effects that are due to a conformal coupling first enter into
the phase at either 0.5PN or 1.5PN order, while those that arise from a
disformal coupling start at either 3.5PN or 4.5PN order. This suppression by
additional PN orders notwithstanding, we find that the disformal spin-orbit
terms can actually dominate over their conformal counterparts due to an
enhancement by a large prefactor. Accordingly, our results suggest that
upcoming gravitational-wave detectors could be sensitive to disformal
spin-orbit effects in double neutron star binaries if at least one of the two
bodies is sufficiently scalarised.

computers. Previous work for mitigating noise has primarily focused on
gate-level or pulse-level noise-adaptive compilation. However, limited research
efforts have explored a higher level of optimization by making the quantum
circuits themselves resilient to noise.
  We propose QuantumNAS, a comprehensive framework for noise-adaptive co-search
of the variational circuit and qubit mapping. Variational quantum circuits are
a promising approach for constructing QML and quantum simulation. However,
finding the best variational circuit and its optimal parameters is challenging
due to the large design space and parameter training cost. We propose to
decouple the circuit search and parameter training by introducing a novel
SuperCircuit. The SuperCircuit is constructed with multiple layers of
pre-defined parameterized gates and trained by iteratively sampling and
updating the parameter subsets (SubCircuits) of it. It provides an accurate
estimation of SubCircuits performance trained from scratch. Then we perform an
evolutionary co-search of SubCircuit and its qubit mapping. The SubCircuit
performance is estimated with parameters inherited from SuperCircuit and
simulated with real device noise models. Finally, we perform iterative gate
pruning and finetuning to remove redundant gates.
  Extensively evaluated with 12 QML and VQE benchmarks on 14 quantum computers,
QuantumNAS significantly outperforms baselines. For QML, QuantumNAS is the

contributions from an intrinsic component, which in turn produces different
aberration and Doppler couplings. Moreover, the standard conversion from
intensity measurements into temperature also introduces spurious Doppler-like
couplings. In order to learn about the intrinsic dipole it is therefore
important to measure both aberration and Doppler couplings in an independent
manner while also removing the spurious contributions from unit conversion,
which are degenerate with the dipole. Here we present a pipeline to measure the
Doppler and aberration signal independently from each other and from the dipole
itself. We also consider realistic beaming, noise and mask effects. Our
pipeline results in independent and unbiased estimators which have
uncertainties only ~20% larger than the simple theoretical expectations. We
discuss the achievable precision in each measurement for Planck 2018, and also
forecast them for future ground-based experiments with the Simons Observatory
and CMB-S4. An alternative pipeline is presented in order to cross-check
results and improve robustness.

quantum Hall states that may provide a new avenue toward manipulating
non-abelian excitations. Early theoretical studies have predicted their
existence in systems with energetically flat Chern bands and highlighted the
critical role of a particular quantum band geometry. Thus far, however, FCI
states have only been observed in Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene aligned with
hexagonal boron nitride (BLG/hBN), in which a very large magnetic field is
responsible for the existence of the Chern bands, precluding the realization of
FCIs at zero field and limiting its potential for applications. By contrast,
magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) supports flat Chern bands at zero
magnetic field, and therefore offers a promising route toward stabilizing
zero-field FCIs. Here we report the observation of eight FCI states at low
magnetic field in MATBG enabled by high-resolution local compressibility
measurements. The first of these states emerge at 5 T, and their appearance is
accompanied by the simultaneous disappearance of nearby topologically-trivial
charge density wave states. Unlike the BLG/hBN platform, we demonstrate that
the principal role of the weak magnetic field here is merely to redistribute
the Berry curvature of the native Chern bands and thereby realize a quantum
band geometry favorable for the emergence of FCIs. Our findings strongly
suggest that FCIs may be realized at zero magnetic field and pave the way for
the exploration and manipulation of anyonic excitations in moir\'e systems with
native flat Chern bands.

constrain their torus parameters with the X-ray clumpy torus model XCLUMPY
(Tanimoto et al. 2019). Among the AGNs at $z < 0.03$, for which sample biases
are minimized, the fraction of Compton-thick ($N_{\rm H} \geq 10^{24}$
cm$^{-2}$) AGNs reaches 64$^{+14}_{-15}$% (6/9 sources) in late mergers, while
24$^{+12}_{-10}$% (3/14 sources) in early mergers, consistent with the tendency
reported by Ricci et al. (2017). We find that the bolometric AGN luminosities
derived from the infrared data increase, but the X-ray to bolometric luminosity
ratios decrease, with merger stage. The X-ray weak AGNs in late mergers
ubiquitously show massive outflows at sub-pc to kpc scales. Among them, the
most luminous AGNs ($L_{\rm bol,AGN} \sim 10^{46}$ erg s$^{-1}$) have
relatively small column densities of $\lesssim$10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ and almost
super-Eddington ratios ($\lambda_{\rm Edd} \sim$ 1.0). Their torus covering
factors ($C_{\rm T}^{\rm (22)} \sim 0.6$) are larger than those of Swift/BAT
selected AGNs with similarly high Eddington ratios. These results suggest a
scenario that, in the final stage of mergers, multiphase strong outflows are
produced due to chaotic quasi-spherical inflows and the AGN becomes extremely
X-ray weak and deeply buried due to obscuration by inflowing and/or outflowing
material.

assembly of galaxies. Recently, many works have suggested a possible increase
in the fraction of major mergers in the early Universe, reviving the debate on
which processes (e.g., cold accretion, star formation, mergers) most contribute
to the mass build-up of galaxies through cosmic time. To estimate the
importance of major mergers in this context, we make use of the new data
collected by the ALMA Large Program to INvestigate [CII] at Early times
(ALPINE), which observed the [CII] 158 $\mu$m emission line from a sample of 75
main-sequence star-forming galaxies at 4.4 < z < 5.9. We used, for the first
time, the morpho-kinematic information provided by the [CII] emission to obtain
the fraction of major mergers ($f_{MM}$) at z~5. By adopting different
prescriptions for the merger timescales ($T_{MM}$), we converted this fraction
into the merger rate per galaxy ($R_{MM}$) and per volume ($\Gamma_{MM}$). We
then combined our results with those at lower redshifts from the literature,
computing the cosmic evolution of the merger fraction. This is described by a
rapid increase from z~0 to higher redshifts, a peak at z~3, and a slow decrease
towards earlier epochs. Depending on the timescale prescription used, this
fraction translates into a merger rate ranging between ~0.1 and ~4.0 Gyr$^{-1}$
at z~5. Finally, we compare the specific star formation and star-formation rate
density with the analogous quantities from major mergers. Our new ALPINE data
reveal the presence of a significant merging activity in the early Universe.
However, whether this population of mergers can provide a relevant contribution
to the galaxy mass assembly at these redshifts and through the cosmic epochs is
strongly dependent on the assumption of the merger timescale.

effects for a variety of FRB population models and compare the simulated

corresponding distributions from the CHIME/FRB catalog. Our simulations confirm
the results of previous population studies, which suggested that the
interstellar medium of the host galaxy alone (simulated based on the NE2001
model) cannot explain the observed scattering timescales of FRBs. We therefore
consider additional sources of scattering, namely, the circumgalactic medium
(CGM) of intervening galaxies and the circumburst medium whose properties are
modeled based on typical Galactic plane environments. We find that a population
of FRBs with scattering contributed by these media is marginally consistent
with the CHIME/FRB catalog. In this scenario, our simulations favor a
population of FRBs offset from their galaxy centers over a population which is
distributed along the spiral arms. However, if the models proposing the CGM as
a source of intense scattering are incorrect, then we conclude that FRBs may
inhabit environments with more extreme properties than those inferred for
pulsars in the Milky Way.

captured in the same spectrum, as happens most commonly with double-lined
spectroscopic binaries (SB2s), although random line of sight alignments of

$F_{SB2}$ with temperature of a star. We are also able to recover a higher
$F_{SB2}$ in sources with lower metallicity, however there are some
observational biases. We also examine light curves from TESS to determine which

cataclysmic variables using an upgraded version of the 3D CYCLOPS code. This 3D
representation of the accretion flow allows us to properly model total and
partial occultation of the post-shock region by the white dwarf as well as the
modulation of the X-ray light curves due to the phase-dependent extinction of
the pre-shock region. We carried out detailed post-shock region modeling in a
four-dimensional parameter space by varying the white dwarf mass and magnetic
field strength as well as the magnetosphere radius and the specific accretion
rate. To calculate the post-shock region temperature and density profiles, we
assumed equipartition between ions and electrons, took into account the white
dwarf gravitational potential, the finite size of the magnetosphere and a
dipole-like magnetic field geometry, and considered cooling by both
bremsstrahlung and cyclotron radiative processes. By investigating the impact
of the parameters on the resulting X-ray continuum spectra, we show that there
is an inevitable degeneracy in the four-dimensional parameter space
investigated here, which compromises X-ray continuum spectral fitting
strategies and can lead to incorrect parameter estimates. However, the
inclusion of X-ray light curves in different energy ranges can break this
degeneracy, and it therefore remains, in principle, possible to use X-ray data
to derive fundamental parameters of magnetic cataclysmic variables, which
represents an essential step toward understanding their formation and
evolution.

supermassive black hole (SMBH). In this work, we explore the idea that the NSC
forms before the SMBH through the merger of several stellar clusters that may
contain intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). These IMBHs can subsequently
grow by mergers and accretion to form an SMBH. To check the observable
consequences of this proposed SMBH seeding mechanism, we created an
observationally motivated mock population of galaxies, in which NSCs are
constructed by aggregating stellar clusters that may or may not contain IMBHs.
We model the growth of IMBHs in the NSCs through gravitational wave (GW)
mergers with other IMBHs and gas accretion. In the case of GW mergers, the
merged BH can either be retained or ejected depending on the GW recoil kick it
receives. The likelihood of retaining the merged BH increases if we consider
growth of IMBHs in the NSC through gas accretion. We find that nucleated
lower-mass galaxies ($\rm M_{\star} \lesssim 10^{9} \ M_{\odot}$; e.g. M33)
have an SMBH seed occupation fraction of about 0.3 to 0.5. This occupation
fraction increases with galaxy stellar mass and for more massive galaxies ($\rm
10^{9} \ M_{\odot} \lesssim \rm M_{\star} \lesssim 10^{11} \ M_{\odot}$), it is
between 0.5 and 0.8, depending on how BH growth is modelled. These occupation
fractions are consistent with observational constraints. Furthermore, allowing
for BH growth also allows us to reproduce the observed diversity in the mass
range of SMBHs in the $\rm M_{\rm NSC} - M_{\rm BH}$ plane.

galactic scales into the close environments of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN),
obscuring and feeding the supermassive black hole (SMBH). Both recent
simulations and observations of AGN in mergers have confirmed that mergers are
related to strong nuclear obscuration. However, it is still unclear how AGN
obscuration evolves in the last phases of the merger process. We study a sample
of 60 Luminous and Ultra-luminous IR galaxies (U/LIRGs) from the GOALS sample
observed by NuSTAR. We find that the fraction of AGN that are Compton-thick
(CT; $N_{\rm H}\geq 10^{24}\rm\,cm^{-2}$) peaks at $74_{-19}^{+14}\%$ at a late
merger stage, prior to coalescence, when the nuclei have projected separations
of $d_{\rm sep}\sim 0.4-6$ kpc. A similar peak is also observed in the median
$N_{\rm H}$ [$(1.6\pm0.5)\times10^{24}\rm\,cm^{-2}$]. The vast majority
($85^{+7}_{-9}\%$) of the AGN in the final merger stages ($d_{\rm sep}\lesssim
10$ kpc) are heavily obscured ($N_{\rm H}\geq 10^{23}\rm\,cm^{-2}$), and the
median $N_{\rm H}$ of the accreting SMBHs in our sample is systematically
higher than that of local hard X-ray selected AGN, regardless of the merger
stage. This implies that these objects have very obscured nuclear environments,
with the $N_{\rm H}\geq 10^{23}\rm\,cm^{-2}$ gas almost completely covering the
AGN in late mergers. CT AGN tend to have systematically higher
absorption-corrected X-ray luminosities than less obscured sources. This could
either be due to an evolutionary effect, with more obscured sources accreting
more rapidly because they have more gas available in their surroundings, or to
a selection bias. The latter scenario would imply that we are still missing a
large fraction of heavily obscured, lower luminosity ($L_{2-10}\lesssim
10^{43}\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$) AGN in U/LIRGs.

parameters beyond those already present in the $B_{d,s}$ and $K$ meson systems
analyzed in the past. As a result, definite ranges for new Physics (NP) effects
in various charm observables could be obtained. While generally NP effects turn
out to be small, in a number of observables they are much larger than the tiny

branching ratio of the mode $D^0 \to \mu^+ \mu^-$, despite remaining tiny, can
be enhanced by 6 orders of magnitude with respect to the SM. We work out
correlations between this mode and rare $B_{d,s}$ and $K$ decays. We also
discuss neutral charm meson oscillations and CP violation in the charm system.
In particular, we point out that 331 models provide new weak phases that are a
necessary condition to have non-vanishing CP asymmetries. In the case of
$\Delta A_{CP}$, the difference between the CP asymmetries in $D^0 \to K^+ K^-$
and $D^0 \to \pi^+ \pi^-$, we find that agreement with experiment can be

the execution of many numerical tasks such as optimization, inverse problems,

of high-dimensional parametrized systems. In this work we propose a new method
called local active subspaces (LAS), which explores the synergies of active
subspaces with supervised clustering techniques in order to carry out a more
efficient dimension reduction in the parameter space. The clustering is
performed without losing the input-output relations by introducing a distance
metric induced by the global active subspace. We present two possible
clustering algorithms: K-medoids and a hierarchical top-down approach, which is
able to impose a variety of subdivision criteria specifically tailored for
parameter space reduction tasks. This method is particularly useful for the
community working on surrogate modelling. Frequently, the parameter space
presents subdomains where the objective function of interest varies less on
average along different directions. So, it could be approximated more
accurately if restricted to those subdomains and studied separately. We tested
the new method over several numerical experiments of increasing complexity, we
show how to deal with vectorial outputs, and how to classify the different
regions with respect to the local active subspace dimension. Employing this
classification technique as a preprocessing step in the parameter space, or
output space in case of vectorial outputs, brings remarkable results for the
purpose of surrogate modelling.

defense approaches have been extensively studied for a single ML model. In this
work, we aim to analyze and provide the certified robustness for ensemble ML
models, together with the sufficient and necessary conditions of robustness for
different ensemble protocols. Although ensemble models are shown more robust
than a single model empirically; surprisingly, we find that in terms of the

diversified gradient and large confidence margin are sufficient and necessary

adaptively learning a best-fit linear dynamics model over snapshots of
temporal, or spatio-temporal, data. A diversity of regression techniques have
been developed for producing the linear model approximation whose solutions are
exponentials in time. For spatio-temporal data, DMD provides low-rank and
interpretable models in the form of dominant modal structures along with their
exponential/oscillatory behavior in time. The majority of DMD algorithms,
however, are prone to bias errors from noisy measurements of the dynamics,
leading to poor model fits and unstable forecasting capabilities. The optimized
DMD algorithm minimizes the model bias with a variable projection optimization,
thus leading to stabilized forecasting capabilities. Here, the optimized DMD
algorithm is improved by using statistical bagging methods whereby a single set
of snapshots is used to produce an ensemble of optimized DMD models. The
outputs of these models are averaged to produce a bagging, optimized dynamic
mode decomposition (BOP-DMD). BOP-DMD not only improves performance, it also
robustifies the model and provides both spatial and temporal uncertainty
quantification (UQ). Thus unlike currently available DMD algorithms, BOP-DMD
provides a stable and robust model for probabilistic, or Bayesian forecasting

consequent repercussions on performance. This discussion aims at analyzing the
state of the art of current available Layer II solutions to overcome these

highlighting the main differences among the examined frameworks. The structure
of the work is based on three major sections. In particular, the first one is
an introductory part about the technology, the scalability issue and Layer II
as a solution. The second section represents the core of the discussion and
consists of three different subsections, each with a detailed examination of
the respective solution (Lightning Network, Plasma, Rollups); the analysis of
each solution is based on how it affects five key aspects of blockchain
technology and Layer II: scalability, security, decentralization, privacy, fees
and micropayments (the last two are analyzed together given their high
correlation). Finally, the third section includes a tabular summary, followed
by a detailed description of a use-case specifically thought for a practical
evaluation of the presented frameworks. The results of the work met
expectations: all solutions effectively contribute to increasing scalability. A
crucial clarification is that none of the three dominates the others in all
possible fields of application, and the consequences in adopting each, are
different. Therefore, the choice depends on the application context, and a
trade-off must be found between the aspects previously mentioned.

previously shown that Av($\sigma$)-PPM is polynomial for any $\sigma$ of size

applications of computer vision such as mobile robotics or autonomous driving.
To deal with the inverse problem of reconstructing 3D objects from their 2D
projections, a common strategy is to incorporate prior object knowledge into
the reconstruction approach by establishing a 3D model and aligning it to the
2D image plane. However, current approaches are limited due to inadequate shape
priors and the insufficiency of the derived image observations for a reliable
alignment with the 3D model. The goal of this paper is to show how 3D object
reconstruction can profit from a more sophisticated shape prior and from a
combined incorporation of different observation types inferred from the images.
We introduce a subcategory-aware deformable vehicle model that makes use of a
prediction of the vehicle type for a more appropriate regularisation of the
vehicle shape. A multi-branch CNN is presented to derive predictions of the
vehicle type and orientation. This information is also introduced as prior
information for model fitting. Furthermore, the CNN extracts vehicle keypoints
and wireframes, which are well-suited for model-to-image association and model
fitting. The task of pose estimation and reconstruction is addressed by a
versatile probabilistic model. Extensive experiments are conducted using two
challenging real-world data sets on both of which the benefit of the developed
shape prior can be shown. A comparison to state-of-the-art methods for vehicle
pose estimation shows that the proposed approach performs on par or better,
confirming the suitability of the developed shape prior and probabilistic model
for vehicle reconstruction.

functions are adjusted (i.e. fitted) to accommodate data. The effect of
selection bias is then represented by smooth evolution of model parameters with
$n_{ch}$. To evaluate the quality of model fits, Z-scores (data-model
differences divided by statistical uncertainties) are evaluated and compared
with data/model ratios that are often used for such comparisons. Based on
Z-scores the variable TCM is compared with two other frequently-invoked models:
the Tsallis model and the blast-wave model as they have been recently applied
to the same spectrum data. The results are relevant to recent claims that
collectivity (various flow manifestations) as a possible manifestation of QGP
formation is observed in small systems. Data systematics suggest that these
$p$-$p$ $p_t$ spectra are consistent with conventional QCD.

individuals to mate and produce new generations of species. Allocation of
resources is a key factor in GS. At each selection cycle, breeders are facing
the choice of budget allocation to make crosses and produce the next generation
of breeding parents. Inspired by recent advances in reinforcement learning for
AI problems, we develop a reinforcement learning-based algorithm to
automatically learn to allocate limited resources across different generations
of breeding. We mathematically formulate the problem in the framework of Markov
Decision Process (MDP) by defining state and action spaces. To avoid the
explosion of the state space, an integer linear program is proposed that
quantifies the trade-off between resources and time. Finally, we propose a
value function approximation method to estimate the action-value function and
then develop a greedy policy improvement technique to find the optimal
resources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing
genetic gain using a case study with realistic data.

to left truncation, a type of selection bias induced due to patients needing to
survive long enough to satisfy certain entry criteria. Standard methods to

between entry and survival times, which may not always be satisfied in

independence can result in unbiased estimation of common statistical

observational causal inference methodology applied to real world external

the outer geometry of AGN by studying the observed hard X-ray spectrum of
obscured sources. We primarily aim at researching the reflected emission in
these sources. To that end, we analysed archived NuSTAR observations of a
sample of nearby AGN, whose X-ray emission has been found to be heavily
absorbed, with $10^{23}<N_\text{H}<2.5\cdot 10^{23}\text{ cm}^{-2}$; the upper
limit on $N_\text{H}$ was necessary due to the analysis we followed and the
data quality. Fitting their emission with both a phenomelogical and a physical
model, we investigated the relation between reflection and absorption. The
strength of reflected emission, as well as the equivalent width of the Fe
K$\alpha$ line, correlates with the absorption column density, which can be
explained with a clumpy torus origin for the reflection in these sources. The
shape of the observed correlation is found to be well reproduced when the
effects of a clumpy torus with a variable filling factor are simulated. A
similar increase in reflection seems to be featured even by sources with larger
absorption, reaching the Compton thick ($N_\text{H}>1.5\cdot 10^{24}\text{

of the parity-time (PT) symmetric architecture. The analytical study of the
free-space mode propagation from the grating structure indicates the unique
bifurcation property due to the PT-symmetry modulation. It is shown that both
the gain/loss contrast and the lattice constant parameters are critical factors
to modulate the active photonic system in between the PT-symmetry to the
symmetry-broken phases. Furthermore, numerical simulations via the Rigorous
Coupled-Wave Analysis (RCWA) method discover the existence of a unique Spectral
Singularity (SS) phenomenon in this PT grating structure, which corresponds to
a non-trivial single-mode and near-zero bandwidth photonic resonant emission.
Also, the guiding procedure for fulfilling SS modes is found to be related to
the unique formation of the scattering matrix applied in the PT-symmetric
photonic gratings. This theoretical work takes a fresh look into the active
PT-symmetric photonic gratings focusing on the discovery of new free-space
emission modes rather than the commonly studied unidirectional properties,
which could contribute to the development of novel low-threshold and
super-coherent surface-emitting devices.

reach performances that are comparable to those achieved by SDM. However,
additional analysis consistently suggests that TLMs do not capture important

cross-domain accuracy is significantly improved, thereby achieving superior
performance over the conventional IFL counterparts.

focus on the impact of mass accretion on the surface composition, internal
rotation, and structure of the accretor. To anchor our models, we show that our
accretor broadly reproduces the properties of {\zeta} Ophiuchi, which has long
been proposed to have accreted mass before being ejected as a runaway star when
the companion exploded. We compare our accretor to models of single rotating
stars and find that the later and stronger spin-up provided by mass accretion
produces significant differences. Specifically, the core of the accretor
retains higher spin at the end of the main sequence, and a convective layer
develops that changes its density profile. Moreover, the surface of the
accretor star is polluted by CNO-processed material donated by the companion.
Our models show effects of mass accretion in binaries that are not captured in
single rotating stellar models. This possibly impacts the further evolution
(either in a binary or as single stars), the final collapse, and the resulting
spin of the compact object.

identifying the essential notions that enable program specification and
verification. Following that perspective, prior work identified minimal session
types (MSTs), a sub-class of session types without the sequentiality construct
(;), which specifies the structure of communication actions. This notion led to
establish a minimality result: every process typable with standard session
types can be compiled down to a process typable using MSTs, which mimics
sequentiality in types via additional synchronizations. Such a minimality
result is significant because it justifies session types in terms of
themselves, without resorting to external notions; it was proven for a
higher-order session $\pi$-calculus, where values are abstractions (functions
from names to processes). This paper studies MSTs and their associated
minimality result but now for the session $\pi$-calculus, the (first-order)
language in which values are names and for which session types have been more
widely studied. We first show that this new minimality result can be obtained
by composing known results. Then, we develop optimizations of this new

right hand sides are typically computed via analytical or numerical quadrature
of the layer potential multiplied by some function over line, triangle and
tetrahedral volume elements. When the problem size gets large, the resulting
linear systems are often solved iteratively via Krylov subspace methods, with
fast multipole methods (FMM) used to accelerate the matrix vector products
needed. When FMM acceleration is used, most entries of the matrix never need be
computed explicitly - {\em they are only needed in terms of their contribution
to the multipole expansion coefficients.} We propose a new fast method -
\emph{Quadrature to Expansion (Q2X)} - for the analytical generation of the
multipole expansion coefficients produced by the integral expressions for
single and double layers on surface triangles; charge distributions over line
segments and over tetrahedra in the volume; so that the overall method is well
integrated into the FMM, with controlled error. The method is based on the
$O(1)$ per moment cost recursive computation of the moments. The method is
developed for boundary element methods involving the Laplace Green's function
in ${\mathbb R}^3$. The derived recursions are first compared against classical
quadrature algorithms, and then integrated into FMM accelerated boundary
element and vortex element methods. Numerical tests are presented and
discussed.

field of biomedical imaging which works on the principle of interferometry. The
theory behind achieving interference in QPM with conventional light sources
such as white light and lasers is very well developed. Recently, the use of
dynamic speckle illumination (DSI) in QPM has attracted attention due to its
advantages over conventional light sources such as high spatial phase
sensitivity, single shot, scalable field of view (FOV) and resolution. However,
the understanding behind obtaining interference fringes in QPM with DSI has not
been convincingly covered previously. This imposes a constraint on obtaining
interference fringes in QPM using DSI and limits its widespread penetration in
the field of biomedical imaging. The present article provides the basic
understanding of DSI through both simulation and experiments that is essential
to build interference optical microscopy systems such as QPM, digital
holographic microscopy and optical coherence tomography. Using the developed
theory of DSI we demonstrate its capabilities of using non-identical objective
lenses in both arms of the interference microscopy without degrading the
interference fringe contrast and providing the flexibility to use user-defined
microscope objective lens. It is also demonstrated that the interference
fringes are not washed out over a large range of optical path difference (OPD)
between the object and the reference arm providing competitive edge over low
temporal coherence light sources. The theory and explanation developed here
would enable wider penetration of DSI based QPM for applications in biology and

alternative resources. In this study, adsorption using chitosan was
investigated as a sustainable technique to recover Ni from sulfate (SO42-) and
calcium (Ca) rich secondary resources. The effects of pH, contact time, and the
presence of SO42- and Ca on Ni adsorption were investigated in batch
experiments. Chemical speciation modeling was performed to analyze how the
predominant Ni species present under different conditions may affect the
efficiency of the adsorption process. The comparison of the maximum Ni
adsorption capacities of chitosan in the absence (1.00 mmol/g) and presence
(1.49 mmol/g) of 500 mM SO42- and 10 mM Ca indicated the positive effect of
these ions on Ni adsorption. The predominance of the neutrally charged (NiSO4)0
species in Ni/SO42- system has contributed to the enhanced Ni adsorption on
chitosan as verified by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis.
However, kinetic studies confirmed that the Ni adsorption rate decreased by 4.5
times when SO42- was present. The subsequent continuous Ni adsorption from a
real SO42-rich leachate in a column setup revealed that chitosan is selective
for Ni over Ca and Cr with selectivity quotients of 9.6 (K Ni/Ca) and 3.0 (K
Ni/Cr). Overall, this study indicated that Ni complexation with SO42- enhances
the Ni adsorption capacity of chitosan, but slows down the adsorption process.

approach to find the global minimum of the deterministic constraint function

significant differences in eclipse depths and timings year-to-year. Zasche &
Paschke (2012) revealed that HS Hydrae's eclipses were rapidly fading from
view, predicting they would cease around 2022. Using 25 days of photometric
data from Sector 009 of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), we
find that the primary eclipses for HS Hydrae were only 0.00173+/-0.00007 mag in

detected from HS Hydrae. We also searched the Digitization of the Harvard

has emerged as a powerful tool for detecting heterogeneous effects of
covariates on survival outcomes. To our knowledge, there is little work
available to draw inference on the effects of high dimensional predictors for
censored quantile regression. This paper proposes a novel procedure to draw
inference on all predictors within the framework of global censored quantile
regression, which investigates covariate-response associations over an interval
of quantile levels, instead of a few discrete values. The proposed estimator
combines a sequence of low dimensional model estimates that are based on
multi-sample splittings and variable selection. We show that, under some
regularity conditions, the estimator is consistent and asymptotically follows a
Gaussian process indexed by the quantile level. Simulation studies indicate
that our procedure can properly quantify the uncertainty of the estimates in
high dimensional settings. We apply our method to analyze the heterogeneous

Examples of such problems include optimizing the false negative rate at a fixed
false positive rate, optimizing precision at a fixed recall, optimizing the
area under the precision-recall or ROC curves, etc. Our key idea is to
formulate a rate-constrained optimization that expresses the threshold
parameter as a function of the model parameters via the Implicit Function
theorem. We show how the resulting optimization problem can be solved using
standard gradient based methods. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed method over existing state-of-the art
approaches for these problems. The code for the proposed method is available at

Chl-a (< 2 um). Whilst e,C was higher for warmer water samples, environmental
conditions alone explained less than 20% variance of e,C, and changes in
predominant size-fraction(s) distributions of Chl-a (biomass) failed to explain

the waiting list has being a major challenge in organ transplantation. Because
of the shortage, organ matching decision is the most critical decision to
assign the limited viable organs to the most suitable patients. Currently,
organ matching decisions were only made by matching scores calculated via
scoring models, which are built by the first principles. However, these models
may disagree with the actual post-transplantation matching performance (e.g.,
patient's post-transplant quality of life (QoL) or graft failure measurements).
In this paper, we formulate the organ matching decision-making as a top-N
recommendation problem and propose an Adaptively Weighted Top-N Recommendation
(AWTR) method. AWTR improves performance of the current scoring models by using
limited actual matching performance in historical data set as well as the
collected covariates from organ donors and patients. AWTR sacrifices the
overall recommendation accuracy by emphasizing the recommendation and ranking
accuracy for top-N matched patients. The proposed method is validated in a
simulation study, where KAS [60] is used to simulate the organ-patient
recommendation response. The results show that our proposed method outperforms
seven state-of-the-art top-N recommendation benchmark methods.

structures and irregular markings. This paper proposes an approach based on
semantic-particle filter to tackle the automatic lane-level mapping problem in

from online mapping database OpenStreetMap. Our proposed method then performs
semantic segmentation on 2D front-view images from ego vehicles and explores
the lane semantics on a birds-eye-view domain with true topographical

The proposed algorithm has been tested in densely urbanized areas, and the
results demonstrate accurate and robust reconstruction of the lane-level HD

when Cooper pairs are only weakly bound, the system enters the topological
phase via a second-order transition driven by increasing the Zeeman
spin-splitting energy. Stronger attractive two-particle interactions cause the

breaking near the limit of massless quarks (the chiral limit). In the physical
region (positive quark mass), we show that above a critical value of the
parameter $a_0$ the chiral condensate $\langle \bar{q} q \rangle$ is finite in
the chiral limit, signifying spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. This result
is supported by the lightest states arising in the spectrum of the pseudoscalar
mesons, which become massless in the chiral limit and are therefore intrepreted
as Nambu-Goldstone bosons. Moreover, the decay constants of the pseudoscalar
mesons also support this conclusion, as well as the Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner
(GOR) relation satisfied by the lightest states. We also calculate the spectrum
of scalar, vector, and axial-vector mesons with their corresponding decay
constants. We describe the evolution of masses and decay constants with the
increasing of the quark mass and for the physical mass we compare our results
against available experimental data. Finally, we do not find instabilities in
our model for the physical region (positive quark mass).

arbitrary human poses and transferring poses of one person to others. Though
many different methods have been proposed to generate images with high visual

pose ambiguity and appearance inconsistency. To alleviate the current
limitations and improve the quality of the synthesized images, we propose a
pose transfer network with augmented Disentangled Feature Consistency (DFC-Net)
to facilitate human pose transfer. Given a pair of images containing the source
and target person, DFC-Net extracts pose and static information from the source
and target respectively, then synthesizes an image of the target person with
the desired pose from the source. Moreover, DFC-Net leverages disentangled
feature consistency losses in the adversarial training to strengthen the
transfer coherence and integrates a keypoint amplifier to enhance the pose
feature extraction. With the help of the disentangled feature consistency
losses, we further propose a novel data augmentation scheme that introduces
unpaired support data with the augmented consistency constraints to improve the
generality and robustness of DFC-Net. Extensive experimental results on
Mixamo-Pose and EDN-10k have demonstrated DFC-Net achieves state-of-the-art
performance on pose transfer.

circuits and show an exponential separation between the sizes of symmetric

restriction is that the circuits which take a matrix input are unchanged by a
permutation applied simultaneously to the rows and columns of the matrix. Under
such restrictions we have polynomial-size circuits for computing the
determinant but no subexponential size circuits for the permanent. Here, we
consider a more stringent symmetry requirement, namely that the circuits are
unchanged by arbitrary even permutations applied separately to rows and

determinant. The result requires substantial new machinery. We develop a
general framework for proving lower bounds for symmetric circuits with
restricted symmetries, based on a new support theorem and new two-player
restricted bijection games. These are applied to the determinant problem with a
novel construction of matrices that are bi-adjacency matrices of graphs based
on the CFI construction. Our general framework opens the way to exploring a
variety of symmetry restrictions and studying trade-offs between symmetry and

uncertainty indicates whether a model's output should (or should not) be
trusted and thus becomes critical in real-world scenarios which typically
involves shifted input distributions due to many factors. Existing uncertainty

induce unreliable model predictions thus have higher uncertainty scores. They
quantify model uncertainty by calibrating DL model's confidence of a given

strong, broadened spectral lines of the neutral alkali metals (the potassium
doublet centered near 7682 Angstroms and the sodium doublet at 5893 Angstroms),
we see photometric variations that differ strikingly from the those of the

large spin-1/2 ensembles associated with nuclei bound in large molecule
structures, commonly referred to as the semi-solid spin pool, and their
magnetization transfer (MT) to spins of nuclei in
  Theory and Methods: Like quantum-mechanical descriptions of spin dynamics and
like the original Bloch equations, but unlike existing MT models, the proposed
model is based on the algebra of angular momentum in the sense that it
explicitly models the rotations induced by radio-frequency (RF) pulses. It
generalizes the original Bloch model to non-exponential decays, which are,
e.g., observed for semi-solid spin pools. The combination of rotations with
non-exponential decays is facilitated by describing the latter as Green's
functions, comprised in an integro-differential equation.
  Results: Our model describes the data of an inversion-recovery
magnetization-transfer experiment with varying durations of the inversion pulse
substantially better than established models. We made this observation for all
measured data, but in particular for pulse durations small than 300$\mu$s.
Furthermore, we provide a linear approximation of the generalized Bloch model
that reduces the simulation time by approximately a factor 15,000, enabling
simulation of the spin dynamics caused by a rectangular RF-pulse in roughly
2$\mu$s.
  Conclusion: The proposed theory unifies the original Bloch model, Henkelman's
steady-state theory for magnetization transfer, and the commonly assumed
rotation induced by hard pulses (i.e., strong and infinitesimally short
applications of RF fields) and describes experimental data better than previous
models.

decision making in healthcare. However, given the need for generalization over
complex state/action spaces, the incorporation of function approximators (e.g.,
deep neural networks) requires model selection to reduce overfitting and
improve policy performance at deployment. Yet a standard validation pipeline
for model selection requires running a learned policy in the actual
environment, which is often infeasible in a healthcare setting. In this work,
we investigate a model selection pipeline for offline RL that relies on
off-policy evaluation (OPE) as a proxy for validation performance. We present
an in-depth analysis of popular OPE methods, highlighting the additional
hyperparameters and computational requirements (fitting/inference of auxiliary
models) when used to rank a set of candidate policies. We compare the utility
of different OPE methods as part of the model selection pipeline in the context
of learning to treat patients with sepsis. Among all the OPE methods we
considered, fitted Q evaluation (FQE) consistently leads to the best validation
ranking, but at a high computational cost. To balance this trade-off between
accuracy of ranking and computational efficiency, we propose a simple two-stage
approach to accelerate model selection by avoiding potentially unnecessary
computation. Our work serves as a practical guide for offline RL model
selection and can help RL practitioners select policies using real-world
datasets. To facilitate reproducibility and future extensions, the code

period of approx. 58 min. Using multiwavelength observations of the system, we
discovered a dichotomy in the behavior of outbursts in AM CVns. The binary
showed an initial brightness increase which lasted for at least 82 days,
followed by an additional increase which lasted 2 weeks. Afterwards ASASSN-21au
went into superoutburst with a total duration of 19 days, showing an amplitude
with respect to quiescence of approx. 7.5 mags in g, with a precursor and an
echo outburst. A correlation between X-rays, UV and optical was identified for
the first time in an AM CVn during this stage. The color evolution of
ASASSN-21au indicates that during the superoutburst the dominant component was
the accretion disk. The short duration, large amplitude and color evolution of
the superoutburst agree with expectations from the disk instability model.
These characteristics are opposite to the ones observed in SDSS J080710+485259
and SDSS J113732+405458, which have periods of approx. 53 min and 60 min,
respectively. The initially slow brightness increase in the light curve of
ASASSN-21au and the behavior after the superoutburst favors a scenario in which
changes in the mass-transfer rate led to disk instabilities, while the outburst
mechanism of SDSS J080710+485259 and SDSS J113732+405458 has been attributed to
enhanced mass-transfer alone. Further observations are needed to understand the

leading to overfitting to specific settings. In this paper, a dynamic proximal

DPUNet can exploit both the embedded observation model via gradient descent and
imposed image priors by learned dynamic proximal operators, achieving joint
reconstruction. A key component of DPUNet is a dynamic proximal mapping module,
whose parameters can be dynamically adjusted at the inference stage and make it
adapt to different imaging settings. Experimental results demonstrate that the

hierarchical attention pipelines are constructed to generate point clouds that
accurately describe the incomplete images and then complete these point clouds
with high quality. Meanwhile, attention gate blocks (AGBs) are designed to
efficiently aggregate geometric local features of incomplete PCs transmitted by
hierarchical attention pipelines and internal features of reconstructing point
clouds. With the proposed HSPN, 3D shape perception and completion can be
achieved spontaneously. Comprehensive results measured by Chamfer distance and

outperforms other competitive methods in terms of qualitative displays,

natural indirect effect (NIE) and a natural direct effect (NDE), examples of
post-treatment confounding are abundant. Past research has generally considered
it infeasible to adjust for a post-treatment confounder of the mediator-outcome
relationship due to incomplete information: it is observed under the actual
treatment condition while missing under the counterfactual treatment condition.
This study proposes a new sensitivity analysis strategy for handling
post-treatment confounding and incorporates it into weighting-based causal
mediation analysis without making extra identification assumptions. Under the
sequential ignorability of the treatment assignment and of the mediator, we
obtain the conditional distribution of the post-treatment confounder under the
counterfactual treatment as a function of not just pretreatment covariates but
also its counterpart under the actual treatment. The sensitivity analysis then
generates a bound for the NIE and that for the NDE over a plausible range of
the conditional correlation between the post-treatment confounder under the
actual and that under the counterfactual conditions. Implemented through either
imputation or integration, the strategy is suitable for binary as well as
continuous measures of post-treatment confounders. Simulation results
demonstrate major strengths and potential limitations of this new solution. A
re-analysis of the National Evaluation of Welfare-to-Work Strategies (NEWWS)
Riverside data reveals that the initial analytic results are sensitive to
omitted post-treatment confounding.

the recently-proposed unpaired image-to-image translation between cell nuclei
images and randomly synthetic masks, existing approaches, e.g., CycleGAN, have
achieved encouraging results. However, these methods usually take a two-stage
pipeline and fail to learn end-to-end in cell nuclei images. More seriously,
they could lead to the lossy transformation problem, i.e., the content
inconsistency between the original images and the corresponding segmentation
output. To address these limitations, we propose a novel end-to-end
unsupervised framework called Aligned Disentangling Generative Adversarial
Network (AD-GAN). Distinctively, AD-GAN introduces representation
disentanglement to separate content representation (the underling spatial
structure) from style representation (the rendering of the structure). With
this framework, spatial structure can be preserved explicitly, enabling a
significant reduction of macro-level lossy transformation. We also propose a
novel training algorithm able to align the disentangled content in the latent
space to reduce micro-level lossy transformation. Evaluations on real-world 2D
and 3D datasets show that AD-GAN substantially outperforms the other comparison
methods and the professional software both quantitatively and qualitatively.
Specifically, the proposed AD-GAN leads to significant improvement over the
current best unsupervised methods by an average 17.8% relatively (w.r.t. the
metric DICE) on four cell nuclei datasets. As an unsupervised method, AD-GAN
even performs competitive with the best supervised models, taking a further
leap towards end-to-end unsupervised nuclei segmentation.

Taking advantage of lower potential-energy barriers in nanosystems, we have
systematically investigated the dynamics behavior of two nanoglasses, Al43 and
Al46. Structure transformation is identified in our pure molecular-dynamics
simulation far below Tg, which manifests the existence of metabasins in PELs,
at least for nanoglasses. Surprisingly, we find that the distribution of
potential energies shows a paired Gaussian and long-tailed distribution at
temperatures below and approaching Tg; correspondingly, the distribution of the
{\alpha}-relaxation time exhibits an exponential-like decay. In contrast to the
Gaussian distribution of energy in typical liquids and solids, the unexpected
distribution may reflect the intrinsic feature of nanoglasses. Associated with
the exponential-like distribution of the {\alpha}-relaxation time, the
stretched-exponential structural relaxation is found, and the maximum stretched

occupancy values have enabled high-fidelity implicit representations of object
shape. This paper develops a new shape model that allows synthesizing novel
distance views by optimizing a continuous signed directional distance function
(SDDF). Similar to deep SDF models, our SDDF formulation can represent whole
categories of shapes and complete or interpolate across shapes from partial
input data. Unlike an SDF, which measures distance to the nearest surface in
any direction, an SDDF measures distance in a given direction. This allows
training an SDDF model without 3D shape supervision, using only distance
measurements, readily available from depth camera or Lidar sensors. Our model
also removes post-processing steps like surface extraction or rendering by
directly predicting distance at arbitrary locations and viewing directions.
Unlike deep view-synthesis techniques, such as Neural Radiance Fields, which
train high-capacity black-box models, our model encodes by construction the
property that SDDF values decrease linearly along the viewing direction. This
structure constraint not only results in dimensionality reduction but also
provides analytical confidence about the accuracy of SDDF predictions,

reconstruction and perceptual quality by using generative adversarial networks.
However, the reconstruction loss and adversarial loss focus on synthesizing
contents of different frequencies and simply applying them together often leads
to inter-frequency conflicts and compromised inpainting. This paper presents
WaveFill, a wavelet-based inpainting network that decomposes images into
multiple frequency bands and fills the missing regions in each frequency band
separately and explicitly. WaveFill decomposes images by using discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) that preserves spatial information naturally. It applies L1
reconstruction loss to the decomposed low-frequency bands and adversarial loss
to high-frequency bands, hence effectively mitigate inter-frequency conflicts
while completing images in spatial domain. To address the inpainting
inconsistency in different frequency bands and fuse features with distinct
statistics, we design a novel normalization scheme that aligns and fuses the
multi-frequency features effectively. Extensive experiments over multiple
datasets show that WaveFill achieves superior image inpainting qualitatively
and quantitatively.

platoon system for the connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). First, a hybrid
spacing policy combining the constant time gap (CTG) and constant spacing (CS)
is formulated for the proposed platoon system, where the leader adopts the CTG
and the followers use the CS policy. Based on the h2-norm string stability
criteria, the notions of exogenous-head-to-tail string stability and hybrid
string stability are newly introduced, and the sufficient conditions of the
hybrid string stability in the frequency domain are derived using the Laplace
transform. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the hybrid string
stability. Moreover, two typical scenarios and several measurements of
effectiveness (MOE) are adopted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed
hybrid platoon system in various aspects. The results show that the hybrid
platoon system performs better than the CS-based platoon system. It also
indicates that the hybrid platoon system has obvious advantages over the
CTG-based platoon system under the periodical fluctuation scenario and it is
also comparable to the CTG-based platoon system under the large deceleration
and acceleration scenario. The findings have demonstrated the merits of the
combined implementation of CTG and CS policy in enhancing the performance and
applicability of the platoon system for CAVs.

Intermixing occurs predominantly between adjacent metallic layers. Notably, it
is stack-order dependent, and particularly extensive when Ir sits atop CoB.
Intermixing induced variations in magnetic properties are ascribed to the
formation of magnetic dead layer arising from CoIr alloying in the metallic
stacks. It also produces systematic variations in saturation magnetization, by
as much as 30%, across stacks. Crucially, the resulting crossover CoB thickness
for the transition from perpendicular to in-plane magnetic anisotropy differs
by more than 2x across the stacks. Finally, with thermal annealing treatment
over moderate temperatures of 150-300 degree Celsius, the magnetic anisotropy
increases monotonically across all stacks, coupled with discernibly larger Hc
for the metallic stacks. These are attributed to thermally induced CoPt
alloying and MgO crystallization in the metallic and oxide stacks,
respectively. Remarkably, the CoB in the Pt/CoB/MgO stacks retains its
amorphous nature after annealing. Our results set the stage for harnessing the
collective attributes of amorphous CoB-based material platforms and associated

Sun, which is referred to as solar irradiance, or total solar irradiance (TSI)
when all of the radiation is measured. A minor change in the solar irradiance
can have a significant impact on the Earth's climate and atmosphere. As a
result, studying and measuring solar irradiance is crucial in understanding
climate changes and solar variability. Several methods have been developed to
reconstruct total solar irradiance for long and short periods of time; however,
they are physics-based and rely on the availability of data, which does not go
beyond 9,000 years. In this paper we propose a new method, called TSInet, to
reconstruct total solar irradiance by deep learning for short and long periods
of time that span beyond the physical models' data availability. On the data
that are available, our method agrees well with the state-of-the-art
physics-based reconstruction models. To our knowledge, this is the first time
that deep learning has been used to reconstruct total solar irradiance for more
than 9,000 years.

awareness for the first time in the literature. We construct a series of deep
learning frameworks built on top of one another to enhance the safety,
efficiency, and successful completion of rescue missions conducted by
firefighters in emergency first response settings. First, we used a deep
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) system to classify and identify objects of
interest from thermal imagery in real-time. Next, we extended this CNN
framework for object detection, tracking, segmentation with a Mask RCNN
framework, and scene description with a multimodal natural language
processing(NLP) framework. Third, we built a deep Q-learning-based agent,
immune to stress-induced disorientation and anxiety, capable of making clear
navigation decisions based on the observed and stored facts in live-fire
environments. Finally, we used a low computational unsupervised learning
technique called tensor decomposition to perform meaningful feature extraction
for anomaly detection in real-time. With these ad-hoc deep learning structures,
we built the artificial intelligence system's backbone for firefighters'
situational awareness. To bring the designed system into usage by firefighters,
we designed a physical structure where the processed results are used as inputs
in the creation of an augmented reality capable of advising firefighters of
their location and key features around them, which are vital to the rescue
operation at hand, as well as a path planning feature that acts as a virtual
guide to assist disoriented first responders in getting back to safety. When
combined, these four approaches present a novel approach to information
understanding, transfer, and synthesis that could dramatically improve
firefighter response and efficacy and reduce life loss.

Fourier space and is obtained from approximate solutions to the Navier--Stokes

important physical properties such as mass conservation and a realistic energy
cascade. The DRD model can be calibrated with noisy data from field
experiments. After calibration, the model can be used to generate synthetic

on domain decomposition which delivers scalable, memory-efficient turbulence

relates the alloy's electrical resistivity to the relative proportions of the
three main structural phases namely Martensite, Austenite and R-phase,
experimentally known to exist in NiTi alloy lattice structure. The relative
proportions of the phases depend on temperature and applied stress. Temperature
varies due to the self-heating of the filament by the Joule effect when a
current pulse passes and also due to convective/radiative interchange with the
ambient. The temperature variation with time causes structural phase
transitions, which result in abrupt changes in the sample resistivity as the
proportions of each lattice phase vary. The model is described by a system of
four 1st-order nonlinear differential-algebraic equations yielding the temporal
evolution of resistivity and output voltage across the filament for any given
time-varying input current pulse. The model corresponds to a 4th-order extended
memristor, described by four state variables, which are the proportions of each
of the three NiTi lattice phases and temperature. Simulations are

  Facial Expression Recognition",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  By utilizing label distribution learning, a probability distribution is
assigned for a facial image to express a compound emotion, which effectively
improves the problem of label uncertainties and noises occurred in one-hot
labels. In practice, it is observed that correlations among emotions are
inherently different, such as surprised and happy emotions are more possibly
synchronized than surprised and neutral. It indicates the correlation may be
crucial for obtaining a reliable label distribution. Based on this, we propose
a new method that amends the label distribution of each facial image by
leveraging correlations among expressions in the semantic space. Inspired by
inherently diverse correlations among word2vecs, the topological information
among facial expressions is firstly explored in the semantic space, and each
image is embedded into the semantic space. Specially, a class-relation graph is
constructed to transfer the semantic correlation among expressions into the
task space. By comparing semantic and task class-relation graphs of each image,
the confidence of its label distribution is evaluated. Based on the confidence,
the label distribution is amended by enhancing samples with higher confidence
and weakening samples with lower confidence. Experimental results demonstrate
the proposed method is more effective than compared state-of-the-art methods.

onsets above and below 65$^{\circ}$magnetic latitude, which display different

onsets develop a poleward-expanding auroral bulge, and identify these as
substorms that manifest ionospheric convection-braking in the auroral bulge
region as suggested by Grocott et al. (2009,
https://doi.org/10.5194/angeo-27-591-2009). We show that the high-latitude
substorms, which do not experience braking, can evolve into SMC events if the
interplanetary magnetic field remains southward for a prolonged period
following onset. We conclude that during periods of ongoing driving, the
magnetosphere displays repeated substorm activity or SMC depending on the rate
of driving and the open magnetic flux content of the magnetosphere prior to
onset. We speculate that sawtooth events are an extreme case of repeated onsets
and that substorms triggered by northward-turnings of the interplanetary
magnetic field mark the cessation of periods of SMC. Our results provide a new
explanation for the differing modes of response of the terrestrial system to
solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling by invoking friction between the

fraction of dark energy follows the dominant component in previous epochs of
the expansion, or phase transitions may happen close to matter-radiation
equality time. A non-negligible early dark energy (EDE) fraction around
matter-radiation equality could contribute to alleviate the $H_0$ tension. We
constrain the EDE fraction using two approaches: first, we use a fluid
parameterization that mimics the plateaux of the dominant components in the
past. An alternative tomographic approach constrains the EDE density in binned
redshift intervals. This allows us to reconstruct $\Omega_{de}(z)$ before and
after the decoupling of the CMB photons. We have employed Planck data 2018, the
Pantheon supernovae of Type Ia (SNIa), galaxy clustering data, the prior on the
absolute magnitude of SNIa by SH0ES, and weak lensing (WL) data from
KiDS+VIKING-450 and DES-Y1. When we use a minimal parameterization mimicking
the background plateaux, EDE has only a small impact on current cosmological
tensions. The constraints on the EDE fraction weaken considerably when its
sound speed is allowed to vary. By means of our binned analysis we put very
tight constraints on the EDE fraction around the CMB decoupling time, $\lesssim
0.4\%$ at $2\sigma$ c.l. We confirm previous results that a significant EDE
fraction in the radiation-dominated epoch (RDE) loosens the $H_0$ tension, but
tends to worsen the $\sigma_8$ one. The presence of EDE in the matter-dominated
era helps to alleviate this issue. When the SH0ES prior and WL data are
considered in the fitting analysis in combination with data from CMB, SNIa and
baryon acoustic oscillations, the EDE fractions are constrained to be $\lesssim
2.6\%$ in the RDE epoch and $\lesssim 1.5\%$ in the redshift range $z\in

tailored to the macroscale simulation of metal additive manufacturing processes
such as selective laser melting. A first focus lies on the derivation of a
consistent constitutive law on basis of a Voigt-type spatial homogenization
procedure across the relevant phases, powder, melt and solid. The proposed
constitutive law accounts for the irreversibility of phase change and
consistently represents thermally induced residual stresses. In particular, the
incorporation of a reference strain term, formulated in rate form, allows to
consistently enforce a stress-free configuration for newly solidifying material
at melt temperature. Application to elementary test cases demonstrates the
validity of the proposed constitutive law and allows for a comparison with
analytical and reference solutions. Moreover, these elementary solidification
scenarios give detailed insights and foster understanding of basic mechanisms
of residual stress generation in melting and solidification problems with
localized, moving heat sources. As a second methodological aspect, dual mortar
mesh tying strategies are proposed for the coupling of successively applied
powder layers. This approach allows for very flexible mesh generation for
complex geometries. As compared to collocation-type coupling schemes, e.g.,
based on hanging nodes, these mortar methods enforce the coupling conditions
between non-matching meshes in an $L^2$-optimal manner. The combination of the
proposed constitutive law and mortar mesh tying approach is validated on
realistic three-dimensional examples, representing a first step towards
part-scale predictions.

individual level underpinnings of this collective regulation have remained
unclear mainly due to difficulties in measuring food within ants crops. Here we
image fluorescent liquid food in individually tagged Camponotus sanctus ants,
and track the real-time food flow from foragers to their gradually satiating
colonies. We show how the feedback between colony satiation level and food
inflow is mediated by individual crop loads; specifically, the crop loads of
recipient ants control food flow rates, while those of foragers regulate the
frequency of foraging trips. Interestingly, these effects do not rise from pure
physical limitations of crop capacity. Our findings suggest that the emergence

to access the properties of two-neutron halo nuclei. Recently, experimental
results for the average opening angle as a function of the intrinsic neutron
momentum in 11Li have shown a localization of dineutron correlations on the
nucleus surface.
  Purpose. Study the model dependence and the effect of distortion and
absorption on the opening angle distributions to assess the reliability of this
observable to extract properties of Borromean two-neutron halo nuclei.
  Method. A quasifree sudden model is used to describe the knockout process,
where absorption effects are modeled by the eikonal S-matrix between the proton
target and the core of the Borromean nucleus. Final states in momentum space
are built within a three-body model for the projectile, which enables the
description of momenta and opening angle distributions.
  Results. A strong dependence on absorption effects is found for the opening
angle at large intrinsic momenta, while the region of lower momenta is mostly
insensitive to them. Reasonable agreement with the available data is obtained
for 11Li at low momenta with weights for s and p waves different from those
previously reported, showing a model dependence in their extraction. For 19B,
test calculations show marked sensitivity to small p-wave components.
  Conclusions. The opening angle for (p,pn) knockout reactions on Borromean
nuclei at small intrinsic momenta is a reliable observable mostly sensitive to
the structure of the Borromean nucleus. For larger momenta, the reaction
mechanism leads to a larger distortion of the distribution. In the case of
nuclei with small components of opposite parity to the dominant ones, this
observable can be used to explore them. The relation between dineutron in
coordinate space and opening angle in momentum space is found to be
model-dependent.

networks. It links the data from separate sources and is widely studied in
bioinformation and social network fields. The critical difference between
network alignment and exact graph matching is that the network alignment
considers node mapping in non-isomorphic graphs with error tolerance.
Researchers usually utilize AC (accuracy) to measure the performance of network
alignments which comparing each output element with the benchmark directly.
However, this metric neglects that some nodes are naturally indistinguishable
even in single graphs (e.g., nodes have the same neighbors) and no need to
distinguish across graphs. Such neglect leads to the underestimation of models.
We propose an unbiased metric for network alignment that takes
indistinguishable nodes into consideration to address this problem. Our
detailed experiments with different scales on both synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate that the proposed metric correctly reflects the deviation
of result mapping from benchmark mapping as standard metric AC does. Comparing
with the AC, the proposed metric effectively blocks the effect of
indistinguishable nodes and retains stability under increasing
indistinguishable nodes.

we consider the game of Nowak and May, based on the Prisoner's dilemma, and
augment the game rules by a self-consistent mean-field term. This way, an agent
operates based on local information from its neighbors and nonlocal information
via the mean-field coupling. We simulate the model and construct the
steady-state phase diagram, which shows significant new features due to the
mean-field term: while for the game of Nowak and May, steady states are
characterized by a constant mean density of cooperators, the mean-field game
contains steady states with a continuous dependence of the density on the
payoff parameter. Moreover, the mean-field term changes the nature of
transitions from discontinuous jumps in the steady-state density to jumps in
the first derivative. The main effects are observed for stationary steady
states, which are parametrically close to chaotic states: the mean-field
coupling drives such stationary states into spatial chaos. Our approach can be
readily generalized to a broad class of spatial evolutionary games with
deterministic and stochastic decision rules.

domain shifts. In addition, there are new instruments and variations in
surgical tissues appeared in robotic surgery. In this work, we propose
class-incremental domain adaptation (CIDA) with a multi-layer transformer-based
model to tackle the new classes and domain shift in the target domain to
generate surgical reports during robotic surgery. To adapt incremental classes
and extract domain invariant features, a class-incremental (CI) learning method
with supervised contrastive (SupCon) loss is incorporated with a feature
extractor. To generate caption from the extracted feature, curriculum by
one-dimensional gaussian smoothing (CBS) is integrated with a multi-layer
transformer-based caption prediction model. CBS smoothes the features embedding
using anti-aliasing and helps the model to learn domain invariant features. We
also adopt label smoothing (LS) to calibrate prediction probability and obtain
better feature representation with both feature extractor and captioning model.
The proposed techniques are empirically evaluated by using the datasets of two
surgical domains, such as nephrectomy operations and transoral robotic surgery.
We observe that domain invariant feature learning and the well-calibrated
network improves the surgical report generation performance in both source and
target domain under domain shift and unseen classes in the manners of one-shot

elastocaloric cooling, but their cyclic stability suffers severely from
functional degradation. Herein, we investigate the functional degradation of
nanocrystalline NiTi tubes via in-depth analysis and find out that it is
beneficial to elastocaloric cooling performance. The results show that the
functional degradation accompanies with progressive accumulation of residual
strain and significant reduction in both hysteresis loop area (D) and forward
transformation stress. The accumulation of residual strain arises from
phase-transition-induced dislocations and dislocation-pinned residual
martensite. The former separates the original austenite grains to much smaller
nanodomains (equivalent to grain size effect) and contributes to the strain
hardening during phase transition, leading to the significant reduction of D.
The latter induces compressive residual stress in the austenite phase and thus
gives rise to the evolutive reduction of forward transformation stress.
Consequently, the material coefficient of performance (COPmater) was
self-enhanced for 40~104 %. The beneficial effect is mainly because of the
cyclically-decreased D. The study might provide a processing route to tailor
COPmater and stabilize the mechanical response of NiTi by cyclic compression.

loading modes: plane-strain loading and uni-axial loading, and two models of
magneto-sensitive plates: the neo-Hookean ideal magneto-elastic model and the
neo-Hookean magnetization saturation Langevin model. Our analysis relies on the
theory of nonlinear magneto-elasticity and the associated linearized theory for
superimposed perturbations. We derive the Stroh formulation of the governing
equations of wrinkling, and combine it with the surface impedance method to
obtain explicitly the bifurcation equations identifying the onset of symmetric

instability in the thin- and thick-plate limits. For thin plates, we make the
link with classical Euler buckling solutions. We also perform an exhaustive
numerical analysis to elucidate the effects of loading mode, load amplitude,
and saturation magnetization on the nonlinear static response and bifurcation
diagrams. We find that antisymmetric wrinkling modes always occur before
symmetric modes. Increasing the pre-compression or heightening the magnetic

parity-odd interaction between moving polarized electrons and unpolarized
nucleons using a magnetic force microscope. The polarized electrons are
provided by the magnetic tip at the end of a silicon cantilever, and their
polarizations are approximately magnetized in the plane of the magnetic coating
on the tip. A periodic structure with alternative gold and silicon dioxide
stripes provides unpolarized nucleons with periodic number density modulation.
The exotic forces are expected to change the oscillation amplitude of the
cantilever which is measured by a fiber laser interferometer. Data has been
taken by scanning the tip over the nucleon source structure at constant
separation, and no exotic signal related to the density modulation has been
observed. Thus, the experiment sets a limit on the electron-nucleon coupling
constant, $g_A^eg_V^N\leq 9\times 10^{-15}$ for 15 $\mu$m $\le \lambda \le$ 180
$\mu$m, using a direct force measurement method.

hardware technology, implementing shallow neural networks on the so-called
Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices has attracted a lot of
interest. Many quantum (convolutional) circuit ansaetze are proposed for
grayscale images classification tasks with promising empirical results.
However, when applying these ansaetze on RGB images, the intra-channel
information that is useful for vision tasks is not extracted effectively. In
this paper, we propose two types of quantum circuit ansaetze to simulate
convolution operations on RGB images, which differ in the way how inter-channel
and intra-channel information are extracted. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work of a quantum convolutional circuit to deal with RGB images
effectively, with a higher test accuracy compared to the purely classical CNNs.
We also investigate the relationship between the size of quantum circuit ansatz
and the learnability of the hybrid quantum-classical convolutional neural
network. Through experiments based on CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets, we
demonstrate that a larger size of the quantum circuit ansatz improves
predictive performance in multiclass classification tasks, providing useful
insights for near term quantum algorithm developments.

show that combining different technologies for the discretization of the
velocity space and of the physical space coupled with suitable time integration
techniques, it is possible to compute very precise deterministic approximate
solutions of the Boltzmann model in different regimes, from extremely rarefied
to dense fluids, with CFL conditions only driven by the hyperbolic transport
term. To that aim, we develop modal Discontinuous Galerkin (DG)
Implicit-Explicit Runge Kutta schemes (DG-IMEX-RK) and Implicit-Explicit Linear
Multistep Methods based on Backward-Finite-Differences (DG-IMEX-BDF) for
solving the Boltzmann model on multidimensional unstructured meshes. The
solution of the Boltzmann collision operator is obtained through fast spectral
methods, while the transport term in the governing equations is discretized
relying on an explicit shock-capturing DG method on polygonal tessellations in
the physical space. A novel class of WENO-type limiters, based on a shifting of
the moments of inertia for each zone of the mesh, is used to control spurious
oscillations of the DG solution across discontinuities. The order of
convergence is numerically measured for different regimes and found to agree
with the theoretical findings. The new methods are validated considering
two-dimensional benchmark test cases typically used in the fluid dynamics

presence of inversion symmetry, the energy bands are degenerate and the nodal
lines on the fixed plane may hybridize or may cross. In the former case, the
crossing is avoided, thus producing lines on reciprocal space where the energy
gap is small, and in the latter, the nodal lines will endure, thus producing
Dirac or double nodal lines. In addition, if the material crystallizes in a
ferromagnetic phase where the glide reflection symmetry is broken, the nodal
lines hybridize, thus defining lines in reciprocal space where the energy gap
is small. In this work we concentrate our efforts on the study of nodal lines
that hybridize due to magnetization; we have coined the term of quasi-nodal

enriched Gent material model is employed to account for the effects of strain
stiffening and electrostriction of the DE laminate. The theory of nonlinear
electroelasticity and related linearized incremental theory are exploited to
derive the governing equations of nonlinear response and the dispersion
relations of incremental shear and longitudinal waves. Numerical results reveal
that the snap-through instability of a Gent DE laminate resulting from
geometrical and material nonlinearities can be used to achieve a sharp
transition in the position and width of wave band gaps. Furthermore, the
influence of material properties (including Gent constants, the second strain
invariant and electrostrictive parameters) and that of prestress on the
snap-through instability and the electrostatic tunability of band gaps for both
shear and longitudinal waves are discussed in detail. The electrostrictive
effect and prestress are beneficial to stabilizing the periodic DE laminate.
Depending on whether the snap-through instability occurs or not, a continuous
variation or a sharp transition in wave band gaps can be realized by varying
the electric stimuli. Our numerical findings are expected to provide a solid
guidance for the design and manufacture of soft DE wave devices with tunable
band structures.

correct the error of a knowledge-based model. The resulting surrogate model is
hybrid, with a statistical part supplementing a physical part. In practice, the
correction can be added as an integrated term (i.e. in the model resolvent) or
directly inside the tendencies of the physical model. The resolvent correction
is easy to implement. The tendency correction is more technical, in particular
it requires the adjoint of the physical model, but also more flexible. We use
the two-scale Lorenz model to compare the two methods. The accuracy in
long-range forecast experiments is somewhat similar between the surrogate
models using the resolvent correction and the tendency correction. By contrast,
the surrogate models using the tendency correction significantly outperform the
surrogate models using the resolvent correction in data assimilation

either mechanical or electrical stimulus, and hence they can be excellent
candidates for designing extremely flexible and adaptive structures and
devices. This paper proposes a simple one-dimensional soft phononic crystal
cylinder made of dielectric elastomer to show how large deformation and
electric field can be used jointly to tune the longitudinal waves propagating
in the PC. A series of soft electrodes are placed periodically along the
dielectric elastomer cylinder, and hence the material can be regarded as
uniform in the undeformed state. This is also the case for the uniformly
pre-stretched state induced by a static axial force only. The effective
periodicity of the structure is then achieved through two loading paths, i.e.
by maintaining the longitudinal stretch and applying an electric voltage over
any two neighbouring electrodes, or by holding the axial force and applying the
voltage. All physical field variables for both configurations can be determined
exactly based on the nonlinear theory of electroelasticity. An infinitesimal
wave motion is further superimposed on the pre-deformed configurations and the
corresponding dispersion equations are derived analytically by invoking the
linearized theory for incremental motions. Numerical examples are finally
considered to show the tunability of wave propagation behavior in the soft PC
cylinder. The outstanding performance regarding the band gap (BG) property of
the proposed soft dielectric PC is clearly demonstrated by comparing with the
conventional design adopting the hard piezoelectric material. Note that soft
dielectric PCs are susceptible to various kinds of failure (buckling,
electromechanical instability, electric breakdown, etc.), imposing
corresponding limits on the external stimuli.

photosphere, around the magnetically sensitive Cr I lines at 5780.9, 5781.1,
5781.7, 5783.0, and 5783.8 \r{A}, with Land\'e g-factors between 1.6 and 2.5,
is explored. The goal is to analyze simultaneously 15 spectral lines, which
comprise Cr I, Cu I, Fe I, Mn I, and Si I lines, without polarimetry to infer
the thermodynamic and magnetic properties in strongly magnetized plasmas using
an inversion code. The study is based on a new setup at the Vacuum Tower
Telescope (VTT, Tenerife) which includes fast spectroscopic scans in the
wavelength range around the Cr I 5781.75 \r{A} line. The snapshot 385 of the
Enhanced Network simulation from the Bifrost code serves to synthesize all the
lines, which are in turn inverted simultaneously with SIR to establish the best
inversion strategy. This strategy is then applied to VTT observations of a
sunspot belonging to NOAA 12723 on 2018 September 30 and the results are
compared to full-disk vector-field data obtained with the Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager (HMI). The 15 simultaneously inverted intensity profiles
(Stokes I) delivered accurate temperatures and Doppler velocities when compared
against the simulations. The derived magnetic fields and inclinations are most
accurate when the fields are oriented along the line-of-sight (LOS) and less
accurate when the fields are transverse to the LOS. In general, the results
appear similar to the HMI vector-field data, although some discrepancies exist.
The analyzed spectral range has the potential to deliver thermal, dynamic, and
magnetic information in strongly magnetized features on the Sun, such as pores
and sunspots, even without polarimetry. The highest sensitivity of the lines is
found in the lower photosphere, on average around $\log \tau = -1$. The
multiple-line inversions provide smooth results across the whole field-of-view.

the molecularization effects in different semiconductor materials and discuss
how they specifically hamper Pauli spin blockade readout and reduce the

sound generation, noise control, vibration isolation and damping. In this
paper, we propose to exploit the biasing fields (induced by internal pressure
and radial electric voltage) to tune the three-dimensional and small-amplitude
free vibration of a thick-walled soft electro-active (SEA) spherical balloon.
The incompressible isotropic SEA balloon is characterized by both neo-Hookean
and Gent ideal dielectric models. The equations governing small-amplitude
vibrations under inhomogeneous biasing fields can be linearized and solved in
spherical coordinates using the state-space formalism, which establishes two
separate transfer relations correlating the state vectors at the inner surface
with those at the outer surface of the SEA balloon. By imposing the mechanical
and electric boundary conditions, two separate analytical frequency equations
are derived, which characterize two independent classes of vibration for
torsional and spheroidal modes, respectively. Numerical examples are finally
conducted to validate the theoretical derivation as well as to investigate the
effects of both radial electric voltage and internal pressure on the resonant
frequency of the SEA balloon. The reported analytical solution is truly and
fully three-dimensional, covering from the purely radial breathing mode to
torsional mode to any general spheroidal mode, and hence provides a more
accurate prediction of the vibration characteristics of tunable resonant
devices that incorporate the SEA spherical balloon as the tuning element.

specific applications. In this paper, we analyze the axisymmetric guided wave
propagation in a pressurized FG elastomeric hollow cylinder. The cylinder is
subjected to a combined action of axial pre-stretch and pressure difference
applied to the inner and outer cylindrical surfaces. We consider both torsional
waves and longitudinal waves propagating in the FG cylinder made of
incompressible isotropic elastomer, which is characterized by the Mooney-Rivlin
strain energy function but with the material parameters varying with the radial
coordinate in an affine way. The pressure difference generates an inhomogeneous
deformation field in the FG cylinder, which dramatically complicates the
superimposed wave problem described by the small-on-large theory. A
particularly efficient approach is hence employed which combines the
state-space formalism for the incremental wave motion with the approximate
laminate or multi-layer technique. Dispersion relations for the two types of
axisymmetric guided waves are then derived analytically. The accuracy and
convergence of the proposed approach is validated numerically. The effects of
the pressure difference, material gradient, and axial pre-stretch on both the
torsional and the longitudinal wave propagation characteristics are discussed
in detail through numerical examples. It is found that the frequency of
axisymmetric waves depends nonlinearly on the pressure difference and the
material gradient, and an increase in the material gradient enhances the
capability of the pressure difference to adjust the wave behavior in the FG
cylinder.

the astrochemical literature. To fill up this gap, we have carried out new
accurate quantum chemical calculations to identify the structures and energies
of 262 cations with up to 14 atoms that are postulated to have a role in the
interstellar chemistry. Optimised structures and rotational constants were
obtained at M06-2X/cc-pVTZ level, while electric dipoles and total electronic
energies were computed with CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ//M06-2X/cc-pVTZ single point
energy calculations. The present work complements the study by Woon & Herbst
(2009), who characterised the structure and energies of 200 neutral species
involved as well in the interstellar chemistry. Taken together, the two
datasets can be used to estimate whether a reaction, postulated in present
astrochemical reaction networks, is feasible from a thermochemistry point of
view and, consequently, to improve the reliability of the present networks used
to simulate the interstellar chemistry. We provide an actual example of the
potential use of the cations plus neutral datasets. It shows that two
reactions, involving Si-bearing ions and present in the widely used reaction
networks KIDA and UMIST, cannot occur in cold ISM because endothermic.

fractional rms amplitude in different energy bands to study the variability.
The broad-band 0.5-70 keV spectra are fitted with phenomenological models, as
well as physical models. A strong soft X-ray excess is detected in the spectra
during the outburst. The soft excess emission is found to be complex and could
originate in the warm Comptonizing region in the inner accretion disc. We find
that the increase in the accretion rate is responsible for the sudden rise in
luminosity. This is supported by the q-shape of the hardness-intensity diagram

  Heavy-tailed Data",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  As one of the most fundamental problems in machine learning, statistics and
differential privacy, Differentially Private Stochastic Convex Optimization
(DP-SCO) has been extensively studied in recent years. However, most of the
previous work can only handle either regular data distribution or irregular
data in the low dimensional space case. To better understand the challenges
arising from irregular data distribution, in this paper we provide the first
study on the problem of DP-SCO with heavy-tailed data in the high dimensional
space. In the first part we focus on the problem over some polytope constraint
(such as the $\ell_1$-norm ball). We show that if the loss function is smooth
and its gradient has bounded second order moment, it is possible to get a (high
probability) error bound (excess population risk) of $\tilde{O}(\frac{\log
d}{(n\epsilon)^\frac{1}{3}})$ in the $\epsilon$-DP model, where $n$ is the
sample size and $d$ is the dimensionality of the underlying space. Next, for
LASSO, if the data distribution that has bounded fourth-order moments, we
improve the bound to $\tilde{O}(\frac{\log d}{(n\epsilon)^\frac{2}{5}})$ in the
$(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP model. In the second part of the paper, we study sparse
learning with heavy-tailed data. We first revisit the sparse linear model and
propose a truncated DP-IHT method whose output could achieve an error of
$\tilde{O}(\frac{s^{*2}\log d}{n\epsilon})$, where $s^*$ is the sparsity of the
underlying parameter. Then we study a more general problem over the sparsity
({\em i.e.,} $\ell_0$-norm) constraint, and show that it is possible to achieve
an error of $\tilde{O}(\frac{s^{*\frac{3}{2}}\log d}{n\epsilon})$, which is
also near optimal up to a factor of $\tilde{O}{(\sqrt{s^*})}$, if the loss
function is smooth and strongly convex.

Presently, revamped interest in anode materials is observed -- primarily
graphite electrodes for lithium-ion batteries. Here, we focus on the upper
limit of lithium intercalation in the morphologically quasi-ideal highly
oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG), with a LiC$_6$ stoichiometry corresponding
to 100\% state of charge (SOC). We prepared a sample by immersion in liquid
lithium at ambient pressure and investigated it by static $^7$Li nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR). We resolved unexpected signatures of superdense
intercalation compounds, LiC$_{6-x}$. These have been ruled out for decades,
since the highest geometrically accessible composition, LiC$_2$, can only be
prepared under high pressure. We thus challenge the widespread notion that any
additional intercalation beyond LiC$_6$ is not possible under ambient
conditions. We monitored the sample upon calendaric aging and employed ab
initio calculations to rationalise the NMR results. The computed relative
stabilities of different superdense configurations reveal that non-negligible
overintercalation does proceed spontaneously beyond the currently accepted
capacity limit.

replication protocol that achieves a performance comparable to non-replicated
systems in realistic environments. A reason for such high performance is the
set of optimizations introduced in the protocol. One of these optimizations is
read-only requests, a particular type of client request which avoids running
the three-step agreement protocol and allows replicas to respond directly, thus
reducing the latency of reads from five to two communication steps. Given
PBFT's broad influence, its design and optimizations influenced many BFT
protocols and systems that followed, e.g., BFT-SMaRt. We show, for the first
time, that the read-only request optimization introduced in PBFT more than 20
years ago can violate its liveness. Notably, the problem affects not only the
optimized read-only operations but also standard, totally-ordered operations.
We show this weakness by presenting an attack in which a malicious leader
blocks correct clients and present two solutions for patching the protocol,
making read-only operations fast and correct. The two solutions were
implemented on BFT-SMaRt and evaluated in different scenarios, showing their
effectiveness in preventing the identified attack.

simulations is a common technique for learning about energy deposition and
atmospheric evolution during these explosive events. A frequent spectral line
choice for this process is Ca II 854.2 nm due to its formation in the
chromosphere and substantial variability. It is important to ensure that this
line is accurately modeled to obtain the correct interpretation of
observations. Here we investigate the importance of photoionisation of Ca II to
Ca III by the hydrogen Lyman transitions; whilst the Lyman continuum is
typically considered in this context in simulations, the associated bound-bound
transitions are not. This investigation uses two RADYN flare simulations and
reprocesses the radiative transfer using the Lightweaver framework which
accounts for the overlapping of all active transitions. The Ca II 854.2 nm line
profiles are found to vary significantly due to photoionisation by the Lyman
lines, showing notably different shapes and even reversed asymmetries. Finally,
we investigate to what extent these effects modify the energy balance of the
simulation and the implications on future radiation-hydrodynamic simulations.
There is found to be a 10-15% change in detailed optically thick radiative
losses from considering these photoionisation effects on the calcium lines in
the two simulations presented, demonstrating the importance of considering
these effects in a self-consistent way.

possibility of achieving a directional-dependent two-phase flow behaviour
during the process of invasion of a viscous fluid into anisotropic porous media
with controlled design. By customising the pore-scale morphology and
heterogeneities with the adoption of anisotropic triangular pillars distributed
with quenched disorder, we observe a substantially different invasion dynamics
according to the direction of fluid injection relative to the medium
orientation, that is depending if the triangular pillars have their apex
oriented (flow-aligned) or opposed (flow-opposing) to the main flow direction.
Three flow regimes can be observed: (i) for low values of the ratio between the
macroscopic pressure drop and the characteristic pore-scale capillary
threshold, i.e. for p0/pc < 1, the fluid invasion dynamics is strongly impeded
and the viscous fluid is unable to reach the outlet of the medium, irrespective
of the direction of injection; (ii) for intermediate values, 1 < p0/pc < 2, the
viscous fluid reaches the outlet only when the triangular pillars are
flow-opposing oriented; (iii) for larger values, i.e for p0/pc > 2, the outlet
is again reached irrespective of the direction of injection. The porous medium
anisotropy induces a lower effective resistance when the pillars are
flow-opposing oriented, suppressing front roughening and capillary fingering.
We thus argue that the invasion process occurs as long as the pressure drop is
larger then the macroscopic capillary pressure determined by the front
roughness, which in the case of flow-opposing pillars is halved.

proposed, which enforces both positional and rotational constraints. Since
Boltzmann continua exhibit no inherent rotational degrees of freedom, suitable
definitions of orthonormal triads are investigated that are representative for
the orientation of material directions in the 3D solid. The rotation tensor
defined by the polar decomposition of the deformation gradient is demonstrated
to represent these material directions in a L2-optimal manner. Subsequently,
objective rotational coupling constraints between beam and solid are formulated
and enforced in a variationally consistent framework. Eventually, finite
element discretization of all primary fields results in an embedded mortar
formulation for rotational and translational constraint enforcement. Based on
carefully chosen numerical test cases, the proposed scheme is demonstrated to
exhibit a consistent spatial convergence behavior and to offer the up-scaling

  horseshoe prior",,,,,"stat.ME cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Identification of the so-called dynamic networks is one of the most
challenging problems appeared recently in control literature. Such systems
consist of large-scale interconnected systems, also called modules. To recover
full networks dynamics the two crucial steps are topology detection, where one
has to infer from data which connections are active, and modules estimation.
Since a small percentage of connections are effective in many real systems, the
problem finds also fundamental connections with group-sparse estimation. In
particular, in the linear setting modules correspond to unknown impulse
responses expected to have null norm but in a small fraction of samples. This
paper introduces a new Bayesian approach for linear dynamic networks
identification where impulse responses are described through the combination of
two particular prior distributions. The first one is a block version of the
horseshoe prior, a model possessing important global-local shrinkage features.
The second one is the stable spline prior, that encodes information on
smooth-exponential decay of the modules. The resulting model is called stable
spline horseshoe (SSH) prior. It implements aggressive shrinkage of small
impulse responses while larger impulse responses are conveniently subject to
stable spline regularization. Inference is performed by a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo scheme, tailored to the dynamic context and able to efficiently return
the posterior of the modules in sampled form. We include numerical studies that
show how the new approach can accurately reconstruct sparse networks dynamics
also when thousands of unknown impulse response coefficients must be inferred
from data sets of relatively small size.

computer vision. Recently, deep learning models have achieved great progress
towards learning discriminative features from input images. However,
conventional approaches are unable to model the inter-class discrepancies among
features in multi-label images, since they are designed to work for image-level
feature discrimination. In this paper, we propose a unified deep network to
learn discriminative features for the multi-label task. Given a multi-label
image, the proposed method first disentangles features corresponding to
different classes. Then, it discriminates between these classes via increasing
the inter-class distance while decreasing the intra-class differences in the
output space. By regularizing the whole network with the proposed loss, the
performance of applying the wellknown ResNet-101 is improved significantly.
Extensive experiments have been performed on COCO-2014, VOC2007 and VOC2012

intense interests in exploring new phenomena that have no counterparts in

Here, we experimentally realized topological parametric lasers based on

with their neighbors to exchange and aggregate their local beliefs about the
hidden state through a distributed Kalman filter. We show that the proposed

unified percept, it is important to study both the limbs separately first.
Prevalent theories highlighting the role of central nervous system (CNS) in
accounting for internal body dynamics seem to suggest that both upper limbs
should be equally sensitive to external stimuli. However, there is empirical
proof demonstrating a perceptual difference in our upper limbs for tasks like
shape discrimination, prompting the need to study effects of limb choice on
kinesthetic perception. In this manuscript, we start evaluating Just Noticeable
Difference (JND) for stiffness for both forearms separately. Early results
validate the need for a more thorough investigation of limb choice on
kinesthetic perception.

frontline personnel understand the customer, the better the service they can
provide. As human emotions generate certain (unintentional) bodily reactions,
such as increase in heart rate, sweating, dilation, blushing and paling, which
are measurable, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies can interpret these
signals. Great progress has been made in recent years to automatically detect
basic emotions like joy, anger etc. Complex emotions, consisting of multiple
interdependent basic emotions, are more difficult to identify. One complex
emotion which is of great interest to the service industry is difficult to
detect: whether a customer is telling the truth or just a story. This research
presents an AI-method for capturing and sensing emotional data. With an
accuracy of around 98 %, the best trained model was able to detect whether a
participant of a debating challenge was arguing for or against her/his
conviction, using speech analysis. The data set was collected in an
experimental setting with 40 participants. The findings are applicable to a
wide range of service processes and specifically useful for all customer
interactions that take place via telephone. The algorithm presented can be
applied in any situation where it is helpful for the agent to know whether a
customer is speaking to her/his conviction. This could, for example, lead to a
reduction in doubtful insurance claims, or untruthful statements in job
interviews. This would not only reduce operational losses for service
companies, but also encourage customers to be more truthful.

are incredibly successful at encoding semantic information within their latent
space, even in a completely unsupervised setting. For modern generative
frameworks, this semantic encoding manifests as smooth, linear directions which
affect image attributes in a disentangled manner. These directions have been
widely used in GAN-based image editing. We show that such directions are not
only linear, but that the magnitude of change induced on the respective
attribute is approximately linear with respect to the distance traveled along
them. By leveraging this observation, our method turns a pre-trained GAN into a
regression model, using as few as two labeled samples. This enables solving
regression tasks on datasets and attributes which are difficult to produce
quality supervision for. Additionally, we show that the same latent-distances
can be used to sort collections of images by the strength of given attributes,
even in the absence of explicit supervision. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our method can be applied across a wide range of domains,

analyses. For example, in rare diseases, it can be difficult to establish
treatment efficacy based solely on data from a prospective study due to low
sample sizes. To overcome this issue, an informative prior for the treatment
effect may be elicited. We develop a novel extension of the conjugate prior of
Chen and Ibrahim (2003) that enables practitioners to elicit a prior prediction
for the mean response for generalized linear models, treating the prediction as
random. We refer to the hierarchical prior as the hierarchical prediction
prior. For i.i.d. settings and the normal linear model, we derive cases for
which the hyperprior is a conjugate prior. We also develop an extension of the
HPP in situations where summary statistics from a previous study are available,
drawing comparisons with the power prior. The HPP allows for discounting based
on the quality of individual level predictions, having the potential to provide
efficiency gains (e.g., lower MSE) where predictions are incompatible with the
data. An efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is developed.
Applications illustrate that inferences under the HPP are more robust to
prior-data conflict compared to selected non-hierarchical priors.

is no or only a weak misalignment between the two modalities. In general,
however, this assumption often breaks in actual situations. Due to this
assumption's breakdown, the position of the bounding boxes does not match
between the two modalities, resulting in a significant decrease in detection
accuracy, especially in regions where the amount of misalignment is large. In
this paper, we propose a multi-modal Faster-RCNN that is robust against large
misalignment. The keys are 1) modal-wise regression and 2) multi-modal IoU for
mini-batch sampling. To deal with large misalignment, we perform bounding box
regression for both the RPN and detection-head with both modalities. We also
propose a new sampling strategy called ""multi-modal mini-batch sampling"" that

appear at the second order to the applied electric field. We show that this

band geometric property -- the dipole moment of Berry-connection polarizability
(BCP) in momentum space. The effect has scaling relation and symmetry
constraints that are distinct from the previously studied extrinsic
contributions. Particularly, in antiferromagnets with $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry,
the intrinsic effect dominates. Combined with first-principles calculations, we
demonstrate the first quantitative evaluation of the effect in the
antiferromagnet Mn$_{2}$Au. We show that the BCP dipole and the resulting
intrinsic second-order conductivity are pronounced around band near
degeneracies. Importantly, the intrinsic response exhibits sensitive dependence
on the N\'{e}el vector orientation with a $2\pi$ periodicity, which offers a
new route for electric detection of the magnetic order in
$\mathcal{PT}$-invariant antiferromagnets.

its H$\alpha$ emission properties can only be reproduced if its mass is around

exploits a recently discovered connection between the symmetric group and

is a permutation of birth order. The first important outcome of our study is a
clear combinatorial distinction between the space of phylogenetic trees (as
defined by Billera, Holmes and Vogtmann) and the space of merge trees. Generic
BHV trees on $n+1$ leaf nodes fall into $(2n-1)!!$ distinct strata, but the
analogous number for merge trees is equal to the number of maximal chains in
the lattice of partitions, i.e., $(n+1)!n!2^{-n}$. The second aspect of our
study is the derivation of precise formulas for the distribution of tree

opens the door to doing more precise science.

combined, the averaged spectrum will generally appear etalon-free. This can
mask substantial etaloning at the row level, even if the BI-CCD has been
treated to suppress the effect. This Note compares two methods of etalon
correction, one with simple averaging and one with row-by-row calibration using
a fluorescence standard. Two BI-CCD arrays, both roughened by the supplier to
reduce etaloning, were used to acquire Raman spectra of murine bone specimens.
For one array, etaloning was the dominant source of noise under the exposure
conditions chosen, even for the averaged spectrum across all rows;
near-infrared-excited Raman peaks were noticeably affected. In this case,
row-by-row calibration improved the spectral quality of the average spectrum.
The other CCD's performance was shot-noise limited and therefore received no

importance of checking for and correcting row-level fixed pattern when

recurrent graph learning on arbitrarily long sequences is made possible by
equipping graph convolutions with adjacency adaptivity, which eliminates the
problem of information loss in deep or recurrent graph networks, while it also
allows for learning unknown dependencies between the human body joints. To
further boost accuracy, a spatial attention formalism is incorporated into the

numerically exact method relying on a Matrix Product State representation of

processing applications. Wavelet design has been an active field of research
for over two decades, with the problem often being approached from an
analytical perspective. In this paper, we introduce a learning based approach
to wavelet design. We draw a parallel between convolutional autoencoders and
wavelet multiresolution approximation, and show how the learning angle provides
a coherent computational framework for addressing the design problem. We aim at
designing data-independent wavelets by training filterbank autoencoders, which
precludes the need for customized datasets. In fact, we use high-dimensional
Gaussian vectors for training filterbank autoencoders, and show that a
near-zero training loss implies that the learnt filters satisfy the perfect
reconstruction property with very high probability. Properties of a wavelet
such as orthogonality, compact support, smoothness, symmetry, and vanishing
moments can be incorporated by designing the autoencoder architecture
appropriately and with a suitable regularization term added to the mean-squared
error cost used in the learning process. Our approach not only recovers the

been reported for heterostructures of proximitized topological insulators,
iron-based superconductors or certain transition metal dichalcogenides. Despite
these efforts, the Majorana nature of the observed excitation is still under
debate. We propose to identify the presence of Majorana vortex modes using a
nonlocal transport measurement protocol originally employed for one-dimensional
settings. In the case of an isolated subgap state, the protocol provides a
spatial map of the ratio of local charge- and probability-density which offers
a clear distinction between Majorana and ordinary fermionic modes. We show that
these distinctive features survive in the experimentally relevant case of
hybridizing vortex core modes.

host galaxy's star formation rate by removing gas from the inner region of the

feature in local galaxies, yet, little is known about the frequency of
molecular outflows in main sequence galaxies in the nearby universe. We develop
a rigorous set of selection criteria, which allow the reliable identification
of outflows in large samples of galaxies. Our criteria make use of central
spectra, position-velocity diagrams and velocity-integrated intensity maps
(line-wing maps). We use this method on high-angular resolution CO(2-1)
observations from the PHANGS-ALMA survey, which provides observations of the
molecular gas for a homogeneous sample of 90 nearby main sequence galaxies at a
resolution of ${\sim}100\,$pc. We find correlations between the assigned
outflow confidence and stellar mass or global star formation rate (SFR). We
determine the frequency of central molecular outflows to be $25\pm2$%
considering all outflow candidates, or $20\pm2$% for secure outflows only. Our
resulting outflow candidate sample of $16{-}20$ galaxies shows an overall
enhanced fraction of active galactic nuclei (AGN) (50%) and bars (89%) compared
to the full sample (galaxies with AGN: 24%, with bar: 61%). We extend the trend
between mass outflow rates and SFR known for high outflow rates down to lower
values ($\log_{10}{\dot{\rm M}_{\rm

order unity, indicating that these outflows are not efficient in quenching the

history in the statistical mechanics approach to learning, and in recent years
it has received attention within machine learning proper. Among other things,
local metrics (such as the smoothness of the loss landscape) have been shown to
correlate with global properties of the model (such as good generalization
performance). Here, we perform a detailed empirical analysis of the loss
landscape structure of thousands of neural network models, systematically
varying learning tasks, model architectures, and/or quantity/quality of data.
By considering a range of metrics that attempt to capture different aspects of
the loss landscape, we demonstrate that the best test accuracy is obtained
when: the loss landscape is globally well-connected; ensembles of trained
models are more similar to each other; and models converge to locally smooth
regions. We also show that globally poorly-connected landscapes can arise when
models are small or when they are trained to lower quality data; and that, if
the loss landscape is globally poorly-connected, then training to zero loss can
actually lead to worse test accuracy. Our detailed empirical results shed light
on phases of learning (and consequent double descent behavior), fundamental
versus incidental determinants of good generalization, the role of load-like
and temperature-like parameters in the learning process, different influences
on the loss landscape from model and data, and the relationships between local
and global metrics, all topics of recent interest.

numerical analysis of differential equations to understand and construct new

applies ideas from mechanics and geometric integration to obtain accelerated
optimization methods on Euclidean spaces. This has important consequences given
that accelerated methods are the workhorses behind many machine learning
applications. In this paper we build upon these advances and propose a
framework for dissipative and constrained Hamiltonian systems that is suitable
for solving optimization problems on arbitrary smooth manifolds. Importantly,
this allows us to leverage the well-established theory of symplectic
integration to derive ""rate-matching"" dissipative integrators. This brings a
new perspective to optimization on manifolds whereby convergence guarantees
follow by construction from classical arguments in symplectic geometry and
backward error analysis. Moreover, we construct two dissipative generalizations
of leapfrog that are straightforward to implement: one for Lie groups and
homogeneous spaces, that relies on the tractable geodesic flow or a retraction
thereof, and the other for constrained submanifolds that is based on a
dissipative generalization of the famous RATTLE integrator.

Remarkably, those MGLMMs can be used to represent patterns of association

Gamma distribution based models), positive responses possibly containing
observations with zero values (lesion area, Compound Poisson distribution based

observe the transition from a nucleation and growth regime at high $Pe$ to
""spinodal nucleation"" at low $Pe$. Unlike the case of passive hard spheres,
where preference for FCC over HCP polymorphs is weak, activity causes the
annealing of HCP stacking faults, thus strongly favouring the FCC symmetry at
high $Pe$. When freezing occurs more slowly, in the nucleation and growth

driven slider on top of granular matter, for example. Yet, these set-ups are
often physically limited and might not allow one to determine the underlying
nature of specific features and, hence, the universality and generality of the
experimental observations. Here, we address this challenge by a numerical study
of a spring-slider experiment based on two dimensional discrete element method
simulations, which allows us to control the properties of the granular matter
and of the surface of the slider, for example. Upon quasi-static loading,
stick-slip-type behavior emerges which is contrasted by a stable sliding regime
at finite driving rates, in agreement with experimental observations. Across
large parameter ranges for damping, inter-particle friction, particle
polydispersity etc. the earthquake-like dynamics associated with the former
regime results in several robust scale-free statistical features also observed

origin of the Omori-Utsu relation, the aftershock productivity relation, and
B{\aa}th's relation in the simulations is fundamentally different from the case

there is a direct connection between the fluctuations allowed by an environment

$QCs$ are suppressed, resulting in the separability of the two-qubit entangled

smaller in the common configuration model than that of the opponent.
Furthermore, this protection of the $QCs$ under static noise for large

describe a related, CRISPR-Cas induced, dormancy defense of bacterial hosts to
curb phage epidemics. We first analyse the effect of the dormancy-related model
parameters on the probability and time of invasion of a newly arriving virus
into a resident host population. Given successful invasion in the stochastic
system, we then show that the emergence (with high probability) of a persistent
virus infection ('epidemic') in a large host population can be determined by
the existence of a coexistence equilibrium for the dynamical system arising as
the deterministic many-particle limit of our model. This is an extension of a
dynamical system considered by Beretta and Kuang (1998) that is known to
exhibit a Hopf bifurcation, giving rise to a 'paradox of enrichment'. In our
system, we verify that the additional dormancy component can, at least for
certain parameter ranges, prevent the associated loss of stability. Finally, we
show that the presence of contact-mediated dormancy enables the host population
to attain higher equilibrium sizes - while still being able to avoid a
persistent epidemic - than host populations without this trait.

questions of fundamental physics. Many models, including Weakly Interacting
Massive Particles (WIMPs), assume DM to be a particle and predict a weak
coupling with Standard Model matter. If DM particles can scatter off nuclei in
the vicinity of a massive object such as a star or a planet, they may lose
kinetic energy and become gravitationally trapped in the center of such
objects, including Earth. As DM accumulates in the center of the Earth,
self-annihilation of WIMPs into Standard Model particles can result in an
excess of neutrinos which are detectable at the IceCube Neutrino Observatory,
situated at the geographic South Pole. A search for excess neutrinos from these
annihilations has been performed using 8 years of IceCube data, and results
have been interpreted in the context of a number of WIMP annihilation channels
($\chi\chi\rightarrow\tau^+\tau^-$/$W^+W^-$/$b\bar{b}$) and masses ranging from
10 GeV to 10 TeV. We present the latest results from this analysis and compare
the outcome with previous analyses by IceCube and other experiments, showing
competitive results, which are even world-leading in some parts of the

economic dispatch (CCED). In the proposed model, both power generations and
line susceptances become variables to minimize the expected generation cost and
guarantee a low probability of constraint violation in terms of generations and
line flows under renewable uncertainties. We figure out the mechanism of
network flexibility against uncertainties from the analytical form of CCED. On
one hand, renewable uncertainties shrink the usable line capacities in the line
flow constraints and aggravate transmission congestion. On the other hand,
network flexibility significantly mitigates congestion by regulating the
base-case line flows and reducing the line capacity shrinkage caused by
uncertainties. Further, we propose an alternate iteration solver for this
problem, which is efficient. With duality theory, we propose two convex
subproblems with respect to generation-related variables and network-related
variables, respectively. A satisfactory solution can be obtained by alternately
solving these two subproblems. The case studies on the IEEE 14-bus system and
IEEE 118-bus system suggest that network flexibility contributes much to
operational economy under renewable uncertainties.

suppression of the fluctuating character of the environments are observed to be
entirely attributable to the Gaussian nature of the noise. Furthermore, the
increasing number of environments are witnessed to accelerate the amount of

Then, the perturbed instructions, which serve as hard samples, are used for
improving the robustness of the navigator with an effective adversarial

localisation or local domains, in order to retrieve the state and a mix of key

surrogate dynamical core, for instance through a neural network, which is
reminiscent of data-driven machine learning of dynamics, while the local

update global parameters using a local domain ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF)

using several of the local EnKF flavors. A two-dimensional illustration based

entangled GHZ-like state coupled with independent classical environments. Two
different Gaussian noises in pure and mixed noisy situations, namely, pure
power-law noise, pure fractional Gaussian noise, power-law noise maximized and
fractional Gaussian noise maximized cases are assumed to characterize the
environments. With the help of time-dependent entanglement witnesses, purity,
and decoherence measures, within the full range of parameters, we show that the
current mixed noise cases are more detrimental than pure ones where
entanglement and coherence are found short-lived. The power-law noise phase, in
particular, appears to be more flexible and exploitable for long-term
preservation effects. In contrast, we find that in both pure and mixed noise
cases, where entanglement and coherence degrade at a relatively high rate,
there is no ultimate solution for avoiding the detrimental dephasing effects of
fractional Gaussian noise. The three-qubit state becomes disentangled and
decoherent within independent classical environments driven by both pure and
mixed Gaussian noises, either in long or short interaction time. In addition,
due to the lack of the entanglement revival phenomenon, there is no information
exchange between the system and the environment. The three-qubit GHZ-like
states have thus been realized to be an excellent resource for long enough
quantum correlations, coherence, and quantum information preservation in
classical independent channels driven by pure power-law noise with extremely
low parameter values.

where the target image has a very low resolution. More specifically, our
approach aims at transferring fine details from a high resolution (HR) source
image to fit a coarse, low resolution (LR) image representation of the target.
We therefore generate HR images that share features from both HR and LR inputs.
This differs from previous methods that focus on translating a given image
style into a target content, our translation approach being able to
simultaneously imitate the style and merge the structural information of the LR
target. Our approach relies on training the generative model to produce HR
target images that both 1) share distinctive information of the associated
source image; 2) correctly match the LR target image when downscaled. We
validate our method on the CelebA-HQ and AFHQ datasets by demonstrating
improvements in terms of visual quality, diversity and coverage. Qualitative
and quantitative results show that when dealing with intra-domain image
translation, our method generates more realistic samples compared to
state-of-the-art methods such as Stargan-v2

driven by new imaging and processing techniques. From 3D images to
sophisticated software, hardware and portability improvements, it is clear that
the status of US as one of the leading medical imaging technologies is ensured
for many years ahead. However, as imaging systems evolve, new engineering
challenges emerge. Acquisition, transmission and processing of huge amounts of
data are common for all ultrasound-based imaging modalities. Moreover,
achieving higher resolution is constantly on demand, as improved diagnosis
could be achieved by better visualization of organs and blood vessels deep
within tissues. In this article, our goal is to motivate further interest and

  Unexpected Road Obstacles in Urban-Scene Segmentation","Accepted to ICCV 2021 (Oral Presentation)",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Identifying unexpected objects on roads in semantic segmentation (e.g.,
identifying dogs on roads) is crucial in safety-critical applications. Existing
approaches use images of unexpected objects from external datasets or require
additional training (e.g., retraining segmentation networks or training an
extra network), which necessitate a non-trivial amount of labor intensity or
lengthy inference time. One possible alternative is to use prediction scores of
a pre-trained network such as the max logits (i.e., maximum values among
classes before the final softmax layer) for detecting such objects. However,
the distribution of max logits of each predicted class is significantly
different from each other, which degrades the performance of identifying
unexpected objects in urban-scene segmentation. To address this issue, we
propose a simple yet effective approach that standardizes the max logits in
order to align the different distributions and reflect the relative meanings of
max logits within each predicted class. Moreover, we consider the local regions
from two different perspectives based on the intuition that neighboring pixels
share similar semantic information. In contrast to previous approaches, our
method does not utilize any external datasets or require additional training,
which makes our method widely applicable to existing pre-trained segmentation
models. Such a straightforward approach achieves a new state-of-the-art
performance on the publicly available Fishyscapes Lost & Found leaderboard with
a large margin. Our code is publicly available at this

is an attractive approach of parameter estimation in time series analysis.
Whittle estimators are a prominent example in this context. Under weak

spectral densities fitted, the distribution of Whittle estimators typically
depends on difficult to estimate characteristics of the underlying process.
This makes the implementation of asymptotic results for the construction of
confidence intervals or for assessing the variability of estimators, difficult
in practice. This paper proposes a frequency domain bootstrap method to
estimate the distribution of Whittle estimators which is asymptotically valid
under assumptions that not only allow for (possible) model misspecification but
also for weak dependence conditions which are satisfied by a wide range of
stationary stochastic processes. Adaptions of the bootstrap procedure developed
to incorporate different modifications of Whittle estimators proposed in the

This study aims to (1) investigate the possibility of using a human values

identify possible benefits of using a human values dashboard, and (3) elicit
practitioners' needs from a human values dashboard. Method: We conducted an

artefacts, especially requirements documents and issue discussions, are the
most suitable source for identifying values for the dashboard. Our study also
yields a set of high-level user requirements for a human values dashboard

Our study suggests that a values dashboard is potentially used to raise

  Due to the discrete nature of textual data, gradient-based adversarial

  We show that the proposed attack outperforms competitors on a diverse set of
NLP problems for both computed metrics and human evaluation. Moreover, due to
the usage of the fine-tuned language model, the generated adversarial examples
are hard to detect, thus current models are not robust. Hence, it is difficult

a standard continuous finite element discretization of a nonlinear hyperbolic
problem to satisfy relevant maximum principles and entropy stability
conditions. The desired properties are enforced by applying a limiter to
antidiffusive fluxes that represent the difference between the high-order
baseline scheme and a property-preserving approximation of Lax--Friedrichs
type. In the first step of the limiting procedure, the given target fluxes are
adjusted in a way that guarantees preservation of local and/or global bounds.
In the second step, additional limiting is performed, if necessary,to ensure
the validity of fully discrete and/or semi-discrete entropy inequalities. The
limiter-based entropy fixes considered in this work are applicable to finite
element discretizations of scalar hyperbolic equations and systems alike. The
underlying inequality constraints are formulated using Tadmor's entropy
stability theory.
  The proposed limiters impose entropy-conservative or entropy-dissipative
bounds on the rate of entropy production by antidiffusive fluxes and
Runge--Kutta (RK) time discretizations. Two versions of the fully discrete
entropy fix are developed for this purpose. To motivate the use of
limiter-based entropy fixes, we prove a finite element version of the
Lax--Wendroff theorem and perform numerical studies for standard test problems.
In our numerical experiments, entropy-dissipative schemes converge to correct

monitoring (NILM) and it can provide useful transient information to identify
appliances. However, existing event detection methods with fixed parameters may
fail in case of unpredictable and complicated residential load changes such as
high fluctuation, long transition, and near simultaneity. This paper proposes a
dynamic time-window approach to deal with these highly complex load variations.
Specifically, a window with adaptive margins, multi-timescale window screening,
and adaptive threshold (WAMMA) method is proposed to detect events in
aggregated home appliance load data with high sampling rate (>1Hz). The
proposed method accurately captures the transient process by adaptively tuning
parameters including window width, margin width, and change threshold.
Furthermore, representative transient and steady-state load signatures are
extracted and, for the first time, quantified from transient and steady periods
segmented by detected events. Case studies on a 20Hz dataset, the 50Hz LIFTED
dataset, and the 60Hz BLUED dataset show that the proposed method can robustly
outperform other state-of-art event detection methods. This paper also shows
that the extracted load signatures can improve NILM accuracy and help develop
other applications such as load reconstruction to generate realistic load data

""archetypal cases"" in ways that makes all the proofs easy to lift to the

a variant of the ""toposes with canonical subobjects"" from [Lambek/Scott 1986];
all toposes of the form $\mathbf{Set}^\mathbf{C}$, where $\mathbf{C}$ is a
small category, are toposes with inclusions, and when we work with toposes with
inclusions concepts like subsets and intersections are very easy to formalize.
We do all our proofs on the correspondence between closure operators and

proofs to proofs that work on any topos. Our second archetypal case is toposes
of the form $\mathbf{Set}^\mathbf{D}$, where $\mathbf{D}$ is a finite

However, current algorithms mainly share one limitation: They rely on directly
visible objects. This is a significant drawback compared to human behavior,
where visual cues caused by objects (e.g., shadows) are already used
intuitively to retrieve information or anticipate occurring objects. While
driving at night, this performance deficit becomes even more obvious: Humans
already process the light artifacts caused by the headlamps of oncoming
vehicles to estimate where they appear, whereas current object detection
systems require that the oncoming vehicle is directly visible before it can be
detected. Based on previous work on this subject, in this paper, we present a
complete system that can detect light artifacts caused by the headlights of
oncoming vehicles so that it detects that a vehicle is approaching providently.
For that, an entire algorithm architecture is investigated, including the
detection in the image space, the three-dimensional localization, and the
tracking of light artifacts. To demonstrate the usefulness of such an
algorithm, the proposed algorithm is deployed in a test vehicle to use the
detected light artifacts to control the glare-free high beam system
proactively. Using this experimental setting, the provident vehicle detection
system's time benefit compared to an in-production computer vision system is
quantified. Additionally, the glare-free high beam use case provides a

considering the adaptive headlamps as projectors. With this investigation of

$\lambda_{\alpha}$, and groomed jet angularities, $\lambda_{\alpha\text{,g}}$,
to investigate the interplay between perturbative and nonperturbative effects
at low jet momenta. Various angular exponent parameters $\alpha = 1$, 1.5, 2,

collinear and soft radiation. Results are compared to analytical predictions at
next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy, which provide a generally good
description of the data in the perturbative regime but exhibit discrepancies in
the nonperturbative regime. Moreover, these measurements serve as a baseline
for future ones in heavy-ion collisions by providing new insight into the
interplay between perturbative and nonperturbative effects in the angular and
momentum substructure of jets. They supply crucial guidance on the selection of
jet resolution parameter, jet transverse momentum, and angular scaling variable

optimization problems over mesh networks, subject to quantized communications.
Instead of focusing on a specific algorithmic design, a black-box model is
proposed, casting linearly convergent distributed algorithms in the form of
fixed-point iterates. The algorithmic model is equipped with a novel random or
deterministic Biased Compression (BC) rule on the quantizer design, and a new
Adaptive encoding Nonuniform Quantizer (ANQ) coupled with a
communication-efficient encoding scheme, which implements the BC-rule using a
finite number of bits (below machine precision). This fills a gap existing in
most state-of-the-art quantization schemes, such as those based on the popular
compression rule, which rely on communication of some scalar signals with
negligible quantization error (in practice quantized at the machine precision).
A unified communication complexity analysis is developed for the black-box
model, determining the average number of bits required to reach a solution of
the optimization problem within a target accuracy. It is shown that the
proposed BC-rule preserves linear convergence of the unquantized algorithms,
and a trade-off between convergence rate and communication cost under ANQ-based
quantization is characterized. Numerical results validate our theoretical
findings and show that distributed algorithms equipped with the proposed ANQ
have more favorable communication cost than algorithms using state-of-the-art
quantization rules.

  A non-invasive methodology, based on in vivo optical measurements is proposed
to determine strains of abdominal wall corresponding to a known intraabdominal

peritoneal dialysis. A dedicated experimental stand is designed for the

  The study provides information on strain fields of living human abdominal

at the level from -10% to 17%. The intraabdominal pressure related to the
amount of introduced dialysis fluid measured within the medical procedure
covers the range 11-18.5 cmH$_2$O.

multivariate Gaussian data that relies on decomposing them into a low-rank and
a diagonal component. Such decompositions are very popular for modeling large
covariance matrices as they admit a latent factor based representation that
allows easy inference. The same is however not true for precision matrices due
to the lack of computationally convenient representations which restricts
inference to low-to-moderate dimensional problems. We address this remarkable
gap in the literature by building on a latent variable representation for such
decomposition for precision matrices. The construction leads to an efficient
Gibbs sampler that scales very well to high-dimensional problems far beyond the
limits of the current state-of-the-art. The ability to efficiently explore the
full posterior space also allows the model uncertainty to be easily assessed.
The decomposition crucially additionally allows us to adapt sparsity inducing
priors to shrink the insignificant entries of the precision matrix toward zero,
making the approach adaptable to high-dimensional small-sample-size sparse
settings. Exact zeros in the matrix encoding the underlying conditional
independence graph are then determined via a novel posterior false discovery
rate control procedure. A near minimax optimal posterior concentration rate for
estimating precision matrices is attained by our method under mild regularity
assumptions. We evaluate the method's empirical performance through synthetic
experiments and illustrate its practical utility in data sets from two
different application domains.

However, for sign languages, this implies breaking motion into its constituent

traditionally done just this, building up animation from sequences of hand

based solutions to SLP have tackled the problem using a single network that
estimates the full skeletal structure.
  We propose splitting the SLP task into two distinct jointly-trained
sub-tasks. The first translation sub-task translates from spoken language to a
latent sign language representation, with gloss supervision. Subsequently, the
animation sub-task aims to produce expressive sign language sequences that
closely resemble the learnt spatio-temporal representation. Using a progressive
transformer for the translation sub-task, we propose a novel Mixture of Motion

at inference to animate continuous sign language sequences.

outperforms baselines in user evaluations. We achieve state-of-the-art back

literature has focused on computationally intensive optimization-based methods
that maximize system throughput or minimize vehicle miles. However, individual
customers may experience substantial service quality degradation due to the
consequent waiting and detour time. In contrast, this paper examines heuristic
methods for real-time ride-pooling assignments that are highly scalable and
easily computable. We propose a restricted subgraph method and compare it with
other existing heuristic and optimization-based matching algorithms using a

improves the satellite imagery-based forest type classification. However,
aerial imagery is significantly more expensive to collect and it is unclear by

private information from a wireless signal classifier. Machine learning (ML)
provides powerful means to classify wireless signals, e.g., for PHY-layer
authentication. As an adversarial machine learning attack, the MIA infers
whether a signal of interest has been used in the training data of a target
classifier. This private information incorporates waveform, channel, and device
characteristics, and if leaked, can be exploited by an adversary to identify
vulnerabilities of the underlying ML model (e.g., to infiltrate the PHY-layer
authentication). One challenge for the over-the-air MIA is that the received
signals and consequently the RF fingerprints at the adversary and the intended
receiver differ due to the discrepancy in channel conditions. Therefore, the
adversary first builds a surrogate classifier by observing the spectrum and
then launches the black-box MIA on this classifier. The MIA results show that
the adversary can reliably infer signals (and potentially the radio and channel
information) used to build the target classifier. Therefore, a proactive
defense is developed against the MIA by building a shadow MIA model and fooling
the adversary. This defense can successfully reduce the MIA accuracy and
prevent information leakage from the wireless signal classifier.

was validated against a series of commissioning measurements using pinpoint
chambers and 2D array ionization chambers in terms of lateral profiles and
depth dose distributions. Furthermore, beam delivery module and treatment
planning has been validated against the literature deploying various clinical
test cases of AAPM TG-119 and a prostate patient. Result: MC simulation showed
an excellent agreement with measurements in the lateral depth-dose parameters

measurement in terms of absorbed dose in SOBP region was $0.93\% \pm 0.88\%$.

respect to the experimental measurements. A water phantom was used to simulate
system energy parameters using a set of depth-dose data in the energy range of
120-235 MeV. To compare the performance of PSPT against PBS, multiple
dosimetric parameters including FWHM, peak position, range, peak-to-entrance
dose ratio, and dose volume histogram have been analyzed under the same
conditions. Furthermore, the clinical test cases introduced by AAPM TG-119 were
simulated in both beam delivery modes to compare the relevant clinical values
obtained from DVH analysis. The parametric comparison in the water phantom
between the two techniques revealed that the value of peak-to-entrance dose
ratio in PSPT is considerably higher than that from PBS by a factor of 8%. In
addition, the FWHM of the lateral beam profile in PSPT was increased by a
factor of 7% compared to the corresponding value obtained from PBS model.
TG-119 phantom simulations showed that the difference of PTV mean dose between
PBS and PSPT techniques are up to 2.9% while the difference of max dose to

explores to diagnose GAN intra-mode collapse and calibrate that, in a novel

  Validation","Accepted by the 2021 Machine Learning for Healthcare Conference",,,,"cs.CY cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Once integrated into clinical care, patient risk stratification models may
perform worse compared to their retrospective performance. To date, it is
widely accepted that performance will degrade over time due to changes in care
processes and patient populations. However, the extent to which this occurs is
poorly understood, in part because few researchers report prospective
validation performance. In this study, we compare the 2020-2021 ('20-'21)
prospective performance of a patient risk stratification model for predicting
healthcare-associated infections to a 2019-2020 ('19-'20) retrospective
validation of the same model. We define the difference in retrospective and
prospective performance as the performance gap. We estimate how i) ""temporal
shift"", i.e., changes in clinical workflows and patient populations, and ii)
""infrastructure shift"", i.e., changes in access, extraction and transformation
of data, both contribute to the performance gap. Applied prospectively to
26,864 hospital encounters during a twelve-month period from July 2020 to June
2021, the model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) of 0.767 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.737, 0.801) and a Brier
score of 0.189 (95% CI: 0.186, 0.191). Prospective performance decreased
slightly compared to '19-'20 retrospective performance, in which the model
achieved an AUROC of 0.778 (95% CI: 0.744, 0.815) and a Brier score of 0.163
(95% CI: 0.161, 0.165). The resulting performance gap was primarily due to
infrastructure shift and not temporal shift. So long as we continue to develop
and validate models using data stored in large research data warehouses, we
must consider differences in how and when data are accessed, measure how these
differences may affect prospective performance, and work to mitigate those
differences.

patient's symptom profiles, which complicates the development of general
treatments. In the UNITI project, researchers from different European countries
try to unify existing treatments and interventions to cope with this
heterogeneity. One study arm (UNITI Mobile) exploits mobile technology to
investigate newly implemented interventions types, especially within the
pan-European setting. The goals are to learn more about the validity and
usefulness of mobile technology in this context. Furthermore, differences among
the countries shall be investigated. Practically, two native intervention apps
have been developed for UNITI and the mobile study arm, which pose features not
presented so far in other apps of the authors. Along the implementation
procedure, it is discussed whether these features might leverage similar types
of studies in future. Since instruments like the mHealth evidence reporting and

climate statistics, such as the global top-of-atmosphere energy balance, to
observations. The manual tuning only targets a limited subset of observational
data and parameters. Bayesian calibration can estimate climate model parameters
and their uncertainty using a larger fraction of the available data and
automatically exploring the parameter space more broadly. In Bayesian learning,
it is natural to exploit the seasonal cycle, which has large amplitude,
compared with anthropogenic climate change, in many climate statistics. In this
study, we develop methods for the calibration and uncertainty quantification
(UQ) of model parameters exploiting the seasonal cycle, and we demonstrate a
proof-of-concept with an idealized general circulation model (GCM). Uncertainty
quantification is performed using the calibrate-emulate-sample approach, which
combines stochastic optimization and machine learning emulation to speed up
Bayesian learning. The methods are demonstrated in a perfect-model setting
through the calibration and UQ of a convective parameterization in an idealized
GCM with a seasonal cycle. Calibration and UQ based on seasonally averaged
climate statistics, compared to annually averaged, reduces the calibration
error by up to an order of magnitude and narrows the spread of posterior
distributions by factors between two and five, depending on the variables used
for UQ. The reduction in the size of the parameter posterior distributions
leads to a reduction in the uncertainty of climate model predictions.

high-performance electrodes with state-of-the-art solid electrolytes. For
example, lithium (Li) metal, the most energy-dense anode candidate, suffers
from severe interfacial chemomechanical issues that lead to cell failure. Li
alloys of In/Sn are attractive alternatives, but their exploration has mostly
been limited to the low capacity(low Li content)and In rich Li$_x$In
(x$\leq$0.5). Here, the fundamental electro-chemo-mechanical behavior of Li-In
and Li-Sn alloys of varied Li stoichiometries is unravelled in sulfide
electrolyte based SSBs. The intermetallic electrodes developed through a
controlled synthesis and fabrication technique display impressive
(electro)chemical stability with Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl as the solid electrolyte and
maintain nearly perfect interfacial contact during the electrochemical Li
insertion/deinsertion under an optimal stack pressure. Their intriguing
variation in the Li migration barrier with composition and its influence on the
observed Li cycling overpotential is revealed through combined computational
and electrochemical studies. Stable interfacial chemomechanics of the alloys
allow long-term dendrite free Li cycling (>1000 h) at relatively high current
densities (1 mA cm$^{-2}$) and capacities (1 mAh cm$^{-2}$), as demonstrated
for Li$_{13}$In$_3$ and Li$_{17}$Sn$_4$, which are more desirable from a
capacity and cost consideration compared to the low Li content analogues. The
presented understanding can guide the development of high-capacity Li-In/Sn
