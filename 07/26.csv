In
cases like Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Asthma, acute and chronic
Bronchitis and the recent pandemic Covid-19, the early identification of cough
is important to provide healthcare professionals with useful clinical
information such as frequency, severity, and nature of cough to enable better
diagnosis. This paper presents and demonstrates best feature selection using
MFCC which can help to determine cough events, eventually helping a neural
network to learn and improve accuracy of cough detection. The paper proposes to
achieve performance of 97.77% Sensitivity (SE), 98.75% Specificity (SP) and
98.17% F1-score with a very light binary classification network of size close
to 16K parameters, enabling fitment into smart IoT devices.

obtained from CAD and actuator models. The more accurate the model the better
the control performance. However, in bipedal robots that demonstrate high
agility actions, such as running and hopping, the robot hardware will suffer
from impacts with the environment and deform in vulnerable parts, which
invalidates the predefined model. Thus, it is desired to have an adaptable
kinematic structure that takes deformation into consideration. To account for
this we propose an approach that models all of the robotic joints as 6-DOF
joints and develop an algorithm that can identify the kinematic structure from
motion capture data. We evaluate the algorithm's performance both in simulation
- a three link pendulum, and on a bipedal robot - ATRIAS. In the simulated case
the algorithm produces a result that has a 3.6% error compared to the ground
truth, and on the real life bipedal robot the algorithm's result confirms our
prior assumption where the joint deforms on out-of-plane degrees of freedom. In
addition our algorithm is able to predict torques and forces using the
reconstructed joint mode.

folding process to provide stability to the protein structure and to prevent
aggregation. Nevertheless, proteins do expose some 'sticky' hydrophobic
residues to the solvent. These residues can play an important functional role,
for example in protein-protein and membrane interactions. Here, we investigate
how hydrophobic protein surfaces are by providing three measures for surface
hydrophobicity: the total hydrophobic surface area, the relative hydrophobic
surface area, and - using our MolPatch method - the largest hydrophobic patch.
Secondly, we analyse how difficult it is to predict these measures from
sequence: by adapting solvent accessibility predictions from NetSurfP2.0, we
obtain well-performing prediction methods for the THSA and RHSA, while
predicting LHP is more difficult. Finally, we analyse implications of exposed
hydrophobic surfaces: we show that hydrophobic proteins typically have low
expression, suggesting cells avoid an overabundance of sticky proteins.

MPL[E], i.e., monadic path logic extended with the equal-level predicate. The

penalty methods for constraint handling of system outputs and inputs allows us
to optimize the control law's parameters directly by backpropagating economic

  Our main result is a low-bandwidth scheme to compute linear functions for

still challenging to obtain second-order convergence even for simple periodic
domains. In this paper we perform a systematic numerical study of convergence
and accuracy of kernel-based approximation, discretization operators, and
weakly-compressible SPH (WCSPH) schemes. We explore the origins of the errors
and issues preventing second-order convergence despite having a periodic
domain. Based on the study, we propose several new variations of the basic
WCSPH scheme that are all second-order accurate. Additionally, we investigate
the linear and angular momentum conservation property of the WCSPH schemes. Our
results show that one may construct accurate WCSPH schemes that demonstrate
second-order convergence through a judicious choice of kernel, smoothing
length, and discretization operators in the discretization of the governing
equations.

many links within the modules and few links between them. One approach to
increase the robustness of these systems is to reinforce a fraction of the
nodes in each module, so that the reinforced nodes provide additional needed
sources for themselves as well as for their nearby neighborhood. Since
reinforcing a node can be an expensive task, the efficiency of the
decentralization process by reinforced nodes is vital. In our study we analyze
a new model which combines both above mentioned features of real complex
systems - modularity and reinforced nodes. Using tools from percolation theory,
we derived an analytical solution for any partition of reinforced nodes;
between nodes which have links that connect them to other modules
(""inter-nodes"") and nodes which have connections only within their modules
(""intra-nodes""). Among our results, we find that near the critical percolation
point ($p\approx p_c$) the robustness is greatly affected by the distribution.
In particular, we find a partition of reinforced nodes which yields an optimal
robustness and we show that the optimal partition remains constant for high
average degrees.

directly voting and transitively delegating their votes to other voters. While
fluid democracy has been viewed as a system that can combine the best aspects
of direct and representative democracy, it can also result in situations where
few voters amass a large amount of influence. To analyze the impact of this
shortcoming, we consider what has been called an epistemic setting, where
voters decide on a binary issue for which there is a ground truth. Previous
work has shown that under certain assumptions on the delegation mechanism, the
concentration of power is so severe that fluid democracy is less likely to
identify the ground truth than direct voting. We examine different, arguably
more realistic, classes of mechanisms, and prove they behave well by ensuring
that (with high probability) there is a limit on concentration of power. Our
proofs demonstrate that delegations can be treated as stochastic processes and
that they can be compared to well-known processes from the literature -- such
as preferential attachment and multi-types branching process -- that are
sufficiently bounded for our purposes. Our results suggest that the concerns
raised about fluid democracy can be overcome, thereby bolstering the case for
this emerging paradigm.

explicit pathways for learning discriminative temporal and spatial features,
with each component further factorized to capture complementary person-specific
appearance and motion information. Specifically, temporal factorization
comprises two branches, one each for static features (e.g., the color of

patterns) that change over time. Further, spatial factorization also comprises
two branches to learn both global (coarse segments) as well as local (finer

cases of occlusion or spatial misalignment. These two factorization operations
taken together result in a modular architecture for our parameter-wise light

combines a Transformer-based bi-encoder with a sparse model of explanatory
power, designed to leverage explicit inference patterns in the explanations.
Our experiments demonstrate that the hybrid framework significantly outperforms
previous sparse models, achieving performance comparable with that of
state-of-the-art cross-encoders while being approx 50 times faster and scalable
to corpora of millions of facts. Further analyses on semantic drift and
multi-hop question answering reveal that the proposed hybridisation boosts the
quality of the most challenging explanations, contributing to improved
performance on downstream inference tasks.

  Imputation Perspective","Early Accepted by MICCAI 2021. Traveling Award",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Data from multi-modality provide complementary information in clinical
prediction, but missing data in clinical cohorts limits the number of subjects
in multi-modal learning context. Multi-modal missing imputation is challenging
with existing methods when 1) the missing data span across heterogeneous
modalities (e.g., image vs. non-image); or 2) one modality is largely missing.
In this paper, we address imputation of missing data by modeling the joint
distribution of multi-modal data. Motivated by partial bidirectional generative
adversarial net (PBiGAN), we propose a new Conditional PBiGAN (C-PBiGAN) method
that imputes one modality combining the conditional knowledge from another
modality. Specifically, C-PBiGAN introduces a conditional latent space in a
missing imputation framework that jointly encodes the available multi-modal
data, along with a class regularization loss on imputed data to recover
discriminative information. To our knowledge, it is the first generative
adversarial model that addresses multi-modal missing imputation by modeling the
joint distribution of image and non-image data. We validate our model with both
the national lung screening trial (NLST) dataset and an external clinical
validation cohort. The proposed C-PBiGAN achieves significant improvements in
lung cancer risk estimation compared with representative imputation methods
(e.g., AUC values increase in both NLST (+2.9\%) and in-house dataset (+4.3\%)
compared with PBiGAN, p$<$0.05).

explaining, and predicting interesting computational phenomena associated with
statistical problems. When equating computational efficiency with the existence
of polynomial time algorithms, the computational hardness of (some variant of)
the planted clique problem can be used to infer the computational hardness of a
host of other statistical problems.
  Is this ability to transfer computational hardness from (some variant of) the
planted clique problem to other statistical problems robust to changing our
notion of computational efficiency to space efficiency?
  We answer this question affirmatively for three different statistical
problems, namely Sparse PCA, submatrix detection, and testing almost k-wise
independence. The key challenge is that space efficient randomized reductions
need to repeatedly access the randomness they use. Known reductions to these
problems are all randomized and need polynomially many random bits to
implement. Since we can not store polynomially many random bits in memory, it
is unclear how to implement these existing reductions space efficiently. There
are two ideas involved in circumventing this issue and implementing known
reductions to these problems space efficiently.
  1. When solving statistical problems, we can use parts of the input itself as
randomness.
  2. Secret leakage variants of the planted clique problem with appropriate
secret leakage can be more useful than the standard planted clique problem when
we want to use parts of the input as randomness.

based on a technique named phase spectrometry (PS) that is mainly suitable for
mm-Wave and Tera-hertz applications as an alternative for DoA estimation using
antenna arrays. PS is a conventional technique in optics to measure phase
difference between two waves at different frequencies of the spectrum. Here we
adapt PS for the same purpose in the radio frequency band. We show that we can
emulate a large array exploiting only two antennas. To this end, we measure
phase difference between the two antennas for different frequencies using PS.
Consequently, we demonstrate that we can radically reduce the complexity of the
receiver required for DoA estimation employing PS. We consider two different
schemes for implementation of PS: via a long wave-guide and frequency
code-book. We show that using a frequency code-book, higher processing gain can
be achieved. Moreover, we introduce three PS architectures: for device to
device DoA estimation, for base-station in uplink scenario and an ultra-fast
DoA estimation technique mainly for radar and aerial and satellite
communications. Simulation and analytical results show that, PS is capable of
detecting and discriminating between multiple incoming signals with different
DoAs. Moreover, our results also show that, the angular resolution of PS
depends on the distance between the two antennas and the band-width of the
frequency code-book. Finally, the performance of PS is compared with a uniform
linear array (ULA) and it is shown that PS can perform the same, with a much
less complex receiver, and without the prerequisite of spatial search for DoA
estimation.

$\star$-entries one needs to add so as to increase the said degree of
resilience to reach a target. Our approach goes by translating these questions
into max-flow problems on appropriately defined bipartite graphs. Based on

$50\%$. Our strategy is based on the RM123 approach in which the lattice
path-integral is expanded in powers of the isospin breaking parameter $\Delta
m= (m_{d}-m_{u})/2$. In order to evaluate the relevant lattice correlators we
make use of the recently proposed rotated twisted-mass (RTM) scheme. Within the
RM123 approach, it is possible to cleanly extract the value of $\ell_{7}$ from
either the pion mass splitting $M_{\pi^{+}}-M_{\pi^{0}}$ induced by strong
isospin breaking at order $\mathcal{O}\left((\Delta m)^{2}\right)$ (mass
method), or from the coupling of the neutral pion $\pi^{0}$ to the isoscalar
operator $\left(\bar{u}\gamma_{5}u + \bar{d}\gamma_{5} d\right)/\sqrt{2}$ at
order $\mathcal{O}(\Delta m)$ (matrix element method). In this pilot study we
limit the analysis to a single ensemble generated by the Extended Twisted Mass
Collaboration (ETMC) with $N_{f}=2+1+1$ dynamical quark flavours, which
corresponds to a lattice spacing $a\simeq 0.095~{\rm fm}$ and to a pion mass
$M_{\pi}\simeq 260~{\rm MeV}$. We find that the matrix element method
outperforms the mass method in terms of resulting statistical accuracy. Our
determination, $\ell_{7} = 2.5(1.4)\times 10^{-3}$, is in agreement and

the minimization of the overall cost of the objects up to the considered time
horizon. Among solutions with minimum cost, a solution that maximizes the value
of the leftovers at the end of the considered horizon is sought. A
forward-looking matheuristic approach that applies to this problem is
introduced in the present work. At each decision instant, the objects and the
cutting pattern that will be used is determined, taking into account the impact
of this decision in future states of the system. More specifically, for each
potentially used object, an attempt is made to estimate the utilization rate of
its leftovers and thereby determine whether the object should be used or not.
The approach's performance is compared to the performance of a myopic
technique. Numerical experiments show the efficacy of the proposed approach.

binaries of precessing black holes are the spin tilt angles, i.e., the angles
at which the black holes' spin axes are inclined with respect to the binary's
orbital angular momentum. The LIGO-Virgo parameter estimation analyses
currently provide spin tilts at a fiducial reference frequency, often the
lowest frequency used in the data analysis. However, the most astrophysically
interesting quantities are the spin tilts when the binary was formed, which can
be significantly different from those at the reference frequency for strongly
precessing binaries. The spin tilts at formally infinite separation are a good
approximation to the tilts at formation in many formation channels and can be
computed efficiently for binary black holes using precession-averaged
evolution. Here, we present a new code for computing the tilts at infinity that
combines the precession-averaged evolution with orbit-averaged evolution at
high frequencies and illustrate its application to GW190521 and other binary
black hole detections from O3a. We have empirically determined the transition
frequency between the orbit-averaged and precession-averaged evolution to
produce tilts at infinity with a given accuracy. We also have regularized the
precession-averaged equations in order to obtain good accuracy for the very
close-to-equal-mass binary parameters encountered in practice. This
additionally allows us to investigate the singular equal-mass limit of the
precession-averaged expressions, where we find an approximate scaling of $1/(1
- q)$ with the mass ratio $q$.

full recount -- at the cost of some controlled probability of error. A recently
developed approach for conducting RLAs, SHANGRLA, provides a flexible framework
that can encompass a wide variety of social choice functions and audit
strategies. Its flexibility comes from reducing sufficient conditions for
outcomes to be correct to canonical `assertions' that have a simple
mathematical form.
  Assertions have been developed for auditing various social choice functions
including plurality, multi-winner plurality, super-majority, Hamiltonian
methods, and instant runoff voting. However, there is no systematic approach to
building assertions. Here, we show that assertions with linear dependence on
transformations of the votes can easily be transformed to canonical form for
SHANGRLA. We illustrate the approach by constructing assertions for party-list
elections such as Hamiltonian free list elections and elections using the
D'Hondt method, expanding the set of social choice functions to which SHANGRLA
applies directly.

markets bears considerable challenges related to disclosing sensitive
information. Despite considerable research focused on different aspects of
privacy-enhancing data markets for the IoT, none of the solutions proposed so
far seems to find a practical adoption. Thus, this study aims to organize the
state-of-the-art solutions, analyze and scope the technologies that have been
suggested in this context, and structure the remaining challenges to determine
areas where future research is required. To accomplish this goal, we conducted
a systematic literature review on privacy enhancement in data markets for the
IoT, covering 50 publications dated up to July 2020, and provided updates with
24 publications dated up to May 2022. Our results indicate that most research
in this area has emerged only recently, and no IoT data market architecture has
established itself as canonical. Existing solutions frequently lack the
required combination of anonymization and secure computation technologies.
Furthermore, there is no consensus on the appropriate use of blockchain
technology for IoT data markets and a low degree of leveraging existing
libraries or reusing generic data market architectures. We also identified
significant challenges remaining, such as the copy problem and the recursive
enforcement problem that-while solutions have been suggested to some extent-are
often not sufficiently addressed in proposed designs. We conclude that
privacy-enhancing technologies need further improvements to positively impact
data markets so that, ultimately, the value of data is preserved through data

with the aim of delivering efficient and robust numerical performance for
functions of all types, from smooth to non-smooth, and under different noise
regimes. To this end, we have developed Full-Low Evaluation methods, organized
around two main types of iterations. The first iteration type is expensive in
function evaluations, but exhibits good performance in the smooth and non-noisy
cases. For the theory, we consider a line search based on an approximate
gradient, backtracking until a sufficient decrease condition is satisfied. In
practice, the gradient was approximated via finite differences, and the
direction was calculated by a quasi-Newton step (BFGS). The second iteration
type is cheap in function evaluations, yet more robust in the presence of noise
or non-smoothness. For the theory, we consider direct search, and in practice
we use probabilistic direct search with one random direction and its negative.
A switch condition from Full-Eval to Low-Eval iterations was developed based on
the values of the line-search and direct-search stepsizes. If enough Full-Eval
steps are taken, we derive a complexity result of gradient-descent type. Under
failure of Full-Eval, the Low-Eval iterations become the drivers of convergence
yielding non-smooth convergence. Full-Low Evaluation methods are shown to be
efficient and robust in practice across problems with different levels of
smoothness and noise.

which play an important role in recommender systems, active learning, revenue

principle, using dynamic programming, the computation required scales
exponentially in the number of arms $N$. Thus, there is substantial value in
understanding the performance of index policies and other policies that can be
computed efficiently for large $N$. We study the growth of the optimality gap,
i.e., the loss in expected performance compared to an optimal policy, for such
policies in a classical asymptotic regime proposed by Whittle in which $N$
grows while holding constant the fraction of arms that can be pulled per
period. Intuition from the Central Limit Theorem and the tightest previous
theoretical bounds suggest that this optimality gap should grow like
$O(\sqrt{N})$. Surprisingly, we show that it is possible to outperform this
bound. We characterize a non-degeneracy condition and a wide class of novel
practically-computable policies, called fluid-priority policies, in which the
optimality gap is $O(1)$. These include most widely-used index policies. When
this non-degeneracy condition does not hold, we show that fluid-priority
policies nevertheless have an optimality gap that is $O(\sqrt{N})$,
significantly generalizing the class of policies for which convergence rates
are known. We demonstrate that fluid-priority policies offer state-of-the-art

Specifically, we first predict the pixel-wise segmentation map of road curbs,
and then conduct a series of post-processing steps to extract the graph
structure of road curbs. To tackle the disconnectivity issue in the
segmentation maps, we propose an innovative connectivity-preserving loss
(CP-loss) to improve the segmentation performance. The experimental results on
a public dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed loss function.

approach in robust machine learning is to exert lower weights on samples which
are likely to be noisy or quite hard. This study reveals another undiscovered
strategy, namely, compensating. Various incarnations of compensating have been
utilized but it has not been explicitly revealed. Learning with compensating is
called compensation learning and a systematic taxonomy is constructed for it in
this study. In our taxonomy, compensation learning is divided on the basis of
the compensation targets, directions, inference manners, and granularity
levels. Many existing learning algorithms including some classical ones can be
viewed or understood at least partially as compensation techniques.
Furthermore, a family of new learning algorithms can be obtained by plugging
the compensation learning into existing learning algorithms. Specifically, two
concrete new learning algorithms are proposed for robust machine learning.
Extensive experiments on image classification and text sentiment analysis
verify the effectiveness of the two new algorithms. Compensation learning can
also be used in other various learning scenarios, such as imbalance learning,
clustering, regression, and so on.

to existing automated Gaussian decomposition algorithms, AMOEBA (Automated
MOlecular Excitation Bayesian line-fitting Algorithm) employs a Bayesian
approach to model selection, fitting all 4 optical depth and 4 emission spectra
simultaneously. AMOEBA assumes that a given spectral feature can be described
by a single centroid velocity and full width at half-maximum, with peak values
in the individual optical depth and emission spectra then described uniquely by
the column density in each of the four levels of the ground-rotational state,
thus naturally including the real physical constraints on these parameters.
Additionally, the Bayesian approach includes informed priors on individual
parameters which the user can modify to suit different data sets. Here we
describe AMOEBA and evaluate its validity and reliability in identifying and

further demonstrate this design principle by stacking antiferromagnetic

The AVH effect can be well controlled by modulating the stacking pattern. In
addition, by reversing the ferroelectric polarization of Sc2CO2 via electric

$q$-exponential family which has applications in non-extensive statistical
physics, information theory and statistics. In previous information-geometric

and Bregman divergence. In this paper, we show that a generalized
$\lambda$-duality, where $\lambda = 1 - q$ is the constant

which is essentially equivalent to the $q$-exponential family and has deep
connections with R\'{e}nyi entropy and optimal transport. Using this
generalized convex duality and its associated logarithmic divergence, we show
that our $\lambda$-exponential family satisfies properties that parallel and
generalize those of the exponential family. Under our framework, the R\'{e}nyi

Tsallis/R\'{e}nyi entropy maximizing property of the $q$-exponential family. We
also introduce a $\lambda$-mixture family which may be regarded as the dual of
the $\lambda$-exponential family, and connect it with other mixture-type

capture effective features from texts and the propagation structure. However,
the uncertainty caused by unreliable relations in the propagation structure is
common and inevitable due to wily rumor producers and the limited collection of
spread data. Most approaches neglect it and may seriously limit the learning of
features. Towards this issue, this paper makes the first attempt to explore
propagation uncertainty for rumor detection. Specifically, we propose a novel
Edge-enhanced Bayesian Graph Convolutional Network (EBGCN) to capture robust
structural features. The model adaptively rethinks the reliability of latent
relations by adopting a Bayesian approach. Besides, we design a new edge-wise
consistency training framework to optimize the model by enforcing consistency
on relations. Experiments on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that
the proposed model achieves better performance than baseline methods on both

form two-dimensional kagome layers. There is no magnetic order down to 50 mK
while the Curie-Weiss temperature is on the order of -100 K. At zero magnetic
field, the low-temperature specific heat shows a $T^2$ dependence. Above 2 T, a
linear temperature dependence term in specific heat emerges, and the value of
$\gamma = C/T$ increases linearly with the field. Furthermore, the magnetic
susceptibility tends to a constant value at $T = 0$. Our results suggest that
the magnetic ground state of YCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Br$_2$[Br$_{1-x}$(OH)$_{x}$] is
consistent with a Dirac quantum-spin-liquid state with a linearly dispersing
spinon strongly coupled to an emergent gauge field, which has long been

to extract features. Since the number of parameters increases quadratically
with the size of the convolution kernel, many popular models use small
convolution kernels, resulting in small local receptive fields in lower layers.
This paper proposes a novel log-polar space convolution (LPSC) method, where
the convolution kernel is elliptical and adaptively divides its local receptive
field into different regions according to the relative directions and
logarithmic distances. The local receptive field grows exponentially with the
number of distance levels. Therefore, the proposed LPSC not only naturally
encodes local spatial structures, but also greatly increases the single-layer
receptive field while maintaining the number of parameters. We show that LPSC
can be implemented with conventional convolution via log-polar space pooling
and can be applied in any network architecture to replace conventional
convolutions. Experiments on different tasks and datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed LPSC. Code is available at

further map to the target contrast image. To facilitate the translation between

hyper-encoder and hyper-decoder adaptive to different contrasts. We also design
a common space loss to enforce that multi-contrast images of a subject share a
common feature space, implicitly modeling the shared underlying anatomical

Hyper-GAN achieves state-of-the-art results in both accuracy and efficiency,

Current image reconstruction methods for dynamic MR imaging are mostly
retrospective that may not be suitable for i-MRI in real-time. Therefore, an
algorithm to reconstruct images without a temporal pattern as in dynamic
imaging is needed for i-MRI. Methods: We proposed a low-rank and sparsity (LS)
decomposition algorithm with framelet transform to reconstruct the
interventional feature with a high temporal resolution. Different from the
existing LS based algorithm, we utilized the spatial sparsity of both the
low-rank and sparsity components. We also used a primal dual fixed point (PDFP)
method for optimization of the objective function to avoid solving
sub-problems. Intervention experiments with gelatin and brain phantoms were
carried out for validation. Results: The LS decomposition with framelet
transform and PDFP could provide the best reconstruction performance compared
with those without. Satisfying reconstruction results were obtained with only
10 radial spokes for a temporal resolution of 60 ms. Conclusion and
Significance: The proposed method has the potential for i-MRI in many different
application scenarios.

seesaw mechanism in which one of the scalar triplets has a mass in a scale that
is accessible at the present generation colliders. Three SM singlet right
chiral fermions $\chi_{iR}$($i=e,\mu,\tau$) with $\rm B-L$ charges -4, -4, +5

these three fermions becomes a viable DM candidate as their stability is
guaranteed by a remnant $\mathcal Z_2$ symmetry to which $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ gauge
symmetry gets spontaneously broken. Interestingly in this scenario, the
neutrino mass and the co-annihilation of DM are interlinked through the
breaking of $U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ symmetry. Apart from giving rise to the observed
neutrino mass and dark matter abundance, the model also predicts exciting
signals at the colliders. Especially we see a significant enhancement in the

distributed training and data privacy protection, it still encounters many
obstacles. One of these is the naturally existing statistical heterogeneity
among clients, making local data distributions non independently and
identically distributed (i.e., non-iid), which poses challenges for model
aggregation and personalization. For FL with a deep neural network (DNN),
privatizing some layers is a simple yet effective solution for non-iid
problems. However, which layers should we privatize to facilitate the learning
process? Do different categories of non-iid scenes have preferred privatization
ways? Can we automatically learn the most appropriate privatization way during
FL? In this paper, we answer these questions via abundant experimental studies
on several FL benchmarks. First, we present the detailed statistics of these
benchmarks and categorize them into covariate and label shift non-iid scenes.
Then, we investigate both coarse-grained and fine-grained network splits and
explore whether the preferred privatization ways have any potential relations
to the specific category of a non-iid scene. Our findings are exciting, e.g.,
privatizing the base layers could boost the performances even in label shift
non-iid scenes, which are inconsistent with some natural conjectures. We also
find that none of these privatization ways could improve the performances on
the Shakespeare benchmark, and we guess that Shakespeare may not be a seriously
non-iid scene. Finally, we propose several approaches to automatically learn
where to aggregate via cross-stitch, soft attention, and hard selection. We
advocate the proposed methods could serve as a preliminary try to explore where
to privatize for a novel non-iid scene.

inferring players' behavior tendencies that contribute to the variations in
their decision-making behaviors. To that end, in this paper, we propose the use
of inverse Bayesian inference to infer behavior tendencies given a descriptive
cognitive model of a player's decision making. The model embeds behavior
tendencies as weight parameters in a player's decision-making. Inferences on
such parameters provide intuitive interpretations about a player's cognition
while making in-game decisions. We illustrate the use of inverse Bayesian
inference with synthetically generated data in a game called \textit{BoomTown}
developed by Gallup. We use the proposed model to infer a player's behavior
tendencies for moving decisions on a game map. Our results indicate that our
model is able to infer these parameters towards uncovering not only a player's
decision making but also their behavior tendencies for making such decisions.

the agent generates a different trajectory that achieves the same goal. We use

a bivariate TBE (BTBE) chart which is able to signal in real time. We derive
analytical expressions for the control limits and average time-to-signal

assets based on the current market conditions and other relevant information.
Recently, machine learning (ML) methods have become increasingly popular and
achieved promising results for price movement forecasting in both academia and
industry. Most existing ML solutions formulate the forecasting problem as a
classification (to predict the direction) or a regression (to predict the
return) problem over the entire set of training data. However, due to the
extremely low signal-to-noise ratio and stochastic nature of financial data,
good trading opportunities are extremely scarce. As a result, without careful
selection of potentially profitable samples, such ML methods are prone to
capture the patterns of noises instead of real signals. To address this issue,
we propose a novel price movement forecasting framework named LARA consisting
of two main components: Locality-Aware Attention (LA-Attention) and Iterative
Refinement Labeling (RA-Labeling). (1) LA-Attention automatically extracts the
potentially profitable samples by attending to label information. Moreover,
equipped with metric learning techniques, LA-Attention enjoys task-specific
distance metrics and effectively distributes attention to potentially
profitable samples. (2) RA-Labeling further iteratively refines the noisy
labels of potentially profitable samples, and combines the learned predictors
robust to the unseen and noisy samples. In a set of experiments on three
real-world financial markets: stocks, cryptocurrencies, and ETFs, LARA
significantly outperforms several machine learning based methods on the Qlib
quantitative investment platform. Extensive ablation studies and experiments
also demonstrate that LARA indeed captures more reliable trading opportunities.

two different class sets, a mixup module is re-proposed and integrated into the
meta-learning mechanism. Secondly, a novel disentangle module together with a

state is typically approximated as a simple spherically symmetric $ s $
orbital. This widely used $ s $ orbital approximation has failed in recent STM
studies where the measured STM images of subsurface impurity wave functions in
silicon required a detailed description of the STM tip electronic state. In
this work, we show that the failure of the $ s $ orbital approximation is due
to the indirect band-gap of the sample material silicon (Si), which gives rise
to complex valley interferences in the momentum space of impurity wave
functions. Based on direct comparison of STM images computed from
multi-million-atom electronic structure calculations of impurity wave functions
in direct (GaAs) and indirect (Si) band-gap materials, our results establish
that whilst the selection of STM tip orbital only plays a minor qualitative
role for the direct band gap GaAs material, the STM measurements are
dramatically modified by the momentum space features of the indirect band gap
Si material, thereby requiring a quantitative representation of the STM tip
orbital configuration. Our work provides new insights to understand future STM
studies of semiconductor materials based on their momentum space features,
which will be important for the design and implementation of emerging
technologies in the areas of quantum computing, photonics, spintronics and
valleytronics.

for the implementation of robust qubits. Amongst various concepts for scale-up,
the shared-control concept takes advantage of 3D scanning tunnelling microscope

the donors to be placed at the pitch limit of $\geq$30 nm, enabling dipole
interactions. A fundamental challenge is to exploit the faster exchange
interaction, however, the donor spacings required are typically 15 nm or less,
and the exchange interaction is notoriously sensitive to lattice site
variations in donor placement. This work presents a proposal for a fast
exchange-based surface-code quantum computer architecture which explicitly
addresses both donor placement imprecision commensurate with the
atomic-precision fabrication techniques and the stringent qubit pitch
requirements. The effective pitch is extended by incorporation of an
intermediate donor acting as an exchange-interaction switch. We consider both
global control schemes and a scheduled series of operations by designing GRAPE
pulses for individual CNOTs based on coupling scenarios predicted by atomistic
tight-binding simulations. The architecture is compatible with the existing

profiling results: common RW algorithms have as high as 73.1% CPU pipeline
slots stalled due to irregular memory access, which suffers significantly more
memory stalls than the conventional graph workloads such as BFS and SSSP. To
improve the memory efficiency, we first design a generic step-centric

Based on the programming model, we develop the step interleaving technique to
hide memory access latency by switching the executions of different random walk

PPR, DeepWalk, Node2Vec and MetaPath to demonstrate the efficiency and
programming flexibility of ThunderRW. Experimental results show that ThunderRW
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by an order of magnitude, and the step

suggest that the morphological quenching may dominate the star formation
activity of massive GV galaxies rather than the environmental quenching. To
quantify the correlation between the galaxy morphology and the star formation

expected to be a magnetic analogue of a Chern insulator with electrons replaced

between the original and augmented images. This paper introduces a novel
network design, noted as Augmentation Pathways (AP), to systematically
stabilize training on a much wider range of augmentation policies. Notably, AP
tames various heavy data augmentations and stably boosts performance without a
careful selection among augmentation policies. Unlike traditional single
pathway, augmented images are processed in different neural paths. The main
pathway handles the light augmentations, while other pathways focus on the
heavier augmentations. By interacting with multiple paths in a dependent
manner, the backbone network robustly learns from shared visual patterns among
augmentations, and suppresses the side effect of heavy augmentations at the
same time. Furthermore, we extend AP to high-order versions for high-order
scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and flexibility in practical usage.
Experimental results on ImageNet demonstrate the compatibility and

this work. The average spectrum over the entire duration exhibits a strong soft
X-ray excess above the power-law continuum. The soft X-ray excess is well
described by two thermal components with temperatures of kT_BB1 ~120 eV and
kT_BB2 ~460 eV. The warm thermal component is likely due to the presence of an
optically thick and warm Comptonizing plasma in the inner accretion disk. The
fractional variability amplitude is found to be decreasing with increasing
wavelength, i.e. from the soft X-ray to UV/optical emission. However, the hard
X-ray (2-8 keV) emission shows very low variability. The strength of the
correlation within the UV and the optical bands (0.95-0.99) is found to be
stronger than the correlation between the UV/Optical and X-ray bands
(0.40-0.53). These results clearly suggest that the emitting regions of the

removed the slow variations in the light curves, we find that the lag spectrum
is well described by the 4/3 rule for the standard Shakura-Sunyaev accretion

emission from a sample of hot magnetic stars, ranging from early-B to early-A
spectral type. Spanning a wide range of stellar parameters and wind properties,
these stars display a commonality in their radio emission which presents new
challenges to the wind scenario as originally conceived. It was thought that
relativistic electrons, responsible for the radio emission, originate in
current sheets formed where the wind opens the magnetic field lines. However,
the true mass-loss rates from the cooler stars are too small to explain the
observed non-thermal broadband radio spectra. Instead, we suggest the existence
of a radiation belt located inside the inner-magnetosphere, similar to that of
Jupiter. Such a structure explains the overall indifference of the broadband
radio emissions on wind mass-loss rates. Further, correlating the radio
luminosities from a larger sample of magnetic stars with their stellar
parameters, the combined roles of rotation and magnetic properties have been
empirically determined. Finally, our sample of early-type magnetic stars
suggests a scaling relationship between the non-thermal radio luminosity and
the electric voltage induced by the magnetosphere's co-rotation, which appears
to hold for a broader range of stellar types with dipole-dominated
magnetospheres (like the cases of the planet Jupiter and the ultra-cool dwarf
stars and brown dwarfs). We conclude that well-ordered and stable rotating
magnetospheres share a common physical mechanism for supporting the generation
of non-thermal electrons.

detector, to identify high-energy particles via the measurement of the
Cherenkov cone. However, the sensitivity and momentum coverage of such
detectors are intrinsically limited by the refractive index of the host
material. Especially, identifying particles with energy above multiple
gigaelectronvolts requires host materials with a near-unity refractive index,
which are often limited to large and bulky gas chambers. Overcoming this
fundamental material limit is important for future particle detectors yet
remains a long-standing scientific challenge. Here, we propose a different
paradigm for Cherenkov detectors that utilizes the broadband angular filter
made from stacks of variable one-dimensional photonic crystals. Owing to the
Brewster effect, the angular filter is transparent only to Cherenkov photons
from a precise incident angle, and particle identification is achieved by
mapping each Cherenkov angle to the peak-intensity position of transmitted
photons in the detection plane. This unique property of the angular filter is
exceptionally beneficial to Cherenkov detection as it enables the realization
of a non-dispersive pseudo refractive index over the entire visible spectrum.
Moreover, such a pseudo refractive index can be flexibly tuned to arbitrary
values, including those close to unity. Our angular-selective Brewster paradigm

Lacs) from the 3FGL sample and 64 Seyfert galaxies (3 Narrow-line, 34 and 27
regular Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 respectively) from the INTEGRAL survey to
statistically test the relationship between Seyfert galaxies and the blazar
samples of FSRQs and BL Lacs. We compute the synchrotron (SS), Compton (CS) and
inverse Compton (IC) continuous spectra from the low energy components of radio
to X-ray, radio to gamma-ray and the high energy component of X-ray to
gamma-ray bands, respectively. Results show from the distributions of the
continuous spectra that Seyfert galaxies form the tail of the distributions,
suggestive of similar underlying history and evolution. A two-sample
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K.S test) of the continuous spectra showed that
Seyfert galaxies differ from BL Lacs and FSRQs in the low energy components of
the spectra, while there is no clear difference between them in the high energy
component, which implies that high energy emissions in Seyfert galaxies, BL
Lacs and FSRQs may be as a result of the same emission mechanism. There is a
regular sequence of the distributions on SS/CS and IC/CS planes in each
individual subsample. Linear regression analyses of our sample yield
significant positive correlations (r greater than 0.60) between SS/CS and IC/CS
data. This upturns into an anti-correlation (r greater than -0.60) in IC/SS
data. These results are not only consistent with unified scheme for blazars but
also show that Seyfert galaxies can be unified with the classical radio-loud
AGNs counterparts.

We observe considerable suppression at $\Delta\phi_{\gamma D}\sim\pi$ and
enhancement at $\Delta\phi_{\gamma D}<2.8$ in $\gamma+$D azimuthal angular
distribution in $0-10\%$ Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$5.02 TeV compared
to the p+p baseline, which indicates evident in-medium $P_T$-broadening of
charm quarks. We also find that the overall modification patterns of $\gamma+$D
angular distribution are sensitive to the selection cut of D meson $p_T$.
Furthermore, by constructing the 2D ($x_{J}^{\gamma D}, \Delta\phi_{\gamma D}$)
correlation diagram, it's possible to display the respective impacts of the two
aspects of jet quenching, energy loss and $P_T$-broadening, on the final-state
$\gamma+$D observable simultaneously. Additionally, we find weaker angular
de-correlations of $\gamma+$B compared to $\gamma+$D which may be helpful to
understand the mass hierarchy in heavy-ion collisions. Finally, the nuclear

evaluate the performances of linguistic features by measuring their accuracy on
an automatic speech recognition task. In addition, we estimate speaker and

diagnosis challenging. Thus, rapid and accurate risk stratification is of
paramount importance. High-risk PE is caused by right ventricular (RV)
dysfunction from acute pressure overload, which in return can help identify
which patients require more aggressive therapy. Reconstructed four-chamber
views of the heart on chest CT can detect right ventricular enlargement. CT
pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the golden standard in the diagnostic workup of
suspected PE. Therefore, it can link between diagnosis and risk stratification
strategies. We developed a weakly supervised deep learning algorithm, with an
emphasis on a novel attention mechanism, to automatically classify RV strain on
CTPA. Our method is a 3D DenseNet model with integrated 3D residual attention
blocks. We evaluated our model on a dataset of CTPAs of emergency department

characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.88 for classifying RV strain. The model showed
a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 83.7%. Our solution outperforms

construction of a new type of posterior distributions, that extends the
classical Bayes one, for estimating the law of an $n$-sample. The loss
functions we have in mind are based on the total variation and Hellinger
distances as well as some $\mathbb{L}_{j}$-ones. We prove that, with a
probability close to one, this new posterior distribution concentrates its mass
in a neighbourhood of the law of the data, for the chosen loss function,
provided that this law belongs to the support of the prior or, at least, lies
close enough to it. We therefore establish that the new posterior distribution
enjoys some robustness properties with respect to a possible misspecification
of the prior, or more precisely, its support. For the total variation and
squared Hellinger losses, we also show that the posterior distribution keeps
its concentration properties when the data are only independent, hence not
necessarily i.i.d., provided that most of their marginals or the average of
these are close enough to some probability distribution around which the prior
puts enough mass. The posterior distribution is therefore also stable with
respect to the equidistribution assumption. We illustrate these results by
several applications. We consider the problems of estimating a location
parameter or both the location and the scale of a density in a nonparametric
framework. Finally, we also tackle the problem of estimating a density, with
the squared Hellinger loss, in a high-dimensional parametric model under some
sparsity conditions. The results established in this paper are non-asymptotic

non-linear Brownian motion, displays a really complex behaviour when quenched
to low temperatures. Its glassy response is controlled by a long-lived
non-equilibrium state, independent of the degree of non-linearity and also of
the Brownian-Brownian collisions rate. The latter property entails that this
behaviour persists in the collisionless case, where the fluid is described by
the non-linear Fokker-Planck equation. The observed response, which includes
non-exponential, algebraic, relaxation and strong memory effects, presents
scaling properties: the time evolution of the temperature -- for both
relaxation and memory effects -- falls onto a master curve, regardless of the

the kinetic equation -- which considers not only the fourth cumulant but also

There are three novel features in the present work; namely, (i) the delta
function singularity is naturally removed, (ii) level set function is
introduced as a feature input, (iii) it is completely shallow, comprising only
one hidden layer. We first introduce the energy functional of the problem and
then transform the contribution of singular sources to a regular surface
integral along the interface. In such a way, the delta function singularity can
be naturally removed without introducing a discrete one that is commonly used
in traditional regularization methods, such as the well-known immersed boundary
method. The original problem is then reformulated as a minimization problem. We
propose a shallow Ritz-type neural network with one hidden layer to approximate
the global minimizer of the energy functional. As a result, the network is
trained by minimizing the loss function that is a discrete version of the
energy. In addition, we include the level set function of the interface as a

still open problems, specially for unknown attacks scenarios. In order to
improve the robustness of biometric systems, it is crucial to improve PAD

Unfortunately, the capture and creation of presentation attack instruments and
even the capture of bona fide images is sometimes complex to achieve. This
paper proposes a novel PAI synthetically created (SPI-PAI) using four
state-of-the-art GAN algorithms (cGAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP, and StyleGAN2) and a
small set of periocular NIR images. A benchmark between GAN algorithms is
performed using the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) between the generated

algorithm was not able to detect the synthetic images as a Presentation Attack,
categorizing all of them as bona fide. Such results demonstrated the

policy development, ecosystem services, urban planning and agriculture
monitoring, which are mainly generated from remote sensing image classification
techniques. Traditional land cover classification usually needs tremendous
computational resources, which often becomes a huge burden to the remote
sensing community. Undoubtedly cloud computing is one of the best choices for
land cover classification, however, if not managed properly, the computation
cost on the cloud could be surprisingly high. Recently, cutting the unnecessary
computation long tail has become a promising solution for saving the cost in
the cloud. For land cover classification, it is generally not necessary to
achieve the best accuracy and 85% can be regarded as a reliable land cover
classification. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework for
cost-effective remote sensing classification. Given the desired accuracy, the
clustering algorithm can stop early for cost-saving whilst achieving sufficient
accuracy for land cover image classification. Experimental results show that
achieving 85%-99.9% accuracy needs only 27.34%-60.83% of the total cloud
computation cost for achieving a 100% accuracy. To put it into perspective, for
the US land cover classification example, the proposed approach can save over
$1,593,490.18 for the government in each single-use when the desired accuracy
is 90%.

near-infrared photometry of SN 2019hcc, which resides in a host galaxy at
redshift 0.044, displaying a sub-solar metallicity. The supernova spectrum near
peak epoch shows a `w' shape at around 4000 {\AA} which is usually associated
with O II lines and is typical of Type I superluminous supernovae. SN 2019hcc
post-peak spectra show a well-developed H alpha P-Cygni profile from 19 days
past maximum and its light curve, in terms of its absolute peak luminosity and
evolution, resembles that of a fast-declining Hydrogen-rich supernova (SN IIL).
The object does not show any unambiguous sign of interaction as there is no
evidence of narrow lines in the spectra or undulations in the light curve. Our
tardis spectral modelling of the first spectrum shows that Carbon, Nitrogen and
Oxygen (CNO) at 19000 K reproduce the `w' shape and suggests that a combination
of non-thermally excited CNO and metal lines at 8000 K could reproduce the
feature seen at 4000 {\AA}. The Bolometric light curve modelling reveals that
SN 2019hcc could be fit with a magnetar model, showing a relatively strong
magnetic field (B > 3 x 10^14 G), which matches the peak luminosity and rise
time without powering up the light curve to superluminous luminosities. The
high-energy photons produced by the magnetar would then be responsible for the
detected O II lines. As a consequence, SN 2019hcc shows that a `w' shape
profile at around 4000 {\AA}, usually attributed to O II, is not only shown in
superluminous supernovae and hence it should not be treated as the sole
evidence of the belonging to such a supernova type.

require low-latency clocking schemes. In a previous study, we proposed a
low-latency clocking scheme called delay-line clocking, in which the latency
for each logic operation is determined by the propagation delay of the
excitation current, and demonstrated a simple AQFP buffer chain that adopts
delay-line clocking. However, it is unclear whether more complex AQFP circuits

gates (AND and XOR gates) that use delay-line clocking as a step towards
implementing large-scale AQFP circuits with delay-line clocking. AND and XOR
gates with a latency of approximately 20 ps per gate are shown to operate at up
to 5 and 4 GHz, respectively, in experiments. We also demonstrate that
delay-line clocking enables phase skipping operation, in which some of the AQFP
buffers for phase synchronization are removed to reduce the junction count and
energy dissipation. The results indicate that delay-line clocking can enable

important way to improve the model performance in many applications because

continuous features are usually transformed to the power forms by adding a new
feature to allow it to easily form non-linear functions of the feature.
However, this kind of feature engineering heavily relies on peoples experience
and it is both time consuming and labor consuming. On the other side, concise
CTR model with both fast online serving speed and good model performance is
critical for many real life applications. In this paper, we propose LeafFM
model based on FM to generate new features from the original feature embedding
by learning the transformation functions automatically. We also design three
concrete Leaf-FM models according to the different strategies of combing the

standard FMs by a large margin. Compared with FFMs, Leaf-FM can achieve
significantly better performance with much less parameters. In Avazu and

Leaf-FM has the same computation complexity with FM in online serving phase and
it means Leaf-FM is applicable in many industry applications because of its
better performance and high computation efficiency.

for each feature in this way. In this paper, We propose a novel CTR Framework
named ContextNet that implicitly models high-order feature interactions by
dynamically refining each feature's embedding according to the input context.
Specifically, ContextNet consists of two key components: contextual embedding
module and ContextNet block. Contextual embedding module aggregates contextual
information for each feature from input instance and ContextNet block maintains
each feature's embedding layer by layer and dynamically refines its
representation by merging contextual high-order interaction information into

  Aims. We attempt to detect variations in ion temperature and vertical plasma
flows, which are driven by impulsively excited two-fluid Alfv\'en waves. We aim
to investigate the possible contribution of these waves to solar chromosphere
heating and plasma outflows. Methods. We performed numerical simulations of the
generation and evolution of Alfv\'en waves with the use of the JOANNA code,
which solves the two-fluid equations for ions+electrons and neutrals, coupled
by collision terms.
  Results. We confirm that the damping of impulsively generated small-amplitude
Alfv\'en waves slightly affects the temperature of the chromosphere and
generates slow plasma flows. In contrast, the Alfv\'en waves generated by
large-amplitude pulses increase the chromospheric plasma temperature more
significantly and result in faster plasma outflows. The maximum heating occurs
when the pulse is launched from the central photosphere, and the magnitude of
the related plasma flows grows with the amplitude of the pulse.
  Conclusions. Large-amplitude two-fluid Alfv\'en waves can contribute

practical applications, since they provide significant information for acoustic
scene analysis. As both tasks share complementary qualities, ensuring efficient
interaction between these two is crucial for a complete picture of an aural

joint proximity and direction estimation from binaural recordings, both defined
as coarse classification problems based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).
Considering the limitations of binaural audio, we propose two methods of
splitting the sphere into angular areas in order to obtain a set of directional
classes. For each method we study different model types to acquire information
about the direction-of-arrival (DoA). Finally, we propose various ways of
combining the proximity and direction estimation problems into a joint task
providing temporal information about the onsets and offsets of the appearing

due to their economic efficiency. Their economic viability depends to a large
extent on the resulting product quality and the associated customer
satisfaction as well as on possible downtimes. In particular, the occurrence of
increased tool wear reduces the product quality and leads to downtimes, which
is why considerable research has been carried out in recent years with regard
to wear detection. While processes have widely been monitored based on force
and acceleration signals, a new approach is pursued in this paper. Blanked
workpieces manufactured by punches with 16 different wear states are

surprisingly high accuracy, opening up new possibilities and research

candidate OCs and look for new OCs near the candidate groups. Gaia data also
permitted filtering out most of the field sources that are not member stars of
the OCs. The plotting of combined colour-magnitude diagrams of candidate pairs
has allowed, in several cases, endorsing or discarding their link. The most

properties, showing how the low abundance of $^{13}$C generated below the
convective envelope hampers the formation of primary $^{14}$N and the ensuing
synthesis of intermediate-mass nuclei, like $^{19}$F and $^{22}$Ne. In the
mentioned models, their production is therefore of a purely secondary nature.
Shortage of primary $^{22}$Ne has also important effects in reducing the
neutron density. Another property concerns AGB winds, which are likely to
preserve C-rich subcomponents, isolated by magnetic tension, even when the
envelope composition is O-rich. Conditions for the formation of C-rich
compounds are therefore found in stages earlier than previously envisaged.
These issues, together with the uncertainties related to several nuclear
physics quantities, are discussed in the light of the isotopic admixtures of
s-process elements in presolar SiC grains of stellar origin, which provide
important and precise constraints to the otherwise uncertain parameters. By
comparing nucleosynthesis results with measured SiC data, it is argued that
such a detailed series of constraints indicates the need for new measurements
of weak interaction rates in ionized plasmas, as well as of neutron-capture
cross sections, especially near the N = 50 and N = 82 neutron magic numbers.
Nontheless, the peculiarity of our models allows us to achieve fits to the

Solvated ions have a profound
effect on the behavior of ionic solutions, which is crucial in nature and
technology. Experimentally, ions have been classified into ""structure makers""
or ""structure breakers"", depending on whether they slow down or accelerate the
solution dynamics. Theoretically, the dynamics of ions has been explained by a
dielectric friction model combining hydrodynamics and charge-dipole interaction
in the continuum description. However, both approaches lack a microscopic
structural basis, leaving the microscopic understanding of salt effects
unclear. Here we elucidate unique microscopic features of solvation of
spherical ions by computer simulations. We find that increasing the ion
electric field causes a sharp transitional decrease in the hydration-shell
thickness, signaling the ion mobility change from the Stokes to dielectric
friction regime. The dielectric friction regime can be further divided into two
due to the competition between the water-water hydrogen bonding and ion-water
electrostatic interactions: Whether the former or latter prevails determines
whether the water dynamics are accelerated or decelerated. In the ion-water
interaction predominant regime, a specific combination of ion size and charge
stabilizes the hydration shell via orientational-symmetry breaking, reminiscent
of the Thomson problem for the electron configuration of atoms. Notably, the
hydration-shell stability is much higher for a composite coordination number
than a prime one, a prime-number effect on solvent dynamics. These findings are
fundamental to the structure breaker/maker concept and provide new insights
into the solvent structure and dynamics beyond the continuum model, paving the
way towards a microscopic theory of ionic solutions.

certification of ML-based safety-critical systems, as well as the solutions
that are proposed in the literature to tackle them, answering the question 'How

the main pillars of ML certification: Robustness, Uncertainty, Explainability,

analyzed the main trends and problems of each sub-field and provided summaries
of the papers extracted.
  Results: The SLR results highlighted the enthusiasm of the community for this
subject, as well as the lack of diversity in terms of datasets and type of
models. It also emphasized the need to further develop connections between
academia and industries to deepen the domain study. Finally, it also
illustrated the necessity to build connections between the above mention main

  Conclusion: We highlighted current efforts deployed to enable the
certification of ML based software systems, and discuss some future research
directions.

evaluation of patients. However, the common operation in clinical brain tumor
segmentation is still manual segmentation, lead to its time-consuming and large
performance difference between different operators, a consistent and accurate
automatic segmentation method is urgently needed. Methods: To meet the above
challenges, we propose an automatic brain tumor MRI data segmentation framework
which is called AGSE-VNet. In our study, the Squeeze and Excite (SE) module is
added to each encoder, the Attention Guide Filter (AG) module is added to each
decoder, using the channel relationship to automatically enhance the useful
information in the channel to suppress the useless information, and use the
attention mechanism to guide the edge information and remove the influence of
irrelevant information such as noise. Results: We used the BraTS2020 challenge
online verification tool to evaluate our approach. The focus of verification is
that the Dice scores of the whole tumor (WT), tumor core (TC) and enhanced
tumor (ET) are 0.68, 0.85 and 0.70, respectively. Conclusion: Although MRI
images have different intensities, AGSE-VNet is not affected by the size of the
tumor, and can more accurately extract the features of the three regions, it
has achieved impressive results and made outstanding contributions to the
clinical diagnosis and treatment of brain tumor patients.

unsolved problem. As the photosphere and chromosphere radiate more energy than
the solar corona, it is challenging but important to reveal all the mechanisms
that contribute to plasma heating there. Ion-neutral collisions could play an
important role. Aims. We aim to investigate the impulsively generated two-fluid
magnetoacoustic waves in the partially ionized solar chromosphere and to study
the associated heating and plasma outflows, which higher up may result in
nascent solar wind. Methods. To describe the plasma dynamics, we applied a
two-fluid model in which ions+electrons and neutrals are treated as separate
fluids. We solved the two-fluid equations numerically using the JOANNA code.
Results. We show that magnetoacoustic waves triggered in the photosphere by
localised velocity pulses can steepen into shocks which heat the chromosphere
through ion-neutral collisions. Pulses of greater amplitude heat plasma more
effectively and generate larger plasma outflows. Rising the altitude at which
the pulse is launched results in opposite effects, mainly in local cooling of
the chromosphere and slower plasma outflows. Conclusions. Even a solitary pulse
results in a train of waves. These waves can transform into shock waves and
release thermal energy, heating the chromosphere significantly. A pulse can
drive vertical flows which higher up can result in the origin of the solar
wind.

measure neural network robustness to distribution shifts. However, robustness
to synthetic corruption benchmarks is not always predictive of robustness to

propose a methodology to build synthetic corruption benchmarks that make
robustness estimations more correlated with robustness to real-world
distribution shifts. Using the overlapping criterion, we split synthetic
corruptions into categories that help to better understand neural network
robustness. Based on these categories, we identify three relevant parameters to
take into account when constructing a corruption benchmark that are the (1)
number of represented categories, (2) their relative balance in terms of size
and, (3) the size of the considered benchmark. In doing so, we build new
synthetic corruption selections that are more predictive of robustness to

execution time of evolutionary algorithms by utilizing parallel computing. An
asynchronous PEA (APEA) is a scheme of PEAs that increases computational
efficiency by generating a new solution immediately after a solution evaluation
completes without the idling time of computing nodes. However, because APEA
gives more search opportunities to solutions with shorter evaluation times, the
evaluation time bias of solutions negatively affects the search performance. To
overcome this drawback, this paper proposes a new parent selection method to
reduce the effect of evaluation time bias in APEAs. The proposed method
considers the search frequency of solutions and selects the parent solutions so
that the search progress in the population is uniform regardless of the
evaluation time bias. This paper conducts experiments on multi-objective
optimization problems that simulate the evaluation time bias. The experiments
use NSGA-III, a well-known multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, and compare
the proposed method with the conventional synchronous/asynchronous
parallelization. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method can
reduce the effect of the evaluation time bias while reducing the computing time
of the parallel NSGA-III.

understanding, which aims to learn a joint embedding space where related video

the video-text similarity based on video-level and text-level embeddings.
However, the neglect of more fine-grained or local information causes the
problem of insufficient representation. Some works exploit the local details by
disentangling sentences, but overlook the corresponding videos, causing the
asymmetry of video-text representation. To address the above limitations, we
propose a Hierarchical Alignment Network (HANet) to align different level
representations for video-text matching. Specifically, we first decompose video
and text into three semantic levels, namely event (video and text), action
(motion and verb), and entity (appearance and noun). Based on these, we
naturally construct hierarchical representations in the individual-local-global
manner, where the individual level focuses on the alignment between frame and
word, local level focuses on the alignment between video clip and textual
context, and global level focuses on the alignment between the whole video and
text. Different level alignments capture fine-to-coarse correlations between
video and text, as well as take the advantage of the complementary information
among three semantic levels. Besides, our HANet is also richly interpretable by
explicitly learning key semantic concepts. Extensive experiments on two public
datasets, namely MSR-VTT and VATEX, show the proposed HANet outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods, which demonstrates the effectiveness of hierarchical
representation and alignment. Our code is publicly available.

behaviour of surface Li7 and rotation as well as the internal rotation profiles
inferred from helio- and asteroseismology in F- and G-type main sequence stars.
We apply the model for the transport of angular momentum and chemicals that we
tailored in a previous work for solar-type stars to an extended range of
initial masses and metallicities corresponding to F- an G-type stars in a
sample of 20 Galactic open clusters. We evaluate its ability to explain the
Li7, Be9, and rotation periods observations. Over the entire range of masses,
metallicities, and ages explored, we reproduce the evolution of the surface
rotation rates and predict, for the first time, the observed anti-correlation
between the surface rotation rate and Li7 depletion as a consequence of the
penetrative convection prescription. However, the ability of the model to
reproduce the so-called Li7 dip centred around 6600K strongly depends on the
adopted prescriptions for shear turbulence. It also requires a stellar mass
dependence for the viscosity adopted for the transport of angular momentum,
similar to the behaviour predicted for the generation and luminosity of
internal gravity waves generated by stellar convective envelopes. We provide an
efficient way to model G-type stars of different ages and metallicities
successfully. However, the Li7 and Be9 dip constraints call for further
hydrodynamical studies to better model turbulence in stars.

performance can yield stronger correlations with human data than the agent's
average performance. Both additions consistently improve the prediction
accuracy, and the DRL-enhanced MCTS outperforms both DRL and vanilla MCTS in
the hardest levels. We conclude that player modelling via automated playtesting
can benefit from combining DRL and MCTS. Moreover, it can be worthwhile to
investigate a subset of repeated best AI agent runs, if AI gameplay does not

immediate consequence of the gap is that the static density-density response
function of the charged channel vanishes as $q^2$ for wave vector $q \to 0$,
rather than linearly in $q$, as commonly expected. In this sense, the system is
{\it incompressible}. This feature, which has no analogue in the classical
electron-hole plasma, is consistent with the existence of an excitonic ground
state and implies the existence of a discontinuity in the chemical potential of
electrons and holes when the numbers of electrons and holes are equal. It
should be experimentally observable by monitoring the densities of electrons

spectroscopic Ca II data from the Dunn Solar Telescope and vector magnetic
field observations from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) to
investigate thermal enhancements in a sunspot light bridge. The photospheric
magnetic field from HMI was extrapolated to the corona using a non-force-free
field technique that provided the three-dimensional distribution of electric
currents, while an inversion of the chromospheric Ca II line with a local
thermodynamic equilibrium and a nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium spectral
archive delivered the temperature stratifications from the photosphere to the
chromosphere. Results: We find that the light bridge is a site of strong
electric currents, of about 0.3 A/m^2 at the bottom boundary, which extend to
about 0.7 Mm while decreasing monotonically with height. These currents produce
a chromospheric temperature excess of about 600-800 K relative to the umbra.
Only the light bridge, where relatively weak and highly inclined magnetic
fields emerge over a duration of 13 hr, shows a spatial coincidence of thermal
enhancements and electric currents. The temperature enhancements and the
Cowling heating are primarily confined to a height range of 0.4-0.7 Mm above

provide direct evidence for currents heating the lower solar chromosphere

using Fermi/LAT (0.1--300 GeV) observations. We studied decade-long
observations applying various analysis tools such as flux distribution,
symmetry analysis, and RMS-flux relation. It was found that the $\gamma$-ray
flux distribution closely resembles a log-normal probability distribution
function and can be characterized by linear RMS-flux relation. The power
spectral density analysis shows the statistical variability properties of the
sources as studied are consistent with flicker noise, an indication of
long-memory processes at work. Statistical analysis of the distribution of flux
rise and decay rates in the light curves of the sources, aimed at
distinguishing between particle acceleration and energy-dissipation timescales,
counter-intuitively suggests that both kinds of rates follow a similar
distribution and the derived mean variability timescales are on the order of a
few weeks. The corresponding emission region size is used to constrain the
location of $\gamma$-ray production sites in the sources to be a few parsecs.
Additionally, using Lomb-Scargle periodogram and weighted wavelet z-transform
methods and extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we detected year-timescale
quasi-periodic oscillations in the sources S5 0716+714, Mrk 421, ON +325, PKS
1424-418, and PKS 2155-304. We also performed recurrence quantification
analysis of the sources and directly measure the deterministic quantities,
which suggest that the dynamical processes in blazars could be a combination of
deterministic and stochastic processes, while some of the source light curves
revealed significant deterministic content.

systematic rejection of counter-informational press in a separate cluster which
hardly receives any attention from the mainstream media. Counter-informational
sub-spaces are also peripheral on the consumption side. We measure their

discrepancy between both social networks, with counter-information space, far
right and far left media gathering limited audiences. Finally, we also measure
the ideological distribution of news stories using Twitter data, which also
suggests that the French media landscape is quite balanced. We therefore
conclude that the French media ecosystem does not suffer from the same level of
polarization as the US media ecosystem. The comparison with the American
situation also allows us to consolidate a result from studies on
disinformation: the polarization of the journalistic space and the circulation
of fake news are phenomena that only become more widespread when dominant and
influential actors in the political or journalistic space spread topics and
dubious content originally circulating in the fringe of the information space.

new entrants have been recorded since the new violence erupted on 25 August
2017 in the Rakhine state of Myanmar.1 However, such crisis is nothing new in
Bangladesh, nor are the security-related challenges new that such an exodus
brings with it. Ever since the military came to power in Myanmar (in 1962),
Rohingya exodus to neighboring countries became a recurring incident. The
latest mass exodus of Rohingyas from Rakhine state of Myanmar to Bangladesh is
the largest of such influxes. Unlike, the previous refugee crisis, the ongoing
crisis has wide-ranging security implications on Bangladesh. They are also
varied and multifaceted. Thus, responsibilities for ensuring effective
protection have become operationally multilateral. The problem of security
regarding the Rohingya refugee issue is complicated by the Islamist insurgency,
illicit methamphetamine/yaba drug trafficking, and HIV/AIDS/STI prevalence
factors. The chapter examines the different dimensions of security challenges
that the recent spell of Rohingya exodus brings to Bangladesh and the refugees
themselves. In order to understand the challenges, firstly the chapter attempts
to conceptualize the prominent security frameworks. Secondly, it examines the
context and political economy behind the persecution of Rohingyas in the

However, a salient problem still hinders practical deployment -- prior arts
mostly struggle with recognising unseen (or rarely seen) character sequences.
In this paper, we put forward a novel framework to specifically tackle this
""unseen"" problem. Our framework is iterative in nature, in that it utilises
predicted knowledge of character sequences from a previous iteration, to
augment the main network in improving the next prediction. Key to our success
is a unique cross-modal variational autoencoder to act as a feedback module,
which is trained with the presence of textual error distribution data. This
module importantly translate a discrete predicted character space, to a
continuous affine transformation parameter space used to condition the visual
feature map at next iteration. Experiments on common datasets have shown
competitive performance over state-of-the-arts under the conventional setting.
Most importantly, under the new disjoint setup where train-test labels are
mutually exclusive, ours offers the best performance thus showcasing the
capability of generalising onto unseen words.

(ABA). Our main objective is to online transfer input frames to their natural
motion-blurred counterparts while misleading the state-of-the-art trackers
during the tracking process. To this end, we first design the motion blur
synthesizing method for visual tracking based on the generation principle of
motion blur, considering the motion information and the light accumulation
process. With this synthetic method, we propose optimization-based ABA (OP-ABA)
by iteratively optimizing an adversarial objective function against the
tracking w.r.t. the motion and light accumulation parameters. The OP-ABA is
able to produce natural adversarial examples but the iteration can cause heavy
time cost, making it unsuitable for attacking real-time trackers. To alleviate
this issue, we further propose one-step ABA (OS-ABA) where we design and train
a joint adversarial motion and accumulation predictive network (JAMANet) with
the guidance of OP-ABA, which is able to efficiently estimate the adversarial
motion and accumulation parameters in a one-step way. The experiments on four

  Distillation","IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Text recognition remains a fundamental and extensively researched topic in
computer vision, largely owing to its wide array of commercial applications.
The challenging nature of the very problem however dictated a fragmentation of
research efforts: Scene Text Recognition (STR) that deals with text in everyday
scenes, and Handwriting Text Recognition (HTR) that tackles hand-written text.
In this paper, for the first time, we argue for their unification -- we aim for
a single model that can compete favourably with two separate state-of-the-art
STR and HTR models. We first show that cross-utilisation of STR and HTR models
trigger significant performance drops due to differences in their inherent
challenges. We then tackle their union by introducing a knowledge distillation
(KD) based framework. This is however non-trivial, largely due to the
variable-length and sequential nature of text sequences, which renders
off-the-shelf KD techniques that mostly works with global fixed-length data
inadequate. For that, we propose three distillation losses all of which are
specifically designed to cope with the aforementioned unique characteristics of
text recognition. Empirical evidence suggests that our proposed unified model
performs on par with individual models, even surpassing them in certain cases.
Ablative studies demonstrate that naive baselines such as a two-stage
framework, and domain adaption/generalisation alternatives do not work as well,
further verifying the appropriateness of our design.

state-of-the-art (SOTA) models still struggle in the wild scenarios due to

In this paper, we argue that semantic information offers a complementary role
in addition to visual only. More specifically, we additionally utilize semantic
information by proposing a multi-stage multi-scale attentional decoder that
performs joint visual-semantic reasoning. Our novelty lies in the intuition
that for text recognition, the prediction should be refined in a stage-wise
manner. Therefore our key contribution is in designing a stage-wise unrolling
attentional decoder where non-differentiability, invoked by discretely
predicted character labels, needs to be bypassed for end-to-end training. While
the first stage predicts using visual features, subsequent stages refine on top
of it using joint visual-semantic information. Additionally, we introduce
multi-scale 2D attention along with dense and residual connections between
different stages to deal with varying scales of character sizes, for better
performance and faster convergence during training. Experimental results show
our approach to outperform existing SOTA methods by a considerable margin.

work, we report our extensive study on the linear scaling relation (LSR)
between oxygen (O), a group VIA element with elements of neighbouring groups
such as: Group IIIA (Boron (B), Aluminum (Al)), IVA (Carbon (C), Silicon (Si)),
VA (Nitrogen(N),phosphorus(P)) and VIIA (Florine(F)) on magnetic bimetallic
surfaces. We found that the slope is positive for only O versus N and F,
remaining of the slopes are negative. The present model is based on multiple
surface descriptors, particularly spin-averaged d-band center and the surface's
magnetic moment, whereas the original scaling theory (Phys. Rev. Lett. 99,
016105 (2007)) was based on a single adsorbate descriptor: adsorbate valency.

technique based on variational Bayesian inference. The methods were compared
for two experimental tasks: image-based and video-based (i.e. patient-based)

accuracy 92.1% and 90.3% for the first and second task, respectively. A
significant advantage of the proposed technique is that it does not require the

bias, which damages the robustness and generalization performance of these

a confounder which misleads the system to learn the spurious correlation. To
alleviate the negative effects brought by the dataset bias, we propose a novel
Interventional Emotion Recognition Network (IERN) to achieve the backdoor
adjustment, which is one fundamental deconfounding technique in causal
inference. Specifically, IERN starts by disentangling the dataset-related
context feature from the actual emotion feature, where the former forms the
confounder. The emotion feature will then be forced to see each confounder
stratum equally before being fed into the classifier. A series of designed
tests validate the efficacy of IERN, and experiments on three emotion

research in modern optics, largely due to the opportunities offered by the
simultaneous resonant control of electric and magnetic components of light at
the nanoscale. In this rapidly evolving scenario, the possibility to design
artificial Huygens sources by overlapping electric and magnetic resonances has
established a new paradigm in flat optics, bringing devices closer to efficient
wavefront shaping with a direct phase engineering at the level of the
individual meta-atoms. However, their efficiency is fundamentally limited by
the near field coupling between the constituents of the metalattice. In this
work, we challenge this well-conceived notion and propose an alternative
concept to achieve phase control and full transmission in metasurfaces, based
on the unusual properties of the nonradiating sources known as Hybrid Anapoles
(HAs). We analyze theoretically an array of such sources and demonstrate that
HAs are characterized by a negligible coupling with their neighbors. Therefore,
in contrast to Huygens particles, the proposed sources can operate as
individual meta-atoms even in highly compact designs, becoming robust against
strong disorder and preserving its characteristics when deposited on dielectric
substrates. Remarkably, the phase of the transmitted wave can be modulated with
negligible reflection. To illustrate the capabilities of our platform, we also
utilize a disordered HA array to implement a controlled phase modulation to an
ultrafast gaussian pulse. The results of our study represent a departure from
the currently established designs and open an avenue towards the realization of
new devices for flat optics with unprecedented efficiency.

interacting elements. While edges capture the topology of direct interactions,
the true complexity of many systems originates from higher-order patterns in
paths by which nodes can indirectly influence each other. Path data,
representing ordered sequences of consecutive direct interactions, can be used
to model these patterns. On the one hand, to avoid overfitting, such models
should only consider those higher-order patterns for which the data provide
sufficient statistical evidence. On the other hand, we hypothesise that network
models, which capture only direct interactions, underfit higher-order patterns
present in data. Consequently, both approaches are likely to misidentify
influential nodes in complex networks. We contribute to this issue by proposing
five centrality measures based on MOGen, a multi-order generative model that
accounts for all indirect influences up to a maximum distance but disregards
influences at higher distances. We compare MOGen-based centralities to
equivalent measures for network models and path data in a prediction experiment
where we aim to identify influential nodes in out-of-sample data. Our results
show strong evidence supporting our hypothesis. MOGen consistently outperforms
both the network model and path-based prediction. We further show that the
performance difference between MOGen and the path-based approach disappears if
we have sufficient observations, confirming that the error is due to
overfitting.

adopted from other domains. However, data in the field of physics are unique in
the context of machine learning, insofar as their generation process and the
laws and symmetries they abide by are usually well understood. Most commonly
used deep learning architectures fail at utilizing this available information.
In contrast, more traditional likelihood-based methods are capable of
exploiting domain knowledge, but they are often limited by computational
complexity. In this contribution, a hybrid approach is presented that utilizes
generative neural networks to approximate the likelihood, which may then be
used in a traditional maximum-likelihood setting. Domain knowledge, such as
invariances and detector characteristics, can easily be incorporated in this
approach. The hybrid approach is illustrated by the example of event
reconstruction in IceCube.

dark charges on binary black holes. After testing our framework in simulations,

potentially be detected through the precise timing of an array of millisecond
pulsars. This background produces low-frequency noise in the pulse arrival
times that would have a characteristic spectrum common to all pulsars and a
well-defined spatial correlation. Recently the North American Nanohertz
Observatory for Gravitational Waves collaboration (NANOGrav) found evidence for
the common-spectrum component in their 12.5-year data set. Here we report on a
search for the background using the second data release of the Parkes Pulsar
Timing Array. If we are forced to choose between the two NANOGrav models
$\unicode{x2014}$ one with a common-spectrum process and one without
$\unicode{x2014}$ we find strong support for the common-spectrum process.
However, in this paper, we consider the possibility that the analysis suffers
from model misspecification. In particular, we present simulated data sets that
contain noise with distinctive spectra but show strong evidence for a
common-spectrum process under the standard assumptions. The Parkes data show no
significant evidence for, or against, the spatially correlated Hellings-Downs
signature of the gravitational-wave background. Assuming we did observe the
process underlying the spatially uncorrelated component of the background, we
infer its amplitude to be $A = 2.2^{+0.4}_{-0.3} \times 10^{-15}$ in units of
gravitational-wave strain at a frequency of $1\, \text{yr}^{-1}$. Extensions
and combinations of existing and new data sets will improve the prospects of
identifying spatial correlations that are necessary to claim a detection of the
gravitational-wave background.

contribute to healing current dependence on non-sustainable energy sources.
Recently, triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have gained visibility as new
mechanical energy harvester offering a valid alternative to batteries, being
particularly suitable for portable devices. Here, the increased capacitance of
a few-layer graphene-based electrode is obtained by incorporating
nitrogen-doped graphene (N_graphene), enabling a 3_fold enhancement in TENGs
power output. The dependence of TENGs performance on the electronic properties
of different N_graphene types, varying in the doping concentration and in the
relative content of N-pyridinic and N-graphitic sites is investigated. These
sites have different electron affinities, and synergistically contribute to the
variation of the capacitive and resistive properties of N-graphene and
consequently, TENG performance. It is demonstrated that the power enhancement
of the TENG occurs when the N_graphene, an n-semiconductor, is interfaced
between the positive triboelectric material and the electrode, while a
deterioration of the electrical performance is observed when it is placed at
the interface with the negative triboelectric material. This behavior is
explained in terms of the dependence of N_graphene quantum capacitance on the
electrode chemical potential which shifts according to the opposite
polarization induced at the two electrodes upon triboelectrification.

reorganization of the repertoire. This plasticity of the repertoire drives the
emergence of distinct regimes for the size and diversity of the memory pool,

significant correlation and a scaling law with exponent $\alpha\sim 0.5$

circular chromatic number of $(G, \sigma)$, denoted $\chi_c(G, \sigma)$, is the
infimum of $r$ such that $(G, \sigma)$ admits a circular $r$-coloring.
  This notion is recently defined by Naserasr, Wang, and Zhu who, among other
results, proved that for any signed $d$-degenerate simple graph $\hat{G}$ we
have $\chi_c(\hat{G})\leq 2d$. For $d\geq 3$, examples of signed $d$-degenerate
simple graphs of circular chromatic number $2d$ are provided. But for $d=2$
only examples of signed 2-degenerate simple graphs of circular chromatic number
close enough to $4$ are given, noting that these examples are also signed

  In this work we first observe the following restatement of the 4-color
theorem: If $(G,\sigma)$ is a signed bipartite planar simple graph where
vertices of one part are all of degree 2, then $\chi_c(G,\sigma)\leq
\frac{16}{5}$. Motivated by this observation, we provide an improved upper
bound of $ 4-\dfrac{2}{\lfloor \frac{n+1}{2} \rfloor}$ for the circular

improved upper bound of $ 4-\dfrac{4}{\lfloor \frac{n+2}{2} \rfloor}$ for the

of two holes with one electron, have recently been observed in transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and drawn increasing attention due to potential
applications of these materials in light-emitting diodes, valleytronic devices
as well as for being a testbed for understanding many-body phenomena.
Therefore, it is important to enhance the trion emission and its stability. In
this study, we construct a MoSe2/FePS3 van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH)
with type-I band alignment, which allows for carriers injection from FePS3 to
MoSe2. At low temperatures, the neutral exciton (X0) emission in this vdWH is
almost completely suppressed. The ITrion/Ix0 intensity ratio increases from
0.44 in a single MoSe2 monolayer to 20 in this heterostructure with the trion
charging state changing from negative in the monolayer to positive in the
heterostructure. The optical pumping with circularly polarized light shows a
14% polarization for the trion emission in MoSe2/FePS3. Moreover, forming such
type-I vdWH also gives rise to a 20-fold enhancement of the room temperature
photoluminescence from monolayer MoSe2. Our results demonstrate a novel
approach to convert excitons to trions in monolayer 2D TMDCs via interlayer
doping effect using type-I band alignment in vdWH.

water-repellency as obtained by chemisorption of strongly bound hydrophobic
molecules at surfaces. Here we present experiments and computer simulations on
the wetting behavior of water on molecularly thin, self-assembled alkane
carpets of dotriacontane (n-C32H66 or C32) physisorbed on the hydrophilic
native oxide layer of silicon surfaces during dip-coating from a binary alkane
solution. By changing the dip-coating velocity we control the initial C32
surface coverage and achieve distinct film morphologies, encompassing
homogeneous coatings with self-organised nanopatterns that range from dendritic
nano-islands to stripes. These patterns exhibit a good water wettability even
though the carpets are initially prepared with a high coverage of hydrophobic
alkane molecules. Using in-liquid atomic force microscopy, along with molecular
dynamics simulations, we trace this to a rearrangement of the alkane layers
upon contact with water. This restructuring is correlated to the morphology of
the C32 coatings, i.e. their fractal dimension. Water molecules displace to a
large extent the first adsorbed alkane monolayer and thereby reduce the
hydrophobic C32 surface coverage. Thus, our experiments evidence that water
molecules can very effectively hydrophilize initially hydrophobic surfaces that
consist of weakly bound hydrocarbon carpets.

the electrical resistance of the superconducting nanowires is always non-zero

two-dimensional XY model can mimic the superconducting transition temperature
Tc and the BKT transition at a lower critical temperature TBKT by observing the

this issue, we apply an artificial-intelligence technique to split the nearly

lip tightener are distinct action units, they appear correlated in the training

disentangled editing of such action units by computing detached regions of
influence for each action unit, and restrict editing to these regions. We
validate the effectiveness of our local editing method through perception

islands, is of interest for both the design of future smart grids, and as a
last resort to restore power dispatchment in sections of a grid affected by an
extreme failure. In the literature this problem is usually solved by turning it
into a combinatorial optimization problem, often solved through generic
heruristic methods such as Genetic Algorithms or Tabu Search. In this paper, we
take a different route and obtain the grid partition by exploiting the
synchronization dynamics of a cyberlayer of Kuramoto oscillators, each
parameterized as a rough approximation of the dynamics of the grid's node it
corresponds to. We present first a centralised algorithm and then a
decentralised strategy. In the former, nodes are aggregated based on their
internode synchronization times while in the latter they exploit
synchronization of the oscillators in the cyber layer to selforganise into

Schwarzschild black hole. We find that the corresponding
Eddington-Finkelstein-like coordinate admits two time-coordinate singularities
for a particular condition. This condition is due to the existence of a
non-zero angular momentum related to the extra spatial dimension. By
introducing a new Regge-Wheeler tortoise coordinate, both singularities can be
removed from the Eddington-Finkelstein-like coordinate. It is identified that
the additional singularity is related to the photon sphere in a hyperplane, and
we analyze it using a dynamical system approach. Simulation results of photon
motion based on numerical calculation are presented. It is suggested that the
related bending motion characteristic can probably be considered as a signature
for probing the existence of the extra spatial dimension.

achieve higher steganalysis effects. However, we have found through experiments
that there actually exists significant difference between automatically

distribution of individual words. Such kind of difference can be naturally
captured by the language model used for generating stego texts. Through further
experiments, we conclude that this ability can be transplanted to a text
classifier by pre-training and fine-tuning to improve the detection
performance. Motivated by this insight, we propose two methods for efficient
linguistic steganalysis. One is to pre-train a language model based on RNN, and
the other is to pre-train a sequence autoencoder. The results indicate that the
two methods have different degrees of performance gain compared to the randomly
initialized RNN, and the convergence speed is significantly accelerated.
Moreover, our methods achieved the best performance compared to related works,

chromospheric evaporation-coronal condensation model has been confirmed by
numerical simulations to explain the formation of filament threads very well in
flux tubes with single dips. However, coronal magnetic extrapolations indicated
that some magnetic field lines might possess more than one dip. It is expected
that the formation process would be significantly different in this case
compared to a single-dipped magnetic flux tube. In this paper, based on the
evaporation-condensation model, we study filament thread formation in
double-dipped magnetic flux tubes by numerical simulations. We find that only
with particular combinations of magnetic configuration and heating, e.g.,
concentrated localized heating and a long magnetic flux tube with deep dips,
can two threads form and persist in a double-dipped magnetic flux tube.
Comparing our parametric survey with observations, we conclude that such
magnetically connected threads due to multiple dips are more likely to exist in
quiescent filaments than in active-region filaments. Moreover, we find that
these threads are usually shorter than independently trapped threads, which
might be one of the reasons why quiescent filaments have short threads. These
characteristics of magnetically connected threads could also explain barbs and
vertical threads in quiescent filaments.

dataset, namely D0 in terms of the macro-average precision (MPre), the
macro-average recall (MRec), the macro-average F1- score (MF1), the accuracy

methods that are used in realistic settings to ensure the dependability of AI
systems.
  Method: A systematic literature review resulted in 90 papers. Systems

and applied validation methods.
  Results: The validation methods were synthesized into a taxonomy consisting
of trial, simulation, model-centred validation, and expert opinion. Failure

deployment.
  Conclusions: Our results clarify existing strategies applied to validation.

classifier is used to classify the internet traffic. The experimental results
show that the proposed hybrid deep learning algorithm is effective and achieved

are a polynomial of degree at most four in the site index. We show how to
obtain an asymptotic approximation for the R\'enyi entanglement entropy of all
such chains in a constant magnetic field at half filling by exploiting their
connection with the conformal field theory of a massless Dirac fermion in a
suitably curved static background. We study the above approximation for three
particular chains in the family, two of them related to well-known
quasi-exactly solvable quantum models on the line and the third one to
classical Krawtchouk polynomials, finding an excellent agreement with the exact
value obtained numerically when the R\'enyi parameter $\alpha$ is less than
one. When $\alpha\ge1$ we find parity oscillations, as expected from the
homogeneous case, and show that they are very accurately reproduced by a
modification of the Fagotti-Calabrese formula. We have also analyzed the
asymptotic behavior of the R\'enyi entanglement entropy in the non-standard
situation of arbitrary filling and/or inhomogeneous magnetic field. Our
numerical results show that in this case a block of spins at each end of the
chain becomes disentangled from the rest. Moreover, the asymptotic
approximation for the case of half filling and constant magnetic field, when
suitably rescaled to the region of non-vanishing entropy, provides a rough
approximation to the entanglement entropy also in this general case.

manually, in English--German (EN--DE) and English--Chinese (EN--ZH). We show
that the ability of neural machine translation (NMT) models to translate
negation has improved with deeper and more advanced networks, although the
performance varies between language pairs and translation directions. The
accuracy of manual evaluation in EN-DE, DE-EN, EN-ZH, and ZH-EN is 95.7%,
94.8%, 93.4%, and 91.7%, respectively. In addition, we show that
under-translation is the most significant error type in NMT, which contrasts
with the more diverse error profile previously observed for statistical machine
translation. To better understand the root of the under-translation of
negation, we study the model's information flow and training data. While our
information flow analysis does not reveal any deficiencies that could be used
to detect or fix the under-translation of negation, we find that negation is
often rephrased during training, which could make it more difficult for the
model to learn a reliable link between source and target negation. We finally
conduct intrinsic analysis and extrinsic probing tasks on negation, showing
that NMT models can distinguish negation and non-negation tokens very well and
encode a lot of information about negation in hidden states but nevertheless
leave room for improvement.

frequency spectrum is rich, consisting of two doublets and one quintuplet,
which we interpret to be oblique pulsation multiplets from consecutive,
high-overtone dipole, quadrupole and dipole modes. The central frequency of the
quintuplet is 232.7701d$^{-1}$ (2.694 mHz). The phases of the sidelobes, the
pulsation phase modulation, and a spherical harmonic decomposition all show
that the quadrupole mode is distorted. Following the oblique pulsator model, we
calculate the rotation inclination, i, and magnetic obliquity, $\beta$, of this
star, which provide detailed information about the pulsation geometry. The i
and $\beta$ derived from the best fit of the pulsation amplitude and phase
modulation to a theoretical model, including the magnetic field effect,
slightly differ from those calculated for a pure quadrupole, indicating the
contributions from l = 4, 6, 8, ... are small. Non-adiabatic models with
different envelope convection conditions and physics configurations were
considered for this star. It is shown that models with envelope convection
almost fully suppressed can explain the excitation at the observed pulsation

the light-dark-cycles can be detected and the mixing characteristic of the flow
besides its mass transport is analyzed. The radiative transport model is
deployed to predict the local light intensities according to wavelength of the
light and scattering characteristic of the culture. The third submodel
implements the biomass growth kinetic, by coupling the local light intensities
to hydrodynamic information of CO2 concentration, to predict the algal growth.
The developed mesoscopic simulation model is applied to a tubular PBR with

Our refinement method introduces few extra parameters and significantly reduces
the difficulty of modeling channel-wise topologies. Furthermore, via
reformulating graph convolutions into a unified form, we find that CTR-GC
relaxes strict constraints of graph convolutions, leading to stronger
representation capability. Combining CTR-GC with temporal modeling modules, we
develop a powerful graph convolutional network named CTR-GCN which notably
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and

which outputs triplets of an aspect target, its associated sentiment, and the
corresponding opinion term. Recent models perform the triplet extraction in an
end-to-end manner but heavily rely on the interactions between each target word
and opinion word. Thereby, they cannot perform well on targets and opinions
which contain multiple words. Our proposed span-level approach explicitly
considers the interaction between the whole spans of targets and opinions when
predicting their sentiment relation. Thus, it can make predictions with the
semantics of whole spans, ensuring better sentiment consistency. To ease the
high computational cost caused by span enumeration, we propose a dual-channel
span pruning strategy by incorporating supervision from the Aspect Term
Extraction (ATE) and Opinion Term Extraction (OTE) tasks. This strategy not
only improves computational efficiency but also distinguishes the opinion and
target spans more properly. Our framework simultaneously achieves strong
performance for the ASTE as well as ATE and OTE tasks. In particular, our
analysis shows that our span-level approach achieves more significant
improvements over the baselines on triplets with multi-word targets or

full-duplex (FD) mode. For the D2D link under consideration, we first formulate
the mode selection problem-whereby D2D pair could either communicate directly,
or, through the BSmC, or, through the BSMC-as a ternary hypothesis testing
problem. Next, to compute the effective capacity (EC) for the given D2D link,
we assume that the channel state information (CSI) is not available at the
transmit D2D node, and hence, it transmits at a fixed rate r with a fixed
power. This allows us to model the D2D link as a Markov system with six-states.
We consider both overlay and underlay modes for the D2D link. Moreover, to
improve the throughput of the D2D link, we assume that the D2D pair utilizes
two special automatic repeat request (ARQ) schemes, i.e., Hybrid-ARQ (HARQ) and
truncated HARQ. Furthermore, we consider two distinct queue models at the
transmit D2D node, based upon how it responds to the decoding failure at the
receive D2D node. Eventually, we provide closed-form expressions for the EC for
both HARQ-enabled D2D link and truncated HARQ-enabled D2D link, under both
queue models. Noting that the EC looks like a quasi-concave function of r, we
further maximize the EC by searching for an optimal rate via the
gradient-descent method. Simulation results provide us the following insights:
i) EC decreases with an increase in the QoS exponent, ii) EC of the D2D link
improves when HARQ is employed, iii) EC increases with an increase in the
quality of self-interference cancellation techniques used at BSmC and BSMC in

scholarly research evaluation as well as in bibliometric analysis. However,
this classification is not standardized, resulting in several different journal
subject classification systems. In this study, we adopt a logical set
theory-based definition of irregularities within a given classification system
and discrepancies between systems and investigate their prevalence in the two
most widely used indexing services of Web of Science (WoS) and Scopus. In both
systems, we identify unusually sized categories, high overlap and
incohesiveness between categories. In addition, across the two systems,
journals are systematically classified to a different number of categories and
most categories in either system are not adequately represented in the other
system. Our findings suggest that these irregularities and discrepancies are,
in fact, non-anecdotal and thus cannot be easily disregarded. Consequently,
potentially misguided and/or inconsistent outcomes may be encountered when
relying on these subject classification systems.

learning, that one can a-priori use to scale any embedding technique. Our
local2global approach proceeds by first dividing the input graph into
overlapping subgraphs (or ""patches"") and training local representations for
each patch independently. In a second step, we combine the local
representations into a globally consistent representation by estimating the set
of rigid motions that best align the local representations using information
from the patch overlaps, via group synchronization. A key distinguishing
feature of local2global relative to existing work is that patches are trained
independently without the need for the often costly parameter synchronisation
during distributed training. This allows local2global to scale to large-scale
industrial applications, where the input graph may not even fit into memory and
may be stored in a distributed manner. Preliminary results on medium-scale data
sets (up to $\sim$7K nodes and $\sim$200K edges) are promising, with a graph
reconstruction performance for local2global that is comparable to that of
globally trained embeddings. A thorough evaluation of local2global on large
scale data and applications to downstream tasks, such as node classification
and link prediction, constitutes ongoing work.

crossover from a three to a two-dimensional behavior as the gap size decreases.
Indeed, the prototypical two-dimensional hexatic phase only occurs in liquids
confined to a monolayer. Here, we demonstrate that the dimensionality crossover
is apparent in the lateral size dependence of the relaxation dynamics of
confined liquids, developing a Debye model for the density of vibrational
states of confined systems and performing extensive numerical simulations. In
confined systems, Mermin-Wagner fluctuations enhance the amplitude of
vibrational motion or Debye-Waller factor by a quantity scaling as the inverse
gap width and proportional to the logarithm of the aspect ratio, as a clear
signature of a two-dimensional behaviour. As the temperature or lateral system
size increases, the crossover to a size-independent relaxation dynamics occurs
when structural relaxation takes place before the vibrational modes with the
longest wavelength develop.

Virtualization (NFV) is a new paradigm for changing the way networks are built
and operated. Decoupling software implementation from network resources through
a virtualization layer introduces a need for developing sets of NFV management
and orchestration (MANO) functions. We discuss how this new point of view is
highly inspired by the functional programming concepts. We provide examples and
exercises on Open Stack virtual technology, and also discuss the challenges and
problems inspired by telecommunication industry. Focus is on Reliable operation
of Management and Orchestration functions of Virtualized resources.
  These notes provide an introduction to the subject, with the goal of
explaining the necessity for new knowledge and skills in area of network
programming. We introduce students with main problems and the network design
principles, methods and techniques used for their solution. The worked examples
and exercises serve students as the teaching material, from which they can
learn how to use functional programming to effectively and efficiently

interpretations as possible evidence of a primordial stochastic
gravitational-wave background (SGWB) stronger than predicted by standard
inflation+LCDM. Such an SGWB would contribute an extra radiation component to
the background Universe which may affect its expansion history. As such, it may
help alleviate the current Hubble tension, a novel connection between
gravitational waves and cosmology. We demonstrate this by considering a
cosmological model, the ""standard inflation + stiff amplification"" scenario,
with two components added to the LCDM model: a stiff component (w=1) and the
primordial SGWB. Previously, we showed that even for standard inflation, the
SGWB may be detectable at the high frequencies probed by laser interferometers,
if it is amplified by a possible early stiff era after reheating. Models that
boost the SGWB enough to cause significant backreaction, however, must still
preserve the well-measured radiation-matter equality, as precision cosmology
demands. For that, we calculate the fully-coupled evolution of the SGWB and
expansion history, sampling parameter space (tensor-to-scalar ratio, reheating
temperature and temperature at stiff-to-radiation equality). We then perform a
joint analysis of the NANOGrav results and latest upper bounds from Planck, big
bang nucleosynthesis and Advanced LIGO-Virgo, to constrain the model. The
resulting blue-tilted, stiff-amplified SGWB is still too small to explain the
NANOGrav results. However, if someday, Advanced LIGO-Virgo detects the SGWB,
our model can explain it within standard inflation (without requiring an
initial blue tilt). Meanwhile, this model may bring current high-z measurements
of the Hubble constant within 3.4 sigma of the low-z measurements by SH0ES
(from 4.4 sigma) and within 2.6 sigma of those by H0LiCOW (from 3.1 sigma),
reducing the tension.

construction of the moduli stack $\mathcal{W}_n$ of Weierstrass fibrations over
an unparameterized $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ with discriminant degree $12n$ and a

fibrations is a separated Deligne-Mumford stack over any base field $K$ with
$\mathrm{char}(K) \neq 2,3$ and not dividing $n$. Arithmetically, for the

determine its motive in the Grothendieck ring of stacks to be

person-to-person contact patterns over time in response to the COVID-19

of thousands of anonymous individuals in four US states and empirically show
the dramatic disruption in people's life. We find that local interventions did
not just impact the number of visits to different venues but also how people
experience them. Individuals spend less time in venues, preferring simpler and
more predictable routines and reducing person-to-person contact activities.
Moreover, we show that the stringency of interventions alone does explain the
number and duration of visits to venues: individual patterns of visits seem to
be influenced by the local severity of the pandemic and a risk adaptation
factor, which increases the people's mobility regardless of the stringency of
interventions.

grading systems utilized outside the sciences to assist tuition in the Arts. It
also represents the first system built and tested in an African context across

design and implementation of AutoGrad. AutoGrad employs APIs to download the
assignments from the course platform, performs static and dynamic analysis on
the assignment to evaluate the graphical output of the program, and returns the
grade and feedback to the student. It then evaluates AutoGrad by analyzing data
collected from the two online cohorts of 1000+ students of our SuaCode
smartphone-based course. From the analysis and students' feedback, AutoGrad is
shown to be adequate for automatic assessment, feedback provision to students,

quantum states that they consume. When analyzing architecture implementations
of quantum hardware, characterizing this quality forms an important factor in
understanding their performance. Fundamental characteristics of quantum
hardware lead to inherent tradeoffs between the quality of states and
traditional performance metrics such as throughput. Furthermore, any real-world
implementation of quantum hardware exhibits time-dependent noise that degrades
the quality of quantum states over time. Here, we study the performance of two
possible architectures for interfacing a quantum processor with a quantum
network. The first corresponds to the current experimental state of the art in
which the same device functions both as a processor and a network device. The
second corresponds to a future architecture that separates these two functions
over two distinct devices. We model these architectures as Markov chains and
compare their quality of executing quantum operations and producing entangled
quantum states as functions of their memory lifetimes, as well as the time that
it takes to perform various operations within each architecture. As an
illustrative example, we apply our analysis to architectures based on
Nitrogen-Vacancy centers in diamond, where we find that for present-day device
parameters one architecture is more suited to computation-heavy applications,
and the other for network-heavy ones. Besides the detailed study of these
architectures, a novel contribution of our work are several formulas that
connect an understanding of waiting time distributions to the decay of quantum
quality over time for the most common noise models employed in quantum
technologies. This provides a valuable new tool for performance evaluation
experts, and its applications extend beyond the two architectures studied in
this work.

interest in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. It is widely assumed that
Bayesian neural networks (BNN) are well suited for this task, as the endowed
epistemic uncertainty should lead to disagreement in predictions on outliers.
In this paper, we question this assumption and provide empirical evidence that
proper Bayesian inference with common neural network architectures does not
necessarily lead to good OOD detection. To circumvent the use of approximate
inference, we start by studying the infinite-width case, where Bayesian
inference can be exact considering the corresponding Gaussian process.
Strikingly, the kernels induced under common architectural choices lead to
uncertainties that do not reflect the underlying data generating process and
are therefore unsuited for OOD detection. Finally, we study finite-width
networks using HMC, and observe OOD behavior that is consistent with the
infinite-width case. Overall, our study discloses fundamental problems when
naively using BNNs for OOD detection and opens interesting avenues for future
research.

orthogonal states of a qubit by coupling with an ancilla. The qubit undergoes
Landau-Zener dynamics, whereas the coupling realizes a time-dependent
Hamiltonian, which is diagonal in the spin's instantaneous Landau-Zener
eigenstates. The ancilla (or meter), in turn, couples to a thermal bath, such
that the overall dynamics is incoherent. We analyse the protocol's fidelity as
a function of the strength of the coupling and of the relaxation rate of the
meter. When the meter's decay rate is the largest frequency scale of the
dynamics, the spin dynamics is encompassed by a master equation describing
dephasing of the spin in the instantaneous eigenbasis. In this regime the
fidelity of adiabatic transfer improves as the bath temperature is increased.
Surprisingly, the adiabatic transfer is significantly more efficient in the
opposite regime, where the time scale of the ancilla dynamics is comparable to
the characteristic spin time scale. Here, for low temperatures the coupling
with the ancilla tends to suppress diabatic transitions via effective cooling.
The protocol can be efficiently implemented by means of a pulsed, stroboscopic
coupling with the ancilla and is robust against moderate fluctuations of the
experimental parameters.

homogeneous normal phase (far away from n = 1/2), or a PS between normal phases
with different densities (close to n = 1/2). Further increasing temperature to
Tps, the PS disappears and the particle-hole symmetry of the Hamiltonian is
recovered. For repulsive interaction, depending on electron filling, the ground

provide Pareto-optimal plans trading off between material waste, fabrication
time, precision, and other considerations. However, when developing fabrication
plans, experts rarely restrict to a single design, instead considering families
of design variations, sometimes adjusting designs to simplify fabrication.
Jointly exploring the design and fabrication plan spaces for each design is
intractable using current techniques. We present a new approach to jointly
optimize design and fabrication plans for carpentered objects. To make this
bi-level optimization tractable, we adapt recent work from program synthesis
based on equality graphs (e-graphs), which encode sets of equivalent programs.
Our insight is that subproblems within our bi-level problem share significant
substructures. By representing both designs and fabrication plans in a new bag
of parts(BOP) e-graph, we amortize the cost of optimizing design components
shared among multiple candidates. Even using BOP e-graphs, the optimization
space grows quickly in practice. Hence, we also show how a feedback-guided
search strategy dubbed Iterative Contraction and Expansion on E-graphs(ICEE)
can keep the size of the e-graph manage-able and direct the search toward
promising candidates. We illustrate the advantages of our pipeline through

understanding of light scalar and pseudoscalar mesons (up to around 2 GeV) and
thereby explore the underlying mixings among composite quark matter fields and
glueballs. The chiral sector of the Lagrangian is formulated in terms of two
chiral nonets representing quark-antiquarks and tetraquarks (in the leading
order, this sector contains terms with eight or fewer number of quak or
antiquark lines). The Lagrangian also contains a sector that represents scalar
and pseudoscalar glueballs and their interactions with the matter chiral
fields, in a manner that the axial and trace anomalies of QCD are exactly
realized. In this construct, the model has two scalar octets and two
pdeudoscalar octets (each a linear combination of two- and four-quark
components), as well as three scalar SU(3) singlets and three pseudoscalar
SU(3) singlets (each a linear combination of two- and four-quark components as
well as a glueball component). With the inputs of the experimental masses of
$a_0(980)$, $a_0(1450)$, and the masses of $\pi(137)$, $\pi(1300)$ and their
decay constants, we perform an extensive numerical simulation to determine the
boundaries of the parameter space of the model. We further incorporate
experimental data on the mass spectrum of eta states as well as on several
decay widths and decay ratios of $f_0$ states to zoom in on the parameter space

octets and singlets as well as for the pseudoscalar and scalar glueball masses.
We find the scalar and pseudoscalar glueball masses around 1.6 and 2.0 GeV,

Time is of the essence, as the longer that the process takes and the more that
atoms are moved, the higher the chance that atoms will be lost in the process.
  Viewed as a problem on graphs, we wish to solve the problem of reconfiguring
one arrangement of tokens (representing atoms) to another using as few moves as

number of tokens, the number of moves, or the number of moves plus the number
of vertices without tokens in either the source or target configuration, but
intractable when parameterizing by the difference between the number of moves

electronic properties, it is inferred that zigzag-Xene nanoribbons are
promising materials for topological electronics with a display of unique
physical characteristics associated with the intrinsic band topology and the
finite-size effects on gate-induced topological switching. First, due to
intertwining with intrinsic band topology-driven energy-zero modes in the
pristine case, spin-filtered chiral edge states in zigzag-Xene nanoribbons
remain gapless and protected against backward scattering even with finite
inter-edge overlapping in ultra-narrow ribbons, i.e., a 2D quantum spin Hall
material turns into a 1D topological metal. Second, mainly due to width- and
momentum-dependent tunability of the gate-induced inter-edge coupling, the
threshold-voltage required for switching between gapless and gapped edge states
reduces as the width decreases, without any fundamental lower bound. Third,
when the width of zigzag-Xene nanoribbons is smaller than a critical limit,
topological switching between edge states can be attained without bulk bandgap
closing and reopening. This is primarily due to the quantum confinement effect
on the bulk band spectrum which increases the nontrivial bulk bandgap with
decrease in width. The existence of such protected gapless edge states and
reduction in threshold-voltage accompanied by enhancement in the bulk bandgap
overturns the general wisdom of utilizing narrow-gap and wide channel materials
for reducing the threshold-voltage in a standard field effect transistor
analysis and paves the way toward low-voltage topological devices.

either global contractions or turbulent-like extensile dynamics, depending on
the concentrations of both microtubules and a bundling agent. We also observe a
range of spatially heterogeneous non-equilibrium phases, including finite-sized
radial asters, 1D wormlike chains, extended 2D bilayers, and system-spanning 3D

microphase separated structures and arise from the inherent frustration between
the orientational order of filamentous microtubules and the positional order of

traditional deep learning frameworks, since they provide higher computational
efficiency in event driven neuromorphic hardware. However, the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) SNNs suffer from high inference latency, resulting from inefficient
input encoding and training techniques. The most widely used input coding
schemes, such as Poisson based rate-coding, do not leverage the temporal
learning capabilities of SNNs. This paper presents a training framework for
low-latency energy-efficient SNNs that uses a hybrid encoding scheme at the
input layer in which the analog pixel values of an image are directly applied
during the first timestep and a novel variant of spike temporal coding is used
during subsequent timesteps. In particular, neurons in every hidden layer are
restricted to fire at most once per image which increases activation sparsity.
To train these hybrid-encoded SNNs, we propose a variant of the gradient
descent based spike timing dependent back propagation (STDB) mechanism using a
novel cross entropy loss function based on both the output neurons' spike time
and membrane potential. The resulting SNNs have reduced latency and high
activation sparsity, yielding significant improvements in computational
efficiency. In particular, we evaluate our proposed training scheme on image
classification tasks from CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets on several VGG
architectures. We achieve top-1 accuracy of $66.46$\% with $5$ timesteps on the
CIFAR-100 dataset with ${\sim}125\times$ less compute energy than an equivalent
standard ANN. Additionally, our proposed SNN performs $5$-$300\times$ faster

simulations of the Hegselmann-Krause model: Under some circumstances, making
agents more closed-minded can produce a consensus from a dense configuration of
opinions which otherwise leads to fragmentation. Suppose one considers initial
opinions equally spaced on an interval of length $L$. As first observed by
Lorenz, simulations suggest that there are three intervals $[0, L_1)$, $(L_1,
L_2)$ and $(L_2, L_3)$, with $L_1 \approx 5.23$, $L_2 \approx 5.67$ and $L_3
\approx 6.84$ such that, when the number of agents is sufficiently large,
consensus occurs in the first and third intervals, whereas for the second
interval the system fragments into three clusters. In this paper, we prove
consensus for $L \leq 5.2$ and for $L$ sufficiently close to 6. These proofs
include large computations and in principle the set of $L$ for which consensus
can be proven using our approach may be extended with the use of more computing
power. We also prove that the set of $L$ for which consensus occurs is open.
Moreover, we prove that, when consensus is assured for the equally spaced
systems, this in turn implies asymptotic almost sure consensus for the same
values of $L$ when initial opinions are drawn independently and uniformly at
random. We thus conjecture a pair of phase transitions, making precise the
formulation of Lorenz's ""consensus strikes back"" hypothesis. Our approach makes
use of the continuous agent model introduced by Blondel, Hendrickx and
Tsitsiklis. Indeed, one contribution of the paper is to provide a presentation
of the relationships between the three different models with equally spaced,

understood and arise in a variety of applications, however, the time-varying
equations have not yet been fully explored in the literature. In this article
we provide a self-contained study of discrete time Riccati matrix difference
equations. In particular, we provide a novel Riccati semigroup duality formula
and a new Floquet-type representation for these equations. Due to the
aperiodicity of the underlying flow of the solution matrix, conventional
Floquet theory does not apply in this setting and thus further analysis is
required. We illustrate the impact of these formulae with an explicit
description of the solution of time-varying Riccati difference equations and
its fundamental-type solution in terms of the fixed point of the equation and
an invertible linear matrix map, as well as uniform upper and lower bounds on
the Riccati maps. These are the first results of this type for time varying
Riccati matrix difference equations.

more activity is undertaken, the more calories will have been burned by the end
of the day. Yet traditional hunter-gatherers, who lead physically hard lives,
burn no more calories each day than western populations living in labour-saving
environments. Indeed, there is now a wealth of data, both for humans and other
animals, demonstrating that long-term lifestyle changes involving increases in
exercise or other physical activities do not result in commensurate increases
in daily energy expenditure (DEE). This is because humans and other animals
exhibit a degree of energy compensation at the organismal level, ameliorating
some of the increases in DEE that would occur from the increased activity by
decreasing the energy expended on other biological processes. And energy
compensation can be sizable, reaching many hundreds of calories in humans. But
the processes that are downregulated in the long-term to achieve energy
compensation are far from clear, particularly in humans. We do not know how
energy compensation is achieved. My review here of the literature on relevant
exercise intervention studies, for both humans and other species, indicates
conflict regarding the role that basal metabolic rate (BMR) or low level
activity such as fidgeting play, if any, particularly once changes in body
composition are factored out. In situations where BMR and low-level activity
are not major components of energy compensation, what then drives it? I discuss
how changes in mitochondrial efficiency and changes in circadian fluctuations
in BMR may contribute to our understanding of energy management. Currently
unexplored, these mechanisms and others may provide important insights into the
mystery of how energy compensation is achieved.

phenomena such as unidirectional propagation of electromagnetic waves resilient
to backscattering at sharp bends and disorder-immune localization of light at

(HOTIs) bring in additional degrees of control over light confinement and
steering. However, designs of photonic HOTIs reported so far are solely
exploiting lattice geometries which are hard to reconfigure thus limiting
tunability. Here, we elaborate a conceptually new mechanism to engineer
higher-order topological phases which relies on the dual nature of
electromagnetic field and exploits both electric and magnetic responses of the
meta-atoms. Hybridization between these responses gives rise to the difference
in the effective coupling which is controlled by the meta-atoms mutual
orientations. This feature facilitates us to tailor photonic band topology
exclusively via particle alignment and to flexibly reconfigure the topological
phase. Focusing on the kagome array of split-ring resonators, we experimentally
demonstrate topological edge and corner states in the microwave domain. Our
findings provide a new promising route to induce and control higher-order
topological phases and states.

Purcell presented a basic explanation of the magnetic
force experienced by a test charge moving parallel to a stationary
current-carrying wire. According to Purcell's derivation, this force results
from the difference between the relativistic length contraction of the distance
among the stationary positive charges of the wire and the relativistic length
contraction of the distance among the negative charges moving in the wire, when
the charges are observed in the rest frame of the test charge. The contraction
difference generates a charge density unbalance that in the rest frame of the
test charge is experienced as an electrostatic force, while in the lab frame is
perceived as the magnetic force. In the present paper, we show that Purcell's
approach is problematic since it generates inconsistencies and paradoxes. We
maintain that Purcell's derivation has only an illustrative and expository
value and should not be taken literally as describing something that really and
physically happens in the wire. Furthermore, we believe that the difficulties
pointed out here should be explicitly presented and discussed when introducing
Purcell's approach in physics courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels.
