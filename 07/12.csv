  denominators","16 pages",,,,"math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A unit fraction representation of a rational number $r$ is a finite sum of
reciprocals of positive integers that equals $r$. Of particular interest is the
case when all denominators in the representation are distinct, resulting in an
Egyptian fraction representation of $r$. Common algorithms for computing
Egyptian fraction representations of a given rational number tend to result in
extremely large denominators and cannot be adapted to restrictions on the
allowed denominators. We describe an algorithm for finding all unit fraction
representations of a given rational number using denominators from a given
finite multiset of positive integers. The freely available algorithm,
implemented in Scheme, is particularly well suited to computing dense Egyptian
fraction representations, where the allowed denominators have a prescribed
maximum.

structures with geometric nonlinearity, with a special emphasis on the
techniques based on invariant manifold theory. Nonlinear methods differ from
linear based techniques by their use of a nonlinear mapping instead of adding
new vectors to enlarge the projection basis. Invariant manifolds have been
first introduced in vibration theory within the context of nonlinear normal
modes (NNMs) and have been initially computed from the modal basis, using
either a graph representation or a normal form approach to compute mappings and
reduced dynamics. These developments are first recalled following a historical
perspective, where the main applications were first oriented toward structural
models that can be expressed thanks to partial differential equations (PDE).
They are then replaced in the more general context of the parametrisation of
invariant manifold that allows unifying the approaches. Then the specific case
of structures discretized with the finite element method is addressed. Implicit
condensation, giving rise to a projection onto a stress manifold, and modal
derivatives, used in the framework of the quadratic manifold, are first
reviewed. Finally, recent developments allowing direct computation of
reduced-order models (ROMs) relying on invariant manifolds theory are detailed.
Applicative examples are shown and the extension of the methods to deal with
further complications are reviewed. Finally, open problems and future
directions are highlighted.

thermal lens is utilized to simultaneously capture image pairs. Then, a mobile

proposed to realize face alignment and mask detection on the RGB images. For
accurate temperature measurement, we transform the facial landmarks on the RGB
images to the thermal images by an affine transformation and select a more
accurate temperature measurement area on the forehead. The collected

Experiments show that the detection model is only 6.1M and the average

(or D-semifaithful source coding) for stationary and memoryless sources on
countably infinite alphabets ($\infty$-alphabets) is addressed in this paper.
The main results of this work offer a set of sufficient conditions (from weaker
to stronger) to obtain weak minimax universality, strong minimax universality,
and corresponding achievable rates of convergences for the worse-case
redundancy for the family of stationary memoryless sources whose densities are
dominated by an envelope function (or the envelope family) on
$\infty$-alphabets. An important implication of these results is that universal
D-semifaithful source coding is not feasible for the complete family of
stationary and memoryless sources on $\infty$-alphabets. To demonstrate this
infeasibility, a sufficient condition for the impossibility is presented for
the envelope family. Interestingly, it matches the well-known impossibility
condition in the context of lossless (variable-length) universal source coding.
More generally, this work offers a simple description of what is needed to
achieve universal D-semifaithful coding for a family of distributions
$\Lambda$. This reduces to finding a collection of quantizations of the product
space at different block-lengths -- reflecting the fixed distortion restriction
-- that satisfy two asymptotic requirements: the first is a universal
quantization condition with respect to $\Lambda$, and the second is a vanishing
information radius (I-radius) condition for $\Lambda$ reminiscent of the
condition known for lossless universal source coding.

surveys thus have a key role to play, in particular for giant planets. Cold
Jupiters induce a typical radial velocity semi-amplitude of 10m.s^{-1}, which
is well within the reach of multiple instruments that have now been in
operation for more than a decade. Aims. We take advantage of the ongoing radial
velocity survey with the sophie high-resolution spectrograph, which continues
the search started by its predecessor elodie to further characterize the cold
Jupiter population. Methods. Analyzing the radial velocity data from six bright
solar-like stars taken over a period of up to 15 years, we attempt the
detection and confirmation of Keplerian signals. Results. We announce the
discovery of six planets, one per system, with minimum masses in the range
2.99-8.3 Mjup and orbital periods between 200 days and 10 years. The data do
not provide enough evidence to support the presence of additional planets in
any of these systems. The analysis of stellar activity indicators confirms the
planetary nature of the detected signals. Conclusions. These six planets belong
to the cold and massive Jupiter population, and four of them populate its
eccentric tail. In this respect, HD 80869 b stands out as having one of the
most eccentric orbits, with an eccentricity of 0.862^{+0.028}_{-0.018}. These
planets can thus help to better constrain the migration and evolution processes
at play in the gas giant population. Furthermore, recent works presenting the
correlation between small planets and cold Jupiters indicate that these systems
are good candidates to search for small inner planets.

In the late inspiral, we show that bulk viscosity affects the binding energy at
fourth post-Newtonian (PN) order. Even though this effect is enhanced by the
square of the gravitational compactness, the coefficient of bulk viscosity is
likely too small to lead to observable effects in the waveform during the late
inspiral, when only considering the orbital motion itself. In the post-merger,
however, the characteristic time-scales and spatial scales are different,
potentially leading to the opposite conclusion. We post-process data from a
state-of-the-art equal-mass binary neutron star merger simulation to estimate
the effects of bulk viscosity (which was not included in the simulation
itself). In that scenario, we find that bulk viscosity can reach high values in
regions of the merger. We compute several estimates of how much it might
directly affect the global dynamics of the considered merger scenario, and find
that it could become significant. Even larger effects could arise in different
merger scenarios or in simulations that include non-linear effects. This
assessment is reinforced by a quantitative comparison with relativistic
heavy-ion collisions where such effects have been explored extensively.

mimicking characteristics attributed to human intelligence, such as vision,
speech, and problem-solving. However, as previous technological revolutions
suggest, their most significant impacts could be mostly expected on other
sectors that were not traditional users of that technology. The agricultural
sector is vital for African economies; improving yields, mitigating losses, and
effective management of natural resources are crucial in a climate change era.
Machine Learning is a technology with an added value in making predictions,
hence the potential to reduce uncertainties and risk across sectors, in this
case, the agricultural sector. The purpose of this paper is to contextualize
and discuss barriers to ML-based solutions for African agriculture. In the
second section, we provided an overview of ML technology from a historical and
technical perspective and its main driving force. In the third section, we
provided a brief review of the current use of ML in agriculture. Finally, in

multiple Caputo fractional derivatives with order much smaller than 1. The key
is to exploit its extension problem by converting the flat singular kernels
into strongly localized ones, so that the major contribution of weakly singular
integrals over a semi-infinite interval can be captured by a few Laguerre
functions with proper asymptotic behavior. Despite its success in reducing both
memory requirement and arithmetic complexity, we show that numerical accuracy
under prescribed memory variables may deteriorate in time due to the dynamical
increments of projection errors. Fortunately, it can be considerably alleviated
by introducing a suitable scaling factor $\beta > 1$ and pushing the
collocation points closer to origin. An operator splitting scheme is introduced
to solve the resulting set of equations, where the auxiliary dynamics can be
solved exactly, so that it gets rid of the numerical stiffness and
discretization errors. Numerical experiments on both 1-D diffusive wave
equation and 2-D constant-Q $P$- and $S$-wave equations are presented to
validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed scheme.

during the COVID-19 pandemic, less attention has been given to the recent surge

Tablighi Jamaat gathering has driven people towards forming anti-Muslim
communities around hashtags like #coronajihad, #tablighijamaatvirus on Twitter.
In addition to the online spaces, the rise in Islamophobia has also resulted in
increased hate crimes in the real world. Hence, an investigation is required to
create interventions. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first
large-scale quantitative study linking Islamophobia with COVID-19.

hate spanning four months, with over 410,990 tweets from 244,229 unique users.
We use this dataset to perform longitudinal analysis. We find the relation
between the trend on Twitter with the offline events that happened over time,
measure the qualitative changes in the context associated with the Muslim
community, and perform macro and micro topic analysis to find prevalent topics.
We also explore the nature of the content, focusing on the toxicity of the URLs
shared within the tweets present in the CoronaBias dataset. Apart from the
content-based analysis, we focus on user analysis, revealing that the portrayal
of religion as a symbol of patriotism played a crucial role in deciding how the

paper, Butera, Pernici and the author have introduced a quantity $u(i)$, $u(i)
= -\ln(i!m\_i)$, a function of the number of $i$-matchings, $m\_i$, and
conjectured that the fraction of graphs that violate $\Delta^k u(i) > 0$ for $k
> 1$ vanishes as $n$ goes to infinity.
  Here $\Delta$ is the finite difference operator. We now more particularly
define the ""Virial Positivity Conjecture"" as the conjecture that the fraction
of graphs that satisfy $\Delta^k u(i)$ go to 0 for all $k > 1$ and $i$,
approaches 1 as $n$ goes to infinity. The ""Weak Virial Positivity Conjecture""
is the conjecture that for each $i$ and $k > 1$ the probability that $\Delta^k
u(i) > 0$ goes to $1$ as $n$ goes to infinity. The term Virial is used since
the condition $\Delta^k u(i) > 0$ corresponds to the positivity of the Virial
coefficients for infinite regular lattices.

$i+k < 101$, $1 < k < 28$,or $i+k < 30$ all $r$. A formalism of Wanless as
systematized by Pernici is central to this effort. Basically this paper is a
corollary to our parallel attack on graph positivity in a previous paper. We

qualitatively (visually) better than many of the state-of-the-art denoising

regular lattices to the more general setting of graphs and networks is very
important and much research has been done recently. The Generalized Haar-Walsh
Transform (GHWT) developed by Irion and Saito (2014) is a multiscale transform
for signals on graphs, which is a generalization of the classical Haar and
Walsh-Hadamard Transforms. We propose the extended Generalized Haar-Walsh

tilings of Thiele and Villemoes (1996). The eGHWT examines not only the
efficiency of graph-domain partitions but also that of ""sequency-domain""
partitions simultaneously. Consequently, the eGHWT and its associated
best-basis selection algorithm for graph signals significantly improve the
performance of the previous GHWT with the similar computational cost, $O(N \log
N)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes of an input graph. While the GHWT
best-basis algorithm seeks the most suitable orthonormal basis for a given task
among more than $(1.5)^N$ possible orthonormal bases in $\mathbb{R}^N$, the
eGHWT best-basis algorithm can find a better one by searching through more than
$0.618\cdot(1.84)^N$ possible orthonormal bases in $\mathbb{R}^N$. This article
describes the details of the eGHWT best-basis algorithm and demonstrates its
superiority using several examples including genuine graph signals as well as
conventional digital images viewed as graph signals. Furthermore, we also show
how the eGHWT can be extended to 2D signals and matrix-form data by viewing
them as a tensor product of graphs generated from their columns and rows and

observations plays a critical role for streaming vision systems that demand
real-time inference, as video actions often possess elongated temporal spans
which cause undesired latency. In this study, we address action prediction by
investigating how action patterns evolve over time in a spatial feature space.
There are three key components to our system. First, we work with
intermediate-layer ConvNet features, which allow for abstraction from raw data,
while retaining spatial layout. Second, instead of propagating features per se,
we propagate their residuals across time, which allows for a compact
representation that reduces redundancy. Third, we employ a Kalman filter to
combat error build-up and unify across prediction start times. Extensive
experimental results on multiple benchmarks show that our approach leads to
competitive performance in action prediction. Notably, we investigate the
learned components of our system to shed light on their otherwise opaque
natures in two ways. First, we document that our learned feature propagation
module works as a spatial shifting mechanism under convolution to propagate
current observations into the future. Thus, it captures flow-based image motion
information. Second, the learned Kalman filter adaptively updates prior
estimation to aid the sequence learning process.

has two major subdivisions: early action recognition and future action
prediction. Early action recognition is concerned with recognizing an ongoing
action as soon as possible. Future action prediction is concerned with the
anticipation of actions that follow those previously observed. In either case,
the \textbf{\textit{causal}} relationship between the past, current, and

as Markov Chains, Gaussian Processes, Auto-Regressive modeling, and Bayesian
recursive filtering are widely adopted jointly with computer vision techniques
for these two tasks. However, these approaches face challenges such as the
curse of dimensionality, poor generalization, and constraints from
domain-specific knowledge. Recently, structures that rely on deep convolutional
neural networks and recurrent neural networks have been extensively proposed
for improving the performance of existing vision tasks, in general, and action
prediction tasks, in particular. However, they have their own shortcomings, \eg
reliance on massive training data and lack of strong theoretical underpinnings.
In this survey, we start by introducing the major sub-areas of the broad area
of video predictive understanding, which recently have received intensive
attention and proven to have practical value. Next, a thorough review of
various early action recognition and future action prediction algorithms are

gravity-driven subduction of oceanic lithosphere on Earth, we study a simple
model of a thin and dense axisymmetric shell of thickness $h$ and viscosity
$\eta_1$ sinking in a spherical body of fluid with radius $R_0$ and a lower
viscosity $\eta_0$. Using scaling analysis based on thin viscous shell theory,
we identify a fundamental length scale, the `bending length' $l_b$, and two key
dimensionless parameters that control the dynamics: the `flexural stiffness'
$St = (\eta_1/\eta_0)(h/l_b)^3$ and the `sphericity number' $\Sigma=
(l_b/R_0)\cot\theta_t$, where $\theta_t$ is the angular radius of the
subduction trench. To validate the scaling analysis, we obtain a suite of
instantaneous numerical solutions using a boundary-element method based on new
analytical point-force Green functions that satisfy free-slip boundary
conditions on the sphere's surface. To isolate the effect of sphericity, we
calculate the radial sinking speed $V$ and the hoop stress resultant $T_2$ at
the leading end of the subducted part of the shell, both normalised by their
`flat-Earth' values (i.e., for $\Sigma = 0$). For reasonable terrestrial values
of $\eta_1/\eta_0$ ($\approx$ several hundred), sphericity has a modest effect
on $V$, which is reduced by $< 7\%$ for large plates such as the Pacific plate
and by up to 34% for smaller plates such as the Cocos and Philippine Sea
plates. However, sphericity has a much greater effect on $T_2$, increasing it
by up to 64% for large plates and 240% for small plates. This result has
important implications for the growth of longitudinal buckling instabilities in
subducting spherical shells.

is trained on the dataset generated by XFEM-based fracture simulator. Our
framework achieves high prediction accuracy on the test set (compared to an

the second prediction stage determines which microcracks will propagate, and
the final stage actually propagates crack-tip positions for the selected
microcracks to the next time instant. The trained GNN framework is capable of
simulating crack propagation, coalescence and corresponding stress distribution
for a wide range of initial microcrack configurations (from 5 to 19

regularized with convex penalty in linear models with Gaussian design matrix

constructed with the Huber loss and the Elastic-Net penalty and the noise
distribution has heavy-tails. Our main contributions are three-fold. (i) We
provide general formulae for the derivatives of regularized M-estimators
$\hat\beta(y,X)$ where differentiation is taken with respect to both $y$ and
$X$; this reveals a simple differentiability structure shared by all convex
regularized M-estimators. (ii) Using these derivatives, we characterize the

high-dimensional regime where dimension and sample size are of the same order.
(iii) Motivated by the distribution of the residuals, we propose a novel
adaptive criterion to select tuning parameters of regularized M-estimators. The
criterion approximates the out-of-sample error up to an additive constant
independent of the estimator, so that minimizing the criterion provides a proxy
for minimizing the out-of-sample error. The proposed adaptive criterion does
not require the knowledge of the noise distribution or of the covariance of the
design. Simulated data confirms the theoretical findings, regarding both the
distribution of the residuals and the success of the criterion as a proxy of
the out-of-sample error. Finally our results reveal new relationships between
the derivatives of $\hat\beta(y,X)$ and the effective degrees of freedom of the
M-estimator, which are of independent interest.

Moreover, the lifting of an affine bi-Lagrangian structure is also an affine

the set of bi-Lagrangian structures (that is an action of the symplectomorphism
group on the set of bi-Lagrangian structures). This dynamic is compatible with
Hess connections, preserves affine bi-Lagrangian structures, and can be lifted

object association. The proposed greedy algorithm uses the depth, velocity and
2D displacement of the detected objects to associate them through time. This
makes our tracking algorithm very robust to occluded and overlapping objects,

them. We evaluate our method on the challenging nuScenes dataset, where it

number of subsequences of length $n$ that have a Hamming weight $t$. To do so,
we first characterize the Hamming weight distribution of the average dual code
and use the MacWilliams identity to find the average Hamming weight
distribution of subsequences of $m$-sequences. We further find a lower bound on
the minimum Hamming weight of the subsequences and show that there always
exists a primitive polynomial to generate an $m$-sequence to meet this bound.
We show via simulations that when a proper primitive polynomial is chosen,
subsequences of the $m$-sequence can form a good rateless code that can meet
the normal approximation benchmark.

space. Multiple packing is a natural generalization of sphere packing and is
defined as follows. Let $ N>0 $ and $ L\in\mathbb{Z}_{\ge2} $. A multiple
packing is a set $\mathcal{C}$ of points in $ \mathbb{R}^n $ such that any
point in $ \mathbb{R}^n $ lies in the intersection of at most $ L-1 $ balls of
radius $ \sqrt{nN} $ around points in $ \mathcal{C} $. We study the multiple
packing problem for both bounded point sets whose points have norm at most
$\sqrt{nP}$ for some constant $P>0$ and unbounded point sets whose points are
allowed to be anywhere in $ \mathbb{R}^n $. Given a well-known connection with
coding theory, multiple packings can be viewed as the Euclidean analog of
list-decodable codes, which are well-studied for finite fields. In this paper,
we derive various bounds on the largest possible density of a multiple packing
in both bounded and unbounded settings. A related notion called average-radius
multiple packing is also studied. Some of our lower bounds exactly pin down the
asymptotics of certain ensembles of average-radius list-decodable codes, e.g.,
(expurgated) Gaussian codes and (expurgated) Poisson Point Processes. To this
end, we apply tools from high-dimensional geometry and large deviation theory.
Some of our lower bounds on the optimal multiple packing density are the best
known lower bounds. These bounds are obtained via a proxy known as error
exponent. The latter quantity is the best exponent of the probability of
list-decoding error when the code is corrupted by a Gaussian noise. We
establish a curious inequality which relates the error exponent, a quantity of
average-case nature, to the list-decoding radius, a quantity of worst-case
nature. We derive various bounds on the error exponent in both bounded and
unbounded settings which are of independent interest beyond multiple packing.

relaxations, most system operators around the world still predominantly use
some form of linear programming (LP) approximation of the AC power flow

computational efficiency, especially in real-time market applications,
security-constrained applications, and extensions involving integer variables,
in addition to its ability to readily generate locational marginal prices (LMP)
for market applications. In the aim of leveraging the advantages of LP while
retaining the accuracy of NLP interior-point methods (IPMs), this paper
proposes a sequential linear programming (SLP) approach consisting of a
sequence of carefully constructed supporting hyperplanes and halfspaces. The
algorithm is numerically demonstrated to converge on 138 test cases with up the
3375 buses to feasible high-quality solutions (i) without AC feasibility
restoration (i.e., using LP solvers exclusively), (ii) in computation times
generally within the same order of magnitude as those from a state-of-the-art
NLP solver, and (iii) with robustness against the choice of starting point. In
particular, the (relative) optimality gaps and the mean constraint violations
are on average around 1e-3% and 1e-7, respectively, under a single parameter
setting for all the 138 test cases. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed
SLP approach is the first to use LP exclusively to reach feasible and
high-quality solutions to the nonconvex AC OPF in a reliable way, which paves
the way for system and market operators to keep using their LP solvers but now
with the ability to accurately capture transmission losses, price reactive

quality. However, it is a burden for developers to understand the
poorly-commented tests, which are common in industry environment projects.
Mobile applications (app) are GUI-intensive and event-driven, so test scripts
focusing on GUI interactions play a more important role in mobile app testing
besides the test cases for the source code. Therefore, more attention should be
paid to the user interactions and the corresponding user event responses.
However, test scripts are loosely linked to apps under test (AUT) based on
widget selectors, making it hard to map the operations to the functionality
code of AUT. In such a situation, code understanding algorithms may lose
efficacy if directly applied to mobile app test scripts.
  We present a novel approach, TestIntent, to infer the intent of mobile app
test scripts. TestIntent combines the GUI image understanding and code
understanding technologies. The test script is transferred into an operation
sequence model. For each operation, TestIntent extracts the operated widget
selector and link the selector to the UI layout structure, which stores the
detailed information of the widgets, including coordinates, type, etc. With
code understanding technologies, TestIntent can locate response methods in the
source code. Afterwards, NLP algorithms are adopted to understand the code and
generate descriptions. Also, TestIntent can locate widgets on the app GUI
images. Then, TestIntent can understand the widget intent with an
encoder-decoder model. With the combination of the results from GUI and code
understanding, TestIntent generates the test intents in natural language
format. We also conduct an empirical experiment, and the results prove the
outstanding performance of TestIntent. A user study also declares that
TestIntent can save developers' time to understand test scripts.

sheet into a perfect cone when the sheet is of infinite extent and is
elastically inextensible. The latter requires the elastic stretching strains to
be vanishingly small. In this paper, rigorous analytical and numerical results
are obtained for the disclination induced deformed shape and stress field of a
bounded F{\""o}ppl-von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n elastic sheet with finite extensibility,
while emphasising the deviations from the perfect cone solution. In particular,
the Gaussian curvature field is no longer localised as a Dirac singularity at
the defect location whenever elastic extensibility is allowed and is
necessarily negative in large regions away from the defect. The stress field,
similarly, has no Dirac singularity in the presence of elastic extensibility.
However, with increasing Young's modulus of the sheet, while keeping the
bending modulus and the domain size fixed, both of these fields tend to develop
a Dirac singularity. Noticeably, in this limiting behaviour, inextensibility
eludes the bounded elastic sheet due to persisting regions of non-trivial
Gaussian curvature away from the defect. Other results in the paper include
studying the effect of specific boundary conditions (free, simply supported, or

acoustic shadow for acoustic charged black hole is larger than that for

increasing the black hole charge because their related outer horizons become
smaller. Then the QNM frequencies under scalar field perturbation and its
eikonal limit are computed via numeric method and acoustic shadow,
respectively. We find that the acoustic charged black hole is stable under the
perturbation and the QNM frequencies are much weaker than that for the
astrophysical black hole. Moreover, as the tuning parameter increases, the
perturbation oscillates more mildly and its damping time becomes longer, while
as the charge increases, the oscillation is enhanced slightly and the
perturbation decays a little faster which is different from that in RN black
hole. Finally, we numerically study the analogue Hawking radiation. We find
that the grey-body factor and energy emission rate are suppressed by the
angular number and the charge, but they do not monotonically depend on the
tuning parameter in the acoustic charged black hole. The behavior of the energy
emission rate affected by the parameters could be explained by the dependent

inevitable. In addition, DP largely depends on defect detection either found
earlier in the design and implementation stages or held in the testing phases.
However, testing maturity model integration (TMMI) has a crucial aspect in DP
as well as process improvement of the software. In particular, when software
gets validated by being tested and fixed the defects up, it achieves the
maximum capability maturity model integration (CMMI) aiming the process

this end, we present a low-complexity MAF-MAD scheduler, that employs Maximum
AoI First (MAF) policy for sampling of IoT devices at UAV (hop 1) and Maximum

of the electron from the potential dependent excited state to the ground state
causes the emission of photons with a specific energy. The energy of the
emitted photons can be controlled by appropriately tweaking the potential
parameters. The resonant enhancement in high-harmonic generation enables the
emission of very intense extreme ultra-violet or soft x-ray radiations. The
scaling law of the resonant harmonic emission with the model parameter of the

improved determination of the requisite Ioffe-time Pseudo-distribution (pITD).
The impact of higher-twist effects is subsequently explored by extending the
Wilson line length present in our non-local operators to one half the spatial
extent of the lattice ensemble considered. The valence PDF is extracted by
analyzing both the matched Ioffe-time Distribution (ITD), as well as a direct
matching of the pITD to the PDF. Through development of a novel prescription to
obtain the PDF from the pITD, we establish a concerning deviation of the pITD
from the expected DGLAP evolution of the pseudo-PDF. The presence of DGLAP
evolution is observed once more following introduction of a discretization term
into the PDF extractions. Observance and correction of this discrepancy further
highlights the utility of distillation in such structure studies.

the risk of a global minimum variance portfolio. The incremental analysis

through cosmic time is a probe of evolutionary pathways. Hydrodynamical
cosmological simulations show that at high redshifts density profiles of
early-type galaxies were on average steep ($\gamma \sim -3$). As redshift
approaches zero, gas-poor mergers progressively cause the total mass density
slope to approach the `isothermal' slope of $\gamma \sim -2$. Simulations
therefore predict steep density slopes at high redshifts, with little to no
evolution in density slopes below $z \sim 1$. Gravitational lensing results in
the same redshift range find the opposite, namely a significant trend of
shallow density slopes at high redshifts, becoming steeper as redshift
approaches zero. Gravitational lensing results indicate a different
evolutionary mechanism for early-type galaxies than dry merging, such as
continued gas accretion or off-axis mergers. At redshift zero, isothermal
solutions are obtained by both simulations and dynamical modelling. This work
applies the Jeans dynamical modelling technique to observations of galaxies at
intermediate redshifts ($0.29 < z < 0.55 $) in order to derive density slopes
to address the tension between observations and simulations. We combine
two-dimensional kinematic fields from MUSE data with Hubble Space Telescope
photometry. The density slopes of 90 early-type galaxies from the Frontier
Fields project are presented. The total sample has a median of ${\gamma = -2.11
\pm 0.03}$ (standard error), in agreement with dynamical modelling studies at
redshift zero. The lack of evolution in total density slopes in the past 4-6
Gyrs supports a dry merging model for early-type galaxy evolution.

proliferation with rate $\lambda$. Biologically-relevant initial conditions
lead to long-time travelling wave solutions that move with speed
$c=2\sqrt{\lambda D}$. Despite these attractive features, there are several
biological limitations of travelling wave solutions of the Fisher-KPP model.
First, these travelling wave solutions do not predict a well-defined invasion
front. Second, biologically-relevant initial conditions lead to travelling
waves that move with speed $c=2\sqrt{\lambda D} > 0$. This means that, for
biologically-relevant initial data, the Fisher-KPP model can not be used to
study invasion with $c \ne 2\sqrt{\lambda D}$, or retreating travelling waves
with $c < 0$. Here, we reformulate the Fisher-KPP model as a moving boundary
problem on $x < s(t)$, and we show that this reformulated model alleviates the
key limitations of the Fisher-KPP model. Travelling wave solutions of the
moving boundary problem predict a well-defined front, and can propagate with

understand tables. Its main task is to recognize the internal structure of a
table. However, due to the complexity and diversity in their structure and
style, it is very difficult to parse the tabular data into the structured
format which machines can understand easily, especially for complex tables. In
this paper, we introduce Split, Embed and Merge (SEM), an accurate table
structure recognizer. Our model takes table images as input and can correctly
recognize the structure of tables, whether they are simple or a complex tables.
SEM is mainly composed of three parts, splitter, embedder and merger. In the
first stage, we apply the splitter to predict the potential regions of the
table row (column) separators, and obtain the fine grid structure of the table.
In the second stage, by taking a full consideration of the textual information
in the table, we fuse the output features for each table grid from both vision
and language modalities. Moreover, we achieve a higher precision in our
experiments through adding additional semantic features. Finally, we process
the merging of these basic table grids in a self-regression manner. The
correspondent merging results is learned through the attention mechanism. In
our experiments, SEM achieves an average F1-Measure of 97.11% on the SciTSR
dataset which outperforms other methods by a large margin. We also won the
first place in the complex table and third place in all tables in ICDAR 2021

only optimize the overall reward but also satisfy the additional safety,
diversity, or budget constraints. Consequently, existing constrained RL
solutions require several new algorithmic ingredients that are notably
different from standard RL. On the other hand, reward-free RL is independently
developed in the unconstrained literature, which learns the transition dynamics
without using the reward information, and thus naturally capable of addressing
RL with multiple objectives under the common dynamics. This paper bridges
reward-free RL and constrained RL. Particularly, we propose a simple
meta-algorithm such that given any reward-free RL oracle, the approachability
and constrained RL problems can be directly solved with negligible overheads in
sample complexity. Utilizing the existing reward-free RL solvers, our framework
provides sharp sample complexity results for constrained RL in the tabular MDP
setting, matching the best existing results up to a factor of horizon
dependence; our framework directly extends to a setting of tabular two-player
Markov games, and gives a new result for constrained RL with linear function
approximation.

structure of continuous surveillance and discipline proposed by Bentham in
1785. This device was, later, used by Foucault and other philosophers as a
paradigm and metaphor for the study of constitutional power and knowledge as
well as a model of individuals' deprivation of freedom. Nowadays, technological
achievements have given rise to new, non-physical (unlike prisons), means of
constant surveillance that transcend physical boundaries. This, combined with
the confession of some governmental institutions that they actually collaborate
with these Internet giants to collect or deduce information about people,
creates a worrisome situation of several co-existing Panopticons that can act
separately or in close collaboration. Thus, they can only be detected and
identified through the expense of (perhaps considerable) effort. In this paper
we provide a theoretical framework for studying the detectability status of
Panopticons that fall under two theoretical, but not unrealistic, definitions.
We show, using Oracle Turing Machines, that detecting modern day, ICT-based,
Panopticons is an undecidable problem. Furthermore, we show that for each
sufficiently expressive formal system, we can effectively construct a Turing
Machine for which it is impossible to prove, within the formal system, either

Common envelope evolution is very important in stellar astrophysics,
particularly in the context of very compact and short-period binaries,

mergers of black holes and/or neutron stars. At the same time it is a barely
understood process in binary evolution. Due to limitations, since partially
remedied, on direct simulation, early investigations were mainly focused on
providing analytic prescriptions of the outcome of common envelope evolution.
In recent years, detailed hydrodynamical calculations have produced deeper
insight into the previously elusive process of envelope ejection. However, a
direct link between observations and theory of this relatively short-lived
phase in binary evolution has not been forthcoming. Therefore, the main insight
to be gained from observations has to be derived from the current state of
systems likely to have gone through a common envelope. Here we present an
extensive catalogue of such observations as found in the literature. The aim of
this paper is to provide a reliable set of data, obtained from observations, to
be used in the theoretical modelling of common envelope evolution. In this
catalogue, the former common envelope donor star is commonly observed as a
white dwarf star or as a hot sub-dwarf star. This catalogue includes period and

relational hyper-safety violations, comparing pairs of program executions,

only over individual executions. Existing symbolic leakage detection methods
treat only non-interactive programs, avoiding the challenges of nondeterminism.
Also, being whole-program analyses they cannot be applied

these shortcomings by presenting Insecurity Separation Logic (InsecSL), an
under-approximate relational program logic for soundly detecting information
leakage and memory-safety issues in interactive programs. Importantly, InsecSL
reasons about pairs of executions, and so is relational, but purposefully
resembles the non-relational Incorrectness Separation Logic (ISL) that is
already automated in the Infer tool. We show how InsecSL can be automated by
bi-abduction based symbolic execution, and we evaluate two implementations of

transport equations with discontinuous boundary conditions, parameterized by a
positive real-valued parameter $\lambda$, is considered. These equations
describe the hydrodynamic or fluid limit of many-server queues with reneging
(with traffic intensity $\lambda$), which model phenomena in diverse
disciplines, including biology and operations research. For a broad class of
reneging distributions with finite mean and service distributions with finite
mean and hazard rate function that is either decreasing or bounded away from
zero and infinity, it is shown that if the fluid equations have a unique
invariant state, then the Dirac measure at this state is the unique random
fixed point of the fluid equations, which implies that the stationary
distributions of scaled $N$-server systems converge to the unique invariant
state of the corresponding fluid equations. Moreover, when $\lambda\ne 1$, it
is shown that the solution to the fluid equation starting from any initial
condition converges to this unique invariant state in the large time limit. The
proof techniques are different under the two sets of assumptions on the service
distribution. When the hazard rate function is decreasing, a reformulation of
the dynamics in terms of a certain renewal equation is used, in conjunction
with recursive asymptotic estimates. When the hazard rate function is bounded
away from zero and infinity, the proof uses an extended relative entropy
functional as a Lyapunov function. Analogous large-time convergence results are
also established for a system of coupled measure-valued equations modeling a

utilize the recurrent neural network architecture or self-attention to model
the sequential patterns and temporal influence among a user's historical
behavior and learn the user's preference at a specific time. However, these
methods have two main drawbacks. First, they focus on modeling users' dynamic
states from a user-centric perspective and always neglect the dynamics of items
over time. Second, most of them deal with only the first-order user-item
interactions and do not consider the high-order connectivity between users and
items, which has recently been proved helpful for the sequential
recommendation. To address the above problems, in this article, we attempt to
model user-item interactions by a bipartite graph structure and propose a new
recommendation approach based on a Position-enhanced and Time-aware Graph
Convolutional Network (PTGCN) for the sequential recommendation. PTGCN models
the sequential patterns and temporal dynamics between user-item interactions by
defining a position-enhanced and time-aware graph convolution operation and
learning the dynamic representations of users and items simultaneously on the
bipartite graph with a self-attention aggregator. Also, it realizes the
high-order connectivity between users and items by stacking multi-layer graph
convolutions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of PTGCN, we carried out a
comprehensive evaluation of PTGCN on three real-world datasets of different
sizes compared with a few competitive baselines. Experimental results indicate
that PTGCN outperforms several state-of-the-art models in terms of two
commonly-used evaluation metrics for ranking.

straight and without bends, at three to six times higher growth rates than
commissurals, indicating they project their path on a substrate-bound surface

found the evidence of an inclination dependence of the maximal fractional rms

predicted in early magnetohydrodynamic simulations of isothermal disks limited

for massive access, its potential has not been fully unleashed. In particular,
the common sparsity pattern in the received pilot and data signal has been
ignored in most existing studies, and auxiliary information of channel decoding
has not been utilized for user activity detection. This paper endeavors to
develop advanced receivers in a holistic manner for joint activity detection,
channel estimation, and data decoding. In particular, a turbo receiver based on
the bilinear generalized approximate message passing (BiG-AMP) algorithm is
developed. In this receiver, all the received symbols will be utilized to
jointly estimate the channel state, user activity, and soft data symbols, which
effectively exploits the common sparsity pattern. Meanwhile, the extrinsic
information from the channel decoder will assist the joint channel estimation
and data detection. To reduce the complexity, a low-cost side information-aided
receiver is also proposed, where the channel decoder provides side information
to update the estimates on whether a user is active or not. Simulation results
show that the turbo receiver is able to reduce the activity detection, channel
estimation, and data decoding errors effectively, while the side
information-aided receiver notably outperforms the conventional method with a

research topics in recommender systems. Among existing methods, latent factor
models, i.e., learning a specific embedding for each user/item by
reconstructing the observed interaction matrix, have shown excellent
performances. However, such user-specific and item-specific embeddings are
intrinsically transductive, making it difficult to deal with new users and new
items unseen during training. Besides, the number of model parameters heavily
depends on the number of all users and items, restricting its scalability to
real-world applications. To solve the above challenges, in this paper, we
propose a novel model-agnostic and scalable Inductive Embedding Module for
collaborative filtering, namely INMO. INMO generates the inductive embeddings
for users (items) by characterizing their interactions with some template items
(template users), instead of employing an embedding lookup table. Under the
theoretical analysis, we further propose an effective indicator for the
selection of template users/items. Our proposed INMO can be attached to
existing latent factor models as a pre-module, inheriting the expressiveness of
backbone models, while bringing the inductive ability and reducing model
parameters. We validate the generality of INMO by attaching it to both Matrix
Factorization (MF) and LightGCN, which are two representative latent factor
models for collaborative filtering. Extensive experiments on three public
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of INMO in both
transductive and inductive recommendation scenarios.

power of the T-C quantum battery are closely related to the probability
distribution of the optical field initial state in the number states. We define
a quantity called the number-state stored energy. With this prescribed

photon number is large enough. We found two phenomena, which can be described

morphologies as well as controllers, the main research question is twofold: (i)
what is the impact on the morphologies of the evolved robots, and (ii) what is
the impact on the behavior of the evolved robots if energy consumption is
included in the fitness evaluation? The results show that including the energy

security against curious data owners; 2) data security against the curious
model and data owners; 3) resilience to malicious data owners who provide
faulty results to poison model training; and 4) resilience to malicious model
owners who intend to evade payment. OmniLytics is implemented as a blockchain
smart contract to guarantee the atomicity of payment. In OmniLytics, a model
owner splits its model into the private and public parts and publishes the
public part on the contract. Through the execution of the contract, the
participating data owners securely aggregate their locally trained models to
update the model owner's public model and receive reimbursement through the
contract. We implement a working prototype of OmniLytics on Ethereum blockchain

anatomical landmarks on the image for accurate biometry and fetal weight
estimation. This can be a time-consuming operator-dependent task, especially
for a trainee sonographer. Computer-assisted techniques can help in automating
the fetal biometry computation process. In this paper, we present a unified
automated framework for estimating all measurements needed for the fetal weight

anatomies using state-of-the-art segmentation models, followed by region
fitting and scale recovery for the biometry estimation. We present an ablation

cross-validation on a dataset of 349 ultrasound standard plane images from 42

performance tends to be more accurate for biometry estimation. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that the error between clinically measured and predicted fetal

for bandwidth, the wireless medium has become a congested and contested
environment. Operating under such an environment brings several challenges,
especially for military communication systems, which need to guarantee reliable
communication while avoiding interfering with other friendly or neutral systems
and denying the enemy systems of service. In this work, we investigate a novel
application of Rate-Splitting Multiple Access(RSMA) for joint communications
and jamming with a Multi-Carrier(MC) waveform in a multiantenna Cognitive
Radio(CR) system. RSMA is a robust multiple access scheme for downlink
multi-antenna wireless networks. RSMA relies on multi-antenna Rate-Splitting
(RS) at the transmitter and Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) at the
receivers. Our aim is to simultaneously communicate with Secondary Users(SUs)
and jam Adversarial Users(AUs) to disrupt their communications while limiting
the interference to Primary Users(PUs) in a setting where all users perform
broadband communications by MC waveforms in their respective networks. We
consider the practical setting of imperfect CSI at transmitter(CSIT) for the
SUs and PUs, and statistical CSIT for AUs. We formulate a problem to obtain
optimal precoders which maximize the mutual information under interference and
jamming power constraints. We propose an Alternating Optimization-Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers(AOADMM) based algorithm for solving the
resulting non-convex problem. We perform an analysis based on
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions to determine the optimal jamming and interference
power thresholds that guarantee the feasibility of problem and propose a
practical algorithm to calculate the interference power threshold. By
simulations, we show that RSMA achieves a higher sum-rate than Space Division

collapse causes quantum particle creation and the spectrum of the particles is
almost thermal. This phenomenon is called the Hawking radiation. Recently, it
has been predicted that the particle creation may drastically change from the
Hawking radiation to a strong double burst if the gravitational collapse
suddenly stops just before the formation of the event horizon. By contrast with
the Hawking radiation, the burst may be so strong that it can be of
observational interest even for collapsing objects with astrophysical mass
scales. However, the burst phenomenon has been predicted through the studies of
idealized models in which a spherical hollow shell begins to collapse, but
stops shrinking and eventually settles down to a static ""star"". Therefore, one
might guess that it could be particular to the hollow shell model. In this
paper, we study the particle creation due to the gravitational collapse of a
spherical object whose interior is filled with matter. In this model, we obtain
similar results to those in the case of the hollow shell model. This implies
that the double burst is a robust property of particle creation by the sudden
braking of gravitational collapse.

systems sparked a new interest in the study of proto-planetary discs in stellar
aggregations. Here we focus on disc solids, as they make up the reservoir out
of which exoplanets are assembled and dominate (sub-)millimetre disc
observations. These observations suggest that discs in binary systems are
fainter and smaller than in isolated systems. In addition, disc dust sizes are
consistent with tidal truncation only if they orbit very eccentric binaries. In
a previous study we showed that the presence of a stellar companion hastens the
radial migration of solids, shortening disc lifetime and challenging planet
formation. In this paper we confront our theoretical and numerical results with
observations: disc dust fluxes and sizes from our models are computed at ALMA
wavelengths and compared with Taurus and $\rho$ Ophiuchus data. A general
agreement between theory and observations is found. In particular, we show that
the dust disc sizes are generally smaller than the binary truncation radius due
to the combined effect of grain growth and radial drift: therefore, small disc
sizes do not require implausibly high eccentricities to be explained.
Furthermore, the observed binary discs are compatible within $1\sigma$ with a
quadratic flux-radius correlation similar to that found for single-star discs
and show a close match with the models. However, the observational sample of
resolved binary discs is still small and additional data are required to draw
more robust conclusions on the flux-radius correlation and how it depends on
the binary properties.

it contributes to the development of numerous types of tumors, and the
formation of metastases. Hence, demonstrating neoangiogenesis by visualization
of the microvasculature may be of great importance. Super resolution ultrasound
localization microscopy enables imaging of the microvasculature at the
capillary level. Yet, challenges such as long reconstruction time, dependency
on prior knowledge of the system Point Spread Function (PSF), and separability
of the Ultrasound Contrast Agents (UCAs), need to be addressed for translation
of super-resolution US into the clinic. In this work we use a deep neural

for randomly aggregating the constraints or variables of optimization problems
while approximately preserving their optimal values, that leads to
smaller-scale optimization problems. D'Ambrosio et al. have applied random
projection to a quadratic optimization problem so as to decrease the number of
decision variables. Although the problem size becomes smaller, the projected
problem will also almost surely be non-convex if the original problem is
non-convex, and hence will be hard to solve. In this paper, by focusing on the
fact that the level of the non-convexity of a non-convex quadratic optimization
problem can be alleviated by random projection, we find an approximate global
optimal value of the problem by attributing it to a convex problem with smaller
size. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to use random
projection for convexification of non-convex optimization problems. We evaluate
the approximation error between optimum values of a non-convex optimization
problem and its convexified randomly projected problem.

  Medical Image Segmentation",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurate segmentation of organs or lesions from medical images is crucial for
reliable diagnosis of diseases and organ morphometry. In recent years,
convolutional encoder-decoder solutions have achieved substantial progress in
the field of automatic medical image segmentation. Due to the inherent bias in
the convolution operations, prior models mainly focus on local visual cues
formed by the neighboring pixels, but fail to fully model the long-range
contextual dependencies. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer-based
Attention Guided Network called TransAttUnet, in which the multi-level guided
attention and multi-scale skip connection are designed to jointly enhance the
performance of the semantical segmentation architecture. Inspired by
Transformer, the self-aware attention (SAA) module with Transformer Self
Attention (TSA) and Global Spatial Attention (GSA) is incorporated into
TransAttUnet to effectively learn the non-local interactions among encoder
features. Moreover, we also use additional multi-scale skip connections between
decoder blocks to aggregate the upsampled features with different semantic
scales. In this way, the representation ability of multi-scale context
information is strengthened to generate discriminative features. Benefitting
from these complementary components, the proposed TransAttUnet can effectively
alleviate the loss of fine details caused by the stacking of convolution layers
and the consecutive sampling operations, finally improving the segmentation
quality of medical images. Extensive experiments on multiple medical image
segmentation datasets from different imaging modalities demonstrate that the
proposed method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines. Our
code and pre-trained models are available at:

each remote sensing image are regarded as geographical knowledge to provide
supervision for representation learning and network pre-training. An efficient
pre-training framework is proposed to eliminate the supervision noises caused
by imaging times and resolutions difference between remote sensing images and
geographical knowledge. A large scale pre-training dataset Levir-KR is proposed
to support network pre-training. It contains 1,431,950 remote sensing images
from Gaofen series satellites with various resolutions. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms ImageNet pre-training and
self-supervised representation learning methods and significantly reduces the

  Intelligent Vehicle Symposium Workshops (IV workshop)",,,,"cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The safety assessment of automated vehicles (AVs) is an important aspect of
the development cycle of AVs. A scenario-based assessment approach is accepted
by many players in the field as part of the complete safety assessment. A
scenario is a representation of a situation on the road to which the AV needs
to respond appropriately. One way to generate the required scenario-based test
descriptions is to parameterize the scenarios and to draw these parameters from
a probability density function (pdf). Because the shape of the pdf is unknown
beforehand, assuming a functional form of the pdf and fitting the parameters to
the data may lead to inaccurate fits. As an alternative, Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) is a promising candidate for estimating the underlying pdf,
because it is flexible with the underlying distribution of the parameters.
Drawing random samples from a pdf estimated with KDE is possible without the
need of evaluating the actual pdf, which makes it suitable for drawing random
samples for, e.g., Monte Carlo methods. Sampling from a KDE while the samples
satisfy a linear equality constraint, however, has not been described in the
literature, as far as the authors know.
  In this paper, we propose a method to sample from a pdf estimated using KDE,
such that the samples satisfy a linear equality constraint. We also present an
algorithm of our method in pseudo-code. The method can be used to generating
scenarios that have, e.g., a predetermined starting speed or to generate
different types of scenarios. This paper also shows that the method for
sampling scenarios can be used in case a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is
used to reduce the dimension of the parameter vectors.

at all the substrate temperatures employed in this study (221-341 C),

we show that observed memory effects can be accounted for by the non-uniform

consequence of these memory effects, the friction force may no longer be
aligned with respect to the sliding trajectory. In addition, stick-slip motions
with a purely geometrical origin are also evidenced. These observations are
adequately accounted for by a friction model which takes into account
heterogeneous displacements within the contact area. When a velocity dependence
of the frictional stress is incorporated in this the model, transient regimes
induced by velocity steps are also adequately described. The good agreement
between the model and experiments outlines the role of space heterogeneities in
memory effects involved in soft matter friction.

filament-like structures are mathematically just 1D curves embedded in R^3, and
integration-based reconstruction works best when depth sequences (from the thin
structure parts) are fused using the object's (unknown) curve skeleton. Thus,
using the complementary but noisy color and depth channels, CurveFusion first
automatically identifies point samples on potential thin structures and groups
them into bundles, each being a group of a fixed number of aligned consecutive
frames. Then, the algorithm extracts per-bundle skeleton curves using L1 axes,
and aligns and iteratively merges the L1 segments from all the bundles to form
the final complete curve skeleton. Thus, unlike previous methods,
reconstruction happens via integration along a data-dependent fusion primitive,
i.e., the extracted curve skeleton. We extensively evaluate CurveFusion on a
range of challenging examples, different scanner and calibration settings, and
present high fidelity thin structure reconstructions previously just not

Sixteen of the latter category reside in high-mass X-ray binaries, of which
only two systems were radio-detected previously. We detect four weakly and nine
strongly-magnetised NSs; the latter are systematically radio fainter than the
former and do not exceed $L_R \approx 3\times10^{28}$ erg/s. In turn, we
confirm the earlier finding that the weakly-magnetized NSs are typically radio
fainter than accreting stellar-mass black holes. While an unambiguous
identification of the origin of radio emission in high-mass X-ray binaries is
challenging, we find that in all but two detected sources (Vela X-1 and 4U

in CTMAB, since the optimal sampling frequency depends on the mean of the arm,
which needs to be estimated. We first establish lower bounds on the regret

lower bound up to logarithmic factors. For the single-arm case, we show that
the lower bound on the regret is $\Omega((\log T)^2/\mu)$, where $\mu$ is the

solve the semi-dual formulation of such a regularized and semi-discrete optimal

We establish the almost sure convergence and the asymptotic normality of
various estimators of interest that are constructed from this stochastic
Gauss-Newton algorithm. We also analyze their non-asymptotic rates of
convergence for the expected quadratic risk in the absence of strong convexity
of the underlying objective function. The results of numerical experiments from

full decay distribution with currently available data sets and investigate the
sensitivity to new physics scenarios given the experimental precision that is
expected in the future. The symmetry relations provide a unique handle to
explore the behaviour of S-wave observables by expressing them in terms of
P-wave observables, therefore minimising the dependence on poorly-known S-wave
form factors. Using this approach, we construct two theoretically clean S-wave
observables and explore their sensitivity to new physics. By further exploiting
the symmetry relations, we obtain the first bounds on the S-wave observables
using two different methods and highlight how these relations may be used as
cross-checks of the experimental methodology. We identify a zero-crossing point

potentially enable latency-critical applications to be provided through
satellites. NGSO promises a substantial boost in communication speed and energy

GSO satellites for broader utilization. The promised improvements of NGSO
systems have motivated this paper to provide a comprehensive survey of the
state-of-the-art NGSO research focusing on the communication prospects,
including physical layer and radio access technologies along with the
networking aspects and the overall system features and architectures. Beyond
this, there are still many NGSO deployment challenges to be addressed to ensure
seamless integration not only with GSO systems but also with terrestrial

are found in a vast majority of galaxies of intermediate stellar mass $10^{9}$
M$_{\odot}$. Recent investigations suggest that they are rarely found in the
least and most massive galaxies and that the nucleation fraction increases in
dense environments. It is unclear whether this trend holds true for field
galaxies due to the limited data currently available. Here we present our
results on the nucleation fraction for 601 galaxies in the Local Volume
($\lesssim 12$ Mpc). Covering more than eight orders of magnitude in stellar
mass, this is the largest sample of galaxies analysed in a low-density
environment. Within the Local Volume sample we find a strong dependence of the
nucleation fraction on galaxy stellar mass, in agreement with previous work. We
also find that for galaxies with $M_{\star} < 10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$, early-type
galaxies have a higher nucleation fraction than late-types. The nucleation
fraction in the Local Volume correlates independently with stellar mass, Hubble
type, and local environmental density. We compare our data to those in galaxy
cluster environments (Coma, Fornax, and Virgo) by compiling previous results
and calculating stellar masses in a homogeneous way. We find significantly
lower nucleation fractions (up to 40$\%$) in galaxies with $M_{\star} \lesssim
10^{9.5}$ M$_{\odot}$, in agreement with previous work. Our results reinforce
the connection between globular clusters and NSCs, but it remains unclear if it
can explain the observed trends with Hubble type and local environment. We
speculate that correlation between the nucleation fraction and cluster
environment weakens for the densest clusters like Coma and Virgo.

recommender systems. Without any historical interaction on cold-start items, CF
scheme fails to use collaborative signals to infer user preference on these
items. To solve this problem, extensive studies have been conducted to
incorporate side information into the CF scheme. Specifically, they employ
modern neural network techniques (e.g., dropout, consistency constraint) to
discover and exploit the coalition effect of content features and collaborative
representations. However, we argue that these works less explore the mutual
dependencies between content features and collaborative representations and
lack sufficient theoretical supports, thus resulting in unsatisfactory
performance. In this work, we reformulate the cold-start item representation
learning from an information-theoretic standpoint. It aims to maximize the
mutual dependencies between item content and collaborative signals.
Specifically, the representation learning is theoretically lower-bounded by the
integration of two terms: mutual information between collaborative embeddings
of users and items, and mutual information between collaborative embeddings and
feature representations of items. To model such a learning process, we devise a
new objective function founded upon contrastive learning and develop a simple
yet effective Contrastive Learning-based Cold-start Recommendation
framework(CLCRec). In particular, CLCRec consists of three components:
contrastive pair organization, contrastive embedding, and contrastive
optimization modules. It allows us to preserve collaborative signals in the
content representations for both warm and cold-start items. Through extensive
experiments on four publicly accessible datasets, we observe that CLCRec
achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in both
warm- and cold-start scenarios.

backreaction. We demonstrate how this formalism allows one to modify existing
slow-roll (SR) formulae to be fully valid outside of the SR regime. We then
compute the mass fraction, $\beta$, of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) formed by
a plateau in the inflationary potential. By fully accounting for the inflaton
velocity as it enters the plateau, we find that PBHs are generically
overproduced before the inflaton's velocity reaches zero, ruling out a period
of free diffusion or even stochastic noise domination on the inflaton dynamics.
We also examine a local inflection point and similarly conclude that PBHs are
overproduced before entering a quantum diffusion dominated regime. We therefore
surmise that the evolution of the inflaton is always predominantly classical
with diffusion effects always subdominant. Both the plateau and the inflection
point are characterized by a very sharp transition between the under- and
over-production regimes. This can be seen either as severe fine-tunning on the
inflationary production of PBHs, or as a very strong link between the fraction
$\beta$ and the shape of the potential and the plateau's extent.

reinforcement learning in R3L, we train a recurrent neural network with the

analyze how the two different training strategies affect the denoising

for shortest paths on the fee graph. We enhance this approach in two
dimensions. Firstly, we take into account the probability of a payment actually
being possible due to the unknown balance distributions in the channels.
Secondly, we use minimum cost flows as a proper generalization of shortest
paths to multi-part payments (MPP). In particular we show that under plausible
assumptions about the balance distributions we can find the most likely MPP for
any given set of senders, recipients and amounts by solving for a (generalized)
integer minimum cost flow with a separable and convex cost function. Polynomial
time exact algorithms as well as approximations are known for this optimization
problem. We present a round-based algorithm of min-cost flow computations for
delivering large payment amounts over the Lightning Network. This algorithm
works by updating the probability distributions with the information gained
from both successful and unsuccessful paths on prior rounds. In all our
experiments a single digit number of rounds sufficed to deliver payments of
sizes that were close to the total local balance of the sender. Early
experiments indicate that our approach increases the size of payments that can
be reliably delivered by several orders of magnitude compared to the current
state of the art. We observe that finding the cheapest multi-part payments is
an NP-hard problem considering the current fee structure and propose dropping
the base fee to make it a linear min-cost flow problem. Finally, we discuss
possibilities for maximizing the probability while at the same time minimizing
the fees of a flow. While this turns out to be a hard problem in general as
well - even in the single path case - it appears to be surprisingly tractable

that the system can exhibit three steady states for some parameters (termed the

show that for some parameter combinations the system is unstable to both upper

instabilities eventually merge together for large enough Reynolds numbers,
exhibiting a nonlinear limit cycle which retains characteristics of both the
upper and lower branches of oscillations. Furthermore, we show that increasing

preserves the onset of oscillations. Conversely, increasing the beam thickness

train a global model without obtaining clients' private data. The main
challenges in FL are statistical diversity among clients, limited computing
capability among clients' equipments, and the excessive communication overhead
between the server and clients. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
sparse personalized federated learning scheme via maximizing correlation
(FedMac). By incorporating an approximated L1-norm and the correlation between
client models and global model into standard FL loss function, the performance
on statistical diversity data is improved and the communicational and
computational loads required in the network are reduced compared with
non-sparse FL. Convergence analysis shows that the sparse constraints in FedMac
do not affect the convergence rate of the global model, and theoretical results
show that FedMac can achieve good sparse personalization, which is better than
the personalized methods based on L2-norm. Experimentally, we demonstrate the
benefits of this sparse personalization architecture compared with the
state-of-the-art personalization methods (e.g. FedMac respectively achieves
98.95%, 99.37%, 90.90%, 89.06% and 73.52% accuracy on the MNIST, FMNIST,

process in a randomly switched environment. That is, the infection and cure
rates of the process depend on the state of a finite Markov jump process (the
environment), whose transitions also depend on the number of infectives. The
total size of the population is constant and equal to some K $\in$ N * , and
the number of infectives vanishes almost surely in finite time. We prove that,
as K $\rightarrow$ $\infty$, the process composed of the proportions of
infectives of each type X^K and the state of the environment $\Xi$^K ,
converges to a piecewise deterministic Markov process (PDMP) given by a system
of randomly switched ODEs. The long term behaviour of this PDMP has been
previously investigated by Bena{\""i}m and Strickler, and depends only on the
sign of the top Lyapunov exponent $\Lambda$ of the linearised PDMP at 0: if
$\Lambda$ < 0, the proportion of infectives in each group converges to zero,
while if $\Lambda$ > 0, the disease becomes endemic. In this paper, we show
that the large population asymptotics of X^K also strongly depend on the sign
of $\Lambda$: if negative, then from fixed initial proportions of infectives
the disease disappears in a time of order at most log(K), while if positive,
the typical extinction time grows at least as a power of K. We prove that in
the situation where the origin is accessible for the linearised PDMP, the mean
extinction time of X^K is logarithmically equivalent to K^p * , where p * > 0
is fully characterised. We also investigate the quasi-stationary distribution
$\mu$^K of (X^K , $\Xi$^K) and show that, when $\Lambda$ < 0, weak limit points

self-energy of the test fields which fixes the overspinning problem for fields
with relatively large amplitudes, and renders it non-generic for smaller
amplitudes. This non-generic overspinning appears likely to be fixed by
alternative semi-classical and quantum effects.

Yang-Mills sector of QCD, i.e., QCD without quarks. In Landau gauge QCD this
mass gap, and hence confinement, is encoded in a mass gap of the gluon
propagator, which is found both in lattice simulations and with functional
approaches. While functional methods are well suited to unravel the mechanism
behind the generation of the mass gap, a fully satisfactory answer has not yet
been found. In this work we solve the coupled Dyson-Schwinger equations for the
ghost propagator, gluon propagator and three-gluon vertex. We corroborate the
findings of earlier works, namely that the mass gap generation is tied to the
longitudinal projection of the gluon self-energy, which acts as an effective
mass term in the equations. Because an explicit mass term is in conflict with
gauge invariance, this leaves two possible scenarios: If it is viewed as an
artifact, only the scaling solution survives; if it is dynamical, gauge
invariance can only be preserved if there are longitudinal massless poles in
either of the vertices. We find that there is indeed a massless pole in the
ghost-gluon vertex, however in our approximation with the assumption of
complete infrared dominance of the ghost this pole is only present for the
scaling solution. We also put forward a possible mechanism that may reconcile
the scaling solution, with an infrared dominance of the ghost, with the
decoupling solutions based on longitudinal poles in the three-gluon vertex as
seen in the PT-BFM scheme.

the GW spectrum at wave numbers away from the peak becomes smaller for larger

approaches zero at frequencies below the peak, and reaches its maximum at the

better when the datasets are split by timestamp or by project. Based on our

multi-label classification tasks, i.e., some policies may have negative impacts
on some labels while benefitting the others. To tackle this problem, we propose
a novel Label-Based AutoAugmentation (LB-Aug) method for multi-label scenarios,
where augmentation policies are generated with respect to labels by an
augmentation-policy network. The policies are learned via reinforcement
learning using policy gradient methods, providing a mapping from instance
labels to their optimal augmentation policies. Numerical experiments show that
our LB-Aug outperforms previous state-of-the-art augmentation methods by large
margins in multiple benchmarks on image and video classification.

large-scale synthetic datasets and effective transfer methods. We address this

contains point-wise annotated point clouds with accurate geometric shapes and
comprehensive semantic classes. SynLiDAR was collected from multiple virtual
environments with rich scenes and layouts which consists of over 19 billion
points of 32 semantic classes. In addition, we design PCT, a novel point cloud
translator that effectively mitigates the gap between synthetic and real point
clouds. Specifically, we decompose the synthetic-to-real gap into an appearance
component and a sparsity component and handle them separately which improves
the point cloud translation greatly. We conducted extensive experiments over
three transfer learning setups including data augmentation, semi-supervised
domain adaptation and unsupervised domain adaptation. Extensive experiments
show that SynLiDAR provides a high-quality data source for studying 3D transfer
and the proposed PCT achieves superior point cloud translation consistently

that will someday lead to fault tolerant quantum computers. The randomized
benchmarking (RB) protocol is designed with this exact mindset, estimating the
average strength of noise in a quantum processor with relative ease in
practice. However, RB, along with most other benchmarking and characterization
methods, is limited in scope because it assumes that the noise is temporally
uncorrelated (Markovian), which is increasingly evident not to be the case.
Here, we combine the RB protocol with a recent framework describing
non-Markovian quantum phenomena to derive a general analytical expression of
the average sequence fidelity (ASF) for non-Markovian RB with the Clifford
group. We show that one can identify non-Markovian features of the noise
directly from the ASF through its deviations from the Markovian case, proposing
a set of methods to collectively estimate these deviations, non-Markovian
memory time-scales, and diagnose (in)coherence of non-Markovian noise in an RB

several proof-of-principle examples. Our methods are directly implementable and
pave the pathway to better understanding correlated noise in quantum

efficiency and robustness important to ensure. However, these systems are
susceptible to disruptions and delays, leading to accumulating economic damage.
The large spatial scale of delay spreading typically make it difficult to
distinguish which regions will ultimately affected from an initial disruption,
creating uncertainty for risk assessment. In this paper, we identify
geographical structures that reflect how delay spreads through railway
networks. We do so by proposing a graph-based, hybrid schedule and
empirical-based model for delay propagation and apply spectral clustering. We
apply the model to four European railway systems: the Netherlands, Germany,
Switzerland and Italy. We characterize geographical structures in the railway
systems of these countries and interpret these regions in terms of delay
severity and how dynamically disconnected they are from the rest. The method
also allows us to point out important differences between these countries'
railway systems. For practitioners, this geographical characterization of
railways provide natural boundaries for local decision-making structures and a
first-order prioritization on which regions are at risk, given an initial

Majorana bound states confined at the ends of a topological superconducting

tunable magnetic flux, which allows one to control the electron transport in
the system. In particular, we investigate phonon-assisted transport properties
in the device when the central quantum dot interacts with a single long-wave
optical phonon mode. We find that when the two Majorana bound states are
unhybridized, the zero-temperature linear conductance has a $2\pi$ periodicity
as a function of magnetic flux phase, independent of the electron-phonon
interaction, the quantum dot energy, or the finite values of dot-Majorana
couplings. For a finite overlap between the Majorana bound states, the linear
conductance periodicity generally changes to $4\pi$ either due to a finite
electron-phonon coupling strength, or a dot energy level that is tuned away
from the Fermi level. Additionally, the differential conductance periodicity
changes from $2\pi$ to $4\pi$ when the Majorana bound states hybridize and the
electron-phonon coupling is finite. Our results provide insight into transport
signatures expected in topological quantum computational platforms that
integrate quantum dots as a means for Majorana qubit readout. The energy
exchange with an environmental bath, here a single phonon mode, significantly

Instead of focusing on equivalence of observations, like the $L^{\ast}$
algorithm and its descendants, $L^{\#}$ takes a different perspective: it tries
to establish apartness, a constructive form of inequality. $L^{\#}$ does not
require auxiliary notions such as observation tables or discrimination trees,
but operates directly on tree-shaped automata. $L^{\#}$ has the same asymptotic
query and symbol complexities as the best existing learning algorithms, but we
show that adaptive distinguishing sequences can be naturally integrated to
boost the performance of $L^{\#}$ in practice. Experiments with a prototype
implementation, written in Rust, suggest that $L^{\#}$ is competitive with
existing algorithms.

$H$ as an induced subgraph. Already in the early 1980s Alekseev observed that
if $H$ is connected, then the \textsc{Max Weight Independent Set} problem
(MWIS) remains \textsc{NP}-hard in $H$-free graphs, unless $H$ is a path or a
subdivided claw, i.e., a graph obtained from the three-leaf star by subdividing
each edge some number of times (possibly zero). Since then determining the
complexity of MWIS in these remaining cases is one of the most important
problems in algorithmic graph theory.
  A general belief is that the problem is polynomial-time solvable, which is
witnessed by algorithmic results for graphs excluding some small paths or
subdivided claws. A more conclusive evidence was given by the recent
breakthrough result by Gartland and Lokshtanov [FOCS 2020]: They proved that
MWIS can be solved in quasipolynomial time in $H$-free graphs, where $H$ is any
fixed path. If $H$ is an arbitrary subdivided claw, we know much less: The
problem admits a QPTAS and a subexponential-time algorithm [Chudnovsky et al.,
SODA 2019].
  In this paper we make an important step towards solving the problem by
showing that for any subdivided claw $H$, MWIS is polynomial-time solvable in
$H$-free graphs of bounded degree.

mode called extra wide (EW) that offers large regions of ocean areas to be
observed. A major issue with EW images is that the cross-polarized HV and VH
channels have prominent additive noise patterns relative to low backscatter
intensity, which disrupts tasks that require manual or automated
interpretation. The European Space Agency (ESA) provides a method for removing
the additive noise pattern by means of lookup tables, but applying them
directly produces unsatisfactory results because characteristics of the noise
still remain. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the magnitude of the additive
noise dynamically depends on factors that are not considered by the ESA
estimated noise field.
  To address these issues we propose a quadratic objective function to model
the mis-scale of the provided noise field on an image. We consider a linear
denoising model that re-scales the noise field for each subswath, whose
parameters are found from a least-squares solution over the objective function.
This method greatly reduces the presence of additive noise while not requiring
a set of training images, is robust to heterogeneity in images, dynamically
estimates parameters for each image, and finds parameters using a closed-form
solution.
  Two experiments were performed to validate the proposed method. The first
experiment simulated noise removal on a set of RADARSAT-2 images with noise
fields artificially imposed on them. The second experiment conducted noise
removal on a set of Sentinel-1 images taken over the five oceans. Afterwards,
quality of the noise removal was evaluated based on the appearance of
open-water. The two experiments indicate that the proposed method marks an
improvement both visually and through numerical measures.

to different priors over generative model parameters. This provides a formal
explanation for why individuals exhibit inconsistent behavioural preferences
when confronted with similar choices. For example, greedy preferences are a
consequence of confident (or precise) beliefs over certain outcomes. Here, we
offer an alternative account of behavioural variability using R\'enyi
divergences and their associated variational bounds. R\'enyi bounds are
analogous to the variational free energy (or evidence lower bound) and can be
derived under the same assumptions. Importantly, these bounds provide a formal
way to establish behavioural differences through an $\alpha$ parameter, given
fixed priors. This rests on changes in $\alpha$ that alter the bound (on a
continuous scale), inducing different posterior estimates and consequent
variations in behaviour. Thus, it looks as if individuals have different
priors, and have reached different conclusions. More specifically, $\alpha \to
0^{+}$ optimisation leads to mass-covering variational estimates and increased
variability in choice behaviour. Furthermore, $\alpha \to + \infty$
optimisation leads to mass-seeking variational posteriors and greedy
preferences. We exemplify this formulation through simulations of the
multi-armed bandit task. We note that these $\alpha$ parameterisations may be
especially relevant, i.e., shape preferences, when the true posterior is not in
the same family of distributions as the assumed (simpler) approximate density,
which may be the case in many real-world scenarios. The ensuing departure from
vanilla variational inference provides a potentially useful explanation for
differences in behavioural preferences of biological (or artificial) agents
under the assumption that the brain performs variational Bayesian inference.

shift called measurement shift which can be resolved by restoring the source
features rather than extracting new ones. In particular, we propose Feature
Restoration (FR) wherein we: (i) store a lightweight and flexible approximation
of the feature distribution under the source data; and (ii) adapt the
feature-extractor such that the approximate feature distribution under the
target data realigns with that saved on the source. We additionally propose a

Feature Restoration (BUFR). On real and synthetic data, we demonstrate that
BUFR outperforms existing SFDA methods in terms of accuracy, calibration, and

time-frequency transform (NTFT) combing with curve fitting scheme. Compared
with the NTFT, the combined NTFT with a boundary extreme point
mirror-image-symmetric extension (BEPME) process, and singular spectrum
analysis (SSA) in some simulated tests, the superiority and reliability of this
new scheme have been confirmed; and we further verified the validity of it in a
mature case analysis from the Earth's free oscillation modes 0S0 and 1S0. After
then, we use it to restore the ~5.9yr oscillation (referred to as SYO) and
~8.5yr oscillation (referred to as EYO) from the {\Delta}LOD and the PM
records. Our results reconfirm that the SYO and EYO in the {\Delta}LOD (and PM)
have no stable damping trend (which is different from results in some previous
studies), and for the first time, we find that the SYOs (and EYOs) contained in
the {\Delta}LOD and the PM show very good consistency. Such consistency
demonstrates that the SYOs/EYOs in the {\Delta}LOD and the PM must come from
the same source. As the external excitation sources of the Earth rotation
contain no such oscillations, we suggest that core motions are possible
sources.

for best performance. In this work, we focus on accelerating the estimation of
hyper-parameters by proposing two novel methodologies: proxy data and proxy
networks. Both can be useful for estimating hyper-parameters more efficiently.
We test the proposed techniques on CT and MR imaging modalities using
well-known public datasets. In both cases using one dataset for building proxy
data and another data source for external evaluation. For CT, the approach is
tested on spleen segmentation with two datasets. The first dataset is from the
medical segmentation decathlon (MSD), where the proxy data is constructed, the
secondary dataset is utilized as an external validation dataset. Similarly, for
MR, the approach is evaluated on prostate segmentation where the first dataset
is from MSD and the second dataset is PROSTATEx. First, we show higher
correlation to using full data for training when testing on the external
validation set using smaller proxy data than a random selection of the proxy
data. Second, we show that a high correlation exists for proxy networks when
compared with the full network on validation Dice score. Third, we show that

existing recommendation techniques do not consider the noise contained in
implicit feedback, which will lead to the biased representation of user
interest and a suboptimal recommendation performance. Meanwhile, the existing
methods utilize item sequence for capturing the evolution of user interest. The
performance of these methods is limited by the length of the sequence, and can
not effectively model the long-term interest in a long period of time. Based on
this observation, we propose a novel CTR model named denoising user-aware

purification module based on orthogonal mapping, which use the representation
of explicit feedback to purify the representation of implicit feedback, and
effectively denoise the implicit feedback; (ii) designs a user memory network

of the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation signal (BAO) in the Dark Energy Survey (DES)
Y3 data. The definition is based on a colour and redshift-dependent magnitude
cut optimized to select galaxies at redshifts higher than 0.5, while ensuring a
high quality photometric redshift determination. The sample covers $\approx
4100$ square degrees to a depth of $i = 22.3 \ (AB)$ at $10\sigma$. It contains
7,031,993 galaxies in the redshift range from $z$= 0.6 to 1.1, with a mean
effective redshift of 0.835. Photometric redshifts are estimated with the
machine learning algorithm DNF, and are validated using the VIPERS PDR2 sample.
We find a mean redshift bias of $z_{\mathrm{bias}} \approx 0.01$ and a mean
uncertainty, in units of $1+z$, of $\sigma_{68} \approx 0.03$. We evaluate the
galaxy population of the sample, showing it is mostly built upon Elliptical to
Sbc types. Furthermore, we find a low level of stellar contamination of
$\lesssim 4\%$. We present the method used to mitigate the effect of spurious
clustering coming from observing conditions and other large-scale systematics.
We apply it to the DES Y3 BAO sample and calculate sample weights that are used
to get a robust estimate of the galaxy clustering signal. This paper is one of
a series dedicated to the analysis of the BAO signal in the DES Y3 data. In the
companion papers, Ferrero et al. (2021) and DES Collaboration (2021), we
present the galaxy mock catalogues used to calibrate the analysis and the
angular diameter distance constraints obtained through the fitting to the BAO
scale, respectively. The galaxy sample, masks and additional material will be
released in the public DES data repository upon acceptance.

functions. Here, we focus on the molecular multiplex networks coupled by the
transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) and protein-protein interaction (PPI)
network, exploring the controllability and energy requiring in these types of
molecular multiplex networks. We find that the driver nodes tend to avoid
essential or pathogen-related genes. Yet, imposing the external inputs to these
essential or pathogen-related genes can remarkably reduce the energy cost,
implying their crucial role in network control. Moreover, we find that lower
minimal driver nodes as well as energy requiring are associated with
disassortative coupling between TRN and PPI networks. Our findings in several

push for larger, more accurate -- and hence more useful -- quantum computers.
While fully fault-tolerant quantum computers are, in principle, capable of
achieving arbitrarily accurate calculations using devices subjected to general
noise, they require immense resources far beyond our current reach. An
intermediate step would be to construct quantum computers of limited accuracy
enhanced by lower-level, and hence lower-cost, noise-removal techniques. This
is the motivation for our work, which looks into fault-tolerant encoded quantum
computation targeted at the dominant noise afflicting the quantum device.
Specifically, we develop a protocol for fault-tolerant encoded quantum
computing components in the presence of amplitude-damping noise, using a
4-qubit code and a recovery procedure tailored to such noise. We describe a
universal set of fault-tolerant encoded gadgets and compute the pseudothreshold
for the noise, below which our scheme leads to more accurate computation. Our
work demonstrates the possibility of applying the ideas of quantum fault
tolerance to targeted noise models, generalizing the recent pursuit of
biased-noise fault tolerance beyond the usual Pauli noise models. We also
illustrate how certain aspects of the standard fault tolerance intuition,
largely acquired through Pauli-noise considerations, can fail in the face of
more general noise.

developing fast algorithmic methods for approximating the number of solutions
to constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) with large arities, using
connections to the Lovasz Local Lemma. Nevertheless, the boundaries of these
methods for CSPs with non-Boolean domain are not well-understood. Our goal in
this paper is to fill in this gap and obtain strong inapproximability results
by studying the prototypical problem in this class of CSPs, hypergraph
colourings.
  More precisely, we focus on the problem of approximately counting
$q$-colourings on $K$-uniform hypergraphs with bounded degree $\Delta$. An
efficient algorithm exists if $\Delta\lesssim \frac{q^{K/3-1}}{4^KK^2}$ (Jain,
Pham, and Vuong, 2021; He, Sun, and Wu, 2021). Somewhat surprisingly however, a
hardness bound is not known even for the easier problem of finding colourings.
For the counting problem, the situation is even less clear and there is no
evidence of the right constant controlling the growth of the exponent in terms
of $K$.
  To this end, we first establish that for general $q$ computational hardness
for finding a colouring on simple/linear hypergraphs occurs at $\Delta\gtrsim
Kq^K$, almost matching the algorithm from the Lovasz Local Lemma. Our second
and main contribution is to obtain a far more refined bound for the counting
problem that goes well beyond the hardness of finding a colouring and which we
conjecture that is asymptotically tight (up to constant factors). We show in
particular that for all even $q\geq 4$ it is NP-hard to approximate the number
of colourings when $\Delta\gtrsim q^{K/2}$.

However, multiple tracers are needed to measure glucose metabolism (18F-FDG),
synaptic vesicle protein (11C-UCB-J), and $\beta$-amyloid (11C-PiB).
Administering multiple tracers to patient will lead to high radiation dose and
cost. In addition, access to PET scans using new or less-available tracers with
sophisticated production methods and short half-life isotopes may be very
limited. Thus, it is desirable to develop an efficient multi-tracer PET
synthesis model that can generate multi-tracer PET from single-tracer PET.
Previous works on medical image synthesis focus on one-to-one fixed domain
translations, and cannot simultaneously learn the feature from multi-tracer
domains. Given 3 or more tracers, relying on previous methods will also create
a heavy burden on the number of models to be trained. To tackle these issues,
we propose a 3D unified anatomy-aware cyclic adversarial network (UCAN) for
translating multi-tracer PET volumes with one unified generative model, where
MR with anatomical information is incorporated. Evaluations on a multi-tracer

have employed evolutionary algorithm and first-principles calculations to
comprehensively examine the structural stability and superconductivity of the
YMgH$_{x}$ system at high pressure. The hydrogen content $x$ and the pressure
are both important factors in the stability of these candidate structures. We
find that the stability of hydrogen-rich materials frequently necessitates
higher pressure. For instance, the pressures to stabilize $P4/mmm$-YMgH$_{8}$
and $Cmmm$-YMgH$_{12}$ are both more than 250 GPa. Hydrogen-less materials,
such as $I4_{1}/amd$-YMgH$_{2}$ and $P6_{3}/mmc$-YMgH$_{3}$, can be stable at
pressures as low as 100 GPa. In addition, we find a metastable structure for
YMgH$_{6}$ with the same space group as the $P4/mmm$-YMgH$_{8}$. A metastable
sodalite-like face-centered cubic (FCC) structure is also found in YMgH$_{12}$.
These four clathrate structures of $P4/mmm$-YMgH$_{6}$, $P4/mmm$-YMgH$_{8}$,
$Cmmm$-YMgH$_{12}$, and $Fd\bar{3}m$-YMgH$_{12}$ is made up of H14, H18, H24,

bonding. According to phonon calculations, $P4/mmm$-YMgH$_{6}$ and
$P4/mmm$-YMgH$_{8}$ require a pressure of 300 GPa to maintain dynamic
stability, however $Cmmm$-YMgH$_{12}$ and $Fd\bar{3}m$-YMgH$_{12}$ can maintain
dynamic stability at pressures of 200 GPa and 250 GPa, respectively.
Electron-phonon coupling calculations indicate that they might be potential

generally involves a set of measurements, to which one attempts to fit a
numerical model of the measurement process. The model evaluation typically
involves to solve Maxwell's equations and is thus time consuming. This makes
the reconstruction computationally demanding. Several methods exist for fitting
the model to the measurements. On the one hand, Bayesian optimization methods
for expensive black-box optimization enable an efficient reconstruction by
training a machine learning model of the squared sum of deviations. On the
other hand, curve fitting algorithms, such as the Levenberg-Marquardt method,
take the deviations between all model outputs and corresponding measurement
values into account which enables a fast local convergence. In this paper we
present a Bayesian Target Vector Optimization scheme which combines these two
approaches. We compare the performance of the presented method against a
standard Levenberg-Marquardt-like algorithm, a conventional Bayesian
optimization scheme, and the L-BFGS-B and Nelder-Mead simplex algorithms. As a
stand-in for problems from nano metrology, we employ a non-linear least-square
problem from the NIST Standard Reference Database. We find that the presented
method generally uses fewer calls of the model function than any of the
competing schemes to achieve similar reconstruction performance.

Spin-Exchange Relaxation Free (SERF) magnetometry is one of the most powerful

deteriorating the pseudo-magnetic coupling sensitivity. To address this
problem, here, we compare, via numerical simulations, the performance of SERF
magnetometer and noble-gas-alkali-metal co-magnetometer, operating in a
so-called self-compensating regime. We demonstrate that the co-magnetometer
allows reduction of the sensitivity to low-frequency magnetic fields without
loss of the sensitivity to nonmagnetic couplings. Based on that we investigate
the responses of both systems to the oscillating and transient spin
perturbations. Our simulations reveal about five orders of magnitude stronger
response to the neutron pseudo-magnetic coupling and about three orders of
magnitude stronger response to the proton pseudo-magnetic coupling of the
co-magnetometer than those of the SERF magnetometer. Different frequency
responses of the co-magnetometer to magnetic and nonmagnetic perturbations
enables differentiation between these two types of interactions. This outlines
the ability to implement the co-magnetometer as an advanced sensor for the

interaction of shock waves with density inhomogeneities. We consider here the
particular instance of a planar air shock impinging on a spherical
water-droplet and discuss to what extent this interaction can lead to the
inception of cavitation inside the droplet. The effort centers on the early
phases of the interaction process during which the geometry and amplitude of
the propagating wavefront is modified by refraction and the subsequent internal
reflections at the droplet interface. The problem is analysed using both simple
ray theory and a 2-D multiphase, compressible hydrodynamic code (ECOGEN).
Within the context of ray theory, the occurrence of focusing is examined in
details and parametric equations are derived for the transmitted wavefront and
its multiple internal reflections. It is found that wave patterns predicted by
ray calculations compare extremely well with the more accurate numerical
solutions from simulations. In particular, it is shown that the internal
wavefront assumes a complex time-dependent shape whose dominant feature is the
existence of cusp singularities. These singular points are shown to trace out
surfaces that are the caustics of the associated system of rays. From the
singularities of the energy flux density of the refracted wave, the parametric
equations of the caustic surface associated to the $k$-th reflected wavefront
are deduced. As a consequence of the focusing process, the simulations show the
formation of negative-pressure regions in the internal flow field. These
low-pressure zones are identified as possible spots where cavitation may occur,
depending on the magnitude of the pressure reached. Finally, the numerical
results provide quantitative information on the dependence of negative pressure
peak upon incident-shock-wave strength.

CSI. Specifically, we first estimate the overall channel matrix based on the

performance of MSE and normalized MSE (NMSE). Then, with the estimated channel,
we derive the closed-form expressions of the ergodic rate. The derived

at a non-zero value when the transmit power is scaled down proportionally to
$1/M$ or $1/N^2$, where $M$ and $N$ are the number of antennas and reflecting

cluster-based systems, due to its efficient support for short, one-sided
messages. However, there are currently two major limitations faced by PGAS
applications. The first relates to scalability: despite the availability of
APIs that support non-blocking operations in special cases, many PGAS
operations on remote locations are synchronous by default, which can lead to
long-latency stalls and poor scalability. The second relates to productivity:
while it is simpler for the developer to express all communications at a
fine-grained granularity that is natural to the application, experiments have
shown that such a natural expression results in performance that is 20x slower
than more efficient but less productive code that requires manual message
aggregation and termination detection.
  In this paper, we introduce a new programming system for PGAS applications,
in which point-to-point remote operations can be expressed as fine-grained
asynchronous actor messages. In this approach, the programmer does not need to
worry about programming complexities related to message aggregation and
termination detection. Our approach can also be viewed as extending the
classical Bulk Synchronous Parallelism model with fine-grained asynchronous
communications within a phase or superstep. We believe that our approach offers
a desirable point in the productivity-performance space for PGAS applications,
with more scalable performance and higher productivity relative to past
approaches. Specifically, for seven irregular mini-applications from the Bale
benchmark suite executed using 2048 cores in the NERSC Cori system, our
approach shows geometric mean performance improvements of >=20x relative to
standard PGAS versions (UPC and OpenSHMEM) while maintaining comparable
productivity to those versions.

elasticity and resilience) and biologically relevant functions (e.g.,
triggering responses like cell adhesion or chemotaxis). It is formed from its
precursor tropoelastin, a 60-72 kDa water-soluble and temperature-responsive
protein that coacervates at physiological temperature, undergoing a phenomenon
termed lower critical solution temperature (LCST). Inspired by this behaviour,
many scientists and engineers are developing recombinantly produced
elastin-inspired biopolymers, usually termed elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs).
These ELPs are generally comprised of repetitive motifs with the sequence
VPGXG, which corresponds to repeats of a small part of the tropoelastin
sequence, X being any amino acid except proline. ELPs display LCST and
mechanical properties similar to tropoelastin, which renders them promising
candidates for the development of elastic and stimuli-responsive protein-based
materials. Unveiling the structure-property relationships of ELPs can aid in
the development of these materials by establishing the connections between the
ELP amino acid sequence and the macroscopic properties of the materials. Here
we present a review of the structure-property relationships of ELPs and

well-studied graph classes with underlying geometry. In this paper, we identify
this class as a special case in the broader class of hyperbolic unit disk
graphs and introduce strongly hyperbolic unit disk graphs as a natural
counterpart to the Euclidean variant. In contrast to the grid-like structures
exhibited by Euclidean unit disk graphs, strongly hyperbolic networks feature
hierarchical structures, which are also observed in complex real-world
networks.
  We investigate basic properties of strongly hyperbolic unit disk graphs,
including adjacencies and the formation of cliques, and utilize the derived
insights to demonstrate that the class is useful for the development and
analysis of graph algorithms. Specifically, we develop a simple greedy routing
scheme and analyze its performance on strongly hyperbolic unit disk graphs in
order to prove that routing can be performed more efficiently on such networks
than in general.

Stokes numbers particles always destabilize the flow (as already predicted by
Saffman in the limit of very thin particles), at sufficiently large Stokes

can both stabilize and destabilize the flow. Numerical analysis is used to
validate the analytical predictions. We find that in a region of the parameter

that this is a consequence of the breakdown of the scale separation

physics and astrophysics applications, as they determine properties ranging
from the neutron-skin thickness of nuclei to the crust thickness and the radius
of neutron stars. Recently, PREX-II reported a value of $0.283\pm0.071$ fm for
the neutron-skin thickness of $^{208}$Pb, $R_{\rm skin}^{^{208}\text{Pb}}$,
implying a symmetry-energy slope parameter $L$ of $106\pm37$ MeV, larger than
most ranges obtained from microscopic calculations and other nuclear
experiments. We use a nonparametric equation of state representation based on
Gaussian processes to constrain the symmetry energy $S_0$, $L$, and $R_{\rm

minimal modeling assumptions. The resulting astrophysical constraints from
heavy pulsar masses, LIGO/Virgo, and NICER favor smaller values of the neutron
skin and $L$, as well as negative symmetry incompressibilities. Combining
astrophysical data with chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) and PREX-II
constraints yields $S_0 = 33.0^{+2.0}_{-1.8}$ MeV, $L=53^{+14}_{-15}$ MeV, and
$R_{\rm skin}^{^{208}\text{Pb}} = 0.17^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$ fm. We also examine the

""exploitaton"" for renters. While much of this gap might be explained by risk,
factors such as income and race might play important roles as well. This study
calculates Census tract-level measures of the rent-to-property-value (RPV)

examining the spatial distribution of this ratio and relationships with other
socioeconomic variables for Milwaukee and three other cities, Z-scores and
quantiles are used to identify ""extreme"" RPV values nationwide. ""Rust Belt""
cities such as Detroit, Cleveland, and Milwaukee are shown to have higher

the ""opposite"" signs from what might be expected and that there is little
evidence of purely race-based ""exploitation"" of renters. A significantly
negative coefficient for the percentage of Black residents, for example, might
suggest that the RPV ratio is lower in a given tract, all else equal. While

out-of-distribution actions. We prove that CODAC learns a conservative return
distribution -- in particular, for finite MDPs, CODAC converges to an uniform
lower bound on the quantiles of the return distribution; our proof relies on a
novel analysis of the distributional Bellman operator. In our experiments, on
two challenging robot navigation tasks, CODAC successfully learns risk-averse
policies using offline data collected purely from risk-neutral agents.
Furthermore, CODAC is state-of-the-art on the D4RL MuJoCo benchmark in terms of
both expected and risk-sensitive performance.

deploy some fine-tuning techniques to adjust the pre-training ResNet50.
Furthermore, to improve the model's generalizability, we use ensemble learning
to integrate prediction results from multiple base classifiers generated using
different random seeds. To evaluate the proposed DiCOVA-Net's performance, we
conducted experiments with the DiCOVA challenge dataset. The results show that

proposed a spatial-temporal model of a photon based on classical model of
atomic oscillator. Using this photon model, we established a criterion for
single vs multi-photon irradiation of matter. We demonstrated that the
assumption that induced dipole radiation can be of infinitely small power is
inconsistent with quantum mechanics. We proposed the energy criteria for
scattering of a photon on single and multiple atoms and free electrons. This
criterion revealed the limitations and applicability of Rayleigh's and
Thomson's models of scattering. According to our theory, light scattering is a
threshold process, and the scattering can only take place for those photons
with wavelengths shorter than some threshold. Using our model, we computed the
loss of energy by a photon with wavelengths longer than the scattering
threshold during interaction with bound and free electrons. We showed that a
single photon can lose energy in collisionless interaction with atoms,
molecules, and free electrons. The new theoretical model predicts the red shift
of photon wavelength resulting from such interactions. In particular, it
provides an explanation for the blue color of sky and an alternative
explanation for the cosmological red shift.

processes, popular for their relative simplicity. They are traditionally
defined via their marginal distributions, but a subset of DPPs called
""L-ensembles"" have tractable likelihoods and are thus particularly easy to work
with. Indeed, in many applications, DPPs are more naturally defined based on
the L-ensemble formulation rather than through the marginal kernel. The fact
that not all DPPs are L-ensembles is unfortunate, but there is a unifying
description. We introduce here extended L-ensembles, and show that all DPPs are
extended L-ensembles (and vice-versa). Extended L-ensembles have very simple
likelihood functions, contain L-ensembles and projection DPPs as special cases.
From a theoretical standpoint, they fix some pathologies in the usual formalism
of DPPs, for instance the fact that projection DPPs are not L-ensembles. From a
practical standpoint, they extend the set of kernel functions that may be used
to define DPPs: we show that conditional positive definite kernels are good
candidates for defining DPPs, including DPPs that need no spatial scale
parameter. Finally, extended L-ensembles are based on so-called ``saddle-point
matrices'', and we prove an extension of the Cauchy-Binet theorem for such

dissipation in microelectronics. However, in dielectric nanomaterials, the
primary heat carriers - phonons - can propagate ballistically only for hundreds
of nanometres, which limits their heat conduction efficiency. Theory predicts
that surface phonon-polaritons (SPhPs) can overcome this limitation and conduct
heat without dissipation for hundreds of micrometres. In this work, we
experimentally demonstrate such long-distance heat transport by SPhPs. Using
the 3$\omega$ technique, we measure the in-plane thermal conductivity of SiN
nanomembranes for different heater-sensor distances (100 and 200 $\mu$m),
membrane thicknesses (30 - 200 nm), and temperatures (300 - 400 K). We find
that in contrast with thick membranes, thin nanomembranes support heat
conduction by SPhPs, as evidenced by an increase in the thermal conductivity
with temperature. Remarkably, the thermal conductivity measured 200 $\mu$m away
from the heater are consistently higher than that measured 100 $\mu$m closer.
This result suggests that heat conduction by SPhPs is quasi-ballistic over at
least hundreds of micrometres. Thus, our findings show that SPhPs can enhance
heat dissipation in polar nanomembranes and find applications in thermal
management, near-field radiation, and polaritonics.

for a linearly ordered set $(X,<)$ a natural topology should be the topology

topology to be called ""natural"", has been largely ignored while studying
topological properties of spacetime manifolds $(M,g)$ where $g$ is the Lorentz

ignoring the spacetime ""metric"" $g$. In this survey we review critically
candidate topologies for a relativistic spacetime manifold, we pose open
questions and conjectures with the aim to establish a complete guide on the
latest results in the field, and give the foundations for future discussions.
We discuss the criticism against the manifold topology, a criticism that was
initiated by people like Zeeman, G\""obel, Hawking-King-McCarthy and others, and
we examine what should be meant by the term ""natural topology"" for a spacetime.
Since the common criticism against spacetime topologies, other than the
manifold topology, claims that there has not been established yet a physical
theory to justify such topologies, we give examples of seemingly physical
phenomena, under the manifold topology, which are actually purely effects
depending on the choice of the topology; the Limit Curve Theorem, which is
linked to singularity theorems in general relativity, and the Theorem of

converting HTML to plain text. Its development has been triggered by the need
to obtain accurate text representations for knowledge extraction tasks that
preserve the spatial alignment of text without drawing upon heavyweight,
browser-based solutions such as Selenium. In contrast to related software
packages, Inscriptis (i) provides a layout-aware conversion of HTML that more
closely resembles the rendering obtained from standard Web browsers; and (ii)
supports annotation rules, i.e., user-provided mappings that allow for
annotating the extracted text based on structural and semantic information
encoded in HTML tags and attributes. These unique features ensure that
downstream knowledge extraction components can operate on accurate text
representations, and may even use information on the semantics and structure of
the original HTML document.

enhancing the local electric field in a metamolecule composed of two
radiatively coupled cut-wire resonators where resonance of the cut-wire
resonators and low-group-velocity propagation of an incident electromagnetic
wave simultaneously occur. Numerical analysis shows that the local electric
field in the metamolecule can be enhanced by decreasing the electrode size and
the gap of the capacitor structure of the cut-wire resonators while keeping the
equivalent electrical circuit parameters of the metamolecule constant. We
measure and compare the threshold incident power for a gas discharge in the
metamolecule fabricated in our previous study and that in the metamolecule with
shrunken capacitor structures. The experiment reveals that shrinking the
capacitor structure while keeping the resonance frequency of the metamolecule
decreases the threshold incident power for a gas discharge and may increase the
gas pressure where the threshold incident power is minimum. Further development
of this work will enable us to realize efficient nonlinear metamaterials that
have atmospheric-pressure gas as a nonlinear element.

  Differential Mechanism","6 pages and 10 figures",,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper presents the design of an in-pipe climbing robot that operates
using a novel `Three-output open differential'(3-OOD) mechanism to traverse
complex networks of pipes. Conventional wheeled/tracked in-pipe climbing robots
are prone to slip and drag while traversing in pipe bends. The 3-OOD mechanism
helps in achieving the novel result of eliminating slip and drag in the robot
tracks during motion. The proposed differential realizes the functional
abilities of the traditional two-output differential, which is achieved the
first time for a differential with three outputs. The 3-OOD mechanism
mechanically modulates the track speeds of the robot based on the forces
exerted on each track inside the pipe network, by eliminating the need for any
active control. The simulation of the robot traversing in the pipe network in
different orientations and in pipe-bends without slip shows the proposed
design's effectiveness.

  Current Threats, Research, and Opportunities",,,,,"cs.NI cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  UAVs are increasingly appearing in swarms or formations to leverage
cooperative behavior, forming flying ad hoc networks. These UAV-enabled
networks can meet several complex mission requirements and are seen as a
potential enabler for many of the emerging use-cases in future communication
networks. Such networks, however, are characterized by a highly dynamic and
mobile environment with no guarantee of a central network infrastructure which
can cause both connectivity and security issues. While wireless mesh networks
are envisioned as a solution for such scenarios, these networks come with their
own challenges and security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we analyze the key
security and resilience issues resulting from the application of wireless mesh
networks within UAV swarms. Specifically, we highlight the main challenges of
applying current mesh technologies within the domain of UAV swarms and expose
existing vulnerabilities across the communication stack. Based on this
analysis, we present a security-focused architecture for UAV mesh
communications. Finally, from the identification of these vulnerabilities, we
discuss research opportunities posed by the unique challenges of UAV swarm
connectivity.
