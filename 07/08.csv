  algorithms","62 pages, 7 figures",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG stat.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We establish an equivalence between the $\ell_2$-regularized solution path
for a convex loss function, and the solution of an ordinary differentiable
equation (ODE). Importantly, this equivalence reveals that the solution path
can be viewed as the flow of a hybrid of gradient descent and Newton method
applying to the empirical loss, which is similar to a widely used optimization
technique called trust region method. This provides an interesting algorithmic
view of $\ell_2$ regularization, and is in contrast to the conventional view
that the $\ell_2$ regularization solution path is similar to the gradient flow
of the empirical loss.New path-following algorithms based on homotopy methods
and numerical ODE solvers are proposed to numerically approximate the solution
path. In particular, we consider respectively Newton method and gradient
descent method as the basis algorithm for the homotopy method, and establish
their approximation error rates over the solution path. Importantly, our theory
suggests novel schemes to choose grid points that guarantee an arbitrarily
small suboptimality for the solution path. In terms of computational cost, we
prove that in order to achieve an $\epsilon$-suboptimality for the entire
solution path, the number of Newton steps required for the Newton method is
$\mathcal O(\epsilon^{-1/2})$, while the number of gradient steps required for
the gradient descent method is $\mathcal O\left(\epsilon^{-1}
\ln(\epsilon^{-1})\right)$. Finally, we use $\ell_2$-regularized logistic
regression as an illustrating example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed path-following algorithms.

particle radiation, in turn, can synthesize short-lived radioactive nuclei
through spallation. With a focus on $^{26}$Al, this paper estimates the
expected abundances of radioactive nulcei produced by spallation during the
epoch of planet formation. In this model, cosmic rays are accelerated near the
inner truncation radii of circumstellar disks, $r_{\scriptstyle X}\approx0.1$
AU, where intense magnetic activity takes place. For planets forming in this
region, radioactive abundances can be enhanced over the values inferred for the
early solar system (from meteoritic measurements) by factors of $\sim10-20$.
These short-lived radioactive nuclei influence the process of planet formation
and the properties of planets in several ways. The minimum size required for
planetesimals to become fully molten decreases with increasing levels of
radioactive enrichment, and such melting leads to loss of volatile components
including water. Planets produced with an enhanced radioactive inventory have
significant internal luminosity which can be comparable to that provided by the
host star; this additional heating affects both atmospheric mass loss and
chemical composition. Finally, the habitable zone of red dwarf stars is
coincident with the magnetic reconnection region, so that planets forming at

the most fundamental tasks in quantum science. In this work, we identify
conditions on states under which it is possible to infer the expectation values
of all quasi-local observables of a state from a number of copies that scales
polylogarithmically with the system's size and polynomially on the locality of
the target observables. We show that this constitutes a provable exponential
improvement in the number of copies over state-of-the-art tomography protocols.
We achieve our results by combining the maximum entropy method with tools from
the emerging fields of classical shadows and quantum optimal transport. The
latter allows us to fine-tune the error made in estimating the expectation
value of an observable in terms of how local it is and how well we approximate
the expectation value of a fixed set of few-body observables. We conjecture
that our condition holds for all states exhibiting some form of decay of
correlations and establish it for several subsets thereof. These include widely
studied classes of states such as one-dimensional thermal and high-temperature
Gibbs states of local commuting Hamiltonians on arbitrary hypergraphs or
outputs of shallow circuits. Moreover, we show improvements of the maximum

heterogeneity of contact patterns. We provide an analysis which helps quantify,
in real time, the probability that an epidemic goes supercritical or
conversely, dies stochastically. These probabilities are often assumed to be
one and zero, respectively, if the basic reproduction number, or R0, is greater
than 1, ignoring the heterogeneity and randomness inherent to disease spread.

size of the source of influence $q_c$ in case of conformity is independent from
the size of the source of influence $q_a$ in case of anticonformity. For
$q_c=q_a=q$ the model reduces to the original $q$-voter model with
anticonformity. Previously, such a generalized model was studied only on the
complete graph, which corresponds to the mean-field approach. It was shown that
it can display discontinuous phase transitions for $q_c \ge q_a + \Delta q$,
where $\Delta q=4$ for $q_a \le 3$ and $\Delta q=3$ for $q_a>3$. In this paper,
we pose the question if discontinuous phase transitions survive on random
graphs with an average node degree $\langle k\rangle \le 150$ observed
empirically in social networks. Using the pair approximation, as well as Monte
Carlo simulations, we show that discontinuous phase transitions indeed can
survive, even for relatively small values of $\langle k\rangle$. Moreover, we
show that for $q_a < q_c - 1$ pair approximation results overlap the Monte
Carlo ones. On the other hand, for $q_a \ge q_c - 1$ pair approximation gives
qualitatively wrong results indicating discontinuous phase transitions neither
observed in the simulations nor within the mean-field approach. Finally, we
report an intriguing result showing that the difference between the spinodals
obtained within the pair approximation and the mean-field approach follows a
power law with respect to $\langle k\rangle$, as long as the pair approximation
indicates correctly the type of the phase transition.

comprehensive overview of uncertainty estimation in neural networks, reviews
recent advances in the field, highlights current challenges, and identifies
potential research opportunities. It is intended to give anyone interested in
uncertainty estimation in neural networks a broad overview and introduction,
without presupposing prior knowledge in this field. A comprehensive
introduction to the most crucial sources of uncertainty is given and their
separation into reducible model uncertainty and not reducible data uncertainty
is presented. The modeling of these uncertainties based on deterministic neural
networks, Bayesian neural networks, ensemble of neural networks, and test-time
data augmentation approaches is introduced and different branches of these
fields as well as the latest developments are discussed. For a practical
application, we discuss different measures of uncertainty, approaches for the
calibration of neural networks and give an overview of existing baselines and
implementations. Different examples from the wide spectrum of challenges in
different fields give an idea of the needs and challenges regarding
uncertainties in practical applications. Additionally, the practical
limitations of current methods for mission- and safety-critical real world
applications are discussed and an outlook on the next steps towards a broader
usage of such methods is given.

to conventional methods such as Shannon's sampling. In time-encoding, the
signal is encoded using a sequence of time instants where an event occurs, and
hence fall under event-driven sampling methods. Time-encoding can be designed
agnostic to the global clock of the sampling hardware, which makes sampling
asynchronous. Moreover, the encoding is sparse. This makes time-encoding energy
efficient. However, the signal representation is nonstandard and in general,
nonuniform. In this paper, we consider time-encoding of
finite-rate-of-innovation signals, and in particular, periodic signals composed
of weighted and time-shifted versions of a known pulse. We consider encoding
using both crossing-time-encoding machine (C-TEM) and integrate-and-fire
time-encoding machine (IF-TEM). We analyze how time-encoding manifests in the
Fourier domain and arrive at the familiar sum-of-sinusoids structure of the
Fourier coefficients that can be obtained starting from the time-encoded
measurements via a suitable linear transformation. Thereafter, standard FRI
techniques become applicable. Further, we extend the theory to multichannel
time-encoding such that each channel operates with a lower sampling
requirement. We also study the effect of measurement noise, where the temporal
measurements are perturbed by additive noise. To combat the effect of noise, we
propose a robust optimization framework to simultaneously denoise the Fourier
coefficients and estimate the annihilating filter accurately. We provide
sufficient conditions for time-encoding and perfect reconstruction using C-TEM
and IF-TEM, and furnish extensive simulations to substantiate our findings.

one of the pillars of smart grids. In some countries, despite the presence of

confines such innovative solutions to the prototypal and experimental level. We
take inspiration from the technology adopted in Italy, where the national
regulatory authority actively supported the definition of a solution agreed
upon by all the involved stakeholders. In this context, smart meters are
enabled to convey data to low voltage end users through a power line
communication channel (CHAIN 2) in near real-time. The aim of this paper is
twofold. On the one hand, it describes the proof of concept that the channel
underwent and its subsequent validation (with performances nearing 99% success
rate). On the other hand, it defines a classification framework (I2MA) for
post-metering value-added services, in order to categorize each use case based
on both level of service and expected benefits, and understand its maturity
level. As an example, we apply the methodology to the 16 use cases defined in
Italy. The lessons learned from the regulatory, technological, and functional
approach of the Italian experience bring us to the provision of recommendations
for researchers and industry experts. In particular, we argue that a
well-functioning post-metering value-added services' market can flourish when:
i) distribution system operators certify the measurements coming from smart
meters; ii) national regulatory authorities support the technological
innovation needed for setting up this market; and iii) service providers create
customer-oriented solutions based on smart meters' data.

deformed cluster configurations predicted by antisymmetrized molecular dynamics

under the presence of an adversary, who can manipulate the network by
perturbing its edge weights to gain an advantage over others. Specifically, we
introduce the Force Path Problem as follows. Given a network, the adversary's
goal is to make a specific path the shortest by adding weights to edges in the

NP-complete. However, we show that Force Path can be solved to within arbitrary

hot interior adiabats, and recent theoretical work has shown that the interior
evolution of hot Jupiters has a significant impact on their atmospheric
structure. Due to its inflated radius, low gravity, and ultra-hot equilibrium
temperature, WASP-76b is an ideal case study for the impact of internal
evolution on observable properties. Hot interiors should most strongly affect
the non-irradiated side of the planet, and thus full phase curve observations
are critical to ascertain the effect of the interior on the atmospheres of hot
Jupiters. In this work, we present the first Spitzer phase curve observations
of WASP-76b. We find that WASP-76b has an ultra-hot day side and relatively
cold nightside with brightness temperatures of $2471 \pm 27~\mathrm{K}$/$1518
\pm 61~\mathrm{K}$ at $3.6~\micron$ and $2699 \pm 32~\mathrm{K}$/$1259 \pm
44~\mathrm{K}$ at $4.5~\micron$, respectively. These results provide evidence
for a dayside thermal inversion. Both channels exhibit small phase offsets of
$0.68 \pm 0.48^{\circ}$ at $3.6~\micron$ and $0.67 \pm 0.2^{\circ}$ at
$4.5~\mu\mathrm{m}$. We compare our observations to a suite of general
circulation models that consider two end-members of interior temperature along
with a broad range of frictional drag strengths. Strong frictional drag is
necessary to match the small phase offsets and cold nightside temperatures
observed. From our suite of cloud-free GCMs, we find that only cases with a
cold interior can reproduce the cold nightsides and large phase curve amplitude
at $4.5~\micron$, hinting that the hot interior adiabat of WASP-76b does not
significantly impact its atmospheric dynamics or that clouds blanket its

inherited from the interstellar medium and material reprocessed during disk
formation and evolution. Indeed, comets and primitive meteorites exhibit
interstellar-like isotopic ratios and/or volatile compositions, supporting that
some pristine material was incorporated intact into icy planetesimals in the
Solar Nebula. To date, the survival of volatile interstellar material in the
disk stage has not been modeled using realistic disk physics. Here, we present
a modeling framework to track the destruction of interstellar ices on dust
grains undergoing transport processes within a disk, with a particular focus on
explaining the incorporation of pristine material into icy planetesimals. We
find it is difficult to explain inheritance through the local assembly of
comets, as ice destruction is rapid for small (<10um) grains in the inner few
tens of au. Instead, a plausible pathway to inheritance is to form pebbles at
larger disk radii, which then drift inwards to the comet-forming zone with
their ices mostly preserved. Small grains beyond ~100 au can experience ice
photodissociation at the tens of percent level, however little of the ice is
actually lost from the grain, likely making this a robust site for in situ ice
chemistry. Our models also indicate that many complex organic species should
survive passage through the disk intact. This raises the possibility that
organics synthesized in the interstellar medium can be delivered to terrestrial
planets by icy body impact and thus potentially participate in origins of life
chemistry.

this paper, we propose the `gradient-enhancing term' that concentrates on the

explicitly performs gradient enhancement in the anisotropic region so that the
intra-class distribution continues to shrink, resulting in isotropic and more
compact intra-class distribution and further margin between identities. The
experimental results on LFW, YTF and CFP-FP show that our outperforms

lunar formation remain poorly understood and debated. \'Cuk et al. (2016)
proposed that an impact that left the Earth-Moon system with high obliquity and
angular momentum could explain the Moon's orbital inclination and isotopic
similarity to Earth. In this scenario, instability during the Laplace Plane
transition, when the Moon's orbit transitions from the gravitational influence
of Earth's figure to that of the Sun, would both lower the system's angular
momentum to its present-day value and generate the Moon's orbital inclination.
Recently, Tian and Wisdom (2020) discovered new dynamical constraints on the
Laplace Plane transition and concluded that the Earth-Moon system could not
have evolved from an initial state with high obliquity. Here we demonstrate
that the Earth-Moon system with an initially high obliquity can evolve into the
present state, and we identify a spin-orbit secular resonance as a key
dynamical mechanism in the later stages of the Laplace Plane transition. Some
of the simulations by Tian and Wisdom (2020) did not encounter this late
secular resonance, as their model suppressed obliquity tides and the resulting
inclination damping. Our results demonstrate that a giant impact that left
Earth with high angular momentum and high obliquity ($\theta > 61^{\circ}$) is
a promising scenario for explaining many properties of the Earth-Moon system,
including its angular momentum and obliquity, the geochemistry of Earth and the
Moon, and the lunar inclination.

research line focuses on incorporating neural networks with the statistical
model -- marked point processes, which is the conventional tool for dealing
with attributed event sequences. Neural marked point processes possess good
interpretability of probabilistic models as well as the representational power
of neural networks. However, we find that performance of neural marked point
processes is not always increasing as the network architecture becomes more
complicated and larger, which is what we call the performance saturation
phenomenon. This is due to the fact that the generalization error of neural
marked point processes is determined by both the network representational
ability and the model specification at the same time. Therefore we can draw two
major conclusions: first, simple network structures can perform no worse than
complicated ones for some cases; second, using a proper probabilistic
assumption is as equally, if not more, important as improving the complexity of
the network. Based on this observation, we propose a simple graph-based network
structure called GCHP, which utilizes only graph convolutional layers, thus it
can be easily accelerated by the parallel mechanism. We directly consider the
distribution of interarrival times instead of imposing a specific assumption on
the conditional intensity function, and propose to use a likelihood ratio loss
with a moment matching mechanism for optimization and model selection.
Experimental results show that GCHP can significantly reduce training time and
the likelihood ratio loss with interarrival time probability assumptions can
greatly improve the model performance.

work, we investigate matrix-free, linear-time approaches for estimating
Inverse-Hessian Vector Products (IHVPs) for the case when the Hessian can be
approximated as a sum of rank-one matrices, as in the classic approximation of
the Hessian by the empirical Fisher matrix. We propose two new algorithms as
part of a framework called M-FAC: the first algorithm is tailored towards
network compression and can compute the IHVP for dimension $d$, if the Hessian
is given as a sum of $m$ rank-one matrices, using $O(dm^2)$ precomputation,
$O(dm)$ cost for computing the IHVP, and query cost $O(m)$ for any single
element of the inverse Hessian. The second algorithm targets an optimization
setting, where we wish to compute the product between the inverse Hessian,
estimated over a sliding window of optimization steps, and a given gradient
direction, as required for preconditioned SGD. We give an algorithm with cost
$O(dm + m^2)$ for computing the IHVP and $O(dm + m^3)$ for adding or removing

state-of-the-art results for network pruning and optimization with lower

heterointerfaces. A notable example is the interface between polar and
non-polar materials, where valence discontinuities lead to otherwise
inaccessible charge and spin states. This approach paved the way to the
discovery of numerous unconventional properties absent in the bulk
constituents. However, control of the geometric structure of the electronic
wavefunctions in correlated oxides remains an open challenge. Here, we create
heterostructures consisting of ultrathin SrRuO$_3$, an itinerant ferromagnet
hosting momentum-space sources of Berry curvature, and LaAlO$_3$, a polar
wide-bandgap insulator. Transmission electron microscopy reveals an atomically
sharp LaO/RuO$_2$/SrO interface configuration, leading to excess charge being
pinned near the LaAlO$_3$/SrRuO$_3$ interface. We demonstrate through
magneto-optical characterization, theoretical calculations and transport
measurements that the real-space charge reconstruction modifies the
momentum-space Berry curvature in SrRuO$_3$, driving a reorganization of the
topological charges in the band structure. Our results illustrate how the
topological and magnetic features of oxides can be manipulated by engineering
charge discontinuities at oxide interfaces.

a real parameter $s$ that is directly related to the regularity of its Fourier
transform. Specifically, the Fourier transform of $u$ is $f\,d\sigma$, where
$d\sigma$ is the Hausdorff measure on the unit circle and the density $f$ is a
function on the circle that, roughly speaking, has exactly $s-\frac12$
derivatives in $L^2$ almost surely. When $s=0$, one recovers the classical
setting for random waves with a translation-invariant covariance-kernel. The
main thrust of this paper is to explore the connection between the regularity
parameter $s$ and the asymptotic behavior of the number $N(\nabla u,R)$ of
critical points that are contained in the disk of radius $R\gg1$. More
precisely, we show that the expectation $\mathbb{E}N(\nabla u,R)$ grows like
the area of the disk when the regularity is low enough ($s<\frac32$) and like
the diameter when the regularity is high enough ($s>\frac52$), and that the
corresponding exponent changes according to a linear interpolation law in the
intermediate regime. The transitions occurring at the endpoint cases involve
the square root of the logarithm of the radius. Interestingly, the highest
asymptotic growth rate occurs only in the classical translation-invariant
setting, $s=0$. A key step of the proof of this result is the obtention of
precise asymptotic expansions for certain Neumann series of Bessel functions.
When the regularity parameter is $s>5$, we show that in fact $N(\nabla u,R)$
grows like the diameter with probability 1, albeit the ratio is not a universal
constant but a random variable.

synaptogenesis in the brain, in which electrical stimulation in the brain
causes the formation of synapses from the cellular neural composites. The
strategy has been recently explored for neuromorphic engineering by
establishing link between the electrical signals and the dendrites' shapes.
Since the geometry of these structures determines their electrochemical
properties, understanding the mechanisms that regulate the polymer assembly
under electrically programmed conditions is an important aspect. In this
manuscript, we simulate this phenomenon using mesoscale simulations, taking
into account the important features of spatial-temporal potential mapping based
on the time-varying signal, the motion of charged particles in the liquid due
to the electric field, and the attachment of particles on the electrode. The
study helps in visualizing the motion of particles in different electrical
conditions, which is not possible to probe experimentally. Consistent with the
experiments, the higher AC frequency of electrical activities favors linear
wire-like growth, while lower frequency leads to more dense and fractal
dendrites growth, and voltage offset leads to asymmetrical growth. We find that
dendrites' shape and growth process systematically depend on particle
concentration and random scattering. We discover that the different dendrites'
architectures are associated with different Laplace and diffusion fields, which
govern the monomers trajectory and subsequent dendrites' growth. Such
unconventional engineering routes could have a variety of applications from
neuromorphic engineering to bottom-up computing strategies.

appendages (e.g. cilia and flagella) influence the emergence of swimming gaits,
synchronised bundles and metachronal waves. In this study, we address the issue
of HIs between slender filaments separated by a distance larger than their
contour length (d>L) by means of asymptotic calculations and numerical
simulations. We first derive analytical expressions for the extended resistance
matrix of two arbitrarily-shaped rigid filaments as a series expansion in
inverse powers of d/L>1. The coefficients in our asymptotic series expansion
are then evaluated using two well-established methods for slender filaments,
resistive-force theory (RFT) and slender-body theory (SBT), and our asymptotic
theory is verified using numerical simulations based on SBT for the case of two
parallel helices. The theory captures the qualitative features of the
interactions in the regime d/L>1, which opens the path to a deeper physical
understanding of hydrodynamically governed phenomena such as inter-filament
synchronisation and multiflagellar propulsion. To demonstrate the usefulness of
our results, we next apply our theory to the case of two helices rotating

for online action detection, which employs a long- and short-term memory
mechanism to model prolonged sequence data. It consists of an LSTR encoder that
dynamically leverages coarse-scale historical information from an extended
temporal window (e.g., 2048 frames spanning of up to 8 minutes), together with
an LSTR decoder that focuses on a short time window (e.g., 32 frames spanning 8
seconds) to model the fine-scale characteristics of the data. Compared to prior
work, LSTR provides an effective and efficient method to model long videos with
fewer heuristics, which is validated by extensive empirical analysis. LSTR
achieves state-of-the-art performance on three standard online action detection
benchmarks, THUMOS'14, TVSeries, and HACS Segment. Code has been made available

Einselection accounts for the emergence of preferred quasi-classical pointer

information acquired by the monitoring environment responsible for decoherence
is disseminated, in many copies, in the environment, and thus becomes
accessible to observers. This indirect nature of the acquisition of information
by observers who use the environment as a communication channel is the
mechanism through which objective classical reality emerges from the quantum

wide range of gas fractions ($3\%<f_g<94\%$). A Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov
Chain framework provides statistical constraints on the parameters used in
chemical evolution models. Nearly a million one-zone chemical and dust
evolution models were compared to 340 galaxies. Relative probabilities were
calculated from the $\chi^2$ between data and models, marginalised over the
different time steps, galaxy masses and star formation histories. We applied
this method to find `best fitting' model parameters related to metallicity, and
subsequently fix these metal parameters to study the dust parameters. For the
metal parameters, a degeneracy was found between the choice of initial mass
function, supernova metal yield tables and outflow prescription. For the dust
parameters, the uncertainties on the best fit values are often large except for
the fraction of metals available for grain growth, which is well constrained.
We find a number of degeneracies between the dust parameters, limiting our
ability to discriminate between chemical models using observations only. For
example, we show that the low dust content of low-metallicity galaxies can be
resolved by either reducing the supernova dust yields and/or including
photo-fragmentation. We also show that supernova dust dominates the dust mass
for low metallicity galaxies and grain growth dominates for high metallicity
galaxies. The transition occurs around $12+\log({\rm O/H})=7.75$, which is
lower than found in most studies in the literature.

massive elliptical (E)~galaxies suggest that their stars were formed in a very
short timescale which cannot be reconciled with estimates from stellar
population synthesis (SPS) studies and with hierarchical-assembly. Applying the
previously developed chemical evolution code, GalIMF, which allows an
environment-dependent stellar initial mass function (IMF) to be applied in the
integrated galaxy initial mass function (IGIMF) theory instead of an invariant
canonical IMF, the star formation timescales (SFT) of E galaxies are
re-evaluated. The code's uniqueness lies in it allowing the galaxy-wide IMF and
associated chemical enrichment to evolve as the physical conditions in the
galaxy change. The calculated SFTs become consistent with the independent SPS
results if the number of type Ia supernovae (SNIa) per unit stellar mass
increases for more massive E~galaxies. This is a natural outcome of galaxies
with higher star-formation rates producing more massive star clusters, spawning
a larger number of SNIa progenitors per star. The calculations show E~galaxies
with a stellar mass $\approx 10^{9.5} M_\odot$ to have had the longest mean
SFTs of $\approx2\,$Gyr. The bulk of more massive E~galaxies were formed faster
(SFT$\,\approx 1\,$Gyr) leading to domination by M~dwarf stars and larger
dynamical mass-to-light ratios as observed, while lower-mass galaxies tend to
lose their gas supply more easily due to their shallower potential and
therefore also have similarly-short mean SFTs. This work achieves, for the
first time, consistency of the SFTs for early-type galaxies between
chemical-enrichment and SPS modelling and leads to an improved understanding of
how the star formation environment may affect the total number of SNIa per unit
stellar mass formed.

Gauss law, independently of whether or not there is a non-gravitational bath.
In a theory with long-range gravity, the energy of an excitation localized to
the island can be detected from outside the island, in contradiction with the
principle that operators in an entanglement wedge should commute with operators
from its complement. In several known examples, we show that this tension is
resolved because islands appear in conjunction with a massive graviton. We also
derive some additional consistency conditions that must be obeyed by islands in
decoupled systems. Our arguments suggest that islands might not constitute
consistent entanglement wedges in standard theories of massless gravity where

and accretion induced collapse of massive white dwarfs in binary systems. We
consider two FRB emission mechanisms: First, we show that a
magnetically-powered source (e.g., a magnetar with field strength
$\gtrsim10^{14}\,$G) is viable for radio emission efficiencies
$\gtrsim10^{-4}$. This would require magnetic activity lifetimes longer than
the associated spin-down timescales and longer than empirically-constrained
lifetimes of Galactic magnetars. Alternatively, if these dynamical formation
channels produce young rotation-powered neutron stars with spin periods of
$\sim10\,$ms and magnetic fields of $\sim10^{11}\,$G (corresponding to
spin-down lifetimes of $\gtrsim10^5\,$yr), the inferred event rate and
energetics can be reasonably reproduced for order unity duty cycles.

binaries similar to those well-observed in Galactic globular clusters may also
be plausible channels, but only if their duty cycle for producing bursts

at those redshifts. The simulations span nearly three orders of magnitude in
gas-cell mass, from ~(7.7x10^6-1.5x10^4)Msun, one of the highest resolution
simulations of such a large patch of the inter-galactic medium (IGM) to date.
At z~5, a strong accretion shock develops around the main pancake following a
collision between two smaller sheets. Gas in the post-shock region proceeds to
cool rapidly, triggering thermal instabilities and the formation of a
multiphase medium. We find neither the mass, nor the morphology, nor the
distribution of HI in the WHIM to be converged at our highest resolution.
Interestingly, the lack of convergence is more severe for the less dense, more
metal-poor, intra-pancake medium (IPM) in between filaments and far from any
star-forming galaxies. As the resolution increases, the IPM develops a
shattered structure, with ~kpc scale clouds containing most of the HI. From our
lowest to highest resolution, the covering fraction of metal-poor
(Z<10^{-3}Zsun) Lyman-limit systems (NHI>10^{17.2}/cm^2) in the IPM at z~4
increases from (3-15)%, while that of Damped Lyman-alpha Absorbers
(NHI>10^{20}/cm^2) with similar metallicity increases threefold, from
(0.2-0.6)%, with no sign of convergence. We find that a necessary condition for
the formation of a multiphase, shattered structure is resolving the cooling
length, lcool=cs*tcool, at T~10^5K. If this scale is unresolved, gas ""piles up""
at these temperatures and cooling to lower temperatures becomes very
inefficient. We conclude that state-of-the-art cosmological simulations are
still unable to resolve the multi-phase structure of the low-density IGM, with
potentially far-reaching implications.

precisely because it is not trivial in the smaller space of fields -- one needs

near-infrared Hubble Space Telescope imaging using S\'ersic profile fitting and
compare them with a field sample. We find that the median $q$ of both
star-forming and quiescent galaxies in clusters increases with stellar mass,
similar to the field. Comparing the axis ratio distributions between clusters
and the field in four mass bins, the distributions for star-forming galaxies in
clusters are consistent with those in the field. Conversely, the distributions
for quiescent galaxies in the two environments are distinct, most remarkably in
$10.1\leq\log(M/{\rm M}_{\odot})<10.5$ where clusters show a flatter
distribution, with an excess at low $q$. Modelling the distribution with oblate
and triaxial components, we find that the cluster and field sample difference
is consistent with an excess of flattened oblate quiescent galaxies in
clusters. The oblate population contribution drops at high masses, resulting in
a narrower $q$ distribution in the massive population than at lower masses.
Using a simple accretion model, we show that the observed $q$ distributions and
quenched fractions are consistent with a scenario where no morphological
transformation occurs for the environmentally quenched population in the two

leads to the result that the inertial vacuum appears as a thermal state with

We construct an infinite family of nested Rindler-like coordinate systems $R_1,
R_2, ...$ within the right Rindler wedge, with time coordinates $\tau_1,
\tau_2, ...,$ and acceleration parameters $a_1, a_2, ...$ by shifting the
origin along the inertial $x$-axis by amounts $\ell_1, \ell_2,\cdots$. We show
that, apart from the inertial vacuum, the Rindler vacuum of the frame $R_n$
also appears to be a thermal state in the frame $R_{n+1}$ with the temperature
$a_{n+1}/2\pi$. In fact, the Rindler frame $R_{n+1}$ attributes to all the
Rindler vacuum states of $R_1, R_2, ... R_n$, as well as to the inertial vacuum
state, the same temperature $a_{n+1}/2\pi$. The frame with the shift $\ell$ and
the corresponding acceleration parameter $a(\ell)$ can be thought of as a
Rindler frame which is instantaneously comoving with the Einstein's elevator
moving with a variable acceleration. Our result suggests that the quantum
temperature associated with such an Einstein's elevator is the same as that
defined in the comoving Rindler frame. The shift parameters $\ell_j$ are
crucial for the inequivalent character of these vacua and encode the fact that
Rindler vacua are not invariant under spatial translation. We further show that
our result is discontinuous in an essential way in the coordinate shift
parameters. Similar structures can be introduced in the right wedge of any
spacetime with bifurcate Killing horizon, like, for e.g., Schwarzschild
spacetime. This has important implications for quantum gravity when flat
spacetime is treated as the ground state of quantum gravity.

for typical T Tauri disks. As a result, their current orbital locations require
an explanation beyond standard disk migration or in situ formation. Modern
theories of planet-disk interactions indicate that once a planet migrates close
to the disk's inner truncation radius, Type I torques vanish or switch
direction, depending on the stellar and disk conditions, so that the planet is
expected to stop its orbital decay and become trapped. In this work, we show
that that magnetically-driven sub-Keplerian gas flow in the inner disk can
naturally counteract these effects and produce systems with USP planets at
their observed orbital radii. The sub-Keplerian gas flow provides a headwind to
small planets, and the resulting torque can overcome the effects of outward
Type I migration near the co-rotation radius. For suitable disk and planet
parameters, the torques due to the sub-Keplerian gas flow lead to inward
migration on a rapid timescale. Over the time span of an FU Ori outburst, which
moves the disk truncation radius inward, the rapid headwind migration can place
planets in USP orbits. The combination of headwind migration and FU Ori
outbursts thus provides a plausible mechanism to move small planets from
$a=0.05-0.1$ AU down to $a=0.01-0.02$ AU. This effect is amplified for low-mass
planets, consistent with existing observations.

be important to optimize utilities not just for the end-user, but also for
other stakeholders such as item sellers or producers who desire a fair
representation of their items. This type of supplier fairness is sometimes
accomplished by attempting to increasing aggregate diversity in order to
mitigate popularity bias and to improve the coverage of long-tail items in
recommendations. In this paper, we introduce FairMatch, a general graph-based
algorithm that works as a post processing approach after recommendation
generation to improve exposure fairness for items and suppliers. The algorithm
iteratively adds high quality items that have low visibility or items from
suppliers with low exposure to the users' final recommendation lists. A
comprehensive set of experiments on two datasets and comparison with
state-of-the-art baselines show that FairMatch, while significantly improves
exposure fairness and aggregate diversity, maintains an acceptable level of
relevance of the recommendations.

which rare ""scarred"" eigenstates mediate weak ergodicity breaking. One open
question is to understand the most general setting in which these states arise.
In this work, we develop a generic construction that embeds a new class of
QMBS, rainbow scars, into the spectrum of an arbitrary Hamiltonian. Unlike
other examples of QMBS, rainbow scars display extensive bipartite entanglement
entropy while retaining a simple entanglement structure. Specifically, the
entanglement scaling is volume-law for a random bipartition, while scaling for
a fine-tuned bipartition is sub-extensive. When internal symmetries are
present, the construction leads to multiple, and even towers of rainbow scars
revealed through distinctive non-thermal dynamics. Remarkably, certain
symmetries can lead rainbow scars to arise in translation-invariant models. To
this end, we provide an experimental road map for realizing rainbow scar states
in a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator, leading to coherent oscillations distinct
from the strictly sub-volume-law QMBS previously realized in the same system.

  prospects for weak lensing applications","Submitted MNRAS. 12 pages, 7 figures (+ appendix)",,"10.1093/mnras/stab2585",,"astro-ph.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We present a detailed study of the shapes and alignments of different galaxy
cluster components using hydrodynamical simulations. We compute shape
parameters from the Dark Matter (DM) distribution, the galaxy members and the
intra-cluster light (ICL). We assess how well the DM cluster shape can be
constrained by means of the identified galaxy member positions and the ICL.
Further, we address the dilution factor introduced when estimating the cluster
elongation using weak-lensing stacking techniques, which arises due to the
misalignment between the total surface mass distribution and the distribution
of luminous tracers. The dilution is computed considering the alignment between
the DM and the Brightest Cluster Galaxy, the galaxy members and the ICL. Our
study shows that distributions of galaxy members and ICL are less spherical
than the DM component, although both are well aligned with the semi-major axis
of the later. We find that the distribution of galaxy members hosted in more
concentrated subhalos is more elongated than the distribution of the DM.
Moreover, these galaxies are better aligned with the dark matter component
compared to the distribution of galaxies hosted in less concentrated subhalos.
We conclude that the positions of galaxy members can be used as suitable
tracers to estimate the cluster surface density orientation, even when a low
number of members is considered. Our results provide useful information for
interpreting the constraints on the shapes of galaxy clusters in observational
studies.

experienced a transient epoch of matter domination due to the formation of a
large population of primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses $M \lesssim
10^{9}\,\textrm{g}$, that evaporate before Big Bang nucleosynthesis. In this
context, Hawking radiation would be a non-thermal mechanism to produce a cosmic
background of axion-like particles (ALPs). We assume the minimal scenario in
which these ALPs couple only with photons. In the case of ultralight ALPs ($m_a
\lesssim 10^{-9}\,\textrm{eV}$) the cosmic magnetic fields might trigger
ALP-photon conversions, while for masses $m_a \gtrsim 10\,\textrm{eV}$
spontaneous ALP decay in photon pairs would be effective. We investigate the
impact of these mechanisms on the cosmic X-ray background, on the excess in
X-ray luminosity in Galaxy Clusters, and on the process of cosmic reionization.

emergent order involves charge stripes, and our understanding of the
relationship between charge stripes and superconductivity has been evolving.
Here we review studies of 214 cuprate families obtained by doping
La$_2$CuO$_4$. Charge-stripe order tends to compete with bulk
superconductivity; nevertheless, there is plentiful evidence that it coexists
with two-dimensional superconductivity. This has been interpreted in terms of
pair-density-wave superconductivity, and the perspective has shifted from
competing to intertwined orders. In fact, a new picture of superconductivity
based on pairing within charge stripes has been proposed, as we discuss.

commonly used to stabilize complex fluids in multiple industries. However, the
ability to control the level of elastic modulus of these materials is limited
by the universality of the arrested spinodal decomposition mechanism that
governs their formation. We demonstrate that manipulating particle shape can
yield very large shifts in gel elasticity relative to this universal behavior,
and that these changes are generated by a set of independent mechanisms that
act multiplicatively. Modeling demonstrates that this efficient generation of
elasticity is the consequence of the combined effects of shape anisotropy on
the hierarchical fractal microstructure of the gel network, the anisotropy of
the attractive interparticle pair potentials, and the volumetric compactness of
the fractal cluster. The findings show how and why particle anisotropy can be
exploited to generate elasticity at ultra-low colloidal volume fractions in
this important class of soft matter.

  Classification",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Machine learning solutions for pattern classification problems are nowadays
widely deployed in society and industry. However, the lack of transparency and
accountability of most accurate models often hinders their safe use. Thus,
there is a clear need for developing explainable artificial intelligence
mechanisms. There exist model-agnostic methods that summarize feature
contributions, but their interpretability is limited to predictions made by
black-box models. An open challenge is to develop models that have intrinsic
interpretability and produce their own explanations, even for classes of models
that are traditionally considered black boxes like (recurrent) neural networks.
In this paper, we propose a Long-Term Cognitive Network for interpretable
pattern classification of structured data. Our method brings its own mechanism
for providing explanations by quantifying the relevance of each feature in the
decision process. For supporting the interpretability without affecting the
performance, the model incorporates more flexibility through a quasi-nonlinear
reasoning rule that allows controlling nonlinearity. Besides, we propose a
recurrence-aware decision model that evades the issues posed by the unique
fixed point while introducing a deterministic learning algorithm to compute the
tunable parameters. The simulations show that our interpretable model obtains
competitive results when compared to state-of-the-art white and black-box
models.

from paper I by probing the state space geometry of the Blume Emery Griffiths

field approximation. By accounting for the stochastic variables involved we
construct from the thermodynamic state space two complimentary two-dimensional
geometries with curvatures $R_m$ and $R_q$ which are shown to encode
correlations in the model's two order parameters, namely, the magnetization $m$
and the quadrupole moment $q$. The geometry is investigated in the zero as well
as the non zero magnetic field region. We find that the relevant scalar
curvatures diverge to negative infinity along the critical lines with the
correct scaling and amplitude. We then probe the geometry of phase coexistence
and find that the relevant curvatures predict the coexistence curve remarkably
well via their respective $R$-crossing diagrams. We also briefly comment on the
effectiveness of the geometric correlation length compared to the commonly used
Ornstein-Zernicke type correlation length vis-a-vis their scaling properties.

measure stellar mass functions in galaxy group-mass
($4.5-8\times10^{13}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$) haloes at $1<z<1.5$. Groups are
selected from COSMOS and SXDF, based on X-ray imaging and sparse spectroscopy.
Stellar mass ($M_{\mathrm{stellar}}$) functions are computed for quiescent and
star-forming galaxies separately, based on their rest-frame $UVJ$ colours. From
these we compute the quiescent fraction and quiescent fraction excess (QFE)
relative to the field as a function of $M_{\mathrm{stellar}}$. QFE increases
with $M_{\mathrm{stellar}}$, similar to more massive clusters at $1<z<1.5$.
This contrasts with the apparent separability of $M_{\mathrm{stellar}}$ and
environmental factors on galaxy quiescent fractions at $z\sim 0$. We then
compare our results with higher mass clusters at $1<z<1.5$ and lower redshifts.
We find a strong QFE dependence on halo mass at fixed $M_{\mathrm{stellar}}$;
well fit by a logarithmic slope of $\mathrm{d}(\mathrm{QFE})/\mathrm{d}\log
(M_{\mathrm{halo}}) \sim 0.24 \pm 0.04$ for all $M_{\mathrm{stellar}}$ and
redshift bins. This dependence is in remarkably good qualitative agreement with
the hydrodynamic simulation BAHAMAS, but contradicts the observed dependence of
QFE on $M_{\mathrm{stellar}}$. We interpret the results using two toy models:
one where a time delay until rapid (instantaneous) quenching begins upon
accretion to the main progenitor (""no pre-processing"") and one where it starts
upon first becoming a satellite (""pre-processing""). Delay times appear to be
halo mass dependent, with a significantly stronger dependence required without
pre-processing. We conclude that our results support models in which
environmental quenching begins in low-mass ($<10^{14}M_\odot$) haloes at $z>1$.

  Our approach reveals the full structure of the set of blowup-points at the

solution's first-order Cartesian coordinate partial derivatives blow up
precisely on the zero level set of a function that measures the inverse
foliation density of a family of characteristic hypersurfaces. Moreover,
relative to a set of geometric coordinates constructed out of an acoustic
eikonal function, the fluid solution and the inverse foliation density function
remain smooth up to the shock; the blowup of the solution's Cartesian
coordinate partial derivatives is caused by a degeneracy between the geometric
and Cartesian coordinates, signified by the vanishing of the inverse foliation
density (i.e., the intersection of the characteristics).

  actions with limiting boundaries between adjacent classes","32 pages, 5 tables",,,,"econ.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper addresses the general problem of designing ordinal classification
methods based on comparing actions with limiting boundaries of ordered classes
(categories). The fundamental requirement of the method consists of setting a
relational system (D,S), where S and D are reflexive and transitive relations,
respectively, S should be compatible with the order of the set of classes, and
D is a subset of S. An asymmetric preference relation P is defined from S.
Other requirements are imposed on the actions which compose the limiting
boundaries between adjacent classes, in such a way that each class is closed
below and above. The paper proposes S-based and P-based assignment procedures.
Each of them is composed of two complementary assignment procedures, which
correspond through the transposition operation and should be used conjointly.
The methods work under several basic conditions on the set of limiting
boundaries. Under other more demanding separability requirements, each
procedure fulfills the set of structural properties established for other
outranking-based ordinal classification methods. Our proposal avoids the
conflict between the required correspondence through the transposition
operation and the assignment of limiting actions to the classes to which they
belong. We thus propose very diverse S and P-based ordinal classification
approaches with desirable properties, which can be designed by using decision
models with the capacity to build preference relations fulfilling the basic
requirements to S and D.

strategies; on the other hand, optimizing with respect to costs may result in
poor patient outcomes. We propose a two-step approach for identifying an

develop a combined Q-learning and policy-search approach to estimate an optimal
list-based regime under a constraint on expected treatment costs. Second, we
propose an iterative procedure to select an optimally cost-effective regime
from a set of candidate regimes corresponding to different cost constraints.
Our approach can estimate optimal regimes in the presence of time-varying

illustrate the validity of estimated treatment regimes and examine operating
characteristics under flexible modeling approaches. We also apply our
methodology to evaluate optimally cost-effective treatment strategies for

it can occur to miss one or more sub-modalities for a given patient owing to
poor quality (e.g. imaging artifacts), failed acquisitions, or hallway
interrupted imaging examinations. In some cases, certain protocols are
unavailable due to limited scan time or to retrospectively harmonise the
imaging protocols of two independent studies. Missing image modalities pose a
challenge to segmentation frameworks as complementary information contributed
by the missing scans is then lost. In this paper, we propose a novel model,
Multi-modal Gaussian Process Prior Variational Autoencoder (MGP-VAE), to impute
one or more missing sub-modalities for a patient scan. MGP-VAE can leverage the
Gaussian Process (GP) prior on the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to utilize the
subjects/patients and sub-modalities correlations. Instead of designing one
network for each possible subset of present sub-modalities or using frameworks
to mix feature maps, missing data can be generated from a single model based on
all the available samples. We show the applicability of MGP-VAE on brain tumor
segmentation where either, two, or three of four sub-modalities may be missing.
Our experiments against competitive segmentation baselines with missing
sub-modality on BraTS'19 dataset indicate the effectiveness of the MGP-VAE

expected to provide compact, scalable and precise inertial sensing. However, a
rotation sensing device based on the Sagnac effect with atoms guided in a ring
has not yet been implemented despite continuous efforts during the last two
decades. Here we discuss some intrinsic effects that limit the coherence in
such a device and propose a scheme that overcomes these limitations and enables
a multi-pass guiding Sagnac interferometer with a Bose-Einstein condensate
(BEC) on a chip in a ring potential. We analyze crucial dephasing effects:
potential roughness, phase diffusion due to atom-atom interactions and number
uncertainty, and phase fluctuations. Owing to the recent progress in achieving
high momentum beam splitting, creating smooth guides, and manipulating the
matter-wavepacket propagation, guided interferometry can be implemented within
the coherence time allowed by phase diffusion. Despite the lower particle flux
in a guided Sagnac ring and the miniaturization of the interferometer, the
estimated sensitivity, for reasonable and practical realizations of an atom
chip-based gyroscope, is comparable to that of free-space interferometers,
reaching 45 nrads^{-1}Hz^{-1/2}. A significant improvement over
state-of-the-art free-space gyrocope sensitivities can be envisioned by using
thermal atoms instead of a BEC, whereby the interferometer can be operated in a
continuous fashion with the coherence limited by the scattering rate of the
atoms with the background gas. Taking into account the sensitivity times length
of the interferometer as the figure of merit which takes into account
compactness, our configuration is expected to deliver a potential improvement
of 2-4 orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art free-space gyroscopes for a
BEC, and 4-6 orders of magnitude for thermal atoms.

nearby equipment and dramatically increase the probability of a domino effect
with catastrophic results. Because of this, the characterization of such fire
accidents is important from a risk management point of view. One such
characterization would be the segmentation of different radiation zones within
the flame, so this paper presents an exploratory research regarding several
traditional computer vision and Deep Learning segmentation approaches to solve
this specific problem. A data set of propane jet fires is used to train and
evaluate the different approaches and given the difference in the distribution
of the zones and background of the images, different loss functions, that seek
to alleviate data imbalance, are also explored. Additionally, different metrics
are correlated to a manual ranking performed by experts to make an evaluation
that closely resembles the expert's criteria. The Hausdorff Distance and
Adjusted Random Index were the metrics with the highest correlation and the
best results were obtained from the UNet architecture with a Weighted
Cross-Entropy Loss. These results can be used in future research to extract
more geometric information from the segmentation masks or could even be
implemented on other types of fire accidents.

photometric and Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) photometric and astrometric
data. Structural parameters of the two clusters were derived, including the
physical sizes of Czernik 2 being r=5 and NGC 7654 as 8 min. We calculated
membership probabilities of stars based on their proper motion components as
released in the Gaia EDR3. To identify member stars of the clusters, we used
these membership probabilities taking into account location and the impact of
binarity on main-sequence stars. We used membership probabilities higher than
$P=0.5$ to identify 28 member stars for Czernik 2 and 369 for NGC 7654. We
estimated colour-excesses and metallicities separately using two-colour
diagrams to derive homogeneously determined parameters. The derived $E(B-V)$
colour excess is 0.46(0.02) mag for Czernik 2 and 0.57(0.04) mag for NGC 7654.
Metallicities were obtained for the first time for both clusters, -0.08(0.02)
dex for Czernik 2 and -0.05(0.01) dex for NGC 7654. Keeping the reddening and
metallicity as constant quantities, we fitted PARSEC models using
colour-magnitude diagrams, resulting in estimated distance moduli and ages of
the two clusters. We obtained the distance modulus for Czernik 2 as 12.80(0.07)
mag and for NGC 7654 as 13.20(0.16) mag, which coincide with ages of 1.2(0.2)
Gyr and 120(20) Myr, respectively. The distances to the clusters were
calculated using the Gaia EDR3 trigonometric parallaxes and compared with the
literature. We found good agreement between the distances obtained in this
study and the literature. Present day mass function slopes for both clusters
are comparable with the value of Salpeter (1955), being X=-1.37(0.24) for
Czernik 2 and X=-1.39(0.19) for NGC 7654.

from the VISTA Variables in the V\'ia L\'actea survey (VVV) and classified
based on their radial velocities and metallicities. We combine them with
another 20 CCs from the literature for which VVV photometry is available. The
compiled sample of CCs with homogeneously computed distances based on VVV
infrared photometry was employed as a proof of concept to trace the spiral
structure in the poorly explored far side of the disk. Although the use of CCs
has some caveats, these variables are currently the only available young
tracers in the far side disk for which a numerous sample with accurate
distances can be obtained. Therefore, a larger sample could allow us to make a
significant step forward in our understanding of the Milky Way disk as a whole.
We present preliminary evidence that CCs favor: a spiral arm model with two
main arms (Perseus and Scutum-Centaurus) branching out into four arms at
galactocentric distances, $R_\mathrm {GC}\gtrsim5-6\,\mathrm{kpc}$; the
extension of the Scutum-Centaurus arm behind the Galactic center; a possible
connection between the Perseus arm and the Norma tangency direction. The
current sample of CCs in the far side of the Galaxy are in the mid-plane,
arguing against the presence of a severely warped disk at small Galactocentric
distances ($R_\mathrm {GC}\lesssim12\,\mathrm{kpc}$) in the studied area. The
discovery and characterization of CCs at near-IR wavelengths appears to be a
promising tool to complement studies based on other spiral arm tracers and
extend them to the far side of our Galaxy.

under- and over-provisioning of VM instances with a precise estimation of VM
startup time, and in turn, it is likely to guarantee the application's
performance and improve the cost efficiency. However, VM startup time has been
little studied, and available measurement results performed previously did not
consider various configurations of VMs for modern cloud applications. In this
work, we perform comprehensive measurements and analysis of VM startup time
from two major cloud providers, namely Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google
Cloud Platform (GCP). With three months of measurements, we collected more than
300,000 data points from each provider by applying a set of configurations,
including 11+ VM types, four different data center locations, four VM image
sizes, two OS types, and two purchase models (e.g., spot/preemptible VMs vs.
on-demand VMs). With extensive analysis, we found that VM startup time can vary
significantly because of several important factors, such as VM image sizes,
data center locations, VM types, and OS types. Moreover, by comparing with
previous measurement results, we confirm that cloud providers (specifically
AWS) made significant improvements for the VM startup times and currently have
much quicker VM startup times than in the past.

scales, such as the too-big-to-fail problem, and core-cusp density profile of
dwarf galaxies. Such problems were argued to have a solution either in the
baryonic physics sector or in modifying the nature of dark matter to be
self-interacting, or self-annihilating, or ultra-light. Here we present a new
challenge for CDM by showing that two of Milky Way's satellites (Horologium I,
and Tucana II) are too dense, requiring the formation masses and redshifts of
halos in CDM not compatible with being a satellite. These
too-dense-to-be-satellite systems are dominated by dark matter and exhibit a
surface density above mean dark energy cosmic surface density
$\sim\Omega_{\Lambda} \rho_c c/H_0\approx 600~\rm M_{\odot}/pc^2$. This value
corresponds to dark matter pressure of $\approx 10^{-9}{\rm erg/cm^3}$. Along
with the recently reported excess in small-scale substructures found in
cluster-lenses, this problem, unlike other issues facing CDM, has no solution
in the baryonic sector and none of the current alternatives of dark matter can
account for it. The too-dense-to-be-satellite problem presented in this work
provides a new clue for the nature of dark matter, never accounted for before.
We note that Horologium I and Tucana II have only been discovered in the past
$\sim6$ years with DES, and future surveys (such as those done by Vera C. Rubin
Observatory) may uncover a broader population of such galaxies. Moreover, we
find that a number of MW's satellite require formation halo masses below the
atomic cooling limit which by itself is another challenging observation to
account for in CDM.

TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs): TOI-148, TOI-587, TOI-681, TOI-746, and
TOI-1213. Using TESS and ground-based photometry as well as radial velocities
from the CORALIE, CHIRON, TRES, and FEROS spectrographs, we found the
companions have orbital periods between 4.8 and 27.2 days, masses between 77
and 98 $\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$, and radii between 0.81 and 1.66 $\mathrm{R_{Jup}}$.
These targets have masses near the uncertain lower limit of hydrogen core
fusion ($\sim$73-96 $\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$), which separates brown dwarfs and
low-mass stars. We constrained young ages for TOI-587 (0.2 $\pm$ 0.1 Gyr) and
TOI-681 (0.17 $\pm$ 0.03 Gyr) and found them to have relatively larger radii
compared to other transiting companions of a similar mass. Conversely we
estimated older ages for TOI-148 and TOI-746 and found them to have relatively
smaller companion radii. With an effective temperature of 9800 $\pm$ 200 K,
TOI-587 is the hottest known main-sequence star to host a transiting brown
dwarf or very low-mass star. We found evidence of spin-orbit synchronization
for TOI-148 and TOI-746 as well as tidal circularization for TOI-148. These
companions add to the population of brown dwarfs and very low-mass stars with
well measured parameters ideal to test formation models of these rare objects,
the origin of the brown dwarf desert, and the distinction between brown dwarfs
and hydrogen-burning main sequence stars.

realization of the central role that data representation has in data processing
tasks, there is an obvious interest in notions of fair data representations.
The goal of such representations is that a model trained on data under the
representation (e.g., a classifier) will be guaranteed to respect some fairness
constraints.
  Such representations are useful when they can be fixed for training models on
various different tasks and also when they serve as data filtering between the
raw data (known to the representation designer) and potentially malicious
agents that use the data under the representation to learn predictive models
and make decisions.
  A long list of recent research papers strive to provide tools for achieving
these goals.
  However, we prove that this is basically a futile effort. Roughly stated, we
prove that no representation can guarantee the fairness of classifiers for
different tasks trained using it; even the basic goal of achieving
label-independent Demographic Parity fairness fails once the marginal data
distribution shifts. More refined notions of fairness, like Odds Equality,
cannot be guaranteed by a representation that does not take into account the
task specific labeling rule with respect to which such fairness will be
evaluated (even if the marginal data distribution is known a priory).
Furthermore, except for trivial cases, no representation can guarantee Odds
Equality fairness for any two different tasks, while allowing accurate label
predictions for both.
  While some of our conclusions are intuitive, we formulate (and prove) crisp
statements of such impossibilities, often contrasting impressions conveyed by
many recent works on fair representations.

a given graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, and a positive integer $f$, to
construct a data structure that, when queried with a set $F$ of $|F| \leq f$
edges, returns the diameter of $G-F$.
  For a single failure ($f=1$) in an unweighted directed graph of diameter $D$,
there exists an approximate FDO by Henzinger et al. [ITCS 2017] with stretch
$(1+\varepsilon)$, constant query time, space $O(m)$, and a combinatorial
preprocessing time of $\widetilde{O}(mn + n^{1.5} \sqrt{Dm/\varepsilon})$.We
present an FDO for directed graphs with the same stretch, query time, and
space. It has a preprocessing time of $\widetilde{O}(mn + n^2/\varepsilon)$.
The preprocessing time nearly matches a conditional lower bound for
combinatorial algorithms, also by Henzinger et al. With fast matrix
multiplication, we achieve a preprocessing time of $\widetilde{O}(n^{2.5794} +
n^2/\varepsilon)$. We further prove an information-theoretic lower bound
showing that any FDO with stretch better than $3/2$ requires $\Omega(m)$ bits
of space.
  For multiple failures ($f>1$) in undirected graphs with non-negative edge
weights, we give an $f$-FDO with stretch $(f+2)$, query time $O(f^2\log^2{n})$,
$\widetilde{O}(fn)$ space, and preprocessing time $\widetilde{O}(fm)$. We
complement this with a lower bound excluding any finite stretch in $o(fn)$
space. We show that for unweighted graphs with polylogarithmic diameter and up
to $f = o(\log n/ \log\log n)$ failures, one can swap approximation for query
time and space. We present an exact combinatorial $f$-FDO with preprocessing
time $mn^{1+o(1)}$, query time $n^{o(1)}$, and space $n^{2+o(1)}$. When using
fast matrix multiplication instead, the preprocessing time can be improved to
$n^{\omega+o(1)}$, where $\omega < 2.373$ is the matrix multiplication

in very metal-poor (VMP) halo stars might have different origins. By means of
familiar concepts from statistics (correlations, cluster analysis, rank tests
of elemental abundances), we look for causally correlated elemental abundance
patterns and attempt to link them to astrophysical events. Some of these events
produce the r-process elements jointly with iron, while others do not have any
significant iron contribution. In the early stage of our Galaxy, at least three
r-process nucleosynthesis sites have been active. The first two produce and
eject iron and the majority of the lighter r-process elements. We assign them
to two different types of core-collapse events, not identical to regular
core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), which produce only light trans-Fe elements.
The third category is characterized by a strong r-process and responsible for
the major fraction of the heavy main r-process elements without a significant
co-production of Fe. It does not appear to be connected to CCSNe, in fact the
Fe found in the related r-process enriched stars must come from previously
occurring CCSNe. The existence of actinide boost stars indicates a further
division among strong r-process sites. We assign these two strong r-process
sites to neutron star mergers without fast black hole formation and to events
where the ejecta are dominated by black hole accretion disk outflows.
Indications from the lowest-metallicity stars hint at a connection to massive
single stars (collapsars) forming black holes in the early Galaxy.

we first develop a cohesive framework of algorithmic decision-making adapted
for the public sector (ADMAPS) that reflects the complex socio-technical
interactions between \textit{human discretion}, \textit{bureaucratic
processes}, and \textit{algorithmic decision-making} by synthesizing disparate
bodies of work in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Science and
Technology Studies (STS), and Public Administration (PA). We then applied the
ADMAPS framework to conduct a qualitative analysis of an in-depth, eight-month
ethnographic case study of the algorithms in daily use within a child-welfare
agency that serves approximately 900 families and 1300 children in the
mid-western United States. Overall, we found there is a need to focus on
strength-based algorithmic outcomes centered in social ecological frameworks.
In addition, algorithmic systems need to support existing bureaucratic
processes and augment human discretion, rather than replace it. Finally,
collective buy-in in algorithmic systems requires trust in the target outcomes
at both the practitioner and bureaucratic levels. As a result of our study, we
propose guidelines for the design of high-stakes algorithmic decision-making
tools in the child-welfare system, and more generally, in the public sector. We
empirically validate the theoretically derived ADMAPS framework to demonstrate
how it can be useful for systematically making pragmatic decisions about the
design of algorithms for the public sector.

that such a VMD Ansatz might be reasonable for light vector-mesons. However,
when the vector-mesons are described by momentum-dependent bound-state

estimate either a photon-to-vector-meson transition strength or the momentum
dependence of those integrands that would arise in calculations of the
different reaction amplitudes. Consequently, for processes involving heavy

become a relevant source of revenue for stationary battery storage systems in
Germany. During this period, prices for FCR have decreased, while the market
has become increasingly flexible with shorter service periods and lower minimum
power requirements. This flexibility makes the market attractive for pools of
electric vehicles (EVs). Their idle times are now often longer than FCR service
periods, providing the opportunity to earn additional revenue. In this paper,
multi-year measurement data from 22 commercial EVs are used to develop a
simulation model for FCR commercialization. In addition, the driving logbooks
of more than 460 vehicles from different commercial fleets are analyzed. Based
on our simulations, the impact of FCR flexibilization on the economics of an EV
pool is analyzed using the German FCR market design from 2011 to 2020. It is
shown that depending on the fleet, especially the recent change in service
periods from one week to four hours generates the largest increase in available
pool power. Further reductions in FCR service periods will like produce minor
benefits, as idle times are often longer than service periods. Overall, the
increase in flexibility greatly offsets the decreasing FCR prices and leads to
higher revenues for most fleets analyzed. According to our model, revenues of
about 250 EUR/a to 400 EUR/a could have been achieved per EV in the German FCR
market in 2020.

South Polar Layered Deposit (SPLD) have sparked new speculation that liquid
water may be present below the ice cap. The reflections, discovered in data
acquired by the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding
(MARSIS) on board the Mars Express orbiter, were interpreted as reflections
from damp materials or even subsurface ponds and lakes similar to those found
beneath Earth's ice sheets. Recent studies, however, have questioned the
feasibility of melting and maintaining liquid water below the SPLD. Herein, we
compare radar simulations to MARSIS observations in order to present an
alternate hypothesis: that the bright reflections are the result of
interference between multiple layer boundaries, with no liquid water present.
This new interpretation is more consistent with known conditions on modern
Mars.

quantitative estimates for Faber-Krahn inequalities on simply connected space
forms. We prove that the gap between the first eigenvalue of a given set
$\Omega$ and that of the ball quantitatively controls both the $L^1$ distance
of this set from a ball {\it and} the $L^2$ distance between the corresponding
eigenfunctions: \[ \lambda_1(\Omega) - \lambda_1(B) \gtrsim |\Omega \Delta B|^2
+ \int |u_{\Omega} - u_B|^2, \] where $B$ denotes the nearest geodesic ball to
$\Omega$ with $|B|=|\Omega|$ and $u_\Omega$ denotes the first eigenfunction
with suitable normalization. On Euclidean space, this extends a result of
Brasco-De Phillipis-Velichkov; the eigenfunction control largely builds upon
new regularity results for minimizers of critically perturbed Alt-Cafarelli
type functionals in our companion paper. On the round sphere and hyperbolic
space, the present results are the first sharp quantitative results with
respect to any distance; here the local portion of the analysis is based on new
implicit spectral analysis techniques.
  Second, we apply these sharp quantitative Faber-Krahn inequalities in order
to establish a quantitative form of the Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman (ACF)
monotonicity formula. We show that the energy drop in the ACF monotonicity
formula from one scale to the next controls how close a pair of admissible
functions is from a pair of complementary half-plane solutions. In particular,
when the square root of the energy drop summed over all scales is small, our
result implies the existence of tangents (unique blowups) of these functions.

unclear what contributes to the effectiveness of such online peer production
systems: what conditions or social processes help them deliver quality

often investigated in online collaboration, the role of interpersonal
communication in coordination of online peer-production is much less
investigated. To address this gap we have reconstructed networks of personal
communication (direct messaging) between Wikipedia editors gathered in so
called Wikiprojects - teams of contributors who focus on articles within
specific topical areas. We found that effective projects exchange larger volume
of direct messages and that their communication structure allows for complex
coordination: for sharing of information locally through selective ties, and at
the same time globally across the whole group. To verify how these network
measures relate to the subjective perception of importance of group
communication we conducted semi-structured interviews with members of selected
projects. Our interviewees used direct communication for providing feedback,
for maintaining close relations and for tapping on the social capital of the
Wikipedia community. Our results underscore the importance of communication
structure in online collaboration: online peer production communities rely on
interpersonal communication to coordinate their work and to maintain high
levels of engagement. Design of platforms for such communities should allow for
ample group level communication as well as for one-on-one interactions.

setting of a linear combination $s(t)B+(1-s(t))C$ of two noncommuting
Hamiltonians $B$ and $C$. This includes both quantum annealing (QA) and the
quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). The target is to minimize
the energy of the final ``problem'' Hamiltonian $C$, for a time-dependent and
bounded control schedule $s(t)\in [0,1]$ and $t\in \mc{I}:= [0,t_f]$. It was
recently shown, in a purely closed system setting, that the optimal solution to
this problem is a ``bang-anneal-bang'' schedule, with the bangs characterized
by $s(t)= 0$ and $s(t)= 1$ in finite subintervals of $\mc{I}$, in particular
$s(0)=0$ and $s(t_f)=1$, in contrast to the standard prescription $s(0)=1$ and
$s(t_f)=0$ of quantum annealing. Here we extend this result to the open system
setting, where the system is described by a density matrix rather than a pure
state. This is the natural setting for experimental realizations of QA and
QAOA. For finite-dimensional environments and without any approximations we
identify sufficient conditions ensuring that either the bang-anneal,
anneal-bang, or bang-anneal-bang schedules are optimal, and recover the
optimality of $s(0)=0$ and $s(t_f)=1$. However, for infinite-dimensional
environments and a system described by an adiabatic Redfield master equation we
do not recover the bang-type optimal solution. In fact we can only identify
conditions under which $s(t_f)=1$, and even this result is not recovered in the
fully Markovian limit. The analysis, which we carry out entirely within the
geometric framework of Pontryagin Maximum Principle, simplifies using the
density matrix formulation compared to the state vector formulation.

presence of a particle will disturb a background viscosity field and the
disturbance generated depends on the boundary conditions imposed by the
particle on the viscosity field. We find that, irrespective of the details of
the disturbance, active squirmer-type particle tend to align down viscosity
gradients (negative viscotaxis). However, the rate of rotation and the swimming
speed along the gradient do depend on the details of the interaction of the
particle and the background viscosity field. In addition, we explore the
relative importance on the dynamics of the local viscosity changes on the
surface of active particles versus the (nonlocal) changes in the flow field due
to spatially varying viscosity (from that of a homogeneous fluid). We show that
the relative importance of local versus nonlocal effects depends crucially on
the boundary conditions imposed by the particle on the field. This work
demonstrates the dangers in neglecting the disturbance of the background
viscosity caused by the particle as well as in using the local effects alone to
capture the particle motion.

the first scenario, local models are trained at the IoT devices and the F-APs
upload the local model parameters to the CS. In the second scenario, local
models are trained at the F-APs based on the collected data from the IoT
devices and the F-APs collaborate with the CS for updating the model
parameters. Our objective is to minimize the overall energy-consumption of both
scenarios subject to FL time constraint. Towards this goal, we devise a joint
optimization of scheduling of IoT devices with the F-APs, transmit power
allocation, computation frequency allocation at the devices and F-APs and
decouple it into two subproblems. In the first subproblem, we optimize the IoT
device scheduling and power allocation, while in the second subproblem, we
optimize the computation frequency allocation. For each scenario, we develop a
conflict graph based solution to iteratively solve the two subproblems.
Simulation results show that the proposed two schemes achieve a considerable
performance gain in terms of the energy consumption minimization. The presented
simulation results interestingly reveal that for a large number of IoT devices
and large data sizes, it is more energy efficient to train the local models at
the IoT devices instead of the F-APs.

simulated results showed that the initial spatial asymmetry depends on the

final momentum asymmetry is similar to the initial momentum asymmetry.
Furthermore, the averaged transverse shape asymmetry, which includes the
initial spatial asymmetry, the initial momentum asymmetry, and the final
momentum asymmetry, is significantly dependent on the transverse momentum and
particle species identity (PID). The PID scales ordering transverse asymmetry

for interpreting solar activities and dynamo. In this research, we investigated
the asymmetric distribution of the solar photospheric magnetic field values,
using synoptic charts constructed from space-borne high-resolution
magnetograms. It is demonstrated that the Lorentzian function describes the
distribution of magnetic field values in the synoptic charts much better than
the Gaussian function, and this should reflect the gradual decay process from
strong to weak magnetic fields. The asymmetry values are calculated under
several circumstances, and the results generally show two periodicities related
to the variation of the solar B$_0$ angle and the solar cycle, respectively. We
argue that it is the small-scale magnetic fields, the inclination of the solar
axis, the emergence and evolution of magnetic flux, and the polar fields that
are responsible for the features of asymmetry values. We further determined the
polar field reversal time of solar cycles 23 and 24 with the flip of asymmetry
values. Specifically, for cycle 24, we assert that the polar polarities of both
hemispheres reversed at the same time - in March 2014; as to cycle 23, the
reversal time of the S-hemisphere is March 2001, while the determination of the

simulations is the spectral boundary integral element method (sBIEM), which
takes advantage of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to make a complex numerical
dynamic rupture tractable. However, this method has the serious drawback of
requiring a flat fault geometry due to the FFT approach. Here we present an
analytical formulation that extends the sBIEM to a mildly non-planar fault. We
start from a regularized boundary element method and apply a small-slope
approximation of the fault geometry. Making this assumption, it is possible to
show that the main effect of non-planar fault geometry is to change the normal
traction along the fault, which is controlled by the local curvature along the
fault. We then convert this space--time boundary integral equation of the
normal traction into a spectral-time formulation and incorporate this change in
normal traction into the existing sBIEM methodology. This approach allows us to
model fully dynamic seismic cycle simulations on non-planar faults in a
particularly efficient way. We then test this method against a regular boundary
integral element method for both rough-fault and seamount fault geometries, and
demonstrate that this sBIEM maintains the scaling between the fault geometry
and slip distribution.

which wraps around as a physical spiral across the $x$--$y$ plane
(""snails-in-space""). We explore the connection between these local and global
spirals through the example of a satellite perturbing a test-particle Milky Way
(MW)-like disk. We anticipate our results to broadly apply to any vertical
perturbation.
  Using a $z$--$v_z$ asymmetry metric we demonstrate that in test-particle
simulations: (a) multiple local phase-spiral morphologies appear when stars are
binned by azimuthal action $J_\phi$, excited by a single event (in our case, a
satellite disk-crossing); (b) these distinct phase-spirals are traced back to
distinct disk locations; and (c) they are excited at distinct times. Thus,
local phase-spirals offer a global view of the MW's perturbation history from
multiple perspectives.
  Using a toy model for a Sagittarius (Sgr)-like satellite crossing the disk,
we show that the full interaction takes place on timescales comparable to
orbital periods of disk stars within $R \lesssim 10$ kpc. Hence such
perturbations have widespread influence which peaks in distinct regions of the
disk at different times.
  This leads us to examine the ongoing MW-Sgr interaction. While Sgr has not
yet crossed the disk (currently, $z_{Sgr} \approx -6$ kpc, $v_{z,Sgr} \approx
210$ km/s), we demonstrate that the peak of the impact has already passed.
Sgr's pull over the past 150 Myr creates a global $v_z$ signature with
amplitude $\propto M_{Sgr}$, which might be detectable in future spectroscopic

recommend the next item of an anonymous short item sequence (i.e., session).
Unlike sequence-aware recommender systems where the whole interaction sequence
of each user can be used to model both the short-term interest and the general
interest of the user, the absence of user-dependent information in SRSs makes
it difficult to directly derive the user's general interest from data.
Therefore, existing SRSs have focused on how to effectively model the
information about short-term interest within the sessions, but they are
insufficient to capture the general interest of users. To this end, we propose
a novel framework to overcome the limitation of SRSs, named ProxySR, which
imitates the missing information in SRSs (i.e., general interest of users) by
modeling proxies of sessions. ProxySR selects a proxy for the input session in
an unsupervised manner, and combines it with the encoded short-term interest of
the session. As a proxy is jointly learned with the short-term interest and
selected by multiple sessions, a proxy learns to play the role of the general
interest of a user and ProxySR learns how to select a suitable proxy for an
input session. Moreover, we propose another real-world situation of SRSs where
a few users are logged-in and leave their identifiers in sessions, and a
revision of ProxySR for the situation. Our experiments on real-world datasets
show that ProxySR considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors,

Previous studies have shown that mass transfer stability and common envelope
evolution can significantly affect the formation of merging BH--CS binaries
through isolated binary evolution. With detailed binary evolution simulations,
we obtain easy-to-use criteria for the occurrence of the common envelope phase
in mass-transferring BH binaries with a nondegenerate donor, and incorporate
into population synthesis calculations. To explore the impact of possible mass
gap between NSs and BHs on the properties of merging BH--CS binary population,
we adopt different supernova mechanisms involving the \textit{rapid},
\textit{delayed} and \textit{stochastic} prescriptions to deal with the compact
remnant masses and the natal kicks. Our calculations show that there are $ \sim
10^{5} -10^{6}$ BH--CS binaries in the Milky Way, among which dozens are
observable by future space-based gravitational wave detectors. We estimate that
the local merger rate density of all BH--CS systems is $ \sim 60-200 \,\rm
Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$. While there are no low-mass BHs formed via \textit{rapid}
supernovae, both \textit{delayed} and \textit{stochastic} prescriptions predict
that $ \sim 100\% $/$ \sim 70\% $/$ \sim 30\% $ of merging BH--WD/BH--NS/BH--BH

approach to data-race detection is via dynamic analyses, which work over
executions of concurrent programs, instead of the program source code. The rich
literature on the topic has created various notions of dynamic data races,
which are known to be detected efficiently when certain parameters (e.g.,
number of threads) are small. However, the \emph{fine-grained} complexity of
all these notions of races has remained elusive, making it impossible to
characterize their trade-offs between precision and efficiency.
  In this work we establish several fine-grained separations between many
popular notions of dynamic data races. The input is an execution trace with $N$
events, $T$ threads and $L$ locks. Our main results are as follows. First, we
show that happens-before (HB) races can be detected in $O(N\cdot \min(T, L))$
time, improving over the standard $O(N\cdot T)$ bound when $L=o(T)$. Moreover,
we show that even reporting an HB race that involves a read access is hard for
2-orthogonal vectors (2-OV). This is the first rigorous proof of the
conjectured quadratic lower-bound in detecting HB races. Second, we show that
the recently introduced synchronization-preserving races are hard to detect for
OV-3 and thus have a cubic lower bound, when $T=\Omega(N)$. This establishes a
complexity separation from HB races which are known to be less expressive.
Third, we show that lock-cover races are hard for 2-OV, and thus have a
quadratic lower-bound, even when $T=2$ and $L = \omega(\log N)$. The similar
notion of lock-set races is known to be detectable in $O(N\cdot L)$ time, and
thus we achieve a complexity separation between the two. Moreover, we show that
lock-set races become hitting-set (HS)-hard when $L=\Theta(N)$, and thus also
have a quadratic lower bound, when the input is sufficiently complex.

A temporal interaction network consists of a series of chronological
interactions between users and items. Previous methods tackle this problem by
using different variants of recurrent neural networks to model sequential
interactions, which fail to consider the structural information of temporal
interaction networks and inevitably lead to sub-optimal results. To this end,
we propose a novel Deep Structural Point Process termed as DSPP for learning
temporal interaction networks. DSPP simultaneously incorporates the topological
structure and long-range dependency structure into our intensity function to
enhance model expressiveness. To be specific, by using the topological
structure as a strong prior, we first design a topological fusion encoder to
obtain node embeddings. An attentive shift encoder is then developed to learn
the long-range dependency structure between users and items in continuous time.
The proposed two modules enable our model to capture the user-item correlation
and dynamic influence in temporal interaction networks. DSPP is evaluated on
three real-world datasets for both tasks of item prediction and time
prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
consistent and significant improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.

current approaches in actual scenarios because people can't know how to
interact with the machine without the evaluation of prediction, and unreliable
predictions may mislead the machine to harm the human. Hence, we propose an
uncertainty-aware framework for human motion prediction (UA-HMP). Concretely,
we first design an uncertainty-aware predictor through Gaussian modeling to
achieve the value and the uncertainty of predicted motion. Then, an
uncertainty-guided learning scheme is proposed to quantitate the uncertainty
and reduce the negative effect of the noisy samples during optimization for
better performance. Our proposed framework is easily combined with current SOTA
baselines to overcome their weakness in uncertainty modeling with slight
parameters increment. Extensive experiments also show that they can achieve
better performance in both short and long-term predictions in H3.6M, CMU-Mocap.

relatively difficult for such models, given that their flexibility implies that
the consequences of prior choices are often relatively opaque. Moreover, these
choices can have a substantial effect on posterior inferences. Thus,
considerations of robustness need to go hand in hand with nonparametric
modeling. In the current paper, we tackle this challenge by exploiting the fact
that variational Bayesian methods, in addition to having computational
advantages in fitting complex nonparametric models, also yield sensitivities
with respect to parametric and nonparametric aspects of Bayesian models. In

breakdown, the dependence curve of wall velocity on external in-plane bias
field takes parabolic shape around the compensation point where the total

While deep learning methods have made significant progress for the VHPE, most
approaches to this task implicitly model the long-range interaction between
joints by enlarging the receptive field of the convolution. Unlike prior
methods, we design a lightweight and plug-and-play joint relation extractor
(JRE) to model the associative relationship between joints explicitly and
automatically. The JRE takes the pseudo heatmaps of joints as input and
calculates the similarity between pseudo heatmaps. In this way, the JRE
flexibly learns the relationship between any two joints, allowing it to learn
the rich spatial configuration of human poses. Moreover, the JRE can infer
invisible joints according to the relationship between joints, which is
beneficial for the model to locate occluded joints. Then, combined with
temporal semantic continuity modeling, we propose a Relation-based Pose
Semantics Transfer Network (RPSTN) for video-based human pose estimation.
Specifically, to capture the temporal dynamics of poses, the pose semantic
information of the current frame is transferred to the next with a joint
relation guided pose semantics propagator (JRPSP). The proposed model can
transfer the pose semantic features from the non-occluded frame to the occluded
frame, making our method robust to the occlusion. Furthermore, the proposed JRE
module is also suitable for image-based human pose estimation. The proposed
RPSTN achieves state-of-the-art results on the video-based Penn Action dataset,
Sub-JHMDB dataset, and PoseTrack2018 dataset. Moreover, the proposed JRE
improves the performance of backbones on the image-based COCO2017 dataset. Code

integrated luminosity of 19.3 fb$^{-1}$ $e^+e^-$ annihilation data accumulated
with the BESIII detector at BEPCII. We observe for the first time
$e^+e^-\to\gamma \chi_{c1,c2}$ signals at $\sqrt{s}=$ 4.180 GeV with
statistical significances of 7.6$\sigma$ and 6.0$\sigma$, respectively. The
production cross section of $e^+e^-\to\gamma \chi_{c1,c2}$ at each

$e^+e^-\to\gamma \chi_{c1}$ cross section can be described with conventional
charmonium states $\psi(3686)$, $\psi(3770)$, $\psi(4040)$, $\psi(4160)$.
Compared with this, for the $e^+e^-\to\gamma \chi_{c2}$ channel, one more
additional resonance is added to describe the cross section line shape. Its
mass and width are measured to be $M=4371.7\pm7.5\pm1.8$ MeV/$c^2$ and
$\Gamma^{tot}=51.1\pm17.6\pm1.9$ MeV, where the first uncertainties are
statistical and the second systematic. The significance of this resonance is
estimated to be 5.8$\sigma$, and its parameters agree with the $Y(4360)$
resonance previously reported in $e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-\psi(3686)$, and the
$Y(4390)$ in $e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-h_c$ within uncertainties. No significant
signal for the $e^+e^-\to\gamma \chi_{c0}$ process is observed, and the upper
limits of Born cross sections $\sigma_{B}(e^+e^-\to\gamma \chi_{c0})$ at 90\%

(PNC) to Industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) where a controller and a robot
are out of each other's transmission range, and they exchange messages with the
assistance of a relay. We particularly focus on a scenario where the controller
has more transmitted information, and the channel of the controller is stronger
than that of the robot. To reduce the communication latency, we propose an
asymmetric transmission scheme where the controller and robot transmit
different amount of information in the uplink of PNC simultaneously. To achieve
this, the controller chooses a higher order modulation. In addition, the both
users apply channel codes to guarantee the reliability. A problem is a
superimposed symbol at the relay contains different amount of source
information from the two end users. It is thus hard for the relay to deduce
meaningful network-coded messages by applying the current PNC decoding
techniques which require the end users to transmit the same amount of
information. To solve this problem, we propose a lattice-based scheme where the
two users encode-and-modulate their information in lattices with different
lattice construction levels. Our design is versatile on that the two end users
can freely choose their modulation orders based on their channel power, and the
design is applicable for arbitrary channel codes.

framework, dynamic objects not captured in the 3D environment map are
instantiated based on the input images. Finally, a scene rendering component
synthesizes a first-person view with identification (ID) textures and performs
direct 2D-3D gaze association. Quantitative evaluations showed the

strong pulsation and co-related X-ray intensity variation in SXT (0.5--8.0 keV)
and LAXPC (3--60 keV) energy bands. Spin-period and spin-down rate of the
pulsar were determined from two observations as $65.35080\pm0.00014$ s ,

gastrointestinal endoscopy. Videos given by endoscopy bring both richer
contextual information as well as more challenges than still images. The
camera-moving situation, instead of the common camera-fixed-object-moving one,
leads to significant background variation between frames. Severe internal
artifacts (e.g. water flow in the human body, specular reflection by tissues)
can make the quality of adjacent frames vary considerately. These factors
hinder a video-based model to effectively aggregate features from neighborhood
frames and give better predictions. In this paper, we present Spatial-Temporal
Feature Transformation (STFT), a multi-frame collaborative framework to address
these issues. Spatially, STFT mitigates inter-frame variations in the
camera-moving situation with feature alignment by proposal-guided deformable
convolutions. Temporally, STFT proposes a channel-aware attention module to
simultaneously estimate the quality and correlation of adjacent frames for
adaptive feature aggregation. Empirical studies and superior results
demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of our method. For example, STFT
improves the still image baseline FCOS by 10.6% and 20.6% on the comprehensive
F1-score of the polyp localization task in CVC-Clinic and ASUMayo datasets,
respectively, and outperforms the state-of-the-art video-based method by 3.6%

many applications in the fields of robot learning and autonomous driving. This
paper reveals novel geometric laws of optical flow based on the insight and
detailed definition of non-occlusion. Then, two novel loss functions are
proposed for the unsupervised learning of optical flow based on the geometric
laws of non-occlusion. Specifically, after the occlusion part of the images are
masked, the flowing process of pixels is carefully considered and geometric
constraints are conducted based on the geometric laws of optical flow. First,
neighboring pixels in the first frame will not intersect during the pixel
displacement to the second frame. Secondly, when the cluster containing
adjacent four pixels in the first frame moves to the second frame, no other
pixels will flow into the quadrilateral formed by them. According to the two
geometrical constraints, the optical flow non-intersection loss and the optical
flow non-blocking loss in the non-occlusion regions are proposed. Two loss
functions punish the irregular and inexact optical flows in the non-occlusion
regions. The experiments on datasets demonstrated that the proposed
unsupervised losses of optical flow based on the geometric laws in
non-occlusion regions make the estimated optical flow more refined in detail,
and improve the performance of unsupervised learning of optical flow. In
addition, the experiments training on synthetic data and evaluating on real
data show that the generalization ability of optical flow network is improved
by our proposed unsupervised approach.

longitude awards offered by the leading European maritime nations attracted
applicants from far and wide, often accompanied by extensive, self-published

similar hype. The alleged existence of seventeenth-century Venetian award is
particularly curious, because the city's fortune was clearly in decline, and
longitude determination on the open seas does not appear to have been a
priority; the city's mariners already had access to excellent ""portolan""

establishment of a number of longitude awards by private donors. The first
private British award was bequeathed in 1691 by Thomas Axe, parish clerk of
Ottery St. Mary (Devon). Despite the absence of an expenses component and the
onerous and costly nature of its terms and conditions, the Axe prize attracted
a number of optimistic claimants. Although the award was never disbursed, it
may have contributed to the instigation of the government-supported monetary
reward associated with the British Longitude Act of 1714. It is likely that the
conditions governing the British ""Longitude Prize"", specifically the required
accuracy and the need for sea trials and of disclosure of a successful method's

under manufacturing inaccuracies, the robust or three-field formulation is
employed, involving dilated, intermediate and eroded realizations of the
design. Darcy's law in conjunction with a conceptualized drainage term is used
to model the pressure load as a function of the design vector. The consistent
nodal loads are evaluated from the obtained pressure field using the standard
finite element method. The objective and load sensitivities are obtained using
the adjoint-variable approach. A multi-criteria objective involving both the
stiffness and flexibility of the mechanism is employed in the robust
formulation, and min-max optimization problems are solved to obtain
pressure-actuated inverter, gripper, and contractor compliant mechanisms with
different minimum feature sizes. Limitations of the linear elasticity
assumptions while designing mechanisms are identified with high pressure loads.
Challenges involved in designing finite deformable pressure-actuated compliant
mechanisms are presented.

behaviours and interactions of autonomous agents. As Agent Based Models are
usually representative of complex systems, obtaining a likelihood function of
the model parameters is nearly always intractable. There is a necessity to
conduct inference in a likelihood free context in order to understand the model
output. Approximate Bayesian Computation is a suitable approach for this
inference. It can be applied to an Agent Based Model to both validate the
simulation and infer a set of parameters to describe the model. Recent research

sample data values used to be predicted are the only correct ones. This
assumption does not hold for laboratory test data. Test results are often
within tolerable or imprecision ranges, with all values in the ranges
acceptable. By considering imprecision samples, we propose an imprecision range
loss (IR loss) method and incorporate it into Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
model for disease progress prediction. In this method, each sample in
imprecision range space has a certain probability to be the real value,
participating in the loss calculation. The loss is defined as the integral of
the error of each point in the impression range space. A sampling method for
imprecision space is formulated. The continuous imprecision space is
discretized, and a sequence of imprecise data sets are obtained, which is
convenient for gradient descent learning. A heuristic learning algorithm is
developed to learn the model parameters based on the imprecise data sets.
Experimental results on real data show that the prediction method based on IR
loss can provide more stable and consistent prediction result when test samples
are generated from imprecision range.

Geant4 provides an estimate of detector response (sensitivity) based on an
accurate description of detector geometry, material composition and interaction
of particles with the various detector layers. The MC simulated hit rate is
estimated as a function of the perpendicular distance from the beam line and

periodically in time in the quadrature space. We investigate the effects of
wave nonstaticity arisen in a static environment on the behavior of

phases appear only when the measure of nonstaticity is not zero and their time
behavior is deeply related to the measure of nonstaticity. While the dynamical
phases undergo linear decrease over time, the geometric phases exhibit somewhat
oscillatory behavior where the center of oscillation linearly increases. In
particular, if the measure of nonstaticity is sufficiently high, the geometric

due to the finite size of grains. We solve the Nonlocal Granular Fluidity (NGF)
continuum model in quasi-2D silo geometries and evaluate its ability to predict
these nonlocal effects, including flow spreading and, importantly, clogging
(arrest) when the opening is small enough. The model is augmented to include a
free-separation criterion and is implemented numerically with an extension of
the trans-phase granular flow solver described in arXiv:1411.5447, to produce
full-field solutions. The implementation is validated against analytical
results of the model in the inclined chute geometry, such as the solution for
the $H_{\mathrm{stop}}$ curve for size-dependent flow arrest, and the velocity
profile as a function of layer height. We then implement the model in the silo
geometry and vary the apparent grain size. The model predicts a jamming
criterion when the opening competes with the scale of the mean grain size,
which agrees with previous experimental studies, marking the first time to our
knowledge that silo jamming has been achieved with a continuum model. For
larger openings, the flow within the silo obtains a diffusive characteristic
whose spread depends on the model's nonlocal amplitude and the mean grain size.
The numerical tests are controlled for grid effects and a comparison study of
coarse vs refined numerical simulations shows agreement in the pressure field,
the shape of the arch in a jammed silo configuration, and the velocity field in
a flowing configuration.

points forming a lattice grid. This technique is particularly useful for
computationally difficult problems such as quantum many-body systems. For
reasons of simplicity and familiarity, nearly all quantum many-body
calculations have been performed on simple cubic lattices. Since the removal of
lattice artifacts is often an important concern, it would be useful to perform
calculations using more than one lattice geometry. In this work we show how to
perform quantum many-body calculations using auxiliary-field Monte Carlo
simulations on a three-dimensional body-centered cubic (BCC) lattice. As a
benchmark test we compute the ground state energy of 33 spin-up and 33
spin-down fermions in the unitary limit, which is an idealized limit where the
interaction range is zero and scattering length is infinite. As a fraction of
the free Fermi gas energy $E_{\rm FG}$, we find that the ground state energy is
$E_0/E_{\rm FG}= 0.369(2), 0.371(2),$ using two different definitions of the
finite-system energy ratio. This is in excellent agreement with recent results
obtained on a cubic lattice \cite{He:2019ipt}. We find that the computational
effort and performance on a BCC lattice is approximately the same as that for a
cubic lattice with the same number of lattice points. We discuss how the
lattice simulations with different geometries can be used to constrain the size
lattice artifacts in simulations of continuum quantum many-body systems.

multi-peak solitons and the ranges of the degree of nonlocality within which
the solitons exist are analytically obtained by the variational approach. This
is the first time, to our knowledge at least, to discuss the solution existence
range of the multi-peak solitons analytically, although approximately. The
variational analytical results are confirmed by the numerical ones. The
stability of the multi-peak solitons are addressed by the linear stability

  Combinatorial Optimisation Problems",,,,,"quant-ph cs.ET","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The intractability of deterministic solutions in solving $\mathcal{NP}$-Hard
Combinatorial Optimisation Problems (COP) is well reported in the literature.
One mechanism for overcoming this difficulty has been the use of efficient COP
non-deterministic approaches. However, with the advent of quantum technology,
these modern devices' potential to overcome this tractability limitation
requires exploration. This paper juxtaposes classical and quantum optimisation
algorithms' performance to solve two common COP, the Travelling Salesman
Problem (TSP) and the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP). Two accepted
classical optimisation methods, Branch and Bound (BNB) and Simulated Annealing
(SA), are compared to two quantum optimisation methods, Variational Quantum
Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm and Quantum Approximate Optimisation Algorithm
(QAOA). These algorithms are respectively executed on both classical devices
and IBM's suite of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. We have
encoded the COP problems for the respective technologies and algorithms and
provided the computational encodings for the NISQ devices. Our experimental
results show that current classical devices significantly outperform the
presently available NISQ devices, which agrees and extends with findings in the
literature. Further, we introduce additional performance metrics to better
compare the two approaches concerning computational time, feasibility and
solution quality. Our results show that the VQE performs better than QAOA for
these metrics, and we infer that this is due to the increased number of
operations required. Additionally, we investigate the impact of a new set of
basis gates on the quantum optimisation techniques and show they yield no
notable improvement in the results. Finally, we present the shortcomings of
state-of-the-art NISQ IBM quantum devices and argue for potential future work
and investigation.

much greater relief than anticipated, based on the minimal reduction in

and qualitative effects on nasal airflow using objective measures. This study
examined the impact of nasal adhesions at various anatomical sites on nasal

high-resolution CT scan of the paranasal sinuses of a 25-year-old, healthy
female patient was segmented to create a three-dimensional nasal airway model.
Virtual nasal adhesions of 2.5~mm diameter were added to various locations
within the nasal cavity, representing common sites seen following NAO surgery.
A series of models with single adhesions were created. CFD analysis was
performed on each model and compared with a baseline no-adhesion model,
comparing airflow and heat and mass transfer. The nasal adhesions resulted in
no significant change in bulk airflow patterns through the nasal cavity.
However, significant changes were observed in local airflow and mucosal cooling
around and immediately downstream to the nasal adhesions. These were most
evident with anterior nasal adhesions at the internal valve and anterior
inferior turbinate.

context, two types of image representations i.e. local and global image
features have been studied in the literature. Extracting these features from
pixel images and comparing them with images from the database is very
time-consuming. Therefore, in recent years, there has been some effort to
accomplish image analysis directly in the compressed domain with lesser
computations. Furthermore, most of the images in our daily transactions are
stored in the JPEG compressed format. Therefore, it would be ideal if we could
retrieve features directly from the partially decoded or compressed data and
use them for retrieval. Here, we propose a unified model for image retrieval
which takes DCT coefficients as input and efficiently extracts global and local
features directly in the JPEG compressed domain for accurate image retrieval.
The experimental findings indicate that our proposed model performed similarly
to the current DELG model which takes RGB features as an input with reference
to mean average precision while having a faster training and retrieval speed.

fields. How to better understand the physical mechanism of RT instability is of
great theoretical significance and practical value. At present, abundant
results of RT instability have been obtained by traditional macroscopic
methods. However, research on the thermodynamic non-equilibrium (TNE) effects
in the process of system evolution is relatively scarce. In this paper, the
discrete Boltzmann method based on non-equilibrium statistical physics is
utilized to study the effects of the specific heat ratio on compressible RT
instability. The evolution process of the compressible RT system with different
specific heat ratios can be analyzed by the temperature gradient and the
proportion of the non-equilibrium region. Firstly, as a result of the
competition between the macroscopic magnitude gradient and the non-equilibrium
region, the average TNE intensity first increases and then reduces, and it
increases with the specific heat ratio decreasing; the specific heat ratio has
the same effect on the global strength of the viscous stress tensor. Secondly,
the moment when the total temperature gradient in y direction deviates from the
fixed value can be regarded as a physical criterion for judging the formation
of the vortex structure. Thirdly, under the competition between the temperature
gradients and the contact area of the two fluids, the average intensity of the
non-equilibrium quantity related to the heat flux shows diversity, and the
influence of the specific heat ratio is also quite remarkable.

assumptions on $\boldsymbol{b}$, we show the convergence of such scheme to the
unique Lagrangian solution of the transport equation. Our proof is based on the
use of stochastic flows and yields quantitative rates of convergence. This
offers a completely general selection criterion for the transport equation
(even beyond the distributional regime) which compensates the wild
non-uniqueness phenomenon for solutions with low integrability arising from
convex integration constructions, as shown in recent works [8, 28, 29, 30], and
rules out the possibility of anomalous dissipation.

  Correctness Bug Detection","11 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables",,,,"cs.SE cs.DB cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Database Management System (DBMS) plays a core role in modern software from
mobile apps to online banking. It is critical that DBMS should provide correct
data to all applications. When the DBMS returns incorrect data, a correctness
bug is triggered. Current production-level DBMSs still suffer from insufficient
testing due to the limited hand-written test cases. Recently several works
proposed to automatically generate many test cases with query transformation, a
process of generating an equivalent query pair and testing a DBMS by checking
whether the system returns the same result set for both queries. However, all
of them still heavily rely on manual work to provide a transformation which
largely confines their exploration of the valid input query space.
  This paper introduces duplicate-sensitivity guided transformation synthesis
which automatically finds new transformations by first synthesizing many
candidates then filtering the nonequivalent ones. Our automated synthesis is
achieved by mutating a query while keeping its duplicate sensitivity, which is
a necessary condition for query equivalence. After candidate synthesis, we keep
the mutant query which is equivalent to the given one by using a query
equivalent checker. Furthermore, we have implemented our idea in a tool Eqsql
and used it to test the production-level DBMSs. In two months, we detected in
total 30 newly confirmed and unique bugs in MySQL, TiDB and CynosDB.

The biological media is both pliable enough to deform in response to an outside
force and can deform by itself using the work of an embedded muscle. For
example, the recent work (Ludeman et al., 2014) has demonstrated interesting
'sneezing' dynamics of a freshwater sponge, when the sponge contracts and
expands to clear itself from surrounding polluted water. We derive the
equations of motion for the dynamics of such an active porous media (i.e., a
deformable porous media that is capable of applying a force to itself with
internal muscles), filled with an incompressible fluid. These equations of
motion extend the earlier derived equation for a passive porous media filled
with an incompressible fluid. We use a variational approach with a Lagrangian
written as the sum of terms representing the kinetic and potential energy of
the elastic matrix, and the kinetic energy of the fluid, coupled through the
constraint of incompressibility. We then proceed to extend this theory by
computing the case when both the active porous media and the fluid are
incompressible, with the porous media still being deformable, which is often
the case for biological applications. For the particular case of a uniform
initial state, we rewrite the equations of motion in terms of two coupled
telegraph-like equations for the material (Lagrangian) particles expressed in
the Eulerian frame of reference, particularly suitable for numerical
simulations, formulated for both the compressible media/incompressible fluid
case and the doubly incompressible case. We derive interesting conservation
laws for the motion, perform numerical simulations in both cases and show the
possibility of self-propulsion of a biological organism due to particular
running wave-like application of the muscle stress.

recent years due to their elegance, connections to online algorithms,
stochastic optimization, and mechanism design problems in game theoretic
settings. Rubinstein and Singla developed a notion of combinatorial prophet
inequalities in order to generalize the standard prophet inequality setting to
combinatorial valuation functions such as submodular and subadditive functions.
For non-negative submodular functions they demonstrated a constant factor
prophet inequality for matroid constraints. Along the way they showed a variant
of the correlation gap for non-negative submodular functions.
  In this paper we revisit their notion of correlation gap as well as the
standard notion of correlation gap and prove much tighter and cleaner bounds.
Via these bounds and other insights we obtain substantially improved constant
factor combinatorial prophet inequalities for both monotone and non-monotone
submodular functions over any constraint that admits an Online Contention
Resolution Scheme. In addition to improved bounds we describe efficient
polynomial-time algorithms that achieve these bounds.

prediction is a challenging task since it is affected by the social interactive
behaviors of neighboring vehicles, and the number of neighboring vehicles can
vary in different situations. This work proposes a GNN-RNN based
Encoder-Decoder network for interaction-aware trajectory prediction, where
vehicles' dynamics features are extracted from their historical tracks using
RNN, and the inter-vehicular interaction is represented by a directed graph and
encoded using a GNN. The parallelism of GNN implies the proposed method's
potential to predict multi-vehicular trajectories simultaneously. Evaluation on
the dataset extracted from the NGSIM US-101 dataset shows that the proposed

the main issues in this task is how to handle the dramatic scale variations of
pedestrians caused by the perspective effect. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a novel convolution neural network-based crowd counting method, termed
Perspective-guided Fractional-Dilation Network (PFDNet). By modeling the
continuous scale variations, the proposed PFDNet is able to select the proper
fractional dilation kernels for adapting to different spatial locations. It
significantly improves the flexibility of the state-of-the-arts that only
consider the discrete representative scales. In addition, by avoiding the
multi-scale or multi-column architecture that used in other methods, it is
computationally more efficient. In practice, the proposed PFDNet is constructed
by stacking multiple Perspective-guided Fractional-Dilation Convolutions (PFC)
on a VGG16-BN backbone. By introducing a novel generalized dilation convolution
operation, the PFC can handle fractional dilation ratios in the spatial domain
under the guidance of perspective annotations, achieving continuous scales
modeling of pedestrians. To deal with the problem of unavailable perspective
information in some cases, we further introduce an effective perspective
estimation branch to the proposed PFDNet, which can be trained in either
supervised or weakly-supervised setting once the branch has been pre-trained.
Extensive experiments show that the proposed PFDNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on ShanghaiTech A, ShanghaiTech B, WorldExpo'10,
UCF-QNRF, UCF_CC_50 and TRANCOS dataset, achieving MAE 53.8, 6.5, 6.8, 84.3,

and X-ray luminosity, \dt hereafter, in UV/optically-selected tidal disruption
events (TDEs). The following picture explains the observed \dt in several TDEs
as a consequence of the circularization and disk accretion processes as long as
the sub-Eddington accretion. At the beginning of the circularization, the
fallback debris is thermalized by the self-crossing shock caused by
relativistic precession, providing the peak optical emission. During the
circularization process, the mass fallback rate decreases with time to form a
ring around the supermassive black hole (SMBH). The formation timescale
corresponds to the circularization timescale of the most tightly bound debris,
which is less than a year to several decades, depending mostly on the
penetration factor, the circularization efficiency, and the black hole mass.
The ring will subsequently evolve viscously over the viscous diffusion time. We
find that it accretes onto the SMBH on a fraction of the viscous timescale,
which is $2$ years for given typical parameters, leading to X-ray emission at
late times. The resultant \dt\,is given by the sum of the circularization
timescale and the accretion timescale and significantly decreases with
increasing penetration factor to several to $\sim10$ years typically. Since the
X-ray luminosity substantially decreases as the viewing angle between the
normal to the disk plane and line-of-sight increases from $0^\circ$ to
$90^\circ$, a low late-time X-ray luminosity can be explained by an edge-on
view. We also discuss the super-Eddington accretion scenario, where \dt\,is
dominated by the circularization timescale.

only `point coordinates' for nova/SN candidates were published, is fabricated.
Their estimate of expected nova detection rates is off by a factor of 10 due to
miscalculation. They accept counterparts down to 4 to 7 mag at peak, which is
against the consensus for the typical limit of naked-eye discovery. When they
discuss previously suggested identifications of historical novae, which they
all doubt, they do not present new facts (Hoffmann 2019). Their catalog of `24

recent literature (e.g. Pankenier et al. 2008 and Stephenson and Green 2009),
the claimed methods are not followed, etc. At least half of their short-list

duration of more than one night and/or a precise position is missing and/or the

a presumable recurrent nova in AD 891, are already rejected in detail in
Neuhaeuser et al. (2021); in both cases, all evidence speaks in favor of
comets. There remains only one reliable case, where close to one (possible)
historically reported position, a nova shell was already found (AD 1437, Shara

of determining the neutrino mass ordering by studying the oscillated
anti-neutrino flux coming from two nuclear power plants at 53 km distance. The
expected signal anti-neutrino interaction rate is only 60 counts per day,
therefore a careful control of the background sources due to radioactivity is
critical. In particular, natural radioactivity present in all materials and in
the environment represents a serious issue that could impair the sensitivity of
the experiment if appropriate countermeasures were not foreseen. In this paper
we discuss the background reduction strategies undertaken by the JUNO
collaboration to reduce at minimum the impact of natural radioactivity. We
describe our efforts for an optimized experimental design, a careful material
screening and accurate detector production handling, and a constant control of
the expected results through a meticulous Monte Carlo simulation program. We
show that all these actions should allow us to keep the background count rate
safely below the target value of 10 Hz in the default fiducial volume, above an

a model to solve PDEs based on operator representation with regularization from
data. For linear PDEs, we use a DNN to parameterize the Green's function and
obtain the neural operator to approximate the solution according to the Green's
method. To train the DNN, the empirical risk consists of the mean squared loss
with the least square formulation or the variational formulation of the
governing equation and boundary conditions. For complicated problems, the
empirical risk also includes a few labels, which are computed on coarse grid
points with cheap computation cost and significantly improves the model
accuracy. Intuitively, the labeled dataset works as a regularization in
addition to the model constraints. The MOD-Net solves a family of PDEs rather
than a specific one and is much more efficient than original neural operator
because few expensive labels are required. We numerically show MOD-Net is very
efficient in solving Poisson equation and one-dimensional radiative transfer
equation. For nonlinear PDEs, the nonlinear MOD-Net can be similarly used as an
ansatz for solving nonlinear PDEs, exemplified by solving several nonlinear PDE
problems, such as the Burgers equation.

selection, and forecasting of continuous-time integer-valued trawl processes.
The full likelihood of integer-valued trawl processes is, in general, highly
intractable, motivating the use of composite likelihood methods, where we
consider the pairwise likelihood in lieu of the full likelihood. Maximizing the
pairwise likelihood of the data yields an estimator of the parameter vector of
the model, and we prove consistency and, in the short memory case, asymptotic
normality of this estimator. When the underlying trawl process has long memory,
the asymptotic behaviour of the estimator is more involved; we present some
partial results for this case. The pairwise approach further allows us to
develop probabilistic forecasting methods, which can be used to construct the
predictive distribution of integer-valued time series. In a simulation study,
we document the good finite sample performance of the likelihood-based
estimator and the associated model selection procedure. Lastly, the methods are
illustrated in an application to modelling and forecasting financial bid-ask
spread data, where we find that it is beneficial to carefully model both the
marginal distribution and the autocorrelation structure of the data.

The hybrid device optical responses, such as electromagnetic induced
transparency (EIT) and group delay, can be modulated in several ways. First, it
is modulated electrically by changing the conductivity and carrier
concentrations in graphene. Alternatively, the optical response can be modified
by acting on the device temperature sensitivity, by switching Nb from a lossy
normal phase to a low-loss quantum mechanical phase below the transition
temperature (Tc) of Nb. Maximum modulation depths of 57.3 % and 97.61 % are
achieved for EIT and group delay at the THz transmission window, respectively.
A comparison is carried out between the Nb-graphene-Nb coupled SRR-based
devices with those of Au-graphene-Au SRRs and a significant enhancement of the
THz transmission, group delay, and EIT responses are observed when Nb is in the
quantum mechanical phase. Such hybrid devices with their reasonably large and
tunable slow light bandwidth pave the way for the realization of active

However, the validity of the a priori assumption of local equilibrium has been
questioned due to the lack of sufficient experimental evidence. In this paper,
we present experimental results obtained from a pure thermodynamic study of the
non-turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection at steady-state to verify the
validity of the local equilibrium hypothesis. A non-turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard
convection at steady-state is an excellent `model thermodynamic system' in
which local measurements do not convey the complete picture about the spatial
heterogeneity present in the macroscopic thermodynamic landscape. Indeed, the
onset of convection leads to the emergence of spatially stable hot and cold
domains. Our results indicate that these domains while break spatial symmetry
macroscopically, preserves it locally that exhibit room temperature
equilibrium-like statistics. Furthermore, the role of the emergent heat flux is
investigated and a linear relationship is observed between the heat flux and
the external driving force following the onset of thermal convection. Finally,
theoretical and conceptual implications of these results are discussed which
opens up new avenues in the study non-equilibrium steady-states, especially in
complex, soft, and active-matter systems.

fundamental but unsolved questions in astrophysics. In transient black-hole
binaries, a lot of mass stored in an accretion disk is suddenly drained to the
central black hole because of thermal-viscous instability. This phenomenon is
called an outburst and is observable at various wavelengths (Frank et al.,
2002). During the outburst, the accretion structure in the vicinity of a black
hole shows dramatical transitions from a geometrically-thick hot accretion flow
to a geometrically-thin disk, and the transition is observed at X-ray
wavelengths (Remillard, McClintock, 2006; Done et al., 2007). However, how that
X-ray transition occurs remains a major unsolved problem (Dunn et al., 2008).
Here we report extensive optical photometry during the 2018 outburst of
ASASSN-18ey (MAXI J1820$+$070), a black-hole binary at a distance of 3.06 kpc
(Tucker et al., 2018; Torres et al., 2019) containing a black hole and a donor
star of less than one solar mass. We found optical large-amplitude periodic
variations similar to superhumps which are well observed in a subclass of
white-dwarf binaries (Kato et al., 2009). In addition, the start of the stage
transition of the optical variations was observed 5 days earlier than the X-ray
transition. This is naturally explained on the basis of our knowledge regarding
white dwarf binaries as follows: propagation of the eccentricity inward in the
disk makes an increase of the accretion rate in the outer disk, resulting in
huge mass accretion to the black hole. Moreover, we provide the dynamical
estimate of the binary mass ratio by using the optical periodic variations for
the first time in transient black-hole binaries. This paper opens a new window
to measure black-hole masses accurately by systematic optical time-series
observations which can be performed even by amateur observers.

associate each topic with a probability distribution on the dictionary of words
and to consider each document as a mixture of topics. Since the number of
topics is typically substantially smaller than the size of the corpus and of
the dictionary, the methods of topic modeling can lead to a dramatic dimension
reduction. In this paper, we study the problem of estimating topics
distribution for each document in the given corpus, that is, we focus on the

that the error of the algorithm grows at most logarithmically with the size of

systems of hyperbolic conservation laws in one space dimension. The base scheme
uses a method of lines approach consisting of a discontinuous Galerkin scheme
in space and an explicit strong stability preserving Runge-Kutta scheme in
time. When applied on a cut cell mesh with a time step length that is
appropriate for the size of the larger background cells, one encounters
stability issues. The DoD stabilization consists of penalty terms that are
designed to address these problems by redistributing mass between the inflow
and outflow neighbors of small cut cells in a physical way. For piecewise
constant polynomials in space and explicit Euler in time, the stabilized scheme
is monotone for scalar problems. For higher polynomial degrees $p$, our
numerical experiments show convergence orders of $p+1$ for smooth flow and
robust behavior in the presence of shocks.

(SAM) for a galaxy of total (baryonic) mass $\mathcal{M}$:
$j_M(\mathcal{M})\equiv\mathcal{M}^{3/4}(G^3/a_0)^{1/4}\approx
383(\mathcal{M}/10^{10}M_\odot)^{3/4}{\rm kpc~km/s}$. It plays important roles
in disc-galaxy dynamics and evolution: It underlies scaling relations in
virialized galaxies that involve their angular-momentum. I show that the disc
SAM should be $j_D\approx[\langle
r\rangle/r_M(\mathcal{M})]j_M(\mathcal{M})=[\Sigma_M/\langle
\Sigma\rangle]^{1/2}j_M(\mathcal{M})$, with $\langle r\rangle$ the mean radius
of the disc, $\langle \Sigma\rangle=\mathcal{M}/2\pi\langle r\rangle^2$ some
mean surface density of the galaxy, $r_M=(\mathcal{M} G/a_0)^{1/2}$ is the MOND
radius of the galaxy, and $\Sigma_M=a_0/2\pi G$ is the (universal) MOND surface
density. So, e.g., for a fixed $\langle \Sigma\rangle$, $j_D\propto
\mathcal{M}^{3/4}$, while for a fixed $\langle r\rangle$, $j_D\propto
\mathcal{M}^{1/4}$. Furthermore, $j_M(\mathcal{M})$ is a reference predictor of
the type of galaxy a protogalaxy will settle into, if it evolves in isolation:
A protogalaxy of mass $\mathcal{M}$, and SAM $j\gg j_M(\mathcal{M})$ should
settle into a low-surface-density disc -- with mean acceleration $\langle
a\rangle/a_0\approx j_M/j\ll 1$. While a protogalaxy with $j\lesssim
j_M(\mathcal{M})$ should end up with a disc of mass $\mathcal{M}_D\approx
j\mathcal{M}/j_M(\mathcal{M})$, having a SAM $j_D\approx j_M(\mathcal{M})$,
which is tantamount to $\langle a\rangle\approx a_0$ (i.e., at the `Freeman
limit'); it should also develop a low-SAM bulge, taking up the rest of the mass
$\mathcal{M}_B\approx\mathcal{M}-\mathcal{M}_D$.

function systems $\{f^\lambda_j\}$ on the real line. Given a family of
parameter dependent measures $\{\mu_{\lambda}\}$ on the symbolic space, we
study geometric and dimensional properties of their images under the natural
projection maps $\Pi^\lambda$. The main novelty of our work is that the
measures $\mu_\lambda$ depend on the parameter, whereas up till now it has been
usually assumed that the measure on the symbolic space is fixed and the
parameter dependence comes only from the natural projection. This is especially
the case in the question of absolute continuity of the projected measure
$(\Pi^\lambda)_*\mu_\lambda$, where we had to develop a new approach in place
of earlier attempt which contains an error. Our main result states that if
$\mu_\lambda$ are Gibbs measures for a family of H\""older continuous potentials
$\phi^\lambda$, with H\""older continuous dependence on $\lambda$ and
$\{\Pi^\lambda\}$ satisfy the transversality condition, then the projected
measure $(\Pi^\lambda)_*\mu_\lambda$ is absolutely continuous for Lebesgue
a.e.\ $\lambda$, such that the ratio of entropy over the Lyapunov exponent is
strictly greater than $1$. We deduce it from a more general almost sure lower
bound on the Sobolev dimension for families of measures with regular enough
dependence on the parameter. Under less restrictive assumptions, we also obtain
an almost sure formula for the Hausdorff dimension. As applications of our
results, we study stationary measures for iterated function systems with
place-dependent probabilities (place-dependent Bernoulli convolutions and the
Blackwell measure for binary channel) and equilibrium measures for hyperbolic
IFS with overlaps (in particular: natural measures for non-homogeneous
self-similar IFS and certain systems corresponding to random continued

in unlocking the protostellar accretion process and its impact on planet
formation. The aim is to determine which physical components are traced by
different molecules at sub-arcsecond scales (100 - 400 au). We use a suite of
Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) datasets in Band 6 (1 mm),
Band 5 (1.8 mm) and Band 3 (3 mm) at spatial resolutions 0.5 - 3"" for 16
protostellar sources. The protostellar envelope is well traced by C$^{18}$O,
DCO$^+$ and N$_2$D$^+$, with the freeze-out of CO governing the chemistry at
envelope scales. Molecular outflows are seen in classical shock tracers like
SiO and SO, but ice-mantle products such as CH$_3$OH and HNCO released with the
shock are also observed. The molecular jet is prominent not only in SiO and SO
but also occasionally in H$_2$CO. The cavity walls show tracers of
UV-irradiation such as C$_2$H c-C$_3$H$_2$ and CN. The hot inner envelope,
apart from showing emission from complex organic molecules (COMs), also
presents compact emission from small molecules like H$_2$S, SO, OCS and
H$^{13}$CN, most likely related to ice sublimation and high-temperature
chemistry. Sub-arcsecond millimeter-wave observations allow to identify those
(simple) molecules that best trace each of the physical components of a
protostellar system. COMs are found both in the hot inner envelope (high
excitation lines) and in the outflows (lower-excitation lines) with comparable
abundances. COMs can coexist with hydrocarbons in the same protostellar
sources, but they trace different components. In the near future, mid-IR
observations with JWST-MIRI will provide complementary information about the
hottest gas and the ice mantle content, at unprecedented sensitivity and at
resolutions comparable to ALMA for the same sources.

detail the performance of the system using simulations and a calibration of the
Cherenkov detector at the ELBE accelerator. Single 3 GeV leptons are expected
to produce approximately 537 detectable photons in a single calorimeter

utmost importance for many applications in the medical sector. Within this
contribution we propose a new macroscopic approach fro modelling stress-driven
volumetric growth occurring in soft tissues. Instead of using the standard
approach of a-priori defining the structure of the growth tensor, we postulate
the existance of a general growth potential. Such a potential describes all
eligable homeostatic stress states that can ultimately be reached as a result
of the growth process. Making use of well established methods from
visco-plasticity, the evolution of the growth related right Cauchy-Green tensor
is subsequently defined as a time dependent associative evolution law with
respect to the introduced potential. This approach naturally leads to a
formulation that is able to cover both, isotropic and anisotropic growth
related changes in geometry. It furthermore allows the model to flexibly adapt
to changing boundary and loading conditions. Besides the theoretical
development, we also describe the algorithmic implementation and furthermore
compare the newly derived model with a standard formulation of isotropic
growth.

gravitational-wave transients in data from the third observing run of Advanced
LIGO and Advanced Virgo. Transients with durations of milliseconds to a few
seconds in the 24--4096 Hz frequency band are targeted by the search, with no
assumptions made regarding the incoming signal direction, polarization or
morphology. Gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences that have been
identified by other targeted analyses are detected, but no statistically
significant evidence for other gravitational wave bursts is found.
Sensitivities to a variety of signals are presented. These include updated
upper limits on the source rate-density as a function of the characteristic
frequency of the signal, which are roughly an order of magnitude better than
previous upper limits. This search is sensitive to sources radiating as little
as $\sim$10$^{-10} M_{\odot} c^2$ in gravitational waves at $\sim$70 Hz from a
distance of 10~kpc, with 50\% detection efficiency at a false alarm rate of one
per century. The sensitivity of this search to two plausible astrophysical
sources is estimated: neutron star f-modes, which may be excited by pulsar
glitches, as well as selected core-collapse supernova models.

rhombohedral BiFeO3 and orthorhombic SrRuO3 the total thickness of all SLs was
kept constant and the bilayer thickness (period) {\Lambda} was varied. The
interlayer strain effects are therefore tuned from large strain effects (short
{\Lambda} period) to quasi-relaxed structure (large {\Lambda}). A complementary
investigation using X-ray diffraction and phonon dynamics hints to change from
a rhombohedral to a tetragonal structure in the superlattices with the increase
of the interlayer strain effect.

Particularly, in Sr2RuO4, the Ehrenfest relations, the velocity propagation of
the elastic field modes, and the ultrasound attenuation find a common point to
study elastic anisotropic lattice field effects at the transition temperature
(Tc) between the normal and the superconducting state. Ehrenfest relations are
suitable for establishing a phase diagram of the Tc point according to symmetry
consideration of the electrons pairs in unconventional superconductors. Further

the attainment and stability of unipolar or bipolar societies. However,
multipolar societies are commonplace in the real world, despite the fact that
the mechanism of their emergence is much less explored. Here, we investigate
the evolution of a society of interacting agents with friendly (positive) and
enmity (negative) relations into a final stable multipolar state. Triads are
assigned energy according to the degree of tension they impose on the network.
Agents update their connections in order to decrease the total energy (tension)
of the system, on average. Our approach is to consider a variable energy
$\epsilon\in[0,1]$ for triads which are entirely made of negative relations. We
show that the final state of the system depends on the initial density of the
friendly links $\rho_0$. For initial densities greater than an $\epsilon$
dependent threshold $\rho^c_0(\epsilon)$ unipolar (paradise) state is reached.
However, for $\rho_0 \leq \rho^c_0(\epsilon)$ multi-polar and bipolar states
can emerge. We observe that the number of stable final poles increases with
decreasing $\epsilon$ where the first transition from bipolar to multipolar
society occurs at $\epsilon^*\approx 0.67$. We end the paper by providing a
mean-field calculation that provides an estimate for the critical ($\epsilon$
dependent) initial positive link density, which is consistent with our
simulations.

to their rupture. However, biological systems can adapt to loads by
strengthening adhesions, which is essential for maintaining the integrity of
tissue and whole organisms. Inspired by cellular focal adhesions, we suggest
here a generic, molecular mechanism that allows adhesion systems to harness
applied loads for self-stabilization under non-equilibrium conditions --
without any active feedback involved. The mechanism is based on conformation
changes of adhesion molecules that are dynamically exchanged with a reservoir.
Tangential loading drives the occupation of some stretched conformation states
out of equilibrium, which, for thermodynamic reasons, leads to association of
further molecules with the adhesion cluster. Self-stabilization robustly
increases adhesion lifetimes in broad parameter ranges. Unlike for catch-bonds,
bond dissociation rates do not decrease with force. The self-stabilization
principle can be realized in many ways in complex adhesion-state networks; we
show how it naturally occurs in cellular adhesions involving the adaptor
proteins talin and vinculin.

complex robots (such as humanoids, quadrupeds, or unmanned aerial manipulators
(UAMs)) as it brings important advantages over other existing techniques. The
full-body dynamics, along with the prediction capability of the optimal control
problem (OCP) solved at the core of the controller, allows to actuate the robot
in line with its dynamics. This fact enhances the robot capabilities and
allows, e.g., to perform intricate maneuvers at high dynamics while optimizing
the amount of energy used. Despite the many similarities between humanoids or
quadrupeds and UAMs, full-body torque-level nMPC has rarely been applied to
UAMs.
  This paper provides a thorough description of how to use such techniques in
the field of aerial manipulation. We give a detailed explanation of the
different parts involved in the OCP, from the UAM dynamical model to the
residuals in the cost function. We develop and compare three different nMPC
controllers: Weighted MPC, Rail MPC, and Carrot MPC, which differ on the
structure of their OCPs and on how these are updated at every time step. To
validate the proposed framework, we present a wide variety of simulated case
studies. First, we evaluate the trajectory generation problem, i.e., optimal
control problems solved offline, involving different kinds of motions (e.g.,
aggressive maneuvers or contact locomotion) for different types of UAMs. Then,
we assess the performance of the three nMPC controllers, i.e., closed-loop
controllers solved online, through a variety of realistic simulations. For the

galaxies (LAE) in the MUSE-Wide survey. All objects have spectroscopically
confirmed redshifts in the range $3.3<z<6$. We employ the K-estimator of
Adelberger et al. (2005), adapted and optimized for our sample. We also explore
the standard two-point correlation function approach, which is however less
suited for a pencil-beam survey such as ours. The results from both approaches
are consistent. We parametrize the clustering properties by, (i) modelling the
clustering signal with a power law (PL), and (ii) adopting a Halo Occupation
Distribution (HOD) model. Applying HOD modeling, we infer a large-scale bias of
$b_{\rm{HOD}}=2.80^{+0.38}_{-0.38}$ at a median redshift of the number of
galaxy pairs $\langle z_{\rm pair}\rangle\simeq3.82$, while the PL analysis
results in $b_{\rm{PL}}=3.03^{+1.51}_{-0.52}$
($r_0=3.60^{+3.10}_{-0.90}\;h^{-1}$Mpc and $\gamma=1.30^{+0.36}_{-0.45}$). The
implied typical dark matter halo (DMH) mass is
$\log(M_{\rm{DMH}}/[h^{-1}\rm{M}_\odot])=11.34^{+0.23}_{-0.27}$. We study
possible dependencies of the clustering signal on object properties by
bisecting the sample into disjoint subsets, considering Ly$\alpha$ luminosity,
UV absolute magnitude, Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width, and redshift as variables.
We find a suggestive trend of more luminous Ly$\alpha$ emitters residing in
more massive DMHs than their lower Ly$\alpha$ luminosity counterparts. We also
compare our results to mock LAE catalogs based on a semi-analytic model of
galaxy formation and find a stronger clustering signal than in our observed
sample. By adopting a galaxy-conserving model we estimate that the LAEs in the
MUSE-Wide survey will typically evolve into galaxies hosted by halos of
$\log(M_{\rm{DMH}}/[h^{-1}\rm{M}_\odot])\approx13.5$ at redshift zero,
suggesting that we observe the ancestors of present-day galaxy groups.

  Fluids",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When two spherical particles submerged in a viscous fluid are subjected to an
oscillatory flow, they align themselves perpendicular to the direction of the
flow leaving a small gap between them. The formation of this compact structure
is attributed to a non-zero residual flow known as steady streaming. We have
performed direct numerical simulations of a fully-resolved, oscillating flow in
which the pair of particles is modeled using an immersed boundary method. Our
simulations show that the particles oscillate both parallel and perpendicular
to the oscillating flow in elongated figure 8 trajectories. In absence of
bottom friction, the mean gap between the particles depends only on the
normalized Stokes boundary layer thickness $\delta^*$, and on the normalized,
streamwise excursion length of the particles relative to the fluid $A_r^*$
(equivalent to the Keulegan-Carpenter number). For $A_r^*\lesssim 1$, viscous
effects dominate and the mean particle separation only depends on $\delta^*$.
For larger $A_r^*$-values, advection becomes important and the gap widens.
Overall, the normalized mean gap between the particles scales as
$L^*\approx3.0{\delta^*}^{1.5}+0.03{A_r^*}^3$, which also agrees well with
previous experimental results. The two regimes are also observed in the
magnitude of the oscillations of the gap perpendicular to the flow, which
increases in the viscous regime and decreases in the advective regime. When
bottom friction is considered, particle rotation increases and the gap widens.
Our results stress the importance of simulating the particle motion with all
its degrees of freedom to accurately model the system and reproduce
experimental results. The new insights of the particle pairs provide an
important step towards understanding denser and more complex systems.

Clustering 3EC' algorithm that classifies unlabeled data into quality clusters
as a part of unsupervised learning. It offers the flexibility to explore the
context of new clusters formed by an ensemble of algorithms based on internal
validation indices.
  It is worth mentioning that the input data set is considered to be a cluster
of clusters. An anomaly can possibly manifest as a cluster as well. Each
partitioned cluster is considered to be a new data set and is a candidate to
explore the most optimal algorithm and its number of partition splits until a
predefined stopping criteria is met. The algorithms independently partition the
data set into clusters and the quality of the partitioning is assessed by an
ensemble of internal cluster validation indices. The 3EC algorithm presents the
validation index scores from a choice of algorithms and its configuration of
partitions and it is called the Tau Grid. 3EC chooses the most optimal score.
The 3EC algorithm owes its name to the two input ensembles of algorithms and
internal validation indices and an output ensemble of final clusters.
  Quality plays an important role in this clustering approach and it also acts
as a stopping criteria from further partitioning. Quality is determined based
on the quality of the clusters provided by an algorithm and its optimal number
of splits. The 3EC algorithm determines this from the score of the ensemble of
validation indices. The user can configure the stopping criteria by providing
quality thresholds for the score range of each of the validation indices and
the optimal size of the output cluster. The users can experiment with different
sets of stopping criteria and choose the most 'sensible group' of quality
clusters

floes dynamics in a large-scale experiment and directly measuring and
quantifying the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). The field work was carried out
at Van Mijen Fjord on Svalbard, where a 3x4 m ice floe was sawed out in the
fast ice. Wave motion was simulated by pulling the ice floe back and forth in
an oscillatory manner in a 4x6 m pool, using two electrical winches. Ice floe
motion was measured with a range meter and accelerometers, and the water
turbulence was measured acoustically with an acoustic Doppler current profiler
and optically with a remotely operated vehicle and bubbles as tracers. TKE
frequency spectra were found to contain an inertial subrange where energy was
cascading at a rate proportional to the -5/3 power law. The TKE dissipation
rate was found to decrease exponentially with depth. The total TKE dissipation
rate was estimated by assuming that turbulence was induced over an area
corresponding to the surface of the floe. The results suggest that
approximately 37% and 8% of the input power from the winches was dissipated in
turbulence and absorbed in the collisions, respectively, which experimentally
confirms that energy dissipation by induced turbulent water motion is an
important mechanism for colliding ice floe fields.

Training machine learning models to predict lattice thermal conductivity could
offer an effective procedure to identify low lattice thermal conductivity
compounds. However, in doing so, we must face the fact that such compounds can
be quite rare and distinct from those in a typical training set. This
distinctness can be problematic as standard machine learning methods are
inaccurate when predicting properties of compounds with features differing
significantly from those in the training set. By computing the lattice thermal
conductivity of 122 half-Heusler compounds, using the temperature-dependent
effective potential method, we generate a data set to explore this issue. We
first show how random forest regression can fail to identify low lattice
thermal conductivity compounds with random selection of training data. Next, we
show how active selection of training data using feature and principal
component analysis can be used to improve model performance and the ability to
identify low lattice thermal conductivity compounds. Lastly, we find that
active learning without the use of DFT-based features can be viable as a
quicker way of selecting samples.

automorphism group $G$ of the Jacobian $J=J(C)$ is the group of order $336$,
obtained by adding minus identity to $H$. The quotient variety $J/G$ can be
alternatively represented as the quotient $\mathbb C^3/\tilde G$ of the complex
$3$-space by the complex crystallographic group $\tilde G$, the extension of
$G$ by the period lattice of the Klein quartic. Moreover, it turns out that
$\tilde G$ is generated by affine complex reflections. According to a
conjecture of Bernstein--Schwarzman, a quotient of $\mathbb C^n$ by an
irreducible complex crystallographic group generated by reflections is a
weighted projective space. The conjecture is known in dimension two and for
complexifications of the real crystallographic groups generated by reflections.
The case of $\tilde G$ is the first, and in a sense the smallest of the unknown

and deduce that $J/G=\mathbf C^3/\tilde G$ is a strongly simply connected
variety with the same singularities as the weighted projective space $\mathbb
P(1,2,4,7)$.

three main ingredients: a coupling based on the gradient flow, the use of

(Nl)^2$, a choice motivated by the study of volume independence in large $N$

particularly suited for precision determinations of the strong coupling, among
them translational invariance, an analytic expansion in the coupling and a
reduced memory footprint with respect to standard simulations on symmetric
lattices, allowing for a more efficient use of current GPU clusters. We test
this scheme numerically with a determination of the $\Lambda$ parameter in the
$SU(3)$ pure gauge theory. We show that the use of an asymmetric geometry has
no significant impact in the size of scaling violations, obtaining a value
$\Lambda_{\overline{MS}} \sqrt{8 t_0} =0.603(17)$ in good agreement with the

the global scientific enterprise grows at an exponential pace, at the
mesoscopic level the exploration and exploitation of research ideas is
reflected through the rise and fall of research fields. The empirical
literature has largely studied such dynamics on a case-by-case basis, with a
focus on explaining how and why communities of knowledge production evolve.
Although fields rise and fall on different temporal and population scales, they
are generally argued to pass through a common set of evolutionary stages. To
understand the social processes that drive these stages beyond case studies, we
need a way to quantify and compare different fields on the same terms. In this
paper we develop techniques for identifying scale-invariant patterns in the
evolution of scientific fields, and demonstrate their usefulness using 1.5
million preprints from the arXiv repository covering 175 research fields
spanning Physics, Mathematics, Computer Science, Quantitative Biology and
Quantitative Finance. We show that fields consistently follows a rise and fall
pattern captured by a two parameters right-tailed Gumbel temporal distribution.
We introduce a field-specific rescaled time and explore the generic properties
shared by articles and authors at the creation, adoption, peak, and decay
evolutionary phases. We find that the early phase of a field is characterized
by the mixing of cognitively distant fields by small teams of interdisciplinary
authors, while late phases exhibit the role of specialized, large teams
building on the previous works in the field. This method provides foundations
to quantitatively explore the generic patterns underlying the evolution of
research fields in science, with general implications in innovation studies.

  Perspective","unfinished version",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As the data scale grows, deep recognition models often suffer from
long-tailed data distributions due to the heavy imbalanced sample number across
categories. Indeed, real-world data usually exhibit some similarity relation
among different categories (e.g., pigeons and sparrows), called category
similarity in this work. It is doubly difficult when the imbalance occurs
between such categories with similar appearances. However, existing solutions
mainly focus on the sample number to re-balance data distribution. In this
work, we systematically investigate the essence of the long-tailed problem from
a unified perspective. Specifically, we demonstrate that long-tailed
recognition suffers from both sample number and category similarity.
Intuitively, using a toy example, we first show that sample number is not the
unique influence factor for performance dropping of long-tailed recognition.
Theoretically, we demonstrate that (1) category similarity, as an inevitable
factor, would also influence the model learning under long-tailed distribution
via similar samples, (2) using more discriminative representation methods
(e.g., self-supervised learning) for similarity reduction, the classifier bias
can be further alleviated with greatly improved performance. Extensive
experiments on several long-tailed datasets verify the rationality of our
theoretical analysis, and show that based on existing state-of-the-arts
(SOTAs), the performance could be further improved by similarity reduction. Our
investigations highlight the essence behind the long-tailed problem, and claim
several feasible directions for future work.

high and low inertia systems). Moreover, it is extremely efficient
computationally and so takes significantly less time than the PINN algorithm,
thus making it suitable for real-time parameter estimation.

  model of the hidden action problem",,,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Models of economic decision makers often include idealized assumptions, such
as rationality, perfect foresight, and access to all relevant pieces of
information. These assumptions often assure the models' internal validity, but,
at the same time, might limit the models' power to explain empirical phenomena.
This paper is particularly concerned with the model of the hidden action
problem, which proposes an optimal performance-based sharing rule for
situations in which a principal assigns a task to an agent, and the action
taken to carry out this task is not observable by the principal. We follow the
agentization approach and introduce an agent-based version of the hidden action
problem, in which some of the idealized assumptions about the principal and the
agent are relaxed so that they only have limited information access, are
endowed with the ability to gain information, and store it in and retrieve it
from their (limited) memory. We follow an evolutionary approach and analyze how
the principal's and the agent's decisions affect the sharing rule, task
performance, and their utility over time. The results indicate that the optimal
sharing rule does not emerge. The principal's utility is relatively robust to
variations in intelligence, while the agent's utility is highly sensitive to
limitations in intelligence. The principal's behavior appears to be driven by
opportunism, as she withholds a premium from the agent to assure the optimal
utility for herself.

WeChat.Unlike the previous studies which focused on how to detect the
misinformation or fake news related toCOVID-19, we investigate how the disease

information during the period when the disease was widely spread in China,
i.e., from January 25th to March 24th, 2020. We first explore how the disease
and information co-evolve via the spatial analysis of the two spreading
processes. We visualize the geo-location of both disease and information at the
province level and find that disease is more geo-localized compared to
information. We find a high correlation between the disease and information
data, and also people care about the spread only when it comes to their
neighborhood. Regard to the content of the information, we find that positive
messages are more negatively correlated with the disease compared to negative
and neutral messages. Additionally, we introduce machine learning algorithms,
i.e., linear regression and random forest, to further predict the number of
infected using different disease spatial related and information-related
characteristics. We obtain that the disease spatial related characteristics of
nearby cities can help to improve the prediction accuracy. Meanwhile,
information-related characteristics can also help to improve the prediction
performance, but with a delay, i.e., the improvement comes from using, for
instance, the number of messages 10 days ago, for disease prediction. The
methodology proposed in this paper may shed light on new clues of emerging

attention in recent years. Efforts are mainly focused on modeling structural
dependencies and temporal evolving regularities in Euclidean space which,
however, underestimates the inherent complex and hierarchical properties in
many real-world temporal networks, leading to sub-optimal embeddings. To
explore these properties of a complex temporal network, we propose a hyperbolic
temporal graph network (HTGN) that fully takes advantage of the exponential
capacity and hierarchical awareness of hyperbolic geometry. More specially,
HTGN maps the temporal graph into hyperbolic space, and incorporates hyperbolic
graph neural network and hyperbolic gated recurrent neural network, to capture
the evolving behaviors and implicitly preserve hierarchical information
simultaneously. Furthermore, in the hyperbolic space, we propose two important
modules that enable HTGN to successfully model temporal networks: (1)
hyperbolic temporal contextual self-attention (HTA) module to attend to
historical states and (2) hyperbolic temporal consistency (HTC) module to
ensure stability and generalization. Experimental results on multiple
real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of HTGN for temporal graph
embedding, as it consistently outperforms competing methods by significant
margins in various temporal link prediction tasks. Specifically, HTGN achieves
AUC improvement up to 9.98% for link prediction and 11.4% for new link
prediction. Moreover, the ablation study further validates the representational
ability of hyperbolic geometry and the effectiveness of the proposed HTA and

  Strategies","19 pages, 15 figures, 2 tables",,"10.4230/LITES.8.1.1",,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Face recognition approaches often rely on equal image resolution for
verifying faces on two images. However, in practical applications, those image
resolutions are usually not in the same range due to different image capture
mechanisms or sources. In this work, we first analyze the impact of image
resolutions on face verification performance with a state-of-the-art face
recognition model. For images synthetically reduced to $5\,\times\,5$ px
resolution, the verification performance drops from $99.23\%$ increasingly down
to almost $55\%$. Especially for cross-resolution image pairs (one high- and
one low-resolution image), the verification accuracy decreases even further. We
investigate this behavior more in-depth by looking at the feature distances for
every 2-image test pair. To tackle this problem, we propose the following two
methods: 1) Train a state-of-the-art face-recognition model straightforwardly
with $50\%$ low-resolution images directly within each batch. 2) Train a
siamese-network structure and add a cosine distance feature loss between high-
and low-resolution features. Both methods show an improvement for
cross-resolution scenarios and can increase the accuracy at very low resolution
to approximately $70\%$. However, a disadvantage is that a specific model needs
to be trained for every resolution pair. Thus, we extend the aforementioned
methods by training them with multiple image resolutions at once. The
performances for particular testing image resolutions are slightly worse, but
the advantage is that this model can be applied to arbitrary resolution images
and achieves an overall better performance ($97.72\%$ compared to $96.86\%$).
Due to the lack of a benchmark for arbitrary resolution images for the
cross-resolution and equal-resolution task, we propose an evaluation protocol
for five well-known datasets, focusing on high, mid, and low-resolution images.

the classic matrix Lie algebra approach, while retaining information about the
number of reflections in a given transformation. This imposes a graded
structure on Lie groups, which is not evident in their matrix representation.
By embracing this graded structure, the invariant decomposition theorem was
proven: any composition of $k$ linearly independent reflections can be
decomposed into $\lceil k/2 \rceil$ commuting factors, each of which is the
product of at most two reflections. This generalizes a conjecture by M. Riesz,
and has e.g. the Mozzi-Chasles' theorem as its 3D Euclidean special case. To
demonstrate its utility, we briefly discuss various examples such as Lorentz
transformations, Wigner rotations, and screw transformations. The invariant
decomposition also directly leads to closed form formulas for the exponential
and logarithmic function for all Spin groups, and identifies element of
geometry such as planes, lines, points, as the invariants of $k$-reflections.
We conclude by presenting novel matrix/vector representations for geometric
algebras $\mathbb{R}_{pqr}$, and use this in E(3) to illustrate the
relationship with the classic covariant, contravariant and adjoint

the performance of CNN-based object detectors on constrained devices by
applying different image compression techniques to satellite data. We examine
the capabilities of the NVIDIA Jetson Nano and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier;
low-power, high-performance computers, with integrated GPUs, small enough to

networks, including the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) and Region-based
Fully Convolutional Network (R-FCN) models that are pre-trained on DOTA - a
Large Scale Dataset for Object Detection in Aerial Images. The performance is
measured in terms of execution time, memory consumption, and accuracy, and are
compared against a baseline containing a server with two powerful GPUs. The
results show that by applying image compression techniques, we are able to
improve the execution time and memory consumption, achieving a fully runnable
dataset. A lossless compression technique achieves roughly a 10% reduction in
execution time and about a 3% reduction in memory consumption, with no impact
on the accuracy. While a lossy compression technique improves the execution
time by up to 144% and the memory consumption is reduced by as much as 97%.
However, it has a significant impact on accuracy, varying depending on the
compression ratio. Thus the application and ratio of these compression
techniques may differ depending on the required level of accuracy for a
particular task.

For each graph $G$, there exists an XOR-circuit $C$, whose input gates are

instances equipped with a preorder with colour classes of logarithmic size. Our
result implicitly extends this to preorders with colour classes of

of a solution to an unordered linear equation system $A \cdot x = b$ over a

In a geometric language, symmetries can be expressed in a natural manner as
vector fields that generate the corresponding symmetry group. Moreover, with
the geometric machinery, the phase space of a mechanical system with symmetries
can be reduced to a space with less dimensions. As it is well-known,
non-conservative forces cannot be written as the gradient of a potential, so
they cannot be absorbed in the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian. The description of a
mechanical system subject to a non-conservative force requires an external
force together with the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian function. In addition,
external forces emerge for the description of certain systems with
non-holonomic constraints.
  In this master's thesis, autonomous Hamiltonian and Lagrangian systems are
studied in the framework of symplectic geometry. After introducing the
geometric tools that will be employed, several results regarding symmetries and
constants of the motion are reviewed. The method of symplectic reduction for
systems with symmetry is also presented. In a second part, non-conservative
systems are presented in a geometric language. A Noether's theorem for
Lagrangian systems subject to external forces is obtained. Other results
regarding symmetries and constants of the motion are derived as well.
Furthermore, a theory for the reduction of forced Lagrangian systems invariant
under the action of a Lie group is presented. These results are particularized
for the so-called Rayleigh dissipation, that is, external forces that can be
written as the derivative of a ""potential"" with respect to the velocities.

applications, such as video retrieval and browsing, require compact
representations that are addressed by the video summarization literature.
Current supervised studies formulate video summarization as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem and the existing solutions often neglect
the surge of human-centric view, which inherently contains affective content.
In this study, we investigate the affective-information enriched supervised
video summarization task for human-centric videos. First, we train a visual
input-driven state-of-the-art continuous emotion recognition model (CER-NET) on
the RECOLA dataset to estimate emotional attributes. Then, we integrate the
estimated emotional attributes and the high-level representations from the
CER-NET with the visual information to define the proposed affective video
summarization architectures (AVSUM). In addition, we investigate the use of
attention to improve the AVSUM architectures and propose two new architectures
based on temporal attention (TA-AVSUM) and spatial attention (SA-AVSUM). We
conduct video summarization experiments on the TvSum database. The proposed
AVSUM-GRU architecture with an early fusion of high level GRU embeddings and
the temporal attention based TA-AVSUM architecture attain competitive video
summarization performances by bringing strong performance improvements for the
human-centric videos compared to the state-of-the-art in terms of F-score and
self-defined face recall metrics.

one-dimensional. In this work we consider a procedure to transform each

changed by use of increasing transformations. For any causal relationship we
show that there is always a way to transform the caused variable such that the

causal variable. Furthermore, the resulting universal entropy has an absolute
value that is equal to the channel capacity associated with the causal
relationship. This observation may be useful in statistical applications. Also,
for any causal relationship, it implies that there is a 'natural' way to
transform a continuous caused variable. We also show that, with additional
constraints on the causal relationship, a natural increasing transformation of

difficulties in modeling the 'relatively simple' problem of a rigid sphere in
contact with a viscoelastic half-space. For this reason, approximations in
describing surface interactions and viscous dissipation processes are usually
adopted in the literature. Here, we develop a fully deterministic model in
which adhesive interactions are described by Lennard-Jones potential and the
material behaviour with the standard linear solid model. Normal
loading-unloading cycles are carried out under different driving conditions.
When loading is performed in quasi-static conditions and, hence, unloading
starts from a completely relaxed state of the material, the effective surface
energy is found to monotonically increase with the contact line velocity up to
an asymptotic value reached at high unloading rates. Such result agrees with
existing theories on viscoelastic crack propagation. If loading and unloading
are performed at the same non-zero driving velocity and, hence, unloading
starts from an unrelaxed state of the material, the trend of the effective
surface energy {\Delta}{\gamma}eff with the contact line velocity is described
by a bell-shaped function in a double-logarithmic plot. The peak of
{\Delta}{\gamma}eff is found at a contact line velocity smaller than that makes
maximum the tangent loss of the viscoelastic modulus. Furthermore, we show
Gent\&Schultz assumption partly works in this case as viscous dissipation is no
longer localized along the contact perimeter but it also occurs in the bulk
material.

region are stellar streams. However, individual stream fits can be limited by
systematic biases. To study these individual stream systematics, we fit streams
in Milky Way-like galaxies from FIRE cosmological galaxy formation simulations
with an analytic gravitational potential by maximizing the clustering of stream
stars in action space. We show that for coherent streams the quality of the
constraints depends on the orbital phase of the observed stream stars, despite
the fact that the phase information is discarded in action-clustering methods.
Streams on intermediate phases give the most accurate results, whereas
pericentre streams can be highly biased. This behaviour is tied to the amount
of correlation present between positions and momenta in each stream's data:
weak correlation in pericentre streams prohibits efficient differentiation
between potentials, while strong correlation in intermediate streams promotes
it. Although simultaneous fitting of multiple streams is generally prescribed
as the remedy to combat individual stream biases, we find that combining
multiple pericentric streams is not enough to yield a bias-free result. We
finally show that adopting the two-component St\""ackel model does not
fundamentally induce a biased mass estimate. With our full data set of two
multi-wrap streams, we recovered the true rotation curve of the simulated

other types of malware. Based on the proposed analysis, we design a system that
can achieve robust and interpretable classification of Android malware. To
achieve robust classification, we perform contrastive learning on malware

corresponding heatmaps can be obtained by visualization techniques. These

rates with the 71 stars from the GTO program for which we have more than 50
observations. We use injection-and-retrieval experiments on the radial-velocity
(RV) time series to measure detection probabilities. We include 27 planets in
21 planetary systems in our analysis. We find 0.06+0.04-0.03 giant planets (100
M_Earth < M_pl sin i < 1000 M_Earth) per star in periods of up to 1000 d, but
due to a selection bias this number could be up to a factor of five lower in
the whole 329-star sample. The upper limit for hot Jupiters (orbital period of
less than 10 d) is 0.03 planets per star, while the occurrence rate of planets
with intermediate masses (10 M_Earth < M_pl sin i < 100 M_Earth) is
0.18+0.07-0.05 planets per star. Less massive planets with 1 M_Earth < M_pl sin
i < 10 M_Earth are very abundant, with an estimated rate of 1.32+0.33-0.31
planets per star for periods of up to 100 d. When considering only late M
dwarfs with masses M_star < 0.34 M_sol, planets more massive than 10 M_Earth
become rare. Instead, low-mass planets with periods shorter than 10 d are
significantly overabundant. For orbital periods shorter than 100 d, our results
confirm the known stellar mass dependences from the Kepler survey: M dwarfs
host fewer giant planets and at least two times more planets with M_pl sin i <
10 M_Earth than G-type stars. In contrast to previous results, planets around
our sample of very low-mass stars have a higher occurrence rate in short-period
orbits of less than 10 d. Our results demonstrate the need to take into account
host star masses in planet formation models.

improved thermoelectric (TE) performance. We report the effect of work function
and acoustic impedance mismatch (AIM) on the TE properties of
(1-z)Ge0.87Mn0.05Sb0.08Te/(z)WC composite. In particular, a composite
consisting of Mn and Sb co-doped GeTe as a matrix and WC as a dispersed phase
is prepared, and its structural and TE properties are investigated. The
simultaneous increase in electrical conductivity ({\sigma}) and Seebeck
coefficient ({\alpha}) with WC volume fraction (z) results in an enhanced power
factor ({\alpha}^2{\sigma}) in the composite. The rise in {\sigma} is
attributed to increased carrier mobility in the composite. This is further
established from the work function measurement using the Kelvin probe force
microscopy (KPFM) technique and is also supported by the density functional
theory (DFT) calculations. The difference in elastic properties (sound
velocity) between Ge0.87Mn0.05Sb0.08Te and WC results in a high AIM that leads
to a large interface thermal resistance (Rint) between the phases. The
correlation between Rint and the Kapitza radius results in reduced phonon
thermal conductivity (\kappa_ph) of the composite and is discussed using the
Bruggeman asymmetrical model. The decrease in \kappa_{ph} is further
established using phonon dispersion calculations that indicates the decrease in
phonon group velocity in the composite. The simultaneous effect of enhanced
{\alpha}^2{\sigma} and reduced \kappa_ph results in a maximum figure of merit
(zT) of 1.93 at 773K for (1-z)Ge0.87Mn0.05Sb0.08Te/(z)WC composite having

this paper, we explore the use of output randomization as a defense against

the first defense, we propose output randomization at test time to thwart
finite difference attacks in black box settings. Since this type of attack
relies on repeated queries to the model to estimate gradients, we investigate
the use of randomization to thwart such adversaries from successfully creating
adversarial examples. We empirically show that this defense can limit the
success rate of a black box adversary using the Zeroth Order Optimization
attack to 0%. Secondly, we propose output randomization training as a defense
against white box adversaries. Unlike prior approaches that use randomization,
our defense does not require its use at test time, eliminating the Backward
Pass Differentiable Approximation attack, which was shown to be effective
against other randomization defenses. Additionally, this defense has low
overhead and is easily implemented, allowing it to be used together with other
defenses across various model architectures. We evaluate output randomization
training against the Projected Gradient Descent attacker and show that the
defense can reduce the PGD attack's success rate down to 12% when using
cross-entropy loss.

challenging task in session-based recommendation. Almost all existing works
rely on item transition patterns, and neglect the impact of user historical
sessions while modeling user preference, which often leads to non-personalized
recommendation. Additionally, existing personalized session-based recommenders
capture user preference only based on the sessions of the current user, but
ignore the useful item-transition patterns from other user's historical
sessions. To address these issues, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Global
Graph Neural Networks (HG-GNN) to exploit the item transitions over all
sessions in a subtle manner for better inferring user preference from the
current and historical sessions. To effectively exploit the item transitions
over all sessions from users, we propose a novel heterogeneous global graph
that contains item transitions of sessions, user-item interactions and global
co-occurrence items. Moreover, to capture user preference from sessions
comprehensively, we propose to learn two levels of user representations from
the global graph via two graph augmented preference encoders. Specifically, we
design a novel heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) on the heterogeneous
global graph to learn the long-term user preference and item representations
with rich semantics. Based on the HGNN, we propose the Current Preference
Encoder and the Historical Preference Encoder to capture the different levels
of user preference from the current and historical sessions, respectively. To
achieve personalized recommendation, we integrate the representations of the
user current preference and historical interests to generate the final user
preference representation. Extensive experimental results on three real-world

Poincar\'{e} disc into $\mathbb{CH}^n$ which intertwines two actions of the
fundamental group of a closed surface $\Sigma$: a Fuchsian representation on
the disc and an irreducible action by isometries on $\mathbb{CH}^n$. The moduli
space of these can been studied by relating it to the nilpotent cone in each
moduli space of $PU(n,1)$-Higgs bundles over the conformal surface
corresponding to the map. By providing a necessary condition for points on this
nilpotent cone to be smooth this article shows that away from the points
corresponding to branched minimal immersions or $\pm$-holomorphic immersions
the moduli space is smooth. The argument is easily adapted to show that for
$\mathbb{RH}^n$ the full space of (unbranched) immersions is smooth. For
$\mathbb{CH}^2$ we show the connected components of the moduli space of minimal
immersions are indexed by the Toledo invariant and the Euler number of the
normal bundle of the immersion. This is achieved by studying the limit points
of the $\mathbb{C}^\times$-action on the nilpotent cone. It is shown that the
limit points as $t\to 0$ lead only to branched minimal immersions or
$\pm$-holomorphic immersions. In particular, the Euler number of the normal

effects. Including QED effects does not alter the general structure of
factorization which is analogous for both semi-leptonic and non-leptonic
decays. For the latter, we express our result as a correction of the tree
amplitude coefficient $a_1$. At the amplitude level, we find QED effects at the
sub-percent level, which is of the same order as the QCD uncertainty. We
discuss the phenomenological implications of adding QED effects in light of
discrepancies observed between theory and experimental data, for ratios of
non-leptonic over semi-leptonic decay rates. At the level of the rate,
ultrasoft photon effects can produce a correction up to a few percent,
requiring a careful treatment of such effects in the experimental analyses.

algorithms of edge sampling, edge counting, and triangle counting. Part of our
contribution is that we consider three different settings, differing in the way
in which one may access the neighborhood of a given vertex. In previous work,
people have considered indexed neighbor access, with a query returning the
$i$-th neighbor of a given vertex. Full neighborhood access model, which has a
query that returns the entire neighborhood at a unit cost, has recently been
considered in the applied community. Between these, we propose hash-ordered
neighbor access, inspired by coordinated sampling, where we have a global fully
random hash function, and can access neighbors in order of their hash values,
paying a constant for each accessed neighbor.
  For edge sampling and counting, our new lower bounds are in the most powerful
full neighborhood access model. We provide matching upper bounds in the weaker
hash-ordered neighbor access model. Our new faster algorithms can be provably
implemented efficiently on massive graphs in external memory and with the
current APIs for, e.g., Twitter or Wikipedia. For triangle counting, we provide
a separation: a better upper bound with full neighborhood access than the known
lower bounds with indexed neighbor access. The technical core of our paper is
our edge-sampling algorithm on which the other results depend.

investigates whether it is advisable to recreate an environment in detail by

by combining four graphs to incorporate the instance interaction relation,
local contrast, global contrast, and a high-level semantic prior, respectively.
A novel loss function is also proposed to effectively train the saliency

for this task, aiming at pushing forward this field of research. Finally,
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model is more effective than

necessarily must as well commute with the Hamiltonian. However this need not be
so, nor does that statement do justice to the complete scope and reach of
Noether's first theorem. Rather a much less restrictive statement applies,
namely that the corresponding Noether charge as an observable over phase space
may in fact possess an explicit time dependency, and yet define a constant of
the motion by having a commutator with the Hamiltonian which is nonvanishing,
thus indeed defining a dynamical conserved quantity. Furthermore, and this
certainly within the Hamiltonian formulation, the converse statement is valid
as well, namely that any dynamical constant of motion is necessarily the
Noether charge of some symmetry leaving the system's action invariant up to
some total time derivative contribution. The present contribution revisits

concentrated in perturbations with frequencies smaller than the ion-cyclotron

However, recently unsupervised simultaneous feature learning and clustering
using neural networks also known as Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) has gained
prominence. Pioneering works on deep feature clustering focus on defining
relevant clustering loss function and choosing the right neural network for
extracting features. A central problem in all these cases is data sparsity
accompanied by high intra-class and low inter-class variance, which
subsequently leads to poor clustering performance and erroneous candidate
assignments. Towards this, we employ data augmentation techniques to improve
the density of the clusters, thus improving the overall performance. We train a
variant of Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) with augmented data to construct the
initial feature space as a novel model for deep clustering. We demonstrate the
results of proposed strategy on crowdsourced Indian Heritage dataset. Extensive

decreases from 25.9 {\mu}C/cm2 (Hf0.5Zr0.5O2) to 20.3 {\mu}C/cm2
(Hf0.6Zr0.4O2), the charge trapping behavior decreases, resulting in the slow
degradation rate of memory window (MW) during program/erase cycling; in
addition, when the Ps further decreases to 8.1 {\mu}C/cm2 (Hf0.75Zr0.25O2), the
initial MW nearly disappears (only ~0.02 V). Thus, the reduction of Ps could

to various experimental situations in which the model can be compared. The code
was deposited in the ModelDB repository, and will be under number 266795 after

data is used. In particular, users should have the right to prohibit the use of
their data for training machine learning systems, and to have it erased from
already trained systems. While several sample erasure methods have been
proposed, all of them have drawbacks which have prevented them from gaining
widespread adoption. Most methods are either only applicable to very specific
families of models, sacrifice too much of the original model's accuracy, or
they have prohibitive memory or computational requirements. In this paper, we

modelling the data generating mechanism is a fundamental problem in many

computationally challenging and a fervent area of current research with a
plethora of algorithms being developed. To facilitate the benchmarking of
different methods, we present a novel Snakemake workflow, called Benchpress for
producing scalable, reproducible, and platform-independent benchmarks of
structure learning algorithms for probabilistic graphical models. Benchpress is
interfaced via a simple JSON-file, which makes it accessible for all users,
while the code is designed in a fully modular fashion to enable researchers to
contribute additional methodologies. Benchpress currently provides an interface
to a large number of state-of-the-art algorithms from libraries such as
BDgraph, BiDAG, bnlearn, gCastle, GOBNILP, pcalg, r.blip, scikit-learn, TETRAD,
and trilearn as well as a variety of methods for data generating models and
performance evaluation. Alongside user-defined models and randomly generated
datasets, the workflow also includes a number of standard datasets and
graphical models from the literature, which may be included in a benchmarking
study. We demonstrate the applicability of this workflow for learning Bayesian
networks in five typical data scenarios. The source code and documentation is

associated with the subject, from 2015 to 2021 were selected from five known

while the discipline is still young, the analysis indicated the growing

papers produce either good or excellent result in general, suggesting that PHM
performance is unaffected by XAI. Fourthly, human role, evaluation metrics and
uncertainty management are areas requiring further attention by the PHM

non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum information in many-body systems. Local
information propagates in the system by creating complex correlations known as
information scrambling, as this process prevents extracting the information
from local measurements. In this work, we develop a model adapted from
solid-state NMR methods, to quantify the information scrambling. The scrambling
is measured via time-reversal Loschmidt echoes (LE) and Multiple Quantum
Coherences experiments that intrinsically contain imperfections. Considering
these imperfections, we derive expressions for out-of-time-order correlators
(OTOCs) to quantify the observable information scrambling based on measuring
the number of active spins where the information was spread. Based on the OTOC
expressions, decoherence effects arise naturally by the effects of the
nonreverted terms in the LE experiment. Decoherence induces localization of the
measurable degree of information scrambling. These effects define a
localization cluster size for the observable number of active spins that
determines a dynamical equilibrium. We contrast the model's predictions with
quantum simulations performed with solid-state NMR experiments, that measure
the information scrambling with time-reversal echoes with controlled
imperfections. An excellent quantitative agreement is found with the dynamics
of quantum information scrambling and its localization effects determined from
the experimental data. The presented model and derived OTOCs set tools for
quantifying the quantum information dynamics of large quantum systems (more
than $10^{4}$ spins) consistent with experimental implementations that

Phase transitions with unknown order parameter are rare but extremely
appealing, as they may lead to novel physics. An emblematic, and still
unsolved, example is the transition of the heavy fermion compound URu$_2$Si$_2$
(URS) into the so-called hidden-order (HO) phase when the temperature drops
below $T_0 = 17.5$K. Here we show that the interaction between the heavy
fermion and the conduction band states near the Fermi level has a key role in
the emergence of the HO phase. Using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy,
we find that while the Fermi surfaces of the HO and of a neighboring
antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase of well-defined order parameter have the same
topography, they differ in the size of some, but not all, of their electron
pockets. Such a non-rigid change of the electronic structure indicates that a
change in the interaction strength between states near the Fermi level is a
crucial ingredient for the HO-to-AFM phase transition.

source of impactors smaller than 10 km on Ceres, providing more than half of
the impacts, while the Middle belt is the secondary source. On Vesta, the
relative impactor contribution of the Inner, Middle, and Outer belts is almost
even. We are able to reproduce the craters larger than 100 km in Vesta and
identify two large depressions identified in Ceres as impact craters: one

out to be unexpectedly delicate. We trace the difficulty back to a geometric
obstacle: On a nonsmooth set, there may be sequences of points along which
standard measures of stationarity tend to zero, but whose limit points are not
stationary. We name such events apocalypses, as they can cause optimization
algorithms to converge to non-stationary points. We illustrate this explicitly
for an existing optimization algorithm on bounded-rank matrices. To provably
find stationary points, we modify a trust-region method on a standard smooth
parameterization of the variety. The method relies on the known fact that
second-order stationary points on the parameter space map to stationary points
on the variety. Our geometric observations and proposed algorithm generalize
beyond bounded-rank matrices. We give a geometric characterization of
apocalypses on general constraint sets, which implies that Clarke-regular sets
do not admit apocalypses. Such sets include smooth manifolds, manifolds with
boundaries, and convex sets. Our trust-region method supports parameterization

$(2+1)$-dimensional Poincar\'e group. Here we explain how this can be

reinterpreting the action for the model as a geometric action for BMS$_3$,
where the configuration space variables are elements of the algebra
$\mathfrak{bms}_3$ and the equations of motion transform as coadjoint vectors.
The Poincar\'e subgroup then arises as the stabilizer of the vacuum orbit. This
symmetry breaking is analogous to what happens with the Schwarzian action in
AdS$_2$ JT gravity, although in the present case there is no direct
interpretation in terms of boundary symmetries. This observation, together with
the fact that other lower-dimensional gravitational models (such as the BTZ
black hole) possess the same broken BMS$_3$ symmetries, provides yet another
illustration of the ubiquitous role played by this group.

the beginning of the game, the Dealer holds a deck of $n$ cards (labeled $1,
..., n$). For $n$ turns, the Dealer draws a card from the deck, the Guesser
guesses which card was drawn, and then the card is discarded from the deck. The
Guesser receives a point for each correctly guessed card. With perfect memory,
a Guesser can keep track of all cards that were played so far and pick at
random a card that has not appeared so far, yielding in expectation $\ln n$
correct guesses. With no memory, the best a Guesser can do will result in a
single guess in expectation. We consider the case of a memory bounded Guesser
that has $m < n$ memory bits. We show that the performance of such a memory
bounded Guesser depends much on the behavior of the Dealer. In more detail, we
show that there is a gap between the static case, where the Dealer draws cards
from a properly shuffled deck or a prearranged one, and the adaptive case,
where the Dealer draws cards thoughtfully, in an adversarial manner.
Specifically:
  1. We show a Guesser with $O(\log^2 n)$ memory bits that scores a near
optimal result against any static Dealer.
  2. We show that no Guesser with $m$ bits of memory can score better than
$O(\sqrt{m})$ correct guesses, thus, no Guesser can score better than $\min
\{\sqrt{m}, \ln n\}$, i.e., the above Guesser is optimal.
  3. We show an efficient adaptive Dealer against which no Guesser with $m$
memory bits can make more than $\ln m + 2 \ln \log n + O(1)$ correct guesses in
expectation.
  These results are (almost) tight, and we prove them using compression
arguments that harness the guessing strategy for encoding.

representation of cardiac anatomy, which may contain artefacts caused by
motion. Here we propose a novel latent optimisation framework that jointly
performs motion correction and super resolution for cardiac image

accounts for inter-slice motion in cardiac MR imaging and super-resolves the
input into a high-resolution segmentation consistent with input. A multi-view
loss is incorporated to leverage information from both short-axis view and
long-axis view of cardiac imaging. To solve the inverse problem, iterative
optimisation is performed in a latent space, which ensures the anatomical
plausibility. This alleviates the need of paired low-resolution and

showed that such games admit $\epsilon$-approximate pure Nash equilibria for
certain settings of $\epsilon$ and $\lambda$. They left open, however, the
question of how hard it is to find such an equilibrium. In this work, we
develop a query-efficient reduction from more general games to Lipschitz games.
We use this reduction to show a query lower bound for any randomized algorithm
finding $\epsilon$-approximate pure Nash equilibria of $n$-player,
binary-action, $\lambda$-Lipschitz games that is exponential in
$\frac{n\lambda}{\epsilon}$. In addition, we introduce ``Multi-Lipschitz
games,'' a generalization involving player-specific Lipschitz values, and
provide a reduction from finding equilibria of these games to finding
equilibria of Lipschitz games, showing that the value of interest is the sum of
the individual Lipschitz parameters. Finally, we provide an exponential lower
bound on the deterministic query complexity of finding $\epsilon$-approximate
correlated equilibria of $n$-player, $m$-action, $\lambda$-Lipschitz games for
strong values of $\epsilon$, motivating the consideration of explicitly

weights in overparameterized networks. Most of the existing techniques first
remove structured sub-networks (filters, channels,...) and then fine-tune the
resulting networks to maintain a high accuracy. However, removing a whole
structure is a strong topological prior and recovering the accuracy, with
fine-tuning, is highly cumbersome. In this paper, we introduce an ""end-to-end""
lightweight network design that achieves training and pruning simultaneously
without fine-tuning. The design principle of our method relies on
reparametrization that learns not only the weights but also the topological
structure of the lightweight sub-network. This reparametrization acts as a
prior (or regularizer) that defines pruning masks implicitly from the weights
of the underlying network, without increasing the number of training
parameters. Sparsity is induced with a budget loss that provides an accurate

exploration. In this paper, we consider the problem of daily prediction of
Solar Proton Events (SPEs) based on the characteristics of the magnetic fields
in solar Active Regions (ARs), preceding soft X-ray and proton fluxes, and
statistics of solar radio bursts. The machine learning (ML) algorithm uses an
artificial neural network of custom architecture designed for whole-Sun input.
The predictions of the ML model are compared with the SWPC NOAA operational
forecasts of SPEs. Our preliminary results indicate that 1) for the AR-based
predictions, it is necessary to take into account ARs at the western limb and
on the far side of the Sun; 2) characteristics of the preceding proton flux
represent the most valuable input for prediction; 3) daily median
characteristics of ARs and the counts of type II, III, and IV radio bursts may
be excluded from the forecast without performance loss; and 4) ML-based
forecasts outperform SWPC NOAA forecasts in situations in which missing SPE
events is very undesirable. The introduced approach indicates the possibility
of developing robust ""all-clear"" SPE forecasts by employing machine learning

information. In the classical Two-Choice process a ball first queries the load
of two randomly chosen bins and is then placed in the least loaded bin. In our
setting, each ball also samples two random bins but can only estimate a bin's
load by sending binary queries of the form ""Is the load at least the median?""
or ""Is the load at least 100?"".
  For the lightly loaded case $m=O(n)$, Feldheim and Gurel-Gurevich (2021)
showed that with one query it is possible to achieve a maximum load of
$O(\sqrt{\log n/\log \log n})$, and posed the question whether a maximum load
of $m/n+O(\sqrt{\log n/\log \log n})$ is possible for any $m = \Omega(n)$. In
this work, we resolve this open problem by proving a lower bound of
$m/n+\Omega( \sqrt{\log n})$ for a fixed $m=\Theta(n \sqrt{\log n})$, and a
lower bound of $m/n+\Omega(\log n/\log \log n)$ for some $m$ depending on the
used strategy.
  We complement this negative result by proving a positive result for multiple
queries. In particular, we show that with only two binary queries per chosen
bin, there is an oblivious strategy which ensures a maximum load of
$m/n+O(\sqrt{\log n})$ for any $m \geq 1$. Further, for any number of $k =
O(\log \log n)$ binary queries, the upper bound on the maximum load improves to
$m/n + O(k(\log n)^{1/k})$ for any $m \geq 1$.
  Further, this result for $k$ queries implies (i) new bounds for the
$(1+\beta)$-process introduced by Peres et al (2015), (ii) new bounds for the
graphical balanced allocation process on dense expander graphs, and (iii) the
bound of $m/n+O(\log \log n)$ on the maximum load achieved by the Two-Choice
process, including the heavily loaded case $m=\Omega(n)$ derived by Berenbrink
et al. (2006). One novel aspect of our proofs is the use of multiple
super-exponential potential functions, which might be of use in future work.

  Poisoning","Neurips 2021",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables cross-domain learning without
target domain labels by transferring knowledge from a labeled source domain
whose distribution differs from that of the target. However, UDA is not always
successful and several accounts of `negative transfer' have been reported in
the literature. In this work, we prove a simple lower bound on the target
domain error that complements the existing upper bound. Our bound shows the
insufficiency of minimizing source domain error and marginal distribution
mismatch for a guaranteed reduction in the target domain error, due to the
possible increase of induced labeling function mismatch. This insufficiency is
further illustrated through simple distributions for which the same UDA
approach succeeds, fails, and may succeed or fail with an equal chance.
Motivated from this, we propose novel data poisoning attacks to fool UDA
methods into learning representations that produce large target domain errors.
We evaluate the effect of these attacks on popular UDA methods using benchmark
datasets where they have been previously shown to be successful. Our results
show that poisoning can significantly decrease the target domain accuracy,
dropping it to almost 0% in some cases, with the addition of only 10% poisoned
data in the source domain. The failure of these UDA methods demonstrates their
limitations at guaranteeing cross-domain generalization consistent with our
lower bound. Thus, evaluating UDA methods in adversarial settings such as data
poisoning provides a better sense of their robustness to data distributions
unfavorable for UDA.

the hemodynamic effects of stent-graft introducer sheath during TEVAR. Three
idealized representative diseased aortas of aortic aneurysm, coarctation of the

studies were performed in the above idealized aortic geometries. An introducer
sheath routinely used in the clinic was virtually-delivered into diseased
aortas. Comparative analysis was carried out to evaluate the hemodynamic
effects of the introducer sheath. Results show that the blood flow to the
supra-aortic branches would increase above 9% due to the obstruction of the
introducer sheath. The region exposed to high endothelial cell activation
potential (ECAP) expands in the scenarios of coarctation of the aorta and
aortic dissection, which indicates that the probability of thrombus formation
may increase during TEVAR. The pressure magnitude in peak systole shows an
obvious rise and a similar phenomenon is not observed in early diastole. The
blood viscosity in the aortic arch and descending aorta is remarkably altered
by the introducer sheath. The uneven viscosity distribution confirms the
necessity of using non-Newtonian models and high viscosity region with high
ECAP further promotes thrombosis. Our results highlight the hemodynamic effects

generalizable and require the calibration of a number of parameters to fit
experimental data. However, inherent pitfalls stemming from the restriction to
a specific functional form include poor fits to the data, non-uniqueness of
fit, and high sensitivity to parameters. In this study we design and train
fully connected neural networks as material models to replace or augment expert
models. To guarantee objectivity, the neural network takes isochoric strain
invariants as inputs, and outputs the value of strain energy and its
derivatives with respect to the invariants. Convexity of the material model is
enforced through the loss function. Direct prediction of the derivative
functions -- rather than just predicting the energy -- serves two purposes: it
provides flexibility during training, and it enables the calculation of the
elasticity tensor through back-propagation. We showcase the ability of the
neural network to learn the mechanical behavior of porcine and murine skin from
biaxial test data. Crucially, we show that a multi-fidelity scheme which
combines high fidelity experimental data with low fidelity analytical data
yields the best performance. The neural network material model can then be
interpreted as the best extension of an expert model: it learns the features
that an expert has encoded in the analytical model while fitting the
experimental data better. Finally, we implemented a general user material
subroutine (UMAT) for the finite element software Abaqus and thereby make our
advances available to the broader computational community. We expect that the
methods and software generated in this work will broaden the use of data-driven

However, due to the many parameter combinations, an incomplete or an
insufficient procedure is often applied. This situation may cause misleading or
confusing conclusions. In this opinion paper, through an intriguing example we
point out that the seriousness goes beyond what is generally recognized. In the
topic of multi-label classification for medical code prediction, one
influential paper conducted a proper parameter selection on a set, but when
moving to a subset of frequently occurring labels, the authors used the same
parameters without a separate tuning. The set of frequent labels became a
popular benchmark in subsequent studies, which kept pushing the state of the
art. However, we discovered that most of the results in these studies cannot
surpass the approach in the original paper if a parameter tuning had been
conducted at the time. Thus it is unclear how much progress the subsequent
developments have actually brought. The lesson clearly indicates that without
enough attention on parameter selection, the research progress in our field can
be uncertain or even illusive.

poor quality of images, automatic labelling based on key word search etc. Such
noisy annotations impede the performance of FER due to the memorization ability
of deep networks. During early learning stage, deep networks fit on clean data.
Then, eventually, they start overfitting on noisy labels due to their
memorization ability, which limits FER performance. This report presents
Consensual Collaborative Training (CCT) framework used in our submission to
expression recognition track of the Affective Behaviour Analysis in-the-wild
(ABAW) 2021 competition. CCT co-trains three networks jointly using a convex
combination of supervision loss and consistency loss, without making any
assumption about the noise distribution. A dynamic transition mechanism is used
to move from supervision loss in early learning to consistency loss for
consensus of predictions among networks in the later stage. Co-training reduces
overall error, and consistency loss prevents overfitting to noisy samples. The
performance of the model is validated on challenging Aff-Wild2 dataset for
categorical expression classification. Our code is made publicly available at

engineering fields. Inspired by the principle that a representative model is
the one simplest possible, a new model selection criteria considering both
model's Parsimony and Sparsity is proposed. A Parsimony Enhanced Sparse
Bayesian Learning (PeSBL) method is developed for discovering the governing
Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) of nonlinear dynamical systems. Compared
with the conventional Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) method, the PeSBL method
promotes parsimony of the learned model in addition to its sparsity. In this
method, the parsimony of model terms is evaluated using their locations in the
prescribed candidate library, for the first time, considering the increased
complexity with the power of polynomials and the order of spatial derivatives.
Subsequently, the model parameters are updated through Bayesian inference with
the raw data. This procedure aims to reduce the error associated with the
possible loss of information in data preprocessing and numerical
differentiation prior to sparse regression. Results of numerical case studies
indicate that the governing PDEs of many canonical dynamical systems can be
correctly identified using the proposed PeSBL method from highly noisy data (up
to 50% in the current study). Next, the proposed methodology is extended for
stochastic PDE learning where all parameters and modeling error are considered
as random variables. Hierarchical Bayesian Inference (HBI) is integrated with
the proposed framework for stochastic PDE learning from a population of
observations. Finally, the proposed PeSBL is demonstrated for system response
prediction with uncertainties and anomaly diagnosis. Codes of all demonstrated
examples in this study are available on the website: https://github.com/ymlasu.

practice this often means identifying a constant known as the doubling time,
describing the time period over which the technology roughly doubles in some
measure of performance or of performance per dollar. Moore's law is,
classically, the empirical observation that the number of electronic components
that can be put on a chip doubles every 18 months to 2 years. Today it is
frequently stated as the number of computations available per unit of cost.
Generalized to the appropriate doubling time, it describes the rate of
advancement in many technologies. A frequently noted competitor to Moore's law
is known as Wright's law, which has aeronautical roots. Wright's law (also
called power law, experience curve and Henderson's law) relates some quality of
a manufactured unit (for Wright, airplanes) to the volume of units
manufactured. The Wright's law equation expresses the idea that performance -
price or a quality metric - improves according to a power of the number
produced, or alternatively stated, improves by a constant percentage for every
doubling of the total number produced.
  Does exploration of outer space conform to Moore's law or Wright's law-like
behavior? Our results below are broadly consistent with these laws. This is
true for many technologies. Although the two laws can make somewhat different
predictions, Sahal found that they converge to the same predictions when
manufacturing volume increases exponentially over time. When space exploration
transitions into an independent commercial sector, as many people hope and
expect, spacecraft technology will then likely enter an era of unambiguously
exponential advancement.

appearance, while minimizing the number of bits needed to transmit it. However,
the amount of information actually needed by a user for downstream tasks --
e.g., deciding which product to click on in a shopping website -- is likely
much lower. To achieve this lower bitrate, we would ideally only transmit the
visual features that drive user behavior, while discarding details irrelevant
to the user's decisions. We approach this problem by training a compression
model through human-in-the-loop learning as the user performs tasks with the
compressed images. The key insight is to train the model to produce a
compressed image that induces the user to take the same action that they would
have taken had they seen the original image. To approximate the loss function
for this model, we train a discriminator that tries to distinguish whether a
user's action was taken in response to the compressed image or the original. We
evaluate our method through experiments with human participants on four tasks:
reading handwritten digits, verifying photos of faces, browsing an online
shopping catalogue, and playing a car racing video game. The results show that
our method learns to match the user's actions with and without compression at
lower bitrates than baseline methods, and adapts the compression model to the
user's behavior: it preserves the digit number and randomizes handwriting style
in the digit reading task, preserves hats and eyeglasses while randomizing
faces in the photo verification task, preserves the perceived price of an item
while randomizing its color and background in the online shopping task, and
preserves upcoming bends in the road in the car racing game.

health. It kills one child every 30 seconds and over one million people
annually. If diagnosed in a timely manner, however, most people can be
effectively treated with antimalarial therapy. Several deaths due to malaria
are byproducts of disparities in the social determinants of health; the current
gold standard for diagnosing malaria requires microscopes, reagents, and other
equipment that most patients of low socioeconomic brackets do not have access
to. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture
that allows for rapid automated diagnosis of malaria (achieving a high
classification accuracy of 98%), as well as a deep neural network (DNN) based
three-dimensional (3D) modeling algorithm that renders 3D models of parasitic
cells in augmented reality (AR). This creates an opportunity to optimize the
current workflow for malaria diagnosis and demonstrates potential for deep
learning models to improve telemedicine practices and patient health literacy
on a global scale.

1951-1953 -- has in recent years emerged into a fashionable subject in
theoretical physics, now usually with the name of the Einstein-Dirac ether. It
means that one special inertial frame is singled out, as the ""rest frame"". What
is emphasized in the present note, is that the idea is a natural example of the
covariant theory of quantum electrodynamics in media if the refractive index is
set equal to unity. A treatise on this case of quantum electrodynamics was
given by the present author back in 1971, published then only within a preprint
series. The present version is a brief summary of that formalism, with a link
to the original paper. We think it is one of the first treatises on modern
ether theory.
