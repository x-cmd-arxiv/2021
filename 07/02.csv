A common framework is to train a descattering network for image recovery by
removing scattering artifacts. To achieve the best results on a broad spectrum
of scattering conditions, individual ""expert"" networks need to be trained for
each condition. However, the expert's performance sharply degrades when the
testing condition differs from the training. An alternative brute-force
approach is to train a ""generalist"" network using data from diverse scattering
conditions. It generally requires a larger network to encapsulate the diversity
in the data and a sufficiently large training set to avoid overfitting. Here,
we propose an adaptive learning framework, termed dynamic synthesis network
(DSN), which dynamically adjusts the model weights and adapts to different
scattering conditions. The adaptability is achieved by a novel ""mixture of
experts"" architecture that enables dynamically synthesizing a network by
blending multiple experts using a gating network. We demonstrate the DSN in
holographic 3D particle imaging for a variety of scattering conditions. We show
in simulation that our DSN provides generalization across a continuum of
scattering conditions. In addition, we show that by training the DSN entirely
on simulated data, the network can generalize to experiments and achieve robust
3D descattering. We expect the same concept can find many other applications,
such as denoising and imaging in scattering media. Broadly, our dynamic
synthesis framework opens up a new paradigm for designing highly adaptive deep
learning and computational imaging techniques.

proposed that asserts to bypass the Lovelock's theorem and to result in a
non-trivial contribution to the gravitational dynamics in four-dimensional
spacetime. In this work, we study the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect in
the 4D EGB model. For this purpose, we calculate the evolution of the
gravitational potential and the linear growth factor as a function of redshift
for the 4D EGB model and compare it with the corresponding result obtained from
the $\Lambda$-cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. We also calculate the
ISW-auto power spectrum and the ISW-cross power spectrum as functions of cosmic
microwave background (CMB) multipoles for the 4D EGB model and compare those
with the one obtained from the $\Lambda$CDM model. To do this, we use the
strongest constraint on the coupling parameter proposed for the 4D EGB model.
Additionally, to calculate the ISW effect for the 4D EGB model, we employ three
large-scale structure surveys from different wavelengths. The results exhibit
that the ISW effect in the 4D EGB model is higher than the one obtained from
the $\Lambda$CDM model. Hence, we show that the 4D EGB model can amplify the
amplitude of the ISW power spectrum, which can be considered as a relative
advantage of the 4D EGB model comparing the $\Lambda$CDM one. Also, we indicate
that the deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model is directly proportional to the
value of the dimensionless coupling parameter $\beta$.

provide informations about the system with minimal back action. Weak values of
product observables (commuting) or higher moments of an observable are
informationally important in the sense that they are useful to resolve some
paradoxes, realize strange quantum effects, reconstruct density matrices, etc.
In this work, we show that it is possible to access the higher moment weak
values of an observable using weak values of that observable with pairwise
orthogonal post-selections. Although the higher moment weak values of an
observable are inaccessible with Gaussian pointer states, our method allows any
pointer state. We have calculated product weak values in a bipartite system for
any given pure and mixed pre selected states. Such product weak values can be
obtained using only the measurements of local weak values (which are defined as
single system weak values in a multi-partite system). As an application, we use
higher moment weak values and product weak values to reconstruct unknown
quantum states of single and bipartite systems, respectively. Further, we give
a necessary separability criteria for finite dimensional systems using product
weak values and certain class of entangled states violate this inequality by
cleverly choosing the product observables and the post selections. By such
choices, positive partial transpose (PPT) criteria can be achieved for these
classes of entangled states. Robustness of our method which occurs due to
inappropriate choices of quantum observables and noisy post-selections is also
discussed here. Our method can easily be generalized to the multi-partite
systems.

exploding granules using data taken with the Interferometric Bidimensional

simulations. We found that exploding granules have significantly longer
lifetimes than regular granules. Exploding granules larger than 3.8 arcsec form
an independent intergranular lane during their decay phase, while smaller
granules usually fade away or disappear into the intergranular area. For all

interactions. Analysis of the available lattice results suggests the presence
of both the extra states in the baryon-strangeness sector and the repulsive
baryonic interaction, with indications that hyperons have a smaller repulsive
core than non-strange baryons. The modified hadron resonance gas model
presented here significantly improves the description of lattice QCD
susceptibilities at chemical freeze-out and can be used for the analysis of
event-by-event fluctuations in heavy-ion collisions.

the individually classified maps of the multitemporal data set. Due to varying
acquisition conditions (e.g., illumination, sensors, seasonal differences), the
classification maps yielded are often inconsistent through time for robust
statistical analysis. 3D geometric features have been shown to be stable for
assessing differences across the temporal data set. Therefore, in this article
we investigate he use of a multitemporal orthophoto and digital surface model
derived from satellite data for spatiotemporal classification. Our approach
consists of two major steps: generating per-class probability distribution maps
using the random-forest classifier with limited training samples, and making
spatiotemporal inferences using an iterative 3D spatiotemporal filter operating
on per-class probability maps. Our experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed methods can consistently improve the individual classification results
by 2%-6% and thus can be an important postclassification refinement approach.

a balanced replay scheme that prioritizes samples encountered online while also
encouraging the use of near-on-policy samples from the offline dataset.
Furthermore, we leverage multiple Q-functions trained pessimistically offline,

turns out, learning to predict such features (a.k.a pseudo-labels) has proven
to be a particularly relevant pretext task, leading to useful self-supervised

methods and common practices for combining such pretext tasks for better

calibrated weights for the partial losses corresponding to the considered
pretext tasks during the self-supervised training process. The experiments
conducted on automatic speech recognition, speaker and emotion recognition

discs are gravitationally coupled to the halo, we conduct simulations of
idealized models of disc galaxies. We compare growth rates of spiral
instabilities in identical mass models in which the halo is held rigid or is
represented by particles drawn from an equilibrium distribution function. We
examine cases of radial and azimuthal bias in the halo velocity ellipsoid in
one of our models, and an isotropic velocity distribution in both. We find at
most marginal evidence for an enhanced growth rate of spiral modes caused by a
halo supporting response. We also find evidence for very mild dynamical
friction between the spiral disturbance and the halo. We offer an explanation
to account for the different behaviour between spiral modes and bar modes,
since earlier work had found that bar instabilities became significantly more
vigorous when a responsive halo was substituted for an equivalent rigid mass
distribution. The barely significant differences found here justify the usual
simplifying approximation of a rigid halo made in studies of spiral

frequency band 20-2000\,Hz and with a frequency time derivative in the range of
$[-1.0, +0.1]\times10^{-8}$\,Hz/s. Such a signal could be produced by a nearby,
spinning and slightly non-axisymmetric isolated neutron star in our galaxy.
This search uses the LIGO data from the first six months of Advanced LIGO's and
Advanced Virgo's third observational run, O3. No periodic gravitational wave
signals are observed, and 95\%\ confidence-level (CL) frequentist upper limits
are placed on their strengths. The lowest upper limits on worst-case (linearly
polarized) strain amplitude $h_0$ are $~1.7\times10^{-25}$ near 200\,Hz. For a
circularly polarized source (most favorable orientation), the lowest upper
limits are $\sim6.3\times10^{-26}$. These strict frequentist upper limits refer
to all sky locations and the entire range of frequency derivative values. For a
population-averaged ensemble of sky locations and stellar orientations, the
lowest 95\%\ CL upper limits on the strain amplitude are
$\sim1.\times10^{-25}$. These upper limits improve upon our previously
published all-sky results, with the greatest improvement (factor of $\sim$2)
seen at higher frequencies, in part because quantum squeezing has dramatically
improved the detector noise level relative to the second observational run, O2.
These limits are the most constraining to date over most of the parameter space
searched.

  optimization",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider mixed-integer nonsmooth constrained optimization
problems whose objective/constraint functions are available only as the output
of a black-box zeroth-order oracle (i.e., an oracle that does not provide
derivative information) and we propose a new derivative-free linesearch-based
algorithmic framework to suitably handle those problems. We first describe a
scheme for bound constrained problems that combines a dense sequence of
directions (to handle the nonsmoothness of the objective function) with
primitive directions (to handle discrete variables). Then, we embed an exact
penalty approach in the scheme to suitably manage nonlinear (possibly
nonsmooth) constraints. We analyze the global convergence properties of the
proposed algorithms toward stationary points and we report the results of an
extensive numerical experience on a set of mixed-integer test problems.

stochastic optimization problems in multi-dimensional discrete or continuous
spaces. ADP approximates the optimal value function by adaptively sampling both
action and state space. It provides a tractable approach to very large
problems, but can suffer from the exploration-exploitation dilemma. We propose
a novel approach for selecting actions using importance sampling weighted by
the value function approximation in continuous decision spaces to address this
dilemma. An advantage of this approach is it balances exploration and
exploitation without any tuning parameters when sampling actions compared to
other exploration approaches such as Epsilon Greedy, instead relying only on
the approximate value function. We compare the proposed algorithm with other
exploration strategies in continuous action space in the context of a
multi-stage generation expansion planning problem under uncertainty.

differential game of $N$-players whose state dynamics are subject to
idiosyncratic and common noise and that can be absorbed when they hit a
prescribed region of the state space. We provide a general result for the
existence of weak mean field equilibria which, due to the absorption and the
common noise, are given by random flow of sub-probabilities. We first use a
fixed point argument to find solutions to the mean field problem in a reduced
setting resulting from a discretization procedure and then we prove convergence
of such equilibria to the desired solution. We exploit these ideas also to
construct $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibria for the $N$-player game. Since the
approximation is two-fold, one given by the mean field limit and one given by
the discretization, some suitable convergence results are needed. We also
introduce and discuss a novel model of bank run that can be studied within this
framework.

providing dedicated virtual networks tailored to the specific service/business

supporting the needs of different industry verticals by moving computing
facilities to the network edge. NS can be constructed by instantiating a set of
virtual network functions (VNFs) on top of MEC cloud servers for provisioning
diverse latency-sensitive communication services (e.g., autonomous driving and
augmented reality) on demand at a lesser cost and time. However, VNFs, MEC
cloud servers, and communication links are subject to failures due to software
bugs, misconfiguration, overloading, hardware faults, cyber attacks, power
outage, and natural/man-made disaster. Failure of a critical network component
disrupts services abruptly and leads to users' dissatisfaction, which may
result in revenue loss for the NOs. In this paper, we present a novel approach
based on multi-connectivity in 5G networks to tackle this problem and our
proposed approach is resilient against i) failure of VNFs, ii) failure of local
servers within MEC, iii) failure of communication links, and iv) failure of an

problem as a binary integer programming (BIP) model in order to optimally
deploy NSs with the minimum cost, and prove it is NP-hard. To overcome time
complexity, we propose an efficient genetic algorithm based heuristic to obtain
near-optimal solution in polynomial time. By extensive simulations, we show
that our proposed approach not only reduces resource wastage, but also improves

property of convolutional networks, showing that small shifts in the input can
affect the output predictions substantially. In this paper, we analyze the
benefits of addressing lack of shift invariance in CNN-based sound event
classification. Specifically, we evaluate two pooling methods to improve shift
invariance in CNNs, based on low-pass filtering and adaptive sampling of
incoming feature maps. These methods are implemented via small architectural
modifications inserted into the pooling layers of CNNs. We evaluate the effect
of these architectural changes on the FSD50K dataset using models of different
capacity and in presence of strong regularization. We show that these
modifications consistently improve sound event classification in all cases
considered. We also demonstrate empirically that the proposed pooling methods
increase shift invariance in the network, making it more robust against
time/frequency shifts in input spectrograms. This is achieved by adding a

fundamentally important for understanding the chemical reactions in LIBs and
developing proper thermal management strategies. However, the direct
measurements of reversible heat are challenging due to the limited temperature
resolution of applied thermometry. In this work, by developing an
ultra-sensitive thermometry with a differential AC bridge using two
thermistors, the noise-equivalent temperature resolution we achieve (10 uK) is
several orders of magnitude higher than previous thermometry applied on LIBs.
We directly observe reversible heat absorption of a LIR2032 coin cell during
charging with negligible irreversible heat generation and a linear relation
between heat generations and discharging currents. The cell entropy changes
determined from the reversible heat agree excellently with those measured from
temperature dependent open circuit voltage. Moreover, it is found that the
large reversible entropy change can cancel out the irreversible entropy
generation at a charging rate as large as C/3.7 and produce a
zero-heat-dissipation LIB during charging. Our work significantly contributes
to fundamental understanding of the entropy changes and heat generations of the
chemical reactions in LIBs, and reveals that reversible heat absorption can be
an effective way to cool LIBs during charging.

the continuous-time VLB is invariant to the noise schedule, except for the
signal-to-noise ratio at its endpoints. This enables us to learn a noise
schedule that minimizes the variance of the resulting VLB estimator, leading to
faster optimization. Combining these advances with architectural improvements,
we obtain state-of-the-art likelihoods on image density estimation benchmarks,
outperforming autoregressive models that have dominated these benchmarks for
many years, with often significantly faster optimization. In addition, we show

either transforms the process in order to achieve a distribution-free limit or
approximates the non-distribution free limit using a numerical or a re-sampling
technique. Here the three solutions will be considered.It is shown that the
proposed tests have nontrivial power against a class of root-n local
alternatives, and are suitable when the conditioning information set is
infinite-dimensional, which allows including models like autoregressive
conditional heteroscedastic stochastic models with dependent innovations. The
approach presented assumes only certain conditions on the first- and
second-order conditional moments, without imposing any autoregression model.
The test procedures introduced are compared with each other and with other
competitors in terms of their power using a simulation study and a real data
application. These simulations have shown that the statistical powers of tests
based on re-sampling or numerical approximation of the original statistics are
in general slightly better than those based on a martingale transformation of

extended to the online variants for streaming automatic speech recognition

large label emission latency because of the unconstrained end-to-end training
objective. Previous works tackled this problem by leveraging alignment
information to control the timing to emit tokens during training. In this work,
we propose a simple alignment-free regularization method, StableEmit, to
encourage MoChA to emit tokens earlier. StableEmit discounts the selection
probabilities in hard monotonic attention for token boundary detection by a
constant factor and regularizes them to recover the total attention mass during
training. As a result, the scale of the selection probabilities is increased,
and the values can reach a threshold for token emission earlier, leading to a
reduction of emission latency and deletion errors. Moreover, StableEmit can be
combined with methods that constraint alignments to further improve the
accuracy and latency. Experimental evaluations with LSTM and Conformer encoders
demonstrate that StableEmit significantly reduces the recognition errors and
the emission latency simultaneously. We also show that the use of alignment
information is complementary in both metrics.

were trained and validated on, posing a challenge to practitioners who wish to
predict how well the deployed model will perform on a target distribution. If
an unlabeled sample from the target distribution is available, along with a
labeled sample from a possibly different source distribution, standard
approaches such as importance weighting can be applied to estimate performance
on the target. However, importance weighting struggles when the source and
target distributions have non-overlapping support or are high-dimensional.
Taking inspiration from fields such as epidemiology and polling, we develop
Mandoline, a new evaluation framework that mitigates these issues. Our key
insight is that practitioners may have prior knowledge about the ways in which
the distribution shifts, which we can use to better guide the importance
weighting procedure. Specifically, users write simple ""slicing functions"" -
noisy, potentially correlated binary functions intended to capture possible
axes of distribution shift - to compute reweighted performance estimates. We
further describe a density ratio estimation framework for the slices and show
how its estimation error scales with slice quality and dataset size. Empirical
validation on NLP and vision tasks shows that Mandoline can estimate
performance on the target distribution up to 3x more accurately compared to
standard baselines.

until now only one gravitationally lensed star has been resolved. The future
telescopes will resolve very small lensing signatures for stars orbiting the
supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the center of the Milky Way. The lensing
signatures should however be easier to detect for background stars. We predict
that ELT, TMT, and GMT will resolve the lensed images of around 100 (60) stars
in the disk and 30 (20) stars in the bulge in the background of the SMBH, down
to 28 (27) mag (Vega) limits at K-band, requiring 5 (1) hr of integration. In
order to detect several such stars one needs the limit of at least 24 mag. With
a decade-long monitoring one can also detect the rotation of the lensed images.
The detection of elongated images will not be possible, because this would
require a nearly perfect source-lens alignment. JWST will likely be limited by
the confusion caused by stars near the Galactic center. The detection of such
lensed images will provide a very clean test of general relativity, when
combined with the SMBH mass measurement from orbital motions of stars, and
accurate measurements of the SMBH properties, because both the source and the

frustrated quantum magnets and feature fractionalized excitations and emergent
gauge fields. Here, we consider a gapless U(1) spin liquid with spinon Fermi
pockets in two spatial dimensions. Such a state appears to be the most
promising candidate to describe the exotic field-induced behavior observed in
numerical simulations of the antiferromagnetic Kitaev honeycomb model. A
similar such state may also be responsible for the recently-reported quantum
oscillations of the thermal conductivity in the field-induced quantum
paramagnetic phase of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. We consider the regime close to a
Lifshitz transition, at which the spinon Fermi pockets shrink to small circles
around high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. By employing renormalization
group and mean-field arguments, we demonstrate that interactions lead to a gap
opening in the spinon spectrum at low temperatures, which can be understood as
a nesting instability of the spinon Fermi surface. This leads to proliferation
of monopole operators of the emergent U(1) gauge field and confinement of
spinons. While signatures of fractionalization may be observable at finite
temperatures, the gapless U(1) spin liquid state with nested spinon Fermi
pockets is ultimately unstable at low temperatures towards a conventional
long-range-ordered ground state, such as a valence bond solid. Implications for
Kitaev materials in external magnetic fields are discussed.

asymmetric, showing an increase in brightness near mid-eclipse, likely due to
rotational variability that is too low amplitude to be observed out-of-eclipse.

and observables of an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy. We model the evolution of a
low-mass ($\approx 8 \, \times \, 10^{8} \, \rm M_{\odot}$) dark matter halo
with cosmological, zoomed hydrodynamical simulations capable of resolving
individual supernovae explosions, which we complement with an empirically
motivated subgrid prescription for systematic IMF variations. In this
framework, at the low gas metallicities typical of faint dwarfs, the IMF of
newborn stellar populations becomes top-heavy, increasing the efficiency of
supernova and photoionization feedback in regulating star formation. This
results in a 100-fold reduction of the final stellar mass of the dwarf compared
to a canonical IMF, at fixed dynamical mass. The increase in the feedback
budget is nonetheless met by increased metal production from more numerous
massive stars, leading to nearly constant iron content at $z=0$. A
metallicity-dependent IMF therefore provides a mechanism to produce low-mass
($\rm M_{\star}\sim 10^3 \rm M_{\odot}$), yet enriched ($\rm [Fe/H]\approx -2$)
field dwarf galaxies, thus opening a self-consistent avenue to populate the
plateau in $\rm [Fe/H]$ at the faintest end of the mass--metallicity relation.

to revolutionize ground-based astronomy by greatly reducing the cost of
collecting area. In this paper, we introduce a new class of large telescope
based on these advances: an all-sky, arcsecond-resolution, 1000-telescope array
which builds a simultaneously high-cadence and deep survey by observing the
entire sky all night. As a concrete example, we describe the Argus Array, a
5m-class telescope with an all-sky field of view and the ability to reach
extremely high cadences using low-noise CMOS detectors. Each 55 GPix Argus
exposure covers 20% of the entire sky to g=19.6 each minute and g=21.9 each
hour; a high-speed mode will allow sub-second survey cadences for short times.
Deep coadds will reach g=23.6 every five nights over 47% of the sky; a
larger-aperture array telescope, with an \'etendue close to the Rubin
Observatory, could reach g=24.3 in five nights. These arrays can build
two-color, million-epoch movies of the sky, enabling sensitive and rapid
searches for high-speed transients, fast-radio-burst counterparts,
gravitational-wave counterparts, exoplanet microlensing events, occultations by
distant solar system bodies, and myriad other phenomena. An array of O(1,000)
telescopes, however, would be one of the most complex astronomical instruments
yet built. Standard arrays with hundreds of tracking mounts entail thousands of
moving parts and exposed optics, and maintenance costs would rapidly outpace
the mass-produced-hardware cost savings compared to a monolithic large
telescope. We discuss how to greatly reduce operations costs by placing all
optics in a thermally controlled, sealed dome with a single moving part.
Coupled with careful software scope control and use of existing pipelines, we
show that the Argus Array could become the deepest and fastest Northern sky
survey, with total costs below $20M.

physics processes within and beyond the standard model (SM). One of the
ultimate rare processes in the SM currently being explored at the LHC, $pp\to
t\bar tt \bar t$ with its large multi-dimensional phase-space is an ideal
testing ground to explore new ways to reduce the impact of potential MC

capable of disentangling the 4-top signal from the dominant backgrounds in the
same-sign dilepton channel, while simultaneously correcting for possible MC
imperfections in modelling of the most relevant discriminating observables --
the jet multiplicity distributions. A Bayesian mixture of multinomials is used
to model the light-jet and $b$-jet multiplicities under the assumption of their
conditional independence. The signal and background distributions generated
from a deliberately mistuned MC simulator are used as model priors. The
posterior distributions, as well as the signal and background fractions, are
then learned from the data using Bayesian inference. We demonstrate that our
method can mitigate the effects of large MC mismodellings in the context of a
realistic $t\bar tt\bar t$ search, leading to corrected posterior distributions

The ontology of RQM thereby strives to uphold the universality and completeness

allowing for the metric to be reparameterised along the RG flow, such that only
the essential couplings constants are renormalised. This allows us to identify
a universality class of quantum gravity which is guaranteed to be unitary,
since the physical degrees of freedom are those of general relativity without
matter and with a vanishing cosmological constant. Considering all
diffeomorphism invariant operators with up to four derivatives, only Newton's
constant is essential at the Gaussian infrared fixed point associated to the
linearised Einstein--Hilbert action. The other inessential couplings can then
be fixed to the values they take at the Gaussian fixed point along the RG flow
within this universality class. In the ultraviolet, the corresponding beta
function for Newton's constant vanishes at the interacting Reuter fixed point.
The properties of the Reuter fixed point are stable between the
Einstein--Hilbert approximation and the approximation including all
diffeomorphism invariant four derivative terms in the flow equation. Our
results suggest that Newton's constant is the only relevant essential coupling
at the Reuter fixed point. Therefore, we conjecture that quantum Einstein
gravity, the ultraviolet completion of Einstein's theory of general relativity
in the asymptotic safety scenario, has no free parameters in the absence of
matter and in particular predicts a vanishing cosmological constant.

49 galaxies with high signal-to-noise (SNR) spectra and redshifts between 1.3 <
z < 1.5, where H-alpha emission is observed along with [OIII] and [OII]. With
accurate measurements of SFR in these objects, we confirm the existence of a
mass-metallicity-SFR (M-Z-SFR) relation at high redshifts. These galaxies show
systematic differences from the local M-Z-SFR relation, which vary depending on
the adopted measurement of the local relation. However, it remains difficult to
ascertain whether these differences could be due to redshift evolution, as the
local M-Z-SFR relation is poorly constrained at the masses and SFRs of our

out-of-equilibrium phenomena. For instance, they provide realizations of
discrete time crystals, where the discrete time translation symmetry of the
periodic Hamiltonian is spontaneously broken by a subharmonic response of the
system. However, the continuous presence of an external periodic driving is
required within the current Floquet paradigm. We propose here the concept of
spontaneous many-body Floquet state. This is a state that, in the absence of
external periodic driving, self-oscillates like in the presence of a periodic
Hamiltonian, this behavior being spontaneously induced by many-body
interactions. In addition, its quantum fluctuations are described by regular
Floquet theory. Furthermore, it is also a time crystal, presenting long-range
time-periodic order. However, this crystalline behavior is very different to
that of conventional Floquet discrete time crystals: here, there is no external
periodic driving, energy is conserved, and the nature of the spontaneous
symmetry breaking is continuous instead of discrete. We demonstrate that
spontaneous many-body Floquet states can emerge in a variety of canonical
many-body problems, ranging from interacting fermions to Bose-Hubbard models.
We specifically show that a spontaneous many-body Floquet state is a universal
intrinsic state of a one-dimensional flowing atom condensate, both subsonic and
supersonic, resulting from a dynamical phase transition and robust against
external perturbations and quantum fluctuations, proposing also realistic
experimental scenarios for its observation. A spontaneous many-body Floquet
state not only represents a realization of a continuous time crystal, but also
a novel paradigm in Floquet physics.

matter (DM) probes, via the observational effects of annihilating captured DM.
In this respect, Population III (Pop III) stars are particularly interesting
candidates, since they form at high redshifts, in very high DM density
environments. It is customary to assume such a star would form roughly at the
center of a DM halo, and, as such, have no rotational velocity. In this paper,
we break from this assumption and explore the effects we can expect to observe
if a Pop III star forms at some distance away from the center of the halo and
thus has a non-zero rotational velocity. The capture rate of DM in such a star
is suppressed by a predictable amount. We develop and validate an analytical
expression for the capture rate suppression factor and re-evaluate the bounds
placed on the DM-nucleon cross section as a result of DM capture. We find that
our previous results, obtained under the assumption of star formed within the
central 10 AU of the DM mini-halo are essentially unchanged, even when
considering the possible rotational velocities for those central stars.

combinatorial optimization algorithm suitable for noisy quantum devices.
However, little is known about performance guarantees for $p>2$. A recent work
\cite{Wurtz_guarantee} computing MaxCut performance guarantees for 3-regular
graphs conjectures that any $d$-regular graph evaluated at particular fixed
angles has an approximation ratio greater than some worst-case guarantee. In
this work, we provide numerical evidence for this fixed angle conjecture for
$p<12$. We compute and provide these angles via numerical optimization and
tensor networks. These fixed angles serve for an optimization-free version of
QAOA, and have universally good performance on any 3 regular graph. Heuristic
evidence is presented for the fixed angle conjecture on graph ensembles, which
suggests that these fixed angles are ``close"" to global optimum. Under the
fixed angle conjecture, QAOA has a larger performance guarantee than the
Goemans Williamson algorithm on 3-regular graphs for $p\geq 11$.

worth noting that there has been an increasingly heavy pressure on the
blockchain storage caused by dealing with massive IoT data and handling
malicious access behaviors in the system, and not many countermeasures have
been seen to curb the increase. However, this problem has not been paid enough
attention. In this paper, we implement an attribute-based access control scheme
using smart contracts in Quorum blockchain. It provides basic access control
functions and conserves storage by reducing the number of smart contracts. In
addition, a reputation-based technique is introduced to cope with malicious
behaviors. Certain illegal transactions can be blocked by the credit-assessment
algorithm, which deters possibly malicious nodes and gives more chance to
well-behaved nodes. The feasibility of our proposed scheme is demonstrated by
doing experiment on a testbed and conducting a case study. Finally, the system
performance is assessed based on experimental measurement.

geometric $t$-spanner on $S_i=\{s_1,\ldots, s_i\}$ for each step~$i$.
  First, we establish a lower bound of $\Omega(\varepsilon^{-1}\log n / \log
\varepsilon^{-1})$ for the competitive ratio of any online
$(1+\varepsilon)$-spanner algorithm, for a sequence of $n$ points in
1-dimension. We show that this bound is tight, and there is an online algorithm

$O(\varepsilon^{-1}\log n / \log \varepsilon^{-1})$. Next, we design online
algorithms for sequences of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, for any constant $d\ge

achieve a competitive ratio $O(\varepsilon^{-(d+1)}\log n)$. However, if the
algorithm is allowed to use additional points (Steiner points), then it is
possible to substantially improve the competitive ratio in terms of
$\varepsilon$. We describe an online Steiner $(1+\varepsilon)$-spanner
algorithm with competitive ratio $O(\varepsilon^{(1-d)/2} \log n)$. As a

competitive ratio $\Omega(f(n))$, where $\lim_{n\rightarrow

neutrino-driven winds are not a standard feature expected after every
successful explosion. Even if our neutrino treatment is simple, we estimate the
nucleosynthesis of the exploding models for the 15 $M_\odot$ progenitor after
correcting the neutrino energies and luminosities to get a more realistic

corrupted with noise, known as motion-artifact, and IBI extracted from it is
inaccurate. As a part of remote health monitoring and wearable system
development, denoising ECG signals and estimating IBIs correctly from them have
become an emerging topic among signal-processing researchers. Apart from
conventional methods, deep-learning techniques have been successfully used in
signal denoising recently, and diagnosis process has become easier, leading to
accuracy levels that were previously unachievable. We propose a deep-learning

ALMA at $0.""1$ resolution to image a complete flux-limited sample of seven
sub-mm sources previously shown to have spectral energy distributions (SEDs)
that were as well-fitted by obscured AGN as star-forming galaxy templates.
Indeed, two sub-mm sources were known to be quasars from their absorbed X-ray
emission. We find the sub-mm sizes of all SMGs to be small ($\approx1-2$kpc)
and generally $\sim3$ times smaller than any host detected in the
Near-Infra-Red (NIR). In all cases, the five SMGs are comparable in sub-mm size
to the two known quasars and four $z\approx6$ quasars, also observed with ALMA.
We detect no evidence of diffuse spiral arms in this complete sample. We then
convert the Far-Infra-Red (FIR) luminosities to star-formation rate (SFR)
surface densities and find that the SMGs occupy the same range as the known
quasars in our sample. We conclude that in terms of sub-mm size, extent
relative to host and SFR density as well as luminosity and Mid-IR (MIR) colour,
there is little distinction between the SMGs and sub-mm bright quasars.
Finally, we present preliminary evidence that SMGs with higher MIR luminosities
and sub-mm loud quasars tend to have dust components that range to hotter
temperatures than their less luminous SMG counterparts. In light of these
results, we continue to suggest that luminous SMGs may host dust-absorbed
quasars that may simultaneously dominate the FIR and hard X-ray backgrounds.

  with beamlet intensity total variation regularization",,,"10.1002/mp.15764",,"physics.med-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Purpose: There is growing interest in the use of modern 3D printing
technology to implement intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) on the
preclinical scale which is analogous to clinical IMRT. However, current
3D-printed IMRT methods suffer from complex modulation patterns leading to long
delivery times, excess filament usage, and inaccurate compensator fabrication.
In this work, we have developed a total variation regularization (TVR) approach
to address these issues.
  Methods: TVR-IMRT, a technique designed to minimize the intensity difference
between neighboring beamlets, was used to optimize the beamlet intensity map,
which was then converted to corresponding compensator thicknesses in
copper-doped PLA filament. IMRT and TVR-IMRT plans using five beams were
generated to treat a mouse heart while sparing lung tissue. The individual
field doses and composite dose were delivered to film and compared to the
corresponding planned doses using gamma analysis.
  Results: TVR-IMRT reduced the total variation of both the beamlet intensities
and compensator thicknesses by around 50% when compared to standard 3D printed
compensator IMRT. The total mass of compensator material consumed and radiation
beam-on time were reduced by 20-30%, while DVHs remained comparable. Gamma
analysis passing rate with 3%/0.3mm criterion was 89.07% for IMRT and 95.37%
for TVR-IMRT.
  Conclusion: TVR can be applied to small animal IMRT beamlet intensities in
order to produce fluence maps and subsequent 3D-printed compensator patterns
with less total variation, simplifying 3D printing and reducing the amount of
filament required. The TVR-IMRT plan required less beam-on time while
maintaining the dose conformity when compared to a traditional IMRT plan.

the correlations across the horizon of a black hole in order to highlight the
particle-partner pair creation mechanism at the origin of Hawking radiation.
The analysis concerns both acoustic black holes, formed by Bose-Einstein
condensates, and gravitational black holes. More precisely, we have considered
a typical acoustic black hole metric with two asymptotic homogeneous regions
and the Schwarzschild metric as describing a gravitational black hole. By
considering equal time correlation functions, we find a striking disagreement
between the two cases: the expected characteristic peak centered along the
trajectories of the Hawking particles and their partners seems to appear only
for the acoustic black hole and not for the gravitational Schwarzschild one.
The reason for that is the existence of a 'quantum atmosphere' displaced from
the horizon as the locus of origin of Hawking radiation together, and this is
the crucial aspect, with the presence of a central singularity in the
gravitational case swallowing everything is trapped inside the horizon.
Correlations however are not absent in the gravitational case: to see them one
has simply to consider correlation functions at unequal times which indeed
display the expected peak.

advantage is that the total number of operations in the nested loops is
bounded, different from some $k$-medoids algorithms that involve random search.
Sparse regression is an efficient tool for feature relevance analysis, but its

is introduced in this paper to handle the unequality of class-occurrence in a

handling degradation in real-world data that usually follows a multi-modal,
spatially variant, and unknown distribution. The recent blind SR studies
address this issue via degradation estimation, but they do not generalize well
to multi-source degradation and cannot handle spatially variant degradation. We
design CRL-SR, a contrastive representation learning network that focuses on
blind SR of images with multi-modal and spatially variant distributions. CRL-SR
addresses the blind SR challenges from two perspectives. The first is
contrastive decoupling encoding which introduces contrastive learning to
extract resolution-invariant embedding and discard resolution-variant embedding
under the guidance of a bidirectional contrastive loss. The second is
contrastive feature refinement which generates lost or corrupted high-frequency
details under the guidance of a conditional contrastive loss. Extensive

synchrotron sources with a luminosity $> 10^{47}$\,erg~s$^{-1}$. The
synchrotron luminosity does not seem to vary by more than $\sim 25\%$ over 35
years. In order to appreciate this remarkable behavior, if it were at $z=0.5$,
it would have a flux density at 15 GHz in a range of $110 - 137$\,Jy over 11

10^{49}$\,erg~s$^{-1}$ were detected in 2011 and 2016. There is blazar-like
behavior coexisting with the steady behavior. This study is aimed at
elucidating the dual nature of this source. We find that the radio source is
extremely compact with a bright core and a steep spectrum secondary component,
12\,mas away, that appears to be constant in position and flux density in six
epochs from 1995 to 2018. We estimate that a jet with a time averaged power of

responds as these parameters vary, and we introduce a new diagnostic, the

log-normal at low density with two distinct power law tails at higher density;
the first of these represents the onset of self-gravitation, and the second
reflects the onset of rotational support. Once the star formation efficiency
reaches a few percent, the PDF becomes statistically steady, with no evidence
for secular time-evolution at star formation efficiencies from about five to 20
percent. We show that both the Mach number and the virial parameter influence
the characteristic densities at which the log-normal gives way to the first
power-law, and the first to the second, and we extend (for the former) and
develop (for the latter) simple theoretical models for the relationship between
these density thresholds and the global properties of the turbulent medium.

robust performance for speech phone classification. We combine modern neural
networks (normalizing flows) and traditional generative models (hidden Markov
models - HMMs). Normalizing flow-based mixture models (NMMs) are used to model
the conditional probability distribution given the hidden state in the HMMs.
Model parameters are learned through judicious combinations of time-tested
Bayesian learning methods and contemporary neural network learning methods. We
mainly combine expectation-maximization (EM) and mini-batch gradient descent.
The proposed generative models can compute likelihood of a data and hence
directly suitable for maximum-likelihood (ML) classification approach. Due to
structural flexibility of HMMs, we can use different normalizing flow models.
This leads to different types of HMMs providing diversity in data modeling
capacity. The diversity provides an opportunity for easy decision fusion from
different models. For a standard speech phone classification setup involving 39
phones (classes) and the TIMIT dataset, we show that the use of standard

estimate regional isotope uptake in lesions and at-risk organs after

complex emission spectra, the very low number of detected counts, the impact of
stray-radiation-related noise at these low counts, and the multiple
image-degrading processes in SPECT. The conventional reconstruction-based
quantification methods are observed to be erroneous for {\alpha}-RPT SPECT. To
address these challenges, we developed a low-count quantitative SPECT
(LC-QSPECT) method that directly estimates the regional activity uptake from
the projection data, compensates for stray-radiation-related noise, and for the
radioisotope and SPECT physics. The method was validated in the context of
three-dimensional SPECT with 223 Ra. Validation was performed using both
realistic simulation studies, including a virtual clinical trial, and synthetic

black holes can undergo oscillations in eccentricity and inclination angle due
to the Kozai-Lidov mechanism. In this work, we construct analytic gravitational
waveforms in the Fourier domain, taking into account the Kozai-Lidov effect at
Newtonian (leading) order. Using multiple-scale analysis, we make use of the
separability of timescales to combine the effects of both Kozai-Lidov
oscillations and radiation-reaction. We assume small eccentricity and present
analytic solutions to the evolution of the other orbital elements. Our analytic
calculation can be systematically extended to higher orders in eccentricity,
and can be used to construct inspiral-merger-ringdown models. The imprint on
the waveform, due to this combined evolution, is computed under the
stationary-phase approximation. We find that the oscillations leave a clear
signature on the Fourier amplitude of the waveform while leaving a measurable
imprint on the gravitational wave phase, and that our analytic results are
consistent with numerics. Further, with our study of the astrophysical

performed on crystals of ReO$_3$ with high mobility (90,000 cm$^2$/Vs at 2 K)
and extremely low residual resistivity (5-8 n$\Omega$cm). The Fermi surface,
comprised of intersecting cylinders, supports open orbits. The resistivity
$\rho_{xx}$ in a magnetic field $B$ = 9 T displays a singular pattern of
behavior. With $\bf E\parallel \hat{x}$ and $\bf B$ initially
$\parallel\bf\hat{z}$, tilting $\bf B$ in the longitudinal $k_z$-$k_x$ plane
leads to a steep decrease in $\rho_{xx}$ by a factor of 40. However, if $\bf B$
is tilted in the transverse $k_y$-$k_z$ plane, $\rho_{xx}$ increases steeply by
a factor of 8. Using the Shockley tube integral approach, we show that, in
ReO$_3$, the singular behavior results from the rapid conversion of closed to
open orbits, resulting in opposite signs for AMR in orthogonal planes. The
floor values of $\rho_{xx}$ in both AMR scans are identified with specific sets
of open and closed orbits. Also, the ""completion angle"" $\gamma_c$ detected in
the AMR is shown to be an intrinsic geometric feature that provides a new way
to measure the Fermi radius $k_F$. However, additional sharp resonant features
which appear at very small tilt angles in the longitudinal AMR scans are not
explained by the tube integral approach.

These two matrices can be described as the latent factors, represented in the

geometric path, we interpret our $q$-paths as corresponding to a
$q$-exponential family of distributions, and provide a variational

techniques investigation for senior level electrical engineering (EE) courses
at Qatar University. The course project of the senior course was designed in
such a way that it helps in simultaneously attaining the objectives of the
senior and capstone courses, that the students were taking at the same time. It
is known that the MPL approach enhances the critical thinking capacity of
students which is also a major outcome of Education for Sustainable Development
(ESD). The developed project ensures the fulfillment of a series of SLOs, that
are concentrated on soft engineering and project management skills. The
difficulties of adopting the MPL method for the senior level courses are in
aligning the project towards fulfilling the learning outcomes of every
individual course. The study also provides the students feedback on online
assessment techniques incorporated with the MPL, due to online teaching during
COVID-19 pandemic. In order to provide a benchmark and to highlight the
obtained results, the innovative teaching approaches were compared to
conventional methods taught on the same senior course in a previous semester.
Based on the feedback from teachers and students from previously conducted case
study it was believed that the MPL approach would support the students. With
the statistical analysis (Chi-square, two-tailed T statistics and hypothesis
testing using z-test) it can be concluded that the MPL and online assessment
actually help to achieve better attainment of the SLOs, even during a pandemic

which species to prioritize, given constrained resources. One way of
prioritizing species is to consider their ""evolutionary distinctiveness"", i.e.
their relative evolutionary isolation on a phylogenetic tree. Several
evolutionary isolation metrics or phylogenetic diversity indices have been
introduced in the literature, among them the so-called Fair Proportion index
(also known as the ""evolutionary distinctiveness"" score). This index apportions
the total diversity of a tree among all leaves, thereby providing a simple
prioritization criterion for conservation.
  Here, we focus on the prioritization order obtained from the Fair Proportion
index and analyze the effects of species extinction on this ranking. More
precisely, we analyze the extent to which the ranking order may change when
some species go extinct and the Fair Proportion index is re-computed for the
remaining taxa. We show that for each phylogenetic tree, there are edge lengths
such that the extinction of one leaf per cherry completely reverses the
ranking. Moreover, we show that even if only the lowest ranked species goes
extinct, the ranking order may drastically change. We end by analyzing the
effects of these two extinction scenarios (extinction of the lowest ranked
species and extinction of one leaf per cherry) for a collection of empirical
and simulated trees. In both cases, we can observe significant changes in the
prioritization orders, highlighting the empirical relevance of our theoretical
findings.

dimensional analysis, including a novel collision-induced breakage mechanism,
and split into one- and two-particles processes. While the first are linear
processes, they might both depend on local flow properties (e.g. shear). This
means that the upscaling (via volume averaging and homogenisation) to a
macroscopic (Darcy-scale) description requires closures assumptions.
  We discuss this problem and derive an effective macroscopic term for the
shear-induced events, such as breakage caused by shear forces on the
transported particles. We focus on breakage events as prototype for linear
shear-induced events and derive upscaled breakage frequencies in periodic
geometries, starting from non-linear power-law dependence on the local fluid
shear rate. Results are presented for a two-dimensional channel flow and a
three dimensional regular arrangement of spheres, for arbitrarily fast

A* and a gamma-ray point source has been detected coinciding with the SMBH's
position, although there is no definitive association between the two. In this
work, we have used ~11 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations
of the point source 4FGL J1745.6-2859 and performed a detailed imaging analysis
across four energy bands. Our goal is to elucidate the nature of the gamma-ray
emission at the Galactic Center (GC) and whether it is associated with the
SMBH. We find that the centroid of the emission approaches Sgr A*'s location as
the energy increases. Assuming that the gamma-ray point source is located at
the GC, we estimate a luminosity of 2.61E36 erg/s in the 100 MeV to 500 GeV
energy range. This is consistent with Sgr A*'s bolometric luminosity. Based on
the point source properties, we ruled out several potential candidates for its
nature and favor a cosmic ray origin either from protons, electrons or both,
accelerated by -- or in the vicinity of -- the SMBH. Our results indicate that
the point source at the GC is indeed the gamma-ray counterpart of Sgr A* in the

  Security, VOL.21 No.6, June 2021",,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In the systems and software modeling field, a conceptual model involves
modeling with concepts to support development and design. An example of a
conceptual model is a description developed using the Unified Modeling Language
(UML). UML uses a model multiplicity formulation approach, wherein a number of
models are used to represent alternative views. By contrast, a model
singularity approach uses only a single integrated model. Each of these styles
of modeling has its strengths and weaknesses. This paper introduces a partial
solution to the issue of multiplicity vs. singularity in modeling by adopting
UML use cases and class models into the conceptual thinging machine (TM) model.
To apply use cases, we adopt the observation that a use-case diagram is a
description that shows the internal structure of the part of the system
represented by the use case in addition to being useful to people outside of
the system. Additionally, the UML class diagram is recast in TM representation.
Accordingly, we develop a TMUML model that embraces the TM specification of the
UML class diagram and the internal structure extracted from the UML use case.
TMUML modeling introduces some of the advantages that have made UML a popular
modeling language to TM modeling. At the same time, this approach supplies UML
with partial model singularity. The paper details experimentation with TMUML
using examples from the literature. Our results indicate that mixing UML with
other models could be a viable approach.

at low missing momentum. It is considerably smaller (up to $\approx 0.01$) for

Here, we report the hydrothermal crystal growth of a new copper tellurite

layered perovskites. The orthorhombic phase (space group $Pnma$) is made of

edge-shared with TeO$_4$ units. The layers are linked by slabs of
corner-sharing CuO$_4$ and SO$_4$. Using both the bond valence sum analysis and

mixed valence of Cu$^{2+}$/Cu${^+}$ between the layers.
Cu$_3$(TeO$_4$)(SO$_4$)$\cdot$H$_2$O undergoes an antiferromagnetic transition
at $T_N$=67 K marked by a peak in the magnetic susceptibility. Upon further
cooling, a spin-canting transition occurs at $T^{\star}$=12 K evidenced by a

the goal location by walking. A state machine together with a decision making
strategy allows the system to switch behaviors between walking around obstacles
or jumping through them. The proposed framework is experimentally deployed and
validated on a quadrupedal robot, a Mini Cheetah, to enable the robot to
autonomously navigate through an environment while avoiding obstacles and
jumping over a maximum height of 13 cm to pass through a window-shaped opening
in order to reach its goal.

first suggested by Dasgupta et al.~\cite{dasgupta2020explainable}.
Specifically, we focus on the $k$-means and $k$-medians problems and provide
nearly tight upper and lower bounds.
  First, we provide an $O(\log k \log \log k)$-approximation algorithm for
explainable $k$-medians, improving on the best known algorithm of
$O(k)$~\cite{dasgupta2020explainable} and nearly matching the known
$\Omega(\log k)$ lower bound~\cite{dasgupta2020explainable}. In addition, in
low-dimensional spaces $d \ll \log k$, we show that our algorithm also provides
an $O(d \log^2 d)$-approximate solution for explainable $k$-medians. This
improves over the best known bound of $O(d \log k)$ for low
dimensions~\cite{laber2021explainable}, and is a constant for constant
dimensional spaces. To complement this, we show a nearly matching $\Omega(d)$
lower bound. Next, we study the $k$-means problem in this context and provide
an $O(k \log k)$-approximation algorithm for explainable $k$-means, improving
over the $O(k^2)$ bound of Dasgupta et al. and the $O(d k \log k)$ bound of
\cite{laber2021explainable}. To complement this we provide an almost tight
$\Omega(k)$ lower bound, improving over the $\Omega(\log k)$ lower bound of
Dasgupta et al. Given an approximate solution to the classic $k$-means and
$k$-medians, our algorithm for $k$-medians runs in time $O(kd \log^2 k )$ and
our algorithm for $k$-means runs in time $ O(k^2 d)$.

clients' data distributions diverge from each other. This divergence further
leads to a dilemma: ""Should we prioritize the learned model's generic
performance (for future use at the server) or its personalized performance (for
each client)?"" These two, seemingly competing goals have divided the community
to focus on one or the other, yet in this paper we show that it is possible to

prediction tasks. On the one hand, we introduce a family of losses that are
robust to non-identical class distributions, enabling clients to train a
generic predictor with a consistent objective across them. On the other hand,
we formulate the personalized predictor as a lightweight adaptive module that
is learned to minimize each client's empirical risk on top of the generic
predictor. With this two-loss, two-predictor framework which we name Federated
Robust Decoupling (Fed-RoD), the learned model can simultaneously achieve
state-of-the-art generic and personalized performance, essentially bridging the

  effects of radical cure",,,,,"q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease with a devastating global impact.
Plasmodium vivax is a major cause of human malaria beyond sub-Saharan Africa.
Relapsing infections, driven by a reservoir of liver-stage parasites known as
hypnozoites, present unique challenges for the control of P. vivax malaria.
Following indeterminate dormancy periods, hypnozoites may activate to trigger
relapses. Clearance of the hypnozoite reservoir through drug treatment (radical
cure) has been proposed as a potential tool for the elimination of P. vivax
malaria. Here, we introduce a stochastic, within-host model to jointly
characterise hypnozoite and infection dynamics for an individual in a general
transmission setting, allowing for radical cure. We begin by extending an
existing activation-clearance model for a single hypnozoite, adapted to both
short- and long-latency strains, to include drug treatment. We then embed this
activation-clearance model in an epidemiological framework accounting for
repeated mosquito inoculation and the administration of radical cure. By
constructing an open network of infinite server queues, we derive analytic
expressions for several quantities of epidemiological significance, including
the size of the hypnozoite reservoir; the relative contribution of relapses to
the infection burden; the distribution of multiple infections; the cumulative
number of recurrences over time, and the time to first recurrence following
drug treatment. By deriving, rather than assuming parameteric forms, we
characterise the transient dynamics of the hypnozoite reservoir following
radical cure more accurately than previous approaches. To yield
population-level insights, our analytic within-host distributions can be
embedded in multiscale models. Our work thus contributes to the epidemiological
understanding of the effects of radical cure on P. vivax malaria.

hybrid Transformer architecture that integrates self-attention into a

long-range dependency at different scales with minimal overhead. To this end,
we propose an efficient self-attention mechanism along with relative position
encoding that reduces the complexity of self-attention operation significantly
from $O(n^2)$ to approximate $O(n)$. A new self-attention decoder is also
proposed to recover fine-grained details from the skipped connections in the

amounts of data to learn vision inductive bias. Our hybrid layer design allows
the initialization of Transformer into convolutional networks without a need of

computer vision tasks, such as estimating keypoint heatmaps and segmentation
masks. These regression problems are very challenging particularly because they
require, at low computation overheads, modeling long-range dependencies on
high-resolution inputs/outputs to estimate the highly nonlinear pixel-wise
semantics. While attention mechanisms in Deep Convolutional Neural
Networks(DCNNs) has become popular for boosting long-range dependencies,
element-specific attention, such as Nonlocal blocks, is highly complex and
noise-sensitive to learn, and most of simplified attention hybrids try to reach
the best compromise among multiple types of tasks. In this paper, we present
the Polarized Self-Attention(PSA) block that incorporates two critical designs
towards high-quality pixel-wise regression: (1) Polarized filtering: keeping
high internal resolution in both channel and spatial attention computation
while completely collapsing input tensors along their counterpart dimensions.
(2) Enhancement: composing non-linearity that directly fits the output
distribution of typical fine-grained regression, such as the 2D Gaussian
distribution (keypoint heatmaps), or the 2D Binormial distribution (binary
segmentation masks). PSA appears to have exhausted the representation capacity
within its channel-only and spatial-only branches, such that there is only
marginal metric differences between its sequential and parallel layouts.
Experimental results show that PSA boosts standard baselines by $2-4$ points,
and boosts state-of-the-arts by $1-2$ points on 2D pose estimation and semantic
segmentation benchmarks.

made cyber systems more vulnerable. As attackers become increasingly
sophisticated and resourceful, mere reliance on traditional cyber protection,

secure the cyber systems. Cyber resilience provides a new security paradigm
that complements inadequate protection with resilience mechanisms. A
Cyber-Resilient Mechanism (CRM) adapts to the known or zero-day threats and
uncertainties in real-time and strategically responds to them to maintain
critical functions of the cyber systems in the event of successful attacks.
Feedback architectures play a pivotal role in enabling the online sensing,
reasoning, and actuation process of the CRM. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is an
essential tool that epitomizes the feedback architectures for cyber resilience.
It allows the CRM to provide sequential responses to attacks with limited or
without prior knowledge of the environment and the attacker. In this work, we
review the literature on RL for cyber resilience and discuss cyber resilience
against three major types of vulnerabilities, i.e., posture-related,
information-related, and human-related vulnerabilities. We introduce three
application domains of CRMs: moving target defense, defensive cyber deception,
and assistive human security technologies. The RL algorithms also have
vulnerabilities themselves. We explain the three vulnerabilities of RL and
present attack models where the attacker targets the information exchanged
between the environment and the agent: the rewards, the state observations, and
the action commands. We show that the attacker can trick the RL agent into
learning a nefarious policy with minimum attacking effort. Lastly, we discuss
the future challenges of RL for cyber security and resilience and emerging
applications of RL-based CRMs.

Through probing chemical changes of LIPS, we unveil
light-induced-iodide-repulsion and the formation of Br-rich-phase in
illuminated regions during LIPS. This discovery also gives insight into LIPS
process in three dimensional (3D) MHPs. By further investigating LIPS in 3D
MHPs, we reveal that LIPS induces not only the formation of Br-rich and I-rich
domains but also an overall change of halide distribution along the film
thickness direction, which can affect the electronic energy alignment and
consequently MHPs devices performance. Moreover, LIPS is more significant in
the bulk due to larger population of photogenerated charge carriers. Overall,
this study reveals the chemical mechanism of LIPS in MHPs and its potential

introduce a special type of SCM called a neural causal model (NCM), and
formalize a new type of inductive bias to encode structural constraints
necessary for performing causal inferences. Building on this new class of
models, we focus on solving two canonical tasks found in the literature known
as causal identification and estimation. Leveraging the neural toolbox, we
develop an algorithm that is both sufficient and necessary to determine whether
a causal effect can be learned from data (i.e., causal identifiability); it
then estimates the effect whenever identifiability holds (causal estimation).
Simulations corroborate the proposed approach.

demonstrate that crystal defects, such as dislocations, are instrumental in
initiating the process of phase separation in strained metastable layers.
Matrix regions, close to the dislocations, show clear signs of compositional
degradation only after a relatively short time from disrupting the local
equilibrium. The solute concentration as well as the density of non-random
atomic clusters increases while approaching a dislocation from the surrounding
matrix region. In parallel, far from a dislocation the lattice remains intact
preserving the metastable structure and composition uniformity. At advanced
stages of phase separation, the matrix outside the dislocation reaches the
equilibrium concentration, while dislocations act as vehicles of
mass-transport, providing fast diffusive channels for solute atoms to reach the
surface. Besides, the number of atomic clusters almost doubles and the number
of atoms per cluster increases steadily, moving along a dislocation towards the

quantity in machine learning. In particular, a relative density-ratio, which is
a bounded extension of the density-ratio, has received much attention due to
its stability and has been used in various applications such as outlier
detection and dataset comparison. Existing methods for (relative) density-ratio
estimation (DRE) require many instances from both densities. However,
sufficient instances are often unavailable in practice. In this paper, we
propose a meta-learning method for relative DRE, which estimates the relative
density-ratio from a few instances by using knowledge in related datasets.
Specifically, given two datasets that consist of a few instances, our model
extracts the datasets' information by using neural networks and uses it to
obtain instance embeddings appropriate for the relative DRE. We model the
relative density-ratio by a linear model on the embedded space, whose global
optimum solution can be obtained as a closed-form solution. The closed-form
solution enables fast and effective adaptation to a few instances, and its
differentiability enables us to train our model such that the expected test
error for relative DRE can be explicitly minimized after adapting to a few
instances. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method

technique based on the alternating directions multiplier method (ADMM). The
proposed ADMM sequence estimation (ADMMSE) FTN signaling detector demonstrates
an excellent trade-off between performance and computational effort enabling
successful detection and SE gains for QAM modulation orders as high as 64K
(65,536). The complexity of the proposed ADMMSE detector is polynomial in the
length of the transmit symbols sequence and its sensitivity to the modulation
order increases only logarithmically. Simulation results show that for 16-QAM,
the proposed ADMMSE FTN signaling detector achieves comparable SE gains to the
generalized approach semidefinite relaxation-based sequence estimation

computational time. Simulation results additionally show SE gains for
modulation orders starting from 4-QAM, or quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK),

the optimal spatial organization of a sensing system for a given spatial

find that spatial receptor localization maximizes information acquisition in
many natural contexts, including tissue and soil. Receptor localization extends
naturally to produce a dynamic protocol for redistributing signaling receptors
during cell navigation and can be implemented in a cell using a feedback

non-experimental data into an approximate randomized controlled trial using
statistical matching. Despite empirical researchers' best intention and effort
to create high-quality matched samples, residual imbalance due to observed
covariates not being well matched often persists. Although statistical tests
have been developed to test the randomization assumption and its implications,
few provide a means to quantify the level of residual confounding due to
observed covariates not being well matched in matched samples. In this article,
we develop two generic classes of exact statistical tests for a biased
randomization assumption. One important by-product of our testing framework is
a quantity called residual sensitivity value (RSV), which provides a means to
quantify the level of residual confounding due to imperfect matching of
observed covariates in a matched sample. We advocate taking into account RSV in
the downstream primary analysis. The proposed methodology is illustrated by
re-examining a famous observational study concerning the effect of right heart

Existing methods usually require many instances for feature selection. However,
sufficient instances are often unavailable in practice. The proposed method can
select a subset of relevant features in a target task given a few unlabeled
target instances by training with unlabeled instances in multiple source tasks.
Our model consists of a feature selector and decoder. The feature selector
outputs a subset of relevant features taking a few unlabeled instances as input
such that the decoder can reconstruct the original features of unseen instances
from the selected ones. The feature selector uses the Concrete random variables
to select features via gradient descent. To encode task-specific properties
from a few unlabeled instances to the model, the Concrete random variables and
decoder are modeled using permutation-invariant neural networks that take a few
unlabeled instances as input. Our model is trained by minimizing the expected
test reconstruction error given a few unlabeled instances that is calculated
with datasets in source tasks. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing feature selection methods.

practice, but theoretical justification for their empirical success remains
elusive. In fact, it has long been known that there are simple target functions

  Recent work of Brutzkus, Daniely, and Malach (COLT 2020) considered the
smoothed analysis model as a possible avenue towards resolving this disconnect.
Within the smoothed setting and for targets $f$ that are $k$-juntas, they
showed that these heuristics successfully learn $f$ with depth-$k$ decision
tree hypotheses. They conjectured that the same guarantee holds more generally
for targets that are depth-$k$ decision trees.
  We provide a counterexample to this conjecture: we construct targets that are
depth-$k$ decision trees and show that even in the smoothed setting, these
heuristics build trees of depth $2^{\Omega(k)}$ before achieving high accuracy.
We also show that the guarantees of Brutzkus et al. cannot extend to the
agnostic setting: there are targets that are very close to $k$-juntas, for

non-thermal luminosities and SFR could shed light onto their nature. We develop
a model to compute the CR populations of SFGs, taking into account their
production, transport, and cooling. The model is parameterised only through
global galaxy properties, and describes the non-thermal emission in both radio
and gamma-rays. We focus on the role of diffusive and advective transport by
galactic winds, either driven by turbulent or thermal instabilities. We compare
model predictions to observations, for which we compile a homogeneous set of
luminosities in these radio bands, and update those available in gamma-rays.
Our model reproduces reasonably well the observed relations between the
gamma-ray or 1.4 GHz radio luminosities and the SFR, assuming a single
power-law scaling of the magnetic field with the latter with index beta=0.3,
and winds blowing either at Alfvenic speeds or typical starburst wind
velocities. Escape of CR is negligible for > 30 Mo/yr. A constant ionisation
fraction of the interstellar medium fails to reproduce the 150 MHz radio
luminosity throughout the whole SFR range. Our results reinforce the idea that
galaxies with high SFR are CR calorimeters, and that the main mechanism driving
proton escape is diffusion, whereas electron escape also proceeds via wind
advection. They also suggest that these winds should be CR or thermally-driven
at low and intermediate SFR, respectively. Our results globally support that
magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is responsible for the dependence of the
magnetic field strength on the SFR and that the ionisation fraction is strongly
disfavoured to be constant throughout the whole SFR range.

to be reconstructed with higher accuracy compared to non-ROI coefficients. In

estimates the geospatial location of a street view image by matching it with a
database of geo-tagged aerial images. The cross-view matching task is extremely
challenging due to drastic appearance and geometry differences across views.
Unlike existing methods that predominantly fall back on CNN, here we devise a
novel evolving geo-localization Transformer (EgoTR) that utilizes the
properties of self-attention in Transformer to model global dependencies, thus
significantly decreasing visual ambiguities in cross-view geo-localization. We
also exploit the positional encoding of Transformer to help the EgoTR
understand and correspond geometric configurations between ground and aerial
images. Compared to state-of-the-art methods that impose strong assumption on
geometry knowledge, the EgoTR flexibly learns the positional embeddings through
the training objective and hence becomes more practical in many real-world
scenarios. Although Transformer is well suited to our task, its vanilla
self-attention mechanism independently interacts within image patches in each
layer, which overlooks correlations between layers. Instead, this paper propose
a simple yet effective self-cross attention mechanism to improve the quality of
learned representations. The self-cross attention models global dependencies
between adjacent layers, which relates between image patches while modeling how
features evolve in the previous layer. As a result, the proposed self-cross
attention leads to more stable training, improves the generalization ability
and encourages representations to keep evolving as the network goes deeper.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our EgoTR performs favorably against
state-of-the-art methods on standard, fine-grained and cross-dataset cross-view
geo-localization tasks.

different geopotential heights can capture different climate phenomena and
modes. Without deseasonalization, the first eigen microstates capture the
seasonal effect and reveal that the phase of the intra-annual cycle moves with
the geopotential heights. After deseasonalization, by contrast, the collective
patterns from the overall trend, ENSO, QBO, and tropopause pressure are
identified by the first few significant eigen microstates. The theoretical
framework proposed here can also be applied to other complex Earth systems.

satisfying the QoS requirement of their mobile users. Therefore, in this paper,
we propose joint user association and wireless resource sharing problem in the
cell-free UAVs-assisted wireless networks with the objective of maximizing the
total network utility of the SPs while ensuring QoS constraints of their mobile
users and the resource constraints of the UAVs deployed by MNOs. To solve the
proposed mixed-integer non-convex problem, we decompose the proposed problem
into two subproblems: users association, and resource sharing problems. Then, a
two-sided matching algorithm is deployed in order to solve users association
problem. We further deploy the whale optimization and Lagrangian relaxation
algorithms to solve the resource sharing problem. Finally, extensive numerical
results are provided in order to show the effectiveness of our proposed

developed to predict users' preference for next-item recommendation. Although a
session can usually reflect a user's current preference, a local shift of the
user's intention within the session may still exist. Specifically, the
interactions that take place in the early positions within a session generally
indicate the user's initial intention, while later interactions are more likely
to represent the latest intention. Such positional information has been rarely
considered in existing methods, which restricts their ability to capture the
significance of interactions at different positions. To thoroughly exploit the
positional information within a session, a theoretical framework is developed
in this paper to provide an in-depth analysis of the positional information. We
formally define the properties of forward-awareness and backward-awareness to
evaluate the ability of positional encoding schemes in capturing the initial
and the latest intention. According to our analysis, existing positional
encoding schemes are generally forward-aware only, which can hardly represent
the dynamics of the intention in a session. To enhance the positional encoding
scheme for the session-based recommendation, a dual positional encoding (DPE)
is proposed to account for both forward-awareness and backward-awareness. Based
on DPE, we propose a novel Positional Recommender (PosRec) model with a
well-designed Position-aware Gated Graph Neural Network module to fully exploit
the positional information for session-based recommendation tasks. Extensive
experiments are conducted on two e-commerce benchmark datasets, Yoochoose and
Diginetica and the experimental results show the superiority of the PosRec by
comparing it with the state-of-the-art session-based recommender models.

in dimensions $\rm d>1$. These higher-order topological insulators possess $\rm
(d - 1)$-dimensional boundaries that, unlike those of conventional topological
insulators, do not conduct via gapless states but instead are themselves
topological insulators. Precisely, an $\rm n^{\rm th}$-order topological
insulator in $\rm m$ dimensions hosts $\rm d_{c} = (m - n)$-dimensional
boundary modes $\rm (n \leq m)$. For instance, a three-dimensional second
(third) order topological insulator hosts gapless modes on the hinges
(corners), characterized by $\rm d_{c} = 1 (0)$. Similarly, a second order
topological insulator in two dimensions only has gapless corner states ($\rm
d_{c} = 0$) localized at the boundary. These higher order phases are protected
by various crystalline symmetries. Moreover, in presence of proximity induced
superconductivity and appropriate symmetry breaking perturbations, the above
mentioned bulk-boundary correspondence can be extended to higher order
topological superconductors hosting Majorana hinge or corner modes. Such
higher-order systems constitute a distinctive new family of topological phases
of matter which has been experimentally observed in acoustic systems,
multilayer $\rm WTe_{2}$ and $\rm Bi_{4}Br_{4}$ chains. In this general

machine learning. Most work in causality starts from the premise that the
causal variables themselves are observed. However, for AI agents such as robots
trying to make sense of their environment, the only observables are low-level
variables like pixels in images. To generalize well, an agent must induce
high-level variables, particularly those which are causal or are affected by
causal variables. A central goal for AI and causality is thus the joint
discovery of abstract representations and causal structure. However, we note
that existing environments for studying causal induction are poorly suited for
this objective because they have complicated task-specific causal graphs which
are impossible to manipulate parametrically (e.g., number of nodes, sparsity,
causal chain length, etc.). In this work, our goal is to facilitate research in
learning representations of high-level variables as well as causal structures
among them. In order to systematically probe the ability of methods to identify
these variables and structures, we design a suite of benchmarking RL
environments. We evaluate various representation learning algorithms from the

several unique electromagnetic phenomena producing radiation over X-ray to

maser emission (ECME) observed as periodic, circularly polarized radio pulses.
The phenomenon was first discovered in the hot magnetic star CU Vir. Past
observations of this star led to the consensus that the star produces only
right circularly polarized ECME, suggesting that only one magnetic hemisphere
takes part in the phenomenon. Here we present the first ultra-wideband (0.4$-$4
GHz) study of this star using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio telescope and
the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array, which led to the surprising discovery of
ECME of both circular polarizations up to around 1.5 GHz. The GHz observations
also allowed us to infer that the upper ECME cut-off frequency is at $\gtrsim
5\,\mathrm{GHz}$. The sub-GHz observation led to the unexpected observation of
more than two pairs of ECME pulses per rotation cycle. In addition, we report
the discovery of a `giant pulse', and transient enhancements, which are
potentially the first observational evidence of `centrifugal breakout' of
plasma from the innermost part of the stellar magnetosphere. The stark contrast
between the star's behavior at GHz and sub-GHz frequencies could either be due
to propagation effects, a manifestation of varying magnetic field topology as a
function of height, or a signature of an additional `ECME engine'.

reflectors by classifying signals when such 5G signals are reflected and
received from various objects. We generate birth points using the measurements
from 5G mmWave signals received by the vehicle and classify objects by
clustering birth points generated over time. Each time we use the DP clustering
method, we can map landmarks in the environment in challenging situations where
false alarms exist in the measurements and change the cardinality of received
signals. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme.
By comparing the results with the SLAM based on the Rao-Blackwellized

North-South (NS) asymmetry in sunspot activity varying on a time scale of
several solar cycles. This paper proposes a dynamo model for the phenomenon of
long-term NS asymmetry. The model separates dynamo equations for magnetic
fields of dipolar and quadrupolar equatorial parity. The NS asymmetry results
from the superposition of dipolar and quadrupolar fields. Model computations
confirm the formerly proposed excitation of the quadrupolar dynamo mode by a
dominant dipolar mode mediated by the equator-symmetric fluctuations in the
$\alpha$-effect as a mechanism for the long-term NS asymmetry. An analytically
solvable example of oscillations excited by short-term random forcing is given
to justify the numerical result of NS asymmetry coherent on a time scale of
several (about 6 in the present model) solar cycles resulting from random
variations in the $\alpha$-effect on a time scale of one solar rotation. The
model computations show the phase locking phenomenon of dipolar and quadrupolar
fields oscillating predominantly in phase (northern type asymmetry) or in
antiphase (southern type asymmetry) with relatively short irregular transitions
between these two states. Large asymmetry in the simulated Grand minima is
found and explained by weak magnetic quenching of the $\alpha$-effect during
the minima. The possibility of polar field asymmetry in activity minima as a
precursor of sunspot asymmetry in the following activity cycles is discussed
based on the dynamo model and observations.

technique for formulating combinatorial optimization problems. Inside a solver,
primal heuristics play a critical role in finding good feasible solutions that
enable one to tighten the duality gap from the outset of the Branch-and-Bound

aggressively. In this paper, we investigate whether effective primal heuristics
can be automatically learned via machine learning. We propose a new method to
represent an optimization problem as a graph, and train a Graph Convolutional
Network on solved problem instances with known optimal solutions. This in turn
can predict the values of decision variables in the optimal solution for an
unseen problem instance of a similar type. The prediction of variable solutions
is then leveraged by a novel configuration of the B&B method, Probabilistic
Branching with guided Depth-first Search (PB-DFS) approach, aiming to find

The deformation splitting of the isovector (IV) giant dipole resonance is well

well understood. [Purpose] I explore the IV monopole and quadrupole excitations
and attempt to obtain the generic features of IV giant resonances in deformed
nuclei by investigating the neutral and charge-exchange channels
simultaneously. [Method] I employ a nuclear energy-density functional (EDF)
method: the Skyrme-Kohn-Sham-Bogoliubov and the quasiparticle random-phase
approximation are used to describe the ground state and the transition to
excited states. [Results] I find the concentration of the monopole strengths in
the energy region of the isobaric analog or Gamow-Teller resonance irrespective
of nuclear deformation, and the appearance of a high-energy giant resonance
composed of the particle-hole configurations of $2\hbar \omega_0$ excitation.
Splitting of the distribution of the strength occurs in the giant monopole and
quadrupole resonances due to deformation. The lower $K$ states of quadrupole
resonances appear lower in energy and possess the enhanced strengths in the
prolate configuration, and vice versa in the oblate configuration, while the
energy ordering depending on $K$ is not clear for the $J=1$ and $J=2$

generously in the giant monopole and quadrupole resonances. The $K$-dependence

well that can confine the relevant species to a localized region. Here, we
report that magnetic microparticles with tailored anisotropy can transition
from localized off-axis gyration to large-area locomotion in a rotating
magnetic trap. The microparticles, consisting of assemblies of magnetic cores,
are observed to either rotate about its structural geometric center or gyrate
about one of the magnetic cores, the switching of which can be modulated by the
external field. Raising the magnetic field strength above a threshold, the
particles can go beyond the traditional synchronous-rotation and
asynchronous-oscillation modes, and into a scenario of large-area circular

including turbulence and gravity. We propose a triangulation-based method to
dissect the density structure of a molecular cloud and study the interactions
between dense cores and their environments. In our {approach}, a Delaunay
triangulation is constructed, which consists of edges connecting these cores.
Starting from this construction, we study the physical connections between
neighboring dense cores and the ambient environment in a systematic fashion. We
apply our method to the Cygnus-X massive GMC complex and find that the core
separation is related to the mean surface density by $\Sigma_{\rm edge} \propto
l_{\rm core }^{-0.28 }$, which can be explained by {fragmentation controlled by
a scale-dependent turbulent pressure (where the pressure is a function of
scale, e.g. $p\sim l^{2/3}$)}. We also find that the masses of low-mass cores
($M_{\rm core} < 10\, M_{\odot}$) are determined by fragmentation, whereas
massive cores ($M_{\rm core} > 10\, M_{\odot}$) grow mostly through accretion.
The transition from fragmentation to accretion coincides with the transition
from a log-normal core mass function (CMF) to a power-law CMF. By constructing
surface density profiles measured along edges that connect neighboring cores,
we find evidence that the massive cores have accreted a significant fraction of
gas from their surroundings and thus depleted the gas reservoir. Our analysis
reveals a picture where cores form through fragmentation controlled by
scale-dependent turbulent pressure support, followed by accretion onto the
massive cores, {and the method can be applied to different regions to achieve
deeper understandings in the future.

graphical models for systems comprising a large number of variables. Like
Bayesian networks, the structure of a dependency network is represented by a
directed graph, and each node has a conditional probability table. Learning and
inference are realized locally on individual nodes; therefore, computation
remains tractable even with a large number of variables. However, the
dependency network's learned distribution is the stationary distribution of a
Markov chain called pseudo-Gibbs sampling and has no closed-form expressions.
This technical disadvantage has impeded the development of dependency networks.
In this paper, we consider a certain manifold for each node. Then, we can
interpret pseudo-Gibbs sampling as iterative m-projections onto these
manifolds. This interpretation provides a theoretical bound for the location
where the stationary distribution of pseudo-Gibbs sampling exists in
distribution space. Furthermore, this interpretation involves structure and
parameter learning algorithms as optimization problems. In addition, we compare
dependency and Bayesian networks experimentally. The results demonstrate that
the dependency network and the Bayesian network have roughly the same
performance in terms of the accuracy of their learned distributions. The
results also show that the dependency network can learn much faster than the

of homomorphisms from $H$ to $G$ and the number of subgraphs isomorphic to $H$

graph limits theory when the host graphs are allowed to be dense. This paper
addresses the case when the host graphs are robustly sparse and proves a
general theorem that solves a number of open questions proposed since 1990s and
strengthens a number of results in the literature.
  We prove that for any graph $H$ and any set ${\mathcal H}$ of homomorphisms
from $H$ to members of a hereditary class ${\mathcal G}$ of graphs, if
${\mathcal H}$ satisfies a natural and mild condition, and contracting disjoint
subgraphs of radius $O(\lvert V(H) \rvert)$ in members of ${\mathcal G}$ cannot
create a graph with large edge-density, then an obvious lower bound for the
size of ${\mathcal H}$ gives a good estimation for the size of ${\mathcal H}$.
This result determines the maximum number of $H$-homomorphisms, the maximum
number of $H$-subgraphs, and the maximum number $H$-induced subgraphs in graphs
in any hereditary class with bounded expansion up to a constant factor; it also
determines the exact value of the asymptotic logarithmic density for
$H$-homomorphisms, $H$-subgraphs and $H$-induced subgraphs in graphs in any
hereditary nowhere dense class. Hereditary classes with bounded expansion
include (topological) minor-closed families and many classes of graphs with
certain geometric properties; nowhere dense classes are the most general sparse
classes in sparsity theory. Our machinery also allows us to determine the
maximum number of $H$-subgraphs in the class of all $d$-degenerate graphs with

enormous effort in NIDS, the security of network data has always been a prime
concern. However, to encounter the security problem and enable sharing among
organizations, Federated Learning (FL) scheme is employed. Although the current
FL systems have been successful, a network's data distribution does not always
fit into a single global model as in FL. Thus, in such cases, having a single
global model in FL is no feasible. In this paper, we propose a
Segmented-Federated Learning (Segmented-FL) learning scheme for a more
efficient NIDS. The Segmented-FL approach employs periodic local model
evaluation based on which the segmentation occurs. We aim to bring similar
network environments to the same group. Further, the Segmented-FL system is
coupled with a weighted aggregation of local model parameters based on the
number of data samples a worker possesses to further augment the performance.
The improved performance by our system as compared to the FL and centralized
systems on standard dataset further validates our system and makes a strong
case for extending our technique across various tasks. The solution finds its
application in organizations that want to collaboratively learn on diverse
network environments and protect the privacy of individual datasets.

uncover four distinctive groups of travellers based on the observed choice

avid cyclists and do not see on-demand mobility as an alternative for making
urban trips. Two classes, Tech-ready individuals (27%) and Flex-ready

time-sensitive and would thus use on-demand service if they were sufficiently
fast. The latter is highly costsensitive, and would therefore use the service
primarily if it is cheap. The fourth class, Flex-sceptic individuals (9%) shows
very limited potential for using on-demand services.

performed in one direction it is accompanied by a transfer of correlations into
the post-teleportation state of qubit $C$, which results in decoherence of the
state. In the other direction, if no new decoherence process occurs, we find
that not only the state of the qubit but also its correlations with an

depend on the measurement outcome during telportation and do not differentiate
between classical and quantum correlations. If, on the other hand, the second
teleportation step is preceded by decoherence of the Bell state then the
situation is much more complicated. Teleportation and transfer of correlations
occur simultaneously, yielding different teleported qubit-environment states
for different measurement outcomes. These states can differ in the degree of
coherence of the teleported qubit, but only for an entangling

offloading in a multi-access edge computing system. Specifically, a two-phase
algorithm, is proposed, including two key phases: 1) user association phase and
2) task offloading phase. In the first phase, a ruin theory-based approach is
developed to obtain the users association considering the users' transmission
reliability and resource utilization efficiency. Meanwhile, in the second
phase, an optimization-based algorithm is used to optimize the data offloading
process. In particular, ruin theory is used to manage the user association
phase, and a ruin probability-based preference profile is considered to control
the priority of proposing users. Here, ruin probability is derived by the
surplus buffer space of each edge node at each time slot. Giving the
association results, an optimization problem is formulated to optimize the
amount of offloaded data aiming at minimizing the energy consumption of users.
Simulation results show that the developed solutions guarantee system
reliability, association efficiency under a tolerable value of surplus buffer
size, and minimize the total energy consumption of all users.

Diff_\partial (D^{2n+1}) \to B Diff (M)$ be the map that is defined by
extending diffeomorphisms on an embedded disc by the identity.
  By a classical result of Farrell and Hsiang, the rational homotopy groups and
the rational homology of $ B Diff_\partial (D^{2n+1})$ are known in the
concordance stable range.
  We prove two results on the behaviour of the map $\mu_M$ in the concordance
stable range. Firstly, it is \emph{injective} on rational homotopy groups, and
secondly, it is \emph{trivial} on rational homology, if $M$ contains
sufficiently many embedded copies of $S^n\times S^{n+1} \setminus

  The homotopical statement is probably not new and follows from the theory of
smooth torsion invariants. The homological statement relies on work by
Botvinnik and Perlmutter on diffeomorphism of odd-dimensional manifolds.

corresponding algorithms are commonly evaluated for interoperability based on
flow-rate fairness. In contrast, video conferencing software such as Zoom uses
custom congestion control algorithms whose fairness behavior is mostly unknown.
Aggravatingly, video conferencing has recently seen a drastic increase in use -
partly caused by the COVID-19 pandemic - and could hence negatively affect how
available Internet resources are shared. In this paper, we thus investigate the
flow-rate fairness of video conferencing congestion control at the example of
Zoom and influences of deploying AQM. We find that Zoom is slow to react to
bandwidth changes and uses two to three times the bandwidth of TCP in
low-bandwidth scenarios. Moreover, also when competing with delay aware
congestion control such as BBR, we see high queuing delays. AQM reduces these
queuing delays and can equalize the bandwidth use when used with flow-queuing.
However, it then introduces high packet loss for Zoom, leaving the question how
delay and loss affect Zoom's QoE. We hence show a preliminary user study in the
appendix which indicates that the QoE is at least not improved and should be
studied further.

inference cost, which scales quadratically with input sequence length. To
address this, we present a novel Learned Token Pruning (LTP) method which
adaptively removes unimportant tokens as an input sequence passes through
transformer layers. In particular, LTP prunes tokens with an attention score
below a threshold value which is learned for each layer during training. Our
threshold-based method allows the length of the pruned sequence to vary
adaptively based on the input sequence, and avoids algorithmically expensive
operations such as top-k token selection. We extensively test the performance
of LTP on GLUE tasks and show that our method outperforms the prior
state-of-the-art token pruning methods by up to ~2.5% higher accuracy with the
same amount of FLOPs. In particular, LTP achieves up to 2.1x FLOPs reduction
with less than 1% accuracy drop, which results in up to 1.9x and 2.0x
throughput improvement on Intel Haswell CPUs and NVIDIA V100 GPUs,
respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate that LTP is more robust than prior
methods to variations on input sentence lengths. Our code has been developed in

digitization and new technologies enable collection and storage of vast amounts
of data, including private data belonging to individuals. To this end, there is
a need for a privacy preserving computation framework that minimises the leak
of private information during computations while being efficient enough for
practical usage. This paper presents a step towards such a framework with the
proposal of a real number secret sharing scheme that works directly on real
numbers without the need for conversion to integers which is the case in
related schemes. The scheme offers computations like addition, multiplication,
and division to be performed directly on secret shared data (the cipher text
version of the data). Simulations show that the scheme is much more efficient
in terms of accuracy than its counterpart version based on integers and finite
field arithmetic. The drawback with the proposed scheme is that it is not
perfectly secure. However, we provide a privacy analysis of the scheme, where
we show that the leaked information can be upper bounded and asymptotically
goes to zero. To demonstrate the scheme, we use it to perform Kalman filtering
directly on secret shared data.

promising materials that host a topological insulator state caused by the
strong electron interactions. Moreover, recent observations of the quantum
oscillations in the insulating state of Kondo insulators have come as a great
surprise. Here, to investigate the surface electronic state of a prototype
Kondo insulator YbB$_{12}$, we measured transport properties of single crystals
and microstructures. In all samples, the temperature dependence of the
electrical resistivity is insulating at high temperatures and the resistivity
exhibits a plateau at low temperatures. The magnitude of the plateau value
decreases with reducing sample thickness, which is quantitatively consistent
with the surface electronic conduction in the bulk insulating YbB$_{12}$.
Moreover, the magnetoresistance of the microstructures exhibits a
weak-antilocalization effect at low field. These results are consistent with
the presence of topologically protected surface state, suggesting that
YbB$_{12}$ is a candidate material of the topological Kondo insulator. The high
field resistivity measurements up to $\mu_0H$ = 50 T of the microstructures
provide supporting evidence that the quantum oscillations of the resistivity in
YbB$_{12}$ occurs in the insulating bulk.

most companies still use simplistic means to calculate necessary safety stock
levels, partly due to the mismatch between existing analytical methods'
emphases on deriving provably optimal solutions and companies' preferences to
sacrifice optimal results in favour of more realistic problem settings. A newly
emerging method from the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), namely
Reinforcement Learning (RL), offers promise in finding optimal solutions while
accommodating more realistic problem features. Unlike analytical-based models,
RL treats the problem as a black-box simulation environment mitigating against
the problem of oversimplifying reality. As such, assumptions on stock keeping
policy can be relaxed and a higher number of problem variables can be
accommodated. While RL has been popular in other domains, its applications in
safety stock optimisation remain scarce. In this paper, we investigate three RL
methods, namely, Q-Learning, Temporal Difference Advantage Actor-Critic and
Multi-agent Temporal Difference Advantage Actor-Critic for optimising safety
stock in a linear chain of independent agents. We find that RL can
simultaneously optimise both safety stock level and order quantity parameters
of an inventory policy, unlike classical safety stock optimisation models where
only safety stock level is optimised while order quantity is predetermined
based on simple rules. This allows RL to model more complex supply chain
procurement behaviour. However, RL takes longer time to arrive at solutions,
necessitating future research on identifying and improving trade-offs between
the use of AI and mathematical models are needed.

several recent investigations have reported different disordered systems to

$\approx$20,000 high-, medium- and low-resolution spectra for $\approx$10,000
RRLs. We provide the analytical forms of radial velocity curve (RVC) templates.
These were built using 36 RRLs (31 fundamental -- split into three period bins
-- and 5 first overtone pulsators) with well-sampled RVCs based on three groups
of metallic lines (Fe, Mg, Na) and four Balmer lines (H$_\alpha$, H$_\beta$,
H$_\gamma$, H$_\delta$).
  We tackled the long-standing problem of the reference epoch to anchor light
curve and RVC templates. For the $V$-band, we found that the residuals of the
templates anchored to the phase of the mean magnitude along the rising branch
are $\sim$35\% to $\sim$45\% smaller than those anchored to the phase of
maximum light. For the RVC, we used two independent reference epochs for
metallic and Balmer lines and we verified that the residuals of the RVC
templates anchored to the phase of mean RV are from 30\% (metallic lines) up to
45\% (Balmer lines) smaller than those anchored to the phase of minimum RV.
  We validated our RVC templates by using both the single- and the three-phase
points approach. We found that barycentric velocities based on our RVC
templates are two-three times more accurate than those available in the
literature. We applied the current RVC templates to Balmer lines RVs of RRLs in
the globular NGC~3201 collected with MUSE at VLT. We found the cluster
barycentric RV of $V_{\gamma}$=496.89$\pm$8.37(error)$\pm$3.43 (standard

However, characterizing elementary localized inhomogeneities of fault zones,

techniques. Resolving these small-scale heterogeneities can provide detailed
information for structural and mechanical models of fault zones. Recently, the
reflection matrix approach utilizing body wave reflections in ambient noise
cross-correlations was extended with the introduction of aberration corrections
to handle the actual lateral velocity variations in the fault zone [Touma et

specular reflectors but also to resolve the presence, location and intensity of

contains a series of style channels, and each channel is bound to a unique and

Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). PINNs are popular machine-learning
templates that allow for seamless integration of physical equation models with

sum of data-fidelity and equation-fidelity objectives. Conflicts between
objectives can arise from scale imbalances, heteroscedasticity in the data,
stiffness of the physical equation, or from catastrophic interference during
sequential training. We explain the training pathology arising from this and
propose a simple yet effective inverse-Dirichlet weighting strategy to
alleviate the issue. We compare with Sobolev training of neural networks,
providing the baseline of analytically $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}$-optimal
training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of inverse-Dirichlet weighting in
various applications, including a multi-scale model of active turbulence, where
we show orders of magnitude improvement in accuracy and convergence over

novel neural network module termed Heterogeneous Information Aggregation
Machine (HIAM), which fully exploits heterogeneous information of historical
data (e.g., incomplete OD matrices, unfinished order vectors, and DO matrices)
to jointly learn the evolutionary patterns of OD and DO ridership.
Specifically, an OD modeling branch estimates the potential destinations of
unfinished orders explicitly to complement the information of incomplete OD
matrices, while a DO modeling branch takes DO matrices as input to capture the
spatial-temporal distribution of DO ridership. Moreover, a Dual Information
Transformer is introduced to propagate the mutual information among OD features
and DO features for modeling the OD-DO causality and correlation. Based on the
proposed HIAM, we develop a unified Seq2Seq network to forecast the future OD

it is often necessary to infer a set of optical aberrations given only the
intensity distribution on the sensor - the problem of phase retrieval. This can
be important for post-processing of existing data, or for the design of optical
phase masks to engineer PSFs optimized to achieve high contrast, angular
resolution, or astrometric stability. By exploiting newly efficient and
flexible technology for automatic differentiation, which in recent years has
undergone rapid development driven by machine learning, we can perform both
phase retrieval and design in a way that is systematic, user-friendly, fast,

viscoelastic fluids, is of great interest. We theoretically study a simple
model for such bath, where two particles are coupled via a sinusoidal
potential. This model, which is an extension of the famous Prandtl Tomlinson
model, has been found to reproduce some aspects of recent experiments, such as
shear-thinning and position oscillations [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 154}, 184904
(2021)]. Analyzing this model in detail, we show that the predicted behavior of
position oscillations agrees qualitatively with experimentally observed trends;
(i) oscillations appear only in a certain regime of velocity and trap stiffness
of the confining potential, and (ii), the amplitude and frequency of
oscillations increase with driving velocity, the latter in a linear fashion.
Increasing the potential barrier height of the model yields a rupture
transition as a function of driving velocity, where the system abruptly changes
from a mildly driven state to a strongly driven state. The frequency of
oscillations scales as $(v_0-v_0^*)^{1/2}$ near the rupture velocity $v_0^*$,
found for infinite trap stiffness. Investigating the (micro-)viscosity for
different parameter ranges, we note that position oscillations leave their
signature by an additional (mild) plateau in the flow curves, suggesting that
oscillations influence the micro-viscosity. For a time-modulated driving, the
mean friction force of the driven particle shows a pronounced resonance
behavior, i.e, it changes strongly as a function of driving frequency. The
model has two known limits: For infinite trap stiffness, it can be mapped to
diffusion in a tilted periodic potential. For infinite bath friction, the
original Prandtl Tomlinson model is recovered. We find that the flow curve of
the model (roughly) crosses over between these two limiting cases.

the largest kissing numbers. The sphere packing density maximization problem is
known to have a solution among well-rounded lattices, of which the integer
lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$ is the simplest example. The integer lattice is also an
example of a generic well-rounded lattice, i.e., a well-rounded lattice with a
minimal kissing number. However, the integer lattice has the worst density
among well-rounded lattices. In this paper, the problem of constructing
explicit generic well-rounded lattices with dense sphere packings is
considered. To this end, so-called tame lattices recently introduced by Damir
et al. are utilized. Tame lattices came to be as a generalization of the ring
of integers of certain abelian number fields. The sublattices of tame lattices
constructed in this paper are shown to always result in either a generic
well-rounded lattice or the lattice $A_n$, with density ranging between that of
$\mathbb{Z}^n$ and $A_n$. Further, explicit deformations of some known densest
lattice packings are constructed, yielding a family of generic well-rounded
lattices with densities arbitrarily close to the optimum. In addition to being
an interesting mathematical problem on its own, the constructions are also
motivated from a more practical point of view. Namely, the constructed lattices
provide good candidates for lattice codes used in secure wireless
communications.

inspired by the MBZIRC 2020 Challenge 1. By utilizing a priori knowledge of the
shape of the intruder's trajectory, we can calculate an interception point.
Target tracking is based on image processing by a YOLOv3 Tiny convolutional
neural network, combined with depth calculation using a gimbal-mounted ZED Mini
stereo camera. We use RGB and depth data from the camera, devising a
noise-reducing histogram-filter to extract the target's 3D position. Obtained
3D measurements of target's position are used to calculate the position,
orientation, and size of a figure-eight shaped trajectory, which we approximate
using a Bernoulli lemniscate. Once the approximation is deemed sufficiently
precise, as measured by the distance between observations and estimate, we
calculate an interception point to position the interceptor UAV directly on the
intruder's path. Our method, which we have significantly improved based on the
experience gathered during the MBZIRC competition, has been validated in
simulation and through field experiments. Our results confirm that we have
developed an efficient, visual-perception module that can extract information
describing the intruder UAV's motion with precision sufficient to support
interception planning. In a majority of our simulated encounters, we can track
and intercept a target that moves 30% faster than the interceptor.

successful results.

instrument however provides poor quality of images due to limitation of

classification. In this paper, we propose a CNN-based technique using transfer

with sliding window is employed to search for location of the eggs. Two

asymptotically true by showing that every $k$-critical graph satisfies
$|E(G)|\geq\left\lceil\left(\frac{k}{2}-\frac{1}{k-1}\right)|V(G)|-\frac{k(k-3)}{2(k-1)}\right\rceil.$
They also characterized the class of graphs that attain this bound and showed
that it is equivalent to the set of $k$-Ore graphs. We show that for any
$k\geq33$ there exists an $\varepsilon>0$ so that if $G$ is a $k$-critical
graph, then
$|E(G)|\geq\left(\frac{k}{2}-\frac{1}{k-1}+\varepsilon_k\right)|V(G)|-\frac{k(k-3)}{2(k-1)}-(k-1)\varepsilon
T(G)$, where $T(G)$ is a measure of the number of disjoint $K_{k-1}$ and
$K_{k-2}$ subgraphs in $G$. This also proves for $k\geq33$ the following
conjecture of Postle regarding the asymptotic density: For every $k\geq4$ there
exists an $\varepsilon_k>0$ such that if $G$ is a $k$-critical $K_{k-2}$-free
graph, then $|E(G)|\geq
\left(\frac{k}{2}-\frac{1}{k-1}+\varepsilon_k\right)|V(G)|-\frac{k(k-3)}{2(k-1)}$.
As a corollary, our result shows that the number of disjoint $K_{k-2}$
subgraphs in a $k$-Ore graph scales linearly with the number of vertices and,
further, that the same is true for graphs whose number of edges is close to
Kostochka and Yancey's bound.

We observed a few morphological changes in Wosret, related to local dust
coating removal with an estimated depth of $\sim$ 1 m, along with the formation
of a cavity measuring 30 m in length and 6.5 m in depth, for a total estimated
mass loss of 1.2 $\times$ 10$^6$ kg. The spectrophotometry of the region is
typical of medium-red regions of comet 67P, with spectral slope values of 15-16
\%/(100 nm) in pre-perihelion data acquired at phase angle 60$^o$. Wosret has a
spectral phase reddening of 0.0546 $\times 10^{-4}$ nm$^{-1} deg^{-1}$, which
is about a factor of 2 lower than what was determined for the nucleus northern
hemisphere regions, possibly indicating a reduced surface micro-roughness due
to the lack of widespread dust coating. A few tiny bright spots are observed.
Morphological features such as ""goosebumps"" or clods are widely present and
larger in size than similar features located in the big lobe. Compared to Anhur
and Khonsu, two southern hemisphere regions in the big lobe which are also
exposed to high insolation during perihelion, Wosret exhibits fewer exposed
volatiles and less morphological variations due to activity events. Our
analysis indicates that the small lobe has different physical and mechanical
properties than the big one and a lower volatile content, at least in its
uppermost layers. These results support the hypothesis that comet 67P
originated from the merging of two distinct bodies in the early Solar System.

have achieved tremendous successes recently, most of them do not consider the
image degradation sufficiently. Firstly, they always assume image noise obeys
an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian or Laplacian
distribution, which largely underestimates the complexity of real noise.
Secondly, previous commonly-used kernel priors (e.g., normalization, sparsity)
are not effective enough to guarantee a rational kernel solution, and thus
degenerates the performance of subsequent SISR task. To address the above
issues, this paper proposes a model-based blind SISR method under the
probabilistic framework, which elaborately models image degradation from the
perspectives of noise and blur kernel. Specifically, instead of the traditional
i.i.d. noise assumption, a patch-based non-i.i.d. noise model is proposed to
tackle the complicated real noise, expecting to increase the degrees of freedom
of the model for noise representation. As for the blur kernel, we novelly
construct a concise yet effective kernel generator, and plug it into the
proposed blind SISR method as an explicit kernel prior (EKP). To solve the
proposed model, a theoretically grounded Monte Carlo EM algorithm is
specifically designed. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
our method over current state-of-the-arts on synthetic and real datasets. The

success of this technique has been related in part to the minimization of

renormalization map should, somewhat counterintuitively, instead be chosen to
minimize the loss of short-range mutual information between a block and its

which indicates that the aims of preserving long-range physics and eliminating

the density of states (DOS) and suppressed conductance in the presence of
ordered magnetic impurities. Here we will consider the dynamical effects on the
DOS and transmission when the magnetic impurities are driven periodically.
Using the Floquet formalism and Green's functions, the system properties are
studied as a function of the driving frequency and the potential energy
contribution of the impurities. We see that increasing the potential part
closes the DOS gap for all driving regimes. The transmission gap is also
closed, showing a pronounced asymmetry as a function of energy. These features
indicate that the dynamical transport properties could yield valuable
information about the magnetic impurities.

Its remarkable advantage lies in that it can impose physical constraints from a
global perspective. In stage one, the original PINN is applied. In stage two,
we additionally introduce the measurement of conserved quantities into mean
squared error loss to train neural networks. This two-stage PINN method is
utilized to simulate abundant localized wave solutions of integrable equations.
We mainly study the Sawada-Kotera equation as well as the coupled equations:
the classical Boussinesq-Burgers equations and acquire the data-driven soliton
molecule, M-shape double-peak soliton, plateau soliton, interaction solution,

data-driven approaches are increasingly used to develop accurate models for

possible to optimize CG models that are also transferable, obtaining optimized
CG force fields (FFs). As a proof of concept, here we use lipids, for which we
can avail of reference experimental data (area per lipid, bilayer thickness)
and reliable atomistic simulations to guide the optimization. Once the
resolution of the CG models (mapping) is set as an input, SwarmCG optimizes the
parameters of the CG lipid models iteratively and simultaneously against
higher-resolution simulations (bottom-up) and experimental data (top-down
references). Including different types of lipid bilayers in the training set in
a parallel optimization guarantees the transferability of the optimized lipid
FF parameters. We demonstrate that SwarmCG can reach satisfactory agreement
with experimental data for different resolution CG FFs. We also obtain
stimulating insights on the precision-resolution balance of the FFs. The
approach is general and can be effectively used to develop new FFs, as well as

inter-band optical transitions and Drude-like absorption. Both photocurrents
saturate at high intensities, but have different intensity dependencies and
saturation intensities. The total photocurrent shows a complex sign-alternating

the optical to near-infrared wavelengths based on a standard dust model; they
assumed a power-law grain-size distribution with an upper cutoff radius and
assumed $graphite$ and $silicate$ as dominant components. As a result, we found
that the upper cutoff radius around Orion A is $\simeq 0.3$ $\rm{\mu}$m, and
$silicate$ predominates compared with $graphite$ (with the fraction of
$silicate$ grater than $93$ %). In addition, we further derived the

detail. Our findings suggest that, while the absence of ghost and gradient
instabilities is indeed essential for physically viable models and so priors
associated with the absence of such instabilities significantly increase the
efficiency of parameter estimations without introducing unphysical biases, this
is not the case for tachyonic instabilities. Even strong such instabilities can
be present without spoiling the cosmological validity of the underlying models.
Therefore, we caution against using exclusion priors based on requiring the
absence of (strong) tachyonic instabilities in deriving cosmological parameter
constraints. We illustrate this by explicitly computing such constraints within
the context of Horndeski theories, while quantifying the size and effect of
related tachyonic instabilities.

Because of its critical role in the energy relaxation process of type II

remains unclear. With the support of electrical transport measurements under
external magnetic fields and irradiation, photon effect on vortex dynamics in
amorphous MoSi (a MoSi) superconducting thin films are investigated in this
work. The magnetic field dependent critical vortex velocity v* derived from the
Larkin Ovchinnikov model is not significantly affected by irradiation. However,
vortex depinning is found to be enhanced by photon-induced reduction in
potential barrier, which mitigates the adverse effect of film inhomogeneity on
superconductivity in the a MoSi thin films. The thorough understanding of the
vortex dynamics in a MoSi thin films under the effect of external stimuli is of
paramount importance for both further fundamental research in this area and

extended in-situ monitoring of detector systems consisting of commercially
available components: EJ-426, a $^6$Li-enriched solid-state scintillator
material sensitive to thermal neutrons, and two different types of Hamamatsu
photomultiplier tubes (PMT). Over the period of eight months, these detectors
were operated in close vicinity to spent nuclear fuel stored at the interim
storage facility CLAB, Oskarshamn, Sweden. At the measurement position the
detectors were continuously exposed to an estimated neutron flux of approx. 280
n/s $\cdot$ cm$^2$ and a gamma-ray dose rate of approx. 6 Sv/h.
  Using offline software algorithms, neutron pulses were identified in the
data. Over the entire investigated dose range of up to 35 kGr, the detector
systems were functioning and were delivering detectable neutron signals. Their
performance as measured by the number of identified neutrons degrades down to
about 30% of the initial value. Investigations of the irradiated components
suggest that this degradation is a result of reduced optical transparency of
the involved materials as well as a reduction of PMT gain due to the continuous
high currents. Increasing the gain of the PMT through step-ups of the applied
high voltage allowed to partially compensate for this loss in detection
sensitivity.
  The integrated neutron fluence during the measurement was experimentally
verified to be in the order of $5 \cdot 10^9$ n/cm$^2$. The results were
interpreted with the help of MCNP6.2 simulations of the setup and the neutron

metals, by determining the escape velocity required by metal-rich stellar and
supernova ejecta to escape the system and avoid being recycled into later
stellar generations. On the other hand, we find no correlation between stellar
age and $M_*/R_\mathrm{e}^2$ (stellar mass surface density $\Sigma$) in the

consider this change in the age--$\Sigma$ relation in the context of the
redshift evolution of the star-forming and quiescent populations in the

galaxies forming more compactly at higher redshifts, and remaining compact
throughout their evolution. Furthermore, galaxies appear to quench at a
characteristic surface density that decreases with decreasing redshift. The
$z\sim 0$ age--$\Sigma$ relation is therefore a result of building up the
quiescent and star-forming populations with galaxies that formed at a range of

analysis of the minimal properly normalized sums of these variances yields
necessary conditions of separability and EPR unsteerability of $(N\, \text{vs}

consider four experimental setups including direct QPT with Pauli eigenvectors

solution for the least-squares estimator of the Choi matrix. We propose a

representing physical quantum channels, and a fast numerical implementation in
the form of the hyperplane intersection projection algorithm. We provide
rigorous, non-asymptotic concentration bounds, sampling complexities and
confidence regions for the Frobenius and trace-norm error of the estimators.
For the Frobenius error, the bounds are linear in the rank of the Choi matrix,
and for low ranks, they improve the error rates of the least squares estimator
by a factor $d^2$, where $d$ is the system dimension. We illustrate the method
with numerical experiments involving channels on systems with up to 7 qubits,

flows coupling the mass conservation of the water component with the energy
conservation and the liquid vapor thermodynamical equilibrium. The
discretization exploits the flexibility of unstructured meshes to model complex
geology including conductive faults as well as complex wells. The polytopal and
essentially nodal Vertex Approximate Gradient scheme is used for the
approximation of the Darcy and Fourier fluxes combined with a Control Volume
approach for the transport of mass and energy. Particular attention is paid to
the faults which are modelled as two-dimensional interfaces defined as
collection of faces of the mesh and to the flow inside deviated or multi-branch
wells defined as collection of edges of the mesh with rooted tree data
structure. By using an explicit pressure drop calculation, the well model
reduces to a single equation based on complementarity constraints with only one
well implicit unknown. The coupled systems are solved fully implicitely at each

numerically on a simple test case with a Cartesian geometry and a single

cancer diagnosis and pathological studies. However, multiple reasons, such as
variations caused by magnification factors and class imbalance, make it a
challenging task where conventional methods that learn from image-label
datasets perform unsatisfactorily in many cases. We observe that tumours of the
same class often share common morphological patterns. To exploit this fact, we
propose an approach that learns similarity-based multi-scale embeddings (SMSE)
for magnification-independent histopathological image classification. In
particular, a pair loss and a triplet loss are leveraged to learn
similarity-based embeddings from image pairs or image triplets. The learned
embeddings provide accurate measurements of similarities between images, which
are regarded as a more effective form of representation for histopathological
morphology than normal image features. Furthermore, in order to ensure the
generated models are magnification-independent, images acquired at different
magnification factors are simultaneously fed to networks during training for
learning multi-scale embeddings. In addition to the SMSE, to eliminate the
impact of class imbalance, instead of using the hard sample mining strategy
that intuitively discards some easy samples, we introduce a new reinforced
focal loss to simultaneously punish hard misclassified samples while
suppressing easy well-classified samples. Experimental results show that the

flux motion. The first model was proposed by Niessen et al. This model works in
the single-vortex approximation and provides qualitative explanation of the
effect, but in most cases it gives an overestimated guiding angle. The
stochastic model explains the experimentally observed effect of decreasing the
guiding angle, the so-called slipping effect, by the influence of thermal
fluctuations. However, the performed estimates show that thermal fluctuations
should not be so significant. An alternative guiding model is the anisotropic
pinning model. This model works in the critical state approximation, and the
slipping effect is the result of the combined action of anisotropic pinning and
vortex interaction. The predictions of all three models are verified by the
example of a superconducting Nb-Ti tape containing about 6 vol. % {/alpha}-Ti,
which acts as strong pinning centers. Cutting samples at different angles to
rolling allows one to control the direction of the driving force. It was found
that when the standard criterion of the electric field is reached, the guiding
angle varies significantly at different places along the sample, which is
explained by the plastic mode of the vortex matter motion. In this case, the
anisotropic pinning model semi-quantitatively predicts the direction angle
averaged over the sample length. With an increase in the driving force, the
vortex matter motion passes into an elastic mode, and the guiding angle becomes
uniform along the sample.

providing the Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) connectivity to the
on-ground user equipment (UEs). Conventional resource allocation algorithms for
the NBIoT systems are particularly designed for terrestrial infrastructures,
where devices are under the coverage of a specific base station and the whole
system varies very slowly in time. The existing methods in the literature
cannot be applied over LEO satellite-based NB-IoT systems for several reasons.
First, with the movement of the LEO satellite, the corresponding channel
parameters for each user will quickly change over time. Delaying the scheduling
of a certain user would result in a resource allocation based on outdated
parameters. Second, the differential Doppler shift, which is a typical
impairment in communications over LEO, directly depends on the relative
distance among users. Scheduling at the same radio frame users that overcome a
certain distance would violate the differential Doppler limit supported by the
NB-IoT standard. Third, the propagation delay over a LEO satellite channel is
around 4-16 times higher compared to a terrestrial system, imposing the need
for message exchange minimization between the users and the base station. In
this work, we propose a novel uplink resource allocation strategy that jointly
incorporates the new design considerations previously mentioned together with
the distinct channel conditions, satellite coverage times and data demands of
various users on Earth. The novel methodology proposed in this paper can act as
a framework for future works in the field.

additive homogeneity renders the Wald estimand equal to the average derivative

Results: Instrument-exposure additive homogeneity is insufficient for ADE
identification when the instrument is binary, the exposure is continuous and
the effect of the exposure on the outcome is non-linear on the additive scale.
For a binary exposure, the exposure-outcome effect is necessarily additive
linear, so the homogeneity condition is sufficient. Conclusions: For binary
instruments, instrument-exposure additive homogeneity identifies the ADE if the
exposure is also binary. Otherwise, additional assumptions (such as additive
linearity of the exposure-outcome effect) are required.

detailed study of the resulting fixed point structure in a projection including
the Einstein-Hilbert action, the fermion anomalous dimension, and a specific
coupling of the fermion bilinears to the spacetime curvature. The latter
constitutes a mass-type term which breaks chiral symmetry explicitly. Our
analysis identifies two infinite families of interacting RG fixed points which
are viable candidates to provide a high-energy completion through the
asymptotic safety mechanism. The fixed points exist for all values of $N_f$
outside of a small window situated at low values $N_f$ and become weakly
coupled in the large $N_f$-limit. Symmetry-wise, they correspond to
""quasi-chiral"" and ""non-chiral"" fixed points. The former come with enhanced
predictive power, fixing one of the couplings via the asymptotic safety
condition. Moreover, the interplay of the fixed points allows for cross-overs
from the non-chiral to the chiral fixed point, giving a dynamical mechanism for
restoring the symmetry approximately at intermediate scales. Our discussion of
chiral symmetry breaking effects provides strong indications that the topology
of spacetime plays a crucial role when analyzing whether quantum gravity admits
light chiral fermions.

arise, and which structures are formed in which type of systems, is still
poorly understood. Particularly, there is a lack of studies investigating the
structure formation in eccentric systems. We aim to improve our understanding
of the wind morphology of eccentric AGB binary systems by investigating the
mechanism responsible for the different small-scale structures and global
morphologies that arise in a polytropic wind with different velocities. Using
the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code Phantom, we generate nine
different high-resolution, 3D simulations of an AGB star with a solar-mass
companion with various wind velocity and eccentricity combinations. The models
assume a polytropic gas, with no additional cooling. We conclude that for
models with a high wind velocity, the short interaction with the companion
results in a regular spiral morphology, that is flattened. In the case of a
lower wind velocity, the stronger interaction results in the formation of a
high-energy region and bow-shock structure that can shape the wind into an
irregular morphology if instabilities arise. High-eccentricity models show a
complex, phase-dependent interaction leading to wind structures that are
irregular in three dimensions. However, the significant interaction with the
companion compresses matter into an equatorial density enhancement,

consider the standard setting of a cavity mode of the quantum radiation field

is ruled by the quantum optical master equation, which is known to have an
exact analytic solution. Starting from a pure input state, we employ two
indicators of how different the initial and evolved states are, namely, the
fidelity of evolution and the Hilbert-Schmidt distance of evolution. The former
was introduced by del Campo {\em et al.} who derived a time-independent speed
limit for the evolution of a Markovian open system. We evaluate it for this
field-reservoir setting, with an arbitrary input pure state of the field mode.
The resultant formula is then specialized to the coherent and Fock states. On
the other hand, we exploit an alternative approach that employs both indicators
of evolution mentioned above. Their rates of change have the same upper bound,
and consequently provide a unique time-dependent quantum speed limit. It turns
out that the associate quantum speed limit time built with the Hilbert-Schmidt
metric is tighter than the fidelity-based one. As apposite applications, we
investigate the damping of the coherent and Fock states by using the
characteristic functions of the corresponding evolved states. General
expressions of both the fidelity and the Hilbert-Schmidt distance of evolution
are obtained and analyzed for these two classes of input states. In the case of

neural networks. While we focus on convolutional networks, our framework can be
extrapolated to any network architecture. In particular, we evaluate two
network properties, namely, capacity, which is related to expressivity, and
compression, which is related to learnability. Both these properties depend
only on the network structure and are independent of the network parameters. To
this end, we propose two metrics: the first one, called layer complexity,
captures the architectural complexity of any network layer; and, the second
one, called layer intrinsic power, encodes how data is compressed along the
network. The metrics are based on the concept of layer algebra, which is also
introduced in this paper. This concept is based on the idea that the global
properties depend on the network topology, and the leaf nodes of any neural
network can be approximated using local transfer functions, thereby, allowing a
simple computation of the global metrics. We show that our global complexity
metric can be calculated and represented more conveniently than the widely-used
VC dimension. We also compare the properties of various state-of-the art
architectures using our metrics and use the properties to analyze their
accuracy on benchmark image classification datasets.

from large eddies to small-scale features directly associated with dissipation.
As the required resolution is not within reach of large scale numerical
simulations, standard strategies involve a smoothing of the fluid dynamics,
either through time averaging or spatial filtering. These strategies raise
formal issues in general relativity, where the split between space and time is
observer dependent. To make progress, we develop a new covariant framework for
filtering/averaging based on the fibration of spacetime associated with fluid
elements and the use of Fermi coordinates to facilitate a meaningful local
analysis. We derive the resolved equations of motion, demonstrating how
""effective"" dissipative terms arise because of the coarse-graining, and paying
particular attention to the thermodynamical interpretation of the resolved
quantities. Finally, as the smoothing of the fluid-dynamics inevitably leads to
a closure problem, we propose a new closure scheme inspired by recent progress
in the modelling of dissipative relativistic fluids, and crucially, demonstrate
the linear stability of the proposed model.

augmentation methods in ideal and non-ideal recording conditions. The
experiments are conducted using a data-set of multi-sensor movement recordings
from 7-month-old infants, as captured by a recently proposed smart jumpsuit for
infant motility assessment. Our results indicate that the choice of the encoder
module has a major impact on classifier performance. For sensor encoders, the
best performance was obtained with parallel 2-dimensional convolutions for
intra-sensor channel fusion with shared weights for all sensors. The results
also indicate that a relatively compact feature representation is obtainable
for within-sensor feature extraction without a drastic loss to classifier
performance. Comparison of time-series models revealed that feed-forward
dilated convolutions with residual and skip connections outperformed all
RNN-based models in performance, training time, and training stability. The
experiments also indicate that data augmentation improves model robustness in
simulated packet loss or sensor dropout scenarios. In particular, signal- and
sensor-dropout-based augmentation strategies provided considerable boosts to
performance without negatively affecting the baseline performance. Overall the
results provide tangible suggestions on how to optimize end-to-end neural

systems world-wide. If energy systems are to become climate neutral and
sustainable, fossil carriers need to be substituted with carbon neutral
alternatives or electrified if possible. We investigate synthetic chemical
energy carriers, H2, CH4, MeOH, NH3 and Fischer-Tropsch fuels (FTF), produced
using electricity from RES as fossil substitutes. [...] We model the sourcing
of feedstock chemicals, synthesis and transport along nine different Energy
Supply Chains to Germany (DE) and compare import options for seven locations
around the world against each other and with domestically sourced alternatives
on the basis of their respective cost per unit of H2 and energy delivered. We
find that for each type of chemical energy carrier, there is an import option
with lower costs compared to domestic production in DE. No single exporting
country or energy carrier has a unique cost advantage, since for each energy
carrier and country there are cost-competitive alternatives. This allows
exporter and infrastructure decisions to be made based on other criteria than
energy and cost. The lowest cost means for importing of energy and H2 are by H2
pipeline from Denmark, Spain and Western Asia and Northern Africa starting at
36 EUR/MWhLHV to 42 EUR/MWh-LHV or 1.0 EUR/kg-H2 to 1.3 EUR/kg-H2 (in 2050,
assuming 5 % p.a. capital cost). For complex energy carriers derived from H2
like CH4, NH3, MeOH or FTF, imports from Argentina by ship to DE are lower cost
than closer exporters in the European Union or Western Asia and Northern
Africa. For meeting H2 demand, direct H2 imports are more attractive than
indirect routes using CH4, MeOH or NH3 imports and subsequent decomposition to
H2 because of high capital investment costs and energetic losses. We make our

$2-70~\mathrm{keV}$ bands in the X-ray. The observed spectral slope in the
near-infrared band is $\nu L_\nu\propto \nu^{0.5\pm0.2}$; the spectral slope
observed in the X-ray band is $\nu L_\nu \propto \nu^{-0.7\pm0.5}$. We tested
synchrotron and synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) scenarios. The observed
near-infrared brightness and X-ray faintness, together with the observed
spectral slopes, pose challenges for all models explored. We rule out a
scenario in which the near-infrared emission is synchrotron emission and the
X-ray emission is SSC. A one-zone model in which both the near-infrared and
X-ray luminosity are produced by SSC and a model in which the luminosity stems
from a cooled synchrotron spectrum can explain the flare. In order to describe
the mean SED, both models require specific values of the maximum Lorentz factor
$\gamma_{max}$, which however differ by roughly two orders of magnitude: the
SSC model suggests that electrons are accelerated to $\gamma_{max}\sim 500$,
while cooled synchrotron model requires acceleration up to
$\gamma_{max}\sim5\times 10^{4}$. The SSC scenario requires electron densities
of $10^{10}~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ much larger than typical ambient densities in the
accretion flow, and thus require in an extraordinary accretion event. In
contrast, assuming a source size of $1R_s$, the cooled synchrotron scenario can
be realized with densities and magnetic fields comparable with the ambient
accretion flow. For both models, the temporal evolution is regulated through
the maximum acceleration factor $\gamma_{max}$, implying that sustained
particle acceleration is required to explain at least a part of the temporal
evolution of the flare.

two-dimensional transition metal oxide superconductors by analyzing not only
the role played by conventional singlet pairings, but also by the triplet order
parameters, favored by the spin-orbit couplings present in these ma- terials.
In particular, we focus on the two-dimensional electron gas at the (001)
interface between LaAlO3 and SrTiO3 band insulators where the low electron
densities and the sizeable spin-orbit couplings affect the superconducting
features. Our theoretical study is based on an extended su- perconducting
mean-field analysis of the typical multi-band tight-binding Hamiltonian, as
well as on a parallel analysis of the effective electronic bands in the
low-momentum limit, including static on-site and inter-site intra-band
attractive potentials under applied magnetic fields. The presence of triplet
pairings is able to strongly reduce the singlet order parameters which, as a
result, are no longer a monotonic function of the charge density. The interplay
between the singlet and the triplet pairings affects the dispersion of
quasi-particle excitations in the Brillouin zone and also induces anisotropy in
the superconducting behavior under the action of an in-plane and of an out-
of-plane magnetic fields. Finally, non-trivial topological superconducting
states become stable as a function of the charge density, as well as of the
magnitude and of the orientation of the magnetic field. In addition to the
chiral, time-reversal breaking, topological superconducting phase, favored by
the linear Rashba couplings and by the on-site attractive potentials in the

the main characteristics of a network satisfying requirements on connectivity,
capacity, and level-of-service. It finds applications in logistics and
transportation, telecommunications, data sharing, energy distribution, and
distributed computing. In multi-commodity network design, one is required to
design a network minimizing the installation cost of its arcs and the
operational cost to serve a set of point-to-point connections. The definition
of this prototypical problem was recently enriched by additional constraints
imposing that each origin-destination of a connection is served by a single
path satisfying one or more level-of-service requirements, thus defining the
Network Design with Service Requirements [Balakrishnan, Li, and Mirchandani.
Operations Research, 2017]. These constraints are crucial, e.g., in
telecommunications and computer networks, in order to ensure reliable and
low-latency communication. In this paper we provide a new formulation for the
problem, where variables are associated with paths satisfying the end-to-end
service requirements. We present a fast algorithm for enumerating all the
exponentially-many feasible paths and, when this is not viable, we provide a
column generation scheme that is embedded into a branch-and-cut-and-price
algorithm. Extensive computational experiments on a large set of instances show
that our approach is able to move a step further in the solution of the Network
Design with Service Requirements, compared with the current state-of-the-art.

scrambling. Generalized quantum subsystems are described by an hermitian-closed
unital subalgebra $\cal A$ of operators evolving through a unitary channel.
Qualitatively, quantum scrambling is defined by how the associated physical
degrees of freedom get mixed up with others by the dynamics. Quantitatively,
this is accomplished by introducing a measure, the geometric algebra
anti-correlator (GAAC), of the self-orthogonalization of the commutant of $\cal
A$ induced by the dynamics. This approach extends and unifies averaged
bipartite OTOC, operator entanglement, coherence generating power and Loschmidt
echo. Each of these concepts is indeed recovered by a special choice of $\cal
A$. We compute typical values of GAAC for random unitaries, we prove upper
bounds and characterize their saturation. For generic energy spectrum we find
explicit expressions for the infinite-time average of the GAAC which encode the
relation between $\cal A$ and the full system of Hamiltonian eigenstates.
Finally, a notion of ${\cal A}$-chaoticity is suggested.

efficient at test time, requiring just a few optimization steps or single
forward pass to learn a new task, but they remain highly memory-intensive to
train. This limitation arises because a task's entire support set, which can
contain up to 1000 images, must be processed before an optimization step can be
taken. Harnessing the performance gains offered by large images thus requires
either parallelizing the meta-learner across multiple GPUs, which may not be
available, or trade-offs between task and image size when memory constraints
apply. We improve on both options by proposing LITE, a general and memory
efficient episodic training scheme that enables meta-training on large tasks
composed of large images on a single GPU. We achieve this by observing that the
gradients for a task can be decomposed into a sum of gradients over the task's
training images. This enables us to perform a forward pass on a task's entire
training set but realize significant memory savings by back-propagating only a
random subset of these images which we show is an unbiased approximation of the
full gradient. We use LITE to train meta-learners and demonstrate new
state-of-the-art accuracy on the real-world ORBIT benchmark and 3 of the 4
parts of the challenging VTAB+MD benchmark relative to leading meta-learners.
LITE also enables meta-learners to be competitive with transfer learning
approaches but at a fraction of the test-time computational cost, thus serving
as a counterpoint to the recent narrative that transfer learning is all you
need for few-shot classification.

explore the sparsity acquiring properties of a general penalized CGM (P-CGM)
for convex regularizers and a reweighted penalized CGM (RP-CGM) for nonconvex
regularizers, replacing the usual convex constraints with gauge-inspired
penalties. This generalization does not increase the per-iteration complexity
noticeably. Without assuming bounded iterates or using line search, we show
$O(1/t)$ convergence of the gap of each subproblem, which measures distance to
a stationary point. We couple this with a screening rule which is safe in the
convex case, converging to the true support at a rate $O(1/(\delta^2))$ where
$\delta \geq 0$ measures how close the problem is to degeneracy. In the
nonconvex case the screening rule converges to the true support in a finite

from the nebular shells. We have determined the electron temperatures for
spatially resolved, optically thick nebulae. These temperatures are 20 to 60%
lower than those estimated from collisionally excited optical emission lines.
This strongly supports the existence of a cold plasma component, which
co-exists with hot plasma in planetary nebulae. This cold plasma does not
contribute to the collisionally excited lines, but does contribute to
recombination lines and radio flux. Neither of the plasma components are
spatially resolved in our images, although we infer that the cold plasma
extends to the outer radii of planetary nebulae. However, more cold plasma
appears to exist at smaller radii. The presence of cold plasma should be taken
into account in modeling of radio emission of planetary nebulae. Modelling of
radio emission usually uses electron temperatures calculated from collisionally
excited optical and/or infrared lines. This may lead to an underestimate of the
ionized mass and an overestimate of the extinction correction from planetary
nebulae when derived from the radio flux alone. The correction improves the
consistency of extinction derived from the radio fluxes when compared to
estimates from the Balmer decrement flux ratios.

leakage to formalize privacy against a brute-force guessing adversary. The
information is measured by non-probabilistic uncertainty of uncertain
variables, the non-stochastic counterparts of random variables. For $X$ that is
related to released data $Y$, the non-stochastic brute-force leakage is
measured by the complexity of exhaustively checking all the possibilities of
the private attribute $U$ of $X$ by an adversary. The complexity refers to the
number of trials to successfully guess $U$. Maximizing this leakage over all
possible private attributes $U$ gives rise to the maximal (i.e., worst-case)
non-stochastic brute-force guessing leakage. This is proved to be fully
determined by the minimal non-stochastic uncertainty of $X$ given $Y$, which
also determines the worst-case attribute $U$ indicating the highest privacy
risk if $Y$ is disclosed. The maximal non-stochastic brute-force guessing
leakage is shown to be proportional to the non-stochastic identifiability of
$X$ given $Y$ and upper bounds the existing maximin information. The latter
quantifies the information leakage when an adversary must perfectly guess $U$
in one-shot via $Y$. Experiments are used to demonstrate the tradeoff between
the maximal non-stochastic brute-force guessing leakage and the data utility
(measured by the maximum quantization error) and to illustrate the relationship
between maximin information and stochastic one-shot maximal leakage.

applied to the EUREGIO inter-regional trade dataset and then to an

threshold and a multiscale backbone network. The results show that the WNGF
generates valid results, consistent with those of the dichotomized network. In
addition, it provides the following advantages: (i) it ensures information
retention, (ii) since no alterations and decisions have to be made on how to
dichotomize the network, the WNGF frees the user from the burden of making
assumptions, (iii) it provides a nuanced understanding of each node's brokerage
role. These advantages are of special importance when the role of less

illustrative purposes. Possible applications of WNGF span beyond regional and

important, for example by accounting for persisting or repeating edges compared
to one-time interactions. WNGF can also be used to further analyze networks
that measure how often people meet, talk, text, like, or retweet. WNGF makes a
relevant methodological contribution as it offers a way to analyze brokerage in
weighted, directed, and even complete graphs without information loss that can

Decarbonising the power sector is now at the centre of global and European
policies. As the IPCC highlights, pathways where the power sector rapidly
decarbonises by 2030 have higher chances of keeping global warming below
1.5$^\circ$C. The electricity sector should be fully decarbonised by 2050 to
meet either the 1.5$^\circ$C or 2$^\circ$C targets. This means that EU policy
efforts should focus on supporting a maximum reduction of emissions per unit of
electricity by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050. Reaching these targets is
one of the most pressing questions EU policymakers face today. In light of the
COVID-19 crisis, EU policies should guide a cost-effective, reliable and
environmentally sound transition of the power sector, benefiting EU research
and innovation and its citizens. This meta-analysis provides a novel view on
historical data and compares data from modelling scenarios identified in the
literature. It assesses the current and future role of nuclear energy in
decarbonizing the EU power sector, while reviewing socio-economic implications
that could arise if limited public support nearly excludes nuclear fission
electricity from the future EU power mix. This work highlights relevant
socio-economic policy implications and actionable policy recommendations.

that its subsystem interactions can be solely determined from experiment data
or reconstructed from its overall model. The NDS is constituted from several
subsystems whose dynamics are described through a descriptor form. Except
regularity on each subsystem and the whole NDS, no other restrictions are put
on either subsystem dynamics or subsystem interactions. A matrix rank based
necessary and sufficient condition is derived for the global identifiability of
subsystem interactions, which leads to several conclusions about NDS structure
identifiability when there is some a priori information. This matrix also gives
an explicit description for the set of subsystem interactions that can not be
distinguished from experiment data only. In addition, under a well-posedness
assumption, a necessary and sufficient condition is obtained for the
reconstructibility of subsystem interactions from an NDS descriptor form model.
This condition can be verified with each subsystem separately and is therefore
attractive in the analysis and synthesis of a large-scale NDS. Simulation
results show that rather than increases monotonically with the distance of
subsystem interactions to the undifferentiable set, the magnitude of the
external output differences between two NDSs with distinct subsystem
interactions increases much more rapidly when one of them is close to be
unstable. In addition, directions of probing signals are also very important in
distinguishing external outputs of distinctive NDSs.These findings are expected
to be helpful in identification experiment designs, etc.

suitable architecture can be trained to solve inverse imaging problems by
simply optimizing it's parameters to reconstruct a single degraded image.
However, it suffers from two practical limitations. First, it remains unclear
how to control the prior beyond the choice of the network architecture. Second,
training requires an oracle stopping criterion as during the optimization the
performance degrades after reaching an optimum value. To address these
challenges we introduce a frequency-band correspondence measure to characterize
the spectral bias of the deep image prior, where low-frequency image signals
are learned faster and better than high-frequency counterparts. Based on our
observations, we propose techniques to prevent the eventual performance
degradation and accelerate convergence. We introduce a Lipschitz-controlled
convolution layer and a Gaussian-controlled upsampling layer as plug-in
replacements for layers used in the deep architectures. The experiments show
that with these changes the performance does not degrade during optimization,
relieving us from the need for an oracle stopping criterion. We further outline
a stopping criterion to avoid superfluous computation. Finally, we show that
our approach obtains favorable results compared to current approaches across
various denoising, deblocking, inpainting, super-resolution and detail

solve hyperbolic equations with discontinuous solutions and random
uncertainties. The main computational challenges for such problems include
discontinuities of the solutions and the curse of dimensionality due to
uncertainties. Deep learning techniques have been favored for high-dimensional
problems but face difficulties when the solution is not smooth, thus have so
far been mainly used for viscous hyperbolic system that admits only smooth
solutions. We alleviate this difficulty by setting up the loss function using
discrete shock capturing schemes--the discontinous Galerkin method as an
example--since the solutions are smooth in the discrete space. The convergence
of D2GM is established via the Lax equivalence theorem kind of argument. The
high-dimensional random space is handled by the Monte-Carlo method. Such a
setup makes the D2GM approximate high-dimensional functions over the random
space with satisfactory accuracy at reasonable cost. The D2GM is found
numerically to be first-order and second-order accurate for (stochastic) linear
conservation law with smooth solutions using piecewise constant and piecewise
linear basis functions, respectively. Numerous examples are given to verify the
efficiency and the robustness of D2GM with the dimensionality of random
variables up to $200$ for (stochastic) linear conservation law and (stochastic)

individual subshells with $N$ equivalent electrons of momentum $j$. An
expression as a nth-derivative is provided for the generating function of the
$J$ distribution and efficient recurrence relations are established. It is
shown that this distribution may be represented by a Gram-Charlier-like series
which is derived from the corresponding series for the magnetic quantum number
distribution. The numerical efficiency of this expansion is fair when the
configuration consists of several subshells, while the accuracy is less good
when only one subshell is involved. An analytical expression is given for the
odd-order momenta while the even-order ones are expressed as a series which
provides an acceptable accuracy though being not convergent. Such expressions
may be used to obtain approximate values for the number of transitions in a

data that brings similar pairs together while keeping dissimilar data away from
each other. To this end, many different methods are proposed in the last decade
with promising results in various applications. The success of a DML algorithm
greatly depends on its loss function. However, no loss function is perfect, and
it deals only with some aspects of an optimal similarity embedding. Besides,
the generalizability of the DML on unseen categories during the test stage is
an important matter that is not considered by existing loss functions. To
address these challenges, we propose novel approaches to combine different
losses built on top of a shared deep feature extractor. The proposed ensemble
of losses enforces the deep model to extract features that are consistent with
all losses. Since the selected losses are diverse and each emphasizes different
aspects of an optimal semantic embedding, our effective combining methods yield
a considerable improvement over any individual loss and generalize well on
unseen categories. Here, there is no limitation in choosing loss functions, and
our methods can work with any set of existing ones. Besides, they can optimize
each loss function as well as its weight in an end-to-end paradigm with no need
to adjust any hyper-parameter. We evaluate our methods on some popular datasets

Theoretically, we show that the FLO estimator is tight, and it provably

utility of FLO is verified using an extensive set of benchmarks, which also

equipped with a set of camera-based vision sensors, also known as Visual IoT

made for achieving programmable communication, computation, and control.
However, they are conducted mainly in the silo mode, limiting the
responsiveness and efficiency of handling challenging scenarios in the real

require the co-design of communication, computation, and control. This paper
presents our vision of the end-to-end design principle for CAVs, called 4C,
which extends the V-IoT system by providing a unified communication,
computation, and control co-design framework. With programmable communications,
fine-grained heterogeneous computation, and efficient vehicle controls in 4C,
CAVs can handle critical scenarios and achieve energy-efficient autonomous
driving. Finally, we present several challenges to achieving the vision of the

transformations, tuning parameters, and parallelization strategies. To cover
the huge search space, code generation frameworks may apply time-intensive
autotuning, exploit scenario-specific performance models, or treat performance
as an intangible black box that must be described via machine learning.
  This paper addresses the selection problem by identifying the relevant
performance-defining mechanisms through a performance model coupled with an
analytic hardware metric estimator. This enables a quick exploration of large
configuration spaces to identify highly efficient candidates with high
accuracy.
  Our current approach targets memory-intensive GPGPU applications and focuses
on the correct modeling of data transfer volumes to all levels of the memory
hierarchy. We show how our method can be coupled to the pystencils stencil code
generator, which is used to generate kernels for a range four 3D25pt stencil

both, it delivers a ranking that can be used to select the best performing
candidate.
  The method is not limited to stencil kernels, but can be integrated into any

Subsequently, the importance and need for an evolution outlier detection method

  wakefields",,,,,"physics.plasm-ph physics.acc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Accelerating particles to high energies in plasma wakefields is considered to
be a promising technique with good energy efficiency and high gradient. While
important progress has been made in plasma-based electron acceleration,
positron acceleration in plasma has been scarcely studied and a fully
self-consistent and optimal scenario has not yet been identified. For high
energy physics applications where an electron-positron collider would be
desired, the ability to accelerate positrons in plasma wakefields is however
paramount. Here we show that the preservation of beam quality can be
compromised in a plasma wakefield loaded with a positron beam, and a trade-off
between energy efficiency and beam quality needs to be found. For electron
beams driving linear plasma wakefields, we have found that despite the
transversely nonlinear focusing force induced by positron beam loading, the
bunch quickly evolves toward an equilibrium distribution with limited emittance
growth. Particle-in-cell simulations show that for {\mu}m-scale normalized
emittance, the growth of uncorrelated energy spread sets an important limit.
Our results demonstrate that the linear or moderately nonlinear regimes with
Gaussian drivers provide a good trade-off, achieving simultaneously
energy-transfer efficiencies exceeding 30% and uncorrelated energy spread below
1%, while donut-shaped drivers in the nonlinear regime are more appropriate to
accelerate high-charge bunches at higher gradients, at the cost of a degraded
trade-off between efficiency and beam quality.

understand the mechanics of PNN, mechanical properties of different PNN
components such as glycan, GAG, and protein need to be evaluated. In this
study, we evaluated the mechanical strength of PNN molecules and the
interfacial strength between the components of PNN. Afterward, we have assessed
the PNN molecules' damage efficiency at various conditions such as shock speed,
preexisting bubble, and boundary conditions. The secondary structure
altercation of the protein molecules of the PNN has been analyzed to evaluate
damage intensity under varying shock loading. At higher shock speed, damage
intensity is more elevated, and hyaluronan is most likely to break at the rigid
junction. The primary structure of the protein molecules is most unlikely to
fail. Instead, the molecules' secondary bonds will be altered. Our study
suggests that the number of hydrogen bonds during the shock wave propagation
decreased.

this work, we reveal mathematically why contrastive learners fail in the

longer explicitly appeals to a discriminative classification goal for
contrastive learning. Theoretically, we show FlatNCE is the mathematical dual
formulation of InfoNCE, thus bridging the classical literature on energy
modeling; and empirically, we demonstrate that, with minimal modification of
code, FlatNCE enables immediate performance boost independent of the
subject-matter engineering efforts. The significance of this work is furthered
by the powerful generalization of contrastive learning techniques, and the
introduction of new tools to monitor and diagnose contrastive training. We
substantiate our claims with empirical evidence on CIFAR10, ImageNet, and other

$\lambda$-calculus extended with a graded monad for probabilities and state.
The grading is used to model and restrict the memory footprint and the cost (in
terms of oracle calls) of computations. Under this view, an adversary is a
higher-order expression that expects as arguments the code of its oracles. We
develop unary program logics for reasoning about error probabilities and
expected values, and a relational logic for reasoning about coupling-based

guarantees that are valid for all adversaries that satisfy a fixed resource
policy. We prove the soundness of the logics in the category of quasi-Borel
spaces, using a general notion of graded predicate liftings, and we use logical
relations over graded predicate liftings to establish the soundness of proof

In this paper we formalize active preference-based learning from the human's

enables robots to use questions to make their learning process transparent to

sky brightness resulting from a countywide lighting retrofit project. The
retrofit took place in Chelan County, a gateway community to North Cascades
National Park and Lake Chelan National Recreation Area in Washington State. The
county retrofitted all 3,693 county-owned high pressure sodium (HPS) street
lamps to full cutoff LEDs. This number is about 60% of the County's total
outdoor street and area lights. About 80% of the newly installed lights were
3000K in color temperature and 20% were 4000K. The 4000K LEDs were used to meet
Washington State Department of Transportation guidelines. To measure sky
brightness, we used the NPS night sky camera system before the retrofit started
in 2018 and after its completion in 2019. These images were photometrically
calibrated and mosaicked together to provide hemispherical images in V band.
For comparison with our ground-based measurement, we obtained the satellite
imagery taken by Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the
Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite. Our measurements show that
the post-retrofit skyglow became brighter and extended higher in the sky, but
upward radiance, as measured by the day-night band radiometer, decreased. These
divergent results are likely explained by a substantial increase in light
emitted at wavelengths shorter than 500 nm, and a relative decrease in zenith
light emission due to better shielded luminaires. These results also
demonstrate that earlier models relating VIIRS day-night band data to skyglow
will, at a minimum, require substantial revision to account for the different
characteristics of solid state luminaires.

or precipitation from hotter phases. We obtain the analytic solution for a
steady pressure-driven 1-D cooling flow around cold, local over-densities,
irrespective of their origin. Our solutions describe the slow and steady
radiative cooling-driven gas inflow in the saturated regime of nonlinear
thermal instability in clouds, sheets and filaments. Such a cooling flow
develops when the gas around small clumps undergoes radiative cooling. These
small-scale, cold `seeds' are embedded in a large volume-filling hot CGM
maintained by feedback. We use a simple two-fluid treatment to include magnetic
fields as an additional polytropic fluid. To test the limits of applicability
of these analytic solutions, we compare with the gas structure found in and
around small-scale cold clouds in the CGM of massive halos in the TNG50
cosmological MHD simulation from the IllustrisTNG suite. Despite qualitative
resemblance of the gas structure, we find deviations from steady state profiles
generated by our model. Complex geometries and turbulence all add complexity
beyond our analytic solutions. We derive an exact relation between the mass
cooling rate ($\dot{\rm M}_{\rm cool}$) and the radiative cooling rate
($\dot{\rm E}_{\rm cool}$) for a steady cooling flow. A comparison with the
TNG50 clouds shows that this cooling flow relation only applies in a narrow
temperature range around $\rm \sim 10^{4.5}$ K where the isobaric cooling time
is the shortest. In general, turbulence and mixing, instead of radiative
cooling, may dominate the transition of gas between different temperature
phases.

Land Surface Temperature, and El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation indices in 32
different cantons, using dengue surveillance from 2000 to 2019. Results showed
that the dengue dominant cycles are in periods of 1, 2, and 3 years. The

extraction of latent variables representing the characteristics of lithium-ion
batteries (LIBs) from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data using
information maximizing generative adversarial networks. Meaningful
representations can be obtained from EIS data even when measured with direct
current and without relaxation, which are difficult to express when using
circuit models. The extracted latent variables were investigated as capacity
degradation progressed and were used to estimate the discharge capacity of the
batteries by employing Gaussian process regression. The proposed method was
validated under various conditions of EIS data during charging and discharging.
The results indicate that the proposed model provides more robust capacity

demonstrate that the latent variables extracted from the EIS data measured with

experimental campaigns in which the static chamber pressure and fuel-oxidizer
ratio are varied such that the first tangential mode of the combustor is
excited under some conditions. We train an autoregressive Bayesian neural
network model to forecast the amplitude of the dynamic pressure time series,
inputting multiple sensor measurements (injector pressure/ temperature
measurements, static chamber pressure, high-frequency dynamic pressure
measurements, high-frequency OH* chemiluminescence measurements) and future
flow rate control signals. The Bayesian nature of our algorithms allows us to
work with a dataset whose size is restricted by the expense of each
experimental run, without making overconfident extrapolations. We find that the
networks are able to accurately forecast the evolution of the pressure
amplitude and anticipate instability events on unseen experimental runs 500
milliseconds in advance. We compare the predictive accuracy of multiple models
using different combinations of sensor inputs. We find that the high-frequency
dynamic pressure signal is particularly informative. We also use the technique
of integrated gradients to interpret the influence of different sensor inputs
on the model prediction. The negative log-likelihood of data points in the test

In this work, we first explain how the spatial correlation structure of the

landscapes worldwide with diverse hydroclimatic forcings and geologic histories
using 24 Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and compare them with complex terrain

covariance structure captures the observed spatial correlation in these cases
with the peak frequency distribution agreeing well with the elevation frequency
distribution. The ratio of the pit-over-peak (POP) count is linked to the
degree to which the pit and peak frequency distributions match, and carries the
mark of landscape aging. The relationship between the geomorphic development
stage (quantified by the reduced fatness of the slope-distribution tail) and
the deviation of POP values from unity in old mountainous landscapes confirms
that the evolution towards smoother topographies is atypically accompanied by
reduced pit counts typical of organized valley and ridge patterns.

  Applications",,,,,"physics.app-ph physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Artificially created media allow employing material parameters as additional
valuable degrees of freedom in tailoring electromagnetic scattering. In
particular, metamaterials with either negative permeability or permittivity
allow creating deeply subwavelength resonant structures with relatively high
scattering crosssections. However, the equivalence principle allows replacing
volumetric structures with properly designed curved impedance surfaces,
ensuring the same electromagnetic properties. Here, we examine this statement
from a practical standpoint, considering two structures, having a dipolar
electric resonance at the same frequency. The first realization is based on
arrays of inductively loaded electric dipoles printed on stacked circuit boards
(a volumetric metamaterial), while the second structure utilizes a 4-wire
spiral on a spherical surface (surface impedance realization). An intermediate
conclusion is that the surface implementation tends to outperform the
volumetric counterparts in the scenario when a single resonance is involved.
However, in the case where multiple resonances are overlapping and lossy
materials are involved, volumetric realization can have an advantage. The
discussed structures are of significant importance to the field of electrically
small antennas, superdirective antennas, and superscatterers, which find use in
wireless communications and radar applications, to name just a few.

waveguide filters based on locally resonant metamaterials (LRMs). We implement
ultra-small metamaterial filters (Meta-filters) by exploiting a subwavelength
(sub-lambda guiding mechanism in evanescent hollow waveguides, which are loaded
by small resonators. In particular, we use composite pin-pipe waveguides
(CPPWs) built from a hollow metallic pipe loaded by a set of resonant pins,
which are spaced by deep subwavelength distances. We demonstrate that in such
structures, multiple resonant scattering nucleates a sub-lambda mode with a
customizable bandwidth below the induced hybridization bandgap (HBG) of the
LRM. The sub-lambda guided mode and the HBG, respectively, induce pass- and
rejection- bands in a finite-length CPPW, creating a filter whose main
properties are largely decoupled from the specific arrangement of the resonant
inclusions. To guarantee compatibility with existing technologies, we propose a
unique subwavelength method to match the small CPPW filters to standard
waveguide interfaces, which we call a meta-port. Finally, we build and test a
family of low- and high-order ultra-compact aluminum CPPW filters in the
Ku-band (10-18GHz). Our measurements demonstrate the customizability of the
bandwidth and the robustness of the passband against geometrical scaling. The
3D-printed prototypes, which are one order of magnitude smaller and lighter
than traditional filters and are also compatible with standard waveguide

wave equation to describe the physical system in which subatomic particles play
random motion, thereby leading to quantum mechanics. The physical reality
described by the wave function is subatomic particle moving randomly.
Therefore, the characteristics of quantum mechanics have a dual nature, one of
them is the deterministic nature carried on from classical physics, and the
other is the probabilistic nature coined by particle's random motion. Based on
this model, almost all of open questions in quantum mechanics can be explained
consistently, which include the particle-wave duality, the principle of quantum
superposition, the interference pattern of double-slit experiments, and the
boundary between the classical world and the quantum world. The current quantum
mechanics is a mixture of matrix mechanics and wave mechanics, which are
sharply conflicting in principle. Matrix mechanics treats quantum particles as
classical particles with fixed relation between the particle's position and its
momentum. The matrix mechanics, in fact, belongs to the old quantum theory.
Both Born's non-commutative relation and Heisenberg uncertainty relation
originate from matrix mechanics. However, in wave mechanics, there is no any
fixed relation between the particle's position and its momentum, and the
particle's position and its momentum belong to immeasurable physical
quantities. Therefore, there is no need for non-commutative relation and
uncertainty relation in wave mechanics.

activities. Besides the loss of human lives and agony faced by humankind, the
pandemic has badly hit different sectors economically, including the travel
industry. Special arrangements, including COVID test before departure and on
arrival, and voluntary quarantine, were enforced to limit the risk of
transmission. However, the hope for returning to a normal (pre-COVID) routine
relies on the success of the current COVID vaccination drives administered by
different countries. To open for tourism and other necessary travel, a need is
realized for a universally accessible proof of COVID vaccination, allowing
travelers to cross the borders without any hindrance. This paper presents an
architectural framework for a GDPR-compliant blockchain-based COVID vaccination
passport (VacciFi), whilst considering the relevant developments, especially in
the European Union region.
