respiratory tract infection (RTI), are among the most common diseases in
clinics. The similarities among the symptoms of these diseases precludes prompt
diagnosis upon the patients' arrival. In pediatrics, the patients' limited
ability in expressing their situation makes precise diagnosis even harder. This
becomes worse in primary hospitals, where the lack of medical imaging devices
and the doctors' limited experience further increase the difficulty of
distinguishing among similar diseases. In this paper, a pediatric fine-grained
diagnosis-assistant system is proposed to provide prompt and precise diagnosis
using solely clinical notes upon admission, which would assist clinicians
without changing the diagnostic process. The proposed system consists of two
stages: a test result structuralization stage and a disease identification
stage. The first stage structuralizes test results by extracting relevant
numerical values from clinical notes, and the disease identification stage
provides a diagnosis based on text-form clinical notes and the structured data
obtained from the first stage. A novel deep learning algorithm was developed
for the disease identification stage, where techniques including adaptive
feature infusion and multi-modal attentive fusion were introduced to fuse
structured and text data together. Clinical notes from over 12000 patients with
respiratory diseases were used to train a deep learning model, and clinical
notes from a non-overlapping set of about 1800 patients were used to evaluate
the performance of the trained model. The average precisions (AP) for
pneumonia, RTI, bronchitis and asthma are 0.878, 0.857, 0.714, and 0.825,

surface micro-geometry, they can be used to detect surface defects that are not

structures are extracted from the DNS data using wavenumber and frequency
spectra, and spectral peaks, which comprise near-wall, large-scale and
spanwise-coherent structures, are further analyzed using spectral proper
orthogonal decomposition (SPOD). SPOD analysis, employing a pressure inner
product, show a strong dominance of the leading mode, highlighting low-rank
behaviour of pressure fluctuations. The leading resolvent mode, considering
pressure as output, agrees closely with the first SPOD mode, providing support
to recent studies that showed better performance of resolvent-based estimators
when predicting pressure fluctuations compared to velocity structures (Amaral

generation of streamwise or spanwise vortices, with pressure fluctuations
appearing close to vortex centers. A study on the nonlinear terms individual

challenging. The emergence of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite systems has been
seen as a potential solution for connecting remote areas. Despite the hype
around these new technologies, we still lack an open-source modeling framework
for assessing the techno-economics of satellite broadband connectivity which is
therefore the purpose of this paper. Firstly, a generalizable techno-economic
model is presented to assess the engineering-economics of satellite
constellations. Secondly, the approach is applied to assess the three main
competing LEO constellations which include Starlink, OneWeb and Kuiper. This
involves simulating the impact on coverage, capacity and cost as both the
number of satellites and quantity of subscribers increases. Finally, a global
assessment is undertaken visualizing the potential capacity and cost per user
via different subscriber scenarios. The results demonstrate how limited the
capacity will be once resources are spread across users in each satellite
coverage area. For example, if there is 1 user per 10 km^2 we estimate a mean
per user capacity of 24.94 Mbps, 1.01 Mbps and 10.30 Mbps for Starlink, OneWeb
and Kuiper respectively in the busiest hour of the day. But if the subscriber
density increases to 1 user per km^2, then the mean per user capacity drops
significantly to 2.49 Mbps, 0.10 Mbps and 1.02 Mbps for Starlink, OneWeb and
Kuiper respectively. LEO broadband will be an essential part of the
connectivity toolkit, but the results reveal that these mega-constellations
will most likely have to operate below 0.1 users per km^2 to provide a service
that outcompetes other broadband connectivity options. The open-source codebase
which the paper contributes is provided with the hope that other engineers will
access, use, and further develop the satellite assessment capability.

with lattice quantum chromodynamics using a variational approach. A wide range
of interpolating operators are used: dibaryon operators built from products of
plane-wave nucleons, hexaquark operators built from six localized quarks, and
quasi-local operators inspired by two-nucleon bound-state wavefunctions in
low-energy effective theories. Sparsening techniques are used to compute the
timeslice-to-all quark propagators required to form correlation-function
matrices using products of these operators. Projection of these matrices onto
irreducible representations of the cubic group, including spin-orbit coupling,
is detailed. Variational methods are applied to constrain the low-energy
spectra of two-nucleon systems in a single finite volume with quark masses
corresponding to a pion mass of 806 MeV. Results for S- and D-wave phase shifts
in the isospin singlet and triplet channels are obtained under the assumption
that partial-wave mixing is negligible. Tests of interpolating-operator
dependence are used to investigate the reliability of the energy spectra
obtained and highlight both the strengths and weaknesses of variational
methods. These studies and comparisons to previous studies using the same
gauge-field ensemble demonstrate that interpolating-operator dependence can
lead to significant effects on the two-nucleon energy spectra obtained using
both variational and non-variational methods, including missing energy levels
and other discrepancies. While this study is inconclusive regarding the
presence of two-nucleon bound states at this quark mass, it provides robust
upper bounds on two-nucleon energy levels that can be improved in future
calculations using additional interpolating operators and is therefore a step
toward reliable nuclear spectroscopy from the underlying Standard Model of
particle physics.

an emerging desalination method. Here, we investigate the dynamic behavior of
water, sodium, and chloride ions inside GO membrane using a computational
approach. First, we developed four different models of GO membrane with
different distances between GO sheets (0.7, 0.9, 1.1, and 1.3 nm), and
performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of water inside each membrane for
20 ns. With the analysis of the mean squared displacement of water and the
Einstein relation equation for diffusion, we measured the diffusion coefficient
of water in each membrane. We found that the diffusion coefficient of water
inside the GO membrane decreased as the distance between sheets (d) decreased.
The measured diffusion coefficients (in unit of 0.00001 (cm*cm)/sec) of water
are 0.03 (d = 0.7 nm), 0.91 (d = 0.9 nm), 1.18 (d = 1.1 nm), and 1.49 (d = 1.3
nm), whereas it is 2.49 for bulk water. Second, for analyzing the desalination
performance of each membrane, we also calculated the free energy profile of
penetration of water, sodium, and chloride ions via the interlayer of the
membrane. The free energy profile of penetration revealed that the optimum
interlayer distance between GO sheets for desalination is 0.9 ~ 1.1 nm. With
0.9 and 1.1 nm interlayer distance between GO sheets, the free energy barrier
of membrane penetration of water is negligible, where it is 2 ~ 4 kcal/mol for
sodium or chloride ions. We believe that our simulation results would be a
significant contribution to designing a new GO-based membrane for desalination.

ability to transmit mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue fever, Zika, and
chikungunya. Field trials and modeling studies have shown that the fraction of
infection among the mosquitoes must exceed a threshold level for the infection
to persist. To capture this threshold, it is critical to consider the spatial
heterogeneity in the distributions of the infected and uninfected mosquitoes,
which is created by the local release of the infected mosquitoes. We develop
and analyze partial differential equation (PDE) models to study the invasion
dynamics of Wolbachia infection among mosquitoes in the field. Our
reaction-diffusion-type models account for both the complex vertical
transmission and the spatial mosquito dispersion. We characterize the threshold
for a successful invasion, which is a bubble-shaped profile, called the
""critical bubble"". The critical bubble is optimal in its release size compared
to other spatial profiles in a one-dimensional landscape. The fraction of
infection near the release center is higher than the threshold level for the
corresponding homogeneously mixing ODE models. We show that the proposed
spatial models give rise to the traveling waves of Wolbachia infection when
above the threshold. We quantify how the threshold condition and traveling-wave
velocity depend on the diffusion coefficients and other model parameters.
Numerical studies for different scenarios are presented to inform the design of
release strategies.

that of light's in vacuum, and this constraint basically specifies the way that
the scalar potential and the non-minimal couplings of the theory can be chosen.
The whole theoretical framework, which belongs to the larger class of Horndeski
theories, cannot yield viable results, due to the fact that the primordial
gravitational wave speed is not equal to that of light's. Thus we study this

the PES is represented by a deep neural network (DNN) trained on DFT data,
whereby the PES has an explicit local decomposition and the energy flux takes a
particularly simple expression. By virtue of a gauge invariance principle,
established by Marcolongo, Umari, and Baroni, the two approaches should be
equivalent if the PES were reproduced accurately by the DNN model. We test this
hypothesis by calculating the thermal conductivity, at the GGA (PBE) level of
theory, using the direct formulation and its DNN proxy, finding that both
approaches yield the same conductivity, in excess of the experimental value by
approximately 60%. Besides being numerically much more efficient than its
direct DFT counterpart, the DNN scheme has the advantage of being easily
applicable to more sophisticated DFT approximations, such as meta-GGA and
hybrid functionals, for which it would be hard to derive analytically the
expression of the energy flux. We find in this way, that a DNN model, trained
on meta-GGA (SCAN) data, reduce the deviation from experiment of the predicted
thermal conductivity by about 50%, leaving the question open as to whether the
residual error is due to deficiencies of the functional, to a neglect of
nuclear quantum effects in the atomic dynamics, or, likely, to a combination of

series for Schwinger functions as well as the self-energy function have
non-zero radius of convergence when the temperature $T$ is above an
exponentially small value, namely ${T_0\sim \exp{(-C|\lambda|^{-1/2})}}$. Then
we prove the necessary lower bound for second derivatives of self-energy w.r.t.
the external momentum and achieve the proof.

target samples of the same class nearby, forming dense neighborhoods in feature

relevant models and in particular many models focusing on the Darwinian

associated differential operator and establishing a minimal speed formula for
linear monotone systems. In particular, we show that the generalized Dirichlet
principal eigenvalue and the periodic principal eigenvalue may not coincide
when the reaction matrix is not symmetric, in sharp contrast with the case of

holds for the two notions. We also show that the propagation speed may be
different depending on the direction of propagation, even in the absence of a
first-order advection term, again in a sharp contrast with scalar equations.

propagation and the sign of the periodic principal eigenvalue. Finally, we
discuss the linear determinacy of the propagation speed and also establish the

numerically the propagation of a toy GW signal. We then proceed to use the
analytical results to study the modified propagation of realistic GWs from
merging compact binaries, assuming that the GW signal emitted is the same as in
GR. We generically find that tensor interactions lead to copies of the
originally emitted GW signal, each one with its own possibly modified
dispersion relation. These copies can travel coherently and interfere with each
other leading to a scrambled GW signal, or propagate decoherently and lead to
echoes arriving at different times at the observer that could be misidentified

find that at constant metallicity these stars are similar to Milky Way stars in
their $\alpha$, light, and iron-peak elemental abundances, both the LMC and SMC
are enhanced relative to the Milky Way in the $r$-process element europium.
These abundance offsets are highly significant, equivalent to $3.9\sigma$ for
the LMC, $2.7\sigma$ for the SMC, and $5.0\sigma$ for the complete Magellanic

frequency of the rotating field, the dynamics of a ferrimagnetic domain wall
can be classified into two regimes. First, when the frequency is lower than a
certain critical frequency set by the field magnitude, there is a stationary
solution for the domain-wall dynamics, where a domain-wall in-plane
magnetization rotates in-phase with the external field. The field-induced
precession of the domain wall gives rise to the translational motion of the
domain wall via the gyrotropic coupling between the domain-wall angle and
position. In this so-called phase-locking regime, a domain-wall velocity
increases as the frequency increases. Second, when the frequency exceeds the
critical frequency, a domain-wall angle precession is not synchronous with the
applied field. In this phase-unlocking regime, a domain wall velocity decreases
as the frequency increases. Moreover, the direction of the domain-wall motion
is found to be reversed across the angular compensation point where the net
spin density of the ferrimagnet changes its sign. Our work suggests that the
dynamics of magnetic solitons under time-varying biases may serve as platform
to study critical phenomena.

common envelope, the mass and angular momentum loss during binary interactions,
mixing in stellar interiors, pair-instability mass loss and supernova
outbursts. Using standard tools such as the population synthesis codes
StarTrack and COMPAS and the detailed stellar evolution code MESA, we examine
as a case study the possible future evolution of Melnick 34, the most massive
known binary star system. We show that, despite its well-known orbital
architecture, various assumptions regarding stellar and binary physics predict
a wide variety of outcomes: from a close BH-BH binary (which would lead to a
potentially detectable coalescence), through a wide BH-BH binary (which might
be seen in microlensing observations), or a Thorne-Zytkow object, to a complete
disruption of both objects by pair-instability supernovae. Thus since the

of subhalos at small masses can give us insight into the nature of dark matter.
If these subhalos exist in the Milky Way, they would produce weak lensing
signatures, such as modified apparent positions, on background stars. These
signatures would generate correlations in the apparent velocities and
accelerations of these stars, which could be observable given sufficient
astrometric resolution and cadence. The Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope's

possible jet velocity--viewing angle variations at parsec scales. We used the

radio observations in the 100-340~GHz range from ALMA, CARMA, and SMA. For each
frequency we estimate the Doppler factor which we use to quantify possible
changes in the relativistic effects along the jets. The majority of our sources
do not show any statistically significant difference in their Doppler factor
across frequencies. This is consistent with constant velocity in a conical jet,
as expected at parsec scales. However, our analysis reveals 17 sources where
relativistic beaming changes as a function of frequency. In the majority of

numerical simulation (DNS) of a turbulent channel flow at Re$_\tau$=180 using
two different forcing strategies that are designed to separately assess the
anisotropy and nonlocality of momentum mixing. In the first strategy, the
leading term of the Kramers-Moyal expansion of the eddy viscosity operator is
quantified where the macroscopic forcing is employed to reveal all 81 tensorial
coefficients that essentially represent the local-limit eddy viscosity. The
results indicate: (1) eddy viscosity has significant anisotropy, (2) Reynolds
stresses are generated by both mean strain rate and mean rotation rate tensors,
and (3) the local-limit eddy viscosity generates asymmetric Reynolds stress
tensors. In the second strategy, the eddy viscosity operator is considered as
an integration kernel representing the nonlocal influence of mean gradients on
the Reynolds stresses. Considering the average of this kernel in the
homogeneous directions, the macroscopic forcing is designed to reveal the
nonlocal effects in the wall-normal direction for all 9 components of the
Reynolds stresses. Our results indicate that while the shear component of the
Reynolds stress is reasonably controlled by the local mean gradients, other
components of the Reynolds stress are highly nonlocal. These two analyses

the importance of the viewing angle in classifying different types of Seyfert
galaxies in spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling. We retrieve
photometric data from publicly available astronomical databases: CDS and NED,
to model SEDs with X-CIGALE in a sample of 13 173 Seyfert galaxies located at
redshift range from $z=0$ to $z=3.5$, with a median redshift of $z\approx0.2$.
We assess whether the estimated viewing angle from the SED models reflects
different Seyfert classifications. Two AGN models with either a smooth or
clumpy torus structure are adopted in this paper. We find that the viewing
angle in Type-1 AGNs is better constrained than in Type-2 AGNs. Limiting the
viewing angles representing these two types of AGNs do not affect the physical
parameter estimates such as star-formation rate (SFR) or AGN fractional
contribution ($f_{\rm{AGN}}$). In addition, the viewing angle is not the most
discriminating physical parameter to differentiate Seyfert types. We suggest
that the observed and intrinsic AGN disc luminosity can: i) be used in $z<0.5$

probable evolutionary path between these AGN types. Finally, we propose the use

the interacting Green function $G(\mathbf{k};z)$. Utilising a link between the
latter series expansion and the classical moment problem (of the Hamburger

earlier observation (2007) that for lattice models of fermions interacting
through short-range two-body potentials (i.e. for Hubbard-like models) this

complex energies $z$. The limit of this series is unique. We inquire into the
reasons underlying the contrary observation by Kozik et al. (2015) regarding

we make a number of observations of general interest. Chief amongst these, we
observe that contrary to general belief thermal correlation functions

between two power laws. As a result, it enables fluid to have a smooth
transition from dust at early times to dark energy at late times. The
dissipation is represented by a bulk viscosity with a constant coefficient,
whereas shear viscosity is excluded due to the isotropy of the universe. We
performed a likelihood analysis using recent observational datasets from local
$H_0$ measurements, SNe Ia, observational Hubble data, BAO, and CMB to put
cosmological constraints on the model. The special case of the non-dissipative
unified dark fluid (UDF) is also studied, while a similar analysis is performed
on the $\Lambda$CDM model for comparison. We got an $H_0$ value of $70.02$ $km$
$s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$ for DUDF and $70.25$ $km$ $s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}$ for the UDF

one due to the observational data used. Our results revealed that the UDF model
has the minimum AIC, with the conclusion that it is the most favorable model
for the data. $\Delta AIC$ value of other models are then measured to this
model. This difference indicated that the DUDF model is a substantial model on
the level of empirical support. Examining the evolution of the deceleration
parameter, the effective equation of state parameter, and the density parameter
indicated that our unified fluid doesn't deviate from the standard $\Lambda$CDM
model at early times, with the ability to play the role of the cosmological

measurements to better constrain the atmospheric properties and the planet
radius ($R_p$). We simulate spectra (500-900 nm) at $\alpha$=37$^\circ$,
85$^\circ$ and 123$^\circ$ with spectral resolution $R$~125-225 and
signal-to-noise ratio $S/N$=10. Assuming a H$_2$-He atmosphere, we use a
seven-parameter model that includes the atmospheric methane abundance
($f_{CH_4}$), the optical properties of a cloud layer and $R_p$. All these
parameters are assumed unknown a priori and explored with an MCMC retrieval
method. We find that no single-phase observation can robustly identify whether
the atmosphere has clouds or not. A single-phase observation at
$\alpha$=123$^\circ$ and $S/N$=10 can constrain $R_p$ with a maximum error of
35%, regardless of the cloud coverage. Combining small (37$^\circ$) and large
(123$^\circ$) phase angles is a generally effective strategy to break multiple
parameter degeneracies. This enables to determine the presence or absence of a
cloud and its main properties, $f_{CH_4}$ and $R_p$ in all the explored
scenarios. Other strategies, such as doubling $S/N$ to 20 for a single-phase
observation or combining small (37$^\circ$) and moderate (85$^\circ$) phase
angles, fail to achieve this. We show that the improvements in multi-phase
retrievals are associated with the shape of the scattering phase function of
the cloud aerosols and that the improvement is more modest for
isotropically-scattering aerosols. We finally discuss that misidentifying the
background gas in the retrievals of super-Earth observations leads to a
systematic underestimate of the absorbing gas abundance.

radiation ($\sim 3 \times10^{10}$cm), and the magnetic field strength there
($\sim$10$^4$G), with relatively low uncertainty, as they depend weakly on the
bulk Lorentz factor. We find the breaks in the variability power spectra from

equal to the travel time along the jet at any Lorentz factor. This factor can
still be constrained by the electron-positron pair production rate within the

propagation in mate-rials over the past several decades, but they suffer from
limitations which restrict the total runtime and system size. Multiscale
methods have been able to increase the length and time scales that can be
modeled but employing such schemes to simulate wave propagation and evolution
through engineering-scale domains is an active area of research. In this work,
we develop two distinct moving window approaches within a Concurrent
Atomistic-Continuum (CAC) framework to model shock wave propagation through a
one-dimensional monatomic chain. In the first method, the entire CAC system
travels with the shock in a conveyor fashion and maintains the shock front in
the middle of the overall domain. In the second method, the atomistic region
follows the shock by the simultaneous coarsening and refinement of the
continuum regions. The CAC and moving window frameworks are verified through
dispersion relation studies and phonon wave packet tests. We achieve good
agreement between the simulated shock velocities and the values obtained from
theory with the conveyor technique, while the coarsen-refine technique allows
us to follow the propagating wave front through a large-scale domain. This work
showcases the ability of the CAC method to accurately simulate propagating
shocks and also demonstrates how a moving window technique can be used in a
multiscale framework to study highly nonlinear, transient phenomena.

estimation, and can be expected to increase at 7T where $B_1$ fields are more
inhomogeneous. The established correction scheme does not translate to 7T since
it requires a body coil reference. Here we introduce two alternatives that
outperform the established method. Since they compute relative sensitivities
they do not require body coil images.
  Theory: The proposed methods use coil-combined magnitude images to obtain the
relative coil sensitivities. The first method efficiently computes the relative
sensitivities via a simple ratio; the second by fitting a more sophisticated
generative model.
  Methods: $R_1$ maps were computed using the variable flip angle (VFA)
approach. Multiple datasets were acquired at 3T and 7T, with and without motion
between the acquisition of the VFA volumes. $R_1$ maps were constructed without
correction, with the proposed corrections, and (at 3T) with the previously
established correction scheme.
  Results: At 3T, the proposed methods outperform the baseline method.
Inter-scan motion artefacts were also reduced at 7T. However, reproducibility
only converged on that of the no motion condition if position-specific transmit
field effects were also incorporated.
  Conclusion: The proposed methods simplify inter-scan motion correction of
$R_1$ maps and are applicable at both 3T and 7T, where a body coil is typically
not available. The open-source code for all methods is made publicly available.

several factors, including driving behavior and driving environment, affecting
the perception of comfort. Automatically extracting the perceived comfort level
of a commuter due to the impact of the driving behavior is crucial for a timely
feedback to the drivers, which can help them to meet the commuter's
satisfaction. In light of this, we surveyed around 200 commuters who usually
take such cab rides and obtained a set of features that impact comfort during
cab rides. Following this, we develop a system Ridergo which collects
smartphone sensor data from a commuter, extracts the spatial time series
feature from the data, and then computes the level of commuter comfort on a
five-point scale with respect to the driving. Ridergo uses a Hierarchical

to obtain the comfort level of the commuter at a personalized level. The model
also intelligently queries the commuter to add new data points to the available

oscillatory flows as an alternative for steady currents within the

photothermal response and heat dissipation of nanoscopic systems, which remains
a challenging task both for modeling and experimental measurements. Here, we
present a new implementation of anti-Stokes thermometry that enables the in
situ photothermal characterization of individual nanoparticles (NPs) from a
single hyperspectral photoluminescence confocal image. The method is
label-free, applicable to any NP with detectable anti-Stokes emission, and does
not require any prior information about the NP itself or the surrounding media.
With it, we first studied the photothermal response of spherical gold NPs of
different sizes on glass substrates, immersed in water, and found that heat
dissipation is mainly dominated by the water for NPs larger than 50 nm. Then,
the role of the substrate was studied by comparing the photothermal response of
80 nm gold NPs on glass with sapphire and graphene, two materials with high
thermal conductivity. For a given irradiance level, the NPs reach temperatures
18% lower on sapphire and 24% higher on graphene than on bare glass. The fact
that the presence of a highly conductive material such as graphene leads to a
poorer thermal dissipation demonstrates that interfacial thermal resistances
play a very significant role in nanoscopic systems, and emphasize the need for
in situ experimental thermometry techniques. The developed method will allow
addressing several open questions about the role of temperature in
plasmon-assisted applications, especially ones where NPs of arbitrary shapes

case with the cosmological constant, which generalizes our previous dust
solution (arXiv:2008.06560) and led to vacuum solutions connecting the warp
drive with shock waves via the Burgers equation, as well as our perfect fluid
solution without the cosmological constant (arXiv:2101.11467). All energy

direction of the warp bubble motion creates a coupling in the Einstein
equations that requires off-diagonal terms in the energy-momentum source.
Therefore, it seems that to achieve superluminal speeds by means of the
Alcubierre warp drive spacetime geometry one may require a complex
configuration and distribution of energy, matter and momentum as source in
order to produce a warp drive bubble. In addition, warp speeds seem to require
more complex forms of matter than dust for stable solutions and that negative
matter may not be a strict requirement to achieve global superluminal speeds.

Although promising, existing gate-based quantum computers consist of only a few
dozen qubits and are not large enough for most applications. On the other hand,
existing QAs with few thousand of qubits have the potential to solve some
domain-specific optimization problems. QAs are single instruction machines and
to execute a program, the problem is cast to a Hamiltonian, embedded on the
hardware, and a single quantum machine instruction (QMI) is run. Unfortunately,
noise and imperfections in hardware result in sub-optimal solutions on QAs even
if the QMI is run for thousands of trials.
  The limited programmability of QAs mean that the user executes the same QMI
for all trials. This subjects all trials to a similar noise profile throughout
the execution, resulting in a systematic bias. We observe that systematic bias
leads to sub-optimal solutions and cannot be alleviated by executing more
trials or using existing error-mitigation schemes. To address this challenge,
we propose EQUAL (Ensemble Quantum Annealing). EQUAL generates an ensemble of
QMIs by adding controlled perturbations to the program QMI. When executed on
the QA, the ensemble of QMIs steers the program away from encountering the same
bias during all trials and thus, improves the quality of solutions. Our
evaluations using the 2041-qubit D-Wave QA show that EQUAL bridges the
difference between the baseline and the ideal by an average of 14% (and up to

shape anisotropy, the reversal time significantly reduces. These findings are
related to the competition of shape anisotropy and uniaxial magnetocrystalline
anisotropy and thus to the height of energy barrier which separates the two
stable states. The result of damping dependence of magnetization reversal
indicates that for a certain sample shape, there exists an optimal damping
situation at which magnetization is fastest. Moreover, it is also shown that
the required microwave field amplitude can be lowered by applying the
spin-polarized current simultaneously. The usage of an optimum combination of
both microwave field pulse and current is suggested to achieve cost efficiency

the tearing instability in the flare current sheet. Here we study this
connection by constructing an analytical three-dimensional magnetic field
representative of an erupting flux rope with a flare current sheet below it. We
introduce small-scale flux ropes representative of those formed during a
tearing instability in the current layer, and use the squashing factor on the
solar surface to identify the shape of the presumed flare ribbons and fine
structure. Our analysis suggests there is a direct link between flare-ribbon
fine structure and flare current sheet tearing, with the majority of the ribbon
fine structure related to oblique tearing modes. Depending upon the size,
location and twist of the small-scale flux ropes, breaking wave-like and spiral
features within the hooks and straight sections of the flare ribbon can be
formed that are qualitatively similar to observations. We also show that the
handedness of the spirals/waves must be the same as the handedness of the hooks
of the main ribbon. We conclude that tearing in the flare current layer is a
likely explanation for spirals and wave-like features in flare ribbons.

the Indian Sign Language (ISL) in real-time using grid-based features. This
system attempts to bridge the communication gap between the hearing and speech
impaired and the rest of the society. The existing solutions either provide
relatively low accuracy or do not work in real-time. This system provides good
results on both the parameters. It can identify 33 hand poses and some gestures
from the ISL. Sign Language is captured from a smartphone camera and its frames
are transmitted to a remote server for processing. The use of any external
hardware (such as gloves or the Microsoft Kinect sensor) is avoided, making it
user-friendly. Techniques such as Face detection, Object stabilisation and Skin
Colour Segmentation are used for hand detection and tracking. The image is
further subjected to a Grid-based Feature Extraction technique which represents
the hand's pose in the form of a Feature Vector. Hand poses are then classified
using the k-Nearest Neighbours algorithm. On the other hand, for gesture
classification, the motion and intermediate hand poses observation sequences
are fed to Hidden Markov Model chains corresponding to the 12 pre-selected
gestures defined in ISL. Using this methodology, the system is able to achieve
an accuracy of 99.7% for static hand poses, and an accuracy of 97.23% for
gesture recognition.

improvements over classical methods. However, supervised learning based methods
perform poorly when the training data and the test data have different

synthetic ShapeNet dataset, but dramatically fail in when presented with real
world images. To address this issue, unsupervised domain adaptation can be used
transfer knowledge from the labeled synthetic source domain and learn a
classifier for the unlabeled real target domain. To tackle this challenge of
single view 3D reconstruction in the real domain, we experiment with a variety
of domain adaptation techniques inspired by the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD)
loss, Deep CORAL, and the domain adversarial neural network (DANN). From these
findings, we additionally propose a novel architecture which takes advantage of
the fact that in this setting, target domain data is unsupervised with regards

room temperature in several Pt/Co-based thin film heterostructures designed to
possess a low exchange stiffness, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, and a
modest interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI). We find both
experimentally and by micromagnetic and analytic modeling that the combined
action of low exchange stiffness and modest iDMI eliminates the energetic
penalty associated with forming domain walls in thin film heterostructures.
When the domain wall energy density approaches negative values, the remanent
domain morphology transitions from a uniform state to a labyrinthian stripe
phase. A low exchange stiffness, indicated by a reduction in the Curie
temperature below 400 K, is achieved in Pt/Co, Pt/Co/Ni, and Pt/Co/Ni/Re
structures by reducing the Co thickness to the ultrathin limit (< 0.3 nm). A
similar effect occurs in thicker Pt/Co/NixCu1-x structures when the Ni layer is
alloyed with Cu. At this transition in domain morphology, skyrmion phases are
stabilized when a small (< 1 mT) perpendicular magnetic field is applied and
current-induced skyrmion motion including the skyrmion Hall effect is observed.
The temperature and thickness-induced morphological phase transitions observed
are similar to the well-studied spin reorientation transition that occurs in
the ultrathin limit, but we find that the underlying energy balances are
substantially modified by the presence of an iDMI.

energies and the mode profiles are computed in closed form, for different
fractional exponents and different impurity strengths. The energies of the
impurity mode lie outside the linear band whose bandwidth decreases steadily as
the fractional exponent decreases. For any fractional exponent values, there is
always a single bound state for the linear impurity while for the nonlinear
(Kerr) case, up to two bound states are possible, for impurity strengths above
certain threshold. The energy of the linear mode (or that of the upper energy
nonlinear one), becomes directly proportional to the impurity strength at large
impurity strengths. The transmission of plane waves is also computed in closed
form for several fractional exponents, and various impurity strengths. We
observe that fractionality tends to increase the overall transmission. The
selftrapping transition for the nonlinear impurity shifts to lower nonlinearity
values as the fractional exponent is decreased. In both cases, linear and

systems through lifting linearization underpinned by Koopman operator and
physical system modeling theory are presented. Outputs of a nonlinear control
system, called observables, may be functions of state and input, $\phi(x,u)$.
These input-dependent observables cannot be used for lifting the system because
the state equations in the augmented space contain the time derivatives of
input and are therefore anticausal. Here, the mechanism of creating anticausal
observables is examined, and two methods for solving the causality problem in
lifting linearization are presented. The first method is to replace anticausal
observables by their integral variables $\phi^*$, and lift the dynamics with
$\phi^*$, so that the time derivative of $\phi^*$ does not include the time
derivative of input. The other method is to alter the original physical model
by adding a small inertial element, or a small capacitive element, so that the
system's causal relationship changes. These augmented dynamics alter the signal
path from the input to the anticausal observable so that the observables are
not dependent on inputs. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of
the methods.

study the cell cycle and cell biology: One class of experiments characterizes
the statistics (or demographics) of an unsynchronized exponentially-growing
population, while the other captures cell cycle dynamics, either by time-lapse
imaging of full cell cycles or in bulk experiments on synchronized populations.
In this paper, we study the subtle relationship between observations in these
two distinct experimental approaches. We begin with an existing model: a
single-cell deterministic description of cell cycle dynamics where cell states
(i.e. periods or phases) have precise lifetimes. We then generalize this
description to a stochastic model in which the states have stochastic
lifetimes, as described by arbitrary probability distribution functions. Our
analyses of the demographics of an exponential culture reveal a simple and
exact correspondence between the deterministic and stochastic models: The
corresponding state lifetimes in the deterministic model are equal to the
exponential mean of the lifetimes in the stochastic model. An important
implication is therefore that the demographics of an exponential culture will
be well-fit by a deterministic model even if the state timing is stochastic.
Although we explore the implications of the models in the context of the
Escherichia coli cell cycle, we expect both the models as well as the
significance of the exponential-mean lifetimes to find many applications in the
quantitative analysis of cell cycle dynamics in other biological systems.

distinguish cyber-attacks from regular system perturbations accurately. First,
our proposed approach builds a dictionary by learning higher-level features
from unlabeled data. Then, the labeled data are represented as sparse linear
combinations of learned dictionary atoms. We capitalize on those sparse codes
to train the online classifier along with efficient change detectors. We
conduct numerical experiments with industrial control systems cyber-attack

maintenance, remote tripping command injection, relay setting change, as well
as false data injection. The data are generated based on a modified IEEE 9-bus

that the augmentation of in the wild datasets, such as ImageNet, with in the

object recognizers of improved generalization. Third, the dataset is used to
study questions on ""best procedures"" for dataset collection. It is revealed
that data augmentation with synthetic images does not suffice to eliminate in

Review (MCR), in which reviewers can contribute code improvements, such as
refactorings, through comments and commits in Pull Requests (PRs). Past MCR
studies uniformly treat all PRs, regardless of whether they induce refactoring
or not. We define a PR as refactoring-inducing, when refactoring edits are
performed after the initial commit(s), as either a result of discussion among
reviewers or spontaneous actions carried out by the PR developer. Aims: This
mixed study (quantitative and qualitative) explores code reviewing-related
aspects intending to characterize refactoring-inducing PRs. Method: We
hypothesize that refactoring-inducing PRs have distinct characteristics than
non-refactoring-inducing ones and thus deserve special attention and treatment
from researchers, practitioners, and tool builders. To investigate our
hypothesis, we mined a sample of 1,845 Apache's merged PRs from GitHub, mined
refactoring edits in these PRs, and ran a comparative study between
refactoring-inducing and non-refactoring-inducing PRs. We also manually
examined 2,096 review comments and 1,891 detected refactorings from 228
refactoring-inducing PRs. Results: We found 30.2% of refactoring-inducing PRs
in our sample and that they significantly differ from non-refactoring-inducing
ones in terms of number of commits, code churn, number of file changes, number
of review comments, length of discussion, and time to merge. However, we found
no statistical evidence that the number of reviewers is related to
refactoring-inducement. Our qualitative analysis revealed that at least one

to tune the interlayer interactions. In this work, we demonstrate how the van
der Waals interlayer coupling and charge transfer of Janus MoSSe/MoS2
heterobilayers can be tuned by the twist angle and interface composition.
Specifically, the Janus heterostructures with a sulfur/sulfur (S/S) interface
display stronger interlayer coupling than the heterostructures with a
selenium/sulfur (Se/S) interface as shown by the low-frequency Raman modes. The
differences in interlayer interactions are explained by the interlayer distance
computed by density-functional theory (DFT). More intriguingly, the built-in
electric field contributed by the charge density redistribution and interlayer
coupling also play important roles in the interfacial charge transfer. Namely,
the S/S and Se/S interfaces exhibit different levels of PL quenching of MoS2 A
exciton, suggesting the enhanced and reduced charge transfer at the S/S and
Se/S interface, respectively. Our work demonstrates how the asymmetry of Janus
TMDs can be used to tailor the interfacial interactions in van der Waals

regular graphs and scale-free networks. We prove that the model coincides
exactly with the Ising model and shows a phase transition at the critical
selection noise when the aspiration level is zero. It is found that the
critical selection noise decreases with clustering in random regular graphs.
With a non-zero aspiration level, the model also exhibits a phase transition as
long as the aspiration level is smaller than the degree of graphs. We also show
that the critical exponents are independent of clustering and aspiration level
to confirm that the coordination game belongs to the Ising universality class.
As for scale-free networks, the effect of aspiration level on the order
parameter at a low selection noise is examined. In model networks
(Barab\'{a}si-Albert network and Holme-Kim network), the order parameter
abruptly decreases when the aspiration level is the same as the average degree
of the network. In real-world networks, in contrast, the order parameter
decreases gradually. We explain this difference by proposing the concepts of
hub centrality and local hub. The histogram of hub centrality of real-world
networks separates into two parts unlike model networks, and local hubs exist
only in real-world networks. We conclude that the difference of network
structures in model and real-world networks induces qualitatively different
behavior in the coordination game.

constrain the free parameters of both models. From a joint analysis, we obtain
constraints that are consistent with the standard cosmological paradigm within

building in large-scale studies. Although several works have studied
theoretical and numerical properties of sparse neural architectures, they have
primarily focused on the edge selection. Sparsity through edge selection might
be intuitively appealing; however, it does not necessarily reduce the
structural complexity of a network. Instead pruning excessive nodes leads to a
structurally sparse network with significant computational speedup during
inference. To this end, we propose a Bayesian sparse solution using
spike-and-slab Gaussian priors to allow for automatic node selection during
training. The use of spike-and-slab prior alleviates the need of an ad-hoc
thresholding rule for pruning. In addition, we adopt a variational Bayes
approach to circumvent the computational challenges of traditional Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) implementation. In the context of node selection, we
establish the fundamental result of variational posterior consistency together
with the characterization of prior parameters. In contrast to the previous
works, our theoretical development relaxes the assumptions of the equal number
of nodes and uniform bounds on all network weights, thereby accommodating
sparse networks with layer-dependent node structures or coefficient bounds.
With a layer-wise characterization of prior inclusion probabilities, we discuss
the optimal contraction rates of the variational posterior. We empirically
demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the edge selection method in
computational complexity with similar or better predictive performance. Our
experimental evidence further substantiates that our theoretical work
facilitates layer-wise optimal node recovery.

atomic diffusion might influence the observed abundance patterns. We conduct a
strictly line-by-line differential chemical abundance analysis of 7 binary
systems. Stellar atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances are obtained
with extremely high precision (< 3.5%) using the high quality spectra from
VLT/UVES and Keck/HIRES. We find that 4 of 7 binary systems show subtle
abundance differences (0.01 - 0.03 dex) without clear correlations with the
condensation temperature, including two planet-hosting pairs. The other 3
binary systems exhibit similar degree of abundance differences correlating with
the condensation temperature. We do not find any clear relation between the
abundance differences and the occurrence of known planets in our systems.
Instead, the overall abundance offsets observed in the binary systems (4 of 7)
could be due to the effects of atomic diffusion. Although giant planet
formation does not necessarily imprint chemical signatures onto the host star,
the differences in the observed abundance trends with condensation temperature,
on the other hand, are likely associated with diverse histories of planet
formation (e.g., formation location). Furthermore, we find a weak correlation

Measuring the quality factor of the graphene resonator provides a way to
evaluate the energy dissipation. The graphene ribbon is integrated with silicon
micro actuators, allowing its in-plane tension to be finely tuned. As we
gradually increased the tension, we observed, in addition to the well-known
resonance frequency increase, a large change in the energy dissipation. We
propose that the dominating energy dissipation mechanism shifts over three
regions. With small applied tension, the graphene is in elastic region, and the
major energy dissipation is through graphene edge folding; as the tension
increases, dislocations start to develop in the sample to gradually dominate
the energy dissipation; finally, at large enough tension, graphene layers
become decoupled and start to slide and cause friction, which induces the more
severe energy dissipation. The generation and modulation of dislocations are
modeled by molecular dynamics calculation and a method to count the energy loss
is proposed and compared to the experiment.

In particular, we emphasize the importance of performing both of the extinction

between critical parameters in these analyses, which can be resolved by
iteratively seeking a converged solution. The use of PPAP allows us to
eliminate unnecessary assumptions that prevent us from obtaining an exact
solution at each element of the spectral imaging data. Using a suite of
HST/WFC3 narrowband images of the planetary nebula, NGC 6720, we validate PPAP
by (1) simultaneously and self-consistently deriving the extinction, c(Hb), and
electron density/temperature distribution, (n_e, T_e), maps that are consistent
with each other, and (2) obtaining identical metal abundance distribution maps,
(n(N^+)/n(H^+), n(S^+)/n(H^+)), from multiple emission line maps at different

is capable of identifying the upcoming change in the UAV lineup (quit or
join-in) or user distribution, and proactively relocating the UAVs ahead of the
change rather than passively dispatching the UAVs after the change.
Specifically, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based UAV control framework
is developed to maximize the accumulated user satisfaction (US) score for a
given time horizon which is able to handle the change in both the UAV lineup
and user distribution. The framework accommodates the changed dimension of the
state-action space before and after the UAV lineup change by deliberate state
transition design. In addition, to handle the continuous state and action
space, deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, which is an
actor-critic based DRL, is exploited. Furthermore, to promote the learning
exploration around the timing of the change, the original DDPG is adapted into
an asynchronous parallel computing (APC) structure which leads to a better
training performance in both the critic and actor networks. Finally, extensive
simulations are conducted to validate the convergence of the proposed learning
approach, and demonstrate its capability in jointly handling the dynamics in

In the discretization phase, the continuous architecture is approximated based

that the ground-truth labels are automatically available, enabling unlimited

there is no one-to-one correspondence between box-wise anchors and pixel-level

customized object feature learning in each layer. By integrating the SCWS
blocks into the single-shot detector, a scale-aware object detector (SCOD) is
constructed to detect objects of different sizes naturally and accurately.
Furthermore, the standard location loss neglects the fact that the hard and
easy samples may be seriously imbalanced. A forthcoming problem is that it is
unable to get more accurate bounding boxes due to the imbalance. To address
this problem, an adaptive IoU (AIoU) loss via a simple yet effective squeeze

unavoidably results in feature smoothing between neighborhoods in different

towards its training data. In particular, an overfitted image encoder is more
likely to output more (or less) similar feature vectors for two augmented

on image encoders pre-trained on multiple datasets by ourselves as well as the

We find that there is no significant impact made by one-way movement
restrictions over unrestricted movement. Instead, we find that a combination of
lowering the number of individuals admitted below the current recommendations
and advising individuals to reduce the frequency at which they leave their
workstations lowers the likelihood of highly connected individuals within the
contact networks that emerge, which in turn lowers the overall risk of
infection. We discover three classes of possible interventions based on their

secondary attack rates and transmissibility in the SIR model, we compare

particle accelerators rely on computer modeling at some point, sometimes
requiring complex simulation tools and massively parallel supercomputing.
Examples include the modeling of beams at extreme intensities and densities

level of individual particles). In the future, adaptively tuned models might
also be relied upon to provide beam measurements beyond the resolution of

positives, the most common of background eclipsing binaries (BEBs) and
companion transiting planets (CTPs). Multi-color photometry can reveal the
color-dependent depth feature of false positives and thus exclude them. In this
work, we aim to estimate the fraction of false positives that are unable to be
classified by Kepler alone but can be identified with their color-dependent
depth feature if a reference band (z, Ks and TESS) were adopted in follow-up
observation. We build up physics-based blend models to simulate multi-band
signals of false positives. Nearly 65-95% of the BEBs and more than 80% of the
CTPs that host a Jupiter-size planet will show detectable depth variations if
the reference band can achieve a Kepler-like precision. Ks band is most
effective in eliminating BEBs exhibiting any depth sizes, while z and TESS band
prefer to identify giant candidates and their identification rates are more
sensitive to photometric precision. Provided the radius distribution of planets
transiting the secondary star in binary systems, we derive formalism to
calculate the overall identification rate for CTPs. By comparing the likelihood
distribution of the double-band depth ratio for BEB and planet models, we
calculate the false positive probability (FPP) for typical Kepler candidates.
Additionally, we show that the FPP calculation helps distinguish the planet
candidate's host star in an unresolved binary system. The analysis framework of
this paper can be easily adapted to predict the multi-color photometry yield
for other transit surveys, especially for TESS.

assigned to each code element based on test coverage and test outcomes. The
scores are then used to rank the code elements relative to each other in order
to aid the programmer during the debugging process when seeking the source of a
fault. However, probably none of the known SBFL formulae are guaranteed to
produce different scores for all the program elements, hence ties emerge
between the code elements. Based on our experiments, ties in SBFL are
prevalent: in Defects4J, 54-56% of buggy methods are members of ties, i.e.,
there is at least one other method with the same score in these cases (but
typically much more, on average 6), and this inevitably reduces the
effectiveness of any SBFL approach. In this work, we present a technique to
break ties in such cases based on the so-called method calls frequencies. This
counts the number of different contexts of method calls (both as callees and as
callers) in failing test cases. The intuition is that if a method appears in
many different calling contexts during a failing test case, it will be more
suspicious and get a higher rank position compared to other methods with the
same scores. This method can be applied to any underlying SBFL formula, and can
favourably break the occurring ranks in the ties in many cases. The
experimental results show that our novel tie-breaking strategy achieved a
significant reduction in both size and number of critical ties in our
benchmark. In 72-73% of the cases, the ties were completely eliminated and the
average reduction rate was more than 80%.

address this gap by investigating methods for integrating PRF signals into
rerankers and dense retrievers based on deep language models. We consider
text-based and vector-based PRF approaches, and investigate different ways of
combining and scoring relevance signals. An extensive empirical evaluation was
conducted across four different datasets and two task settings (retrieval and
ranking). Text-based PRF results show that the use of PRF had a mixed effect on
deep rerankers across different datasets. We found that the best effectiveness
was achieved when (i) directly concatenating each PRF passage with the query,
searching with the new set of queries, and then aggregating the scores; (ii)
using Borda to aggregate scores from PRF runs. Vector-based PRF results show
that the use of PRF enhanced the effectiveness of deep rerankers and dense
retrievers over several evaluation metrics. We found that higher effectiveness
was achieved when (i) the query retains either the majority or the same weight
within the PRF mechanism, and (ii) a shallower PRF signal (i.e., a smaller
number of top-ranked passages) was employed, rather than a deeper signal. Our
vector-based PRF method is computationally efficient; thus this represents a

Our objective is to conservatively approximate the system's reachable set

is the force applied on the tank and the overall system consists of two

the Control Lyapunov Functional methodology, a set of initial conditions (state
space) is determined for which spill-free motion of the liquid is possible by
applying an appropriate control input. Semi-global stabilization of the liquid
and the tank by means of a simple feedback law is achieved, in the sense that
for every closed subset of the state space, it is possible to find appropriate
controller gains, so that every solution of the closed-loop system initiated
from the given closed subset satisfies specific stability estimates. The
closed-loop system exhibits an exponential convergence rate to the desired
equilibrium point. The proposed stabilizing feedback law does not require
measurement of the liquid level and velocity profiles inside the tank and
simply requires measurements of: (i) the tank position error and tank velocity,
(ii) the total momentum of the liquid, and (iii) the liquid levels at the tank
walls. The obtained results allow an algorithmic solution of the problem of the

to interpret the activation of any kernel of interest in CNN models. The basic
idea is to simultaneously preserve the activation of the specific kernel and
suppress the activation of all other kernels at the same layer. In this way,
only visual information relevant to the activation of the specific kernel is
remained in the input. Consistent visual information from multiple modified

of a recurrent neural network. Various configurations of the architectures are
trialled. A minimum correlation statistic is used to identify clusters of APSIM
scenarios that can be aggregated to form training sets for model emulation. We
focus on emulating 4 important outputs of the APSIM model: runoff, soil_loss,
DINrunoff, Nleached. The GRU-FFNN architecture with three hidden layers and 128
units per layer provides good emulation of runoff and DINrunoff. However,
soil_loss and Nleached were emulated relatively poorly under a wide range of
the considered architectures; the emulators failed to capture variability at
higher values of these two outputs. While the opportunistic data available from
past modelling activities provides a large and useful dataset for exploring
APSIM emulation, it may not be sufficiently rich enough for successful deep
learning of more complex model dynamics. Design of Computer Experiments may be
required to generate more informative data to emulate all output variables of

space to those on the affine Grassmannian G(d,n). This is said to be X-ray
transform if d=1 and Radon transform if d=n-1. When n=2 the X-ray transform is
thought to be measurements of CT scanners. In this paper we obtain concrete
expression of the canonical relation of the d-plane transform and quantitative
properties of the filtered back-projection of the product of the images of the

processes. Caused by the sophisticated interactions between foulant and
membrane surface, fouling strongly depends on membrane surface chemistry and
morphology. Current studies in the field have been largely focused on polymer
membranes. Herein, we report a molecular simulation study for fouling on
alumina and graphene membrane surfaces during water treatment. For two foulants
(sucralose and bisphenol A), the fouling on alumina surfaces is reduced with
increasing surface roughness; however, the fouling on graphene surfaces is
enhanced by roughness. It is unravelled that the foulant-surface interaction
becomes weaker in the ridge region of a rough alumina surface, thus allowing
foulant to leave the surface and reducing fouling. Such behavior is not
observed on a rough graphene surface because of the strong foulant-graphene
interaction. Moreover, with increasing roughness, the hydrogen bonds formed
between water and alumina surfaces are found to increase in number as well as
stability. By scaling the atomic charges of alumina, fouling behavior on
alumina surfaces is shifted to the one on graphene surfaces. This simulation
study reveals that surface chemistry and roughness play a crucial role in
membrane fouling, and the microscopic insights are useful for the design of new
membranes towards high-performance water treatment.

demonstrated the potential of integrating bioleaching and biosorption as a
clean Cu recovery technology utilizing only sustainable resources (i.e.,
bio-lixiviant and biosorbents). This presents a closed-loop approach to Cu

Early detection of faulty components in machines for stopping and repairing the
failed components can minimize the downtime of the machine. This article
presents an approach to detect the failure occurring in drill machines based on
drill sounds from Valmet AB. The drill dataset includes three classes:
anomalous sounds, normal sounds, and irrelevant sounds, which are also labeled
as ""Broken"", ""Normal"", and ""Other"", respectively. Detecting drill failure
effectively remains a challenge due to the following reasons. The waveform of
drill sound is complex and short for detection. Additionally, in realistic
soundscapes, there are sounds and noise in the context at the same time.
Moreover, the balanced dataset is small to apply state-of-the-art deep learning
techniques. To overcome these aforementioned difficulties, we augmented sounds
to increase the number of sounds in the dataset. We then proposed a
convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with a long short-term memory
(LSTM) to extract features from log-Mel spectrograms and learn global
high-level feature representation for the classification of three classes. A
leaky rectified linear unit (Leaky ReLU) was utilized as the activation
function for our proposed CNN instead of the rectified linear unit (ReLU).
Moreover, we deployed an attention mechanism at the frame level after the LSTM
layer to learn long-term global feature representations. As a result, the
proposed method reached an overall accuracy of 92.35% for the drill failure
detection system.

perform accurate RSSi-based visitor tracking when the density of antennas is
relatively low, e.g. due to technical constraints imposed by historic

through natural language and grasps a specified object in clutter. The objects
may occlude, obstruct, or even stack on top of one another. INVIGORATE embodies
several challenges: (i) infer the target object among other occluding objects,
from input language expressions and RGB images, (ii) infer object blocking
relationships (OBRs) from the images, and (iii) synthesize a multi-step plan to
ask questions that disambiguate the target object and to grasp it successfully.
We train separate neural networks for object detection, for visual grounding,
for question generation, and for OBR detection and grasping. They allow for
unrestricted object categories and language expressions, subject to the
training datasets. However, errors in visual perception and ambiguity in human
languages are inevitable and negatively impact the robot's performance. To
overcome these uncertainties, we build a partially observable Markov decision
process (POMDP) that integrates the learned neural network modules. Through
approximate POMDP planning, the robot tracks the history of observations and
asks disambiguation questions in order to achieve a near-optimal sequence of
actions that identify and grasp the target object. INVIGORATE combines the
benefits of model-based POMDP planning and data-driven deep learning.
Preliminary experiments with INVIGORATE on a Fetch robot show significant
benefits of this integrated approach to object grasping in clutter with natural

deficiency. We performed an asteroseismological analysis of these stars on the
basis of PG~1159 evolutionary models that take into account the complete
evolution of the progenitor stars. We searched for patterns of uniform period
spacings in order to constrain the stellar mass of the stars, and employed the
individual observed periods to search for a representative seismological model.
The analysis of the {\it TESS} light curves of TIC\,333432673 and

ranging from 350 to 500~s associated to typical gravity ($g$)-modes. From

effective temperature ($T_\mathrm{eff} = 120,000 \pm 10,000$\,K) and surface
gravity ($\log g = 7.5 \pm 0.5$) but a different He/C composition. On the basis
of PG~1159 evolutionary tracks, we derived a spectroscopic mass of $M_{\star}$
= $0.58^{+0.16}_{-0.08}\,M_{\odot}$ for both stars. Our asteroseismological
analysis of TIC\,333432673 allowed us to find a constant period spacing
compatible with a stellar mass $M_{\star}\sim 0.60-0.61\,M_{\odot}$, and an
asteroseismological model for this star with a stellar mass $M_{\star}$ =
$0.589\pm 0.020$ $M_{\odot}$, and a seismological distance of $d=
459^{+188}_{-156}$ pc. For this star, we find an excellent agreement between
the different methods to infer the stellar mass, and also between the
seismological distance and that measured with {\it Gaia} ($d_{\rm Gaia}=

severe class imbalance. In addition, the resulting learned representations are
also remarkably robust to label noise, when fine-tuned with an imbalance- and

degradation factor. In particle simulations, this is mainly due to the
migration of particles between processing elements, which eventually gather
unevenly and create workload imbalance. Dynamic load balancing is used at
various iterations to mitigate load imbalance, employing a partitioning method
to divide the computational space evenly while minimizing communications. In
this paper, we propose a novel partitioning methodology called ``informed
partitioning''. It uses information based on the evolution of the computation
to reduce the load balancing growth and the number of load balancing calls. We
illustrate informed partitioning by proposing a new geometric partitioning
technique for particles simulations. This technique is derived from the
well-known recursive coordinate bisection and employs the velocity of the
particles to guide the bisection axis. To properly compare the performance of
our new method with existing partitioning techniques during application
execution, we introduce an effort metric based on a theoretical model of load
balanced parallel application time. We propose a proof-of-concept of informed
partitioning, through a numerical study, on three N-Body simulations with
various particle dynamics, and we discuss its performance against popular
geometric partitioning techniques. Moreover, we show that our effort metric can
be used to rank partitioning techniques by their efficiency at any time point
during the simulation. Eventually, this could be used to choose the best
partitioning on the fly. In the numerical study, we report that our novel
concept increases the performance of two experiments out of three by up to 76%

computer vision. We propose the TransFER model which can learn rich
relation-aware local representations. It mainly consists of three components:
Multi-Attention Dropping (MAD), ViT-FER, and Multi-head Self-Attention Dropping
(MSAD). First, local patches play an important role in distinguishing various
expressions, however, few existing works can locate discriminative and diverse
local patches. This can cause serious problems when some patches are invisible
due to pose variations or viewpoint changes. To address this issue, the MAD is
proposed to randomly drop an attention map. Consequently, models are pushed to
explore diverse local patches adaptively. Second, to build rich relations
between different local patches, the Vision Transformers (ViT) are used in FER,
called ViT-FER. Since the global scope is used to reinforce each local patch, a
better representation is obtained to boost the FER performance. Thirdly, the
multi-head self-attention allows ViT to jointly attend to features from
different information subspaces at different positions. Given no explicit
guidance, however, multiple self-attentions may extract similar relations. To
address this, the MSAD is proposed to randomly drop one self-attention module.
As a result, models are forced to learn rich relations among diverse local
patches. Our proposed TransFER model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
on several FER benchmarks, showing its effectiveness and usefulness.

jargons in the product description, which are ambiguous to translate without
the product image. Secondly, product descriptions are related to the image in
more complicated ways than standard image descriptions, involving various
visual aspects such as objects, shapes, colors or even subjective styles.
Moreover, existing PMT datasets are small in scale to support the research. In
this paper, we first construct a large-scale bilingual product description
dataset called Fashion-MMT, which contains over 114k noisy and 40k manually
cleaned description translations with multiple product images. To effectively
learn semantic alignments among product images and bilingual texts in

However, without node content (i.e., side information) for training, the user

that is, a model trained on one group of users (or items) cannot adapt to new
users (or items). To this end, we propose an inductive matrix completion method

previous GNN-based matrix completion methods. Furthermore, extensive

distinguished 2D keypoints in the 2D image domain and regress their
corresponding 3D coordinates in the local 3D object coordinate first. Then the
2D/3D geometric constraints are built by these correspondences for each object
to boost the detection performance. For generating the ground truth of 2D/3D
keypoints, an automatic model-fitting approach has been proposed by fitting the
deformed 3D object model and the object mask in the 2D image. The proposed

queries, fetching the requested data from existing microservices, REST APIs,

it an attractive candidate for API providers in many industries, especially

GraphQL is that the cost of a query can be unexpectedly large, creating
computation and resource overload for the provider, and API rate-limit overages

necessary to efficiently estimate the cost of a query before executing it.
Estimating query cost is challenging, because GraphQL queries have a nested

have had limited success because they tend to grossly overestimate cost. We

allow coherent sampling over a broad part of the optical spectrum. The addition
of another comb, with a slightly different line spacing, results in a dual
comb. Widely used in spectroscopy, dual combs allow one to read out the broad
frequency response of a sample in a simple electronic measurement. Many dual
comb applications require a high level of mutual coherence between the combs,
but achieving this stability can be demanding. Here, by exploiting the rich
structure of the nonlinear electro-optic tensor in lithium niobate, we generate
ultra-stable dual combs with the two combs naturally having orthogonal
polarizations. Our combs have relative linewidths down to 400 microhertz, and
require no stabilization or post-processing methods. The ultra-high stability

energy and commodity market as the payoff of the option depends on the prices
of a certain underlying observed on a moving window so, when a long window is
considered, the pricing problem becomes high dimensional. We present an
efficient method for pricing Bermudan style moving average options, based on
Gaussian Process Regression and Gauss-Hermite quadrature, thus named GPR-GHQ.
Specifically, the proposed algorithm proceeds backward in time and, at each
time-step, the continuation value is computed only in a few points by using
Gauss-Hermite quadrature, and then it is learned through Gaussian Process
Regression. We test the proposed approach in the Black-Scholes model, where the
GPR-GHQ method is made even more efficient by exploiting the positive
homogeneity of the continuation value, which allows one to reduce the problem
size. Positive homogeneity is also exploited to develop a binomial Markov
chain, which is able to deal efficiently with medium-long windows. Secondly, we
test GPR-GHQ in the Clewlow-Strickland model, the reference framework for
modeling prices of energy commodities. Finally, we consider a challenging
problem which involves double non-Markovian feature, that is the rough-Bergomi
model. In this case, the pricing problem is even harder since the whole history
of the volatility process impacts the future distribution of the process. The
manuscript includes a numerical investigation, which displays that GPR-GHQ is
very accurate and it is able to handle options with a very long window, thus

of the ferroic, and thus manifesting itself as the dielectric loss in the

on the surface potential distribution, complex impedance and dielectric losses
are evidently strong in the vicinity (10-30 K) of the Curie temperature.

handball using positional or video data is of large interest in research and
industry. One requirement is a fundamental understanding of underlying
concepts, i.e., events that occur on the pitch. Previous work often deals only
with so-called low-level events based on well-defined rules such as free kicks,
free throws, or goals. High-level events, such as passes, are less frequently
approached due to a lack of consistent definitions. This introduces a level of
ambiguity that necessities careful validation when regarding event annotations.
Yet, this validation step is usually neglected as the majority of studies adopt
annotations from commercial providers on private datasets of unknown quality
and focuses on soccer only. To address these issues, we present (1) a universal
taxonomy that covers a wide range of low and high-level events for invasion
games and is exemplarily refined to soccer and handball, and (2) release two
multi-modal datasets comprising video and positional data with gold-standard
annotations to foster research in fine-grained and ball-centered event
spotting. Experiments on human performance demonstrate the robustness of the
proposed taxonomy, and that disagreements and ambiguities in the annotation
increase with the complexity of the event. An I3D model for video
classification is adopted for event spotting and reveals the potential for
benchmarking. Datasets are available at: https://github.com/mm4spa/eigd

equations can not be reduced to a single nonlinear wave equation for surface
elevation function. On the other hand, they can be reduced to a single, highly
nonlinear partial differential equation for an auxiliary function $f(x,y,t)$
which determines the velocity potential but is not directly observed quantity.
The solution $f$ of this equation, if known, determines the surface elevation

recently attracted interest in the research community. State-of-the-art
techniques typically learn neurotypical and dysarthric discriminative
representations by processing time-frequency input representations such as the
magnitude spectrum of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). Although these
techniques are expected to leverage perceptual dysarthric cues, representations
such as the magnitude spectrum of the STFT do not necessarily convey perceptual
aspects of complex sounds. Inspired by the temporal processing mechanisms of
the human auditory system, in this paper we factor signals into the product of
a slowly varying envelope and a rapidly varying fine structure. Separately
exploiting the different perceptual cues present in the envelope (i.e.,
phonetic information, stress, and voicing) and fine structure (i.e., pitch,
vowel quality, and breathiness), two discriminative representations are learned
through a convolutional neural network and used for automatic dysarthric speech
detection. Experimental results show that processing both the envelope and fine
structure representations yields a considerably better dysarthric speech
detection performance than processing only the envelope, fine structure, or
magnitude spectrum of the STFT representation.

be a promising building block for a future quantum network. However, a major
limitation of the system is that the coherence time of the magnon excitations

can be transferred to and stored in a distant long-lived mechanical resonator.
The fidelity depends on the pulse parameters and the transmission loss. We
further show that the magnonic and mechanical nodes can be prepared in a
macroscopic entangled state. These demonstrate the quantum state transfer and

pentamode cloak for scattering reduction of elliptical targets in underwater
acoustics. Despite being a well-known theoretical concept, experimental
validations of transformation-based acoustic cloaking for non-axisymmetric
targets have been hindered due to the difficulties related to the complexity of
the required material distribution. We overcome these by adopting a linear
quasi-symmetric map defined in elliptic coordinates that allows for the design
of a pentamode cloak with constant anisotropic elasticity and a scalar
inhomogeneous density. We then perform the long-wavelength homogenization based
optimization of unit cells that implement the computed material distribution.
Numerical validations allow to assess the working range of the designed
microstructure, which depends solely on the ratio between the wavelength and
the size of the microstructure, and is thus expressed in terms of the maximum
normalized wavenumber \kappa L_c, being L_c the characteristic length of the
considered unit cell. The influence on the scattering performance of the cloak
of a pentamode bandgap common to all the cells in the microstructure is also
discussed, finding that it is actually detrimental for the scattering
reduction. Finally, the specimen is fabricated and experimentally tested over
the range 0.45<\kappa L_c<1.34.

relaxation time of the liquid. The non-dimensional median droplet sizes of
different polymer solutions, sprayed at different operating pressures from

the wavelength of the flapping motion responsible for the sheet breakup. We
also show that droplet size distributions, rescaled by the average drop size,
are well described by a compound gamma distribution with parameters $n$ and $m$

relation between the spatial distribution of the magnetic wave power and the
overall field geometry and plasma parameters obtained from multi-height
spectropolarimetric non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) inversions of
IBIS data. We find that, in correspondence with the locations where the
magnetic wave energy is observed at chromospheric heights, the magnetic fields
have smaller scale heights, meaning faster expansions of the field lines, which
ultimately results in stronger vertical density stratification and wave
steepening. In addition, the acoustic spectrum of the oscillations at the
locations where magnetic perturbations are observed is broader than that
observed at other locations, which suggests an additional forcing driver to the
p-modes. Analysis of the photospheric oscillations in the sunspot surroundings
also reveals a broader spectrum in between the two opposite polarities of the
active region (the leading spot and the trailing opposite polarity plage), and
on the same side where magnetic perturbations are observed in the umbra. We
suggest that strong photospheric perturbations in between the two polarities
are responsible for this broader spectrum of oscillations, with respect to the
$p$-mode spectrum, resulting in locally-excited acoustic waves that, after
crossing the equipartition layer, located close to the umbra-penumbra boundary
at photopheric heights, are converted into magnetic-like waves and steepen due
to the strong density gradient.

and are tasked with identifying whether a query example belongs to the same
known class. Most recent advances adopt a deep auto-encoder style architecture
to compute novelty scores for detecting novel class data. Deep networks have
shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, yet little focus is devoted to
studying the adversarial robustness of deep novelty detectors. In this paper,
we first show that existing novelty detectors are susceptible to adversarial
examples. We further demonstrate that commonly-used defense approaches for
classification tasks have limited effectiveness in one-class novelty detection.
Hence, we need a defense specifically designed for novelty detection. To this
end, we propose a defense strategy that manipulates the latent space of novelty
detectors to improve the robustness against adversarial examples. The proposed
method, referred to as Principal Latent Space (PrincipaLS), learns the
incrementally-trained cascade principal components in the latent space to
robustify novelty detectors. PrincipaLS can purify latent space against
adversarial examples and constrain latent space to exclusively model the known
class distribution. We conduct extensive experiments on eight attacks, five
datasets and seven novelty detectors, showing that PrincipaLS consistently
enhances the adversarial robustness of novelty detection models. Code is

multi-faceted challenge in engineering self-adaptive systems. Obtaining
adaptation plans that fulfill system objectives with high utility and in a
timely manner is the holy grail, however, as recent research revealed, it is
not trivial. Hybrid planning is concerned with resolving the time and quality
trade-off via dynamically combining multiple planners that individually aim to
perform either timely or with high quality. The choice of the most fitting
planner is steered based on assessments of runtime information. A hybrid
planner for a self-adaptive system requires (i) a decision-making mechanism
that utilizes (ii) system-level as well as (iii) feedback control-level
information at runtime.
  In this paper, we present HYPEZON, a hybrid planner for self-adaptive
systems. Inspired by model predictive control, HYPEZON leverages receding
horizon control to utilize runtime information during its decision-making.
Moreover, we propose to engineer HYPEZON for self-adaptive systems via two
alternative designs that conform to meta-self-aware architectures.
Meta-self-awareness allows for obtaining knowledge and reasoning about own
awareness via adding a higher-level reasoning entity. HYPEZON aims to address
the problem of hybrid planning by considering it as a case for

local spatial information and incorporating the predictions from a typical

resulting superpixels, the pixels of the input HSI are then grouped into
clusters and fed into our novel discriminative low-rank representation model
with an effective numerical solution. Such a model is capable of increasing the
intra-class similarity by suppressing the spectral variations locally while
promoting the inter-class discriminability globally, leading to a restored HSI
with more discriminative pixels. Experimental results on three benchmark

Importantly, the fine k-grid requires minimal extra computation due to the
simplicity of our approach, which also makes the latter straightforward to
implement. We performed tests on bulk Si, bulk GaAs and monolayer MoS2, all of

large-scale systems with very stringent k-sampling requirements for achieving

multi-step ET and the interplay of sequential and direct superexchange transfer
pathways in the donor-bridge-acceptor (D-B-A) model is increasingly understood,
the influence off-diagonal system-bath interactions on the transfer dynamics is
less explored. Off-diagonal interactions account for the dependence of the ET
coupling elements on nuclear coordinates (non-Condon effects) and are typically
neglected. Here we numerically investigate with quasi-adiabatic propagator path
integral (QUAPI) simulations the impact of off-diagonal system-environment
interactions on the transfer dynamics for a wide range of scenarios in the
D-B-A model. We demonstrate that off-diagonal system-environment interactions
can have profound impact on the bridge-mediated ET dynamics. In the considered

underlying transfer mechanism. Further, we demonstrate how off-diagonal
system-environment interaction mediates anomalous localization by preventing
long-time depopulation of the bridge B and how coherent transfer dynamics
between donor D and acceptor A can be facilitated. The arising non-exponential
short-time dynamics and coherent oscillations are interpreted within an
equivalent Hamiltonian representation of a primary reaction coordinate model

totality path. The visibility of the total solar eclipse from Santa Elena Poco
Uinic would require {\Delta}T: 4074 s < {\Delta}T < 4873 s. In comparison with
the contemporary eclipse records, this yields a short-term increase in
{\Delta}T >= 800 s between 761 and 790 and a decrease in {\Delta}T >= 300 s

between any two subsystems is considered. Because the main section of the model
predictive control is optimization, the hierarchical scheme is performed for
the optimization problem. Furthermore, persistent disturbances are considered
that robust positive invariance and input-to-state stability under such
circumstances are studied. The linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) method is
performed for our computations. So the closed-loop large-scale system is
asymptotically stable. Ultimately, by two examples, the effectiveness of the
proposed method is illustrated, and a comparison with other papers is made by
remarks.

non-detection of traditional cometary volatiles. We examine the ability of
these proposed formation pathways to populate the galaxy with sufficient
interstellar objects such that the detection of 'Oumuamua by Pan-STARRS would

cratering simulations, we show that impacts on extrasolar Kuiper Belt analogues
are not expected to generate N2 ice fragments as large as 'Oumuamua. In
addition, we discuss observational tests to confirm the presence of these ices

attribute 'Oumuamua's properties to other compositions: ultra-porous dust
aggregates and thin membranes powered by solar radiation pressure, among
others. While none of these hypotheses are perfectly satisfactory, we make
predictions that will be testable by the Vera Rubin Observatory to resolve the

because supervised deep learning models require an abundance of accurately

generation of detailed annotations usually demands the input of a pathologist
to be able to distinguish between different tissue constructs and nuclei.
Manually labelling nuclei may not be a feasible approach for collecting
large-scale annotated datasets, especially when a single image region can
contain thousands of different cells. However, solely relying on automatic
generation of annotations will limit the accuracy and reliability of ground
truth. Therefore, to help overcome the above challenges, we propose a
multi-stage annotation pipeline to enable the collection of large-scale

steps. Using this pipeline, we generate the largest known nuclear instance

number $We=5$. We vary the relative thickness of the upper layer between $0.01
\le \alpha \le 0.99$ and the thermal conductivity coefficient ratio of the two
liquids between $0.1 \le \lambda_k \le 10$. Two flow regimes are observed: In
the first regime at $0.04\le\alpha\le0.96$, convective flows appear in both
layers and $Nu$ is not sensitive to $\alpha$. In the second regime at
$\alpha\le0.02$ or $\alpha\ge0.98$, convective flow only exists in the thicker
layer, while the thinner one is dominated by pure conduction. In this regime,
$Nu$ is sensitive to $\alpha$. To predict $Nu$ in the system in which the two
layers are separated by a unique interface, we apply the Grossmann-Lohse theory

stabilizer states and graph states in the absence of the parallel field and
external noise, we identify a specific measurement basis, referred to as the
canonical measurement basis, that optimizes localizable entanglement when
measurement is restricted to single-qubit Pauli measurements only, thereby
providing a lower bound. We also propose an approximation of the lower bound
that can be computed for larger systems according to the computational resource
in hand. Additionally, we compute a lower bound of the localizable entanglement
that can be computed by determining the expectation value of an appropriately
designed witness operator. We study the behavior of these lower bounds in the
vicinity of the topological to nontopological quantum phase transition of the
system, and perform a finite-size scaling analysis. We also investigate the
dynamical features of these lower bounds when the system is subjected to
Markovian or non-Markovian single-qubit dephasing noise. We find that in the
case of the non-Markovian dephasing noise, at large time, the canonical
measurement-based lower bound oscillates with a larger amplitude when the
initial state of the system undergoing dephasing dynamics is chosen from the
nontopological phase, compared to the same for an initial state from the
topological phase. These features can be utilized to distinguish the
topological phase of the system from the nontopological phase in the presence

phenomenon induced by interactions is synchronization of coupled agents, and
the interactive network topology can be tuned to optimize synchronization. The
previous studies showed that the optimized conventional network with pairwise
interactions favors a homogeneous degree distribution of nodes when the
interaction is undirected, and is always structurally asymmetric when the
interaction is directed. However, the optimal control on synchronization for
networks with prevailing higher-order interactions is less explored. Here, by
considering the higher-order interactions in hypergraph and the Kuramoto model
with 2-hyperlink interactions, we find that the network topology with optimized
synchronizability may have distinct properties. For the undirected interaction,
optimized networks with 2-hyperlink interactions by simulated annealing tend to
become homogeneous in the nodes' generalized degree, consistent with
1-hyperlink (pairwise) interactions. We further define the directed hyperlink,
and rigorously demonstrate that for the directed interaction, the structural
symmetry can be preserved in the optimally synchronizable network with
2-hyperlink interactions, in contrast to the conclusion for 1-hyperlink
interactions. The results suggest that controlling the network topology of
higher-order interactions leads to synchronization phenomena beyond pairwise
interactions.

bridged. We identify knowledge gaps in the existing framework for key 5G
technology enablers such as SDN, NFV, and 5G specific signalling protocols of
the core network. We adopt a pre-emptive approach to identifying adversarial
techniques which can be used to launch attacks on the 5G core network (5GCN)
and map these to its components. Using relevant 5G threat assessments along
with industry reports, we study how the domain specific techniques can be
employed by APTs in multi-stage attack scenarios based on historic
telecommunication network attacks and motivation of APT groups. We emulate this
mapping in a pre-emptive fashion to facilitate a rigorous cyber risk
assessment, support intrusion detection, and design defences based on common
APT TTPs in a 5GCN.

capabilities including higher data rates and more connected users. To support
the new capabilities and use cases the 5G Core Network (5GCN) will be dynamic
and reconfigurable in nature to deal with demand. It is these improvements
which also introduce issues for traditional security monitoring methods and
techniques which need to adapt to the new network architecture. The increased
data volumes and dynamic network architecture mean an approach is required to
focus security monitoring resources where it is most needed and react to
network changes in real time. When considering multi-stage threat scenarios a
coordinated, centralised approach to security monitoring is required for the
early detection of attacks which may affect different parts of the network. In
this chapter we identify potential solutions for overcoming these challenges
which begins by identifying the threats to the 5G networks to determine
suitable security monitoring placement in the 5GCN.

clusters of its age and distance in the Solar neighbourhood that ought to
benefit from more attention as it can serve as a cornerstone for numerous
future studies related to star and planet formation.
  Aims: We take advantage of the early installment of the third data release of
the Gaia space mission in combination with archival data and our own
observations, to expand the census of cluster members and revisit some
properties of the cluster.
  Methods: We applied a probabilistic method to infer membership probabilities
over a field of more than 1000 deg${^2}$ to select the most likely cluster
members and derive the distances, spatial velocities, and physical properties
of the stars in this sample.
  Results: We identify 164 high-probability cluster members (including 61 new
members) covering the magnitude range from 5.1 to 19.6 mag in the G-band. Our
sample of cluster members is complete down to 0.04 M$_{\odot}$. We derive the
distance of $108.4\pm0.3$ pc from Bayesian inference and confirm that the
cluster is comoving with the Tucana-Horologium, Columba, and Carina young
stellar associations. We investigate the kinematics of the cluster from a
subsample of stars with measured radial velocities and we do not detect any
significant expansion or rotation effects in the cluster. Our results suggest
that the cluster is somewhat younger (about 30 Myr) than previously thought.
Based on spectroscopic observations, we argue that the cluster is
mass-segregated and that the distribution of spectral types shows little
variation compared to other young stellar groups.
  Conclusions: In this study, we deliver the most complete census of cluster
members that can be done with Gaia data alone and we use this new sample to
provide an updated picture on the 6D structure of the cluster.

We investigate how to explicitly represent clusters onsets in mixture models in

characterize the loosening phenomenon in bolted structure under vibrations. A
comparison with three standard clustering methods on raw streaming data from
five experimental campaigns shows that GMMSEQ not only provides useful
qualitative information about the timeline of clusters, but also shows better
performance in terms of cluster characterization. In view of developing an open

Existing models are not yet able to capture all these constraints effectively,

AccoMontage, an accompaniment arrangement system for whole pieces of music
through unifying phrase selection and neural style transfer. We focus on
generating piano accompaniments for folk/pop songs based on a lead sheet (i.e.,
melody with chord progression). Specifically, AccoMontage first retrieves
phrase montages from a database while recombining them structurally using
dynamic programming. Second, chords of the retrieved phrases are manipulated to
match the lead sheet via style transfer. Lastly, the system offers controls
over the generation process. In contrast to pure learning-based approaches,
AccoMontage introduces a novel hybrid pathway, in which rule-based optimization
and deep learning are both leveraged to complement each other for high-quality
generation. Experiments show that our model generates well-structured
accompaniment with delicate texture, significantly outperforming the baselines.

the Dirac equation in the complex-momentum (Berggren) representation for a
potential with quadrupole deformation at the first order obtained from RMF
calculations using the NL3 interaction, and calculate the continuum level
densities using the Green's function method. We extract s.p. energies and
widths from the continuum level densities to construct Nilsson diagrams, and
analyse the evolution of both the widths and occupation probabilities of
relevant Nilsson orbitals in $^{28}$F and find that some amount of prolate
deformation must be present. In addition, we calculate the density
distributions for bound Nilsson orbitals near the Fermi surface in $^{29,31}$F

in the spherical case the $pf$ shells are already inverted and close to the
neutron emission threshold, a small amount of quadrupole deformation can reduce
the gap between $fp$ shells and increase the role of the continuum, ultimately
leading to the negative parity in the g.s. of $^{28}$F and the halo structures

by a Lennard-Jones potential; (B) An anomalous fluid, such as a liquid metal,
modeled with an isotropic core-softened potential; (C) Water, the prototypical
anomalous liquid, with directional hydrogen bonds. We study how the slit-pore
width affects the structure, thermodynamics, and dynamics of the fluids. We
check that all the fluids, as expected, show similar oscillating properties by
changing the pore size. However, the nature of the free-energy minima for the
three fluids is quite different: i) only for the simple liquid all the minima
are energy-driven, while their structural order increases with decreasing
slit-pore width; ii) only for the isotropic core-softened potential all the
minima are entropy-driven, while the energy in the minima increases with
decreasing slit-pore width; iii) only the water has a changing nature of the
minima: the monolayer minimum is entropy-driven, at variance with the simple
liquid, while the bilayer minimum is energy-driven, at variance with the other
anomalous liquid. Also, water diffusion has a large increase for sub-nm
slit-pores, becoming faster than bulk. Instead, the other two fluids have
diffusion oscillations much smaller than water slowing down for decreasing
slit-pore width. Our results clarify that nanoconfined water is unique compared

(local hydrology or climate projections), and turbulent fluxes can be an
important contributor to glacier surface mass balance during strong melting
events. The underlying complex terrain leads to spatial heterogeneity and
non-stationarity of turbulent fluxes. Due to the contribution of
thermally-induced flows and gravity waves, exchange mechanisms are fully
three-dimensional, instead of only vertical. Additionally, glaciers have their
own distinct microclimate, governed by a down-glacier katabatic wind, which
protects the glacier ice and interacts with the surrounding flows on multiple
scales. In this study, we perform large-eddy simulations with the WRF model
with dx=48 m to gain insight on the boundary-layer processes over an Alpine
valley glacier, the Hintereisferner (HEF). We choose two case studies from a
measurement campaign (August 2018) with different synoptic wind directions
(South-West and North-West). Model evaluation with an array of eddy-covariance
stations on the glacier tongue and surroundings reveals that WRF is able to
simulate the general glacier boundary-layer structure. Under southwesterly
airflow, the down-glacier wind is supported by the South-Western synoptic wind
direction, a stable boundary layer is present over the ice surface, and local
processes govern the turbulence kinetic energy production. Under northwesterly
airflow, a cross-glacier valley flow and a breaking gravity wave lead strong
turbulent mixing and to the subsequent erosion of the glacier boundary layer.
Stationarity analyses of the sensible heat flux suggest non-stationary
behaviour for both case study days, while non-stationarity is highest on the NW
day during the gravity-wave event. These results suggest that the synoptic wind
direction has, in addition to upstream topography and the atmospheric
stability, a strong impact on whether a local glacier boundary layer can form
or not, influencing whether a glacier is able to maintain its own microclimate.

potential-less $k$-essence $f(R)$ gravity model in the presence of radiation
and non-relativistic perfect matter fluids. The two $f(R)$ gravity models were
carefully chosen in order for them to describe in a unified way inflation and
the dark energy era, in both cases viable and compatible with the latest Planck
data. Also both models mimic the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model and
specifically the pure $f(R)$ model only at late times, but the Chern-Simons
$k$-essence model during the whole evolution of the model up to the radiation
domination era. In addition they guarantee a smooth transition from the
inflationary era to the radiation, matter domination and subsequently to the
dark energy era. Using a WKB approach introduced in the relevant literature by
Nishizawa, we derive formulas depending on the redshift that yield the modified
gravity effect, quantified by a multiplicative factor, a ``damping'' in front
of the General Relativistic waveform. In order to calculate the effect of the
modified gravity, which is the ``damping'' factor, we solve numerically the
Friedmann equations using appropriate initial conditions and by introducing
specific statefinder quantities. As we show, the pure $f(R)$ gravity
gravitational wave energy spectrum is slightly enhanced, but it remains well
below the sensitivity curves of future gravitational waves experiments. In
contrast, the Chern-Simons $k$-essence $f(R)$ gravity model gravitational wave
energy spectrum is significantly enhanced and two signals are predicted which
can be verified by future gravitational wave experiments.

number of distinct models of MBH and galaxy evolution processes within a
consistent framework and it was also successfully tested against current

models that vary in terms of their MBH seed formation scenarios and we tested
two different MBH growth and feedback models.
  Based on our estimates, we find that LISA will be able to detect several to
several tens of merger events per year for the most and least massive seed
scenarios, respectively. We also show that the strength of this relation
depends on the MBH growth model, where in the most extreme case, we find twice
as many detected events for the same initial seed masses. Finally, we estimated
the amplitude of the GW background at nHz frequencies to be on the order of
$1.4\cdot10^{-16} - 1.1\cdot10^{-15}$. This value depends solely on the time

temporal variations of the particle-induced background of Chandra ACIS obtained
in the two data modes, VFAINT and FAINT. Observations performed with ACIS in
the stowed position shielded from the sky and the Chandra Deep Field South data
sets are used. The spectra are modeled with a combination of the instrumental
lines of Al, Si, Ni, and Au and continuum components. Similar spatial
variations of the spectral shape are found in VFAINT and FAINT data, which are
mainly due to inappropriate correction of charge transfer inefficiency for
events that convert in the frame-store regions as explained by Bartalucci et
al. 2014. Temporal variation of the spectral hardness ratio is found to be
$\sim 10\%$ at maximum, which seems to be largely due to solar activity. We
model this variation by modifying the spectral hardnesses according to the
total count rate. Incorporating these properties, we have developed a tool
``mkacispback'' to generate the particle-induced background spectral model

we use the background spectrum produced by the mkacispback tool in an analysis

tenants through containers. Each function invocation (action) runs in an
individual container. When there is not an already started container for a user
function, a new container has to be created for it. However, the long cold
startup time of a container results in the long response latency of the action.
Our investigation shows that the containers for some user actions share most of
the software packages. If an action that requires a new container can
``borrow'' a similar warm container from other actions, the long cold startup
can be eliminated. Based on the above finding, we propose Pagurus, a runtime
container management system for eliminating the cold startup in serverless
computing. Pagurus is comprised of an inter-action container scheduler and an
intra-action container scheduler for each action. The inter-action container
scheduler schedules shared containers among actions. The intra-action container
scheduler deals with the management of the container lifecycle. Our

spatial and temporal features of motions, and the decoder uses a graph-based
attention gate recurrent unit (GA-GRU) to generate future poses. Extensive

Coolen, Tahani Coolen-Maturi","Direct Nonparametric Predictive Inference Classification Trees","33 pages",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Classification is the task of assigning a new instance to one of a set of
predefined categories based on the attributes of the instance. A classification
tree is one of the most commonly used techniques in the area of classification.
In this paper, we introduce a novel classification tree algorithm which we call
Direct Nonparametric Predictive Inference (D-NPI) classification algorithm. The
D-NPI algorithm is completely based on the Nonparametric Predictive Inference
(NPI) approach, and it does not use any other assumption or information. The
NPI is a statistical methodology which learns from data in the absence of prior
knowledge and uses only few modelling assumptions, enabled by the use of lower
and upper probabilities to quantify uncertainty. Due to the predictive nature
of NPI, it is well suited for classification, as the nature of classification
is explicitly predictive as well. The D-NPI algorithm uses a new split
criterion called Correct Indication (CI). The CI is about the informativity
that the attribute variables will indicate, hence, if the attribute is very
informative, it gives high lower and upper probabilities for CI. The CI reports
the strength of the evidence that the attribute variables will indicate, based
on the data. The CI is completely based on the NPI, and it does not use any
additional concepts such as entropy. The performance of the D-NPI
classification algorithm is tested against several classification algorithms
using classification accuracy, in-sample accuracy and tree size on different
datasets from the UCI machine learning repository. The experimental results
indicate that the D-NPI classification algorithm performs well in terms of
classification accuracy and in-sample accuracy.

ultracold neutrons (UCN) in material traps now provides the most accurate
measurements of neutron lifetime and is used in many other experiments. The
precision of these measurements is limited by the interaction of UCN with the
trap walls. We show that covering trap walls with liquid helium may strongly
decrease the UCN losses from material traps. $^4$He does not absorb neutrons at
all. Superfluid He covers the trap walls as a thin film, $\sim 10$ nm thick,
due to the van der Waals attraction. However, this He film on a flat wall is
too thin to protect the UCN from their absorption inside a trap material. By
combining the van der Waals attraction with capillary effects we show that
surface roughness may increase the thickness of this film much beyond the
neutron penetration depth $\sim 33$nm. Using liquid He for UCN storage requires
low temperature $T<0.5$ K to avoid neutron interaction with He vapor, while the
neutron losses because of the interaction with surface waves are small and can
be accounted for using their linear temperature dependence.

improving their networking performance. State-of-the-art online coflow
schedulers in essence approximate the classic Shortest-Job-First (SJF)
scheduling by learning the coflow size online. In particular, they use multiple
priority queues to simultaneously accomplish two goals: to sieve long coflows
from short coflows, and to schedule short coflows with high priorities. Such a
mechanism pays high overhead in learning the coflow size: moving a large coflow
across the queues delays small and other large coflows, and moving
similar-sized coflows across the queues results in inadvertent round-robin
scheduling. We propose Philae, a new online coflow scheduler that exploits the
spatial dimension of coflows, i.e., a coflow has many flows, to drastically
reduce the overhead of coflow size learning. Philae pre-schedules sampled flows
of each coflow and uses their sizes to estimate the average flow size of the
coflow. It then resorts to Shortest Coflow First, where the notion of shortest
is determined using the learned coflow sizes and coflow contention. We show
that the sampling-based learning is robust to flow size skew and has the added
benefit of much improved scalability from reduced coordinator-local agent
interactions. Our evaluation using an Azure testbed, a publicly available
production cluster trace from Facebook shows that compared to the prior art
Aalo, Philae reduces the coflow completion time (CCT) in average (P90) cases by
1.50x (8.00x) on a 150-node testbed and 2.72x (9.78x) on a 900-node testbed.

high spatial resolution remote sensing observations is important research in

widely used in a variety of real-world applications, such as map updating. As
manual high resolution image interpretation is expensive and time-consuming,
building change detection methods are of high interest. The interest in
developing building change detection approaches from optical remote sensing
images is rapidly increasing due to larger coverages, and lower costs of
optical images. In this study, we focus on building change detection analysis
on a small set of building change from different regions that sit in several

building change detection using Monte Carlo dropout and remote sensing
observations. The setup is based on a small dataset, including bitemporal

modified through the migration of ions within a liquid or solid electrolyte, is
a fast developing research field. This is mainly due to the perspective of
energy efficient magnetic devices, in which the magnetization direction is
controlled not by a magnetic field or an electrical current, as done in
traditional devices, but by an electric field, leading to a considerable
reduction of energy consumption.
  In this work, the interfacial perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) of a
series of Pt/Co/oxide trilayers covered by a ZrO$_2$ layer, acting as a ionic
conductor, was finely tuned by a gate voltage at room temperature. The
non-volatility and the time evolution of the effect point at oxygen ion
migration across the ZrO$_2$ layer as the driving mechanism. A large variation
of the PMA is obtained by modifying the degree of oxidation of the cobalt layer
with the flux of oxygen ions: the easy magnetization axis can be switched
reversibly from in-plane, with an under-oxidized Co, to in-plane, with an
over-oxidized Co, passing through an out-of-plane magnetization with maximum
PMA. The switching time between the different magnetic states is limited by the
oxygen ion drift velocity through the multilayer structure. This was shown to
depend exponentially on the applied bias voltage, and could be varied by over 5
orders of magnitude, from several minutes to a few ms. On the other hand, for a
fixed gate-voltage, the oxidation of the cobalt layer decreases exponentially
as a function of time. This behavior is in agreement with the theoretical model
developed by Cabrera and Mott (1949) to explain the growth of very thin oxides
at low temperatures. The possibility to explain the observed effect with a
relatively simple theoretical model opens the possibility to engineers
materials with optimized properties.

satellite. Three galaxies in our sample have a very close satellite. The spots
of enhanced s in those galaxies are located at the edge of the galaxy close to
the satellite. The spots of enhanced s in three other galaxies are related to
bright spots in the photometric B band within the galaxy, which can be due to
the projection of a satellite in the line of sight of the galaxy. The oxygen
abundances in the spots in these three galaxies are reduced. This suggests that
the low-metallicity gas from the satellite is mixed with the interstellar
medium of the disk. The spectra of the spaxels within a spot are usually
HII-region-like, suggesting that the interaction in those galaxies does not
result in appreciable shocks. In contrast, the spot of the enhanced s in the
galaxy M-8716-12703 is associated with an off-centered AGN-like radiation

which is based on the penalty function, the method of multipliers solves the

leads to a two-step recursive algorithm. The primal step requires solving an
unconstrained minimization problem like the traditional FWI with a difference
that the data are replaced by the Lagrange multipliers. The dual step involves
an update of the Lagrange multipliers. The overall performance of the algorithm
is improved considering that this multiplier method does not require an exact

when only one step of a gradient-based method is taken on both subproblems. The
proposed algorithm greatly improves the overall performance of FWI such as
convergence from inaccurate starting models and robustness with respect to the
determination of the step length. Furthermore, it can be performed by the
existing FWI engines with minimal change. We only have to replace the observed

Kibble-Zurek scaling of topological defect density for a linear driving across

usually realized by taking an extremal limit from the nonextremal case.
However, one cannot perceive the same phenomenon using the Bogoliubov
transformation method starting from an extremal black hole itself, i.e.,
without the limiting case consideration. In that case, the Bogoliubov
coefficients do not satisfy the required normalization condition. In canonical
formulation, which closely mimics the Bogoliubov transformation method, one can
consistently reproduce the vanishing number density of Hawking quanta for an
extremal Kerr black hole. In this method, the relation between the spatial
near-null coordinates, imperative in understanding the Hawking effect, was
approximated into a sum of linear and inverse terms only. In the present work,
we first show that one can reach the same conclusion in canonical formulation
even with the complete relationship between the near-null coordinates, which
contains an additional logarithmic term. It is worth mentioning that in the
nonextremal case, a similar logarithmic term alone leads to the thermal Hawking
radiation. Secondly, we study the case with only the inverse term in the
relation (i.e., when the spatial near-null coordinates associated to the past
and future observers are inversely related to each other) to understand whether
it is the main contributing term in vanishing number density. Third, for a
qualitative realization, we consider a simple thought experiment to understand
the corresponding Hawking temperature and conclude that the inverse term indeed
plays a crucial role in the vanishing number density.

The total protoplanetary
disc mass is the most fundamental parameter, since it sets the mass budget for
planet formation. Although observations with the Atacama Large
Millimeter/Submillimeter array (ALMA) have dramatically increased our
understanding of these discs, total protoplanetary disc mass remains difficult
to measure. If a disc is sufficiency massive ($\gtrsim$ 10\% of the host star
mass), it can excite gravitational instability (GI). Recently, it has been
revealed that GI leaves kinematic imprints of its presence known as the ""GI
Wiggle."" In this work, we use numerical simulations to empirically determine an
approximately linear relationship between the amplitude of the wiggle and the
host disc-to-star mass ratio, and show that measurements of the amplitude are
possible with the spatial and spectral capabilities of ALMA. These measurements
can therefore be used to constrain disc-to-star mass ratio.

imaging, which provides insight into the underlying rock and ice. However,
systematic noise is introduced into the data during collection, complicating
interpretation of the results. Researchers most often use a combination of
manual interpretation and filtering techniques to denoise data; however, these
processes are time intensive and inconsistent. Fully Convolutional Networks
have been proposed as an automated alternative to identify layer boundaries in
radargrams. However, they require high-quality manually processed training data
and struggle to interpolate data in noisy samples (Varshney et al. 2020).
  Herein, the authors propose a GAN based model to interpolate layer boundaries
through noise and highlight layers in two-dimensional glacial RES data. In
real-world noisy images, filtering often results in loss of data such that
interpolating layer boundaries is nearly impossible. Furthermore, traditional
machine learning approaches are not suited to this task because of the lack of
paired data, so we employ an unpaired image-to-image translation model. For
this model, we create a synthetic dataset to represent the domain of images
with clear, highlighted layers and use an existing real-world RES dataset as
our noisy domain.
  We implement a CycleGAN trained on these two domains to highlight layers in
noisy images that can interpolate effectively without significant loss of
structure or fidelity. Though the current implementation is not a perfect
solution, the model clearly highlights layers in noisy data and allows
researchers to determine layer size and position without mathematical
filtering, manual processing, or ground-truth images for training. This is
significant because clean images generated by our model enable subsurface
researchers to determine glacial layer thickness more efficiently.

duration is linearly related to the type II burst duration indicating that >300
MeV protons required for SGREs are accelerated by the same shock that
accelerates tens of keV electrons that produce type II bursts. When
magnetically well connected, the associated solar energetic particle (SEP)
event has a hard spectrum, indicating copious acceleration of high-energy
protons. In one of the SGRE events observed on 2014 January 7 by Fermi/LAT, the
SEP event detected by GOES has a very soft spectrum with not many particles
beyond 100 MeV. This contradicts the presence of the SGRE, implying the
presence of significant number of >300 MeV protons. Furthermore, the durations
of the type II burst and the SGRE agree with the known linear relationship
between them (Gopalswamy et al. 2018, ApJ 868, L19). We show that the soft
spectrum is due to poor magnetic connectivity of the shock nose to an Earth
observer. Even though the location of the eruption (S15W11) is close to the
disk center, the CME propagated non-radially making the CME flank crossing the
ecliptic rather than the nose. High-energy particles are accelerated near the
nose, so they do not reach GOES but they do precipitate to the vicinity of the
eruption region to produce SGRE. This study provides further evidence that SGRE
is caused by protons accelerated in shocks and propagating sunward to interact
with the atmospheric ions.

scattering model (ASM) have achieved remarkable results. However, it is noted
that ASM-based SIDM degrades its performance in dehazing real world hazy images
due to the limited modelling ability of ASM where the atmospheric light factor
(ALF) and the angular scattering coefficient (ASC) are assumed as constants for
one image. Obviously, the hazy images taken in real world cannot always satisfy
this assumption. Such generating modelling mismatch between the real-world
images and ASM sets up the upper bound of trained ASM-based SIDM for dehazing.
Bearing this in mind, in this study, a new fully non-homogeneous atmospheric
scattering model (FNH-ASM) is proposed for well modeling the hazy images under
complex conditions where ALF and ASC are pixel dependent. However, FNH-ASM
brings difficulty in practical application. In FNH-ASM based SIDM, the
estimation bias of parameters at different positions lead to different
distortion of dehazing result. Hence, in order to reduce the influence of
parameter estimation bias on dehazing results, two new cost sensitive loss
functions, beta-Loss and D-Loss, are innovatively developed for limiting the
parameter bias of sensitive positions that have a greater impact on the
dehazing result. In the end, based on FNH-ASM, an end-to-end CNN-based dehazing
network, FNHD-Net, is developed, which applies beta-Loss and D-Loss.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our
proposed FNHD-Net for dehazing on both synthetic and real-world images. And the
performance improvement of our method increases more obviously in dense and
heterogeneous haze scenes.

fallback strategies when AI predictions cannot be trusted. Certifiers for
neural networks are a reliable way to check the robustness of these
predictions. They guarantee for some predictions that a certain class of
manipulations or attacks could not have changed the outcome. For the remaining
predictions without guarantees, the method abstains from making a prediction
and a fallback strategy needs to be invoked, which typically incurs additional
costs, can require a human operator, or even fail to provide any prediction.
While this is a key concept towards safe and secure AI, we show for the first
time that this approach comes with its own security risks, as such fallback
strategies can be deliberately triggered by an adversary. Using training-time
attacks, the adversary can significantly reduce the certified robustness of the
model, making it unavailable. This transfers the main system load onto the
fallback, reducing the overall system's integrity and availability. We design
two novel backdoor attacks which show the practical relevance of these threats.
For example, adding 1% poisoned data during training is sufficient to reduce
certified robustness by up to 95 percentage points. Our extensive experiments
across multiple datasets, model architectures, and certifiers demonstrate the
wide applicability of these attacks. A first investigation into potential
defenses shows that current approaches are insufficient to mitigate the issue,
highlighting the need for new, more specific solutions.

of conventional Air Traffic Management (ATM), but brings new complexities and
challenges of its own. One of its ways of guaranteeing separation is the use of
airborne, stand-alone Detect-And-Avoid, an operational concept where each
aircraft decides its avoidance maneuvers independently, observing right-of-way
rules and, in specific implementations, some form of pairwise coordination.
This is a fundamental safety element for autonomous aircraft but, according to
our research, is not sufficient for high-density airspaces as envisioned for
urban environments. In these environments, some way of explicit and strategic
traffic coordination must be in place, as done for conventional ATM. For
efficiency reasons, ATM is evolving to more flexible uses of the airspace, such
that the use of dynamically allocated corridors is a rising concept for AAM.
These strategic forms of traffic coordination are potentially highly efficient
if the aircraft adhere to their trajectory contracts and there are no
significant perturbations to the traffic. However, if significant perturbations
occur, such as loss of data communication, or the sudden appearance of an
intruder, a centralized system may not react appropriately in due time. In busy
scenarios, even small deviations from plans may compound so rapidly as to
result in large differences in the overall achieved scenario, resulting in
congestions and convoluted conflicts. Therefore, it is worth studying traffic
coordination techniques that work locally with shorter look-ahead times. To
that end, we explore an airborne collaborative method for traffic coordination,
which is capable of safely solving conflicts with multiple aircraft, stressing
its capabilities throughout a large number of scenarios and comparing its
performance with established methods.

planned maintenance activities may have significant consequences on the

with the mitigation of planned service interruptions and to guarantee a
seamless journey and a good travel experience for passengers, it is possible to
exploit the existing services differently and/or provide additional on-demand
services, such as temporary supplemental bus lines. In this context, this paper
aims to develop a mathematical programming model for planning service
interruptions due to maintenance considering passenger transport demand
dynamics. In particular, the proposed approach deals with service interruptions
characterized by a long duration for which timetable adaption strategies are
not applicable, suggesting mitigation actions that exploit the already existing
services and/or the activation of additional ones, with the aim of minimizing
users' inconvenience. In doing so, the planned infrastructure status (i.e.,
available or under maintenance), as well as the forecasted transport demand,
are taken into account to adapt the service accordingly by offering a
multimodal transport solution to passengers. To find the best solution, a
decomposition solution approach is proposed in combination with a multistage
cooperative framework with feedback that models the negotiation process between
the involved actors. Finally, the applicability of the proposed approach to
real case studies is discussed based on some performance indicators.

strategic and tactical airspace deconfliction, where the need for coordination
appears in different forms and nuances. One recurring element is the use of
pre-defined airways or corridors, a natural way to create order, with proven
success from the conventional, manned, Air Traffic Management (ATM). But, while
ATM is evolving to 4D Trajectory-Based Operations, when we apply the ATM
principles to very dense and potentially more complex operations such as AAM,
we have to consider their limitations in such demanding new environment. The
requirement of following circulation corridors most often increase flight
distance and inevitably create bottlenecks, hence we explore the hypothesis of
not using corridors, testing such option via a simple and scalable simulation
model. Other motivations for comparing different forms of traffic coordination
are redundancy and diversity, which have potential to increase system safety.
Relying on a single method to maintain traffic separation of course would not
be allowed in practice. However, the concepts that we have seen so far leave a
gap between two very distinct and co-existing methods: one, cooperative and
centered on a ground-based Provider of Services for UAM (PSU), and another,
which is mostly non-cooperative and independent, centered on the individual
aircraft, commonly referred to as Detect-And-Avoid (DAA). This duality achieves
a welcomed diversity, however presents several points for improvement.
  In-between these opposite methods, this paper analyzes the performance of an
airborne cooperative method to coordinate traffic which is capable of safely
solving conflicts of multiple aircraft (more than two) and achieve higher
efficiency than DAA alone, thus with potential for being an alternative or a
live fallback for ground-based traffic coordination.

model also has provision for leveraging self-supervision on concepts to extract
better explanations. However, with full concept supervision, we achieve the
best predictive performance compared to recently proposed concept-based
explainable models. We report both qualitative and quantitative results with
our method, which shows better performance than recently proposed concept-based
explainability methods. We reported exhaustive results with two datasets
without ground truth concepts, i.e., CIFAR10, ImageNet, and two datasets with

by studying in vitro and in silico the progression of dissection driven by
quasi-static pressurization of the intramural space by fluid injection, which
demonstrates that the differential propensity of dissection can be affected by
spatial distributions of structurally significant interlamellar struts that
connect adjacent elastic lamellae. In particular, diverse histological
microstructures may lead to differential mechanical behavior during dissection,
including the pressure--volume relationship of the injected fluid and the
displacement field between adjacent lamellae. In this study, we develop a

different fields of practice. It is therefore critically important to adhere to
a taxonomy that explicitly describes positions and movements. However, current
representation methods such as cardan and Euler angles fail to report shoulder
angles in a way that is easily and correctly interpreted by practitioners, and
that is free from numerical instability such as gimbal lock. Methods: In this
paper, we comprehensively describe the recent Tilt-and-Torsion method and
compare it to the Euler YXY method currently recommended by the International
Society of Biomechanics. While using the same three rotations (plane of
elevation, elevation, humeral rotation), the Tilt-and-Torsion method reports
humeral rotation independently from the plane of elevation. We assess how it
can be used to describe shoulder angles (1) in a simulated assessment of
humeral rotation with the arm at the side, which constitutes a gimbal lock
position, and (2) during an experimental functional task, with 10 wheelchair
basketball athletes who sprint in straight line using a sports wheelchair.
Findings: In the simulated gimbal lock experiment, the Tilt-and-Torsion method
provided both humeral elevation and rotation measurements, contrary to the
Euler YXY method. During the wheelchair sprints, humeral rotation ranged from
14{\deg} (externally) to 13{\deg} (internally), which is consistent with
typical maximal ranges of humeral rotation, compared to 65{\deg} to 50{\deg}
with the Euler YXY method. Interpretation: Based on our results, we recommend
that shoulder angles be expressed using Tilt-and-Torsion angles instead of
Euler YXY.

aligned in a polarized beam. This is a nunber of polarized particles large
enough for the beam polarization to be detected externally, and fed back to
permit external control of the beam polarization. The level of achievable spin
control, though classical, not quantum mechanical, can be comparable to the
control of one or a small number of polarized particles in a low energy trap.
  Motivated to investigate time reversal invariance, especially the detection
of non-zero electric dipole moments (EDMs) this paper describes the design of a
low energy storage ring having the superimposed electric and magnetic bending
needed to ""freeze"" the spins of polarized beams. For electrons (of either sign)
and protons the spins can be frozen with all-electric bending but, in general,
superimposed electric/magnetic bending is required. Since constructive bending
superposition in one direction implies destructive superposition in the other
direction, counter-circulating beams must differ, either in particle type or
momentum, in order for their orbits to be identical.
  For globally frozen spin operation the bunch polarizations remain constant
relative to the momenta, for example remaining parallel to the circuating beam
momentum vectors. With superimposed electric and magnetic bending, the globally
frozen spin condition can be met over a continua (specific to particle type) of
E/B ratios. When this condition is met, the out-of-plane, EDM-induced
precession accumulates monitonically, which is obligatory for producing a
measurably large EDM signal. As Koop has explained, the EDM signal will still
accumulate if the polarization is allowed to ""roll like a wheel"" around a
radial axis.

consequence, reconstructed markers in CBCT volumes suffer from artifacts and
have distorted shapes, which sets an obstacle for navigation. In this work, we
propose two fiducial marker detection methods: direct detection from distorted
markers (direct method) and detection after marker recovery (recovery method).
For direct detection from distorted markers in reconstructed volumes, an
efficient automatic marker detection method using two neural networks and a
conventional circle detection algorithm is proposed. For marker recovery, a
task-specific learning strategy is proposed to recover markers from severely
truncated data. Afterwards, a conventional marker detection algorithm is
applied for position detection. The two methods are evaluated on simulated data

Our experiments demonstrate that the direct method is capable of detecting
distorted markers accurately and the recovery method with task-specific
learning has high robustness and generalizability on various data sets.

wave-function in 2D Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) by angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we developed a theoretical study to resolve
some characteristics of these excitons and some of the many open issues in
these systems. The system is assumed to be embedded in an environment with
average dielectric constant, below which electrostatic interactions in the
corresponding TMD layer are screened. We adopt the long range approximation,
which gives the electron-hole interaction in the Rytova - Keldysh form. Latter
allows understanding the role of screening in TMDs structures. The bound state
1s 2s energy eigenvalues for the twodimensional are reformulated in momentum

then expanded in terms of spherical harmonics. To evaluate the dynamic of the
angle resolved photoemission spectrum arising from the dissociation of excitons
given their steady states 1s 2s expressions, we follow the semi perturbative
theoretical description developed by previous calculations. We discuss the
dielectric environment effect on the dispersive features of the spectrum for
different 1s and 2s exciton distributions. Quantum beat signatures in
photoemission intensity demonstrate coherent coupling between 1s and 2s
excitons. The beating contribution due to excitonic coherence is also
discussed. The periodic oscillations arising from coherent superposition
states, quantum beats, enable exploration of novel coherent phenomena.

asymptotics do not give conclusions for fixed $n$. We prove that the maximal

  These results are mostly based on the analysis of synchronizing word lengths

it contains the well-known \v{C}ern\'y automata; for $n\leq 10$ it contains a
binary PFA with maximal possible reset threshold; for all $n\geq 6$ it contains
a PFA with reset threshold larger than the maximum known for DFAs.
  Analysis of this family reveals remarkable patterns involving the Fibonacci
numbers and related sequences such as the Padovan sequence. We derive explicit
formulas for the reset thresholds in terms of these recurrent sequences.
  Asymptotically the \v{C}ern\'y family gives reset thresholds of polynomial
order. We prove that PFAs in the family are not extremal for $n\geq 41$. For

Provided that the dark matter mass is higher than a few hundred GeV, the

No significant VHE gamma-ray emission is detected in any UFO dataset nor in
their combination. We, therefore, derive constraints on the product of the

large scale-free networks. The correlation matrix considered is
$P(h|k)=(1-r)P^U_{hk}+r\delta_{hk}$, where $P^U$ is uncorrelated and $r$ (the
Newman assortativity coefficient) can be very small. The effect is uniform in
the scale exponent $\gamma$, if the network size is measured by the largest
degree $n$. We also prove that it is possible to construct, via the Porto-Weber
method, correlation matrices which have the same $k_{nn}$ as the $P(h|k)$
above, but very different elements and spectrum, and thus lead to different
epidemic diffusion and threshold. Moreover, we study a subset of the admissible
transformations of the form $P(h|k) \to P(h|k)+\Phi(h,k)$ with $\Phi(h,k)$
depending on a parameter which leave $k_{nn}$ invariant. Such transformations
affect in general the epidemic threshold. We find however that this does not
happen when they act between networks with constant $k_{nn}$, i.e. networks in
which the average neighbor degree is independent from the degree itself (a
wider class than that of strictly uncorrelated networks).

motion of the solar system with velocity of 370 km/s. Since this derives from
peculiar motions and local inhomogeneities, one could meaningfully consider a
fundamental frame of rest $\Sigma$ associated with the Universe as a whole.
From the group properties of Lorentz transformations, two observers,
individually moving within $\Sigma$, would still be connected by the
relativistic composition rules. But ultimate implications could be substantial.
Physical interpretation is thus traditionally demanded to correlating some
dragging of light observed in laboratory with the direct CMB observations.
Today the small residuals, from Michelson-Morley to present experiments with
optical resonators, are just considered instrumental artifacts. However, if the
velocity of light in the interferometers is not the same parameter ""c"" of
Lorentz transformations, nothing would prevent a non-zero dragging.
Furthermore, observable effects would be much smaller than classically expected
and most likely of irregular nature. We review an alternative reading of
experiments which leads to remarkable correlations with the CMB observations.
Notably, we explain the irregular $10^{-15}$ fractional frequency shift
presently measured with optical resonators operating in vacuum and solid
dielectrics. For integration times of about 1 second, and typical
Central-Europe latitude, we also predict daily variations of the Allan variance

no previous research has adequately addressed this problem. This research paper
thus presents an evaluation that investigated the effects of background stories
on graph perception. Three hypotheses that focused on the role of visual focus
areas, graph structure identification, and mental model formation on graph
perception were formulated and guided three controlled experiments that
evaluated the hypotheses using real-world graphs with background stories. An
analysis of the resulting experimental data, which compared the performance of
participants who read and did not read the background stories, obtained a set
of instructive findings. First, having knowledge about a graph's background
story influences participants' focus areas during interactive graph
explorations. Second, such knowledge significantly affects one's ability to
identify community structures but not high degree and bridge structures. Third,
this knowledge influences graph recognition under blurred visual conditions.
These findings can bring new considerations to the design of storytelling
