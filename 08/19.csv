general-purpose stages (e.g., pre-processing, encoder, cross-modal interaction,
decoder, and decode strategy). Each stage is empowered with the functionality
that covers a series of modules widely adopted in state-of-the-arts and allows
seamless switching in between. This way naturally enables a flexible
implementation of state-of-the-art algorithms for image captioning, video

development of research community. Meanwhile, since the effective modular
designs in several stages (e.g., cross-modal interaction) are shared across
different vision-language tasks, X-modaler can be simply extended to power
startup prototypes for other tasks in cross-modal analytics, including visual
question answering, visual commonsense reasoning, and cross-modal retrieval.

the tight-binding model is often coupled with a nearest-neighbour

for simulating multicomponent flows with inter-phase heat transfer, diffusion
processes (including the viscosity and the heat conduction) and external energy
sources. We derive three equivalent formulations for the proposed model. All
the three formulations assume velocity and pressure equilibrium across the
material interface. These equivalent forms provide different physical
perspectives and numerical conveniences. Temperature equilibration and
continuity across the material interfaces are achieved with the instantaneous
thermal relaxation. Temperature equilibrium is maintained during the heat
conduction process. The proposed models are proved to respect the
thermodynamical laws. For numerical solution, the model is split into a
hyperbolic partial differential equation (PDE) system and parabolic PDE
systems. The former is solved with the high-order Godunov finite volume method
that ensures the pressure-velocity-temperature (PVT) equilibrium conduction.
The parabolic PDEs are solved with both the implicit and the explicit locally
iterative method (LIM) based on Chebyshev parameters. Numerical results are
presented for several multicomponent flow problems with diffusion processes.
Furthermore, we apply the proposed model to simulate the target ablation
problem that is of significance to inertial confinement fusion. Comparisons
with one-temperature models in literature demonstrate the ability to maintain
the PVT property and superior convergence performance of the proposed model in
solving multicomponent problems with diffusions.

text strength indicator (TSI) which: (i) predicts the click-through-rate (CTR)
for an input ad text, (ii) fetches similar existing ads to create a
neighborhood around the input ad, (iii) and compares the predicted CTRs in the

suggestions for ad text improvement, TSI shows anonymized versions of superior
ads (higher predicted CTR) in the neighborhood. For (i), we propose a BERT

real-time applications by interconnecting billions of sensors/devices deployed

wide-area wireless connectivity for transmitting, mostly fixed- but small-size,
status updates of their associated random processes. The cellular networks are
seen as a natural candidate for providing reliable wireless connectivity to IoT
devices. However, the conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) to these
massive number of devices is expected to degrade the spectral efficiency. As a
promising alternative to OMA, the cellular base stations (BSs) can employ
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for the uplink transmissions of mobile
users and IoT devices. In particular, the uplink NOMA can be configured such
that the mobile user can adapt transmission rate based on its channel condition
while the IoT device transmits at a fixed rate. For this setting, we analyze
the ergodic capacity of mobile users and the mean local delay of IoT devices
using stochastic geometry. Our analysis demonstrates that the above NOMA
configuration can provide better ergodic capacity for mobile users compare to
OMA when IoT devices' delay constraint is strict. Furthermore, we also show
that NOMA can support a larger packet size for IoT devices than OMA under the

regard that the fluid matter is made up for nucleons and electrons confined in
a Wigner-Seitz cell surrounded by free photons. It is considered that the
temperature depends on the mass density considering the presence of an
isothermal core. We find that the temperature produces remarkable effects on
the equilibrium and radial stability of white dwarfs. The stable equilibrium
configuration results are compared with white dwarfs estimated from the Extreme
Ultraviolet Explorer Survey and Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We derive masses,
radii, and central temperatures for the most massive white dwarfs according to
surface gravity and effective temperature reported by the survey. We note that
these massive stars are in the mass region where the general relativity effects
are important. These stars are near the threshold of instabilities due to
radial oscillations, pycnonuclear reaction, and inverse $\beta$-decay.
Regarding the radial stability of these stars as a function of the temperature,
we obtain that the radial stability decreases with the increment of central
temperature. We also obtain that the maximum mass point and the zero
eigenfrequencies of the fundamental mode are determined at the same central
energy density. Regarding low-temperature stars, the pycnonuclear reactions
occur in almost similar central energy densities, and the central energy
density threshold for inverse $\beta$-decay is not modified. For
$T_c\geq1.0\times10^{8}\,[\rm K]$, the onset of the radial instability is
attained before the pycnonuclear reaction and the inverse $\beta$-decay.

their dependence on the harmonic order. We then develop a toy model that
calculates the stable daughter loops produced from a parent loop using a
statistical approach based on a binary tree description of the loop chopping.
We also use the toy model to calculate the average number of cusps produced
from a system of loops that self intersect over their course of existence. We
derive the gravitational waveform emitted from a cusp as observed away from the
cusp, in any direction of observation. We then propagate this result in an FLRW

Langevin dynamics (RMLD)) have separately been shown to improve the performance

presenting a novel form of irreversible perturbation for RMLD that is informed

perturbations that do not take the geometry into account. Moreover we
demonstrate that irreversible perturbations generally can be implemented in
conjunction with the stochastic gradient version of the Langevin algorithm.
Lastly, while continuous-time irreversible perturbations cannot impair the
performance of a Langevin estimator, the situation can sometimes be more
complicated when discretization is considered. To this end, we describe a
discrete-time example in which irreversibility increases both the bias and

considered platform allows for strong nonlinearities between photon modes,
which are highly customisable and can be tuned in situ, i.e. during running
experiments. Our proposal hence allows for the realization of a wide range of
bosonic ansatz states, and is therefore especially useful when simulating
models involving degrees of freedom that cannot be simply mapped to qubits,
such as gauge theories, that include components which require
infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. We thus propose to experimentally apply
this bosonic VQE to the U(1) Higgs model including a topological term, which in
general introduces a sign problem in the model, making it intractable with

developing precise amortized reasoning techniques to infer the most exact
resource usage. While such innovations remain critical, we observe that fully
precise amortization is not always necessary to prove a bound of interest. And
in fact, by amortizing selectively, the needed supporting invariants can be
simpler, making the invariant inference task more feasible and predictable. We
present a framework for selectively-amortized analysis that mixes worst-case

the defect density and locations of Te inclusions, and thus a handle to assess
the quality of the material. For the classification of defects in the large

post-processed and analysed IRM data, 3D defect maps of the CdTe crystals are
created, which make different patterns of defect agglomerations inside the

grid-based hydrodynamic simulations of binary neutron star mergers. The subset
of the dynamical ejecta with velocities greater than $\sim 0.6$c can generate
an ultraviolet precursor to the kilonova on $\sim$hr timescales and contribute
to a years-long non-thermal afterglow. Previous work has found differing
amounts of this fast ejecta, by one- to two orders of magnitude, when using
particle-based or grid-based hydrodynamic methods. Here we carry out a
numerical experiment that models the merger as an axisymmetric collision in a
co-rotating frame, accounting for Newtonian self-gravity, inertial forces, and
gravitational wave losses. The lower computational cost allows us to reach
spatial resolutions as high as $4$m, or $\sim 3\times 10^{-4}$ of the stellar
radius. We find that fast ejecta production converges to within $10\%$ for a
cell size of $20$m. This suggests that fast ejecta quantities found in existing
grid-based merger simulations are unlikely to increase to the level needed to
match particle-based results upon further resolution increases. The resulting
neutron-powered precursors are in principle detectable out to distances
$\lesssim 200$Mpc with upcoming facilities. We also find that head-on
collisions at the free-fall speed, relevant for eccentric mergers, yield fast
and slow ejecta quantities of order $10^{-2}M_\odot$, with a kilonova signature
distinct from that of quasi-circular mergers.

prove that barren plateaus (i.e., exponentially vanishing gradients) prevail in
the training process of the machine learning algorithms with global loss

variational parameters near the local observables do not vanish as the system

nucleon tagging represents a unique method for extracting the free neutron
structure functions and exploring the nuclear modifications of bound protons
and neutrons. The detection of the spectator (with typical momenta $\lesssim$
100 MeV/c in the deuteron rest frame) controls the nuclear configuration during
the DIS process and enables a differential analysis of nuclear effects. At the
future electron-ion collider (EIC) such measurements will be performed using
far-forward detectors.
  Purpose: Simulate deuteron DIS with proton or neutron tagging with the
baseline EIC far-forward detector design. Quantify detector acceptance and
resolution effects. Study feasibility of free nucleon structure extraction
using pole extrapolation in the spectator momentum.
  Methods: DIS events with proton and neutron spectators are generated using
the BeAGLE Monte Carlo generator. The spectator nucleon momentum is
reconstructed including effects of detector acceptance and resolution. Pole
extrapolation is performed under realistic conditions. The free nucleon
structure extraction is validated by comparing with the input model.
  Results: Proton and neutron spectator detection is possible over the full
transverse momentum range $0 < p_T < 100$ MeV/c needed for pole extrapolation.
Resolution effects on the distributions before corrections are ~10% for proton
and ~30 for neutron spectators. The overall accuracy of nucleon structure
extraction is expected to be at the few-percent level.
  Conclusions: Free neutron structure extraction through proton tagging and
pole extrapolation is feasible with the baseline EIC far-forward detector
design. The corresponding extraction of free proton structure through neutron
tagging provides a reference point for future studies of nuclear modifications.

formation. High-resolution simulations by our group have shown that even a
modest bump can collect enough dust to trigger planetesimal formation by the
streaming instability. In this work, we probe the limits of planetesimal
formation when the external source of pressure bump reinforcement is extremely
weak. We conduct simulations of radially elongated shearing boxes to capture
the entire bump, which is generated and maintained over some timescale $t_{\rm
reinf}$ by a Newtonian relaxation scheme. We find that planetesimal formation
is extremely resilient for cm-sized grains. We reduced the strength of
reinforcement by up to a factor of 100 and the location and initial masses of
planetesimals were essentially unaffected. However, we do find that strong
reinforcement causes much faster pebble drift compared to the the standard
pebble drift rates. The resulting larger pebble flux enhances the planetesimal
growth rate by pebble accretion. We hypothesize that to sustain the bump, our
code has to extract angular momentum (the strength of this negative torque
depends on $t_{\rm reinf}$), and some of this torque is transferred to the
particles, causing them to drift faster for a stronger torque (i.e., smaller
$t_{\rm reinf}$). Since any physical process that sustains a pressure bump must
do so by torquing the gas, we conjecture that the effect on pebble drift is a
real phenomenon, motivating further work with physically realistic sources to
generate the bump.

cusps, and the number of mergers experienced. We study both the amount of
depleted stellar mass (or ``mass deficit'), $M_{\rm def}$, and the radial
extent of the depleted region, $r_{\rm b}$. We find that $r_{\rm b}\simeq

$4M_{\bullet}$, with $r_{\rm SOI}$ the influence radius of the remnant SMBH and
$M_{\bullet}$ its mass. The coefficients in these relations depend weakly on
the binary mass ratio and remain remarkably constant through subsequent
mergers. We conclude that the core size and mass deficit do not scale linearly
with the number of mergers, making it hard to infer merger histories from
observations. On the other hand, we show that both $M_{\rm def}$ and $r_{\rm

dark matter have long puzzled astronomers. One of the most recently-proposed
globular cluster formation channels ties ancient star clusters to the
large-scale streaming velocity of baryons relative to dark matter in the early
Universe. These streaming velocities affect the global infall of baryons into
dark matter halos, the high-redshift halo mass function, and the earliest
generations of stars. In some cases, streaming velocities may result in dense
regions of dark-matter-free gas that becomes Jeans unstable, potentially
leading to the formation of compact star clusters. We investigate this
hypothesis using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that include a full
chemical network and the formation and destruction of H$_2$, a process crucial
for the formation of the first stars. We find that high-density gas in regions
with significant streaming velocities -- which constitute approximately 1\% of
the Universe -- is indeed somewhat offset from the centers of dark matter
halos, but this offset is typically significantly smaller than the virial
radius. Gas outside of dark matter halos never reaches Jeans-unstable densities
in our simulations. We postulate that low-level ($Z \approx
10^{-3}\,Z_{\odot}$) metal enrichment by Population III supernovae may enable
cooling in the extra-virial regions, allowing gas outside of dark matter halos
to cool to the CMB temperature and become Jeans-unstable. Follow-up simulations
that include both streaming velocities and metal enrichment by Population III
supernovae are needed to understand if streaming velocities provide one path
for the formation of globular clusters in the early Universe.

of foliated field theories which, roughly, are built by coupling together
fields supported on the leaves of foliations of spacetime. Another approach,
which we refer to as exotic field theory, focuses on constructing Lagrangians
consistent with special symmetries (like subsystem symmetries) that are
adjacent to fracton physics. A third framework is that of infinite-component
Chern-Simons theories, which attempts to generalize the role of conventional
Chern-Simons theory in describing (2+1)D Abelian topological order to fractonic
order in (3+1)D. The study of these theories is ongoing, and many of their
properties remain to be understood.
  Historically, it has been fruitful to study QFTs by embedding them into
string theory. One way this can be done is via D-branes, extended objects whose
dynamics can, at low energies, be described in terms of conventional quantum
field theory. QFTs that can be realized in this way can then be analyzed using
the rich mathematical and physical structure of string theory. In this paper,
we show that foliated field theories, exotic field theories, and
infinite-component Chern-Simons theories can all be realized on the
world-volumes of branes. We hope that these constructions will ultimately yield
valuable insights into the physics of these interesting field theories.

outcome of giant planet formation. IPMOs offer an advantage over other directly
imaged planets in that high-contrast imaging is not necessary to detect the
photometric transit signal. For at least 30 (>50%) of the currently known
IPMOs, observations of a single transit with the James Webb Space Telescope
would have low enough forecasted noise levels to allow for the detection of an
Io-like or Titan-like moon. Intrinsic variability of the IPMOs will be an
obstacle. Using archival time-series photometry of IPMOs with the Spitzer Space
Telescope as a proof-of-concept, we found evidence for a fading event of 2MASS

consistent with a single transit of a habitable-zone 1.7$R_\oplus$ exomoon.

black holes in full-fledged Einstein-Maxwell theory cannot be overcharged past

censorship conjecture. We show that naked singularities do not form even in
Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory, although it is possible to form scalarized
black holes with charge above the Reissner-Nordstr\""om bound. We argue that
charge and mass extraction due to superradiance at fully nonlinear level is
crucial to bound the charge-to-mass ratio of the final black hole below
extremality. We also discuss some ""descalarization"" mechanisms for scalarized
black holes induced either by superradiance or by absorption of an
opposite-charged wavepacket; in all cases the final state after descalarization

asymmetric reheating of two sectors coupled solely by gravity. While the
visible sector is reheated by the inflaton or a modulus, the dark sector is
reheated by PBHs. Compared to inflationary or modular reheating of both
sectors, there are two advantages: $(i)$ inflaton or moduli mediated operators
that can subsequently thermalize the dark sector with the visible sector are
not relevant to the asymmetric reheating process; $(ii)$ the mass and abundance
of the PBHs provide parametric control of the thermal history of the dark
sector, and in particular the ratio of the temperatures of the two sectors.
Asymmetric reheating with PBHs turns out to have a particularly rich dark
sector phenomenology, which we explore using a single self-interacting real
scalar field in the dark sector as a template. Four thermal histories,
involving non-relativistic and relativistic dark matter (DM) at chemical
equilibrium, followed by the presence or absence of cannibalism, are explored.
These histories are then constrained by the observed relic abundance in the
current Universe and the Bullet Cluster. The case where PBHs dominate the
energy density of the Universe, and reheat both the visible as well as the dark
sectors, is also treated in detail.

way. For computational tractability in real large-scale settings, such plans
are typically computed by solving deterministic and cyclic formulations. An
important input is the periodic demand, i.e., the demand that is expected to
repeat in each period of the planning horizon. Motivated by the discrepancy
between time series forecasts of demand in each period and the periodic demand,
Laage et al. (2021) recently introduced the Periodic Demand Estimation (PDE)
problem and showed that it has a high value. However, they made strong
assumptions on the solution space so that the problem could be solved by
enumeration. In this paper we significantly extend their work. We propose a new
PDE formulation that relaxes the strong assumptions on the solution space. We
solve large instances of this formulation with a two-step heuristic. The first
step reduces the dimension of the feasible space by performing clustering of
commodities based on instance-specific information about demand and supply
interactions. The formulation along with the first step allow to solve the
problem in a second step by either metaheuristics or the state-of-the-art
black-box optimization solver NOMAD. In an extensive empirical study using real
data from the Canadian National Railway Company, we show that our methodology
produces high quality solutions and outperforms existing ones.

method for brain tumor quantification using EPI acquisition and deep learning
reconstruction. $\textbf{Methods}$: A CEST-MRF pulse sequence originally
designed for animal imaging was modified to conform to hardware limits on
clinical scanners while keeping scan time $\leq$ 2 minutes. Quantitative MRF
reconstruction was performed using a deep reconstruction network (DRONE) to
yield the water relaxation and chemical exchange parameters. The feasibility of
the 6 parameter DRONE reconstruction was tested in simulations in a digital
brain phantom. A healthy subject was scanned with the CEST-MRF sequence,
conventional MRF and CEST sequences for comparison. Reproducibility was
assessed via test-retest experiments and the concordance correlation
coefficient (CCC) calculated for white matter (WM) and grey matter (GM). The
clinical utility of CEST-MRF was demonstrated in 4 patients with brain
metastases in comparison to standard clinical imaging sequences. Tumors were
segmented into edema, solid core and necrotic core regions and the CEST-MRF
values compared to the contra-lateral side. $\textbf{Results}$: The DRONE
reconstruction of the digital phantom yielded a normalized RMS error of $\leq$
7% for all parameters. The CEST-MRF parameters were in good agreement with
those from conventional MRF and CEST sequences and previous studies. The mean
CCC for all 6 parameters was 0.98$\pm$0.01 in WM and 0.98$\pm$0.02 in GM. The
CEST-MRF values in nearly all tumor regions were significantly different
(P=0.05) from each other and the contra-lateral side. $\textbf{Conclusion}$:
Combination of EPI readout and deep learning reconstruction enabled fast,
accurate and reproducible CEST-MRF in brain tumors.

examined with respect to the deformation parameters of the projectile and

facts are classified into four categories and are then used to study several
unsuccessful as well as planned reactions to synthesize the new superheavy
elements $Z= 119, 120$. Concrete inference is too difficult to draw from these
results because of excessive deviations in evaporation residue cross-section
data. It is found that the arbitrary choice of excitation energy for the
experiments studied was the root cause of such large deviations. Such a complex
issue can be resolved well by theoretical excitation function studies using the
advanced statistical model or the dinuclear system model and choosing the
excitation energy corresponding to the energy where the excitation function
curve shows the maximum. We believe this method may help us to predict whether
the estimated evaporation residue cross-section can be measurable within the
experimental limit of the existing facilities for the future reactions planned.

parameters describe clump distribution in velocity-space and density of the
interclump medium in physical-space, respectively. We observe a mass-loss rate
reduction of a factor of 3.6 compared to theoretical predictions from Vink et
al. (2000), and mass-loss rates within a factor 1.4 of predictions from
Bj\""orklund et al. (2021). We confirm that including optically thick clumping
allows simultaneous fitting of recombination lines and resonance lines,

entanglement is a generic result of interaction, as shown by Gemmer and

extremely small. Because the apparatus has an enormous number of degrees of

date, none is able to preserve high image quality without either assuming a
finite number of sources for dynamic changes, assuming a thin scattering
medium, or requiring the access to both ends of the medium. In this paper, we
propose an adaptive inverse mapping (AIP) method which is flexible regarding
any dynamic change and only requires output speckle images after
initialization. We show that the inverse mapping can be corrected through
unsupervised learning if the output speckle images are followed closely. We
test the AIP method on two numerical simulations, namely, a dynamic scattering
system formulated as an evolving transmission matrix and a telescope with a
changing random phase mask at a defocus plane. Then we experimentally apply the
AIP method on a dynamic fiber-optic imaging system. Increased robustness in
imaging is observed in all three cases. With the excellent performance, we see

result is independent of the choice of de Sitter slicings. The
Glauber-Sudarshan state, constructed by shifting the interacting vacuum in the
M-theory uplift of the scenario, differs from a standard coherent state in QFT
in the sense that the shape and size of the state changes with respect to time,
implying changes in the graviton and the flux quanta. Despite this, the
expectation values of the graviton and flux operators in such a state reproduce
the exact de Sitter background, as long as we are within the temporal bound set
by the onset of the strong coupling in the dual type IIA side, and satisfy the
corresponding Schwinger-Dyson's equations in the presence of hierarchically
controlled perturbative and non-perturbative quantum corrections.

quantization conditions, along-with the constraints from the Schwinger-Dyson's

real-world applications. A recent line of research explores the power of graph
neural networks to solve combinatorial and graph algorithmic problems such as
subgraph isomorphism, detecting cliques, and the traveling salesman problem.
However, many NP-complete problems are as of yet unexplored using this method.
In this paper, we tackle the Steiner Tree Problem. We employ four learning
frameworks to compute low cost Steiner trees: feed-forward neural networks,
graph neural networks, graph convolutional networks, and a graph attention
model. We use these frameworks in two fundamentally different ways: 1) to train
the models to learn the actual Steiner tree nodes, 2) to train the model to
learn good Steiner point candidates to be connected to the constructed tree
using a shortest path in a greedy fashion. We illustrate the robustness of our
heuristics on several random graph generation models as well as the SteinLib
data library. Our finding suggests that the out-of-the-box application of GNN
methods does worse than the classic 2-approximation method. However, when
combined with a greedy shortest path construction, it even does slightly better
than the 2-approximation algorithm. This result sheds light on the fundamental
capabilities and limitations of graph learning techniques on classical
NP-complete problems.

circumvented in practical implementations of quantum information tasks. The use
of local unitaries, while not changing the initial entanglement present in a

consequently its ability to be used as a resource. This way, local unitaries
provide an easy and accessible way to enhance quantum correlations in a variety
of different experimental platforms. Given an initial entangled state and a
certain noisy channel, what are the local unitaries providing the most robust
dynamics? In this paper we solve this question considering two qubits states,
together with paradigmatic and relevant noisy channels, showing its
consequences for teleportation protocols and identifying cases where the most
robust states are not necessarily the ones imprinting the least information
about themselves into the environment. We also derive a general law relating

we study the effect of magnon interactions on the polarization of magnon modes.
We find that although the noninteracting eigenmodes in the uniaxial case are

interactions squeeze the low-energy magnon modes and make them elliptical. In

KELT-9b using the new MAROON-X spectrograph. We detect atomic lines in emission
with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 using cross-correlation with binary masks.
The detection of emission lines confirms the presence of a thermal inversion in
KELT-9b's atmosphere. We also use M-dwarf stellar masks to search for TiO,
which has recently been invoked to explain the unusual \textit{HST}/WFC3
spectrum of the planet. We find that the KELT-9b atmosphere is inconsistent
with the M-dwarf masks. Furthermore, we use an atmospheric retrieval approach
to place an upper limit on the TiO volume mixing ratio of 10$^{-8.5}$ (at 99\%
confidence). This upper limit is inconsistent with the models used to match the
WFC3 data, which require at least an order of magnitude more TiO, thus
suggesting the need for an alternate explanation of the space-based data. Our
retrieval results also strongly prefer an inverted temperature profile and
atomic/ion abundances largely consistent with the expectations for a solar
composition gas in thermochemcial equilibrium. The exception is the retrieved
abundance of Fe$^+$, which is about 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than
predictions. These results highlight the growing power of high-resolution
spectrographs on large ground-based telescopes to characterize exoplanet
atmospheres when used in combination with new retrieval techniques.

our transmission spectrum, to the following values: VMR[H2O] =
-4.4^{+0.4}_{-0.4}, and P_cloud >~ 0.2 bar (grey clouds), both of which are
consistent with previous studies of this planet. Our retrieved water volume
mixing ratio is slightly sub-solar although, combining it with the previously
retrieved super-solar CO abundances from other studies would imply super-solar
C/O ratio. We furthermore measure a net blue shift of the planet signal of
-4.62^{+0.46}_{-0.44} km s-1, which is somewhat larger than many previous

walks in dynamic random environments where the entire environment is resampled
along a fixed sequence of times, called the ""cooling sequence,"" and is kept
fixed in between those times. This model interpolates between that of a
homogenous random walk, where the environment is reset at every step, and
Random Walks in (static) Random Environments (RWRE), where the environment is
never resampled. In this work we focus on the limiting distributions of
one-dimensional RWCRE in the regime where the fluctuations of the corresponding
(static) RWRE is given by a $s$-stable random variable with $s\in(1,2)$. In
this regime, due to the two extreme cases (resampling every step and never
resampling, respectively), a crossover from Gaussian to stable limits for
sufficiently regular cooling sequence was previously conjectured. Our first
result answers affirmatively this conjecture by making clear critical exponent,
norming sequences and limiting laws associated with the crossover which
demonstrates a change from Gaussian to $s$-stable limits, passing at
criticality through a certain generalized tempered stable distribution. We then
explore the resulting RWCRE scaling limits for general cooling sequences. On
the one hand, we offer sets of operative sufficient conditions that guarantee
asymptotic emergence of either Gaussian, $s$-stable or generalized tempered
distributions from a certain class. On the other hand, we give explicit
examples and describe how to construct irregular cooling sequences for which
the corresponding limit law is characterized by mixtures of the three above
mentioned laws. To obtain these results, we need and derive a number of refined
asymptotic results for the static RWRE with $s\in(1,2)$ which may be of
independent interest.

for the first time that this proxy measure of catastrophic interference
correlates with sample efficiency across several search methods, proving that
favorable loss landscapes can be induced by the correct choice of physical
structure. We show that such structures can be found via co-optimization --
optimization of a robot's structure and control policy simultaneously --
yielding catastrophic interference resistant robot structures and policies, and
that this is more efficient than control policy optimization alone. Finally, we
show that such structures exhibit sensor homeostasis across environments and

glasses (MGs) is well documented and likely to strongly influence the
properties of glasses grown by vapor deposition. Here, we use classical
molecular dynamics simulations to identify different factors influencing the
enhancement of surface diffusion in MGs. MGs have a simple atomic structure and
belong to the category of moderately fragile glasses that undergo pronounced
slowdown of bulk dynamics with cooling close to the glass transition
temperature (Tg). We observe that DS exhibits a much more moderate slowdown
compared to DV when approaching Tg, and DS/DV at Tg varies by two orders of
magnitude among the MGs investigated. We demonstrate that both the surface
energy and the fraction of missing bonds for surface atoms show good
correlation to DS/DV, implying that the loss of nearest neighbors at the
surface directly translates into higher mobility, unlike the behavior of
network- and hydrogen-bonded organic glasses. Fragility, a measure of the
slowdown of bulk dynamics close to Tg, also correlates to DS/DV, with more
fragile systems having larger surface enhancement of mobility. The deviations
observed in the fragility and DS over DV relationship are shown to be
correlated to the extent of segregation or depletion of the mobile element at
the surface. Finally, we explore the relationship between the diffusion
pre-exponential factor (D0) and activation energy (Q) and compare to a ln(D0)-Q
correlation previously established for bulk glasses, demonstrating similar
correlations from MD as in the experiments and that the surface and bulk have
very similar ln(D0)-Q correlations.

efficient LiDAR based panoptic segmentation framework, called GP-S3Net.
GP-S3Net is a proposal-free approach in which no object proposals are needed to
identify the objects in contrast to conventional two-stage panoptic systems,
where a detection network is incorporated for capturing instance information.
Our new design consists of a novel instance-level network to process the
semantic results by constructing a graph convolutional network to identify
objects (foreground), which later on are fused with the background classes.
Through the fine-grained clusters of the foreground objects from the semantic
segmentation backbone, over-segmentation priors are generated and subsequently
processed by 3D sparse convolution to embed each cluster. Each cluster is
treated as a node in the graph and its corresponding embedding is used as its
node feature. Then a GCNN predicts whether edges exist between each cluster
pair. We utilize the instance label to generate ground truth edge labels for
each constructed graph in order to supervise the learning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GP-S3Net outperforms the current state-of-the-art
approaches, by a significant margin across available datasets such as, nuScenes
and SemanticPOSS, ranking first on the competitive public SemanticKITTI

indispensable to next-generation information and computing technologies.
Exploitation of topological band structure is an ideal starting point to
realize correlated topological QMs. Herein, we report that strain-induced
symmetry modification in correlated oxide SrNbO3 thin films creates an emerging
topological band structure. Dirac electrons in strained SrNbO3 films reveal
ultra-high mobility (100,000 cm2/Vs), exceptionally small effective mass
(0.04me), and non-zero Berry phase. More importantly, strained SrNbO3 films
reach the extreme quantum limit, exhibiting a sign of fractional occupation of
Landau levels and giant mass enhancement. Our results suggest that
symmetry-modified SrNbO3 is a rare example of a correlated topological QM, in
which strong correlation of Dirac electrons leads to the realization of
fractional occupation of Landau levels.

fillers are comprised of few-layer graphene flakes with lateral sizes in the
range from 400 nm to 1200 nm and number of atomic planes from one to ~100. The
distribution of the lateral dimensions and thicknesses of graphene fillers has
been determined via atomic force microscopy statistics. It was found that in
the examined range of the lateral dimensions the thermal conductivity of the
composites increases with the increasing size of the graphene fillers. The
observed difference in thermal properties can be related to the average gray
phonon mean free path in graphene, which has been estimated to be around ~800
nm at room temperature. The thermal contact resistance of composites with
graphene fillers of 1200-nm lateral dimensions was also smaller than that of
composites with graphene fillers of 400-nm lateral dimensions. The effects of
the filler loading fraction and the filler size on the thermal conductivity of
the composites were rationalized within the Kanari model. The obtained results
are important for optimization of graphene fillers for applications in thermal
interface materials for heat removal from high-power-density electronics.

further generalizing the concept of an opetope introduced by Baez and Dolan,
who used this for the definition of their version of non-strict $n$-categories.
Opetopes arise from iterating a certain construction on operads called the
$+$-construction, starting with monoids. The first step gives rise to plain
operads, i.e. operads without symmetries. The permutation axiom in a symmetric
operad, however, is an additional structure resulting from permutation of
variables, independent of the structure of a monoid. Even though we can apply
the $+$-construction to symmetric operads, there is the possibility of
introducing a completely different kind of permutations on the higher levels by
again permuting variables without regard to the structure on the previous
levels. Defining and investigating these structures is the main purpose of this
paper. The structures obtained in this way is what I call $n$-actads. In
$n$-actads with $n>1$, the permutations on the different levels give rise to a
certain special kind of $n$-fold category. I also explore the concept of
iterated algebras over an $n$-actad (generalizing an algebra and module over an
operad), and various types of iterated units. I give some examples of algebras
over $2$-actads, and show how they can be used to construct certain new
interesting homotopy types of operads. I also discuss a connection between
actads and ordinal notation.

Interpretable individualized treatment rules (ITRs) are desirable for
clinicians or policymakers due to their intuitive appeal and transparency. The
gold-standard approach to estimating the ITRs is randomized experiments, where
subjects are randomized to different treatment groups and the bias is minimized
to the extent possible. However, experimental data are limited in external
validity because of their selection restrictions and therefore are not
representative of the target real-world population. Conventional learning
methods of optimal interpretable ITRs for a target population based only on
experimental data are biased. On the other hand, real-world data (RWD) are
becoming popular and provide a representative sample of the population. To
learn the generalizable optimal interpretable ITRs, we propose an integrative
transfer learning method based on weighting schemes to calibrate the covariate
distribution of the experiment to that of the RWD. We show that the proposed
ITR estimator has a theoretical guarantee of the risk consistency. We evaluate
the transfer learner based on the finite-sample performance through simulation

decay, as well as fragmentation into Q-balls, which can interact by some

long-range interactions between Q-balls facilitates the growth of Q-balls until

describing the exposure-mediator relationship. The purpose of this article is
to comprehensively develop and investigate the finite-sample performance of NIE
and MP estimators via the product method. With four common data types, we
propose closed-form interval estimators via the theory of estimating equations
and multivariate delta method, and evaluate its empirical performance relative
to the bootstrap approach. In addition, we have observed that the rare outcome
assumption is frequently invoked to approximate the NIE and MP with a binary
outcome, although this approximation may lead to non-negligible bias when the
outcome is common. We therefore introduce the exact expressions for NIE and MP
with a binary outcome without the rare outcome assumption and compare its
performance with the approximate estimators. Based upon these theoretical
developments and empirical studies, we offer several practical recommendations
to inform practice. An R package mediateP is developed to implement the methods

quantum signals. This problem is exacerbated in the context of Low Earth Orbit

be less than a few minutes. A potential solution to this problem is massive
parallelisation of the classical reconciliation process in which a large-code
block is subdivided into many shorter blocks for individual decoding. However,
the penalty of this procedure on the important final secured key rate is
non-trivial to determine and hitherto has not been formally analysed. Ideally,
a determination of the optimal reduced block size, maximising the final key
rate, would be forthcoming in such an analysis. In this work, we fill this
important knowledge gap via detailed analyses and experimental verification of
a CV-QKD sliced reconciliation protocol that uses large block-length
low-density parity-check decoders. Our new solution results in a significant
increase in the final key rate relative to non-optimised reconciliation. In
addition, it allows for the acquisition of quantum secured messages between
terrestrial stations and LEO satellites within a flyover timescale even using
off-the-shelf processors. Our work points the way to optimised global quantum

in excellent agreement. Furthermore, the PS-SBFEM with quadtree meshes shows a
good effect for solving complex geometric in the seepage problem. Hence, the

we propose an FL framework to jointly consider performance consistency and
algorithmic fairness across different local clients (data sources). We derive
our framework from a constrained multi-objective optimization perspective, in

consistent performance. Specifically, we treat the algorithm prediction loss at
each local client as an objective and maximize the worst-performing client with
fairness constraints through optimizing a surrogate maximum function with all
objectives involved. A gradient-based procedure is employed to achieve the
Pareto optimality of this optimization problem. Theoretical analysis is
provided to prove that our method can converge to a Pareto solution that
achieves the min-max performance with fairness constraints on all clients.
Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
superiority that our approach over baselines and its effectiveness in achieving

fact, an ideal quantum cryptographic key, built with the sharing of maximally

uncorrelated symbols mathematically described by a perfect white noise, a
stochastic process with zero mean and without correlation between its values
taken at different times. Gravitational field perturbations, including quantum
gravity fluctuations and gravitational waves, introduce additional phase terms

synthetic stellar populations, we estimate a helium spread of
$\Delta{Y}\sim0.01\pm0.01$ among the main-sequence stars in NGC 1846. The
maximum helium spread would not exceed $\Delta{Y}\sim0.02$, depending on the
adopted fraction of helium-enriched stars. To mask the color variation caused
by such a helium enrichment, a nitrogen enrichment of at least $\Delta{\rm

red-giant branch in this cluster. We find that our result is consistent with
the $\Delta{Y}$--mass relationship for Galactic globular clusters. To examine

rapid and accessible design and fabrication of elegant designs and complex
functionalities through cutting and folding of flexible 2D sheets or even
strings, i.e.printable manufacturing. Yet, origami robots still require bulky,
rigid components or electronics for actuation and control to accomplish tasks
with reliability, programmability, ability to output substantial force, and
durability, restricting their full potential. Here, we present a printable
self-sustained compliant oscillator that generates periodic actuation using
only constant electrical power, without discrete components or electronic
control hardware. This oscillator is robust (9 out of 10 prototypes worked
successfully on the first try), configurable (with tunable periods from 3 s to
12 s), powerful (can overcome hydrodynamic resistance to consistently propel a
swimmer at ~1.6 body lengths/min), and long-lasting (~10^3 cycles); it enables
driving macroscale devices with prescribed autonomous behaviors, e.g.
locomotion and sequencing. This oscillator is also fully functional underwater
and in high magnetic fields. Our analytical model characterizes essential
parameters of the oscillation period, enabling programmable design of the
oscillator. The printable oscillator can be integrated into origami-inspired
systems seamlessly and monolithically, allowing rapid design and prototyping;
the resulting integrated devices are lightweight, low-cost, compliant,
electronic-free, and nonmagnetic, enabling practical applications in extreme
areas. We demonstrate the functionalities of the oscillator with: (i)
autonomous gliding of a printable swimmer, (ii) LED flashing, and (iii) fluid
stirring. This work paves the way for realizing fully printable autonomous
robots with a high integration of actuation and control.

Surveillance project detected a distinct population of smaller meteors
belonging to the irregular IAU shower #628, the s-Taurids. While this returning
outburst was predicted and observed in previous work, the reason for this
stream is not yet understood. 2015 was the first year that the stream was
precisely observed, providing an opportunity to better understand its nature.
We analyse the orbital elements of stream members, and establish a size
frequency distribution from millimetre to metre size range.
  The stream is highly stratified with a large change of entry speed along
Earth's orbit. We confirm that the meteoroids have orbital periods near the 7:2
mean-motion resonance with Jupiter. The mass distribution of this population is
dominated by larger meteoroids, unlike that for the regular Southern Taurid
shower. The distribution index is consistent with a gentle collisional
fragmentation of weak material.
  A population of metre-sized objects is identified from satellite observations
at a rate consistent with a continuation of the size-frequency distribution
established at centimetre size. The observed change of longitude of perihelion
among the s-Taurids points to recent (a few centuries ago) activity from
fragmentation involving surviving asteroid 2015TX24. This supports a model for
the Taurid Complex showers that involves an ongoing fragmentation cascade of
comet 2P/Encke siblings following a breakup some 20,000 years ago.

the fractional edge state of the topological odd-spin Haldane phases. Despite

nonzero magnetization plateaus can also have the quantized edge magnetization
that deviates from the magnetization density in bulk. We demonstrate that the
quantized edge magnetization distinguishes two quantum phases on a
magnetization plateau separated by a quantum critical point. The edge
magnetization exhibits an abrupt stepwise change from zero to $1/2$ at the
quantum critical point because the quantum phase transition occurs in the

sensitive resources. This control of access is important as there is now a need
for collaborative resource sharing between multiple organizations over open
environments like the internet. Although there are multiple access control
models that are being widely used, these models are providing access control
within a closed environment i.e. within the organization using it. These models
have restricted capabilities in providing access control in open environments.
Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) has emerged as a powerful access control
model to bring fine-grained authorization to organizations that possess
sensitive data and resources and want to collaborate over open environments. In
an ABAC system, access to resources that an organization possess can be
controlled by applying policies on attributes of the users. These policies are
conditions that need to be satisfied by the requester in order to gain access
to the resource. In this paper, we provide an introduction to ABAC and by
carrying forward the architecture of ABAC, we propose a Decentralized Policy
Information Point (PIP) model. Our model proposes the decentralization of PIP,
which is an entity of the ABAC model that allows the storage and query of user
attributes and enforces fine-grained access control for controlling the access
of sensitive resources over multiple domains. Our model makes use of the
concept of a cryptographic primitive called Attribute-Based Signature (ABS) to
keep the identities of the users involved, private. Our model can be used for
collaborative resource sharing over the internet. The evaluation of our model
is also discussed to reflect the application of the proposed decentralized PIP
model.

currently be reliably and effectively defended without extensive reliance on
human experts. Skilled cyber defenders are in short supply and often cannot
respond fast enough to cyber threats.
  Building on recent advances in AI and ML the Cyber defense research community
has been motivated to develop new dynamic and sustainable defenses through the
adoption of AI and ML techniques to both cyber and non-cyber settings. Bridging
critical gaps between AI and Cyber researchers and practitioners can accelerate
efforts to create semi-autonomous cyber defenses that can learn to recognize
and respond to cyber attacks or discover and mitigate weaknesses in cooperation
with other cyber operation systems and human experts. Furthermore, these
defenses are expected to be adaptive and able to evolve over time to thwart
changes in attacker behavior, changes in the system health and readiness, and
natural shifts in user behavior over time.
  The Workshop (held on August 19th and 20th 2021 in Montreal-themed virtual
reality) was comprised of technical presentations and a panel discussion
focused on open problems and potential research solutions. Workshop submissions
were peer reviewed by a panel of domain experts with a proceedings consisting
of 10 technical articles exploring challenging problems of critical importance
to national and global security. Participation in this workshop offered new

3D position features for query points, which provides stronger 3D space context
for the distance function. Furthermore, in order to obtain more accurate point
projection direction at inference, we explicitly align the spatial gradient

intensity mapping survey SKA1-MID-B1 and optical galaxy survey Euclid also
reach the order $\mathcal{O}$(-8). The fourth-generation CMB experiments SO and
CORE produces the order $\mathcal{O}$(-6), while large scale structure surveys
Euclid weak lensing, Euclid galaxy clustering and CSST weak lensing obtain the
order $\mathcal{O}$(-5). Interestingly, CSST galaxy clustering gives the same

photoionized and molecular gas near hot (O) stars or reflection nebulae
illuminated by somewhat cooler (B) stars. In these environments, the dominant
excitation mechanism for NIR emission lines originating from excited
rotational-vibrational (rovibrational) levels of the ground electronic state is
radiative or UV excitation (fluorescence), wherein absorption of far-UV photons
pumps H$_2$ molecules into excited electronic states from which they decay into
the upper levels of the NIR lines. Our sources span a range of UV radiation
fields ($G_0 = 10^2$-$10^5$) and gas densities ($n_H = 10^4$-$10^6$ cm$^{-3}$),

detecting up to over 170 transitions per source from excited vibrational states

these data clearly confirm UV excitation. Among the five PDRs in our survey,
the Orion Bar shows the greatest deviation of the populations and spectrum from
pure UV excitation, while Sharpless 140 shows the least deviation. However, we
find that all five PDRs exhibit at least some modification of the level
populations relative to their values under pure UV excitation, a result we
attribute to collisional effects.

off-peak times (i.e., {\it placement phase}), such that the number of
transmissions during the peak-traffic times (i.e., {\it delivery phase}) are
reduced. A coded caching strategy was originally proposed by Maddah-Ali and
Niesen (MN) leading to a multicasting gain compared to the conventional uncoded
caching, where each message in the delivery phase is useful to multiple users
simultaneously. However, the MN coded caching scheme suffers from the high
subpacketization which makes it impractical. In order to reduce the
subpacketization while retain the multicast opportunities in the delivery
phase, Yan et al. proposed a combinatorial structure called placement delivery
array (PDA) to design coded caching schemes. In this paper, we propose two
novel frameworks for constructing PDA via Cartesian product, which constructs a
PDA for $mK_1$ users by the $m$-fold Cartesian product of a PDA for $K_1$
users. By applying the proposed frameworks to some existing PDAs, three novel
caching schemes are obtained which can significantly reduce the
subpacketization of the MN scheme while slightly increasing the needed number
of transmissions. For instance, for the third scheme which works for any number
of users and any memory regime, while reducing the coded caching gain by one,
the needed subpacketization is at most
$O\left(\sqrt{\frac{K}{q}}2^{-\frac{K}{q}}\right)$ of that of the MN scheme,
where $K$ is the number of users, $0<z/q<1$ is the memory ratio of each user,

out-of-distribution detection, and motivates a new perspective on data
augmentation designed by re-combing the phase spectrum of the current image and
the amplitude spectrum of the distracter image. That is, the generated samples
force the CNN to pay more attention to the structured information from phase
components and keep robust to the variation of the amplitude. Experiments on
several image datasets indicate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performances on multiple generalizations and calibration
tasks, including adaptability for common corruptions and surface variations,
out-of-distribution detection, and adversarial attack.

the eigenvalues of an $n$-qubit Pauli channel to $\pm\varepsilon$ precision. We
give an estimation protocol with an $n$-qubit ancilla that succeeds with high
probability using only $O(n/\varepsilon^{2})$ copies of the Pauli channel,
while prove that any ancilla-free protocol (possibly with adaptive control and
channel concatenation) would need at least $\Omega(2^{n/3})$ rounds of
measurement. We further study the advantages provided by a small number of
ancillas. For the case that a $k$-qubit ancilla ($k\le n$) is available, we
obtain a sample complexity lower bound of $\Omega(2^{(n-k)/3})$ for any
non-concatenating protocol, and a stronger lower bound of $\Omega(n2^{n-k})$
for any non-adaptive, non-concatenating protocol, which is shown to be tight.
We also show how to apply the ancilla-assisted estimation protocol to a
practical quantum benchmarking task in a noise-resilient and sample-efficient
manner, given reasonable noise assumptions. Our results provide a
practically-interesting example for quantum advantages in learning and also
bring new insight for quantum benchmarking.

size on Earth is limited by the Rhines scale, which depends on the planetary
vorticity gradient, $\beta$. This study aims to examine how the Rhines scale
limits the size of an individual tropical cyclone. The traditional Rhines scale
is first re-expressed as a vortex Rhines scale and Rhines speed to characterize
how wave effects vary with radius in a vortex whose wind profile is known.
Experiments are performed using a simple barotropic model on a $\beta$-plane
initialized with a TC-like axisymmetric vortex defined using a
recently-developed theoretical model for the tropical cyclone wind profile.
$\beta$ and initial vortex size are each systematically varied to investigate
the detailed responses of the TC-like vortex to $\beta$. Results show that the
vortex shrinks towards an equilibrium size that closely follows the vortex
Rhines scale. Physically, this scale divides the vortex into a vortex-dominant
region at small radii, where the axisymmetric circulation is steady, and a
wave-dominant region at larger radii, where the circulation stimulates Rossby
waves and dissipates. A larger initial vortex relative to its vortex Rhines
scale will shrink faster, and the shrinking timescale is well described by the
vortex Rhines timescale, which is defined as the overturning timescale of the
circulation at the vortex Rhines scale and is shown to be directly related to
the Rossby wave group velocity. The relationship between our idealized results
and the real Earth is discussed.

some significant limitations that prevent it from achieving full efficiency.
First, the iterative procedure should be repeated whenever the specified target
distribution changes. Target distribution optimization can be performed to
clarify the ambiguity in specifying this distribution, but several additional
problems arise in this process such as loss of the representation capacity due
to parameterization of the distribution, excessive constraints for a realistic
distribution, inaccuracy of quantities of interest due to theoretical/empirical
predictions, and the impossibility of explicitly imposing geometric
constraints. To deal with these issues, a novel inverse design optimization
framework with a two-step deep learning approach is proposed. A variational
autoencoder and multi-layer perceptron are used to generate a realistic target
distribution and predict the quantities of interest and shape parameters from
the generated distribution, respectively. Then, target distribution
optimization is performed as the inverse design optimization. The proposed
framework applies active learning and transfer learning techniques to improve

powerful AGN, such as radio galaxies and flat-spectrum radio quasars. Recently,
a group of intriguing jetted NLS1s was discovered: based on high radio
frequency data they host relativistic jets, but in the JVLA observations they
all showed steep radio spectra at least up to 9.0~GHz, indicating very strong
absorption at these frequencies. In this paper we study a subset of these
sources in detail by employing spatially resolved radio spectral index maps at

cross-validation of methods, as well as an interpretation of the complex events
leading to the eruption. To the first objective, we find (i) strong agreement

connectivity-based and finite-volume methods, (iii) an excellent agreement

helicity budget, and that a right-handed structure erupted from a predominantly
left-handed corona during the X-class flare. Overall, we find that the use of
different methods to estimate the (accumulated) coronal helicity may be

carry out a two-loop renormalization group (RG) analysis for 2D Dirac fermion

distance, to its terminal velocity. The energy balance associated with this
acceleration remains poorly understood. To quantify the global electrostatic
contribution to the solar wind dynamics, we empirically estimate the ambipolar
electric field ($\mathrm{E}_\parallel$) and potential
($\Phi_\mathrm{r,\infty}$). We analyse electron velocity distribution functions
(VDFs) measured in the near-Sun solar wind, between 20.3\,$R_S$ and
85.3\,$R_S$, by the Parker Solar Probe. We test the predictions of two
different solar wind models. Close to the Sun, the VDFs exhibit a suprathermal
electron deficit in the sunward, magnetic field aligned part of phase space. We
argue that the sunward deficit is a remnant of the electron cutoff predicted by
collisionless exospheric models (Lemaire & Sherer 1970, 1971, Jockers 1970).
This cutoff energy is directly linked to $\Phi_\mathrm{r,\infty}$. Competing
effects of $\mathrm{E}_\parallel$ and Coulomb collisions in the solar wind are
addressed by the Steady Electron Runaway Model (SERM) (Scudder 2019). In this
model, electron phase space is separated into collisionally overdamped and
underdamped regions. We assume that this boundary velocity at small pitch
angles coincides with the strahl break-point energy, which allows us to
calculate $\mathrm{E}_\parallel$. The obtained $\Phi_\mathrm{r,\infty}$ and
$\mathrm{E}_\parallel$ agree well with theoretical expectations. They decrease
with radial distance as power law functions with indices $\alpha_\Phi = -0.66$
and $\alpha_\mathrm{E} = -1.69$. We finally estimate the velocity gained by
protons from electrostatic acceleration, which equals to 77\% calculated from
the exospheric models, and to 44\% from the SERM model.

prebiotic chemistry -- has been detected in star-forming regions and in the
comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. These studies have revealed that, in the
interstellar medium, PO is systematically the most abundant P-bearing species,
with abundances that are $\sim$1-3 times greater than those derived for
phosphorus nitride (PN), the second most abundant P-containing molecule. The
reason why PO is more abundant than PN remains still unclear. Experimental
studies with phosphorus in the gas phase are not available, probably because of
the difficulties in dealing with its compounds. Therefore, the reactivity of
atomic phosphorus needs to be investigated using reliable computational tools.
To this end, state-of-the-art quantum-chemical computations have been employed
to evaluate accurate reaction rates and branching ratios for the P + OH
$\rightarrow$ PO + H and P + H$_2$O $\rightarrow$ PO + H$_2$ reactions in the
framework of a master equation approach based on ab-initio transition state
theory. The hypothesis that OH and H${_2}$O can be potential oxidizing agents
of atomic phosphorus is based on the ubiquitous presence of H${_2}$O in the
ISM. Its destruction then produces OH, which is another very abundant species.
While the reaction of atomic phosphorus in its gound state with water is not a
relevant source of PO because of emerged energy barriers, the P + OH reaction
represents an important formation route of PO in the interstellar medium. Our
kinetic results show that this reaction follow an Arrhenius behavior, and thus
its rate coefficients alpha=2.28$\times$10$^{-10}$ cm${^3}$ molecule$^{-1}$
s$^{-1}$, beta=0.16 and gamma=0.37 K increase by increasing the temperature.

neural networks are well known to be compressed on devices that have resource
constraints. Most existing network pruning methods require laborious human
efforts and prohibitive computation resources, especially when the constraints
are changed. This practically limits the application of model compression when
the model needs to be deployed on a wide range of devices. Besides, existing
methods are still challenged by the missing theoretical guidance. In this paper
we propose an information theory-inspired strategy for automatic model
compression. The principle behind our method is the information bottleneck
theory, i.e., the hidden representation should compress information with each
other. We thus introduce the normalized Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion
(nHSIC) on network activations as a stable and generalized indicator of layer
importance. When a certain resource constraint is given, we integrate the HSIC
indicator with the constraint to transform the architecture search problem into
a linear programming problem with quadratic constraints. Such a problem is
easily solved by a convex optimization method with a few seconds. We also
provide a rigorous proof to reveal that optimizing the normalized HSIC
simultaneously minimizes the mutual information between different layers.
Without any search process, our method achieves better compression tradeoffs
comparing to the state-of-the-art compression algorithms. For instance, with
ResNet-50, we achieve a 45.3%-FLOPs reduction, with a 75.75 top-1 accuracy on

source of supervision. Since user interactions come with bias, an important
focus of research in this field lies in developing methods to correct for the
bias of interactions. Inverse propensity scoring (IPS) is a popular method
suitable for correcting position bias. Affine correction (AC) is a
generalization of IPS that corrects for position bias and trust bias. IPS and
AC provably remove bias, conditioned on an accurate estimation of the bias
parameters. Estimating the bias parameters, in turn, requires an accurate
estimation of the relevance probabilities. This cyclic dependency introduces
practical limitations in terms of sensitivity, convergence and efficiency.
  We propose a new correction method for position and trust bias in CLTR in
which, unlike the existing methods, the correction does not rely on relevance
estimation. Our proposed method, mixture-based correction (MBC), is based on
the assumption that the distribution of the CTRs over the items being ranked is
a mixture of two distributions: the distribution of CTRs for relevant items and
the distribution of CTRs for non-relevant items. We prove that our method is
unbiased. The validity of our proof is not conditioned on accurate bias
parameter estimation. Our experiments show that MBC, when used in different
bias settings and accompanied by different LTR algorithms, outperforms AC, the
state-of-the-art method for correcting position and trust bias, in some
settings, while performing on par in other settings. Furthermore, MBC is orders
of magnitude more efficient than AC in terms of the training time.

  Expansion with Multiscale Uncertainties",,,,,"cs.DC math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Modern electric power systems have witnessed rapidly increasing penetration
of renewable energy, storage, electrical vehicles and various demand response
resources. The electric infrastructure planning is thus facing more challenges
due to the variability and uncertainties arising from the diverse new
resources. This study aims to develop a multistage and multiscale stochastic
mixed integer programming (MM-SMIP) model to capture both the
coarse-temporal-scale uncertainties, such as investment cost and long-run
demand stochasticity, and fine-temporal-scale uncertainties, such as hourly
renewable energy output and electricity demand uncertainties, for the power
system capacity expansion problem. To be applied to a real power system, the
resulting model will lead to extremely large-scale mixed integer programming
problems, which suffer not only the well-known curse of dimensionality, but
also computational difficulties with a vast number of integer variables at each
stage. In addressing such challenges associated with the MM-SMIP model, we
propose a nested cross decomposition algorithm that consists of two layers of
decomposition, that is, the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition and L-shaped
decomposition. The algorithm exhibits promising computational performance under
our numerical study, and is especially amenable to parallel computing, which
will also be demonstrated through the computational results.

liquid-crystalline mesogens, e.g., to electric fields, and the (visco)elastic
properties of a polymer network. Because of this, these materials have been put
forward for a wide array of applications, including responsive surfaces such as
artificial skins and membranes. For such applications, the desired functional
response must generally be realized under strict geometrical constraints, such
as provided by supported thin films. To model such settings, we present a
dynamical, spatially-heterogeneous Landau-type theory for electrically-actuated
liquid crystal network films. We find that the response of the liquid crystal
network permeates the film from top to bottom, and illustrate how this affects
the time scale associated with macroscopic deformation. Finally, by linking our
model parameters to experimental quantities, we suggest that the permeation
rate can be controlled by varying the aspect ratio of the mesogens and their
degree of orientational order when cross-linked into the polymer network, for
which we predict a single optimum. Our results contribute specifically to the
rational design of future applications involving transport or on-demand release
of molecular cargo in liquid crystal network films.

homogeneous bodies and of zero orbital inclination. We conducted coupled
thermal--orbital evolution simulations using the Andrade viscoelastic model and
included higher-order eccentricity functions. The distribution of the final
eccentricity from a large number of simulations with different initial
conditions revealed that the radius of Xiangliu is not larger than 100 km. We
also derived the analytical solution of the semilatus rectum evolution, a

rely on either scale-invariant, translation-invariant, or rotation-invariant
operations, such as max-pooling. However, the adoption of such procedures does
not necessarily improve viewpoint generalization, rather leading to more
data-dependent methods. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel capsule
autoencoder network with fast Variational Bayes capsule routing, named DECA. By
modeling each joint as a capsule entity, combined with the routing algorithm,
our approach can preserve the joints' hierarchical and geometrical structure in
the feature space, independently from the viewpoint. By achieving viewpoint
equivariance, we drastically reduce the network data dependency at training
time, resulting in an improved ability to generalize for unseen viewpoints. In
the experimental validation, we outperform other methods on depth images from
both seen and unseen viewpoints, both top-view, and front-view. In the RGB

in the research community recently. Simultaneously, the number of parameters of
state-of-the-art deep learning models has been growing massively, with
implications on the memory and computational resources required to train and
deploy such models. One approach to control the size of neural networks is
retrospectively reducing the number of parameters, so-called neural network
pruning. Available research on the impact of neural network pruning on the
adversarial robustness is fragmentary and often does not adhere to established
principles of robustness evaluation. We close this gap by evaluating the
robustness of pruned models against L-0, L-2 and L-infinity attacks for a wide
range of attack strengths, several architectures, data sets, pruning methods,
and compression rates. Our results confirm that neural network pruning and
adversarial robustness are not mutually exclusive. Instead, sweet spots can be

Furthermore, we extend our analysis to situations that incorporate additional
assumptions on the adversarial scenario and show that depending on the

DQPM description of quarks and gluons is based on partonic propagators with
complex selfenergies where the real part of the selfenergies is related to the
quasiparticle mass and the imaginary part to a finite width of their spectral
functions. In DQPM the determination of complex selfenergies for the partonic
degrees of freedom at zero and finite $\mu_B$ has been performed by adjusting
the entropy density to the lQCD data. The temperature-dependent effective
coupling (squared) $g^2(T/T_c)$, as well as the parton effective masses and
widths are based on this adjustment. The novel extended dynamical quasiparticle
model, named ""DQPM-CP"", makes it possible to describe thermodynamical and
transport properties of quarks and gluons in a wide range of $T$ and $\mu_B$,
and reproduces the equation-of-state (EoS) of lQCD calculations in the
crossover region of finite $T, \mu_B$. We apply a scaling ansatz for the strong

trajectories of the QGP matter are compared for these two cases. The phase
diagram of DQPM-CP is close to PNJL calculations. The leading order pQCD

sensitive to the choice of boundary layer parametrisation scheme used in each
model simulation, and not to the convection parametrisation as might have been
expected. The fractal dimension is independent of cloud area distributions,
providing a complementary metric to assess the multi-scale structure of
convection and convective organisation in model simulations.

understanding of its fundamental aspects to its promising practical utility as
an integral component of hybrid systems. Nanomechanical resonators'
indispensable role as transducers between optical and microwave fields in
hybrid systems, such as quantum communications interface, have elevated their
importance in recent years. It is therefore crucial to determine which among
the family of nanomechanical resonators is more suitable for this role. Most of
the studies revolve around nanomechanical resonators of ultrathin structures
because of their inherently large mechanical amplitude due to their very low
mass. Here, we argue that the underutilized nanomechanical resonators made from
multilayered two-dimensional (2D) materials are the better fit for this role
because of their comparable electrostatic tunability and larger optomechanical
responsivity. To show this, we first demonstrate the electrostatic tunability
of mechanical modes of a multilayered nanomechanical resonator made from
graphite. We also show that the optomechanical responsivity of multilayered
devices will always be superior as compared to the few-layer devices. Finally,
by using the multilayered model and comparing this device with the reported
ones, we find that the electrostatic tunability of devices of intermediate
thickness is not significantly lower than that of ultrathin ones. Together with
the practicality in terms of fabrication ease and design predictability, we
contend that multilayered 2D nanomechanical resonators are the optimal choice
for the electromagnetic interface in integrated quantum systems.

performance on outdoor datasets. Its performance however degrades notably in
indoor environments because of the lack of textures. Without rich textures, the
photometric consistency is too weak to train a good depth network. Inspired by
the early works on indoor modeling, we leverage the structural regularities
exhibited in indoor scenes, to train a better depth network. Specifically, we
adopt two extra supervisory signals for self-supervised training: 1) the
Manhattan normal constraint and 2) the co-planar constraint. The Manhattan
normal constraint enforces the major surfaces (the floor, ceiling, and walls)
to be aligned with dominant directions. The co-planar constraint states that
the 3D points be well fitted by a plane if they are located within the same
planar region. To generate the supervisory signals, we adopt two components to
classify the major surface normal into dominant directions and detect the
planar regions on the fly during training. As the predicted depth becomes more
accurate after more training epochs, the supervisory signals also improve and
in turn feedback to obtain a better depth model. Through extensive experiments
on indoor benchmark datasets, the results show that our network outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at

Galactic plane, where confusion is rare, must be very faint if they have not
been identified so far. Guided by the H$\alpha$ emission of G107.0+9.0, we
separated its radio emission from the Galactic large-scale emission. Radio
emission from SNR G107.0+9.0 is detected between 22~MHz and 4.8~GHz with a
steep non-thermal spectrum, which confirms G107.0+9.0 as an SNR. Its surface
brightness is among the lowest known for Galactic SNRs. Polarised emission is
clearly detected at 1.4~GHz but is fainter at 4.8~GHz. We interpret the
polarised emission as being caused by a Faraday screen associated with
G107.0+9.0 and its surroundings. Its ordered magnetic field along the line of
sight is below 1~$\mu$G. At 4.8~GHz, we identified a depolarised filament along
the western periphery of G107.0+9.0 with a magnetic field strength along the
line of sight $B{_{||}} \sim 15~\mu$G, which requires magnetic field
compression. G107.0+9.0 adds to the currently small number of known, evolved,

objects can be successfully extracted from radio-continuum surveys despite the

hole polarons localised at the two oxygens next to the vacancy. Upon Li
insertion or injection of an extra electron into Ni-deficient NiO, one hole
gets filled, and the hole bipolaron is converted into a hole polaron
well-localized at one O atom. Furthermore, the calculated absorption
coefficients demonstrate that Li insertion/extraction or rather the
addition/removal of an extra electron into Ni-deficient NiO can lead to
switching between the oxidized (colored) and the reduced (bleached) states.

web PKI) that gives trust flexibility to both clients and domain owners, and
enables certification authorities (CAs) to enforce stronger security measures.
In today's web PKI, all CAs are equally trusted, and security is defined by the
weakest link. We address this problem by introducing trust flexibility in two
dimensions: with F-PKI, each domain owner can define a domain policy
(specifying, for example, which CAs are authorized to issue certificates for
their domain name) and each client can set or choose a validation policy based
on trust levels. F-PKI thus supports a property that is sorely needed in
today's Internet: trust heterogeneity. Different parties can express different
trust preferences while still being able to verify all certificates. In
contrast, today's web PKI only allows clients to fully distrust
suspicious/misbehaving CAs, which is likely to cause collateral damage in the
form of legitimate certificates being rejected. Our contribution is to present
a system that is backward compatible, provides sensible security properties to
both clients and domain owners, ensures the verifiability of all certificates,
and prevents downgrade attacks. Furthermore, F-PKI provides a ground for
innovation, as it gives CAs an incentive to deploy new security measures to
attract more customers, without having these measures undercut by vulnerable
CAs.

However, they do not capitalise on the high-level and semantic relationships

ways: (1) we embed a scene graph into a global context clue, serving as the
scene-specific environmental context; and (2) we build a relation-aware
message-passing module to gather relationships from objects' neighborhood and
transfer them into interactions. Empirical evaluation shows that our SG2HOI

how well we can fuse the input images in their feature space, where we wish to
remove the factors leading to low-quality image generation while performing the
fundamental computations for HDR image generation, e.g., selecting the
best-exposed image/region. We propose a novel method that can better fuse the
features based on two ideas. One is multi-step feature fusion; our network
gradually fuses the features in a stack of blocks having the same structure.
The other is the design of the component block that effectively performs two
operations essential to the problem, i.e., comparing and selecting appropriate

microseisms from sources, including the deep ocean regions, and primary
microseisms where the swells impinge on submarine topographic features. A
better understanding of the varying microseism wavefield enables improvements
to seismic imaging and development of proxy observables to complement sparse in
situ wave observations and hindcast models of the global ocean wave climate. We
analyze 12-26 years of seismic data from 11 seismic stations either on the East
Antarctic coast or sited in the Indian Ocean, Australia, and New Zealand. The
power spectral density of the seismic wavefield is calculated to explore how
the time-changing microseism intensity varies with (i) sea ice coverage
surrounding Antarctica and (ii) the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) climate index.
Variations in sea ice extent are found to be the dominant control on the
microseism intensity at Antarctic stations, which exhibit a seasonal pattern
phase-shifted by 4-5 months compared to stations in other continents. Peaks in
extremal intensity at East Antarctic stations occur in March-April, with the
highest peaks for secondary microseisms occurring during negative SAM events.
This relationship between microseism intensity and the SAM index is opposite to
that observed on the Antarctic Peninsula. This work informs the complexity of
microseism amplitudes in the Southern Hemisphere and assists ongoing
interdisciplinary investigations of interannual variability and long-term
trends.

stations presents a challenge due to the need to separate this signal from the
tectonic plate rotation. A pressing example is the observation of glacial
isostatic adjustment (GIA) which constrains the Earth's response to ice
unloading, and hence, contributions of ice-covered regions such as Antarctica
to global sea level rise following ice mass loss. We focus on horizontal GPS
velocities which typically contain a large component of plate rotation and a
smaller local component primarily relating to GIA. Incomplete separation of
these components introduces significant bias into estimates of GIA motion
vectors. We present the results of a series of tests based on the motions of
GPS stations from East Antarctica: 1) signal separation for sets of synthetic
data that replicate the geometric character of non-separable, and separable,
GIA-like horizontal velocities; and 2) signal separation for real GPS station
data with an appraisal of uncertainties. For both synthetic and real motions,
we compare results where the stations are unweighted, and where each station is
areal-weighted using a metric representing the inverse of the spatial density
of neighbouring stations. From the synthetic tests, we show that a GIA-like
signal is recoverable from the plate rotation signal providing it has geometric
variability across East Antarctica. We also show that areal-weighting has a
very significant effect on the ability to recover a GIA-like signal with
geometric variability, and hence on separating the plate rotation and local
components. For the real data, assuming a rigid Antarctic plate, fitted plate
rotation parameters compare well with other studies in the literature. We find
that 25 out of 36 GPS stations examined in East Antarctica have non-zero local
horizontal velocities, at the 2$\sigma$ level, after signal separation.

method has shown promising results especially in the 3D shape reconstruction
and compression domain. In this paper, we consider the degeneration problem of
reconstruction coming from the capacity decrease of the DeepSDF model, which
approximates the SDF with a neural network and a single latent code. We propose
Local Geometry Code Learning (LGCL), a model that improves the original DeepSDF
results by learning from a local shape geometry of the full 3D shape. We add an
extra graph neural network to split the single transmittable latent code into a
set of local latent codes distributed on the 3D shape. Mentioned latent codes
are used to approximate the SDF in their local regions, which will alleviate
the complexity of the approximation compared to the original DeepSDF.
Furthermore, we introduce a new geometric loss function to facilitate the
training of these local latent codes. Note that other local shape adjusting
methods use the 3D voxel representation, which in turn is a problem highly
difficult to solve or even is insolvable. In contrast, our architecture is
based on graph processing implicitly and performs the learning regression
process directly in the latent code space, thus make the proposed architecture
more flexible and also simple for realization. Our experiments on 3D shape
reconstruction demonstrate that our LGCL method can keep more details with a
significantly smaller size of the SDF decoder and outperforms considerably the
original DeepSDF method under the most important quantitative metrics.

To these ends, we propose a novel domain generalization framework where feature
statistics are utilized for stylizing original features to ones with novel
domain properties. To preserve class information during stylization, we first
decompose features into high and low frequency components. Afterward, we
stylize the low frequency components with the novel domain styles sampled from
the manipulated statistics, while preserving the shape cues in high frequency
ones. As the final step, we re-merge both components to synthesize novel domain
features. To enhance domain robustness, we utilize the stylized features to
maintain the model consistency in terms of features as well as outputs. We
achieve the feature consistency with the proposed domain-aware supervised

start from a Boolean model with a given classification of the state space into
phenotypes defined by high-level readout components. In order to link molecular
biomarkers with experimental design, we search for alternative components

regulatory networks for suggesting experiments and measurements based on their

provides functionality to: (1) download and/or pre-process seismic waveform
data; (2) detect and catalogue seismic events using multi-component signals
from one or more seismometers; and (3) calculate characteristics
('attributes'/'features') of the identified events. The workflow is controlled
by three main functions that have been tested for the breadth of data types
expected from permanent and campaign-deployed seismic instrumentation. A
selected STA/LTA-type (short-term average/long-term average), or other, event
detection algorithm can be applied to the waveforms and user-defined functions
implemented to calculate any required characteristics of the detected events.
The code is written in Python 2/3 and is available on GitHub together with
detailed documentation and worked examples.

the slow-driving regime, this formalism universally holds in a coarse-grained

simultaneously minimize both the average and fluctuation of the dissipation in

to forgetting syntax elements from sets of formulas with links to many other
forgetting operations, in particular, to Boole's variable elimination. On the

actively reduce signatures in more complex semantic frameworks, also aiming at
forgetting atoms that is very well known from probability theory. In this
paper, we bring these two perspectives of forgetting together by showing that
marginalisation can be considered as an extension of Delgrande's approach to
the level of epistemic states. More precisely, we generalize Delgrande's axioms
of forgetting to forgetting in epistemic states, and show that marginalisation
is the most specific and informative forgetting operator that satisfies these
axioms. Moreover, we elaborate suitable phrasings of Delgrande's concept of
forgetting for formulas by transferring the basic ideas of the axioms to
forgetting formulas from epistemic states. However, here we show that this
results in trivial approaches to forgetting formulas. This finding supports the
claim that forgetting syntax elements is essentially different from belief
contraction, as e.g. axiomatized in the AGM belief change framework.

machine learning. With the explosive growth of data size, the storage and
computation of large dense kernel matrices is a major challenge in scaling KLR.
Even the nystr\""{o}m approximation is applied to solve KLR, it also faces the
time complexity of $O(nc^2)$ and the space complexity of $O(nc)$, where $n$ is
the number of training instances and $c$ is the sampling size. In this paper,
we propose a fast Newton method efficiently solving large-scale KLR problems by
exploiting the storage and computing advantages of multilevel circulant matrix
(MCM). Specifically, by approximating the kernel matrix with an MCM, the
storage space is reduced to $O(n)$, and further approximating the coefficient
matrix of the Newton equation as MCM, the computational complexity of Newton
iteration is reduced to $O(n \log n)$. The proposed method can run in
log-linear time complexity per iteration, because the multiplication of MCM (or
its inverse) and vector can be implemented the multidimensional fast Fourier
transform (mFFT). Experimental results on some large-scale
binary-classification and multi-classification problems show that the proposed
method enables KLR to scale to large scale problems with less memory
consumption and less training time without sacrificing test accuracy.

the advances in differentiable deep learning. However, the very high-resolution
superpixel segmentation still remains challenging due to the expensive memory
and computation cost, making the current advanced superpixel networks fail to
process. In this paper, we devise Patch Calibration Networks (PCNet), aiming to
efficiently and accurately implement high-resolution superpixel segmentation.
PCNet follows the principle of producing high-resolution output from
low-resolution input for saving GPU memory and relieving computation cost. To
recall the fine details destroyed by the down-sampling operation, we propose a
novel Decoupled Patch Calibration (DPC) branch for collaboratively augment the
main superpixel generation branch. In particular, DPC takes a local patch from
the high-resolution images and dynamically generates a binary mask to impose
the network to focus on region boundaries. By sharing the parameters of DPC and
main branches, the fine-detailed knowledge learned from high-resolution patches
will be transferred to help calibrate the destroyed information. To the best of
our knowledge, we make the first attempt to consider the deep-learning-based

is placed on the modelling of the deformation and failure behaviour of the

metals, which requires the modelling of large plastic deformations, the
mechanical response of composites is typically governed by intra- and
interlaminar damage phenomena. Depending on the polymeric matrix, viscoelastic
effects can interfere particularly with the long-term behaviour of the joint.
We propose a systematic approach to the modelling of composite laminates,
discuss limitations of the used model, and present details of parameter
identification.
  Homogenisation techniques are applied to predict the mechanical behaviour of
the composite in terms of effective anisotropic elastic and viscoelastic
material properties. In combination with a continuum damage approach this model
represents the deformation and failure behaviour of individual laminae.
Cohesive zone elements enable the modelling of delamination processes. The
parameters of the latter models are identified from experiments. The defined
material model for the composite is eventually utilised in the simulation of an
exemplary self-piercing rivetting process.

we offer a rigorous analysis of MAPG methods by, firstly, quantifying the

The resulting graph is typically contains all question-relevant evidences but
also a lot of noise. UNIQORN copes with this input by a graph algorithm for
Group Steiner Trees, that identifies the best answer candidates in the context

information on spot properties and, thus, on magnetic activity. In particular,
the decay of the autocorrelation function (ACF) of light curves is presumed to
be linked to spot/active-region lifetimes, given that some coherence of the
signal is expected throughout their lifetime. In the literature, an exponential
decay has been adopted to describe the ACF. Here, we investigate the relation
between the ACF and the active-region lifetimes. For this purpose, we produce
artificial light curves of rotating spotted stars with different observation,
stellar, and spot properties. We find that a linear decay and respective
timescale better represent the ACF than the exponential decay. We therefore
adopt a linear decay. The spot/active-region timescale inferred from the ACF is
strongly restricted by the observation length of the light curves. For 1-year
light curves our results are consistent with no correlation between the
inferred and the input timescales. The ACF decay is also significantly affected
by differential rotation and spot evolution: strong differential rotation and
fast spot evolution contribute to a more severe underestimation of the
active-region lifetimes. Nevertheless, in both circumstances the observed
timescale is still correlated with the input lifetimes. Therefore, our analysis
suggests that the ACF decay can be used to obtain a lower limit of the
active-region lifetimes for relatively long-term observations. However,
strategies to avoid or flag targets with fast active-region evolution or
displaying stable beating patterns associated with differential rotation should
be employed.

processing is suboptimal for simultaneously restoring the degraded pixels as
well as reconstructing the clean regions of the image. To overcome this
limitation, we propose SPAIR, a network design that harnesses
distortion-localization information and dynamically adjusts computation to
difficult regions in the image. SPAIR comprises of two components, (1) a
localization network that identifies degraded pixels, and (2) a restoration
network that exploits knowledge from the localization network in filter and
feature domain to selectively and adaptively restore degraded pixels. Our key
idea is to exploit the non-uniformity of heavy degradations in spatial-domain
and suitably embed this knowledge within distortion-guided modules performing
sparse normalization, feature extraction and attention. Our architecture is
agnostic to physical formation model and generalizes across several types of
spatially-varying degradations. We demonstrate the efficacy of SPAIR
individually on four restoration tasks-removal of rain-streaks, raindrops,
shadows and motion blur. Extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons
with prior art on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our

limit when $q\to 1$, which coincides with the small cohomological $J$-function.
Furthermore, in the case of a Fano toric manifold $X$ of Picard rank 2, we
prove the $K$-theoretic version of an identity due to Iritani that compares the
$I$-function of the toric manifold and the oscillatory integral of the toric

Pole-like objects, such as traffic signs, poles, lamps, etc., are ideal
landmarks for localization in urban environments due to their local

accurate, and fast pole extraction approach that runs online and has little
computational demands such that this information can be used for a localization
system. Our method performs all computations directly on range images generated
from 3D LiDAR scans, which avoids processing 3D point cloud explicitly and
enables fast pole extraction for each scan. We test the proposed pole
extraction and localization approach on different datasets with different LiDAR
scanners, weather conditions, routes, and seasonal changes. The experimental
results show that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches,
while running online without a GPU. Besides, we release our pole dataset to the
public for evaluating the performance of pole extractor, as well as the
implementation of our approach.

a single TSDF volume. In order to improve the matching performance between

ATSC increases the size of the surface vulnerable to potential cyber-attack,
allowing an attacker to generate disastrous traffic congestion in a roadway

cost to $O(N^2)$ or less. We show that the accuracy of the approximation can be
improved by optimizing the ""variance"" of the energy simultaneously with the
energy itself. We also find that a reweighting method in Monte Carlo sampling
can stabilize the calculation. These improvements can be applied to other
approaches based on variational Monte Carlo methods. Moreover, we show that the

the key to improve the video-based Human-Object Interaction recognition
performance. In this paper, Spatio-Temporal Interaction Graph Parsing Networks
(STIGPN) are constructed, which encode the videos with a graph composed of
human and object nodes. These nodes are connected by two types of relations:
(i) spatial relations modeling the interactions between human and the
interacted objects within each frame. (ii) inter-time relations capturing the
long range dependencies between human and the interacted objects across frame.
With the graph, STIGPN learn spatio-temporal features directly from the whole

demonstrate that a polarization fraction of disk-scattered light varies across
the ice-band wavelengths depending on ice grain properties; hence, polarimetric
spectra would be another tool for characterizing water-ice properties. Finally,
we argue that the observed reddish disk-scattered light is due to grains with a
few microns in size. To explain the presence of such grains at the disk
surface, we need a mechanism that can efficiently oppose dust settling. If we

significant part of public discourse now takes place on algorithmically driven
platforms owned by a handful of private companies. Despite its growing
importance, there is scant large-scale academic research on the long-term
evolution of user behaviour on these platforms, because the data are often
proprietary to the platforms. Here, we evaluate the individual behaviour of
600,000 Twitter users between 2012 and 2019 and find empirical evidence for an
acceleration of the way Twitter is used on an individual level. This manifests
itself in the fact that cohorts of Twitter users behave differently depending
on when they joined the platform. Behaviour within a cohort is relatively
consistent over time and characterised by strong internal interactions, but
over time behaviour from cohort to cohort shifts towards increased activity.
Specifically, we measure this in terms of more tweets per user over time,
denser interactions with others via retweets, and shorter content horizons,
expressed as an individual's decaying autocorrelation of topics over time. Our
observations are explained by a growing proportion of active users who not only
tweet more actively but also elicit more retweets. These behaviours suggest a
collective contribution to an increased flow of information through each
cohort's news feed -- an increase that potentially depletes available
collective attention over time. Our findings complement recent, empirical work
on social acceleration, which has been largely agnostic about individual user
activity.

mitigate the data privacy risk of collaborative training since it merely
collects local gradients from users without access to their data. However, FL

gravitational microlensing. During a microlensing event, the temporary
brightness increase leads to improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio, and
thereby better detectability of pulsational signatures in light curves. We
explore this possibility under two primary considerations. The first is when
the standard point-source and point-lens approximation applies. In this
scenario, dividing the observed light curve by the best-fitted microlensing
model leads to residuals that result in pulsational features with improved
uncertainties. The second is for transit events (single lens) or caustic
crossing (binary lens). The point-source approximation breaks down, and
residuals relative to a simple best-fitted microlensing model display more
complex behavior. We employ a Monte-Carlo simulation of microlensing of
pulsating variables toward the Galactic bulge for the surveys of OGLE and of
KMTNet. We demonstrate that the efficiency for detecting pulsational signatures
with intrinsic amplitudes of $<0.25$ mag during single and binary microlensing
events, at differences in $\chi^{2}$ of $\Delta \chi^{2} >350$, is $\sim
50-60\%$. The maximum efficiency occurs for pulsational periods $P \simeq
0.1-0.3$ days. We also study the possibility that high-magnification
microlensing events of non-radially pulsating stars (NRPs) could be
misinterpreted as planetary or binary microlensing events. We conclude that
small asymmetric features around lightcurve peaks due to stellar pulsations
could be misdiagnosed with crossing (or passing close to) small caustic curves.

rather than allowing the user to get a fixed small amount of Ether, a more

different parity and different harmonic numbers. Moreover, for each harmonic
and parity, the equations for the perturbations can be decoupled in terms of
(gauge-invariant) master functions that satisfy 1+1 wave equations. By working
in a completely general perturbative gauge, in this paper we study what is the

The outcome of the study is that for each parity we have two branches of

results: In the odd-parity case, the most general master function is an
arbitrary linear combination of the Regge-Wheeler and the
Cunningham-Price-Moncrief master functions whereas in the even-parity case it
is an arbitrary linear combination of the Zerilli master function and another
master function that is new to our knowledge. The other branch is very
different since it includes an infinite collection of potentials which in turn
lead to an independent collection master of functions which depend on the
potential. The allowed potentials satisfy a non-linear ordinary differential
equation. Finally, all the allowed master functions are gauge invariant and can
be written in a fully covariant form.

The
system comprises multiple agents in this problem, each with a set of local data
points and an associated local cost function. The agents are connected to a
server, and there is no inter-agent communication. The agents' goal is to learn
a parameter vector that optimizes the aggregate of their local costs without
revealing their local data points. In principle, the agents can solve this
problem by collaborating with the server using the traditional distributed
gradient-descent method. However, when the aggregate cost is ill-conditioned,
the gradient-descent method (i) requires a large number of iterations to
converge, and (ii) is highly unstable against process noise. We propose an
iterative pre-conditioning technique to mitigate the deleterious effects of the
cost function's conditioning on the convergence rate of distributed
gradient-descent. Unlike the conventional pre-conditioning techniques, the
pre-conditioner matrix in our proposed technique updates iteratively to
facilitate implementation on the distributed network. In the distributed
setting, we provably show that the proposed algorithm converges linearly with
an improved rate of convergence than the traditional and adaptive
gradient-descent methods. Additionally, for the special case when the minimizer
of the aggregate cost is unique, our algorithm converges superlinearly. We
demonstrate our algorithm's superior performance compared to prominent
distributed algorithms for solving real logistic regression problems and
emulating neural network training via a noisy quadratic model, thereby
signifying the proposed algorithm's efficiency for distributively solving
non-convex optimization. Moreover, we empirically show that the proposed

decoherence errors, any delay in the instruction execution of quantum control
microarchitecture can lead to the loss of quantum information and incorrect
computation results. Hence, it is crucial for the control microarchitecture to
issue quantum operations to the Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) in time. As in
classical microarchitecture, parallelism in quantum programs needs to be
exploited for speedup. However, three challenges emerge in the quantum
scenario: 1) the quantum feedback control can introduce significant pipeline
stall latency; 2) timing control is required for all quantum operations; 3) QPU
requires a deterministic operation supply to prevent the accumulation of
quantum errors.
  In this paper, we propose a novel control microarchitecture design to exploit
Circuit Level Parallelism (CLP) and Quantum Operation Level Parallelism (QOLP).
Firstly, we develop a Multiprocessor architecture to exploit CLP, which
supports dynamic scheduling of different sub-circuits. This architecture can
handle parallel feedback control and minimize the potential overhead that
disrupts the timing control. Secondly, we propose a Quantum Superscalar
approach that exploits QOLP by efficiently executing massive quantum
instructions in parallel. Both methods issue quantum operations to QPU
deterministically. In the benchmark test of a Shor syndrome measurement, a
six-core implementation of our proposal achieves up to 2.59$\times$ speedup
compared with a single core. For various canonical quantum computing
algorithms, our superscalar approach achieves an average of 4.04$\times$
improvement over a baseline design. Finally, We perform a simultaneous
randomized benchmarking (simRB) experiment on a real QPU using the proposed
microarchitecture for validation.

optimization problems. One is based upon an l2-constrained l0 optimization
problem. Such problem is relaxed by an l1-l2 optimization problem in the other
sparse PPC setting. We utilize effective solving methods for the latter
optimization problems. Moreover, we show that in the presence of plant
disturbances, the l2-constrained l0 sparse PPC and unconstrained l1-l2 sparse
PPC guarantee practical stability for the system if certain conditions are met.
More precisely, in each case, we can derive an upper bound on system state if
the design parameters satisfy certain conditions. The bounds we derive are
increasing with respect to the disturbance magnitude. We show via simulation
that in both cases of proposed sparse PPC strategies, larger disturbances bring
about performance degradation with no effect on system practical stability.

languages are an old and well-researched problem, the resulting vulnerabilities
still dominate real-world exploitation today. Various mitigations have been
proposed to alleviate the problem, mainly in the form of language dialects,
static program analysis, and code or binary instrumentation. Solutions like
AdressSanitizer (ASan) and Softbound/CETS have proven that the latter approach
is very promising, being able to achieve memory safety without requiring manual
source code adaptions, albeit suffering substantial performance and memory
overheads. While performance overhead can be seen as a flexible constraint,
extensive memory overheads can be prohibitive for the use of such solutions in
memory-constrained environments. To address this problem, we propose MESH, a
highly memory-efficient safe heap for C/C++. With its constant, very small
memory overhead (configurable up to 2 MB on x86-64) and constant complexity for
pointer access checking, MESH offers efficient, byte-precise spatial and
temporal memory safety for memory-constrained scenarios. Without jeopardizing
the security of safe heap objects, MESH is fully compatible with existing code
and uninstrumented libraries, making it practical to use in heterogeneous
environments. We show the feasibility of our approach with a full LLVM-based
prototype supporting both major architectures, i.e., x86-64 and ARM64, in a
Linux runtime environment. Our prototype evaluation shows that, compared to
ASan and Softbound/CETS, MESH can achieve huge memory savings while preserving
similar execution performance.

quasar spectra. These distortions are caused by microlensing from the stars in
the lensing galaxy, which produce differential magnification of spatially and
kinematically separated parts of the broad line region (BLR). The
quasi-simultaneous visible and near-infrared spectroscopy of the lensed quasar
Q2237+0305 reveals strong microlensing-induced line deformations in the
high-ionization CIV $\lambda$ 1549 \AA and the low-ionization H$\alpha$
emission lines. We use this effect to constrain the BLR size, geometry, and
kinematics in Q2237+0305. For this purpose, we modeled the deformation of the
emission lines for three representative BLR models: a Keplerian disk, an
equatorial wind, and a biconical polar wind. We considered various inclinations
with respect to the line of sight. We find that the observed microlensing
effect, characterized by a set of four indices, can only be reproduced by a
subsample of the considered BLR models. The microlensing analysis favors a
Keplerian disk model for the regions emitting the CIV and the H$\alpha$
emission lines. A polar wind model remains possible for the CIV BLR, although
it is less likely. The equatorial wind model is totally excluded. A preferred
inclination of the BLR of 40$\deg$ is found, in agreement with expectations for
a type 1 AGN and past constraints on the accretion disk inclination. The
half-light radius of the BLR is $ r_{\rm 1/2} \simeq$ 47$\pm$19 light-days,
with no significant difference between the CIV and H$\alpha$ BLRs. The size of
the CIV BLR agrees with the radius-luminosity relation derived from
reverberation mapping, while the size of the Balmer line BLR is one order of
magnitude smaller, possibly revealing different quasar properties at high
luminosities and high accretion rates.

relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov (FT-RHB) model is developed in the
charge-exchange channel to study the temperature evolution of spin-isospin
excitations. Calculations are performed self-consistently with relativistic
point-coupling interactions DD-PC1 and DD-PCX. In the charge-exchange channel,
the pairing interaction can be split into isovector ($T = 1$) and isoscalar ($T
= 0$) parts. For the isovector component, the same separable form of the Gogny
D1S pairing interaction is used both for the ground-state calculation as well
as for the residual interaction, while the strength of the isoscalar pairing in
the residual interaction is determined by comparison with experimental data on
Gamow-Teller resonance (GTR) and Isobaric analog resonance (IAR) centroid
energy differences in even-even tin isotopes. The temperature effects are
introduced by treating Bogoliubov quasiparticles within a grand-canonical
ensemble. Thus, unlike the conventional formulation of the quasiparticle
random-phase approximation (QRPA) based on the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)
basis, our model is formulated within the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB)
quasiparticle basis. Implementing a relativistic point-coupling interaction and
a separable pairing force allows for the reduction of complicated two-body
residual interaction matrix elements, which considerably decreases the
dimension of the problem in the coordinate space. The main advantage of this
method is to avoid the diagonalization of a large QRPA matrix, especially at
finite temperature where the size of configuration space is significantly
increased. The implementation of the linear response code is used to study the
temperature evolution of IAR, GTR, and spin-dipole resonance (SDR) in even-even

surfaces. Following the work of Huybrechts [doi:10.4171/CMH/465], we introduce
the twisted derived equivalence between abelian surfaces. We show that there is
a twisted derived Torelli theorem for abelian surfaces over algebraically
closed fields with characteristic $\neq 2,3$. Over complex numbers, the derived
isogenies correspond to rational Hodge isometries between the second cohomology
groups, which is in analogy to the work of Huybrechts and Fu-Vial on K3
surfaces. Their proof relies on the global Torelli theorem over $\mathbb{C}$,
which is missing in positive characteristics. To overcome this issue, we
firstly extend a trick given by Shioda on integral Hodge structures, to
rational Hodge structures, $\ell$-adic Tate modules and $F$-crystals. Then we
make use of Tate's isogeny theorem to give a characterization of the twisted
derived equivalences between abelian surfaces via isogenies. As a consequence,
we show the two abelian surfaces are principally isogenous if and only if they
are derived isogenous.

as a problem well-suited for deep learning methods. Each successive technique
demonstrates an improvement over existing methods by reporting higher image
quality scores. This paper, however, highlights that such improvements in
objective metrics do not necessarily translate to visually superior images. The
first problem is the use of disparate evaluation conditions in terms of data
and metric parameters, calling for a standardized protocol to make it possible
to compare between papers. The second problem, which forms the main focus of
this paper, is the inherent difficulty in evaluating SI-HDR reconstructions
since certain aspects of the reconstruction problem dominate objective
differences, thereby introducing a bias. Here, we reproduce a typical
evaluation using existing as well as simulated SI-HDR methods to demonstrate
how different aspects of the problem affect objective quality metrics.
Surprisingly, we found that methods that do not even reconstruct HDR
information can compete with state-of-the-art deep learning methods. We show
how such results are not representative of the perceived quality and that
SI-HDR reconstruction needs better evaluation protocols.

answer these questions. In particular, the field of Real-Time Optimization
(RTO) has emerged that, among others, encompasses methods that allow the
systematic improvement of the performances of the industrial system, using
plant measurements and a potentially inaccurate tool to predict its behaviour,
generally in the form of a model. Even though the definition of RTO can differ
between authors, inside and outside the process systems engineering community,
there is currently no RTO method, which is deemed capable of fully automating

inconsistencies in static graphs. Nevertheless, inconsistencies may occur over
evolving graphs and only for certain time periods. The need for capturing such
inconsistencies in temporal graphs is evident in anomaly detection and
predictive dynamic network analysis. This paper introduces a class of data
dependencies called Temporal Graph Functional Dependencies (TGFDs). TGFDs
generalize functional dependencies to temporal graphs as a sequence of graph
snapshots that are induced by time intervals, and enforce both topological
constraints and attribute value dependencies that must be satisfied by these
snapshots. (1) We establish the complexity results for the satisfiability and
implication problems of TGFDs. (2) We propose a sound and complete
axiomatization system for TGFDs. (3) We also present efficient parallel
algorithms to detect inconsistencies in temporal graphs as violations of TGFDs.
The algorithm exploits data and temporal locality induced by time intervals,
and uses incremental pattern matching and load balancing strategies to enable
feasible error detection in large temporal graphs. Using real datasets, we
experimentally verify that our algorithms achieve lower runtimes compared to
existing baselines, while improving the accuracy over error detection using
existing graph data constraints, e.g., GFDs and GTARs with 55% and 74% gain in

long-offset/wide-azimuth node data can be designed with a few discrete
frequencies. However, 3D frequency-domain seismic modeling remains challenging
since it requires solving a large and sparse linear indefinite system per
frequency. When such systems are solved with direct methods or hybrid
direct/iterative solvers, based upon domain decomposition preconditioner,
finite-difference stencils on regular Cartesian grids should be designed to
conciliate compactness and accuracy, the former being necessary to mitigate the
fill-in induced by the Lower-Upper (LU) factorization. Compactness is
classically implemented by combining several second-order accurate stencils
covering the eight cells surrounding the collocation point, leading to the
so-called 27-point stencil. Accuracy is obtained by applying optimal weights on
the different stiffness and consistent mass matrices such that numerical
dispersion is jointly minimized for several number of grid points per
wavelength ($G$). However, with this approach, the same weights are used at
each collocation point, leading to suboptimal accuracy in heterogeneous media.
In this study, we propose a straightforward recipe to improve the accuracy of
the 27-point stencil. First, we finely tabulate the values of $G$ covering the
range of wavelengths spanned by the subsurface model and the frequency. Then,
we estimate with a classical dispersion analysis in homogeneous media the
corresponding table of optimal weights that minimize dispersion for each $G$
treated separately. We however apply a Tikhonov regularization to guarantee
smooth variation of the weights with $G$. Finally, we build the impedance
matrix by selecting the optimal weights at each collocation point according to
the local wavelength, hence leading to a wavelength-adaptive stencil.

positioning errors and anatomical changes. One key component of online ART is
accurately and efficiently delineating organs at risk (OARs) and targets on
online images, such as CBCT, to meet the online demands of plan evaluation and
adaptation. Deep learning (DL)-based automatic segmentation has gained great
success in segmenting planning CT, but its applications to CBCT yielded
inferior results due to the low image quality and limited available contour
labels for training. To overcome these obstacles to online CBCT segmentation,
we propose a registration-guided DL (RgDL) segmentation framework that
integrates image registration algorithms and DL segmentation models. The
registration algorithm generates initial contours, which were used as guidance
by DL model to obtain accurate final segmentations. We had two implementations
the proposed framework--Rig-RgDL (Rig for rigid body) and Def-RgDL (Def for
deformable)--with rigid body (RB) registration or deformable image registration
(DIR) as the registration algorithm respectively and U-Net as DL model
architecture. The two implementations of RgDL framework were trained and
evaluated on seven OARs in an institutional clinical Head and Neck (HN)
dataset. Compared to the baseline approaches using the registration or the DL
alone, RgDL achieved more accurate segmentation, as measured by higher mean
Dice similarity coefficients (DSC) and other distance-based metrics. Rig-RgDL
achieved a DSC of 84.5% on seven OARs on average, higher than RB or DL alone by
4.5% and 4.7%. The DSC of Def-RgDL is 86.5%, higher than DIR or DL alone by
2.4% and 6.7%. The inference time took by the DL model to generate final
segmentations of seven OARs is less than one second in RgDL. The resulting
segmentation accuracy and efficiency show the promise of applying RgDL
framework for online ART.

temporal motifs, has become a fundamental primitive for the analysis of
temporal networks, whose edges are annotated with the time of the event they
represent. One of the main complications in studying temporal motifs is the
large number of motifs that can be built even with a limited number of vertices
or edges. As a consequence, since in many applications motifs are employed for
exploratory analyses, the user needs to iteratively select and analyze several
motifs that represent different aspects of the network, resulting in an
inefficient, time-consuming process. This problem is exacerbated in large
networks, where the analysis of even a single motif is computationally
demanding. As a solution, in this work we propose and study the problem of
simultaneously counting the number of occurrences of multiple temporal motifs,
all corresponding to the same (static) topology (e.g., a triangle). Given that
for large temporal networks computing the exact counts is unfeasible, we
propose odeN, a sampling-based algorithm that provides an accurate
approximation of all the counts of the motifs. We provide analytical bounds on
the number of samples required by odeN to compute rigorous, probabilistic,
relative approximations. Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that odeN
enables the approximation of the counts of motifs in temporal networks in a
fraction of the time needed by state-of-the-art methods, and that it also
reports more accurate approximations than such methods.

oscillatory components present in the system. In this paper we develop a
systematic methodology for frequency identification and component filtering of
non-stationary power system forced oscillations (FO) based on multi-channel
TFR. The frequencies of the oscillatory components are identified on the TF

components is carried out on the TF plane applying the anti-transform functions
over the individual TFRs around the identified ridges. This step constitutes an
initial stage for the application of the Dissipating Energy Flow (DEF) method

second order FSST (FSST2). Simulated signals and signals from real operation
are used to show that the proposed method provides a systematic framework for

MPC in a rolling horizon scheme, the impact of uncertainty in forecasts on the

time-constrained grid optimization they are inherently limited by the

optimal control behaviour using function approximation offers the possibility
to determine near-optimal control actions with short calculation time. A Neural
Predictive Control (NPC) scheme is proposed to learn optimal control policies

alongside disk structures (such as gaps or spirals) that may indicate
protoplanet formation. In combination with SCExAO, the CHARIS IFS in
polarimetry mode allows characterization of these systems at wavelengths
spanning the NIR J, H, and K bands ($1.1-2.4$ $\mu m$, $R\sim20$) and at
angular separations as small as 0.04"". By comparing the resulting images with
forward-modeled scattered light or 3D radiative-transfer models, the likely
origins of any observed features can be assessed. Utilization of swift
optimization algorithms, such as differential evolution (DE), to identify model
parameters that best reproduce the observations allows plausible disk
geometries to be explored efficiently. The recent addition of CHARIS's unique
integral field spectropolarimetry mode has further facilitated the study of
planet-forming disks -- aiding in the confirmation of candidate protoplanets,
the diagnosis of disk structures, and the characterization of dust grain
populations. We summarize preliminary results for two young planet-forming disk

boosted trees (GBT), when used for kernel learning, have been shown to be
competitive to their respective tree ensembles (particularly in higher
dimensional scenarios). On the other hand, it has been also shown that
performance of the kernel algorithms depends on the degree of the kernel-target
alignment. However, the kernel-target alignment for kernel learning based on
the tree ensembles has not been investigated and filling this gap is the main
goal of our work.
  Using the eigenanalysis of the kernel matrix, we demonstrate that for
continuous targets good performance of the tree-based kernel learning is
associated with strong kernel-target alignment. Moreover, we show that well
performing tree ensemble based kernels are characterized by strong target
aligned components that are expressed through scalar products between the
eigenvectors of the kernel matrix and the target. This suggests that when tree
ensemble based kernel learning is successful, relevant information for the
supervised problem is concentrated near lower dimensional manifold spanned by
the target aligned components. Persistence of the strong target aligned
components in tree ensemble based kernels is further supported by sensitivity
analysis via landmark learning. In addition to a comprehensive simulation
study, we also provide experimental results from several real life data sets

Precisely recovering instance 3D model in the canonical space and accurately
matching it with the observation is an essential point when estimating 6D pose
for unseen objects. In this paper, we achieve accurate category-level 6D pose
estimation via cascaded relation and recurrent reconstruction networks.
Specifically, a novel cascaded relation network is dedicated for advanced
representation learning to explore the complex and informative relations among
instance RGB image, instance point cloud and category shape prior. Furthermore,
we design a recurrent reconstruction network for iterative residual refinement
to progressively improve the reconstruction and correspondence estimations from
coarse to fine. Finally, the instance 6D pose is obtained leveraging the
estimated dense correspondences between the instance point cloud and the
reconstructed 3D model in the canonical space. We have conducted extensive
experiments on two well-acknowledged benchmarks of category-level 6D pose
estimation, with significant performance improvement over existing approaches.

Under our proposed approach, selected real-world patients are weighted by a

assign the same weight to all real-world patients, our approach upweights of

obtained via Cox proportional hazards models. We compare our approach to

Can efficient and globally exact solutions be obtained? We introduce one such

to monotone linkage functions. We provide a parallel algorithm with a time
complexity over $n$ processors of $\mathcal{O}(n^2g)
+\mathcal{O}(\log{\log{n}})$ where $n$ is the cardinality of the ground set and
$g$ is the complexity to compute the monotone linkage function that induces a

to $\mathcal{O}(gn\log(n))$ on $n^2$ processors and to $\mathcal{O}(gn)$ on
$n^3$ processors. Our algorithm provides a globally optimal solution to a
maxi-min problem as opposed to submodular optimization which is approximate. We
show a potential for widespread applications via an example of diverse feature
subset selection with exact global maxi-min guarantees upon showing that a

flows can be significantly larger than the typical length-scale of the
accretion flows, the gas pressure is anisotropic to magnetic field lines. For
such a large collisional mean free path, the resistive dissipation can also
play a key role in hot accretion flows. In this paper, we study the dynamics of
resistive hot accretion flows in the presence of anisotropic pressure. We
present a set of self-similar solutions where the flow variables are assumed to
be a function only of radius. Our results show that the radial and rotational
velocities and the sound speed increase considerably with the strength of
anisotropic pressure. The increase in infall velocity and in sound speed are
more significant if the resistive dissipation is taken into account. We find
that such changes depend on the field strength. Our results indicate that the
resistive heating is $10\%$ of the heating by the work done by anisotropic
pressure when the strength of anisotropic pressure is 0.1. This value becomes
higher when the strength of anisotropic pressure reduces. The increase in disk
temperature can lead to heating and acceleration of the electrons in such
flows. It helps us to explain the origin of phenomena such as the flares in
Galactic Center Sgr A*.

`quantum number theory' (QNT) as a possible extension of the `classical number
theory'. We built our QNT by defining pure quantum number operators
($q$-numbers) of a Hilbert space that generate classical numbers ($c$-numbers)
belonging to discrete Euclidean spaces. To start with this formalism, we define
a 2-component natural $q$-number $\textbf{N}$, such that $\mathbf{N}^{2} \equiv
N_{1}^{2} + N_{2}^{2}$, satisfying a Heisenberg-Dirac algebra, which allows to
generate a set of natural $c$-numbers $n \in \mathbb{N}$. A probabilistic
interpretation of QNT is then inferred from this representation. Furthermore,
we define a 3-component integer $q$-number $\textbf{Z}$, such that
$\mathbf{Z}^{2} \equiv Z_{1}^{2} + Z_{2}^{2} + Z_{3}^{2}$ and obeys a Lie
algebra structure. The eigenvalues of each $\textbf{Z}$ component generate a
set of classical integers $m \in \mathbb{Z}\cup \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}^{*}$,
$\mathbb{Z}^{*} = \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{0\}$, albeit all components do not
generate $\mathbb{Z}^3$ simultaneously. We interpret the eigenvectors of the
$q$-numbers as `$q$-number state vectors' (QNSV), which form multidimensional
orthonormal basis sets useful to describe state-vector superpositions defined
here as qu$n$its. To interconnect QNSV of different dimensions, associated to
the same $c$-number, we propose a quantum mapping operation to relate distinct
Hilbert subspaces, and its structure can generate a subset $W \subseteq
\mathbb{Q}^{*}$, the field of non-zero rationals. In the present description,
QNT is related to quantum computing theory and allows dealing with nontrivial
computations in high dimensions.

Consideration of the smoother entropy contrasts with previous approaches that
instead resort to marginal (or instantaneous) state entropies due to
tractability concerns. By establishing novel expressions for the smoother
entropy in terms of the POMDP belief state, we show that both the problems of
minimising and maximising the smoother entropy in POMDPs can surprisingly be
reformulated as belief-state Markov decision processes with concave cost and

the smoother entropy a tractable optimisation objective, with structural

traffic signal control (ATSC) to improve a traveler's driving experience by
reducing and redistributing waiting time at an intersection. While an ATSC
combined with a connected vehicle concept can reduce waiting time at an
intersection and improve travel time in a signalized corridor, it is nearly
impossible to reduce traffic delay for congested traffic conditions. To remedy
this defect of the traditional ATCS with connected vehicle data, we have
developed a digital twin-based ATSC (DT-based ATSC) that considers the waiting
time of approaching vehicles towards a subject intersection along with the
waiting time of those vehicles at the immediate upstream intersection. We
conducted a case study using a microscopic traffic simulation, Simulation of
Urban Mobility (SUMO), by developing a digital replica of a roadway network
with signalized intersections in an urban setting where vehicle and traffic
signal data were collected in real-time. Our analyses reveal that the DT-based
ATSC outperforms the connected vehicle-based baseline ATSC in terms of average
cumulative waiting time, distribution of drivers' waiting time, and level of
services for each approach for different traffic demands and therefore
demonstrates our method's superior efficacy.

ivermectin; ii) for mild/moderate Covid-19 there is an 84.1% probability the
risk ratio favours ivermectin. To address concerns expressed about the veracity
of some of the studies we evaluate the sensitivity of the conclusions to any
single study by removing one study at a time. In the worst case, where
(Elgazzar 2020) is removed, the results remain robust, for both severe and mild
to moderate Covid-19. The paper also highlights advantages of using Bayesian
methods over classical statistical methods for meta-analysis. All studies
included in the analysis were prior to data on the delta variant.

unbounded fluid in spherical polar coordinates, in both time and frequency
domains. The solution is an expansion in vector spherical harmonics and given
as a sum of a particular solution, proportional to pressure gradient exhibiting
power-law spatial dependence, and a solution of vector Helmholtz equation
decaying exponentially in far field, the decomposition originally introduced by
Lamb. The solution can be applied to construct the transient exterior flow
induced by an arbitrary velocity distribution at the spherical boundary, such
as arising in the squirmer model of a microswimmer. It can be used to construct
solutions for transient flows driven by initial conditions, unbounded flows
driven by volume forces or disturbance to the unsteady flow due to a stationary
spherical particle. The long-time behavior of solution is controlled by the
flow component corresponding to average (or collective) motion of the boundary.
This conclusion is illustrated by the study of decay of transversal wave in the
presence of a fixed sphere. We further show that the general representation
reduces to the well-known solutions for unsteady flow around a sphere
undergoing oscillatory rigid-body (translation and rotation) motion. The
proposed solution representation provides an explicit form of the velocity
potential far from an oscillating body (""generalized"" Darcy's law) and high-
and low-frequency expansions. The leading-order high-frequency expansion yields
the well-known ideal (inviscid) flow approximation, and the leading-order
low-frequency expansion yields the steady Stokes equations. We derive the
higher-order corrections to these approximations and discuss d'Alembert
paradox. Continuation of the general solution to imaginary frequency yields the
general solution of the Brinkman equations describing viscous flow in porous
medium.

groups that enable topological quantum computation, wherein the storage and
manipulation of information occur in decoherence-free degrees of freedom. This
paper is intended to build off existing texts in the topic [1, 2] to serve as
an introduction to MZMs at the undergraduate level, providing an overview of
many important concepts in condensed matter physics, such as the Bogoliubov-de
Gennes formalism and topological phases. We provide an overview of the
motivation behind finding MZMs and discuss how the nature of these modes can
provide an elegant solution to various challenges in quantum computing. We then
show how MZMs can appear in a toy model known as a Kitaev wire by solving its
spectrum, and conclude with a discussion on the conditions under which they
arise in a one-dimensional chain.
