  Information and Digital Technologies for Development, 2021",,,,"cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Using the primary data collected for 463 farmers in six districts of Haryana,
India, the present study attempts to understand the constituents of farmer's
adaptive capacity at local level and how it can be enhanced. We use path
analysis technique using the lavaan package in RStudio to empirically test the
role of information. We find that information is a direct and significant
contributor to enhancing farmers' adaptive capacity. However, even with
exponential growth in use of technology, particularly information and
communication technologies (ICTs), small farmers still lack access to
information which hinders their capacity to respond to weather and climate
risks. Thus, understanding the mechanism that can facilitate exchange and use
of information by the farming community more effectively is important. We take
an ensemble view of ICTs operationalized using ICT ecosystem and find
significant interlinkages between information, technology and the ICT ecosystem
that facilitate learning and information exchange and therefore contribute to
enhancing farmers' adaptive capacity and building resilience to climate shocks.
We find that ICT ecosystem does facilitate access to information and also
mediate the effect of farmer's capability and willingness to use ICTs for
agricultural purposes. Development of sound ICT ecosystem is likely to help
farmers to better respond to changing climate in the future.

effective approach that leverages the benefits of compact function
approximation to deal with large-scale Markov decision processes.
Independently, the boosting methodology (e.g. AdaBoost) has proven to be
indispensable in designing efficient and accurate classification algorithms by
combining inaccurate rules-of-thumb.
  In this paper, we take a further step: we reduce reinforcement learning to a
sequence of weak learning problems. Since weak learners perform only marginally
better than random guesses, such subroutines constitute a weaker assumption
than the availability of an accurate supervised learning oracle. We prove that
the sample complexity and running time bounds of the proposed method do not
explicitly depend on the number of states.
  While existing results on boosting operate on convex losses, the value
function over policies is non-convex. We show how to use a non-convex variant
of the Frank-Wolfe method for boosting, that additionally improves upon the
known sample complexity and running time even for reductions to supervised
learning.

This issue raises problems when the model needs to be deployed on

vision with reduced complexity and without sacrificing accuracy. Depending on
the dimension of cost volume, we design a 2D and a 3D model with
encoder-decoders built from 2D and 3D convolutions, respectively. To this end,
we leverage 2D MobileNet blocks and extend them to 3D for stereo vision
application. Besides, a new cost volume is proposed to boost the accuracy of
the 2D model, making it performing close to 3D networks. Experiments show that
the proposed 2D/3D networks effectively reduce the computational expense

convert lignin into valuable chemicals. In context, model compounds have been
used to understand the electrocatalyzed depolymerization for mimicking the
typical linkages of lignin. In this investigation, 2-phenoxyacetophenone, a
model compound for lignin \b{eta}-O-4 linkage, was electro-catalytically
hydrogenated (ECH) in distinct three-electrode setups: an open and a membrane
cell. A deep eutectic solvent based on ethylene-glycol and choline chloride was
used to pursue sustainable routes to dissolve lignin. Copper was used as
electrocatalyst due to the economic feasibility and low activity towards
hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a side reaction of ECH. By varying the cell
type, we demonstrate a simple ECH route for the generation of different
monomers and oligomers from lignin. Gas chromatography of the products revealed
a higher content of carbonyl groups in those using the membrane cell, whereas
the open cell produced mostly hydroxyl-end chemicals. Aiming at high

investigated how commercially-driven digital platforms such as mobile money

a boundary resources model and platform governance approaches, this paper aims
to examine how a payment platform facilitates ecosystem value co-creation with
third party actors. An in-depth qualitative inquiry was adopted for the study
using an embedded single-case design. The results show that although ecosystem
value co-creation was enabled by the introduction of boundary resources tools,
some platform governance practices hindered some complementors from harnessing
the affordances of the platforms. These constraints include lack of visibility
of the boundary resources and transparency challenges in the acceptance
criteria. We thus argue that platform generativity on its own is not sufficient
to support ecosystem value co-creation, but requires appropriate platform
governance to deal with behavioural complexity of ecosystem actors by using
optimal control mechanisms.

understood in terms of the digital divide or of forms of digital inequality
whose core conceptualisation is exclusion. This paper argues that, as the
global South moves into a digital development paradigm of growing breadth and
depth of digital engagement, an exclusion worldview is no longer sufficient.
Drawing from ideas in the development studies literature on chronic poverty,
the paper argues the need for a new concept: ""adverse digital incorporation"",
meaning inclusion in a digital system that enables a more-advantaged group to
extract disproportionate value from the work or resources of another,
less-advantaged group. This explains why inequality persists - even grows - in
a digital development paradigm. To help ground future research and practice on
this issue, the paper inductively builds a conceptual model of adverse digital
incorporation with three main component sets: the processes, the drivers, and
the causes of adverse digital incorporation. The paper concludes with thoughts
on a future research and practice agenda that seeks to deliver digital justice
in the global South: a necessary reconfiguration of the broader components of
power that currently shape the inclusionary connection between digital and
inequality.

(mHealth) in the Global South, many such interventions do not include
user-engaging attributes. This is because socio-technical aspects are
frequently not considered during the design, development, and implementation,
stages of such initiatives. In addition, there is little discussion in the
literature about the role socio-technical factors play in user-centered design
processes for mHealth. This research posits consideration of socio-technical
factors is required as techno-centric approaches to mHealth design and user
engagement, as well as those relying on existing universal frameworks for
user-centered design, have proven to be ineffective with the result that most
mHealth projects in the Global South fail to sustain. This research examines
projects in Sierra Leone where semi-structured interviews were conducted with
mHealth designers and developers in order to explore their attitudes towards
user engagement in this case. Barriers and facilitators to user engagement were
identified and classified as either technical or socio-technical. Findings from
the study indicate that adoption of a techno-centric approach without
consideration of socio-technical factors can negatively affect user's
engagement. Based on these findings, we propose to develop a new design
framework for more effective inclusion of user-engaging attributes in mHealth.

Moreover, during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic in which movement and physical

However, many Namibian rural entrepreneurs have not been able to use digital
services to maintain their livelihood. Therefore, this study investigated the
factors affecting the adoption of ICT enabled services by rural entrepreneurs.
The study applied a cross-sectional survey of 77 respondents comprising 14
rural entrepreneurs and 63 rural community members from four sites. It was
found that the five main factors affecting the adoption of digital services by
rural entrepreneurs are a lack of awareness of digital services, electricity,
skills to navigate smart devices, high cost of both devices and mobile internet
and cybercrime. We recommend a tailor-made training program for rural
entrepreneurs which includes raising awareness of digital services and
associated benefits, capacity building on digital skills and best practice for
cybersecurity. In addition, we propose that the Namibian Government should
enhance digital inclusion through a policy initiative to reduce the cost to
make both data and smart devices affordable for the poor and rural communities.

from Hallucination (LfH) paradigm for autonomous navigation executes motion
plans by random exploration in completely safe obstacle-free spaces, uses
hand-crafted hallucination techniques to add imaginary obstacles to the robot's
perception, and then learns motion planners to navigate in realistic,
highly-constrained, dangerous spaces. However, current hand-crafted
hallucination techniques need to be tailored for specific robot types (e.g., a
differential drive ground vehicle), and use approximations heavily dependent on
certain assumptions (e.g., a short planning horizon). In this work, instead of
manually designing hallucination functions, LfLH learns to hallucinate obstacle
configurations, where the motion plans from random exploration in open space
are optimal, in a self-supervised manner. LfLH is robust to different robot
types and does not make assumptions about the planning horizon. Evaluated in
both simulated and physical environments with a ground and an aerial robot,
LfLH outperforms or performs comparably to previous hallucination approaches,
along with sampling- and optimization-based classical methods.

framework to analyze scattering for the one-dimensional wave, Helmholtz,
Schr\""odinger and Riccati equations that allows for coefficients which are more
singular than can be accommodated by previous theory. In place of the standard
scattering matrix or the Weyl-Titchmarsh $m$-function, the analysis centres on
a new object, the generalized reflection coefficient, which maps frequency (or
the spectral parameter) to automorphisms of the Poincar\'e disk. Purely
singular versions of the generalized reflection coefficient, which are amenable
to direct analysis, serve to approximate the general case. Orthogonal
polynomials on both the unit circle and unit disk play a key technical role, as
does an exotic Riemannian structure on PSL$(2,\mathbb{R})$. A central role is
also played by the newly-defined harmonic exponential operator, introduced to
mediate between impedance (or index of refraction) and the reflection
coefficient. The approach leads to new, explicit formulas and effective
algorithms for both forward and inverse scattering. The algorithms may be
viewed as nonlinear analogues of the FFT. In addition, the scattering relation
is shown to be elementary in a precise sense at or below the critical threshold
of continuous impedance. For discontinuous impedance, however, the reflection
coefficient ceases to decay at infinity, the classical trace formula breaks
down, and the scattering relation is complicated by the emergence of almost
periodic structure.

by random-anisotropy magnets. It is governed by strong metastability due to the
broad distribution of energy barriers separating different spin configurations.
At a low microwave power, when the heating is negligible, the spin dynamics is
close to linear. It corresponds to the precession of ferromagnetically ordered
regions that are in resonance with the microwave field. Previously we have
shown (doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.103.214414) that in this regime a dielectric
substance packed with random magnets would be a strong microwave absorber in a
broad frequency range. Here we demonstrate that on increasing the power,
heating and over barrier spin transitions come into play, resulting in the
nonlinear behavior. At elevated temperatures the absorption of microwave power
decreases dramatically, making the dielectric substance with random magnets
transparent for the microwaves.

violence such as cyber bullying, cyber harassment, online defamation,
cyberstalking, sexual exploitation, online hate speech, and revenge
pornography. Perpetrators used digital platforms such Facebook, WhatsApp,
online personal accounts, dating sites, and smartphones to carry out their evil
acts. The study also found that perpetrators' motivations were driven by
revenge, anger, jealousy, sexual desire and political agenda, with the
intentions to harm the victims socially, psychologically, economically, and
physically. The women used coping measures such as confrontation and blocking
the perpetrator or by leaving the online platform. It was found that women
never bothered to report the incidences to the police or community to seek for
support due to lack of awareness, cultural and patriarchal factors. In
conclusion, the study found that the prevalence of cyber violence against women
is rising significantly in Malawi. Therefore, the findings provide insights to

microenterprises in Malawi. The study was an interpretive qualitative approach
in which semi-structured interviews, observation and field notes were used to
collect data. About 25 women involved in various microenterprises in three
rural areas of Karonga district in Malawi were purposively selected to
participate in the study. The framework for the study was based on Serrat's
sustainable livelihood approach. The study noted that the use of ICTs
potentially enabled women microenterprises to build their financial, human,
social, and informational capital assets. The study found that ICTs to some
extent contributed to the livelihoods of women microenterprises such as
improved access to information; diversification of business opportunities,
improved communication, improved marketing, and reduced transport costs. As a
result, this led to sustainable use of resources, improved well-being, and
empowerment for women. However, unreliable electricity; lack of affordable ICT
devices; lack of awareness to utilise ICTs in businesses and lack of ICT
literacy skills were major concerns that affected women microenterprises. The
study offers insights to research practioners, policy makers and other
stakeholders on the role of ICTs in fostering women microentrepreneurship in
rural communities of Malawi.

a way to achieve sustainability and resilience. Building on Green's work (2016)
on social change as a force that cannot be understood without focusing on
systems and power, we claim that ICT4D would benefit from intentionally growing
social capital and fostering networks within its systems. We propose ""network

to complement and advance existing ICT4D frameworks and practices, including
the sense of community of the researchers themselves.

to be removed in order to have a better understanding regarding the functioning

diffractive surface and use a matrix pseudoinverse-based method to determine
the complex-valued transmission coefficients of the diffractive
features/neurons to all-optically perform a desired/target linear
transformation. In addition to this data-free design approach, we also consider
a deep learning-based design method to optimize the transmission coefficients
of diffractive surfaces by using examples of input/output fields corresponding
to the target transformation. We compared the all-optical transformation errors
and diffraction efficiencies achieved using data-free designs as well as
data-driven (deep learning-based) diffractive designs to all-optically perform
(i) arbitrarily-chosen complex-valued transformations including unitary,
nonunitary and noninvertible transforms, (ii) 2D discrete Fourier

significantly larger diffraction efficiencies for a given N and their
all-optical transformations are more accurate for N < N_i x N_o. These
conclusions are generally applicable to various optical processors that employ

overcome the limitations of gyroscopes. This research presents a Non-coplanar
Accelerometer Array (NAA) for estimating angular velocity with non-specific
geometric arrangement of four or more triaxial accelerometers with
non-coplanarity constraint. The presented proof of non-coplanar spacial
arrangement also provides insights into propagation of the sensor noise and
construction of the noise covariance matrices. The system noise depends on the
singular values of the relative displacement matrix (between the sensors). A
dynamical system model with uncorrelated process and measurement noise is
proposed where the accelerometer readings are used simultaneously as process
and measurement inputs. The angular velocity is estimated using an EKF that
discretizes and linearizes the continuous-discrete time dynamical system. The
simulations are performed on a Cube-NAA (Cu-NAA) comprising four accelerometers
placed at different vertices of a cube. They analyze the estimation error for
static and dynamic movement as the distance between the accelerometers is
varied. Here, the system noise is observed to decrease inversely with the
length of the cube edge as the arrangement is kept identical. Consequently, the
simulation results indicate asymptotic decrease in the standard error of
estimation with edge length. The experiments are conducted on a Cu-NAA with
five reflective optical markers. The reflective markers are visually tracked
using VICON to construct the ground truth. This unique experimental setup,
apart from providing three degrees of rotational freedom of movement, also
allows for three degrees of spacial translation (linear acceleration of the
Cu-NAA in space). The simulation and experimental results indicate better
performance of the proposed EKF as compared to one with correlated process and
measurement noises.

produce flows with the hallmarks of turbulence -- even though the effective
Reynolds numbers may be $O(1)$ or smaller. We provide perspectives on

the circular law says that the empirical spectral distribution (ESD) of

a deterministic matrix that converges in $*$-moments to an operator $x_0$. It
is known from the work by \'{S}niady and Tao-Vu that the ESD of
$X_n/\sqrt{n}+M_n$ converges to the Brown measure of $x_0+c$, where $c$ is
Voiculescu's circular operator. We obtain a formula for the Brown measure of
$x_0+c$ which provides a description of the limit distribution. This answers a
question of Biane-Lehner for arbitrary operator $x_0$.
  Generalizing the case of circular and semi-circular operators, we also
consider a family of twisted elliptic operators that are $*$-free from $x_0$.
For an arbitrary twisted elliptic operator $g$, possible degeneracy then
prevents a direct calculation of the Brown measure of $x_0+g$. We instead show
that the whole family of Brown measures are the push-forward measures of the
Brown measure of $x_0+c$ under a family of self-maps of the plane, which could
possibly be singular. We calculate explicit formula for the case $x_0$ is
selfadjoint. In addition, we prove that the Brown measure of the sum of an
$R$-diagonal operator and a twisted elliptic element is supported in a deformed
ring where the inner boundary is a circle and the outer boundary is an ellipse.
  These results generalize some known results about free additive Brownian
motions where the free random variable $x_0$ is assumed to be selfadjoint. The
approach is based on a Hermitian reduction and subordination functions.

labels in order to commission models with acceptable performance. However,
prior work has shown that such requirements can be expensive, taking several
weeks to label thousands of commits, and not always available when traversing
new research problems and domains. Unsupervised Learning is a promising
direction to learn hidden patterns within unlabelled data, which has only been
extensively studied in defect prediction. Nevertheless, unsupervised learning
can be ineffective by itself and has not been explored in other domains (e.g.,
static analysis and issue close time).
  Motivated by this literature gap and technical limitations, we present
FRUGAL, a tuned semi-supervised method that builds on a simple optimization
scheme that does not require sophisticated (e.g., deep learners) and expensive
(e.g., 100% manually labelled data) methods. FRUGAL optimizes the unsupervised
learner's configurations (via a simple grid search) while validating our design
decision of labelling just 2.5% of the data before prediction.
  As shown by the experiments of this paper FRUGAL outperforms the
state-of-the-art adoptable static code warning recognizer and issue closed time
predictor, while reducing the cost of labelling by a factor of 40 (from 100% to
2.5%). Hence we assert that FRUGAL can save considerable effort in data
labelling especially in validating prior work or researching new problems.
  Based on this work, we suggest that proponents of complex and expensive
methods should always baseline such methods against simpler and cheaper
alternatives. For instance, a semi-supervised learner like FRUGAL can serve as
a baseline to the state-of-the-art software analytics.

identical jets. The thickness is one of the most crucial parameters in
quantifying the spray characteristics for which several non-unique solutions
have been acquired theoretically, so far. Among all, three theoretical
solutions presented by Hasson and Peck, Ranz, and Miller are the most reliable
expressions in terms of precision. Apparently, all these distinctive solutions
cannot be physical simultaneously. However, a theoretical satisfactory
explanation for having various non-unique solutions has not been presented.
Moreover, a meaningful criterion to recognize the most physical solution is
highly desirable. To address this gap, it is hypothesized that an additional
constraint should be considered in couple with the continuity and momentum
equations to have a unique prediction for the liquid sheet thickness. By
employing the minimum energy principle, the minimum stored energy in the liquid
sheet is considered the crucial constraint to achieving a unique solution and
rejecting non-physical ones. Since the inviscid flow assumption is reasonably
valid for the liquid sheet, the minimum energy principle satisfies when the
minimum lateral surface predicts. To quantify the lateral surface area the
sheet shape is presented in terms of the sheet thickness and numerically
calculated by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method for the three mentioned
expressions. Using the liquid shape, the lateral surface areas are calculated
and compared in three different impingement angles of 58, 89, and 117 degrees.
In addition, the liquid shapes are visually compared with the experimental
results obtained by the Shadowgraph technique. In sum, it is proved that Hasson
and Peck presented the most physical solution for the liquid sheet thickness.

cohomology classes of high 'category weight', which in turn allow for much
stronger estimates of the size of triangulations of X. We develop several

(autofocusing) is formulated as an inverse problem. An optimization model
utilising a sparsity-enforcing Cauchy regularizer is proposed, and an
alternating minimization framework is used to solve it, in which the desired
image and the phase errors are optimized alternatively. For the image
reconstruction sub-problem (f-sub-problem), two methods are presented capable
of handling the problem's complex nature, and we thus present two variants of
our SAR image autofocusing algorithm. Firstly, we design a complex version of
the forward-backward splitting algorithm (CFBA) to solve the f-sub-problem
iteratively. For the second variant, the Wirtinger alternating minimization
autofocusing (WAMA) method is presented, in which techniques of Wirtinger
calculus are utilized to minimize the complex-valued cost function in the
f-sub-problem in a direct fashion. For both methods, the phase error estimation
sub-problem is solved by simply expanding and observing its cost function.
Moreover, the convergence of both algorithms is discussed in detail. By
conducting experiments on both simulated scenes and real SAR images, the
proposed method is demonstrated to give impressive autofocusing results
compared to other state of the art methods.

regression model (logit) with latent heterogeneous effect on sub-population. In
transportation, logistic regression and its variants are often interpreted as
discrete choice models under utility theory (McFadden, 2001). Two prominent
applications of logit models in the transportation domain are traffic accident
analysis and choice modeling. In these applications, researchers often want to
understand and capture the individual variation under the same accident or
choice scenario. The mixed effect logistic regression (mixed logit) is a
popular model employed by transportation researchers. To estimate the
distribution of mixed logit parameters, a non-convex optimization problem with
nested high-dimensional integrals needs to be solved. Simulation-based
optimization is typically applied to solve the mixed logit parameter estimation
problem. Despite its popularity, the mixed logit approach for learning
individual heterogeneity has several downsides. First, the parametric form of
the distribution requires domain knowledge and assumptions imposed by users,
although this issue can be addressed to some extent by using a non-parametric
approach. Second, the optimization problems arise from parameter estimation for
mixed logit and the non-parametric extensions are non-convex, which leads to
unstable model interpretation. Third, the simulation size in
simulation-assisted estimation lacks finite-sample theoretical guarantees and
is chosen somewhat arbitrarily in practice. To address these issues, we are
motivated to develop a formulation that models the latent individual
heterogeneity while preserving convexity, and avoids the need for
simulation-based approximation. Our setup is based on decomposing the
parameters into a sparse homogeneous component in the population and low-rank
heterogeneous parts for each individual.

the solids fraction becomes large: rapid shearing drives these systems out of
equilibrium and can lead to dramatic increases in viscosity (shear-thickening)

characteristic onset stress when particles are forced into frictional contact.
Here we show via simulations how this can be understood within a framework that
abstracts details of the forces acting at particle-particle contacts into
general stress-activated constraints on relative particle movement. We find
that focusing on just two constraints, affecting sliding and rolling at
contact, can reproduce the experimentally observed shear thickening behavior
quantitatively, despite widely different particle properties, surface
chemistries, and suspending fluids. Within this framework parameters such as
coefficients of sliding and rolling friction can each be viewed as a proxy for
one or more forces of different physical or chemical origin, while the
parameter magnitudes indicate the relative importance of the associated
constraint. In this way, a new link is established that connects features
observable in macroscale rheological measurements to classes of constraints
arising from micro- or nano-scale properties.

\to f$, the cross section is proportional to $y_i^2y_f^2/\Gamma_H$. Thus there
is a multi-solution ambiguity on the couplings due to uncertain knowledge on
Higgs width. In this work, we study the process $g+q \to g+q+l^++l^-$ with the
$t$-channel Higgs boson contribution included. As Higgs boson is not on-shell,
this process can be used to measure the Higgs couplings without the ambiguity.
  Based on the performance of the ATLAS detector in Run~II, the coupling
product $y_gy_Z$ can be potentially constrained to be less than 18 times the
Standard-Model value for a $p$-$p$ dataset of 140~fb$^{-1}$ at
$\sqrt{s}=13$~TeV. Assuming the equality of on-shell couplings and off-shell
couplings and combining the on-shell measurements, the width of the Higgs boson
is constrained to be less than 1.3~GeV, which is similar to that in the direct
measurement.
  In addition, the interference effect is also analyzed.

These algorithms are trained to account for a wide collection of geometric

examine fire performance of normal and high strength RC columns by analyzing a
comprehensive database of fire tests comprising of over 494 observations. The
developed ensemble is also capable of presenting quantifiable insights to ML

establishing a solid step towards transparent and explainable ML. Most
importantly, this work tackles the scarcity of available fire tests by
proposing new techniques to leverage the use of real, synthetic and augmented

validated for standard and design fire exposures and for one, two, three and
four-sided fire exposures thus; covering a wide range of practical scenarios
present during fire incidents. When fully deployed, the developed ensemble can
analyze over 5,000 RC columns in under 60 seconds thus, providing an attractive

easily extended for evaluating fire resistance and spalling of other structural

the impact of interventions at the level of susceptibility rather than the
interventions that directly modify individual opinions themselves. For the
model, Chan et al. (The Web Conference 2019) designed a local search algorithm
to find an optimal solution in polynomial time. However, it can be seen that
the solution obtained by solving the above model might not be implemented in
real-world scenarios. In fact, as we do not consider the amount of changes of

introduce a novel opinion optimization model, where the initial susceptibility

the $\ell_p$-ball centered at the initial susceptibility vector. For the

systems with a well-defined classical limit in the same way as the unequivocal
classical integrability criteria. We examine the proposed diagnostic in the
class of collective spin models characterized by permutation symmetry in the
spins. The well-known Lipkin-Meshov-Glick (LMG) model is a paradigmatic
integrable system in this class with a well-defined classical limit. Thus, this

First, we calculate analytically the average EE of the Dicke basis
$\{|j,m\rangle \}_{m=-j}^j$ in any non-vanishing bipartition, and show that in
the thermodynamic limit, it converges to $1/2$ of the maximal EE in the
corresponding bipartition. Using finite-size scaling, we numerically
demonstrate that the aforementioned average EE in the thermodynamic limit is
universal for all parameter values of the LMG model. Our analysis illustrates
how a value of the average EE far away from the maximal in the thermodynamic

however, these angles are known only approximately or are completely unknown.
It becomes more challenging to reconstruct the image from a collection of
random projections. We propose an adversarial learning based approach to
recover the image and the projection angle distribution by matching the
empirical distribution of the measurements with the generated data. Fitting the
distributions is achieved through solving a min-max game between a generator
and a critic based on Wasserstein generative adversarial network structure. To
accommodate the update of the projection angle distribution through gradient
back propagation, we approximate the loss using the Gumbel-Softmax
reparameterization of samples from discrete distributions. Our theoretical
analysis verifies the unique recovery of the image and the projection
distribution up to a rotation and reflection upon convergence. Our extensive
numerical experiments showcase the potential of our method to accurately
recover the image and the projection angle distribution under noise
contamination.

namely the problem of testing isotropy, or equivalently, the problem of testing
uniformity on the unit hypersphere $\mathcal{S}^{p-1}$ of $\mathbb{R}^p$.
Rather than restricting to tests that can detect specific types of alternatives
only, we consider the broad class of Sobolev tests. While these tests are known
to allow for omnibus testing of uniformity, their non-null behavior and
consistency rates, unexpectedly, remain largely unexplored. To improve on this,
we thoroughly study the local asymptotic powers of Sobolev tests under the most
classical alternatives to uniformity, namely, under rotationally symmetric
alternatives. We show in particular that the consistency rate of Sobolev tests
does not only depend on the coefficients defining these tests but also on the
derivatives of the underlying angular function at zero. For any Sobolev test
and any rotationally symmetric alternative, we derive the consistency rate of
the Sobolev test and determine the corresponding local asymptotic powers. We
show that Sobolev tests with non-zero coefficients at odd (respectively, even)
ranks only are blind (at any polynomial rate) to alternatives with angular
functions whose $k$th-order derivatives at zero vanish for any $k$ odd
(respectively, even). Our asymptotic analysis requires investigating the
non-standard behavior of random Chebyshev polynomials (for $p=2$) and random
Gegenbauer polynomials (for $p\geq 3$) in the vicinity of the uniform
distribution on $\mathcal{S}^{p-1}$. Our non-standard asymptotic results are
illustrated with Monte Carlo exercises.

the need for flexible worker participation, we consider a new FL paradigm
called ""Anarchic Federated Learning"" (AFL) in this paper. In stark contrast to
conventional FL models, each worker in AFL has the freedom to choose i) when to
participate in FL, and ii) the number of local steps to perform in each round
based on its current situation (e.g., battery level, communication channels,
privacy concerns). However, such chaotic worker behaviors in AFL impose many
new open questions in algorithm design. In particular, it remains unclear
whether one could develop convergent AFL training algorithms, and if yes, under
what conditions and how fast the achievable convergence speed is. Toward this
end, we propose two Anarchic Federated Averaging (AFA) algorithms with
two-sided learning rates for both cross-device and cross-silo settings, which
are named AFA-CD and AFA-CS, respectively. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that,
under mild anarchic assumptions, both AFL algorithms achieve the best known
convergence rate as the state-of-the-art algorithms for conventional FL.
Moreover, they retain the highly desirable {\em linear speedup effect} with
respect of both the number of workers and local steps in the new AFL paradigm.
We validate the proposed algorithms with extensive experiments on real-world

allows high-fidelity operations and readout by electromagnetic means. Despite
decades of effort, however, it remains a formidable task to realize an
atomic-scale quantum architecture where multiple electron spin qubits can be
precisely assembled, controllably coupled, and coherently operated. Electron
spin qubits created in dopants in semiconductors and color centers in
insulators, for example, can be well controlled individually6-8 but are
difficult to couple together into a circuit. On the other hand, multiple
magnetic atoms and molecules on surfaces can be coupled to each other by
building sophisticated atomic structures using a scanning tunneling microscope

tunnel junction. Here we demonstrate an atomic-scale qubit platform by showing
atom-by-atom construction, coherent operations, and readout of multiple
electron-spin qubits on a surface. To enable the coherent control of remote
qubits that are outside the tunnel junction, we complement each electron spin
with a local magnetic field gradient from a nearby single-atom magnet. To
enable readout of remote qubits, we employ a sensor qubit in the tunnel
junction and implement pulsed double electron spin resonance. Using these
methods, we demonstrate fast single-, two-, and three-qubit operations in an
all-electrical fashion. Our work marks the creation of an Angstrom-scale qubit

to estimate the contribution to FRB 180924 DM from foreground galactic halos.
Localized by ASKAP to a massive galaxy, this sightline is notable for an
estimated cosmic web contribution to the DM ($\rm DM_{cosmic} =
220~pc~cm^{-3}$), which is less than the average value at the host redshift
($\rm z = 0.3216$) estimated from the Macquart relation ($280~\rm pc~cm^{-3}$).
In the favored models of the cosmic web, this suggests few intersections with
foreground halos at small impact parameters ($\lesssim 100$ kpc). To test this
hypothesis, we carried out spectroscopic observations of the field galaxies
within $\sim$1' of the sightline with VLT/MUSE and Keck/LRIS. Furthermore, we
developed a probabilistic methodology that leverages photometric redshifts
derived from wide-field DES and WISE imaging. We conclude that there is no
galactic halo that closely intersects the sightline and also that the net DM
contribution from halos, $\rm DM_{halos}< 45~pc~cm^{-3}$ (95 % c.l.). This
value is lower than the $\rm DM_{halos}$ estimated from an ""average"" sightline
($121~\rm pc~cm^{-3}$) using the Planck $\Lambda CDM$ model and the Aemulus
halo mass function and reasonably explains its low $\rm DM_{cosmic}$ value. We
conclude that FRB 180924 represents the predicted majority of sightlines in the

foundation for a comprehensive analysis of FRB fields in the near future.

The new method with appropriate time steps is used to explore the effects of

Chaos easily occurs in the Galactic model as the mass of the nucleus, the
internal perturbation parameter, and the anisotropy of the potential of the
elliptical galaxy increase. The dynamics of charged particles around the
magnetized Kerr spacetime is easily chaotic for larger energies of the
particles, smaller initial angular momenta of the particles, and stronger
magnetic fields. The chaotic properties are not necessarily weakened when the
black hole spin increases. The new method can be used for any six-dimensional

  Using Context Inconsistency","Accepted at IEEE ICCV 2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The success of deep neural networks (DNNs) has promoted the widespread
applications of person re-identification (ReID). However, ReID systems inherit
the vulnerability of DNNs to malicious attacks of visually inconspicuous
adversarial perturbations. Detection of adversarial attacks is, therefore, a
fundamental requirement for robust ReID systems. In this work, we propose a
Multi-Expert Adversarial Attack Detection (MEAAD) approach to achieve this goal
by checking context inconsistency, which is suitable for any DNN-based ReID
systems. Specifically, three kinds of context inconsistencies caused by
adversarial attacks are employed to learn a detector for distinguishing the
perturbed examples, i.e., a) the embedding distances between a perturbed query
person image and its top-K retrievals are generally larger than those between a
benign query image and its top-K retrievals, b) the embedding distances among
the top-K retrievals of a perturbed query image are larger than those of a
benign query image, c) the top-K retrievals of a benign query image obtained
with multiple expert ReID models tend to be consistent, which is not preserved
when attacks are present. Extensive experiments on the Market1501 and
DukeMTMC-ReID datasets show that, as the first adversarial attack detection
approach for ReID, MEAAD effectively detects various adversarial attacks and
achieves high ROC-AUC (over 97.5%).

anti-unwinding attitude tracking control problem of a rigid body with uncertain
but constant inertia parameters, without requiring the satisfaction of
persistent excitation (PE) condition. Specifically, a composite immersion and
invariance (I&I) adaptive controller is derived by integrating a
prediction-error-driven learning law into the dynamically scaled I&I adaptive
control framework, wherein we modify the scaling factor so that the algorithm
design does not involve any dynamic gains. To avoid the unwinding problem, a
barrier function is introduced as the attitude error function, along with the
tactful establishment of two crucial algebra properties for exponential
stability analysis. The regressor filtering method is adopted in combination
with the dynamic regressor extension and mixing (DREM) procedure to acquire the
prediction error using only easily obtainable signals. In particular, aiding by
a constructive liner time-varying filter, the scalar regressor of DREM is
extended to generate a new exciting counterpart. In this way, the derived
controller is shown to permit closed-loop exponential stability without PE, in
the sense that both output-tracking and parameter estimation errors
exponentially converge to zero. Further, the composite learning law is
augmented with a power term to achieve synchronized finite/fixed-time parameter
convergence. Numerical simulations are performed to verify the theoretical
findings.

in the literature. While most of the existing methods are limited to the local
functionals especially the graph edges, this paper focuses on selecting the
discrete hub structures of the networks. Specifically, we propose an
inferential method, called StarTrek filter, to select the hub nodes with
degrees larger than a certain thresholding level in the high dimensional
graphical models and control the false discovery rate (FDR). Discovering hub
nodes in the networks is challenging: there is no straightforward statistic for
testing the degree of a node due to the combinatorial structures; complicated
dependence in the multiple testing problem is hard to characterize and control.
In methodology, the StarTrek filter overcomes this by constructing p-values
based on the maximum test statistics via the Gaussian multiplier bootstrap. In
theory, we show that the StarTrek filter can control the FDR by providing
accurate bounds on the approximation errors of the quantile estimation and
addressing the dependence structures among the maximal statistics. To this end,
we establish novel Cram\'er-type comparison bounds for the high dimensional
Gaussian random vectors. Comparing to the Gaussian comparison bound via the
Kolmogorov distance established by \citet{chernozhukov2014anti}, our
Cram\'er-type comparison bounds establish the relative difference between the
distribution functions of two high dimensional Gaussian random vectors. We
illustrate the validity of the StarTrek filter in a series of numerical
experiments and apply it to the genotype-tissue expression dataset to discover

the TFCHE displays quite different dynamical processes comparing with the
classical Cahn--Hilliard equation, in particular, regarding motions of
interfaces and coarsening rates. By using the method of matched asymptotic
expansions, we first derive the sharp interface limit models. Then we can
theoretically analyze the motions of interfaces with respect to different
timescales. For instance, for the TFCHE with the constant diffusion mobility,
the sharp interface limit model is a fractional Stefan problem at the time
scale $t = O(1)$. However, on the time scale $t = O({\varepsilon}^{1/{\alpha}}
)$ the sharp interface limit model is a fractional Mullins--Sekerka model.
Similar asymptotic regime results are also obtained for the case with one-sided
degenerated mobility. Moreover, scaling invariant property of the sharp
interface models suggests that the TFCHE with constant mobility preserves an
${\alpha}/3$ coarsening rate and a crossover of the coarsening rates from
${\alpha}/3$ to ${\alpha}/4$ is obtained for the case with one-sided
degenerated mobility, which are in good agreement with the numerical
experiments.

object from an image of it, i.e. single view 3D reconstruction. However, it has
been suggested that current methods simply adopt a ""nearest-neighbor"" strategy,
instead of genuinely understanding the shape behind the input image. In this
paper, we rigorously show that for many state of the art methods, this issue
manifests as (1) inconsistencies between coarse reconstructions and input
images, and (2) inability to generalize across domains. We thus propose REFINE,
a postprocessing mesh refinement step that can be easily integrated into the
pipeline of any black-box method in the literature. At test time, REFINE
optimizes a network per mesh instance, to encourage consistency between the
mesh and the given object view. This, along with a novel combination of
regularizing losses, reduces the domain gap and achieves state of the art
performance. We believe that this novel paradigm is an important step towards
robust, accurate reconstructions, remaining relevant as new reconstruction
networks are introduced.

optimise an embedding without mapping between the original space and the

has emerged as a very promising approach to manifold learning by evolving
functional mappings from the original space to an embedding. However, genetic

the hydrodynamic viewpoint focusing on the role of electron vorticity. The
spin-resolved momentum flux density of electrons is calculated taking account
of the spin-orbit interaction and uniform magnetization, and the expression for
the spin motive force is obtained as the linear response to a driving electric
field. It is shown that the spin-resolved momentum flux density and motive
force are characterized by troidal moments expressed as vector products of the
applied external electric field and the spin polarization and/or magnetization.
The spin-vorticity and magnetization-vorticity couplings studied recently are
shown to arise from the toridal moments contribution to the momentum flux
density. Spin motive force turns out to have a nonconservative contribution
besides the conventional conservative one due to the spin-vorticity coupling.
Spin accumulation induced by an electric field is calculated to demonstrate the
direct relation between vorticity and induced spin, and the spin Hall effect is
interpreted as due to the spin-vorticity coupling. The spin-vorticity coupling
is shown to give rise to a vorticity-induced torque and a spin relaxation. The
vorticity-induced torque is a linear effect of the spin-orbit interaction and
is expected to be larger than the second-order torques such as nonadiabatic
($\beta$) current-induced torque due to magnetization structure. The intrinsic
inverse spin Hall effect is argued to correspond to the antisymmetric
components of the momentum flux density in the hydrodynamic context.

the EAS muon content in the range of primary cosmic ray energies (1-100)PeV
seems to be more complicated than it was usually supposed. Generally, from the
models of nuclear interaction it follows that the EAS which have produced
gamma-hadron families in the Tien Shan X-ray emulsion chamber did preferably
originate from interaction of the light cosmic ray nuclei, such that their muon
abundance must be ~1.5 times below an average calculated over all showers. In
contrary, the experimental muon counts in the EAS with families demonstrate a
(1.5-2)-fold excess above the average, and this difference starts to be
observable in the showers with the energy above the 3PeV knee of the primary
cosmic ray spectrum. Later on, the rise of muon production in EAS after the

neutrons stemmed from interaction of cosmic ray muons. Thus, the results
obtained by the two completely different methods do mutually agree with each

recognition is an effective method of diagnosis nowadays. However, due to the
influence of the disease stage, corpus, and other factors on data collection,
the ability of every samples within one subject to reflect the status of PD
vary. No samples are useless totally, and not samples are 100% perfect. This
characteristic means that it is not suitable just to remove some samples or
keep some samples. It is necessary to consider the sample transformation for
obtaining high quality new samples. Unfortunately, existing PD speech
recognition methods focus mainly on feature learning and classifier design
rather than sample learning, and few methods consider the sample
transformation. To solve the problem above, a PD speech sample transformation
algorithm based on multitype reconstruction operators is proposed in this
paper. The algorithm is divided into four major steps. Three types of
reconstruction operators are designed in the algorithm: types A, B and C.
Concerning the type A operator, the original dataset is directly reconstructed
by designing a linear transformation to obtain the first dataset. The type B
operator is designed for clustering and linear transformation of the dataset to
obtain the second new dataset. The third operator, namely, the type C operator,
reconstructs the dataset by clustering and convolution to obtain the third
dataset. Finally, the base classifier is trained based on the three new
datasets, and then the classification results are fused by decision weighting.
In the experimental section, two representative PD speech datasets are used for
verification. The results show that the proposed algorithm is effective.
Compared with other algorithms, the proposed algorithm achieves apparent
improvements in terms of classification accuracy.

construct the shadow images of the wormholes. In this work, we explore the
shadow cast by a certain class of rotating wormhole. To search this, we first
compose the null geodesics and study the effects of the parameters on the
photon orbit. We have exposed the form and size of the wormhole shadow and have
found that it is slanted as well as can be altered depending on the different
parameters present in the wormhole spacetime. We also constrain the size and
the spin of the wormhole using the results from M87* observation, by
investigating the average diameter of the wormhole as well as deviation from
circularity with respect to the wormhole throat size. In a future observation,
this type of study may help to indicate the presence of a wormhole in a
galactic region.

  Attack Detection Scheme in the Internet of Things",,,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In a clone node attack, an attacker attempted to physically capture the
devices to gather sensitive information to conduct various insider attacks.
Several solutions for detecting clone node attacks on IoT networks have been
presented in the viewpoints above. These solutions are focused on specific
system designs, processes, and feature sets and act as a high-level abstraction
of underlying system architectures based on a few performance requirements.
However, critical features like formal analysis, modelling, and verification
are frequently overlooked in existing proposed solutions aimed at verifying the
correctness and robustness of systems in order to ensure that no problematic
scenarios or anomalies exist. This paper presents a formal analysis, modelling,
and verification of our existing proposed clone node attack detection scheme in
IoT. Firstly, we modelled the architectural components of the proposed scheme
using High-Level Petri Nets (HLPNs) and then mapped them using their specified
functionalities. Secondly, we defined and analysed the behavioural properties
of the proposed scheme using Z specification language. Furthermore, we used the
Satisfiability Modulo Theories Library (SMT-Lib) and the Z3 Solver to validate
and demonstrate the overall functionality of the proposed scheme. Finally, in
addition to modelling and analysis, this work employs Coloured Petri Nets
(CPNs), which combine Petri Nets with a high-level programming language, making
them more suitable for large-scale system modelling. To perform the simulations
in CPN, we used both timed and untimed models, where timed models are used to
evaluate performance, and untimed models are used to validate logical validity.

increasingly important given the rapid change in the scientific and public
health knowledge-base. However, this access is complicated by social distancing
requirements that disrupt traditional in-person communication. Many refugees
must then rely on alternative information sources to stay informed. Differences
in media types and information sources in turn may be related to anxieties
arising from the virus and perceptions of others' adherence to recommended
protective behaviors. We examine these relationships with survey data from
1,000 refugees living in both camps and non-camp settings in Kenya. Using logit
models, we test relationships between information source and anxiety and the
effect of these variables on refugees' expected behaviors of community members.
Our primary contributions include the finding that information sources
consistently exacerbate (e.g., Facebook) or ameliorate (e.g., news from the
internet) different anxieties, or can have mixed effects (e.g., radio). We also
find that anxiety and information have significant impacts on refugees'
expectations of compliance by others and that, whether between camps or between
camps and non-camp locales, findings vary by location. Our results have
implications for refugee media and infectious disease anxiety scholarship as
well as for managing infectious disease response.

constraints. This research was aimed at exploring the moderating effect of
gender on the adoption of a digital government innovation in Ethiopia based on
the UTAUT model (n=270) and using structural equation modeling (SEM). The
results reveal that gender only moderates the relationship between facilitating
conditions and usage behavior of government employees to adopt the digital
government innovation which is inconsistent with other findings. Another key
finding was that even though the innovation was regarded as not being easy to
use, women identified that they would still use it because of the social
influence from the peers and the bosses. This finding suggests that women
government employees who obtain external support are more likely to use digital
government innovations compared with men who are unlikely to use it even if
they were facilitated. The paper recommends that governments of low-income
countries like Ethiopia should design appropriate policies that encourage women
in digital government.

Euclidean space, local intersection patterns influence global intersection
patterns. A classical result of Eckhoff in 1988 provided an optimal fractional
Helly theorem for axis-aligned boxes, which are Cartesian products of line
segments. Answering a question raised by B\'ar\'any and Kalai, and
independently Lew, we generalize Eckhoff's result to Cartesian products of
convex sets in all dimensions. In particular, we prove that given $\alpha \in
(1-\frac{1}{t^d},1]$ and a finite family $\mathcal{F}$ of Cartesian products of
convex sets $\prod_{i\in[t]}A_i$ in $\mathbb{R}^{td}$ with $A_i\subset
\mathbb{R}^d$ if at least $\alpha$-fraction of the $(d+1)$-tuples in
$\mathcal{F}$ are intersecting then at least
$(1-(t^d(1-\alpha))^{1/(d+1)})$-fraction of sets in $\mathcal{F}$ are
intersecting. This is a special case of a more general result on intersections
of $d$-Leray complexes. We also provide a construction showing that our result
on $d$-Leray complexes is optimal. Interestingly the extremal example is
representable as a family of cartesian products of convex sets, implying the
bound $\alpha>1-\frac{1}{t^d}$ and the fraction $(1-(t^d(1-\alpha))^{1/(d+1)})$
above are also best possible. The well-known optimal construction for
fractional Helly theorem for convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ does not have
$(p,d+1)$-condition for sublinear $p$. Inspired by this we give constructions
showing that, somewhat surprisingly, imposing additional $(p,d+1)$-condition
has negligible effect on improving the quantitative bounds in neither the
fractional Helly theorem for convex sets nor Cartesian products of convex sets.
Our constructions offer a rich family of distinct extremal configurations for
fractional Helly theorem, implying in a sense that the optimal bound is stable.

neural surface reconstruction framework that leverages the knowledge of stereo
matching and feature consistency to optimize the implicit surface
representation. More specifically, we apply a signed distance field (SDF) and a
surface light field to represent the scene geometry and appearance
respectively. The SDF is directly supervised by geometry from stereo matching,
and is refined by optimizing the multi-view feature consistency and the
fidelity of rendered images. Our method is able to improve the robustness of
geometry estimation and support reconstruction of complex scene topologies.
Extensive experiments have been conducted on DTU, EPFL and Tanks and Temples
datasets. Compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves
better mesh reconstruction in wide open scenes without masks as input.

GeV/$\textit{c}^2$ and 4.18 GeV/$\textit{c}^2$ respectively. They are produced
in initial hard scattering processes. Due to their small formation time
($\Delta t \sim0.1 fm/\textit{c}$) as compared to the formation time of QGP
($\Delta t \sim0.3 fm/\textit{c}$) at the LHC, they experience all the stages
occuring during the time evolution of the hot and dense medium produced in
heavy-ion collisions. Therefore, the measurement of open charm and beauty
production allows probing QGP properties and investigating the color charge and
mass dependence of the parton in-medium energy loss. Moreover, due to their
large masses ($m_c , m_b \gg \Lambda_{QCD}$ ) their pp production
cross-sections are calculable within the domain of perturbative QCD
constituting an excellent test of pQCD calculations. The aim of this study is
to understand the processes involved in the production of charm quarks through
the productions of D$^+$, D$^0$, D$^+_s$ and $\Lambda_c^+$ hadrons. Further to
investigate the possibility of hadronization of the charm quarks, ratios like
$\Lambda_c^+$/$D^+$, $D_s^+$/$D^+$, $\Lambda_c^+$/$D^0$ and $D_s^+$/$D^0$ are
also measured. For the current analysis, the events are generated by using
PYTHIA 8 for pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. PYTHIA 8 has proved to be
quite successful in explaining the heavy-flavor particle production at the LHC

resides inside the gapped phase for both the IOG transition and BKT

inversion of the flame front from a convex shape directed towards unburned gas
to a concave shape with a cusp directed to the burned gas, known as a tulip
flame, was investigated for closed and half-open tubes by solving the fully
compressible reactive Navier-Stokes equations with a one-step Arrhenius
chemical model for the highly reactive hydrogen/air and slowly reacting
methane/air mixtures. The development of the tulip flame in hydrogen/air
obtained in simulations with a one-step Arrhenius model was compared with
simulations using a detailed chemical model. It is shown that the inversion of
the flame front and the onset of the tulip flame occurs due to rarefaction
waves generated by the decelerating flame when its surface was reduced due to
extinguishing of the rear parts of the flame skirt at the sidewalls. The
rarefaction waves reduce the flow velocity ahead of the flame, creating an
uneven velocity profile, which facilitate the flame front inversion. In the
case of a flame propagating in a tube with both ends closed, the compression
wave reflected from the tube end opposite to the ignition end, also contribute
to the inversion of the flame front. In the case of fast flames and a
relatively short tube with both closed ends, the rarefaction waves may invert
the flow velocities in the unburned gas towards the propagating flame. The
tulip flame formation mechanism is a purely gas-dynamic phenomenon not
associated with flame instabilities or vortex motion, in agreement with the
conclusion obtained in recent experimental studies [1].

the atmospheres of hot Jupiters by RAdiative Torques (RATs). We find that
silicate grains can be aligned by RATs with the magnetic fields (B-RAT) due to
strong magnetic fields of hot Jupiters, but carbonaceous grains of diamagnetic
material tend to be aligned with the radiation direction (k-RAT). At a low
altitude of $r<2R_{\rm p}$ with $R_{\rm p}$ being the planet radius, only large
grains can be aligned, but tiny grains of $a\sim 0.01\mu$m can be aligned at a
high altitude of $r>3R_{\rm p}$. We then study rotational disruption of dust
grains by the RAdiative Torque Disruption (RATD) mechanism. We find that large
grains can be disrupted by RATD into smaller sizes. Grains of high tensile
strength are disrupted at an altitude of $r>3R_{\rm p}$, but weak grains can be
disrupted at a lower altitude. We suggest that the disruption of large grains

supply that features both intensive and extensive margins and derive a

supply responses, policy parameters, and income distribution affect the
reform-induced welfare gains. Using this formula, I conduct a comparative
welfare analysis of four tax reforms implemented in the United States over the
last four decades, namely the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1993, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation
Act of 2001, and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. I find that these reforms
created welfare gains ranging from -0.16 to 0.62 percent of aggregate labor
income. A sizable part of the gains is generated by the labor force
participation responses of women. Despite three reforms resulted in aggregate
welfare gains, I show that each reform created both winners and losers.
Furthermore, I uncover two patterns in the relationship between welfare gains
and couples' labor income. In particular, the reforms of 1986 and 2017 display
a monotonically increasing relationship, while the other two reforms
demonstrate a U-shaped pattern. Finally, I characterize the bias in welfare
gains resulting from the assumption about a linear tax function. I consider a
reform that changes tax progressivity and show that the linearization bias is
given by the ratio between the tax progressivity parameter and the inverse
elasticity of taxable income. Quantitatively, it means that linearization
overestimates the welfare effects of the U.S. tax reforms by 3.6-18.1%.

motion compensation between video frames to aggregate information from multiple

methods adopted by previous deblurring methods are not blur-invariant, and
consequently, their accuracy is limited for blurry frames with different blur
amounts. To alleviate this problem, we propose two novel approaches to deblur
videos by effectively aggregating information from multiple video frames.
First, we present blur-invariant motion estimation learning to improve motion
estimation accuracy between blurry frames. Second, for motion compensation,
instead of aligning frames by warping with estimated motions, we use a pixel
volume that contains candidate sharp pixels to resolve motion estimation
errors. We combine these two processes to propose an effective recurrent video

interactions with microstructural features of biological systems, but its
specificity remains limited due to the ambiguity of its relation to the
underlying microstructure. To improve specificity, biophysical models of white
matter (WM) typically express dMRI signals according to the Standard Model (SM)
and have more recently in gray matter (GM) attempted to incorporate cell soma
(the SANDI model). The validity of the assumptions underlying these models,
however, remains largely undetermined, especially in GM. Observing the models'
unique, functional properties, such as the $b^{-1/2}$ power-law associated with
1d diffusion, has emerged as a fruitful strategy for experimental validation.
The absence of this signature in GM has been explained by neurite water
exchange, non-linear morphology, and/or obscuring soma signal contributions.
Here, we present simulations in realistic neurons demonstrating that curvature
and branching does not destroy the stick power-law in impermeable neurites, but
that their signal is drowned by the soma under typical experimental conditions:
Nevertheless, we identify an attainable experimental regime in which the
neurite signal dominates. Furthermore, we find that exchange-driven time
dependence produces a behavior opposite to that expected from restricted
diffusion, thereby providing a functional signature disambiguating the two
effects. We present data from dMRI experiments in ex vivo rat brain at
ultrahigh field and observe a time dependence consistent with substantial
exchange and a GM stick power-law. The first finding suggests significant water
exchange while the second suggests a small sub-population of impermeable
neurites. To quantify our observations, we harness the K\""arger exchange model
and incorporate the corresponding signal time dependence in SM and SANDI.

a performance criterion based on the lower mean square error between the

empowers the lightweight network to get a significant improvement on

devise a novel distillation module tailored for medical image segmentation to

the student network to mimic the extent of difference of representations

boundary problem encountered when dealing with medical imaging but instead
encodes the internal information of each semantic region for transferring.
Benefited from our module, the lightweight network could receive an improvement
of up to 32.6% in our experiment while maintaining its portability in the

FPS proposes an effective approach to escape from local optima by preferring

$\bm k$-dependent Cooper pair potentials based on the geometric properties of
Bloch electrons. We apply the formula to a model of the monolayer FeSe obtained
by the first-principles calculation. Our numerical calculations point to a
significant enhancement of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition
temperature due to the geometric contribution to the superfluid weight, which
is not included in the Fermi liquid theory. The $\bm k$-dependence of the gap
function also stabilizes the superconducting state. Our results reveal that the
geometric properties of Bloch electrons play an essential role in
superconducting materials and pave the way for clarifying hidden aspects of
superconductivity from the viewpoint of quantum geometry.

entropy-regularized algorithm for solving the optimal transport on a graph
problem within the randomized shortest paths formalism. More precisely, a unit
flow is injected into a set of input nodes and collected from a set of output
nodes while minimizing the expected transportation cost together with a paths
relative entropy regularization term, providing a randomized routing policy.
The main advantage of this new formulation is the fact that it can easily
accommodate edge flow capacity constraints which commonly occur in real-world
problems. The resulting optimal routing policy, i.e., the probability
distribution of following an edge in each node, is Markovian and is computed by
constraining the input and output flows to the prescribed marginal
probabilities thanks to a variant of the algorithm developed in [8]. In
addition, experimental comparisons with other recently developed techniques
show that the distance measure between nodes derived from the introduced model
provides competitive results on semi-supervised classification tasks.

inherent in the dataset, failing to generalize in an unbiased data
distribution. Although previous approaches pre-define the type of dataset bias
to prevent the network from learning it, recognizing the bias type in the real
dataset is often prohibitive. This paper proposes a novel bias-tailored
augmentation-based approach, BiaSwap, for learning debiased representation
without requiring supervision on the bias type. Assuming that the bias
corresponds to the easy-to-learn attributes, we sort the training images based
on how much a biased classifier can exploits them as shortcut and divide them
into bias-guiding and bias-contrary samples in an unsupervised manner.
Afterwards, we integrate the style-transferring module of the image translation
model with the class activation maps of such biased classifier, which enables
to primarily transfer the bias attributes learned by the classifier. Therefore,
given the pair of bias-guiding and bias-contrary, BiaSwap generates the
bias-swapped image which contains the bias attributes from the bias-contrary
images, while preserving bias-irrelevant ones in the bias-guiding images. Given
such augmented images, BiaSwap demonstrates the superiority in debiasing
against the existing baselines over both synthetic and real-world datasets.
Even without careful supervision on the bias, BiaSwap achieves a remarkable
performance on both unbiased and bias-guiding samples, implying the improved
generalization capability of the model.

recent fast development. Their growth dynamics depends on different factors
that must be optimized. Since they get their energy from photosynthesis, light
is a key factor that strongly influences their productivity. Light is absorbed
and scattered in the liquid medium, and irradiance exponentially decreases
towards the darkest part of the photobioreactor at a rate nonlinearly depending
on the biomass concentration. Maximizing productivity is then a tricky problem,
especially when the growth rate is inhibited by an excess of light.
Productivity optimization turns out to be highly dependent on how light is
distributed along the reactor, and is therefore related to the extinction rate
and the background turbidity. The concept of optical depth productivity is
introduced for systems where background turbidity must be accounted for and a
global optimum maximizing productivity is proposed, extending the concept of
the compensation condition. This optimal condition consists in compensating the
algal growth rate at the bottom of the reactor by the respiration. This
condition can drive the optimization of the surface biomass productivity
depending on the minimum reachable depth. We develop a nonlinear controller and
prove the global asymptotic stability of the biomass concentration towards the
desired optimal value.

challenge to minimize the number of word changes necessary to induce

soundness, and semantic similarity. In this paper, we propose a Bigram and
Unigram based adaptive Semantic Preservation Optimization (BU-SPO) method to
examine the vulnerability of deep models. Our method has four major merits.
Firstly, we propose to attack text documents not only at the unigram word level
but also at the bigram level which better keeps semantics and avoids producing
meaningless outputs. Secondly, we propose a hybrid method to replace the input
words with options among both their synonyms candidates and sememe candidates,
which greatly enriches the potential substitutions compared to only using
synonyms. Thirdly, we design an optimization algorithm, i.e., Semantic
Preservation Optimization (SPO), to determine the priority of word
replacements, aiming to reduce the modification cost. Finally, we further
improve the SPO with a semantic Filter (named SPOF) to find the adversarial
example with the highest semantic similarity. We evaluate the effectiveness of
our BU-SPO and BU-SPOF on IMDB, AG's News, and Yahoo! Answers text datasets by
attacking four popular DNNs models. Results show that our methods achieve the
highest attack success rates and semantics rates by changing the smallest

in an explicitly convergent form by applying Cauchy's integral theorem to each
scalar field. In the step an integration path for the scalar field is deformed
on a complex plane such that the $\phi^4$ term becomes a damping factor in the

discretized by the Gauss-Hermite quadrature and then the path integral turns
out to be a multiple sum. Finally in order to efficiently evaluate the

learn an embedding space with a general objective of increasing interclass

of metric learning usually suppress intraclass variations which might be
helpful to identify samples of unseen classes. To address this problem, we
propose to adaptively learn an ensemble of features that characterizes an image
from different aspects to model both interclass and intraclass distributions.
We further employ a relational module to capture the correlations among each
feature in the ensemble and construct a graph to represent an image. We then
perform relational inference on the graph to integrate the ensemble and obtain
a relation-aware embedding to measure the similarities. Extensive experiments
on the widely-used CUB-200-2011, Cars196, and Stanford Online Products datasets
demonstrate that our framework improves existing deep metric learning methods

complex epidemic transmissions, infection and contagion, which are very
different from known epidemics. The challenges in quantifying COVID-19
complexities include effectively modeling its process and data uncertainties.
The uncertainties are embedded in implicit and high-proportional undocumented
infections, asymptomatic contagion, social reinforcement of infections, and
various quality issues in the reported data. These uncertainties become even
more apparent in the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic, when the
relevant knowledge, case reporting and testing were all limited. Here we
introduce a novel hybrid approach Susceptible-Undocumented infected-Documented
infected-Recovered (SUDR) model. First, SUDR (1) characterizes and
distinguishes Undocumented (U) and Documented (D) infections commonly seen
during COVID-19 incubation periods and asymptomatic infections. Second, SUDR
characterizes the probabilistic density of infections by capturing exogenous
processes. Lastly, SUDR approximates the density likelihood of COVID-19
prevalence over time by incorporating Bayesian inference into SUDR. Different
from existing COVID-19 models, SUDR characterizes the undocumented infections
during unknown transmission processes. To capture the uncertainties of temporal
transmission and social reinforcement during COVID-19 contagion, the
transmission rate is modeled by a time-varying density function of undocumented
infectious cases. By sampling from the mean-field posterior distribution with
reasonable priors, SUDR handles the randomness, noise and sparsity of COVID-19
observations widely seen in the public COVID-19 case data. The results
demonstrate a deeper quantitative understanding of the above uncertainties, in
comparison with classic SIR, time-dependent SIR, and probabilistic SIR models.

can be divided into two sub-tasks: event type classification and element
extraction (namely identifying triggers and arguments under different role
patterns). As different event types always own distinct extraction schemas
(i.e., role patterns), previous work on EE usually follows an isolated learning
paradigm, performing element extraction independently for different event
types. It ignores meaningful associations among event types and argument roles,
leading to relatively poor performance for less frequent types/roles. This
paper proposes a novel neural association framework for the EE task. Given a
document, it first performs type classification via constructing a
document-level graph to associate sentence nodes of different types, and
adopting a graph attention network to learn sentence embeddings. Then, element
extraction is achieved by building a universal schema of argument roles, with a
parameter inheritance mechanism to enhance role preference for extracted
elements. As such, our model takes into account type and role associations
during EE, enabling implicit information sharing among them. Experimental
results show that our approach consistently outperforms most state-of-the-art
EE methods in both sub-tasks. Particularly, for types/roles with less training
data, the performance is superior to the existing methods.

three and no other number. By using Atomic Force Microscopy we obtained
high-resolution images of gp37 fibers adsorbed on mica substrate in buffer

its evolution by tuning two types of dipole couplings in the bulk. We further
introduce translational symmetry breaking complex scalar field, which is
assumed to couple with the holographic fermions. The symmetry breaking
background induced by the scalar field is known as Q-lattice. We calculate the
fermion spectral function, which captures the low energy behaviour of the

M17 using thermal dust polarization taken by SOFIA/HAWC+ centered at 154 $\mu$m
wavelength. Using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, we found the presence
of strong magnetic fields of $980 \pm 230\;\mu$G and $1665 \pm 885\;\mu$G in
lower-density (M17-N) and higher-density (M17-S) regions, respectively. The
magnetic field morphology in M17-N possibly mimics the fields in gravitational
collapse molecular cores while in M17-S the fields run perpendicular to the
matter structure and display a pillar and an asymmetric hourglass shape. The
mean values of the magnetic field strength are used to determine the Alfv\'enic
Mach numbers ($\mathcal{M_A}$) of M17-N and M17-S which turn out to be
sub-Alfv\'enic, or magnetic fields dominate turbulence. We calculate the
mass-to-flux ratio, $\lambda$, and obtain $\lambda=0.07$ for M17-N and $0.28$
for M17-S. The sub-critical values of $\lambda$ are in agreement with the lack
of massive stars formed in M17. To study dust physics, we analyze the
relationship between the dust polarization fraction, $p$, and the thermal
emission intensity, $I$, gas column density, $N({\rm H_2})$, and dust
temperature, $T_{\rm d}$. The polarization fraction decreases with intensity as
$I^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha = 0.51$. The polarization fraction also decreases
with increasing $N(\rm H_{2})$, which can be explained by the decrease of grain
alignment by radiative torques (RATs) toward denser regions with a weaker
radiation field and/or tangling of magnetic fields. The polarization fraction
tends to increase with $T_{\rm d}$ first and then decreases when $T_ {\rm d} >
50$ K. The latter feature seen in the M17-N, where the gas density changes
slowly with $T_{d}$, is consistent with the RAT disruption effect.

  Generalization",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the rapid increase in the diversity of image data, the problem of
domain generalization has received increased attention recently. While domain
generalization is a challenging problem, it has achieved great development
thanks to the fast development of AI techniques in computer vision. Most of
these advanced algorithms are proposed with deep architectures based on
convolution neural nets (CNN). However, though CNNs have a strong ability to
find the discriminative features, they do a poor job of modeling the relations
between different locations in the image due to the response to CNN filters are
mostly local. Since these local and global spatial relationships are
characterized to distinguish an object under consideration, they play a
critical role in improving the generalization ability against the domain gap.
In order to get the object parts relationships to gain better domain
generalization, this work proposes to use the self attention model. However,
the attention models are proposed for sequence, which are not expert in
discriminate feature extraction for 2D images. Considering this, we proposed a
hybrid architecture to discover the spatial relationships between these local
features, and derive a composite representation that encodes both the
discriminative features and their relationships to improve the domain
generalization. Evaluation on three well-known benchmarks demonstrates the
benefits of modeling relationships between the features of an image using the
proposed method and achieves state-of-the-art domain generalization
performance. More specifically, the proposed algorithm outperforms the
state-of-the-art by 2.2% and 3.4% on PACS and Office-Home databases,
respectively.

labeled data in medical classification tasks. Whereas finetuning a downstream
task using supervised ImageNet pretrained features is straightforward and
extensively investigated in many works, there is little study on the usefulness
of self-supervised pretraining. In this paper, we assess the transferability of
ImageNet self-supervisedpretraining by evaluating the performance of models
initialized with pretrained features from three self-supervised techniques
(SimCLR, SwAV, and DINO) on selected medical classification tasks. The chosen
tasks cover tumor detection in sentinel axillary lymph node images, diabetic
retinopathy classification in fundus images, and multiple pathological
condition classification in chest X-ray images. We demonstrate that
self-supervised pretrained models yield richer embeddings than their supervised
counterpart, which benefits downstream tasks in view of both linear evaluation
and finetuning. For example, in view of linear evaluation at acritically small
subset of the data, we see an improvement up to 14.79% in Kappa score in the
diabetic retinopathy classification task, 5.4% in AUC in the tumor
classification task, 7.03% AUC in the pneumonia detection, and 9.4% in AUC in
the detection of pathological conditions in chest X-ray. In addition, we
introduce Dynamic Visual Meta-Embedding (DVME) as an end-to-end transfer
learning approach that fuses pretrained embeddings from multiple models. We
show that the collective representation obtained by DVME leads to a significant
improvement in the performance of selected tasks compared to using a single
pretrained model approach and can be generalized to any combination of
pretrained models.

consist of only one pattern. We therefore explore the possibility to condition
on the number of points instead when fitting and validating spatial point

process models, we consider model validation using global envelope tests based
on functional summary statistics. We find that conditioning on the number of
points will for some functional summary statistics lead to more narrow
envelopes and that it can also be useful for correcting for some
conservativeness in the tests when testing composite hypothesis. However, for
other functional summary statistics, it makes little or no difference to
condition on the number of points. When estimating parameters in popular
spatial point process models, we conclude that for mathematical and
computational reasons it is convenient to assume a distribution for the number

additive shear bias, we show how unbiased shear estimates can be obtained from
the observed data alone. To do so, we exploit the finding that the
multiplicative shear bias obtained with MetaDetection is nearly insensitive to
the PSF ellipticity. In practice, this assumption can be validated by comparing
the empirical corrections obtained from observations to those from simulated

considered as an indicator of attention level. Participants repeated the task
in two sessions; in one session they received kinesthetic feedback and in
another session no feedback. Using their EEG signals, we trained three
attention classifiers; a support vector machine (SVM) using EEG spectral band
powers, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using either spectral features

always available: only 0.3% of the ~49M smart contracts that are currently
deployed on Ethereum have their source code publicly available. Moreover, since
contracts may call functions from other contracts, security flaws in
closed-source contracts may affect open-source contracts as well. However,
current state-of-the-art approaches that operate on closed-source contracts
(i.e., EVM bytecode), such as EVMPatch and SmartShield, make use of purely
hard-coded templates that leverage fix patching patterns. As a result, they
cannot dynamically adapt to the bytecode that is being patched, which severely
limits their flexibility and scalability. For instance, when patching integer
overflows using hard-coded templates, a particular patch template needs to be
employed as the bounds to be checked are different for each integer size. In
this paper, we propose Elysium, a scalable approach towards automatic smart
contract repair at the bytecode level. Elysium combines template-based and
semantic-based patching by inferring context information from bytecode. Elysium
is currently able to patch 7 different types of vulnerabilities in smart
contracts automatically and can easily be extended with new templates and new
bug-finding tools. We evaluate its effectiveness and correctness using 3
different datasets by replaying more than 500K transactions on patched
contracts. We find that Elysium outperforms existing tools by patching at least
30% more contracts correctly. Finally, we also compare the overhead of Elysium
in terms of deployment and transaction cost. In comparison to other tools, we
find that generally Elysium minimizes the runtime cost (i.e., transaction cost)
up to a factor of 1.7, for only a marginally higher deployment cost, where
deployment cost is a one-time cost as compared to the runtime cost.

excitation to drive superparamagnetic nanoparticles into the non-linear part of
their magnetization curve, which creates a spectrum with a clear separation of
direct feed-through and higher harmonics caused by the particles response. One
challenge for rectangular excitation is the discrimination of particle and

itself, as particles that are not placed at the same spatial position, may
react simultaneously and are not separable by their signal phase or shape. To
overcome this potential loss of information in spatial encoding for high

proposed in this work. Upon close view, a system matrix approach is capable to
maintain resolution, independent of the sequence, if the response to pulsed
sequences still encodes information within the phase. Data from an Arbitrary

values from a given finite set $\mathcal{M}\subset\mathbb{R}^m$. Such hybrid
discrete--continuous problems occur in, e.g., topology optimization or medical

circumvent this difficulty, we introduce as a regularization term a convex
integral functional with an integrand that has a polyhedral epigraph with
vertices corresponding to the values of $\mathcal{M}$; similar to the $L^1$
norm in sparse regularization, this ""vector multibang penalty"" promotes
solutions with the desired structure while allowing the use of tools from
convex optimization for the analysis as well as the numerical solution of the
resulting problem.
  We show well-posedness of the regularized problem and analyze stability
properties of its solution in a general setting. We then illustrate the
approach for three specific model optimization problems of broader interest:
optimal control of the Bloch equation, optimal control of an elastic
deformation, and a multimaterial branched transport problem. In the first two
cases, we derive explicit characterizations of the penalty and its generalized
derivatives for a concrete class of sets $\mathcal{M}$. For the third case, we
discuss the algorithmic computation of these derivatives for general sets.
These derivatives are then used in a superlinearly convergent semismooth Newton
method applied to a sequence of regularized optimization problems.

the dissipative character of generic non-linear diffusion equations is also
hard-coded in the functional RG equation. This renders RG flows manifestly
irreversible, revealing the semi-group property of RG transformations on the
level of the flow equation itself. Additionally, we argue that the dissipative
character of RG flows, its irreversibility and the entropy production during
the RG flow may be linked to the existence of a so-called
$\mathcal{C}$-/$\mathcal{A}$-function. In total, this introduces an asymmetry
in the so-called RG time -- in complete analogy to the thermodynamic arrow of
time -- and allows for an interpretation of infrared actions as equilibrium
solutions of dissipative RG flows equations. The impossibility of resolving
microphysics from macrophysics is evident in this framework. Furthermore, we
directly link the irreversibility and the entropy production in RG flows to an
explicit numerical entropy production, which is manifest in diffusive and
non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) and a standard mathematical
tool for the analysis of PDEs. Using exactly solvable zero-dimensional
$\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric models, we explicitly compute the (numerical) entropy
production related to the total variation non-increasing property of the PDE
during RG flows toward the infrared limit. Finally, we discuss generalizations

Through the mixing with the three doublet leptonic superfields, the non-zero
tiny neutrino masses can be generated through the inverse seesaw mechanism.
While $R$-parity is conserved in this model lepton number is explicitly
violated. We quantify the impact of the extended neutrino sector on the NMSSM
Higgs sector by computing the complete one-loop corrections with full momentum
dependence to the Higgs boson masses in a mixed on-shell-$\overline{\mbox{DR}}$
renormalization scheme, with and without the inclusion of CP violation. The
results are consistently combined with the dominant two-loop corrections at
${\cal O}(\alpha_t(\alpha_s+\alpha_t))$ to improve the predictions for the

the constraints from the Higgs data, the neutrino oscillation data, the charged
lepton flavor-violating decays $l_i \to l_j + \gamma$, and the new physics

women's lives will improve the effectiveness of interventions addressing gender
inequality, mainstream development institutions have invested heavily in gender
data initiatives of late. However, critical empirical and theoretical
investigations into gender data for development policy and practice are
lacking. Postcolonial feminist theory has long provided a critical lens through
which to analyse international development projects that target women in the
majority world. However, postcolonial feminism remains underutilised for
critically investigating data for development projects. This paper addresses
these gaps through presenting the findings from a participatory action research
project with young women involved in a gender data for development project in
Bangladesh. Echoing postcolonial feminist concerns with development, the
'DataGirls' had some concerns that data was being extracted from their
communities, representing the priorities of external NGOs to a greater extent
than their own. However, through collaborating to develop and deliver community
events on child marriage with the 'DataGirls', this research demonstrates that
participatory approaches can address some postcolonial feminist criticisms of
(data for) development, by ensuring that gender data is enacted by and for
majority world women rather than Western development institutions.

division duplex (FDD) massive MIMO can facilitate its backward compatibility
with existing FDD cellular networks. To date, several CSIT estimation schemes
have been proposed for FDD single-cell massive MIMO systems, but they fail to
consider inter-cell-interference (ICI) and suffer from downlink pilot
contamination in multi-cell scenario. To solve this problem, this paper
proposes a compressive sensing (CS)-based CSIT estimation scheme to combat ICI
in FDD multi-cell massive MIMO systems. Specifically, angle-domain massive MIMO
channels exhibit the common sparsity over different subcarriers, and such
sparsity is partially shared by adjacent users. By exploiting these sparsity
properties, we design the pilot signal and the associated channel estimation
algorithm under the framework of CS theory, where the channels associated with
multiple adjacent BSs can be reliably estimated with low training overhead for
downlink pilot decontamination. Simulation results verify the good downlink
pilot decontamination performance of the proposed solution compared to its
conventional counterparts in multi-cell FDD massive MIMO.

eddy diffusivity without explicitly accounting for the energetics of turbulent
eddies across scales. To address this gap, the turbulent flux of sediments is
derived using a co-spectral budget (CSB) model that can be imminently used in
SS and other fine particle transport models. The CSB closes the
pressure-redistribution effect using a spectral linear Rotta scheme modified to
include isotropoziation of production and interactions between turbulent eddies
and sediment grains through a modified scale-dependent de-correlation time. The
result is a formulation similar in complexity to the widely used Rouse's
equation but with all characteristic scales, Reynolds number, and Schmidt
number effects derived from well-established spectral shapes of the vertical
velocity and accepted constants from turbulence models. Finally, the proposed

parameterized convective heat transfer rocks in the interior of terrestrial

limited in the amount of physics they can model (e.g. depth dependent material
properties) and predict only mean quantities such as the mean mantle
temperature. We recently showed that feedforward neural networks (FNN) trained
using a large number of 2D simulations can overcome this limitation and
reliably predict the evolution of entire 1D laterally-averaged temperature
profile in time for complex models. We now extend that approach to predict the
full 2D temperature field, which contains more information in the form of
convection structures such as hot plumes and cold downwellings. Using a dataset
of 10,525 two-dimensional simulations of the thermal evolution of the mantle of
a Mars-like planet, we show that deep learning techniques can produce reliable
parameterized surrogates (i.e. surrogates that predict state variables such as
temperature based only on parameters) of the underlying partial differential
equations. We first use convolutional autoencoders to compress the temperature
fields by a factor of 142 and then use FNN and long-short term memory networks
(LSTM) to predict the compressed fields. On average, the FNN predictions are
99.30% and the LSTM predictions are 99.22% accurate with respect to unseen
simulations. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) of the LSTM and FNN
predictions shows that despite a lower mean absolute relative accuracy, LSTMs
capture the flow dynamics better than FNNs. When summed, the POD coefficients

existing area level random effect terms with CAR prior specification, whose
structure is changing over time. We name these models MLM tCARs for
longitudinal data. We compare the developed MLM tCARs to the classical
multilevel growth model via simulation studies in common spatial data
situations. The results indicate the better performance of the MLM tCARs, to
retrieve the true regression coefficients and with better fit in general.
  Secondly, this paper provides a comprehensive decision tree for analysing
data in epidemiological studies with spatially nested structure: we also
consider the Multilevel Conditional Autoregressive models for cross-sectional
studies (MLM CARs). We compare three models (for cross-sectional studies) via
simulation studies: the classical multilevel model, the multilevel CAR model
and the Restricted CAR model that accounts for spatial confounding. The MLM
CARs, particularly the Restricted CAR show better results. We apply the models
comparatively on the analysis of the association between greenness and
depressive symptoms in the longitudinal Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study. The results
show negative association between greenness and depression and a decreasing
linear individual time trend for all models. We observe very weak spatial
variation and moderate temporal autocorrelation.

the input node features, which vary across networks and applications. Selecting
appropriate node features remains application-dependent and generally an open
question. Moreover, owing to privacy and ethical issues, use of personalized
node features is often restricted. In fact, many publicly available data from
online social network do not contain any node features (e.g., demography). In
this work, we provide a comprehensive experimental analysis which shows that
harnessing a transductive technique (e.g., Node2Vec) for obtaining initial node
representations, after which an inductive node embedding technique takes over,
leads to substantial improvements in link prediction accuracy. We demonstrate
that, for a wide variety of GNN variants, node representation vectors obtained
from Node2Vec serve as high quality input features to GNNs, thereby improving

Furthermore, by separating the impurity locations into partitions arranged in a

investigated using a kernel-based Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model

is on the role of geographic spreaders defined here as a portion of the
infected population ($\phi$) experiencing high mobility between identical
communities. The spatial organization of the infected population and invasive
front speeds ($c_{max}$) are determined when the infections are randomly
initiated in space within multiple communities. For small but finite $\phi$,
scaling analysis in 1-dimension and simulation results in 2-dimensions suggest
that $c_{max}\sim (1-\phi) \gamma (R_o-1) \sigma$, where $\gamma$ is the
inverse of the infectious duration, and $\sigma^2$ is the variance of the
spatial kernel describing mobility of long-distance spreaders across
communities. Hence, $c_{max}$ is not significantly affected by the small $\phi$
though reductions in $\phi$ act as retardation factors to the attainment of
$c_{max}$. The $\sigma$ determines the spatial organization of infections
across communities. When $\sigma >5dr$ (long-distance mobility, where $dr$ is
the minimum spatial extent defining adjacent communities), the infectious
population will experience a transient but spatially coherent pattern with a
wavelength that can be derived from the spreading kernel properties.

sketching technique, namely Frequent Directions, for constructing an efficient

the tensor Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD). Specifically, the new
algorithm allows the tensor data to be observed slice by slice, but only needs
to maintain and incrementally update a much smaller sketch which could capture
the principal information of the original tensor. The rigorous theoretical
analysis shows that the approximation error of the new algorithm can be
arbitrarily small when the sketch size grows linearly. Extensive experimental
results on both synthetic and real multi-dimensional data further reveal the
superiority of the proposed algorithm compared with other sketching algorithms
for getting low-tubal-rank approximation, in terms of both efficiency and

administrators (DBAs) who are expected to identify and supply representative
training workloads. Even the latest advancements like query stores provide only
limited support for dynamic environments. This status quo is untenable:
identifying representative static workloads is no longer realistic; and
physical design tools remain susceptible to the query optimiser's cost
misestimates. Furthermore, modern application environments such as hybrid
transactional and analytical processing (HTAP) systems render analytical
modelling next to impossible.
  We propose a self-driving approach to online index selection that eschews the

through strategic exploration and direct performance observation. We view the
problem as one of sequential decision making under uncertainty, specifically

applying quality cuts on the data acquired. These cuts, optimized using Monte
Carlo simulations, select higher quality events from the initial dataset.
Subsequent steps of the analysis typically use the surviving events to
calculate one set of instrument response functions (IRFs). An alternative
approach is the use of event types, as implemented in experiments such as the
Fermi-LAT. In this approach, events are divided into sub-samples based on their
reconstruction quality, and a set of IRFs is calculated for each sub-sample.
The sub-samples are then combined in a joint analysis, treating them as
independent observations. This leads to an improvement in performance
parameters such as sensitivity, angular and energy resolution. Data loss is
reduced since lower quality events are included in the analysis as well, rather
than discarded. In this study, machine learning methods will be used to
classify events according to their expected angular reconstruction quality. We

and solar power to ensure significant reduction of the thawing layer (to 20 cm
order). We have performed calculations for the broad range of permafrost
conditions to compare traditional methods for thermal stabilization and their
combination to the suggested concept. The latter only has ensured minimum
thawing layer over summer even at the southern edge of permafrost extent. The
importance of minimum thawing layer is discussed in terms of chemical and
biological safety in the area of human activities. The layout for glaciers
protection has also been considered. Estimated cost of the concept

thermosyphons while providing much better technical performance and unique
possibilities for revenue by selling (not wasting) heat and excessive

around - a clearly unphysical result. In this Letter we demonstrate that the
use of single-temperature blackbody functions results in the systematic
underestimation of TDE accretion disc sizes by as much as an
order-of-magnitude. In fact, the radial `size' inferred from fitting a single
temperature blackbody to an observed accretion disc X-ray spectrum does not
even positively correlate with the physical size of that accretion disc. We
further demonstrate that the disc-observer inclination angle and absorption of
X-ray photons may both lead to additional underestimation of the radial sizes
of TDE discs, but by smaller factors. To rectify these issues we present a new
fitting function which accurately reproduces the size of an accretion disc from
its 0.3-10 keV X-ray spectrum. Unlike traditional approaches, this new fitting
function does not assume that the accretion disc has reached a steady state
configuration, an assumption which is unlikely to be satisfied by most TDEs. An

In particular, we show that the unusual soft variability first detected by

suppression of the variance at 1 keV by photoionised emission, which makes the
variance below 1 keV appear more extreme. We also examine the variability on
long timescales, between observations, and find that it is well described by a
combination of intrinsic variability and absorption variability. We suggest
that the typical extreme high frequency variability which 1H 0707-495 is known
for is intrinsic to the source, but the large amplitude, low frequency
variability that causes prolonged low-flux intervals is likely dominated by
variable low-ionisation, low velocity absorption.

method utilizes nanoparticle-on-foil (NPoF) nanocavities supporting both

trap intense MIR surface plasmons within the Reststrahlen band, tuning the
visible-wavelength localized plasmons by reversibly perturbing the

define a class of multivariate point processes via their corresponding

Essentially, there is a jump in an intensity process whenever the corresponding
point process records an event. An attribute of our modelling class is that not
only a jump is recorded at each instance, but also its magnitude. This allows
large jumps to influence the intensity to a larger degree than smaller jumps.
We give conditions which guarantee that the process is stable, in the sense
that it does not explode, and provide a detailed discussion on when the
subclass of linear models is stable. Finally, we fit our model to financial
time series data from the S\&P 500 and Nikkei 225 indices respectively. We
conclude that a nonlinear variant from our modelling class fits the data best.
This supports the observation that in times of crises (high intensity) jumps
tend to arrive in clusters, whereas there are typically longer times between
jumps when the markets are calmer. We moreover observe more variability in jump
sizes when the intensity is high, than when it is low.

the late stage of the black hole evaporation, the decoupling between early and

black hole evaporation and the situation that the information paradox has put

hole's spin relative to the orbital angular momentum vector of the binary, and
the implications for the physical processes that determine this tilt. The
posterior tilt distributions of GW200115 and the candidate events
GW190426_152155 and GW190917_114630 peak at significantly anti-aligned
orientations (though display wide distributions). Producing these tilts through
isolated binary evolution would require stronger natal kicks than are typically
considered (and preferentially-polar kicks would be ruled out), and/or an
additional source of tilt such as stable mass transfer. The early sample of
NS-BH events are less massive than expected for classical formation channels,
and may provide evidence for efficient mass transfer that results in the merger
of more massive NS-BH binaries before their evolution to the compact phase is
complete. We predict that future gravitational-wave detections of NS-BH events
will continue to display total binary masses of $\approx 7$ M$_{\odot}$ and
mass ratios of $q \sim 3$ if this interpretation is correct. Conversely, the
high mass of the candidate GW191219_163120 suggests a dynamical capture origin.
Large tilts in a significant fraction of merging NS-BH systems would weaken the
prospects for electromagnetic detection. However, EM observations, including
non-detections, can significantly tighten the constraints on spin and mass
ratio.

Similar discoveries have been made around additional galaxies in the local
Universe such as Andromeda, Centaurus A, and potentially M83. In the specific
cases with available kinematic data, the dwarf satellites also appear to
preferentially co-orbit their massive host galaxy. Planes of satellites are
rare in the lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) paradigm, although they may
be a natural consequence of projection effects. Such a phase-space correlation,
however, remains difficult to explain. In this work we analyzed the 2D spatial
distribution of 2210 dwarf galaxies around early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the
low-to-medium density fields of the ""Mass Assembly of early-Type GaLAxies with

flattened dwarf structures using a combination of both methods with subsequent
Monte Carlo (MC) simulations with random data. The vast majority of these dwarf
structures lie within the estimated virial radii of the massive host. The major
axes of these systems are aligned better than 30{\deg} with the estimated

algorithmic graph theory. For instance, the minimum cut, the minimum $s$-$t$
cut, the minimum multiway cut, and the minimum $k$-way cut are some of the
commonly encountered cut problems. Many of these problems have been extensively
studied over several decades. In this paper, we initiate the algorithmic study
of some cut problems in high dimensions.
  The first problem we study, namely, Topological Hitting Set (THS), is defined
as follows: Given a nontrivial $r$-cycle $\zeta$ in a simplicial complex
$\mathsf{K}$, find a set $\mathcal{S}$ of $r$-dimensional simplices of minimum
cardinality so that $\mathcal{S}$ meets every cycle homologous to $\zeta$. Our
main result is that this problem admits a polynomial-time solution on
triangulations of closed surfaces. Interestingly, the optimal solution is given
in terms of the cocycles of the surface. For general complexes, we show that
THS is W[1]-hard with respect to the solution size $k$. On the positive side,
we show that THS admits an FPT algorithm with respect to $k+d$, where $d$ is
the maximum degree of the Hasse graph of the complex $\mathsf{K}$.
  We also define a problem called Boundary Nontrivialization (BNT): Given a
bounding $r$-cycle $\zeta$ in a simplicial complex $\mathsf{K}$, find a set
$\mathcal{S}$ of $(r+1)$-dimensional simplices of minimum cardinality so that
the removal of $\mathcal{S}$ from $\mathsf{K}$ makes $\zeta$ non-bounding. We
show that BNT is W[1]-hard with respect to the solution size as the parameter,
and has an $O(\log n)$-approximation FPT algorithm for $(r+1)$-dimensional
complexes with the $(r+1)$-th Betti number $\beta_{r+1}$ as the parameter.
Finally, we provide randomized (approximation) FPT algorithms for the global
variants of THS and BNT.

each system. We then used Bayesian model comparison on all targets to get a
robust estimate of the number of planets per star. We did this using the nested
sampling algorithm PolyChord. For some targets, we also compared different
noise models to disentangle planetary signatures from stellar activity. Lastly,
we ran an efficient MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) algorithm for each target
to get reliable estimates for the planets' orbital parameters. Results. We
identify 12 planets within several multiplanet systems. These planets are all
in the super-Earth and sub-Neptune mass regime with minimum masses ranging
between 4 and 13 M$_\oplus$ and orbital periods between 5 and 103 days. Three
of these planets are new, namely HD 93385 b, HD 96700 c, and HD 189567 c.

frameworks. For example, metric-affine and generalized geometries can be
written on Lie and Courant algebroids, respectively. Furthermore, string
theories might make use of many other algebroids such as metric algebroids,
higher-Courant algebroids, or conformal Courant algebroids. Working on the
possibly most general algebroid structure is fruitful as it creates a chance to
study all of them at once. Local pre-Leibniz algebroids are such general ones
in which metric-connection geometries are possible to construct. Yet, the
existence of the locality operator necessitates the modification of torsion and
curvature operators to achieve tensorial quantities. In this paper, this
modification is explained from the point of view that the modification is
applied to the bracket instead. This leads one to consider `anti-commutable'
pre-Leibniz algebroids whose bracket satisfies a property defined with respect
to a choice of an equivalence class of connections. These `admissible'
connections are claimed to be the necessary ones for a geometry on algebroids
because one can prove many desirable properties for them. For instance, we
prove the first and second Bianchi identities, Ricci identity, Cartan structure
equations, the construction of Levi-Civita connections, the decomposition of
connection in terms of torsion and non-metricity. These all are possible
because the modified bracket becomes anti-symmetric for an admissible
connection so that one can apply the machinery of almost- or pre-Lie
algebroids. We investigate various algebroid structures from the literature and
show that they admit admissible connections which are metric-compatible in some
generalized sense. Moreover, we prove that local pre-Leibniz algebroids that
are not anti-commutable cannot be equipped with a torsion-free, and in
particular Levi-Civita, connection.

for every $t \leq K$, it outputs at least $t$ solutions in time $O(tp)$, where
$p$ is the incremental delay of the algorithm. While it is folklore that one
can transform such an algorithm into an algorithm with delay $O(p)$, the naive
transformation may blow the space exponentially. We show that, using geometric
amortization, such an algorithm can be transformed into an algorithm with delay
$O(p\log K)$ and $O(s\log K)$ space, where $s$ is the space used by the

sleep staging in adults, it is currently unknown if the most advanced
algorithms generalize to the pediatric population, which displays distinctive
characteristics in overnight polysomnography (PSG). Methods: To answer the
question, in this work, we conduct a large-scale comparative study on the
state-of-the-art deep learning methods for pediatric automatic sleep staging.
Six different deep neural networks with diverging features are adopted to
evaluate a sample of more than 1,200 children across a wide spectrum of
obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) severity. Results: Our experimental results show
that the individual performance of automated pediatric sleep stagers when
evaluated on new subjects is equivalent to the expert-level one reported on
adults. Combining the six stagers into ensemble models further boosts the
staging accuracy, reaching an overall accuracy of 88.8%, a Cohen's kappa of
0.852, and a macro F1-score of 85.8%. At the same time, the ensemble models
lead to reduced predictive uncertainty. The results also show that the studied
algorithms and their ensembles are robust to concept drift when the training
and test data were recorded seven months apart and after clinical intervention.
Conclusion: However, we show that the improvements in the staging performance
are not necessarily clinically significant although the ensemble models lead to
more favorable clinical measures than the six standalone models. Significance:
Detailed analyses further demonstrate ""almost perfect"" agreement between the
automatic stagers to one another and their similar patterns on the staging
errors, suggesting little room for improvement.

simulations to investigate the effects of absorption systems on the
reionization process, especially their impacts on the neutral islands during

extreme case of no-SSA model with a high level of ionizing background, the
moderate-SSA model with a relatively high level of ionizing background, and the
dense-SSA model with a low level of ionizing background. We find that while the
characteristic scale of neutral regions decreases during the early and middle
stages of reionization, it stays nearly unchanged at about 10 comoving Mpc
during the late stage for the no-SSA and moderate-SSA models. However, in the
case of weak ionizing background in the dense-SSA model, the characteristic
island scale shows obvious evolution, as large islands break into many small
ones that are slowly ionized. The evolutionary behavior of neutral islands
during the late EoR thus provides a novel way to constrain the abundance of
SSAs. We discuss the 21-cm observation with the upcoming Square Kilometre

Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) have been experiencing declining financial
performance which deters investors from investing in such firms. The lenders
are also not willing to lend to such firms. As such, the firms struggle to
raise funds for their operations. Prudent financing decisions can lead to
financial growth of the firm. The purpose of this study is to assess the effect
of Share capital on financial growth of Non-financial firms listed at the
Nairobi Securities Exchange. Financial firms were excluded because of their
specific sector characteristics and stringent regulatory framework. The study
is guided by Market Timing Theory and Theory of Growth of the Firm.
Methodology: Explanatory research design was adopted. The target population of
the study comprised of 45 non-financial firms listed at NSE for a period of ten
years from 2008 to 2017. The study conducted both descriptive statistics
analysis and panel data analysis. Findings: The result indicates that, share
capital explains 32.73% and 11.62% of variations in financial growth as measure
by growth in earnings per share and growth in market capitalization
respectively. Share capital positively and significantly influences financial
growth as measured by both growth in earnings per share and growth in market
capitalization. Implications: The study recommends for the Non-financial firms
to utilize equity financing as a way of raising capital for major expansions,
asset growth or acquisitions which may require heavy funding. In this way,
firms will be assured of improved performance as well as high financial growth.
The study also recommends for substantial firm financing through equity. Value:
Equity financing is important to any firm, if the proceeds are used to invest
in projects which eventually bring growth to the firm.

augments the tensor by weighted sampling of entity importances and a value

that the method works very competitively against other well known modifications

  In this paper, we resolve the convergence guarantee issue by proposing a
modification of New Q-Newton's method, named New Q-Newton's method
Backtracking, which incorporates a more sophisticated use of hyperparameters
and a Backtracking line search. This new method has very good theoretical
guarantees, which for a {\bf Morse function} yields the following (which is
unknown for New Q-Newton's method):
  {\bf Theorem.} Let $f:\mathbb{R}^m\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a Morse
function, that is all its critical points have invertible Hessian. Then for a
sequence $\{x_n\}$ constructed by New Q-Newton's method Backtracking from a
random initial point $x_0$, we have the following two alternatives:
  i) $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}||x_n||=\infty$,
  or
  ii) $\{x_n\}$ converges to a point $x_{\infty}$ which is a {\bf local
minimum} of $f$, and the rate of convergence is {\bf quadratic}.
  Moreover, if $f$ has compact sublevels, then only case ii) happens.
  As far as we know, for Morse functions, this is the best theoretical
guarantee for iterative optimization algorithms so far in the literature. We
have tested in experiments on small scale, with some further simplified
versions of New Q-Newton's method Backtracking, and found that the new method
significantly improve New Q-Newton's method.

In this paper, we present a novel study analyzing the weaknesses in the

images and use it to add imperceptible adversarial perturbations to images to

motivated the development of Federated Learning (FL), a framework for on-device
collaborative training of machine learning models. First efforts in FL focused
on learning a single global model with good average performance across clients,
but the global model may be arbitrarily bad for a given client, due to the
inherent heterogeneity of local data distributions. Federated multi-task
learning (MTL) approaches can learn personalized models by formulating an
opportune penalized optimization problem. The penalization term can capture
complex relations among personalized models, but eschews clear statistical
assumptions about local data distributions. In this work, we propose to study
federated MTL under the flexible assumption that each local data distribution
is a mixture of unknown underlying distributions. This assumption encompasses
most of the existing personalized FL approaches and leads to federated EM-like
algorithms for both client-server and fully decentralized settings. Moreover,
it provides a principled way to serve personalized models to clients not seen
at training time. The algorithms' convergence is analyzed through a novel
federated surrogate optimization framework, which can be of general interest.
Experimental results on FL benchmarks show that our approach provides models
with higher accuracy and fairness than state-of-the-art methods.

systems. As programming languages, proof assistants offer standard modularity
mechanisms such as first-class functions, type polymorphism and modules. As
logical systems, however, modularity is lacking, and understandably so:
incompatible reasoning principles -- such as univalence and uniqueness of
identity proofs -- can indirectly lead to logical inconsistency when used in a
given development, even when they appear to be confined to different modules.
The lack of logical modularity in proof assistants also hinders the adoption of
richer programming constructs, such as effects. We propose the multiverse, a
general type-theoretic approach to endow proof assistants with logical
modularity. The multiverse consists of multiple universe hierarchies that
statically describe the reasoning principles and effects available to define a
term at a given type. We identify sufficient conditions for this structuring to
modularly ensure that incompatible principles do not interfere, and to locally
restrict the power of dependent elimination when necessary. This extensible
approach generalizes the ad-hoc treatment of the sort of propositions in the

the inclusion of Coq-style propositions, the strict propositions of Gilbert et

Previous works on refining 3D proposals have relied on human-designed
components such as keypoints sampling, set abstraction and multi-scale feature
fusion to produce powerful 3D object representations. Such methods, however,
have limited ability to capture rich contextual dependencies among points. In
this paper, we leverage the high-quality region proposal network and a
Channel-wise Transformer architecture to constitute our two-stage 3D object

simultaneously performs proposal-aware embedding and channel-wise context
aggregation for the point features within each proposal. Specifically, CT3D
uses proposal's keypoints for spatial contextual modelling and learns attention
propagation in the encoding module, mapping the proposal to point embeddings.
Next, a new channel-wise decoding module enriches the query-key interaction via
channel-wise re-weighting to effectively merge multi-level contexts, which
contributes to more accurate object predictions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our CT3D method has superior performance and excellent
scalability. Remarkably, CT3D achieves the AP of 81.77% in the moderate car

transaction data and suddenly released events are all essential for
understanding trading market. However, most of the previous methods only take
the fluctuation information of the past few weeks into consideration, thus
yielding poor performance. To handle this issue, we propose a graphbased
approach that can incorporate multi-view information, i.e., long-term stock

the corona that is the hot gas that lies close to the accretion disk. The
temperature of the corona can be accurately determined by the cut-off signature
in the X-ray spectrum. Owing to the large temperatures of the corona,
observations well above 10 keV are necessary. Here, we explore the NuSTAR
observations of 118 Gehrels/Swift selected Seyfert 1 AGN. We model the spectrum
using a single power-law with an exponential cut-off modified by neutral and
ionised absorption as well as a reflection component. We find secure spectral
cut-off estimates in 62 sources while for the remaining ones we derive only
lower limits. The mean value is 103 keV with a skewed distribution towards
large energies with large dispersion. When we consider the lower limits using
survival analysis techniques, the mean cut-off energy becomes significantly
larger, about 200 keV. Because of various limitations (e.g. limited spectral
passband, photon statistics, model degeneracies) we perform extensive
simulations to explore the underlying spectral cut-off distribution. We find
that an intrinsic spectral cut-off distribution which has a Maxwell-Boltzmann
shape with a mean value in the range of 160 - 200 keV can reproduce
sufficiently well the observations. Finally, our spectral analysis places very
stringent constraints on both the photon index (Gamma=1.77+/-0.01) as well as
on the reflection component (R=0.69+/-0.04) of the Seyfert 1 population. From
the values of the spectral cut-off and the photon-index we deduce that the mean
optical depth of the AGN corona is approximately tau=1.82+/-0.14 and its mean
temperature approximately kT=65+/-10 keV.

this paper outlines a study to estimate the impact of scholarly citations that
female IS academics accumulate vis-\`a-vis their male colleagues. Drawing on a
scientometric study of the 7,260 papers published in the most prestigious IS
journals (known as the AIS Basket of Eight), our analysis aims to unveil
potential bias in the accumulation of citations between genders in the field.
We use panel regression to estimate the gendered citations accumulation in the

gender bias in academia, which is, so far, almost completely unexplored in the

  using MLIR: Some Early Results",,,,,"cs.DC cs.PF","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This report presents some early results on code generation targeting tensor
cores on NVIDIA GPUs using the MLIR compiler infrastructure. The
state-of-the-art in high-performance deep learning today is primarily driven by
manually optimized highly tuned libraries. The approach to develop such
libraries is often not modular or reusable to the same extent that compiler
infrastructure like LLVM is. Manual optimization typically does not use a
standard intermediate representation (IR), although the optimizations performed
can be encoded as a sequence of transformation steps and customized passes on
an IR. Hand tuning may also miss exploration of design points only reachable
easily by automatic code generation. We believe that until the recent
introduction of MLIR (Multi-level intermediate representation), IR
infrastructure was not geared to tackle the problem of automatic generation of
domain-specific libraries in an effective manner. In particular, it was hard to
represent and transform compute abstractions at high, middle, and low levels
using a single IR.
  With suitable abstractions in MLIR, we build an experimental lowering
pipeline that is able to automatically generate code for matrix-matrix
multiplication on NVIDIA GPUs targeting its tensor cores. On a set of problem
sizes we evaluated, initial performance results show that we are able to attain
performance that is 95-119% and 80-160% of CuBLAS for FP32 and FP16 accumulate
respectively on NVIDIA's Ampere microarchitecture-based Geforce 3090 RTX. We
believe that these results could be used as motivation for further research and
development on automatic code and library generation using IR infrastructure
for similar specialized accelerators.

many promising applications. Previous valley boundary transport relies on kink
states at internal boundaries between two topologically distinct domains.
However, recent studies have revealed a novel class of topological chiral edge
states (CESs) at external boundaries of valley materials, which have remained
elusive in photonics. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the
topological CESs in valley photonic metamaterials (VPMMs) by accurately tuning
on-site edge potentials. Moreover, the VPMMs work at deep-subwavelength scales.
Thus, the supported CESs are highly confined and self-guiding without relying
on a cladding layer to prevent leakage radiation. Via direct near-field
measurements, we observe the bulk bandgap, the edge dispersions, and the robust
edge transport passing through sharp corners, which are hallmarks of the CESs.
Our work paves a way to explore novel topological edge states in valley
photonics and sheds light on robust and miniaturized photonic devices.
