Reionization (EoR) is expected to suppress Ly$\alpha$ emission with
damping-wing absorption, causing nearly no Ly$\alpha$ detection from
star-forming galaxies at $z{\sim}8$. However, spectroscopic observations of the
4 brightest galaxies (${\rm H}_{160}{\sim}25$ mag) at these redshifts do reveal
prominent Ly$\alpha$ line, suggesting locally ionised IGM. In this paper, we
explore the Ly$\alpha$ IGM transmission and environment of bright galaxies
during the EoR using the Meraxes semi-analytic model. We find brighter galaxies
to be less affected by damping-wing absorption as they are effective at
ionizing surrounding neutral hydrogen. Specifically, the brightest sources
(${\rm H}_{160}{\lesssim}25.5$ mag) lie in the largest ionized regions in our
simulation, and have low attenuation of their Ly$\alpha$ from the IGM (optical
depth ${<}1$). Fainter galaxies (25.5 mag${<}{\rm H}_{160}{<}27.5$ mag) have
transmission that depends on UV luminosity, leading to a lower incidence of
Ly$\alpha$ detection at fainter magnitudes. This luminosity-dependent
attenuation explains why Ly$\alpha$ has only been observed in the brightest
galaxies at $z{\sim}8$. Follow-up observations have revealed counterparts in
the vicinity of these confirmed $z{\sim}8$ Ly$\alpha$ emitters. The
environments of our modelled analogues agree with these observations in the
number of nearby galaxies, which is a good indicator of whether Ly$\alpha$ can
be detected among fainter galaxies. At the current observational limit,
galaxies with ${\ge}2$--5 neighbours within $2'{\times}2'$ are ${\sim}2$--3
times more likely to show Ly$\alpha$ emission. JWST will discover an order of
magnitude more neighbours, revealing ${\gtrsim}50$ galaxies in the largest
ionizing bubbles and facilitating direct study of reionization morphology.

simulations also suggest that episodic variations in the terrestrial orbital
eccentricity may have caused bulk escape of co-orbitals, though variations
large enough ($>$0.01) to generate such episodes are statistically unlikely. We
then consider the orbital evolution of co-orbital asteroids of sizes down to $D

asteroids arriving via outward Yarkovsky drift, as conjectured by Zhou et
al.~(A\&A, 622, A97, 2019). We find this is an inefficient process, as
planetary close encounters rapidly scatter the orbits far from Earth's and
towards the asteroid belt. Finally, we discuss how the destabilising action of
Yarkovsky may be mitigated through spin state evolution or late collisional
comminution of large parent asteroids.

limited information available makes it an extremely challenging task. Most
previous best-performing methods adopt matching-based transductive reasoning or
online inductive learning. Nevertheless, they are either less discriminative

consists of two functional branches. The transduction branch adopts a
lightweight transformer architecture to aggregate rich spatio-temporal cues
while the induction branch performs online inductive learning to obtain
discriminative target information. To bridge these two diverse branches, a
two-head label encoder is introduced to learn the suitable target prior for
each of them. The generated mask encodings are further forced to be
disentangled to better retain their complementarity. Extensive experiments on
several prevalent benchmarks show that, without the need of synthetic training

is noticed in comparison to that of at the valence band maximum (VBM). Notably,

model the influence of the electrolyte layer thickness on the maximum
achievable solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of a device with an Si bottom cell and
show how the top absorber bandgap has to be adapted to minimise efficiency
losses. Then, the contrary effects of increasing ohmic and transport losses
with decreasing electrolyte layer thickness are evaluated. This allows us to
estimate an optimum electrolyte layer thickness range that counterbalances the
effects of parasitic absorption and ohmic/transport losses. We show that
fine-tuning of the top absorber bandgap and the water layer thickness can lead
to an STH efficiency increase of up to 1\% absolute. Our results allow us to
propose important design rules for high-efficiency photoelectrochemical devices

interpret the meanings of colors in information visualizations. Previous work
has suggested such effects are limited to concepts that have strong, specific
associations with colors. However, although a concept may not be strongly
associated with any colors, its mapping can be disambiguated in the context of
other concepts in an encoding system. We articulate this view in semantic
discriminability theory, a general framework for understanding conditions
determining when people can infer meaning from perceptual features. Semantic
discriminability is the degree to which observers can infer a unique mapping
between visual features and concepts. Semantic discriminability theory posits
that the capacity for semantic discriminability for a set of concepts is
constrained by the difference between the feature-concept association
distributions across the concepts in the set. We define formal properties of
this theory and test its implications in two experiments. The results show that
the capacity to produce semantically discriminable colors for sets of concepts
was indeed constrained by the statistical distance between color-concept
association distributions (Experiment 1). Moreover, people could interpret
meanings of colors in bar graphs insofar as the colors were semantically
discriminable, even for concepts previously considered ""non-colorable""
(Experiment 2). The results suggest that colors are more robust for visual
communication than previously thought.

$\delta_{3}\sim\left(0.22, 0.34\right)$. The $Z\leq2$ species obtain a looser

Besides, both the light and heavy nuclei indicate a consistent diffusion slope

significant disagreements exist between the heavy and light elements. The B/C

together with the existence of sporadic extended opaque Gunn-Peterson troughs,
has started to provide robust evidence for a late end of hydrogen reionisation.
However, low data quality and systematic uncertainties complicate the use of
Ly-$\alpha$ transmission as a precision probe of reionisation's end stages. In
this paper, we assemble a sample of 67 quasar sightlines at $z>5.5$ with high
signal-to-noise ratios of $>10$ per $\leq 15$ km s$^{-1}$ spectral pixel,
relying largely on the new XQR-30 quasar sample. XQR-30 is a large program on
VLT/X-Shooter which obtained deep (SNR $>20$ per pixel) spectra of 30 quasars
at $z>5.7$. We carefully account for systematics in continuum reconstruction,
instrumentation, and contamination by damped Ly-$\alpha$ systems. We present
improved measurements of the mean Ly-$\alpha$ transmission over $4.9<z<6.1$.
Using all known systematics in a forward modelling analysis, we find excellent
agreement between the observed Ly-$\alpha$ transmission distributions and the
homogeneous-UVB simulations Sherwood and Nyx up to $z\leq5.2$ ($<1 \sigma$),
and mild tension ($\sim 2.5 \sigma$) at $z=5.3$. Homogeneous UVB models are
ruled out by excess Ly-$\alpha$ transmission scatter at $z\geq5.4$ with high
confidence ($>3.5 \sigma$). Our results indicate that reionisation-related
fluctuations, whether in the UVB, residual neutral hydrogen fraction, and/or
IGM temperature, persist in the intergalactic medium until at least $z=5.3$
($t=1.1$ Gyr after the Big Bang). This is further evidence for a late end to
reionisation.

visual-semantic aligned representation learning (ViSA). ViSA leverages massive
image-caption pairs as weak image-level (not instance-level) supervision to
learn a rich cross-modal semantic space where the representations of visual
instances (not images) and those of textual queries are aligned, thus allowing
us to measure the similarities between any visual instance and an arbitrary

extensive experiments on the two datasets, we demonstrate ViSA's ability to
search for visual instances in images not available during training given a

  under Demand Uncertainties",,,,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  One of the most important aspects of moving forward to the next generation
networks like 5G/6G, is to enable network slicing in an efficient manner. The
most challenging issues are the uncertainties in computation and communication
demand. Because the slices' arrive to the network in different times and their
lifespans vary, the solution should dynamically react to online slice requests.
The joint problem of online admission control and resource allocation
considering the energy consumption is formulated mathematically. It is based on
Binary Linear Programming (BLP), where, the $\Gamma$-Robustness concept is
exploited to overcome Virtual Links (VL) bandwidths' and Virtual Network
Functions (VNF) workloads' uncertainties. Then, an optimal algorithm is
proposed. This optimal algorithm cannot be solved in a reasonable amount of
time for real-world and large-scale networks. To find near-optimal solution
efficiently, a new heuristic algorithm is developed. The assessments' results
indicate that the efficiency of heuristic is vital in increasing the accepted
requests' count, decreasing power consumption and providing adjustable
tolerance vs. the VNFs workloads' and VLs traffics' uncertainties, separately.
Considering the acceptance ratio and power consumption that constitute the two
important components of the objective function, heuristic has about 7% and 10%
optimality gaps, respectively, while being about 30X faster than that of
optimal algorithm.

using Koopman-operator methods. Given a dictionary of functions, these methods
approximate the projection of the action of the operator on the
finite-dimensional subspace spanned by the dictionary. We propose the Tunable
Symmetric Subspace Decomposition algorithm to refine the dictionary, balancing
its expressiveness and accuracy. Expressiveness corresponds to the ability of
the dictionary to describe the evolution of as many observables as possible and
accuracy corresponds to the ability to correctly predict their evolution. Based
on the observation that Koopman-invariant subspaces give rise to exact
predictions, we reason that prediction accuracy is a function of the degree of
invariance of the subspace generated by the dictionary and provide a
data-driven measure to measure invariance proximity. The proposed algorithm
iteratively prunes the initial functional space to identify a refined
dictionary of functions that satisfies the desired level of accuracy while
retaining as much of the original expressiveness as possible. We provide a full
characterization of the algorithm properties and show that it generalizes both
Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition and Symmetric Subspace Decomposition.
Simulations on planar systems show the effectiveness of the proposed methods in
producing Koopman approximations of tunable accuracy that capture relevant

applications are canonical challenges in Computer Science. The difficulty of
finding quality labels for problem instances holds back leveraging supervised
learning across combinatorial problems. Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms
have recently been adopted to solve this challenge automatically. The
underlying principle of this approach is to deploy a graph neural network (GNN)
for encoding both the local information of the nodes and the graph-structured
data in order to capture the current state of the environment. Then, it is
followed by the actor to learn the problem-specific heuristics on its own and
make an informed decision at each state for finally reaching a good solution.
Recent studies on this subject mainly focus on a family of combinatorial
problems on the graph, such as the travel salesman problem, where the proposed
model aims to find an ordering of vertices that optimizes a given objective
function. We use the security-aware phone clone allocation in the cloud as a
classical quadratic assignment problem (QAP) to investigate whether or not deep
RL-based model is generally applicable to solve other classes of such hard
problems. Extensive empirical evaluation shows that existing RL-based model may
not generalize to QAP.

for future information technologies. While demagnetisation in ferromagnets is
governed by dissipation of angular momentum, materials with multiple spin
sublattices, e.g. antiferromagnets, can allow direct angular momentum transfer
between opposing spins, promising faster functionality. In lanthanides,
4$\it{f}$ magnetic exchange is mediated indirectly through the conduction
electrons (the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction, RKKY), and the effect
of such conditions on direct spin transfer processes is largely unexplored.
Here, we investigate ultrafast magnetization dynamics in 4f antiferromagnets,
and systematically vary the 4$\it{f}$ occupation, thereby altering the
magnitude of RKKY. By combining time-resolved soft x-ray diffraction with
ab-initio calculations, we find that the rate of direct transfer between
opposing moments is directly determined by the magnitude of RKKY. Given the
high sensitivity of RKKY to the conduction electrons, our results offer a novel
approach for fine-tuning the speed of magnetic devices.

work is to introduce a new approach for the Riemann hypothesis by studying the
way pairs of consecutive zeros of $\zeta_N(s)$ change with respect to $N$. For
the initial stage, it is known that the non-trivial zeros of $\zeta_1(s)$ all
lie on the critical line $Re(s)=\frac{1}{2}$. In the region $2N \leq Im(s) \leq
2 \pi (N+1)$ the function $\zeta_N(s)$ serves as an approximation of $\zeta(s)$
itself, and it was conjectured by Spira that in this region $\zeta_N(s)$ also
admits zeros only on the critical line. We show that the appearance of zeros of
a section off the critical line can be realized as the result of two
consecutive zeros meeting and pushing each other off the critical line as $N$
changes, a process to which we refer to as a collision of zeros. Based on a

order of summation of the elements $B_n(s)$ in $\zeta_{N}(s)$ with $N=\left [

refer to such a re-arrangement as a repelling re-arrangement. In particular,
establishing that the suggested repelling re-arrangement indeed avoids
collisions for any pair of zeros would imply RH.

2003) and relating to an evolving literature in econometrics (including Abadie
et al., 2019; Huntington-Klein, 2020; Borusyak and Hull, 2020), we study how to
improve the efficiency of IV estimates by exploiting the predictable variation
in the strength of the instrument. In the case where both the treatment and
instrument are binary and the instrument is independent of baseline covariates,
we study weighting each observation according to its estimated compliance (that
is, its conditional probability of being affected by the instrument), which we
motivate from a (constrained) solution of the first-stage prediction problem
implicit to IV. The resulting estimator can leverage machine learning to
estimate compliance as a function of baseline covariates. We derive the
large-sample properties of a specific implementation of a weighted IV estimator
in the potential outcomes and local average treatment effect (LATE) frameworks,
and provide tools for inference that remain valid even when the weights are
estimated nonparametrically. With both theoretical results and a simulation
study, we demonstrate that compliance weighting meaningfully reduces the
variance of IV estimates when first-stage heterogeneity is present, and that
this improvement often outweighs any difference between the compliance-weighted

conditioned on their remaining in an oscillatory regime for all time. This
leads us to use the theory of quasi-ergodic measures, and to define
quasi-asymptotic frequencies as conditional, long-time average frequencies. We
show that quasi-asymptotic frequencies always exist, though they may or may not

stochastic oscillators in the literature. In particular, existing results imply
that the asymptotic frequency of a stochastic oscillator depends quadratically

to tracks, and the hypothesis likelihood (of the joint target-measurement
associations) is used to compare among all hypotheses for truncation under a
finite compute budget. It is often assumed however that an individual
target-measurement association likelihood is independent of others, i.e., it
remains the same in whichever hypothesis it belongs to. In the case of Track
Oriented Multiple Hypothesis Tracking (TO-MHT), this leads to a parsimonious
representation of the hypothesis space, with a maximum likelihood solution
obtained through solving an Integer Linear Programming problem. In Labeled
Random Finite Set (Labeled RFS) filters, this leads to an efficient way of
obtaining the top ranked hypotheses through solving a ranked assignment problem
using Murty's algorithm. In this paper we present a Propose and Verify approach
for certain Dependent Likelihood Structures, such that the true hypothesis
likelihood is evaluated jointly for the constituent track-measurement
associations to account for dependence among them, but at the same time that
ranking is still obtained efficiently. This is achieved by proposing a
candidate ranking under an assumption of independence, and then evaluating the
true likelihood one by one, which is guaranteed, for certain Dependent
Likelihood Structures, to not increase from its candidate value, until the
desired number of top ranked hypotheses are obtained. Examples of such
Dependent Likelihood Structures include the Collision Likelihood Structure and
the Occlusion Likelihood Structure, both encountered frequently in

patterns in 3D brains. A particular role in these invasion patterns is likely
played by the distribution of micro-fibres. To investigate explicitly the role

previously-introduced 2D multi-scale moving-boundary framework to take into

Numerical results show that including an anisotropic diffusion term may lead in

the underlying brain structure and its microscopic fibre representation, which

arise in a direct finite element analysis on porous structures. The impact of
porosity on structural elastic performance is approximated using a second order
Taylor expansion where the topological difference between the porous and
reference domains is estimated by topological sensitivity; the field variables
on pore boundaries are approximated as explicit functions of design variables

model called Hierarchical View Predictor (HVP) to learn 3D shape features from
unordered views in an unsupervised manner. To mine highly discriminative
information from unordered views, HVP performs a novel hierarchical view
prediction over a view pair, and aggregates the knowledge learned from the
predictions in all view pairs into a global feature. In a view pair, we pose
hierarchical view prediction as the task of hierarchically predicting a set of
image patches in a current view from its complementary set of patches, and in
addition, completing the current view and its opposite from any one of the two
sets of patches. Hierarchical prediction, in patches to patches, patches to
view and view to view, facilitates HVP to effectively learn the structure of 3D
shapes from the correlation between patches in the same view and the
correlation between a pair of complementary views. In addition, the employed
implicit aggregation over all view pairs enables HVP to learn global features
from unordered views. Our results show that HVP can outperform state-of-the-art

of this work is to address this limitation. Specifically, a novel porosity
sensitivity method is proposed, which integrates the merits of topological
sensitivity and shape sensitivity. While topological sensitivity approximates
the first order change on the quantity of interest when an infinitesimally
small spherical pore is inserted into a dense (no pore) structure, shape
sensitivity estimates the subsequent change in the quantity when the small pore
boundary is continuously perturbed to resemble the geometry reconstructed from
tomography characterization data. In this method, an exterior problem is solved
to explicitly formulate pore stress and strain fields as functions of shape
scaling parameters. By neglecting higher order pore-to-pore interaction terms,
the influence of multiple pores can be estimated through a linear
approximation. The proposed method is first studied on a benchmark example to
establish the impact of different pore parameters on the estimation accuracy.
The method is then applied onto case studies where the pore geometry is either
from tomography reconstruction or computer-generated representations.
Efficiency and accuracy of the method are finally demonstrated using a
commercial 3D application. The proposed method can be extended to other

alleviates the consistency issue of sampling from different view angles. Our
method pushes the neural network to generate a 3D point cloud whose 2D

Our 2D projection matching approach enables the neural network to learn more

'largeness' is certainly necessary in general [. . . ,] the need for
projectivity is not clear."" In this paper, we prove that cancellation holds if
$K$, $L$, and $M$ are finitely generated modules over a commutative Noetherian
ring $S$ such that $K_\mathfrak{p}^{\oplus (1+\text{dim}(S/\mathfrak{p}))}$ is
a direct summand of $M_{\mathfrak{p}}$ over $S_{\mathfrak{p}}$ for every prime
ideal $\mathfrak{p}$ of $S$. We also weaken projectivity conditions in the
cancellation theorems of Bass and Dress and a newer theorem by De
Stefani-Polstra-Yao; in fact, we obtain a statement that unifies all three of
these theorems while obviating a projectivity constraint in each one. To
illustrate the scope of our work, we construct a cancellation example that
simultaneously eludes the three theorems just mentioned as well as many other
observations from the module cancellation literature.

be only eventually consistent. Persistent data is no longer processed with
serialized and transactional access, exposing applications to a range of
potential concurrency anomalies that need to be handled by the application
itself. Controlling concurrent data access in monolithic systems is already
challenging, but the problem is exacerbated in distributed systems. To make it
worse, only little systematic engineering guidance is provided by the software
architecture community regarding this issue. Aims: In this paper, we report on
our study of the effectiveness and applicability of the novel design guidelines
we are proposing in this regard. Method: We used action research and conducted
it in the context of the software architecture design process of a multi-site
platform development project. Results: Our hypotheses regarding effectiveness
and applicability have been accepted in the context of the study. The initial
design guidelines were refined throughout the study. Thus, we also contribute
concrete guidelines for architecting distributed data-intensive systems with
eventually consistent data. The guidelines are an advancement of Domain-Driven
Design and provide additional patterns for the tactical design part.
Conclusions: Based on our results, we recommend using the guidelines to
architect safe eventually consistent systems. Because of the relevance of

oceans. A significant fraction of water, however, remains in the mantle during
magma ocean solidification, and thus the existence of water oceans is not
guaranteed even for exoplanets located in the habitable zone. To discuss the
likelihood of ocean formation, we built two models to predict the rate of
mantle degassing during the magma ocean stage and the subsequent solid-state
convection stage. We find that planets with low H$_2$O/CO$_2$ ratios would not
have a sufficient amount of surface water to develop water oceans immediately
after magma ocean solidification, and the majority of the water inventory would
be retained in the mantle during their subsequent evolution regardless of
planetary size. This is because oceanless planets are likely to operate under
stagnant lid convection, and for such planets, dehydration stiffening of the
depleted lithospheric mantle would limit the rate of mantle degassing. In
contrast, a significant fraction of CO$_2$ would already be degassed during
magma ocean solidification. With a strong greenhouse effect, all surface water
would exist as vapor, and water oceans may be absent throughout planetary
evolution. Volatile concentrations in the bulk silicate Earth are close to the
threshold amount for ocean formation, so if Venus shared similar
concentrations, small differences in solar radiation may explain the divergent
evolutionary paths of Earth and Venus.

(a) it makes the face representations susceptible to privacy leakage (b) it
appears to contribute to bias in face recognition. However, existing bias
mitigation approaches generally require end-to-end training and are unable to
achieve high verification accuracy. Therefore, we present a descriptor-based
adversarial de-biasing approach called `Protected Attribute Suppression System

trained high-performing network to classify identities and simultaneously
reduce encoding of sensitive attributes. This eliminates the need for
end-to-end training. As a component of PASS, we present a novel discriminator
training strategy that discourages a network from encoding protected attribute
information. We show the efficacy of PASS to reduce gender and skintone

applying a pre-filter to the Gr\""unwald-Letnikov type central difference

Vandemonde matrix and exploiting the relationship between the Taylor's series
coefficients and fast Fourier transform. The filter costs O\left(N^{2}\right)
operations to evaluate for O\left(h^{N}\right) of convergence, where h is the
sampling distance. The higher convergence speed should more than offset the
overhead with the requirement of the number of nodal points for a desired error
tolerance significantly reduced. The benefit of progressive generation of the
stencil coefficients for adaptive grid size for dynamic problems with the

application of filtering. The higher convergence rate is verified through

accretion onto black holes in close binaries. We specifically focus on
line-driven winds, which are common in high-mass X-ray binaries. In close
binary systems, the tidal force from the companion star can modify the wind
structure in two different ways. One is the reduction of wind terminal velocity
due to the weaker effective surface gravity. The other is the reduction in mass
flux due to gravity darkening. We incorporate these effects into the so-called
CAK theory in a simple way and investigate the wind flow around the accretor on
the orbital scale. We find that a focused accretion stream is naturally formed
when the Roche lobe filling factor is $\gtrsim0.8$-0.9, analogous to that of
wind Roche lobe overflow, but only when the velocity reduction is taken into
account. The formation of a stream is necessary to bring in sufficient angular
momentum to form an accretion disc around the black hole. Gravity darkening
effects reduce the amount of accreted angular momentum, but not enough to
prevent the formation of a disc. Based on these results, we expect there to be
a discrete step in the observability of high-mass X-ray binaries depending on
whether the donor Roche lobe filling factor is below or above $\sim$0.8-0.9.

Due to the limited resource of autonomous vehicles in platoons, mobile edge
computing (MEC) is usually used to assist vehicles in platoons to obtain useful
information, increasing its safety. Specifically, vehicles usually adopt the
IEEE 802.11 distributed coordination function (DCF) mechanism to transmit large
amount of data to the base station (BS) through vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I)
communications, where the useful information can be extracted by the edge
server connected to the BS and then sent back to the vehicles to make correct
decisions in time. However, vehicles may be moving on different lanes with
different velocities, which incurs the unfair access due to the characteristics
of platoons, i.e., vehicles on different lanes transmit different amount of
data to the BS when they pass through the coverage of the BS, which also
results in the different amount of useful information received by various
vehicles. Moreover, age of information (AoI) is an important performance metric
to measure the freshness of the data. Large average age of data implies not
receiving the useful information in time. It is necessary to design an access
scheme to jointly optimize the fairness and data freshness. In this paper, we
formulate a joint optimization problem in the MEC-assisted V2I networks and
present a multi-objective optimization scheme to solve the problem through
adjusting the minimum contention window under the IEEE 802.11 DCF mode
according to the velocities of vehicles. The effectiveness of the scheme has
been demonstrated by simulation.

nonthermal electrons accelerated by the repeated energy release process, i.e.,
triggering of repetitive magnetic reconnection, while the multiple periods
might be modulated by the sausage oscillation of hot plasma loops. For the

approximation with the lowest estimated Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to the
true posterior. We evaluate Pathfinder on a wide range of posterior
distributions, demonstrating that its approximate draws are better than those
from automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI) and comparable to
those produced by short chains of dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), as
measured by 1-Wasserstein distance. Compared to ADVI and short dynamic HMC
runs, Pathfinder requires one to two orders of magnitude fewer log density and
gradient evaluations, with greater reductions for more challenging posteriors.
Importance resampling over multiple runs of Pathfinder improves the diversity
of approximate draws, reducing 1-Wasserstein distance further and providing a
measure of robustness to optimization failures on plateaus, saddle points, or
in minor modes. The Monte Carlo KL divergence estimates are embarrassingly
parallelizable in the core Pathfinder algorithm, as are multiple runs in the
resampling version, further increasing Pathfinder's speed advantage with
multiple cores.

learn long-range contextual features for semantic segmentation. Rather than
directly construct the graph based on the backbone features, our BGR module
explores a reasonable way to combine segmentation erroneous regions with the
graph construction scenario. Motivated by the fact that most hard-to-segment
pixels broadly distribute on boundary regions, our BGR module uses the boundary
score map as prior knowledge to intensify the graph node connections and
thereby guide the graph reasoning focus on boundary regions. In addition, we
employ an efficient graph convolution implementation to reduce the
computational cost, which benefits the integration of our BGR module into
current segmentation backbones. Extensive experiments on three challenging
segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed BGR
module for semantic segmentation.

hierarchical control scheme, which is integrated by a model predictive control
(MPC) based path planning and trajectory tracking control at the high level,
and a reduced-order extended state observer (RESO) based dynamic control at the
low level. The control at the high level consists of an MPC-based improved path
planner, a velocity planner, and an MPC-based tracking controller. Both the
path planning and trajectory tracking control problems are formulated under an
MPC framework. The control at the low level employs the idea of active
disturbance rejection control (ADRC). The uncertainties are estimated via a
RESO and then compensated in the control in real-time. We show that, for the
first-order uncertain AGV dynamic model, the RESO-based control only needs to
know the control direction. Finally, simulations and experiments on an AGV with
different payloads are conducted. The results illustrate that the proposed

studied this problem for sequences described by global co-evolutionary models,

quadratic potential, who describe selection forces acting on the evolving
entities. Under a Bayesian framework, we developed a reconstruction algorithm
for these sequences and obtained an analytical expression to quantify the

sequences by applying our method to a Potts model. We showed that for both
continuous and discrete configurations, there is a wide range of parameters
where, to properly reconstruct the ancestral sequences, intra-species
correlations must be taken into account. We also demonstrated that, for
sequences with discrete elements, our reconstruction algorithm outperforms
traditional schemes based on independent site approximations.

lack an important aspect of city-wide street networks: streets are denser in

restricts the generating points of the streets to a fixed radius centered at
the origin of the Euclidian plane, thereby capturing the inhomogeneity of the

numerical results, we highlight that the spatial configuration of the streets
is remarkably distinct from the perspective of a city center user to that of a

be suppressed by their limited local receptive fields and insufficient global
reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose a pixel-wise sparse graph
reasoning (PSGR) module and insert it into a segmentation network to enhance
the modeling of long-range dependencies for COVID-19 infected region
segmentation in CT images. In the PSGR module, a graph is first constructed by
projecting each pixel on a node based on the features produced by the
segmentation backbone, and then converted into a sparsely-connected graph by
keeping only K strongest connections to each uncertain pixel. The long-range
information reasoning is performed on the sparsely-connected graph to generate
enhanced features. The advantages of this module are two-fold: (1) the
pixel-wise mapping strategy not only avoids imprecise pixel-to-node projections
but also preserves the inherent information of each pixel for global reasoning;
and (2) the sparsely-connected graph construction results in effective
information retrieval and reduction of the noise propagation. The proposed
solution has been evaluated against four widely-used segmentation models on

Only if a process is both in state 1 and observed to be so does reward accrue.
The aim is to maximize the expected discounted sum of returns over the infinite
horizon subject to a constraint that only $M$ $(<N)$ processes may be observed
at each step. Observation is error-prone: there are known probabilities that
state 1 (0) will be observed as 0 (1). From this one knows, at any time $t$, a
probability that process $i$ is in state 1. The resulting system may be modeled
as a restless multi-armed bandit problem with an information state space of
uncountable cardinality. Restless bandit problems with even finite state spaces
are PSPACE-HARD in general. We propose a novel approach for simplifying the
dynamic programming equations of this class of restless bandits and develop a
low-complexity algorithm that achieves a strong performance and is readily
extensible to the general restless bandit model with observation errors. Under
certain conditions, we establish the existence (indexability) of Whittle index

show by numerical experiments the near-optimal performance of our algorithm in
the general parametric space. Last, we theoretically prove the optimality of

spinal cord diffusion MRI. Purpose: We present a comparative evaluation of
distortion correction methods that use the reversed gradient polarity technique
on spinal cord. We propose novel geometric metrics to measure the alignment of
the reconstructed diffusion model with the apparent centerline of the spinal
cord. Subjects: 95 subjects, among which 29 healthy controls and 66 multiple
sclerosis patients. Assessment: Geometric distortions were corrected using 4
state-of-the-art methods. We measured the alignment of the principal direction
of diffusion with the apparent centerline of the spine after correction and the
correlation with the reference anatomical image. Results are computed per
vertebral level, to evaluate the impact on different portions of the spine.
Besides, subjective evaluation of the quality of the correction of healthy
subjects images was performed by three expert raters. Results: As a result of
distortion correction, the diffusion directions are better aligned locally with
the centerline, in particular at both ends of the acquisition window. The
cross-correlation with anatomical image is also improved by Hyperelastic
Susceptibility Artefact Correction (HySCO) and block-matching. The subjective
evaluation for HySCO is significantly better (p < 0.05) than for
Block-Matching; TOPUP performs significantly worse than the three other

the receptive fields' spectrotemporal plasticity of some neurons in mammals'

localize time-frequency information in ASR systems, using the spatial or
temporal immutability properties of methods such as HMMs, TDNNs, CNNs, and
LSTM-RNNs. However, most of these models have large parameter volumes and are
challenging to train. For this purpose, we have presented a structure called
Time-Frequency Convolutional Maxout Neural Network (TFCMNN) in which parallel
time-domain and frequency-domain 1D-CMNNs are applied simultaneously and
independently to the spectrogram, and then their outputs are concatenated and
applied jointly to a fully connected Maxout network for classification. To
improve the performance of this structure, we have used newly developed methods
and models such as Dropout, maxout, and weight normalization. Two sets of
experiments were designed and implemented on the FARSDAT dataset to evaluate
the performance of this model compared to conventional 1D-CMNN models.
According to the experimental results, the average recognition score of TFCMNN
models is about 1.6% higher than the average of conventional 1D-CMNN models. In
addition, the average training time of the TFCMNN models is about 17 hours
lower than the average training time of traditional models. Therefore, as
proven in other sources, time-frequency localization in ASR systems increases
system accuracy and speeds up the training process.

torque-controlled robots. A good hierarchy is the prerequisite for WBC and can
be predefined according to prior knowledge. However, the real-time computation
would be problematic in the physical applications considering the computational
complexity of WBC. For robots with proprioceptive actuation, the joint friction
in gear reducer would also degrade the torque tracking performance. In our
paper, a reasonable hierarchy of tasks and constraints is first customized for
robot dynamic balancing. Then a real-time WBC is implemented via a
computationally efficient WBC software. Such a method is solved on a modular
master control system UBTMaster characterized by the real-time communication
and powerful computing capability. After the joint friction being well covered
by the model identification, extensive experiments on various balancing
scenarios are conducted on a humanoid Walker3 with proprioceptive actuation.
The robot shows an outstanding balance performance even under external impulses

fundamentally different from higher-dimensional systems. For example,
electron-electron interactions in 1DESs have been predicted to induce
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid behavior. Naturally-occurring grain boundaries in

conducting channels that have been proposed to host Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids,
but charge density wave physics has also been suggested to explain their

has been hampered by an inability to electrostatically gate such boundaries and
thereby tune their charge carrier concentration. Here we present a scanning
tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy study of gate-tunable mirror twin boundaries
(MTBs) in single-layer 1H-MoSe$_2$ devices. Gating here enables STM
spectroscopy to be performed for different MTB electron densities, thus
allowing precise characterization of electron-electron interaction effects.
Visualization of MTB electronic structure under these conditions allows
unambiguous identification of collective density wave excitations having two
distinct velocities, in quantitative agreement with the spin-charge separation
predicted by finite-length Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid theory.

video. Recently, self-supervised methods draw much attention since they are
free of depth annotations and achieve impressive performance on several daytime
benchmarks. However, they produce weird outputs in more challenging nighttime
scenarios because of low visibility and varying illuminations, which bring weak
textures and break brightness-consistency assumption, respectively. To address
these problems, in this paper we propose a novel framework with several
improvements: (1) we introduce Priors-Based Regularization to learn
distribution knowledge from unpaired depth maps and prevent model from being
incorrectly trained; (2) we leverage Mapping-Consistent Image Enhancement
module to enhance image visibility and contrast while maintaining brightness
consistency; and (3) we present Statistics-Based Mask strategy to tune the
number of removed pixels within textureless regions, using dynamic statistics.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of each component.
Meanwhile, our framework achieves remarkable improvements and state-of-the-art
results on two nighttime datasets.

that agent preferences should be specified stochastically rather than

rewards and exponential weighing of trajectories, and allows to reason about
agents using the solid foundation of Bayesian statistics. Stochastic
conditioning, a probabilistic programming paradigm for conditioning models on
distributions rather than values, is the formalism behind agents with

studies have shown that particle energies larger than a few PeV
($10^{15}\,\mathrm{eV}$) could be reached during the early stages of a
core-collapse Supernova, when the high-velocity forward shock expands into the
dense circumstellar medium shaped by the stellar progenitor wind. Such
environments, in particular the type IIn SNe whose progenitors may exhibit
mass-loss rates as high as $10^{-2}M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ \cite{smith14},
could thus lead to $\gamma$-ray emission from $\pi^0$ decay in hadronic
interactions, potentially detectable with current Cherenkov telescopes at
very-high energies. Such a detection would provide direct evidence for
efficient acceleration of CR protons/nuclei in supernovae, and hence new
insights on the long-standing issue of the origin of Galactic Cosmic Rays. In

effects in panel data under a linear factor model with unmeasured confounders.
Compared to other methods tackling factor models such as synthetic controls and
matrix completion, our method does not require the number of time periods to
grow infinitely. Instead, we draw inspiration from the two-way fixed effect
model as a special case of the linear factor model, where a simple
difference-in-differences transformation identifies the effect. We show that
analogous, albeit more complex, transformations exist in the more general
linear factor model, providing a new means to identify the effect in that
model. In fact many such transformations exist, called bridge functions, all
identifying the same causal effect estimand. This poses a unique challenge for
estimation and inference, which we solve by targeting the minimal bridge
function using a regularized estimation approach. We prove that our resulting
average causal effect estimator is root-N consistent and asymptotically normal,
and we provide asymptotically valid confidence intervals. Finally, we provide

extremely metal poor galaxies (EMPGs) selected by a machine-learning technique
applied to the deep (~26 AB mag) optical and wide-area (~500 deg^2) Subaru
imaging data in the EMPRESS survey. Nine out of the 13 candidates are EMPGs
with an oxygen abundance (O/H) less than ~10% solar value (O/H)_sun, and four
sources are contaminants of moderately metal-rich galaxies or no emission-line
objects. Notably, two out of the nine EMPGs have extremely-low stellar masses
and oxygen abundances of 5*10^4--7*10^5 M_sun and 2--3% (O/H)_sun,
respectively. With a sample of five EMPGs with (Fe/O) measurements, two (three)
of which are taken from this study (the literature), we confirm that two EMPGs
with the lowest (O/H) ratios of ~2% (O/H)_sun show high (Fe/O) ratios of ~0.1,
close to the solar abundance ratio. Comparing galaxy chemical enrichment
models, we find that the two EMPGs cannot be explained by a scenario of
metal-poor gas accretion/episodic star-formation history due to their low (N/O)
ratios. We conclude that the two EMPGs can be reproduced by an inclusion of
bright hypernovae and/or hypothetical pair-instability supernovae (SNe)
preferentially produced in a metal-poor environment. This conclusion implies
that primordial galaxies at z~10 could have a high abundance of Fe that is not
originated from Type Ia SNe with delays, and that Fe may not serve as a cosmic
clock for primordial galaxies.

survey is subject to distortions by galaxies' peculiar velocities. Besides the
signatures generated in common N-point statistics, such as the anisotropy in
the galaxy 2-point correlation function, the peculiar velocities also induce
distinct features in LSS's morphological properties, which are fully described
by four Minkowski functionals (MFs), i.e., the volume, surface area, integrated
mean curvature and Euler characteristic (or genus). In this work, by using
large suite of N-body simulations, we present and analyze these important
features in the MFs of LSS on both (quasi-)linear and non-linear scales, with a
focus on the latter. We also find the MFs can give competitive constraints on
cosmological parameters compared to the power spectrum, probablly due to the
non-linear information contained. For galaxy number density similar to the DESI
BGS galaxies, the constraint on $\sigma_8$ from the MFs with one smoothing
scale can be better by $\sim 50\%$ than from the power spectrum. These findings
are important for the cosmological applications of MFs of LSS, and probablly
open up a new avenue for studying the peculiar velocity field itself.

has been greatly advanced by exploiting the outputs of Class Activation Map
(CAM) to generate the pseudo labels for semantic segmentation. However, CAM
merely discovers seeds from a small number of regions, which may be
insufficient to serve as pseudo masks for semantic segmentation. In this paper,
we formulate the expansion of object regions in CAM as an increase in
information. From the perspective of information theory, we propose a novel
Complementary Patch (CP) Representation and prove that the information of the
sum of the CAMs by a pair of input images with complementary hidden (patched)
parts, namely CP Pair, is greater than or equal to the information of the
baseline CAM. Therefore, a CAM with more information related to object seeds
can be obtained by narrowing down the gap between the sum of CAMs generated by
the CP Pair and the original CAM. We propose a CP Network (CPN) implemented by
a triplet network and three regularization functions. To further improve the
quality of the CAMs, we propose a Pixel-Region Correlation Module (PRCM) to
augment the contextual information by using object-region relations between the
feature maps and the CAMs. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets
show that our proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art in WSSS,
validating the effectiveness of our CP Representation and CPN.

BenchENAS to address these issues. BenchENAS aims to achieve fair comparisons
by running different algorithms in the same environment and with the same
settings. To achieve efficient evaluation in a common lab environment,
BenchENAS designs a parallel component and a cache component with high
maintainability. Furthermore, BenchENAS is easy to install and highly
configurable and modular, which brings benefits in good usability and easy
extensibility. The paper conducts efficient comparison experiments on eight
ENAS algorithms with high GPU utilization on this platform. The experiments
validate that the fair comparison issue does exist, and BenchENAS can alleviate

solar-mass stars using the radial velocity technique requires extremely high
precision, on the order of 10$\,$cm$\,$s$^{-1}$, below the intrinsic
variability of even relatively inactive stars, such as the Sun. One such
variable is convective blueshift varying temporally, spatially, and between
spectral lines. We develop a new approach for measuring convective blueshift
and determine the strength of convective blueshift for 810 stars observed by
the HARPS spectrograph, spanning spectral types late-F, G, K, and early-M. We
derive a model for infering blueshift velocity for lines of any depth in
later-type stars of any effective temperature. Using a custom list of spectral
lines, covering a wide range of absorption depths, we create a model for the
line-core shift as a function of line depth, commonly known as the third
signature of granulation. We utilize an extremely-high-resolution solar
spectrum (R$\sim$1$\,$000$\,$000) to empirically account for the nonlinear
nature of the third signature. The solar third signature is then scaled to all
810 stars. Through this we obtain a measure of the convective blueshift
relative to the Sun as a function of stellar effective temperature. We confirm
the general correlation of increasing convective blueshift with effective
temperature and establish a tight, cubic relation between the two that strongly
increases for stars above $\sim$5800$\,$K. For stars between $\sim$4100$\,$K
and $\sim$4700$\,$K we show, for the first time, a plateau in convective shift
and a possible onset of a plateau for stars above 6000$\,$K. Stars below
$\sim$4000$\,$K show neither blueshift nor redshift. We provide a table that
lists expected blueshift velocities for each spectral subtype in the data set
to quickly access the intrinsic noise floor through convective blueshift for
the radial velocity technique.

By constructing appropriate truncated functions to control the super-linear
growth of the original coefficients, we present a type of the truncated EM
method for such SDDEs with variable delay, which is proposed to be approximated
by the value taken at the nearest grid points on the left of the delayed
argument. The strong convergence result (without order) of the method is
established under the local Lipschitz plus generalized Khasminskii-type
conditions and the optimal strong convergence order $1/2$ can be obtained if
the global monotonicity with U function and polynomial growth conditions are
added to the assumptions. Moreover, the partially truncated EM method is proved
to preserve the mean-square and H_\infty stabilities of the true solutions.
Compared with the known results on the truncated EM method for SDDEs, a better
order of strong convergence is obtained under more relaxing conditions on the
coefficients, and more refined technical estimates are developed so as to
overcome the challenges arising due to variable delay. Lastly, some numerical
examples are utilized to confirm the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

show that our multi-task learning model can achieve high results compared with
single-task learning while reducing the time and space constraints required to

the preference of multi-task learning over single-task learning resulting in a
higher weighted F1-score on all three languages. We apply two multi-task

the remedy of offloading the load to the cloud incurs long delay. In this
paper, we address this challenge by proposing an adaptive anomaly detection

multiple anomaly detection DNN models with increasing complexity, and associate
each of them to a corresponding HEC layer. Then, we design an adaptive model

Recently, data-driven methods have achieved remarkable success. However, these
approaches neglect that the appearance of rain is often accompanied by low
light conditions, which will further degrade the image quality. Therefore, it
is very indispensable to jointly remove the rain and enhance the light for
real-world rain image restoration. In this paper, we aim to address this
problem from two aspects. First, we proposed a novel entangled network, namely
EMNet, which can remove the rain and enhance illumination in one go.
Specifically, two encoder-decoder networks interact complementary information
through entanglement structure, and parallel rain removal and illumination
enhancement. Considering that the encoder-decoder structure is unreliable in
preserving spatial details, we employ a detail recovery network to restore the
desired fine texture. Second, we present a new synthetic dataset, namely
DarkRain, to boost the development of rain image restoration algorithms in
practical scenarios. DarkRain not only contains different degrees of rain, but
also considers different lighting conditions, and more realistically simulates
the rainfall in the real world. EMNet is extensively evaluated on the proposed
benchmark and achieves state-of-the-art results. In addition, after a simple
transformation, our method outshines existing methods in both rain removal and
low-light image enhancement. The source code and dataset will be made publicly

which is confined by MoS 2 bilayers. The polymer thermal conductivity can be
considerably enhanced when polymer chains are confined by MoS 2 sheets, in
particular such behavior is more obvious for charged surfaces. The presence of
the MoS 2 surfaces leads to well- ordering of polymer chains as well as denser
packing which is an increase in {\lambda} in the polymer network via the use of
MoS 2 surface confinement. Polymer chains elongation as well as their
preferential alignment parallel to the MoS 2 surfaces indicates that {\lambda}
in the polymer domain of the considered nanocomposites is larger than the one
in the pure polymer phase. Additionally, our results of number of hydrogen
bonds (HBs) in confined polymer chains suggest that a combined effect of the
mentioned structural modification and enlarged values of HBs may cooperatively
contribute to high polymer thermal conductivity facilitating phonon transport.

recently introduced continuous SSIM (cSSIM), which allows one to analyze
sequences of images of increasingly fine resolutions, and further extend the
definition of the index to encompass the locally weighted version that is used
in practice. For both the local and the global versions, we prove that the
continuous index includes the classical SSIM as a special case, and we provide
a precise connection between image similarity measured by the cSSIM and by the
$L_2$ norm. Using this connection, we derive bounds on the cSSIM by means of
bounds on the $L_2$ error, and we even prove that the two error measures are
equivalent in certain circumstances. We exploit these results to obtain precise
rates of convergence with respect to the cSSIM for several concrete image
interpolation methods, and we further validate these findings by different

obtain novel insights into the features and limitations of the SSIM, including

crucial biological functions, such as cell fate and division orientation. But
cell-to-cell shape variability is often regarded as noise. In contrast, recent
works reveal that shape variability in diverse epithelial monolayers follows a
nearly universal distribution. However, the origin and implications of this
universality are unclear. Here, assuming contractility and adhesion are crucial
for cell shape, characterized via aspect ratio (AR), we develop a mean-field
analytical theory for shape variability. We find that a single parameter,
$\alpha$, containing all the system-specific details, describes the probability
distribution function (PDF) of AR; this leads to a universal relation between
the standard deviation and the average of AR. The PDF for the scaled AR is not
strictly but almost universal. The functional form is not related to jamming,
contrary to common beliefs, but a consequence of a mathematical property. In
addition, we obtain the scaled area distribution, described by the parameter
$\mu$. We show that $\alpha$ and $\mu$ together can distinguish the effects of
changing physical conditions, such as maturation, on different system
properties. The theory is verified in simulations of two distinct models of
epithelial monolayers and agrees well with existing experiments. We demonstrate
that in a confluent monolayer, average shape determines both the shape
variability and dynamics. Our results imply the cell shape variability is
inevitable, where a single parameter describes both statics and dynamics and
provides a framework to analyze and compare diverse epithelial systems.

astronomers studying the generation and removal of small dust particles on
asteroids. Aims. In this work, we aim to investigate the importance of thermal
radiation pressure from asteroid regolith (AR) acting on small dust particles
over the surface of the AR. In particular, we aim to understand the role of
thermal radiation in the near-Sun environment. Methods. We describe the
acceleration of particles over the AR within the radiation fields (direct
solar, reflected (scattered) solar, and thermal radiation) in addition to the
asteroid's rotation and gravitational field. Mie theory is used because the
particles of interest have sizes comparable to thermal wavelengths (~1-100
{\mu}m), and thus the geometric approximation is not applicable. A new set of
formalisms is developed for the purpose. Results. We find that the acceleration
of particles with spherical radius < 1 {\mu}m to ~10 {\mu}m is dominated by the
thermal radiation from the AR when the asteroid is in the near-Sun environment
(heliocentric distance rh < 0.8 au). Under thermal radiation dominance, the net
acceleration is towards space, that is, outwards from the AR. This outward
acceleration is the strongest for particles of ~1 {\mu}m in radius, regardless
of other parameters. A preliminary trajectory integration using the
Phaethon-like model shows that such particles escape from the gravitational
field within about 10 minutes. Our results are consistent with the previous
observational studies on Phaethon in that the ejected dust particles have a
spherical radius of ~1 {\mu}m.

prediction is crucial to traffic management in metro systems. Due to the
delayed effect in latest complete OD flow collection, complex spatiotemporal
correlations of OD flows in high dimension, it is more challengeable than other
traffic prediction tasks of time series. Existing methods need to be improved
due to not fully utilizing the real-time passenger mobility data and not
sufficiently modeling the implicit correlation of the mobility patterns between
stations. In this paper, we propose a Completion based Adaptive Heterogeneous
Graph Convolution Spatiotemporal Predictor. The novelty is mainly reflected in
two aspects. The first is to model real-time mobility evolution by establishing
the implicit correlation between observed OD flows and the prediction target OD
flows in high dimension based on a key data-driven insight: the destination
distributions of the passengers departing from a station are correlated with
other stations sharing similar attributes (e.g. geographical location, region
function). The second is to complete the latest incomplete OD flows by
estimating the destination distribution of unfinished trips through considering
the real-time mobility evolution and the time cost between stations, which is
the base of time series prediction and can improve the model's dynamic
adaptability. Extensive experiments on two real world metro datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our model over other competitors with the
biggest model performance improvement being nearly 4\%. In addition, the data
complete framework we propose can be integrated into other models to improve
their performance up to 2.1\%.

efficiently. Particularly, unsupervised deep hashing is supported by powerful
deep neural networks and has the desirable advantage of label independence. It
is a promising technique for scalable image retrieval. However, deep models
introduce a large number of parameters, which is hard to optimize due to the
lack of explicit semantic labels and brings considerable training cost. As a
result, the retrieval accuracy and training efficiency of existing unsupervised
deep hashing are still limited. To tackle the problems, in this paper, we
propose a simple and efficient \emph{Lightweight Augmented Graph Network
Hashing} (LAGNH) method with a two-pronged strategy. For one thing, we extract
the inner structure of the image as the auxiliary semantics to enhance the
semantic supervision of the unsupervised hash learning process. For another, we
design a lightweight network structure with the assistance of the auxiliary
semantics, which greatly reduces the number of network parameters that needs to
be optimized and thus greatly accelerates the training process. Specifically,
we design a cross-modal attention module based on the auxiliary semantic
information to adaptively mitigate the adverse effects in the deep image
features. Besides, the hash codes are learned by multi-layer message passing
within an adversarial regularized graph convolutional network. Simultaneously,
the semantic representation capability of hash codes is further enhanced by
reconstructing the similarity graph.

using a two-band model of nickelates capturing dominant contributions from

first-principles Wannier functions to properly account for the tunneling
processes and obtain V, U, and mixed spectral line-shapes depending on the
position of the STM tip within the unit cell. The V- and U-shaped spectra are
contributed from Ni and R-bands, respectively, and Wannier functions, in
essence, provide position-dependent weighing factors, determining the spectral
line-shape at a given intra-unit cell position. We propose a phase-sensitive

effectively but with high resolution MR images. In the framework of the FA-GAN,
the local fusion feature block, consisting of different three-pass networks by
using different convolution kernels, is proposed to extract image features at
different scales. And the global feature fusion module, including the channel
attention module, the self-attention module, and the fusion operation, is
designed to enhance the important features of the MR image. Moreover, the
spectral normalization process is introduced to make the discriminator network
stable. 40 sets of 3D magnetic resonance images (each set of images contains
256 slices) are used to train the network, and 10 sets of images are used to
test the proposed method. The experimental results show that the PSNR and SSIM

fitting between a planar mirror and an external ring could be used to induce
the required curvature to realize new adaptive lens for optical aberration

focused on measuring and modelling the correlations of luminous red galaxies
with galaxy positions or the filaments of the cosmic web. In this work, we
investigate alignments around cosmic voids. We measure the intrinsic alignments
of luminous red galaxies detected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey around a
sample of voids constructed from those same tracers and with radii in the
ranges: $[20-30; 30-40; 40-50]$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc and in the redshift range
$z=0.4-0.8$. We present fits to the measurements based on a linear model at
large scales, and on a new model based on the void density profile inside the
void and in its neighbourhood. We constrain the free scaling amplitude of our
model at small scales, finding no significant alignment at $1\sigma$ for either
sample. We observe a deviation from the null hypothesis, at large scales, of
2$\sigma$ for voids with radii between 20 and 30 $h^{-1}$ Mpc, and 1.5 $\sigma$
for voids with radii between 30 and 40 $h^{-1}$ Mpc and constrain the amplitude

demonstrate how to achieve quantum control of both the electric and magnetic
components of an incident single-photon pulse by engineering the collective
response of a two-dimensional atomic array. High-fidelity absorption and
storage in a long-lived subradiant state, and its subsequent retrieval, are
achieved by controlling classically or quantum mechanically the ac Stark shifts
of the atomic levels and suppressing the scattering during the absorption.
Quantum wavefront control of the transmitted photon with nearly zero reflection
is prepared by coupling the collective state of the array to another photon in
a cavity and by engineering a Huygens' surface of atoms using only a single
coherent standing wave. The proposed schemes allow for the generation of
entanglement between the cavity, the lattice, and hence the state of the
stored, reflected or transmitted light, and for quantum-state transfer between
the cavity and propagating photons. Bipartite entanglement generation is
explicitly calculated between a stored single-photon excitation of the array

phase superposition, polarization, and direction of a transmitted or reflected
photon, providing quantum-optical switches and functional quantum interfaces
between light and atoms that could form links in a larger quantum information

the said fluid by determining the shape of an obstacle inside the channel.
Meanwhile, the shape variation is limited by a perimeter functional and a
volume constraint. The perimeter functional was considered to act as a Tikhonov
regularizer and the volume constraint is added to exempt us from topological
changes in the domain. The shape derivative of the objective functional was
formulated using the rearrangement method, and this derivative was later on
used for gradient descent methods. Additionally, an augmented Lagrangian method

interference. They used a neural network that tried to learn addition using two
groups of examples as two different tasks. In their case, learning the second
task rapidly deteriorated the acquired knowledge about the previous one. We
hypothesize that this could be a symptom of a fundamental problem: addition is
an algorithmic task that should not be learned through pattern recognition.
Therefore, other model architectures better suited for this task would avoid
catastrophic forgetting. We use a neural network with a different architecture
that can be trained to recover the correct algorithm for the addition of binary
numbers. This neural network includes conditional clauses that are naturally
treated within the back-propagation algorithm. We test it in the setting
proposed by McCloskey and Cohen and training on random additions one by one.
The neural network not only does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting but it
improves its predictive power on unseen pairs of numbers as training
progresses. We also show that this is a robust effect, also present when
averaging many simulations. This work emphasizes the importance that neural
network architecture has for the emergence of catastrophic forgetting and
introduces a neural network that is able to learn an algorithm.

hyperparameters together, the learning rate and the momentum coefficient, that
play the significant role for the linear rate of convergence in non-convex
optimization. Our analysis is based on the use of a hyperparameters-dependent
stochastic differential equation (hp-dependent SDE) that serves as a continuous
surrogate for SGD with momentum. Similarly, we establish the linear convergence
for the continuous-time formulation of SGD with momentum and obtain an explicit
expression for the optimal linear rate by analyzing the spectrum of the
Kramers-Fokker-Planck operator. By comparison, we demonstrate how the optimal
linear rate of convergence and the final gap for SGD only about the learning
rate varies with the momentum coefficient increasing from zero to one when the
momentum is introduced. Then, we propose a mathematical interpretation why the
SGD with momentum converges faster and more robust about the learning rate than
the standard SGD in practice. Finally, we show the Nesterov momentum under the
existence of noise has no essential difference with the standard momentum.

inspired by a real-world service industry problem. In this problem, there is a
mixture of known demand and uncertain future demand. Prior to having full
knowledge of the demand, we must decide upon how many jobs we plan to complete
on each day in the planning horizon. Any jobs that are not completed by the end
of their due date incur a cost and become due the following day. We present two
distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) models for this problem. The first
is a non-parametric model with a phi-divergence based ambiguity set. The second
is a parametric model, where we treat the number of uncertain jobs due on each
day as a binomial random variable with an unknown success probability. We
reformulate the parametric model as a mixed integer program and find that it
scales poorly with the sizes of the ambiguity and uncertainty sets. Hence, we
make use of theoretical properties of the binomial distribution to derive fast
heuristics based on dimension reduction. One is based on cutting surface
algorithms commonly seen in the DRO literature. The other operates on a small
subset of the uncertainty set for the future demand. We perform extensive
computational experiments to establish the performance of our algorithms. We

$M_j$ each of which is biholomorphic to a fixed domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb

Building on work of Fornaess--Sibony, we study two cases namely, $M$ is
Kobayashi hyperbolic and the other being the corank one case in which the
Kobayashi metric degenerates along one direction. When $M$ is Kobayashi
hyperbolic, its complete description is obtained when $\Omega$ is one of the
following domains -- (i) a smoothly bounded Levi corank one domain, (ii) a
smoothly bounded convex domain, (iii) a strongly pseudoconvex polyhedral domain
in $\mathbb C^2$, or (iv) a simply connected domain in $\mathbb C^2$ with
generic piecewise smooth Levi-flat boundary. With additional hypotheses, the
case when $\Omega$ is the minimal ball or the symmetrized polydisc in $\mathbb
C^n$ can also be handled. When the Kobayashi metric on $M$ has corank one and
$\Omega$ is either of (i), (ii) or (iii) listed above, it is shown that $M$ is
biholomorphic to a locally trivial fibre bundle with fibre $\mathbb C$ over a
holomorphic retract of $\Omega$ or that of a limiting domain associated with
it. Finally, when $\Omega = \Delta \times \mathbb B^{n-1}$, the product of the
unit disc $\Delta \subset \mathbb C$ and the unit ball $\mathbb B^{n-1} \subset
\mathbb C^{n-1}$, a complete description of holomorphic retracts is obtained.
As a consequence, if $M$ is Kobayashi hyperbolic and $\Omega = \Delta \times
\mathbb B^{n-1}$, it is shown that $M$ is biholomorphic to $\Omega$. Further,
if the Kobayashi metric on $M$ has corank one, then $M$ is globally a product;
in fact, it is biholomorphic to $Z \times \mathbb C$, where $Z \subset \Omega =
\Delta \times \mathbb B^{n-1}$ is a holomorphic retract.

Results from the theory of exact penalty functions can be used to guarantee

Therefore, there is a need to estimate the aggregate flexibility at the
secondary substation available from the LV grids. The flexibility estimation
can only be achieved through monitoring of LV grid and the distributed energy
resources (DERs) connected at the LV level. Moreover, the variability of
intermittent resources affects the flexibility estimation methodology, and the
DSO operation must be robust to the changes in generation or demand outputs.
Furthermore, the up-to-date and accurate model of the LV grid is difficult to

these datasets, which are typically on the scale of 30 arcseconds (~900m). This
need for improved spatial resolution in climate datasets has motivated several
groups to statistically downscale various combinations of observational or

used makes it difficult to reconcile the resultant differences between these
high-resolution datasets. Here we make use of the KrigR R-package to
statistically downscale the world-leading ERA5(-Land) reanalysis data using
kriging. We show that kriging can accurately recover spatial heterogeneity of

the uncertainty associated with the statistical downscaling, one can
investigate and account for confidence in high-resolution climate data; and
that the statistical uncertainty provided by KrigR can explain much of the

memory effect is exploited for building a three-dimensional model accurately
describing the generation, propagation and detection of time-resolved broadband

diameter distances at $z\lesssim 10$. In this work, we extend PAge to a More
Accurate Parameterization based on cosmic Age (MAPAge) by adding a new degree

physically motivated models and their phenomenological PAge approximations. The
accuracy of MAPAge, typically of order $10^{-3}$ in angular diameter distances
at $z\lesssim 10$, is significantly better than PAge. We compare PAge and
MAPAge with current observational data and forecast data. The conjecture
in~\citet{Huang:2020mub}, that PAge approximation is sufficiently good for

that the extension from PAge to MAPAge is important for future observations,

seismic full waveform inversion (FWI) frequently arise in the geoscience and
related fields. For such problems, many observations are usually gathered by
multiple sources, which form the right-hand-sides of the PDE constraint.
Solving the inverse problem with such massive data sets is computationally
demanding, in particular when dealing with large number of model parameters.
This paper proposes a novel randomized source sketching method for the
efficient resolution of multisource PDE constrained optimization problems. We
first formulate the different source-encoding strategies used in seismic
imaging into a unified framework based on a randomized sketching. To this end,
the source dimension of the problem is projected in a smaller domain by a
suitably defined projection matrix that gathers the physical sources in
super-sources through a weighted summation. This reduction in the number of
physical sources decreases significantly the number of PDE solves while
suitable sparsity-promoting regularization can efficiently mitigate the
footprint of the cross-talk noise to maintain the convergence speed of the
algorithm. We implement the randomized sketching method in an extended
search-space formulation of frequency-domain FWI, which relies on the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Numerical examples carried
out with a series of well documented 2D benchmarks demonstrate that the
randomized sketching algorithm reduces the cost of large-scale problems by at
least one order of magnitude compared to the original deterministic algorithm.

which is the projection of the black hole's unstable-photon region on the
observer's sky. We highlight two key mechanisms responsible for producing the
sharp-edged dip: i) the reduction of intensity observed in rays that intersect
the unstable-photon region, and thus the perfectly absorbing event horizon,
versus rays that do not (blocking), and ii) the increase of intensity observed
in rays that travel along extended, horizon-circling paths near the boundary of
the unstable-photon region (path-lengthening). We demonstrate that the
black-hole shadow is a distinct phenomenon from the photon ring, and that
models exist in which the former may be observed, but not the latter.
Additionally, we show that the black-hole shadow and its associated visual
signature differ from the more model-dependent brightness depressions
associated with thin-disk models, because for geometrically thick and optically
thin emission regions, the blocking and path-lengthening effects are quite
general. Consequentially, the black-hole shadow is a robust and fairly

intention destination prediction is an essential task in online travel
platforms. The reason is that, the user may be interested in the travel plan
only when the plan matches his real intention destination. Therefore, in this
paper, we focus on predicting users' intention destinations in online travel
platforms. In detail, we act as online travel platforms (such as Fliggy and
Airbnb) to recommend travel plans for users, and the plan consists of various
vacation items including hotel package, scenic packages and so on. Predicting
the actual intention destination in travel planning is challenging. Firstly,
users' intention destination is highly related to their travel status (e.g.,
planning for a trip or finishing a trip). Secondly, users' actions (e.g.
clicking, searching) over different product types (e.g. train tickets, visa
application) have different indications in destination prediction. Thirdly,
users may mostly visit the travel platforms just before public holidays, and
thus user behaviors in online travel platforms are more sparse, low-frequency
and long-period. Therefore, we propose a Deep Multi-Sequences fused neural

sequences. Real datasets are used to evaluate the performance of our proposed
DMSN models. Experimental results indicate that the proposed DMSN models can

show how condensation of primordial gravitational waves, which are generared at
the very early eras immediately after the big bang, can lead to inflation of
the so called running vacuum model (RVM) type, without external inflatons. The
role of the slow-roll field is played by the KR axion, but it does not drive
inflation. The non-linearities in the anomaly terms do. Chiral fermionic matter
excitations appear at the end of this RVM inflation, as a result of the decay
of the RVM vacuum, and are held responsible for the cancellation of the
primordial gravitational anomalies. Chiral anomalies, however, survive in the
post-inflationary epochs, and can lead to the generation of a non perturbative
mass for the KR axion, which could thus play the role of dark matter in this
Universe. As a result of the condensed gravitational anomaly, there is a
Lorentz-invariance violating KR axion background, which remains undiluted
during the RVM inflation, and can lead to baryogenesis through leptogenesis in
the radiation era, in models with sterile right-handed neutrinos. I also
discuss the phenomenology of the model in the modern era, paying particular
attention to linking it with a version of RVM, called type II RVM, which
arguably can alleviate observed tensions in the current-epoch cosmological

in network traffic measurement. The statistical results are used to evaluate
the potential impact of user behaviors on network traffic. This requires
algorithms that are capable of storing and retrieving a high volume of IP
addresses within time and memory constraints. In this paper, we present two
efficient algorithms for collecting the statistics of large-scale IP addresses
that balance time efficiency and memory consumption. The proposed solutions
take into account the sparse nature of the statistics of IP addresses while
building the hash function and maintain a dynamic balance among layered memory
blocks. There are two layers in the first proposed method, each of which
contains a limited number of memory blocks. Each memory block contains 256
elements of size $256 \times 8$ bytes for a 64-bit system. In contrast to
built-in hash mapping functions, the proposed solution completely avoids
expensive hash collisions while retaining the linear time complexity of
hash-based solutions. Moreover, the mechanism dynamically determines the hash
index length according to the range of IP addresses, and can balance the time
and memory constraints. In addition, we propose an efficient parallel scheme to
speed up the collection of statistics. The experimental results on several

  Block",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Human Motion Prediction is a crucial task in computer vision and robotics. It
has versatile application potentials such as in the area of human-robot
interactions, human action tracking for airport security systems, autonomous
car navigation, computer gaming to name a few. However, predicting human motion
based on past actions is an extremely challenging task due to the difficulties
in detecting spatial and temporal features correctly. To detect temporal
features in human poses, we propose an Inception Residual Block(IRB), due to
its inherent capability of processing multiple kernels to capture salient
features. Here, we propose to use multiple 1-D Convolution Neural Network (CNN)
with different kernel sizes and input sequence lengths and concatenate them to
get proper embedding. As kernels strides over different receptive fields, they
detect smaller and bigger salient features at multiple temporal scales. Our
main contribution is to propose a residual connection between input and the
output of the inception block to have a continuity between the previously
observed pose and the next predicted pose. With this proposed architecture, it
learns prior knowledge much better about human poses and we achieve much higher
prediction accuracy as detailed in the paper. Subsequently, we further propose
to feed the output of the inception residual block as an input to the Graph
Convolution Neural Network (GCN) due to its better spatial feature learning
capability. We perform a parametric analysis for better designing of our model
and subsequently, we evaluate our approach on the Human 3.6M dataset and
compare our short-term as well as long-term predictions with the state of the
art papers, where our model outperforms most of the pose results, the detailed
reasons of which have been elaborated in the paper.

measurement of large-scale executions may record mountains of performance data.
Second, performance measurements for parallel programs are sparse in two ways:
the set of metrics present for any context and the set of contexts present in
different threads. For GPU-accelerated applications, an important source of
sparsity is that none of the myriad of GPU metrics apply to any of the many CPU
contexts. To address these challenges, we developed a novel streaming
aggregation approach to postmortem analysis that employs both shared and
distributed memory parallelism to aggregate sparse performance measurements
from every rank, thread, and GPU stream of an application, and attributes
heterogeneous call path profiles and traces to source code. Using the same

studying observations of stellar light curves from recent space missions. Aims.
We aim to study how the mid-range periodicity observed in solar activity
indices influences the total solar irradiance. Methods. We studied periodic
variations of total solar irradiance based on SATIRE-S and SOHO/VIRGO data
during solar cycles 23-24 on timescales of Rieger-type periodicity. Then we
compared the power spectrum of oscillations in the total solar irradiance to
those of sunspot and faculae data to determine their contributions. Results.
Wavelet analyses of TSI data reveal strong peaks at 180 days and 115 days in
cycle 23, while cycle 24 showed periods of 170 days and 145 days. There are
several periods in the sunspot and faculae data that are not seen in total
solar irradiance as they probably cancel each other out through simultaneous
brightening (in faculae) and darkening (in sunspots). Rieger-type periodicity
is probably caused by magneto-Rossby waves in the internal dynamo layer, where
the solar cyclic magnetic field is generated. Therefore, the observed periods
in the total solar irradiance and the wave dispersion relation allow us to
estimate the dynamo magnetic field strength as 10-15 kG. Conclusions. Total
solar irradiance can be used to estimate the magnetic field strength in the
dynamo layer. This tool can be of importance in estimating the dynamo magnetic
field strength of solar-like stars using light curves obtained by space

host tissue or invasive species colonizing a new continent. Evolution typically
selects for higher expansion rates during spatial growth, but it has been
suggested that slower expanders can take over under certain conditions. Here,
we report an experimental observation of such population dynamics. We
demonstrate that the slower mutants win not only when the two types are
intermixed at the front but also when they are spatially segregated into
sectors. The latter was thought to be impossible because previous studies
focused exclusively on the global competitions mediated by expansion velocities
but overlooked the local competitions at sector boundaries. We developed a
theory of sector geometry that accounts for both local and global competitions
and describes all possible sector shapes. In particular, the theory predicted
that a slower, but more competitive, mutant forms a dented V-shaped sector as
it takes over the expansion front. Such sectors were indeed observed
experimentally and their shapes matched up quantitatively with the theory. In
simulations, we further explored several mechanism that could provide slow
expanders with a local competitive advantage and showed that they are all
well-described by our theory. Taken together, our results shed light on
previously unexplored outcomes of spatial competition and establish a universal
framework to understand evolutionary and ecological dynamics in expanding

precession rate as indicators for the dynamical state of the disks. We simulate
disks in close binaries by performing two-dimensional radiative hydrodynamical

Although their method is epochal in the sense that it can handle the skewness

optimization, it cannot identify all elements in the skewness matrix due to

efforts have also been made to reconcile ASP with classical first-order logic

FO, which allows ASP-like problem solving in a purely classical setting. This
language may be more accessible to domain experts already familiar with FO, and
may be easier to combine with other formalisms that are based on classical
logic. It is supported by the IDP inference system, which has successfully
competed in a number of ASP competitions. Here, however, technological progress
has been hampered by the limited number of systems that are available for

impact on robot grasping. The rise of deep learning has greatly transformed the
pipeline of robotic grasping from model-based approach to data-driven stream,
which generally requires a large scale of grasping data either collected in
simulation or from real-world examples. In this paper, we proposed a
sim-to-real framework to transfer the object segmentation model learned in
simulation to the real-world. First, data samples are collected in simulation,
including RGB, 6D pose, and point cloud. Second, we also present a GAN-based
unknown object segmentation method through domain adaptation, which consists of
an image translation module and an image segmentation module. The image
translation module is used to shorten the reality gap and the segmentation
module is responsible for the segmentation mask generation. We used the above
method to perform segmentation experiments on unknown objects in a bin-picking
scenario. Finally, the experimental result shows that the segmentation model
learned in simulation can be used for real-world data segmentation.

Existing approaches often rely on massive query logs and interaction data to

first needs a massive user base to build a sufficient log; public query logs

method is generally employed to complete the conversion from the

too large, the addition of the embedding layer significantly slows down the
convergence speed of the entire neural network, which is not acceptable in
real-world scenarios. In addition, as the interaction between users and items
increases and the relationship between items becomes more complicated, the
embedding method proposed for sequence data is no longer suitable for graphic

Dual-modal Graph Embedding Method (DGEM) to solve these problems. DGEM includes
two modes, static and dynamic. We first construct the item graph to extract the

high-order proximity between the items. Then we generate the graph embedding

increase retrieval performance compared to bi-encoders with one encoder for the

theoretical cosmologists, since it may contain imprints of the quantum epoch.
In view of the fact that higher order curvature terms might be present in the
effective inflationary Lagrangian, in this work we introduce the theoretical
framework of power-law $f(R)$ gravity corrected canonical scalar field
inflation, aiming to study the inflationary dynamics of this new framework. The
main characteristic of this new theoretical framework is the dominance of a
power-law $f(R)$ gravity term $\sim R^n$, with $1<n<2$, compared to the
Einstein-Hilbert term $\sim R$. In effect, the field equations are controlled
by the $R^n$ term in contrast to the Einstein-Hilbert canonical scalar theory.
We extract the slow-roll field equations and we calculate the slow-roll indices
of the resulting theory which acquire quite elegant final form, when the
slow-roll conditions hold true. Accordingly, we examine quantitatively the
inflationary phenomenological implications of the theoretical framework we
introduced, by choosing simple hybrid-like scalar field potentials. As we
evince the resulting theory is in good agreement with the latest Planck data
for a wide range of the free parameters of the model. Thus our theoretical
framework makes possible to obtain viable inflationary theories, which
otherwise would be non-viable, such as the simple power-law $f(R)$ gravity
model or the simple power-law scalar model.

predicting the downstream Bz component. To do so, we develop a predictive tool
based on machine learning that is trained and tested on 348 ICMEs from Wind,
STEREO-A, and STEREO-B measurements. We train the machine learning models to
predict the minimum value of the Bz component and the maximum value of the
total magnetic field Bz in the magnetic obstacle. To validate the tool, we let
the ICMEs sweep over the spacecraft and assess how continually feeding in situ
measurements into the tool improves the Bz prediction. Because the application
of the tool in operations needs an automated detection of ICMEs, we implement
an existing automated ICME detection algorithm and test its robustness for the
time intervals under scrutiny. We find that the predictive tool can predict the
minimum value of the Bz component in the magnetic obstacle with a mean absolute
error of 3.12 nT and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.71 when the sheath
region and the first 4 hours of the magnetic obstacle are observed. While the
underlying hypothesis is unlikely to solve the Bz problem, the tool shows
promise for ICMEs that have a recognizable magnetic flux rope signature.
Transitioning the tool to operations could lead to improved space weather
forecasting.

such an optimal operational methodology for the MV and LV grids; and b) an
aggregated flexibility estimation methodology estimated separately for fast and

based on model-based MV grids and a sensitivity coefficients-based model-less

setpoints to DERs. The approaches have been validated on a real MV and LV

consistently couples chemical reactions, physical transport, and elastic
deformation. The SEI model comprises elastic and plastic deformation, fracture,
and growth. Capacity fade measurements on graphite anodesand in-situ mechanical

Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) scenarios, expect to support an extended
number of nodes with higher throughput, which cannot be sufficiently supported
by the current WSN protocols. Two prior protocols, Wi-SUN Field Area Network
(Wi-SUN FAN) and IETF 6TiSCH standards, are popularly used that are
respectively based on asynchronous Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision
Avoidance (CSMA/CA) and IEEE 802.15.4 Time Scheduled Channel Hopping (TSCH).
However, the former one with CSMA/CA can be prone to the Hidden Node Problem
(HNP) that leads to a degradation of reliability, while the latter one with
TSCH avoids HNP by using synchronously scheduling but requires massive control
signalling that degrades the upper-bound of throughput. Accordingly, this paper
tackles the challenge of how to improve the upper-bound of throughput without
loss of reliability. To do so, we first present an in-depth evaluation of
reliability and throughput between the two existing standards via system-level
simulation. We then propose a self-configurable grouping (SCG) method to
cluster nodes without using location information of each node. This SCG method
eliminates around 99\% HNP in CSMA/CA, thus greatly improves its reliability
with maintaining the relatively high upper-bound of throughput. Our results
show that the SCG method almost doubles the network throughput compared with
both 6TiSCH and Wi-SUN FAN in heavy traffic scenarios, while providing
extremely high reliability of more than 99.999\%.

recent work proposes non-Bayesian methods to address the complexities of MMP
data, the issue of sparse response, where no or very few ""yes"" responses are
recorded for one or more sets, is unaddressed. The presence of sparse response
sets results in underestimates of variance, loss of coverage, and lowered power
in existing methods. Bayesian methods have not previously been considered for
MMP data but provide a useful framework when sparse responses are present. In
particular, the Bayesian probit model provides an elegant solution to the

half-Cauchy priors on the mean model variances, and a multivariate analysis
with a Bayesian functional principal component analysis (FPCA) to model the
latent covariance. We show that the multivariate analysis performs well on MMP

GeV. Popular interpretations of this excess are due to either spherically

assumed that the excess could be imitated by the emission of molecular clouds

our work is in detailed elaboration of the depletion mechanism of CRs with the

self-excited MHD turbulence. Such depletion of CRs inside the clouds may be a
reason of deficit of gamma rays from the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) at

components at those energies, and may potentially absorb the GeV excess by
simple renormalization of key components.

CNN model is trained on a manually pre-labelled dataset on historical wetlands

  3) The presented CNN performs well and achieves a $F_1$-score of 0.886 when

are additionally used to generate a GIS layer of the presumable historical
geographical distribution of wetlands for the area that is depicted in the
southern collection in Generalstabskartan, which covers the southern half of
Sweden. This GIS layer is released as an open resource and can be freely used.

originally proposed in order to address the overestimation issue in the
original DQN algorithm. The double DQN has successfully shown both
theoretically and empirically the importance of decoupling in terms of action
evaluation and selection in computation of targets values; although, all the
benefits were acquired with only a simple adaption to DQN algorithm, minimal
possible change as it was mentioned by the authors. Nevertheless, there seems a
roll-back in the proposed algorithm of Double-DQN since the parameters of
policy network are emerged again in the target value function which were
initially withdrawn by DQN with the hope of tackling the serious issue of
moving targets and the instability caused by it (i.e., by moving targets) in
the process of learning. Therefore, in this paper three modifications to the
Double-DQN algorithm are proposed with the hope of maintaining the performance
in the terms of both stability and overestimation. These modifications are
focused on the logic of decoupling the best action selection and evaluation in
the target value function and the logic of tackling the moving targets issue.
Each of these modifications have their own pros and cons compared to the
others. The mentioned pros and cons mainly refer to the execution time required
for the corresponding algorithm and the stability provided by the corresponding
algorithm. Also, in terms of overestimation, none of the modifications seem to
underperform compared to the original Double-DQN if not outperform it. With the
intention of evaluating the efficacy of the proposed modifications, multiple
empirical experiments along with theoretical experiments were conducted. The
results obtained are represented and discussed in this article.

induce a multivariate Gaussian distribution for the normal class based on the
linkage between generative and discriminative modeling, and use the Mahalanobis
distance of normal images to the estimated distribution as training objective.
We additionally propose to use augmentations commonly employed for vicinal risk
minimization in a validation scheme to detect onset of catastrophic forgetting.
Extensive evaluations on the public MVTec dataset reveal that a new state of
the art is achieved by our method in the AD task while simultaneously achieving
anomaly segmentation performance comparable to prior state of the art. Further,
ablation studies demonstrate the importance of the induced Gaussian

theoretical proposal for realizing high temperature pairing of fermions in a

pairing mechanism for mobile dopants in antiferromagnetic Mott insulators,
which leads to binding energies proportional to $t^{1/3}$, where $t$ is the
hopping amplitude of the charge carriers. The pairing is caused by the energy
that one charge gains when retracing a string of frustrated bonds created by
another charge. Concretely, we show that this mechanism leads to the formation
of highly mobile, but tightly bound pairs in the case of mixed-dimensional
Fermi-Hubbard bilayer systems. This setting is closely related to the
Fermi-Hubbard model believed to capture the physics of copper oxides, and can
be realized by currently available ultracold atom experiments.

Interestingly, the optimal scheme exploits entanglement of Gaussian states only
among the modes assigned with equal signs of the weights, but separates the

domain-specific modeling and requires adequate (meta)-modeling frameworks. If
such systems are designed for the safety-critical area, the systems must
undergo qualification processes defined and monitored by a certification
authority. To use the resulting artifacts of modeling tools without further
qualification activities, the modeling tool must be additionally qualified.
Tool qualification has to be conducted by the tool user and can be assisted by
the tool developer by providing qualification artifacts. However,
state-of-the-art domain-specific modeling frameworks barely support the user in
the qualification process, which results in an extensive manual effort. To
reduce this effort and to avoid modeling constructs that can hardly be
implemented in a qualifiable way, we propose the development of an open source
(meta)-modeling framework that inherently considers qualification issues. Based
on the functionality of existing frameworks, we have identified components that
necessarily need to be rethought or changed. This leads to the consideration of
the following six cornerstones for our framework: (1) an essential
meta-language, (2) a minimal runtime, (3) deterministic transformations, (4) a
qualification artifact generation, (5) a sophisticated visualization, and (6) a
decoupled interaction of framework components. All these cornerstones consider
the aspect of a safety-critical (meta)-modeling framework in their own manner.
This combination leads to a holistic framework usable in the safety-critical

as a storage media with high density and capability of long-term preservation,
especially for archival storage systems. However, the encoding density (i.e.,
how many binary bits can be encoded into one nucleotide) and error handling are
two major factors intertwined in DNA storage. Considering encoding density,
theoretically, one nucleotide can encode two binary bits (upper bound).
However, due to biochemical constraints and other necessary information
associated with payload, the encoding densities of various DNA storage systems
are much less than this upper bound. Additionally, all existing studies of DNA
encoding schemes are based on static analysis and really lack the awareness of
dynamically changed digital patterns. Therefore, the gap between the static
encoding and dynamic binary patterns prevents achieving a higher encoding
density for DNA storage systems.
  In this paper, we propose a new Digital Pattern-Aware DNA storage system,
called DP-DNA, which can efficiently store digital data in DNA storage with
high encoding density. DP-DNA maintains a set of encoding codes and uses a
digital pattern-aware code (DPAC) to analyze the patterns of a binary sequence
for a DNA strand and selects an appropriate code for encoding the binary
sequence to achieve a high encoding density. An additional encoding field is
added to the DNA encoding format, which can distinguish the encoding scheme
used for those DNA strands, and thus we can decode DNA data back to its
original digital data. Moreover, to further improve the encoding density, a
variable-length scheme is proposed to increase the feasibility of the coding
scheme with a high encoding density. Finally, the experimental results indicate
that the proposed DP-DNA achieves up to 103.5% higher encoding densities than
prior work.

estimation in different dark energy models should be detailedly investigated.
Different from the usually considered $w(z)$-parameterized models in the
literature, in this work we investigate the holographic dark energy (HDE) model
and the Ricci dark energy (RDE) model, which originate from the holographic
principle of quantum gravity, using the simulated localized FRB data as a
cosmological probe for the first time. We show that the Hubble constant $H_0$
can be constrained to about 2% precision in the HDE model with the Macquart
relation of FRB by using 10000 accurately-localized FRBs combined with the
current CMB data, which is similar to the precision of the SH0ES value. Using
10000 localized FRBs combined with the CMB data can achieve about 6% constraint
on the dark-energy parameter $c$ in the HDE model, which is tighter than the
current BAO data combined with CMB. We also study the combination of the FRB
data and another low-redshift cosmological probe, i.e. gravitational wave (GW)
standard siren data, with the purpose of measuring cosmological parameters
independent of CMB. Although the parameter degeneracies inherent in FRB and in
GW are rather different, we find that more than 10000 FRBs are demanded to
effectively improve the constraints in the holographic dark energy models.

a microscopic theory of the CA engine is still lacking. By adopting the method
of the stochastic differential equation of energy, we formulate a microscopic
theory of the CA engine realized with an underdamped Brownian particle in a
class of non-harmonic potentials. This theory gives microscopic interpretation
of all assumptions made by Curzon and Ahlborn, and thus puts the results about

angular momentum to birefringent particles several wavelengths in size. A
trapped birefringent particle is much larger than the nano-particles systems
for which transverse angular momentum was previously investigated. The larger
birefringent particle interacts more strongly with both the trapping beam and
fluid surrounding it. This technique could be used to transfer transverse
angular momentum for studies of diverse micro-systems. Thus, it can be used for
investigation of the dynamics of complex fluids in 3D as well as for shear on
cell mono-layers. The trapping of such a particle with highly focused light is
complex and can lead to the emergence of effects such as spin--orbit coupling.
We estimate the transfer of spin angular momentum using Stokes measurements. We
outline the physics behind the construction of the beam used to control the
particles, perform quantitative measurement of transverse spin angular momentum
transfer, as well as demonstrate the generation of fluid flow around multiple
rotation axes.

  Convolutional Neural Networks",,,,,"q-bio.QM cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The Influenza virus can be considered as one of the most severe viruses that
can infect multiple species with often fatal consequences to the hosts. The
Hemagglutinin (HA) gene of the virus can be a target for antiviral drug
development realised through accurate identification of its sub-types and
possible the targeted hosts. This paper focuses on accurately predicting if an
Influenza type A virus can infect specific hosts, and more specifically, Human,
Avian and Swine hosts, using only the protein sequence of the HA gene. In more
detail, we propose encoding the protein sequences into numerical signals using
the Hydrophobicity Index and subsequently utilising a Convolutional Neural
Network-based predictive model. The Influenza HA protein sequences used in the
proposed work are obtained from the Influenza Research Database (IRD).
Specifically, complete and unique HA protein sequences were used for avian,
human and swine hosts. The data obtained for this work was 17999 human-host
proteins, 17667 avian-host proteins and 9278 swine-host proteins. Given this
set of collected proteins, the proposed method yields as much as 10% higher
accuracy for an individual class (namely, Avian) and 5% higher overall accuracy
than in an earlier study. It is also observed that the accuracy for each class
in this work is more balanced than what was presented in this earlier study. As
the results show, the proposed model can distinguish HA protein sequences with
high accuracy whenever the virus under investigation can infect Human, Avian or
Swine hosts.

proper functioning of a power system, in which the fluctuations in frequency

desynchronization, which may lead to widespread power outages. Here, we derive
explicit formulas that relate the fluctuations to the disturbances, and we
reveal the role of system parameters. In particular, the relationship between
synchronization stability and network theory is established, which
characterizes the impact of the network topology on the fluctuations. Our
analysis provides guidelines for the system parameter assignments and the
design of the network topology to suppress the fluctuations and further enhance
the synchronization stability of future smart grids integrated with a large

investigated the influence of middle turbinate resection on the deposition of
inhaled pollutants that cover spherical and non-spherical particles (e.g.
pollen). A computational model of the nasal cavity from CT scans, and its
corresponding post-operative model with virtual surgery performed was created.
Two constant flow rates of 5_L/min, and 15_L/min were simulated under a laminar
flow field. Inhaled particles including pollen (non-spherical), and a spherical
particle with reference density of 1000 kg/m3 were introduced in the
surrounding atmosphere. The effect of surgery was most prominent in the less

relative to the original airway space. The left cavity produced an increase in
particle deposition at a flow rate of 15_L/min. The main particle deposition
mechanisms were inertial impaction, and to a lesser degree gravitational
sedimentation. The results are expected to provide insight into inhalation

initially satisfying an SU(2) $\times$ U(1) local symmetry mediating

component of the field associated with the (scalar) Higgs boson acquires a
non-vanishing expectation value, generating masses for weak vector bosons

  trustless synchronization and transaction inclusion verification",,,,,"cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  A new node joining a blockchain network first synchronizes with the network
to verify ledger state by downloading the entire ledger history.
  We present Aurora, a probabilistic algorithm that \textit{identifies honest
nodes} for transient or persistent communication in the presence of malicious
nodes in a blockchain network, or ceases operation if it is unable to do so.
The algorithm allows a node joining the network to make an informed decision
about its next synchronization step or to verify that a transaction is
contained in a valid ledger block without downloading the entire ledger or even
the header chain.
  The algorithm constructs a Directed Acyclic Graph on the network topology to
select a subset of nodes including a predefined number of honest nodes with a
given probability.
  It is evaluated on a Bitcoin-like network topology using an open-source
blockchain simulator. We investigate algorithm performance and analyze its
communication complexity. Our results show that the algorithm facilitates
trustless interactions of resource-constrained nodes with a blockchain network
containing malicious nodes to enable a leaner initial blockchain download or an
efficient and trustless transaction inclusion verification. Moreover, the
algorithm can be implemented without any changes to the existing consensus
protocol.

  for Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Indoor Positioning System",,,,,"eess.SP cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), Indoor
Positioning System (IPS) has attracted significant interest in academic
research. Ultra-Wideband (UWB) is an emerging technology that can be employed
for IPS as it offers centimetre-level accuracy. However, the UWB system still
faces several technical challenges in practice, one of which is
Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) signal propagation. Several machine learning
approaches have been applied for the NLoS component identification. However,
when the data contains a very small amount of NLoS components it becomes very
difficult for existing algorithms to classify them. This paper focuses on
employing an anomaly detection approach based on Gaussian Distribution (GD) and
Generalized Gaussian Distribution (GGD) algorithms to detect and identify the
NLoS components. The simulation results indicate that the proposed approach can
provide a robust NLoS component identification which improves the NLoS signal
classification accuracy which results in significant improvement in the UWB
positioning system.

personal experiences with other people. People often post their life
experiences, local news, and events on social media to inform others. Many
rescue agencies monitor this type of data regularly to identify disasters and
reduce the risk of lives. However, it is impossible for humans to manually
check the mass amount of data and identify disasters in real-time. For this
purpose, many research works have been proposed to present words in
machine-understandable representations and apply machine learning methods on
the word representations to identify the sentiment of a text. The previous
research methods provide a single representation or embedding of a word from a
given document. However, the recent advanced contextual embedding method (BERT)
constructs different vectors for the same word in different contexts. BERT
embeddings have been successfully used in different natural language processing
(NLP) tasks, yet there is no concrete analysis of how these representations are
helpful in disaster-type tweet analysis. In this research work, we explore the
efficacy of BERT embeddings on predicting disaster from Twitter data and
compare these to traditional context-free word embedding methods (GloVe,
Skip-gram, and FastText). We use both traditional machine learning methods and
deep learning methods for this purpose. We provide both quantitative and
qualitative results for this study. The results show that the BERT embeddings
have the best results in disaster prediction task than the traditional word
embeddings. Our codes are made freely accessible to the research community.

is used to accelerate the operations performed on each processor. Numerical
experiments have been performed on a set of matrices arising from engineering

the sub-structuring method up to 19 times in double precision by using CUDA.

meaning is different from what is implied by its surface meaning. It finds
applications in many NLP tasks such as opinion mining, sentiment analysis, etc.
Today, social media has given rise to an abundant amount of multimodal data
where users express their opinions through text and images. Our paper aims to
leverage multimodal data to improve the performance of the existing systems for
sarcasm detection. So far, various approaches have been proposed that uses text
and image modality and a fusion of both. We propose a novel architecture that
uses the RoBERTa model with a co-attention layer on top to incorporate context
incongruity between input text and image attributes. Further, we integrate
feature-wise affine transformation by conditioning the input image through
FiLMed ResNet blocks with the textual features using the GRU network to capture
the multimodal information. The output from both the models and the CLS token
from RoBERTa is concatenated and used for the final prediction. Our results
demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art
method by 6.14% F1 score on the public Twitter multimodal sarcasm detection
dataset.
