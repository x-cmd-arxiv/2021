temporally second order compact scheme for incompressible Navier-Stokes (N-S)
equations in time-varying domain. Sen [J. Comput. Phys. 251 (2013) 251-271] put
forward an implicit compact finite difference scheme for the unsteady
convection-diffusion equation. It is now further extended to simulate fluid
flow problems on deformable surfaces using curvilinear moving grids. The
formulation is conceptualized in conjunction with recent advances in numerical
grid deformations techniques such as inverse distance weighting (IDW)
interpolation and its hybrid implementation. Adequate emphasis is provided to
approximate grid metrics up to the desired level of accuracy and freestream
preserving property has been numerically examined. As we discretize the
non-conservative form of the N-S equation, the importance of accurate
satisfaction of geometric conservation law (GCL) is investigated. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first higher order compact method that can
directly tackle non-conservative form of N-S equation in single and multi-block
time dependent complex regions. Several numerical verification and validation
studies are carried out to illustrate the flexibility of the approach to handle
high-order approximations on evolving geometries.

clinical decision support and clinical research. Current models do not take
full advantage of cancer domain-specific corpus, whether pre-training
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer model on cancer-specific
corpus could improve the performances of extracting breast cancer phenotypes
from texts data remains to be explored. The objective of this study is to
develop and evaluate the CancerBERT model for extracting breast cancer
phenotypes from clinical texts in electronic health records. This data used in
the study included 21,291 breast cancer patients diagnosed from 2010 to 2020,
patients' clinical notes and pathology reports were collected from the
University of Minnesota Clinical Data Repository (UMN). Results: About 3
million clinical notes and pathology reports in electronic health records for
21,291 breast cancer patients were collected to train the CancerBERT model. 200
pathology reports and 50 clinical notes of breast cancer patients that contain
9,685 sentences and 221,356 tokens were manually annotated by two annotators.
20% of the annotated data was used as a test set. Our CancerBERT model achieved
the best performance with macro F1 scores equal to 0.876 (95% CI, 0.896-0.902)
for exact match and 0.904 (95% CI, 0.896-0.902) for the lenient match. The NER
models we developed would facilitate the automated information extraction from
clinical texts to further help clinical decision support. Conclusions and
Relevance: In this study, we focused on the breast cancer-related concepts
extraction from EHR data and obtained a comprehensive annotated dataset that
contains 7 types of breast cancer-related concepts. The CancerBERT model with
customized vocabulary could significantly improve the performance for
extracting breast cancer phenotypes from clinical texts.

CSG-Stump Net, an unsupervised end-to-end network for learning shapes from

layer in the middle, and a union layer at the top. CSG-Stump is proven to be
equivalent to CSG in terms of representation, therefore inheriting the
interpretable, compact and editable nature of CSG while freeing from CSG's
complex tree structures. Particularly, the CSG-Stump has a simple and regular
structure, allowing neural networks to give outputs of a constant

characteristics of CSG-Stump, CSG-Stump Net achieves superior results compared
to previous CSG-based methods and generates much more appealing shapes, as

by showing that for each set $A$ consisting of positive integers

there exists a unique (up to reversal) cyclic word $x$ which maximizes (resp.
minimizes) the regular cyclic continuant $K^{\circlearrowright}(\cdot)$ amongst
all cyclic words over $A$ with Parikh vector $(n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_k)$. We also
show that the same is true for the minimizing arrangement for the semi-regular
cyclic continuant $\dot K^{\circlearrowright}(\cdot)$. As in the non-cyclic
case, the main difficulty is to find the maximizing arrangement for the
semi-regular continuant, which is not unique in general and may depend on the
integers $a_1,\ldots,a_k$ and not just on their relative order. We show that if
a cyclic word $x$ maximizes $\dot K^{\circlearrowright}(\cdot)$ amongst all

call the singular property. We develop an algorithm for constructing all

of sequential recommender systems by achieving state-of-the-art recommendation
performance on various sequential recommendation tasks. Given a sequence of
interacted items, existing DNN-based sequential recommenders commonly embed
each item into a unique vector to support subsequent computations of the user
interest. However, due to the potentially large number of items, the
over-parameterised item embedding matrix of a sequential recommender has become
a memory bottleneck for efficient deployment in resource-constrained
environments, e.g., smartphones and other edge devices. Furthermore, we observe
that the widely-used multi-head self-attention, though being effective in
modelling sequential dependencies among items, heavily relies on redundant
attention units to fully capture both global and local item-item transition
patterns within a sequence.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel lightweight self-attentive network (LSAN)
for sequential recommendation. To aggressively compress the original embedding
matrix, LSAN leverages the notion of compositional embeddings, where each item
embedding is composed by merging a group of selected base embedding vectors
derived from substantially smaller embedding matrices. Meanwhile, to account
for the intrinsic dynamics of each item, we further propose a temporal
context-aware embedding composition scheme. Besides, we develop an innovative
twin-attention network that alleviates the redundancy of the traditional
multi-head self-attention while retaining full capacity for capturing long- and
short-term (i.e., global and local) item dependencies. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that LSAN significantly advances the accuracy and

thermal machines. In contrast to most of the previous proposals based on
discrete strokes, here we consider a working substance that is permanently
coupled to two or more baths at different temperatures and continuously driven.
To this end, we investigate parametrically driven quantum harmonic oscillators
coupled to heat baths via a collision model. Using a thermodynamically
consistent local master equation, we derive the heat flows and power of the
working device which can operate as an engine, refrigerator or accelerator and
analyze the instantaneous and average efficiencies and coefficients of
performance. Studying the regimes of both slow and fast driving of the system,
we find that an increased driving frequency can lead to a change of functioning
to a dissipator. Finally, we investigate the effect of squeezing one of the
thermal baths: it leads to an apparent higher efficiency compared to the
corresponding Carnot value of an equilibrium bath with the same temperature and
to sustained entanglement between the working substance oscillators in the
limit cycle.

of the average treatment effect exists which is uniformly consistent without
further assumptions, (2) knowledge of the propensity score yields a uniformly
consistent estimator and honest confidence intervals that shrink at parametric
rates with increasing sample size, regardless of how complicated the propensity
score function is. We emphasize the latter point, and note that
successfully-conducted RCTs provide knowledge of the propensity score to the
researcher. We discuss modern developments in covariate adjustment for RCTs,
noting that statistical models and machine learning methods can be used to
improve efficiency while preserving finite sample unbiasedness. We conclude
that statistical inference has the potential to be fundamentally more difficult
in observational settings than it is in RCTs, even when all confounders are
measured.

provable advantage over classical algorithms in fault-tolerant settings. There
is also interest in quantum algorithms and the experiments that implement these
algorithms for NISQ settings. In these settings, various sources of noise and
error need to be accounted for when executing any experiments. Recently, NISQ
devices have been verified as versatile testbeds for open quantum systems. It
has been demonstrated that NISQ devices can simulate simple quantum channels.
Our goal is to apply NISQ devices to the more complicated problem of simulating
convex mixtures of quantum channels. We consider two specific cases; convex
mixtures of Markovian channels that result in a non-Markovian channel (M+M=nM)
and convex mixtures of non-Markovian channels that result in a Markovian
channel (nM+nM=M). For our first case, we consider convex mixtures of
Non-Markovian depolarising channels. For our second case, we consider convex
mixtures of Markovian Pauli channels. We show that efficient circuits, that
account for the topology of currently available devices and current levels of
decoherence, can be constructed by avoiding traditional approaches such as
Stinespring Dilation etc. We also present a strategy for the implementation of
a process tomography that yields a CPTP channel.

question I intend to address is, 'has Bangladesh experienced security threat
due to massive Rohingya influx?' If so in what ways? I test four security
threat areas: societal security, economic security, internal security, and
public security. I have used newspaper content analysis over past three years
along with interview data collected from interviewing local people in coxs
bazar area where the Rohingya camps are located. To assess if the threats are
low level, medium level, or high level, I investigated both the frequency of

experience any serious security threats over the last three years. There are
some criminal activities and offenses, but these are only low-level security
threat at best. My research presents empirical evidence that challenges
conventional assertions that refugees are security threats or challenges to the

independent observations is studied. The pre-change distribution is assumed to
be stationary, while the post-change distributions are allowed to be
non-stationary. The case where the pre-change distribution is known is studied
first, and then the extension where only the mean and variance of the
pre-change distribution are known. No knowledge of the post-change
distributions is assumed other than that their means are above some
pre-specified threshold larger than the pre-change mean. For the case where the
pre-change distribution is known, a test is derived that asymptotically
minimizes the worst-case detection delay over all possible post-change
distributions, as the false alarm rate goes to zero. Towards deriving this
asymptotically optimal test, some new results are provided for the general
problem of asymptotic minimax robust quickest change detection in
non-stationary settings. Then, the limiting form of the optimal test is studied
as the gap between the pre- and post-change means goes to zero, called the
Mean-Change Test (MCT). It is shown that the MCT can be designed with only
knowledge of the mean and variance of the pre-change distribution. The
performance of the MCT is also characterized when the mean gap is moderate,
under the additional assumption that the distributions of the observations have
bounded support. The analysis is validated through numerical results for
detecting a change in the mean of a beta distribution. The use of the MCT in
monitoring pandemics is also demonstrated.

time-division-duplexing (TDD) systems. This is motivated in FDD since uplink
and downlink transmissions occur simultaneously and hence an IRS must be
jointly configured for both transmissions. In TDD, while a joint design is not
strictly necessary, it can significantly reduce feedback overhead, power
consumption, and configuration periods associated with updating the IRS. To
compute the trade-off between uplink and downlink rates achieved by a joint
design, a weighted-sum problem is formulated and optimized using a developed
block-coordinate descent algorithm. The resulting uplink-downlink trade-off
regions are investigated by numerical simulation to gain insights into
different scenarios. In all FDD scenarios and some TDD scenarios, the jointly
optimized design significantly outperforms the fixed-uplink (fixed-downlink)
heuristic of using the IRS configuration optimized for uplink (downlink) to
assist downlink (uplink) transmissions. Moreover, the joint design
substantially bridges the gap to the individual design upper bound of allowing
different IRS configurations in uplink and downlink. Otherwise, in the
remaining TDD scenarios, the fixed-uplink and fixed-downlink designs nearly
achieve the individual design performance and substantially reduce overhead
and/or complexity compared to the optimized joint design and individual design.

(e.g., ImageNet model on classification) to train a single general student
model. Our approach has three steps. First, we train specialized teachers
independently on labeled datasets. We then use the specialized teachers to
label an unlabeled dataset to create a multi-task pseudo labeled dataset.
Finally, the dataset, which now contains pseudo labels from teacher models
trained on different datasets/tasks, is then used to train a student model with
multi-task learning. We evaluate the feature representations of the student
model on 6 vision tasks including image recognition (classification, detection,
segmentation)and 3D geometry estimation (depth and surface normal estimation).
MuST is scalable with unlabeled or partially labeled datasets and outperforms
both specialized supervised models and self-supervised models when training on
large scale datasets. Lastly, we show MuST can improve upon already strong
checkpoints trained with billions of examples. The results suggest
self-training is a promising direction to aggregate labeled and unlabeled

as, or sometimes even faster than, the constituent two-qubit gates.
Furthermore, these multi-qubit gates do not require any modification of the
quantum processor, but are ready to be used in current quantum-computing
platforms. We demonstrate this idea for two specific cases: simultaneous
controlled-Z gates and simultaneous iSWAP gates. We show how the resulting
multi-qubit gates relate to other well-known multi-qubit gates and demonstrate
through numerical simulations that they would work well in available quantum
hardware, reaching gate fidelities well above 99 %. We also present schemes for
using these simultaneous two-qubit gates to swiftly create large entangled
states like Dicke and Greenberg-Horne-Zeilinger states.

many areas of science and engineering, with much potential for a speedup on
quantum devices. While the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) quantum algorithm yields
up to an exponential speed-up over classical algorithms in some cases, it
requires a fault-tolerant quantum computer, which is unlikely to be available
in the near term. Thus, attention has turned to the investigation of quantum
algorithms for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices where several
near-term approaches to solving systems of linear equations have been proposed.
This paper focuses on the Variational Quantum Linear Solvers (VQLS), and other
closely related methods. This paper makes several contributions that include:
the first application of the Evolutionary Ansatz to the VQLS (EAVQLS), the
first implementation of the Logical Ansatz VQLS (LAVQLS), based on the
Classical Combination of Quantum States (CQS) method, the first proof of
principle demonstration of the CQS method on real quantum hardware and a method
for the implementation of the Adiabatic Ansatz (AAVQLS). These approaches are
implemented and contrasted.

%various intriguing phenomena, including Mott transitions and

trilayer case, a strong electron-hole doping asymmetry has been observed in the
superconducting phase, which is absent in the three-dimensional bulk limit.
Using density-functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory, we show that
this doping asymmetry results from a substantial charge reshuffling from the
top layer to the middle layer. While the nominal filling per fullerene is close
to $n=3$, the top layer rapidly switches to an $n=2$ insulating state upon hole
doping, which \textcolor{black}{implies a} doping asymmetry of the
superconducting gap. The interlayer charge transfer and layer-selective
metal-insulator transition result from the interplay between crystal field
splittings, strong Coulomb interactions, and an effectively negative Hund
coupling. This peculiar charge reshuffling is absent in the monolayer system,
which is an $n=3$ Mott insulator, as expected from the nominal filling.

normalizing flows, coupled with both maximum-likelihood and adversarial
training. We model a source domain (labels available) and a target domain
(labels unavailable) with individual normalizing flows, and perform domain
alignment to a common latent space using adversarial discriminators. Due to the
invertible property of flow models, the mapping has exact cycle consistency. We
also learn the joint distribution of the data samples and attributes in the
source domain by employing an encoder to map attributes to the latent space via
adversarial training. During the synthesis phase, given any combination of
attributes, our method can generate synthetic samples conditioned on them in
the target domain. Empirical studies confirm the effectiveness of our method on
benchmarked datasets. We envision our method to be particularly useful for
synthetic data generation in label-scarce systems by generating non-trivial
augmentations via attribute transformations. These synthetic samples will
introduce more entropy into the label-scarce domain than their geometric and
photometric transformation counterparts, helpful for robust downstream tasks.

a quasi-2D annular shear cell with a rotating inner wall and a fixed outer
wall. Each type of particle is found to exhibit flows which are well-fit by
nonlocal rheology, with each particle having a distinct triad of the local,
nonlocal, and frictional parameters. While the local parameter b is always
approximately unity, the nonlocal parameter A depends sensitively on both the

significantly worse test error in many deep learning applications such as image
classification, even with a fine-tuned regularization. In this paper, we
provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon: we show that in the
nonconvex setting of learning over-parameterized two-layer convolutional neural
networks starting from the same random initialization, for a class of data
distributions (inspired from image data), Adam and gradient descent (GD) can
converge to different global solutions of the training objective with provably
different generalization errors, even with weight decay regularization. In
contrast, we show that if the training objective is convex, and the weight
decay regularization is employed, any optimization algorithms including Adam
and GD will converge to the same solution if the training is successful. This
suggests that the inferior generalization performance of Adam is fundamentally
tied to the nonconvex landscape of deep learning optimization.

long been considered as one of the best candidates for very high-energy (VHE;
>100 GeV) gamma-ray emission. Using 11.5 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope
(LAT) data between 100 MeV and 870 GeV, and ~90 hours of MAGIC observations in
the 20 GeV to 20 TeV range, we have searched for the highest energy gamma-ray
emission from PSR J0218+4232. Based on the analysis of the LAT data, we find
evidence for pulsed emission above 25 GeV, but see no evidence for emission
above 100 GeV (VHE) with MAGIC. We present the results of searches for
gamma-ray emission, along with theoretical modeling, to interpret the lack of
VHE emission. We conclude that, based on the experimental observations and
theoretical modeling, it will remain extremely challenging to detect VHE
emission from PSR J0218+4232 with the current generation of Imaging Atmospheric
Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs), and maybe even with future ones, such as the

below the Planck scale. This tower can consist of low-spin states, as in
Kaluza-Klein theory, or high-spin states, as with weakly-coupled strings. We
provide a suggestive bottom-up argument based on the mild $p$-form WGC that,
for any gauge theory coupled to a fundamental axion through a $\theta F \wedge

below the WGC scale $g M_\mathrm{Pl}$ are simply axion strings for $\theta$,
with charged modes arising from anomaly inflow. Kaluza-Klein theories evade
this conclusion and postpone the appearance of high-spin states to higher
energies because they lack a $\theta F \wedge F$ term. For abelian Kaluza-Klein
theories, modified arguments based on additional abelian groups that interact
with the Kaluza-Klein gauge group sometimes pinpoint a mass scale for charged

String Conjectures. We emphasize the unproven assumptions and weak points of
the arguments, which provide interesting targets for further work. In

matter in the early universe provides a novel avenue towards resolving the

Background era observables. However, such a mechanism requires a hidden sector
whose energy density ratios are the same as in our sector and whose
recombination also takes place at redshift $z \approx 1100$, which presents an
apparent fine tuning. We introduce a realistic model of this scenario that
dynamically enforces these coincidences without fine tuning. In our setup, the
hidden sector contains an identical copy of Standard Model (SM) fields, but has
a smaller Higgs vacuum expectation value (VEV) and a lower temperature. The
baryon asymmetries and reheating temperatures in both sectors arise from the
decays of an Affleck-Dine scalar field, whose branching ratios automatically
ensure that the reheating temperature in each sector is proportional to the
corresponding Higgs VEV. The same setup also naturally ensures that the
Hydrogen binding energy in each sector is proportional to the corresponding
VEV, so the ratios of binding energy to temperature are approximately equal in
the two sectors. Furthermore, our scenario predicts a correlation between the
SM/hidden temperature ratio and the atomic dark matter abundance and
automatically yields values for these quantities favored by concordant early-
and late-universe measurements of $H_0$.

unstable disks have clear kinematic imprints into the gas component across the
entire disk extent, due to the GI spiral wave perturbation, resulting in

We apply this generalized gauging map to convert global-symmetric bulk systems
of holographic codes to gauge-symmetric bulk systems, and vice versa, while
preserving duality with a global-symmetric boundary. We separately construct
holographic codes with gauge-symmetric bulk systems by directly imposing
gauge-invariance constraints onto existing holographic codes, and show that the
resulting bulk gauge symmetries are dual to boundary global symmetries.
Combining these ideas produces a toy model that captures several interesting
features of holography - it exhibits a rudimentary sort of dynamical duality,
can be modified to demonstrate the relationship between metric fluctuations and
approximate error-correction, and serves as an illustration for certain no-go
theorems concerning symmetries in holography. Finally, we apply the generalized

including a misaligned orbit (${240.34^{+0.93}_{-0.98}}$ degrees) and nearly

fast-rotating F0 host star ($T_{\mathrm{eff}} \simeq 7300$ K) in 1.9 days and
experiences intense irradiation. Notably, the TESS data show a clear secondary
eclipse with a depth of $364\pm28$ ppm and a significant phase curve signal,
from which we obtain a relative day-night planetary flux difference of roughly
320 ppm and a 5.2$\sigma$ detection of ellipsoidal distortion on the host star.

Jupiter atmospheres, we conduct an atmospheric cross-correlation analysis. We
detect neutral iron (${5.2\sigma}$), at $K_p = 157^{+68}_{-44}$ km s$^{-1}$ and
$V_{\rm sys} = -16^{+2}_{-4}$ km s$^{-1}$, adding another object to the small
sample of highly irradiated gas-giant planets with Fe detections in
transmission. Detections so far favor particularly inflated gas giants with
radii $\gtrsim 1.78\,R_{\rm J}$; although this may be due to observational
bias. With an equilibrium temperature of $T_{\rm eq}=2492\pm38$ K and a
measured dayside brightness temperature of $3237\pm59$ K (assuming zero
geometric albedo), TOI-1518b is a promising candidate for future emission

recently uncovered: this theory is dual to an ensemble of quantum mechanical
theories; and such ensemble is described by a random matrix model which itself
may be regarded as a special (large matter-central-charge) limit of minimal
string theory. This work addresses this limit, putting it in its broader
matrix-model context; comparing results between multicritical models and
minimal strings (i.e., changing in-between multicritical and conformal
backgrounds); and in both cases making the limit of large matter-central-charge
precise (as such limit can also be defined for the multicritical series). These
analyses are first done via spectral geometry, at both perturbative and
nonperturbative levels, addressing the resurgent large-order growth of
perturbation theory, alongside a calculation of nonperturbative
instanton-actions and corresponding Stokes data. This calculation requires an
algorithm to reach large-order, which is valid for arbitrary two-dimensional
topological gravity. String equations -- as derived from the GD construction of
the resolvent -- are analyzed in both multicritical and minimal string
theoretic contexts, and studied both perturbatively and nonperturbatively
(always matching against the earlier spectral-geometry computations). The
resulting solutions, as described by resurgent transseries, are shown to be
resonant. The large matter-central-charge limit is addressed -- in the
string-equation context -- and, in particular, the string equation for JT
gravity is obtained to next derivative-orders, beyond the known genus-zero case

needs both the finite-temperature canonical distribution function and the
reaction current between the reactant and product states, to completely
characterize the dynamic. Here we show how to tackle this problem using a
quantum computer. We use the connection between a classical stochastic dynamics
and the Schroedinger equation, also known as stochastic quantization, to
variationally prepare quantum states allowing us to unbiasedly sample from a
Boltzmann distribution. Similarly, reaction rate constants can be computed as
ground state energies of suitably transformed operators, following the
supersymmetric extension of the formalism. Finally, we propose a hybrid
quantum-classical sampling scheme to escape local minima, and explore the
configuration space in both real-space and spin hamiltonians. We indicate how
to realize the quantum algorithms constructively, without assuming the
existence of oracles, or quantum walk operators. The quantum advantage

based on the known characteristics of ACV variables, candidate ACV stars were
selected from the ZTF Catalog of Periodic Variable Stars. All light curves were
inspected in detail to select the most promising candidates. Where available,
low-resolution spectra from the LAMOST were employed to classify the stars on
the MK system and confirm their status as mCP stars. We have identified 86 new
promising ACV star candidates. 15 of these stars have LAMOST spectra available,
which, in all cases, confirm them as classical mCP stars, which highlights the
viability of our approach. The sample stars can be sorted into four subgroups
characterized by distinct light curve shapes. Anti-phase variations in
different photometric passbands, in particular, is a unique characteristic of a
subset of ACV stars readily usable for their identification. The availability
of data in three different passbands (g, r, and i) is a major advantage of the
ZTF survey. On the basis of our experience with other photometric surveys and
the analysis of light curves, we conclude that the ZTF is well suited for the

integration over the asymmetries in the GRB jet where optical photons
originate; $\Pi_\gamma$ follows a similar evolution as $\Pi_\mathrm{opt}$ with
smaller polarization degrees. We also show that $\Pi_\mathrm{opt}$ and

improved rapid-exploring random tree (RRT) for planning a feasible trajectory
from a given start point to a parking lot, and a path smoothing module for
optimizing the efficiency of parking tasks. Our algorithm is based on a real
kinematic vehicle model; which makes it more suitable for algorithm application
on real autonomous cars. Furthermore, due to the introduction of the
imagination mechanism, the processing speed of our algorithm is ten times
faster than that of traditional methods, permitting the realization of
real-time planning simultaneously. In order to evaluate the algorithm's

in quantum spin models, where the heating rate is exponentially small in the

shown that prethermalization occurs also in classical systems with an infinite

the lifetime of the prethermal state in these systems. We, first, numerically
study the dependence of the lifetime on the initial conditions and on the
connectivity in a system of periodically driven coupled rotors. We find that
the lifetime is controlled by the temperature of the prethermal state, which is
quasi-conserved when the heating is slow. This finding allows us to develop a

particular, for temperatures $T\gtrsim t$ the electrical resistivity is nearly

is non-linear and changes by nearly an order of magnitude. We argue that this
asymptotic behavior is a general feature of systems with a finite spectral

single-band models. Due to nesting, the $T$-linear resistivity persists down to
$T=0$ at half filling. Our work sheds light on the transport regime in
ultracold atom experiments, which can differ substantially from that of
condensed matter systems. Disentangling these band-structure effects from the
physics of strong correlations is a major challenge for future experiments.

extensive efficient accelerator designs, from traditional electronics to

problem. Besides, we propose a novel online PGT refinement approach to steadily

the second-phase training, decoupling the first and second-phase models.
Elaborate experiments are conducted on the PASCAL VOC 2007 benchmark to verify

convolutions are two promising techniques to accelerate DNN inference on the
edge. Interestingly, their combination is inefficient: Computational patterns
of depthwise separable convolutions do not exhibit a rhythmic systolic flow and
lack sufficient data reuse to saturate systolic arrays. We formally analyse
this inefficiency and propose an efficient operator, an optimal hardware
dataflow, and a superior training methodology towards alleviating this. The
efficient operator, called FuSeConv, is a drop-in replacement for depthwise
separable convolutions. FuSeConv factorizes convolution fully along their
spatial and depth dimensions. The resultant computation efficiently maps to
systolic arrays. The optimal dataflow, called Spatial-Tiled Output Stationary
(ST-OS), maximizes the efficiency of FuSeConv on systolic arrays. It maps
independent convolutions to rows of the array to maximize resource utilization
with negligible VLSI overheads. Neural Operator Scaffolding (NOS) scaffolds the
training of FuSeConv by distilling knowledge from the expensive depthwise
separable convolutions. This bridges the accuracy gap between FuSeConv networks
and baselines. Additionally, NOS can be combined with Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) to trade-off latency and accuracy. The HW/SW co-design of FuSeConv
with ST-OS achieves a significant speedup of 4.1-9.25X with state-of-the-art
efficient networks for ImageNet. The parameter efficiency of FuSeConv and its
significant out-performance over depthwise separable convolutions on systolic
arrays illustrates their promise as a strong solution on the edge. Training
FuSeConv networks with NOS achieves accuracy comparable to the baselines.
Further, by combining NOS with NAS, we design networks that define
state-of-the-art models improving on both accuracy and latency on systolic
arrays.

irreversible morphological modifications reflect structural heterogeneities
across the cathode particles due to formation of various domains with different

suggest that the latter inorganic species in the cycled electrode are mainly
composed of NaF, Na2O, and NaCO3 formed by parasitic electrolyte decomposition.
The precipitation of these insulating compounds at the electrode/electrolyte

a decrease in cathode particle size and partial loss of electrochemical
activity. The retention of the NCAM phase after cycling suggests that

function phase change as the device is subjected either to a transverse
acceleration or vibrations. We provide numerical evidence for the feasibility
of SQUID-based accelerometers that can be used for transverse acceleration and
oscillatory motion measurement.

  accepted",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We propose a novel framework for comparing 3D human shapes under the change
of shape and pose. This problem is challenging since 3D human shapes vary
significantly across subjects and body postures. We solve this problem by using
a Riemannian approach. Our core contribution is the mapping of the human body
surface to the space of metrics and normals. We equip this space with a family
of Riemannian metrics, called Ebin (or DeWitt) metrics. We treat a human body
surface as a point in a ""shape space"" equipped with a family of Riemannian
metrics. The family of metrics is invariant under rigid motions and
reparametrizations; hence it induces a metric on the ""shape space"" of surfaces.
Using the alignment of human bodies with a given template, we show that this
family of metrics allows us to distinguish the changes in shape and pose. The
proposed framework has several advantages. First, we define a family of metrics
with desired invariance properties for the comparison of human shape. Second,
we present an efficient framework to compute geodesic paths between human shape
given the chosen metric. Third, this framework provides some basic tools for
statistical shape analysis of human body surfaces. Finally, we demonstrate the
utility of the proposed framework in pose and shape retrieval of human body.

the Galactic distribution of planets as a function of distance from the
Galactic center. The Galactic location of a lens system can be uniquely
determined only when at least two of the three quantities that determine the
mass--distance relations are measured. However, even if only one mass--distance
relation can be obtained, a large sample of microlensing events can be used to
statistically discuss the Galactic distribution of the lenses. In this study,
we extract the Galactic distribution of planetary systems from the distribution
of the lens-source proper motion, $\mu_{\rm rel}$, for a given Einstein radius
crossing time, $t_{\rm E}$, measured for the 28 planetary events in the
statistical sample by Suzuki et al. (2016). Because microlensing is randomly
caused by stars in our Galaxy, the observational distribution can be predicted
using a Galactic model. We incorporate the planet-hosting probability, $P_{\rm
host} \propto M_{\rm L}^m R_{\rm L}^r$, into a Galactic model for
random-selected stars, where $M_{\rm L}$ is the lens mass ($\sim$ host mass),
and $R_{\rm L}$ is the Galactocentric distance. By comparing the observed
distribution with the model-predicted $\mu_{\rm rel}$ distribution for a given
$t_{\rm E}$ at various combinations of $(m ,r)$, we obtain an estimate $r = 0.2
\pm 0.4$ under a plausible uniform prior for $m$ of $0<m<2$. This indicates
that the dependence of the planet frequency on the Galactocentric distance is
not large, and suggests that the Galactic bulge does have planets.

secondary BH masses for current LIGO/Virgo/Kagra gravitational wave detections.
The importance of gravitational recoil is estimated statistically. We present
several possible formation paths of massive BHs above the assumed lower PISNe
mass-gap limit ($45 M_\odot$) into the intermediate-mass BH (IMBH) regime ($>
100 M_\odot$) which include collisions of stars and BHs as well as the direct
collapse of stellar merger remnants with low mass cores. The stellar evolution
updates result in the early formation of higher mass stellar BHs than for the
previous model. The resulting higher collision rates with massive stars support
the rapid formation of massive BHs. For models assuming a high accretion
efficiency for star-BH mergers, we present a first-generation formation
scenario for GW190521-like events, a merger of two BHs in the PISN mass-gap,
which is dominated by star-BH mergers. This IMBH formation path is independent
of gravitational recoil and therefore conceivable in dense stellar systems with

training the model on actively selected informative and/or representative

learns from a large amount of unlabeled data in an unsupervised way and
fine-tunes on few labeled samples. Recent developments in self-training have
achieved very impressive results rivaling supervised learning on some datasets.
The current work focuses on whether the two paradigms can benefit from each
other. We studied object recognition datasets including CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and
Tiny ImageNet with several labeling budgets for the evaluations. Our
experiments reveal that self-training is remarkably more efficient than active
learning at reducing the labeling effort, that for a low labeling budget,
active learning offers no benefit to self-training, and finally that the
combination of active learning and self-training is fruitful when the labeling
budget is high. The performance gap between active learning trained either with
self-training or from scratch diminishes as we approach to the point where
almost half of the dataset is labeled.

binarization to reduce the computational complexity is explored. The pruned

networks is compared against several state-of-the-art algorithms.

  Responses for Small Watersheds",,,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Understanding dynamics of hydrological responses is essential in producing
skillful runoff forecast. This can be quantitatively done by tracking changes
in hydrology model parameters that represent physical characteristics. In this
study, we implement a Bayesian estimation method in continuously estimating
hydrology model parameters given observations of rainfall and runoff for small
watersheds. The method is coupled with a conceptual hydrology model using a
Gamma distribution-based Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph. The whole analytical
framework is tested using synthetic data as well as observational data from the
Fall Creek watershed. The results show that the Bayesian method can well track
the hidden parameters that change inter-annually. Then the model is applied to
examine temporal and spatial variability of the rainfall-runoff responses and
we find 1) a systematic shift in the rainfall-runoff response for the Fall
Creek watershed around 1943 and 2) a statistically significant relationship
between rainfall-runoff responses and watershed sizes for selected NY
watersheds. Our results demonstrate potential of the Bayesian estimation method
as a rapid surveillance tool in monitoring and tracking changes of hydrological
responses for small watersheds.

presents a bandwidth allocation (BA) model that allows one to adapt the
bandwidth allocated to users depending on their data rate needs. Specifically,
in adaptive BA, a wide bandwidth is divided into chunks of smaller bandwidths
and the number of bandwidth chunks allocated to a user depends on its needs or
type. Although BWP in 5G NR mandates allocation of a set of contiguous
bandwidth chunks, our BA model also allows other assumptions on chunk
allocation such as the allocation of any set of bandwidth chunks, as in, e.g.,
LTE resource allocation, where chunks are selected uniformly at random. The BA
model studied here is probabilistic in that the user locations are assumed to
form a realization of a Poisson point process and each user decides
independently to be of a certain type with some probability. This model allows
one to quantify spectrum sharing and service differentiation in this context,
namely to predict what performance a user gets depending on its type as well as
the overall performance. This is based on exact representations of key
performance metrics for each user type, namely its success probability, the
meta distribution of its signal-to-interference ratio, and its Shannon
throughput. We show that, surprisingly, the higher traffic variability stemming
from adaptive BA is beneficial: when comparing two networks using adaptive BA
and having the same mean signal and the same mean interference powers, the
network with higher traffic variability performs better for all these
performance metrics. With respect to Shannon throughput, we observe that our BA
model is roughly egalitarian per Hertz and leads to a linear service
differentiation in aggregated throughput value.

extraordinary control of the electronic bands' properties, for example by
varying the relative twist angle between the layers forming the system. In
particular, in twisted bilayers the low energy bands can be tuned to be very
flat and with a nontrivial quantum metric. This allows the quantitative and

the general connection between quantum metric and the properties of correlated

latter, uses an ANN index and approximate scores to identify a set of candidate
documents for each query embedding, which are then re-ranked using accurate
document representations. In this manner, a large number of documents can be
retrieved for each query, hindering the efficiency of the approach. In this
work, we investigate the use of ANN scores for ranking the candidate documents,
in order to decrease the number of candidate documents being fully scored.
Experiments conducted on the MSMARCO passage ranking corpus demonstrate that,
by cutting of the candidate set by using the approximate scores to only 200
documents, we can still obtain an effective ranking without statistically
significant differences in effectiveness, and resulting in a 2x speedup in
efficiency.

most common techniques in the current clinical workflow that enables
noninvasive and instantaneous evaluation of blood flow velocity within the

through the skull's acoustic windows. Our deep learning framework employs
in-vivo real-time TCD velocity measurements at several locations in the brain
and the baseline vessel cross-sectional areas acquired from 3D angiography
images, and provides high-resolution maps of velocity, area, and pressure in

finding here is that the combined effects of uncertainties in outlet boundary

and high transferred momentum as a probe for the short distance structure in
nuclei. In this reaction, an electron hits a nucleus of deuterium, which breaks
up into a proton-neutron pair. We focus our attention on events where fast
nucleons emerge, corresponding to nuclear configurations where the bound
nucleons have a high relative momentum (exceeding 700 MeV/c). The present
research is relevant to physical systems where high-density nuclear matter is
present. This condition covers a wide range of physics, from neutron stars to
nuclei stability and the repulsive nuclear core.
  The present work differs from previous studies in two crucial features. One
is the definition of the deuteron wave function, which include terms of a
relativistic origin that can be ordered based on their relative contribution to
the deuteron's internal momentum distribution. These terms, related to the
off-shell properties of the nucleon-nucleon bound-state, do not occur in
non-relativistic quantum mechanics. However, they become increasingly important
in describing configurations with a high nucleon-nucleon relative momentum. The
second difference is that we account for the off-shell nature of the bound
nucleon that enters on the definition of the (half-off-shell) electromagnetic
current. We avoid many of the difficulties inherent to the relativistic nature
of the processes involved by adopting a theoretical framework known as Light
Front dynamics. Simultaneous simplifications in the definition of the
relativistic wave function for the proton-neutron bound state and the treatment
of the (half-off-shell) electromagnetic current for the bound nucleon are among
the essential advantages resulting from the use of the Light Front dynamics.

network-connected systems. It allows a node to use part of memory in remote
nodes in the same cluster. Recent studies have improved RDMA-based memory
disaggregation systems, supporting lower latency and higher bandwidth than the
prior generation of disaggregated memory. However, the current disaggregated
memory systems manage remote memory only at coarse granularity due to the
limitation of the access validation mechanism of RDMA. In such systems, to
support fine-grained remote page allocation, the trustworthiness of all
participating systems needs to be assumed, and thus a security breach in a node
can propagate to the entire cluster. From the security perspective, the
memory-providing node must protect its memory from memory-requesting nodes. On
the other hand, the memory-requesting node requires the confidentiality and
integrity protection of its memory contents even if they are stored in remote
nodes. To address the weak isolation support in the current system, this study
proposes a novel hardware-assisted memory disaggregation system. Based on the
security features of FPGA, the logic in each per-node FPGA board provides a
secure memory disaggregation engine. With its own networks, a set of FPGA-based
engines form a trusted memory disaggregation system, which is isolated from the
privileged software of each participating node. The secure memory
disaggregation system allows fine-grained memory management in memory-providing
nodes, while the access validation is guaranteed with the hardware-hardened
mechanism. In addition, the proposed system hides the memory access patterns
observable from remote nodes, supporting obliviousness. Our evaluation with
FPGA implementation shows that such fine-grained secure disaggregated memory is
feasible with comparable performance to the latest software-based techniques.

reinforcement learning, and deep reinforcement learning. We then propose a
categorization of deep reinforcement learning methodologies and discuss their
advantages and limitations. In particular, we divide deep reinforcement
learning into seven main categories according to their applications in computer
vision, i.e. (i)landmark localization (ii) object detection; (iii) object
tracking; (iv) registration on both 2D image and 3D image volumetric data (v)
image segmentation; (vi) videos analysis; and (vii) other applications. Each of
these categories is further analyzed with reinforcement learning techniques,
network design, and performance. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive analysis
of the existing publicly available datasets and examine source code

polarization response of electromechanical systems to changes in an electric
field. We generalize that description to include a wide variety of responses to
changes in the electric field, as found in most systems and applications.
Electromechanical systems can be found in many physical and biological
applications, such as ion transport in membranes, batteries, and dielectric
elastomers. We present a unified, thermodynamically consistent, variational
framework for modeling electromechanical systems as they respond to changes in
the electric field; that is to say, as they polarize. This framework is
motivated and developed using the classical energetic variational approach
(EnVarA). The coupling between the electric part and the chemo-mechanical parts
of the system is described either by Lagrange multipliers or various energy
relaxations. The classical polarization and its dielectrics and dielectric
constants appear as outputs of this analysis. The Maxwell equations then become
universal conservation laws of charge and current, conjoined to an
electromechanical description of polarization. Polarization describes the
entire electromechanical response to changes in the electric field and can
sometimes be approximated as a dielectric constant or dielectric dispersion.

projecting, or marginalizing, over parameters like $h$, $\Omega_b$, $n_s$ and
$\Omega_\nu h^2$ that are both poorly constrained and correlated with the
parameters of interest like $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$ and $S_8$. Covering the
relevant parameter space we show that the projection biases are a function of
where the true values of the poorly constrained parameters lie with respect to
the parameter priors. For example, biases in the position of the posteriors can
exceed the 1.5$\sigma$ level if the true values of $h$ and $n_s$ are close to
the top of the prior's range and the true values of $\Omega_b$ and $\Omega_\nu

application of fin technology capitalizes on the anisotropic etch of Si(111)
relative to Si(110) to define atomically flat, high aspect ratio Si tunnel
barriers with epitaxial superconductor contacts on the parallel side-wall
surfaces. This process circumvents the challenges associated with the growth of
low-loss insulating barriers on lattice matched superconductors. By
implementing low-loss, intrinsic float-zone Si as the barrier material rather
than commonly used, potentially lossy AlOx, the FinMET is expected to overcome
problems with standard transmons by (1) reducing dielectric losses, (2)
minimizing the formation of two-level system spectral features, (3) exhibiting
greater control over barrier thickness and qubit frequency spread, especially
when combined with commercial fin fabrication and atomic-layer digital etching;
(4) potentially reducing the footprint by several orders of magnitude; and (5)
allowing scalable fabrication. Here, as a first step to making such a device,
the fabrication of Si fin capacitors on Si(110) substrates with
shadow-deposited Al electrodes is demonstrated. These fin capacitors are then
fabricated into lumped element resonator circuits and probed using
low-temperature microwave measurements. Further thinning of silicon junctions
towards the tunneling regime will enable the scalable fabrication of FinMET
devices based on existing silicon technology, while simultaneously avoiding
lossy amorphous dielectrics for the tunnel barriers.

and analyzing large time series datasets. The Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM)
is a type of unsupervised artificial neural network for visualizing and
clustering complex data, reducing the dimensionality of data, and selecting
influential features. Like all clustering methods, the SOM requires a measure
of similarity between input data (in this work time series). Dynamic time
warping (DTW) is one such measure, and a top performer given that it
accommodates the distortions when aligning time series. Despite its use in
clustering, DTW is limited in practice because it is quadratic in runtime
complexity with the length of the time series data. To address this, we present
a new DTW-based clustering method, called SOMTimeS (a Self-Organizing Map for
TIME Series), that scales better and runs faster than other DTW-based
clustering algorithms, and has similar performance accuracy. The computational
performance of SOMTimeS stems from its ability to prune unnecessary DTW
computations during the SOM's training phase. We also implemented a similar
pruning strategy for K-means for comparison with one of the top performing
clustering algorithms. We evaluated the pruning effectiveness, accuracy,
execution time and scalability on 112 benchmark time series datasets from the
University of California, Riverside classification archive. We showed that for
similar accuracy, the speed-up achieved for SOMTimeS and K-means was 1.8x on
average; however, rates varied between 1x and 18x depending on the dataset.
SOMTimeS and K-means pruned 43% and 50% of the total DTW computations,
respectively. We applied SOMtimeS to natural language conversation data
collected as part of a large healthcare cohort study of patient-clinician
serious illness conversations to demonstrate the algorithm's utility with

bi-continuous nanoporous (NP) metals as advanced electrodes in electrochemical
devices. The precise control of the uniform NP metal structures also provides
us a unique opportunity to understand how complex structures determine
transports at nanoscales. For NP Au from the dealloying of a Ag-Au alloy, we
can tune the pore size in the range of 13 nm to 2.4 microns and the porosity
between 38% and 69% via isothermal coarsening. For NP Ag from the
reduction-induced decomposition of AgCl, we can control additionally its
structural hierarchy and pore orientation. We measure the effective ionic
conductivities of 1 M NaClO4 through these NP metals as membranes, which range
from 7% to 44% of that of a free solution, corresponding to calculated pore
tortuosities between 2.7 and 1.3. The tortuosity of NP Au displays weak
dependences on both the pore size and the porosity, consistent with the
observed self-similarity in the coarsening, except for those of pores < 25 nm,
which we consider deviating from the well-coarsened pore geometry. For NP Ag,
the low tortuosity of the hierarchical structure can be explained with the
Maxwell-Garnett equation and that of the oriented structure underlines the
random orientation as the cause of slow transport in other NP metals. At last,
we achieve high current densities of CO2 reduction with these two
low-tortuosity NP Ags, demonstrating the significance of the
structure-transport relationships for designing functional NP metals.

of approximation-degree between two numerical values, proposes the concepts of
""strict approximation"" and ""strict approximation region"", then, derives the
corresponding one-dimensional interpolation methods and formulas, and then
presents a calculation model called ""sum-times-difference formula"" for
high-dimensional interpolation, thus develops a new interpolation approach,
that is, ADB interpolation. ADB interpolation is applied to the interpolation
of actual functions with satisfactory results. Viewed from principle and
effect, the interpolation approach is of novel idea, and has the advantages of
simple calculation, stable accuracy, facilitating parallel processing, very
suiting for high-dimensional interpolation, and easy to be extended to the
interpolation of vector valued functions. Applying the approach to
instance-based learning, a new instance-based learning method, learning using
ADB interpolation, is obtained. The learning method is of unique technique,
which has also the advantages of definite mathematical basis, implicit distance
weights, avoiding misclassification, high efficiency, and wide range of
applications, as well as being interpretable, etc. In principle, this method is
a kind of learning by analogy, which and the deep learning that belongs to
inductive learning can complement each other, and for some problems, the two
can even have an effect of ""different approaches but equal results"" in big data
and cloud computing environment. Thus, the learning using ADB interpolation can
also be regarded as a kind of ""wide learning"" that is dual to deep learning.

important process in several different semi-analytic (SA) galaxy formation
models (GALFORM, L-GALAXIES and MORGANA) through comparisons with a
hydrodynamical simulation performed with the moving-mesh code AREPO. Both SA
models and the simulation were run without any feedback or metal enrichment, in
order to focus on the cooling and accretion process. All of the SA models
considered here assume that gas cools from a spherical halo. We found that the
assumption that the gas conserves its angular momentum when moving from the
virial radius, $r_{\rm vir}$, to the central region of the halo, $r\sim 0.1
r_{\rm vir}$, is approximately consistent with the results from our simulation,
in which gas typically retains $70-80\%$ of its angular momentum during this
process. We also found that, compared to the simulation, the MORGANA model
tends to overestimate the mean specific angular momentum of cooled-down gas,
the L-GALAXIES model also tends to overestimate this in low-redshift massive
haloes, while the two older GALFORM models tend to underestimate the angular
momentum. In general, the predictions of the new GALFORM cooling model
developed by Hou et al. agree the best with the simulation.

investigated under the octupole-level approximation by taking non-perturbative
approaches. In practice, webs of the major secular resonances are produced by
identifying families of stable periodic orbits and the associated stable
libration zones are obtained by analysing Poincar\'e surfaces of section. By
taking different values of the factor $\epsilon$ ($\epsilon$ measures the
contribution of octupole terms), the influences of the octupole-order terms
upon the dynamical structures are evaluated. Under the condition of $\epsilon =
0$ (no octupole-order contribution), the dynamical model is totally integrable
and there is only Kozai resonance arising in the phase space. When the factor
$\epsilon$ is different from zero, the dynamical structure in the phase space
becomes complicated due to varieties of secular resonances appearing. Numerical
results further indicate that (a) distributions of libration centres and stable
libration zones remain qualitatively similar with different values of
$\epsilon$, (b) Kozai resonance disappears due to the chaotic motion in the
low-eccentricity region, and (c) the chaotic area arising in the
low-eccentricity region increases with the factor $\epsilon$. Secular
resonances are the source of many important dynamical phenomena, such as chaos,
orbit alignment and orbit flipping, and thus the results presented in this work
could be useful to understand the secular dynamics for those high-eccentricity
and/or high-inclination objects in hierarchical planetary systems.

(0.6--1 $\times$ 10$^8$ years), the abundance and isotope composition of
Martian atmospheric Ne reflect recent atmospheric gas supply mostly from
volcanic degassing. Thus, it can serve as a probe for the volatile content of
the interior. Here we show that the tentatively-informed atmospheric Ne

than Earth's mantle today by more than a factor of 5--80. The estimated mantle
Ne abundance requires efficient solar nebular gas capture or accretion of
Ne-rich materials such as solar-wind-implanted dust in the planet formation
stage, both of which provide important constraints on the abundance of other
volatile elements in the interior and the accretion history of Mars. More
precise determination of atmospheric Ne abundance and isotopic composition by

prediction head to detect different-scale objects. Then we replace the original
prediction heads with Transformer Prediction Heads (TPH) to explore the
prediction potential with self-attention mechanism. We also integrate
convolutional block attention model (CBAM) to find attention region on
scenarios with dense objects. To achieve more improvement of our proposed
TPH-YOLOv5, we provide bags of useful strategies such as data augmentation,
multiscale testing, multi-model integration and utilizing extra classifier.

vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) networks. To realize ISAC, an effective
beamforming design is essential which however, highly depends on the
availability of accurate channel tracking requiring large training overhead and
computational complexity. Motivated by this, we adopt a deep learning (DL)
approach to implicitly learn the features of historical channels and directly
predict the beamforming matrix to be adopted for the next time slot to maximize
the average achievable sum-rate of an ISAC system. The proposed method can
bypass the need of explicit channel tracking process and reduce the signaling
overhead significantly. To this end, a general sum-rate maximization problem
with Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs)-based sensing constraints is first
formulated for the considered ISAC system taking into account the multiple
access interference. Then, by exploiting the penalty method, a versatile
unsupervised DL-based predictive beamforming design framework is developed to
address the formulated design problem. As a realization of the developed
framework, a historical channels-based convolutional long short-term memory
(LSTM) network (HCL-Net) is devised for predictive beamforming in the
ISAC-based V2I network. Specifically, the convolution and LSTM modules are
successively adopted in the proposed HCL-Net to exploit the spatial and
temporal dependencies of communication channels to further improve the learning
performance. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed predictive
method not only guarantees the required sensing performance, but also achieves
a satisfactory sum-rate that can approach the upper bound obtained by the
genie-aided scheme with the perfect instantaneous channel state information

for describing the resonant dynamics of minor bodies with arbitrary
inclinations and semimajor axis ratios. In practice, the disturbing function is
expanded around circular orbits in the first step and then, in the second step,
the resulting mutual interaction between circular orbits is expanded around a
reference point. As usual, the resulting expansion is presented in the Fourier
series form, where the force amplitudes are dependent on the semimajor axis,
eccentricity and inclination and the harmonic arguments are linear combinations
of the mean longitude, longitude of pericenter and longitude of ascending node
of each mass. The resulting new expansion is valid for arbitrary inclinations
and semimajor axis ratios. In the case of mean motion resonant configuration,
the disturbing function can be easily averaged to produce the analytical
expansion of resonant disturbing function. Based on the analytical expansion,
the Hamiltonian model of mean motion resonances is formulated, and the
resulting analytical developments are applied to Jupiter's inner and co-orbital
resonances and Neptune's exterior resonances. Analytical expansion is validated
by comparing the analytical results with the associated numerical outcomes.

tasks require different capabilities of the agent and entail various model

every sequence of $M$ updates (no need to know $M$'s value in advance), our
algorithm, $DynELM$, achieves $O(\log^2 |V| + \log |V| \cdot \log

respectively, are investigated here. A finite-element thermal analysis is
carried out to study the parametric effects on the thermal management of the
terahertz QCL. The modeling reveals that the symmetric thermal dissipation
(type B) results in a more uniform thermal conduction and lower maximum
temperature in the active region of the laser, compared to the traditional
asymmetric thermal dissipation scheme (type A). To verify the simulation,
experiments are further performed by measuring laser performance and comb
characteristics of terahertz QCLs emitting around 4.2 THz mounted on type A and
type B cold fingers. The experimental results show that the symmetric thermal
dissipation approach (type B) is effective for improving the comb and dual-comb
operation of terahertz QCLs, which can be further widely adopted for

for the charging of electrical double layers inside a cylindrical pore for
arbitrary pore size. We assume small applied potentials and perform a regular
perturbation analysis to predict the evolution of electrical potential and ion
concentrations in both the radial and axial directions. We validate our
perturbation model with direct numerical simulations of the
Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations, and obtain quantitative agreement between the
two approaches for small and moderate potentials. Our analysis yields two main
characteristic features of arbitrary pore size: i) a monotonic decrease of the
charging timescale with an increase in relative pore size (pore size relative
to Debye length); ii) large potential changes for overlapping double layers in
a thin transition region, which we approximate mathematically by a jump
discontinuity. We quantify the contributions of electromigration and charge
diffusion fluxes which provide mechanistic insights into the dependence of
charging timescale and capacitance on pore size. We develop a modified
transmission circuit model that captures the effect of arbitrary pore size and
demonstrate that a time-dependent transition-region resistor needs to be

average effective capacitance and charging timescale as a function of pore-size

smaller average pore sizes and with smaller polydispersity, resulting in a gain
of energy density at a constant power density. Overall, our results advance the

light-matter coupling including the control of chemical reactions by altering
the vibrational normal modes of molecules. In the vibrational strong coupling
regime the normal modes of the system become hybrid modes which mix nuclear,
electronic, and photonic degrees of freedom. First principles methods capable
of treating light and matter degrees of freedom on the same level of theory are
an important tool in understanding such systems. In this work, we develop and
apply a generalized force constant matrix approach to the study of mixed
vibration-photon (vibro-polariton) states of molecules based on the cavity
Born-Oppenheimer approximation and quantum-electrodynamical density-functional
theory. With this method vibro-polariton modes and infrared spectra can be
computed via linear response techniques analogous to those widely used for
conventional vibrations and phonons. We also develop an accurate model that
highlights the consistent treatment of cavity coupled electrons in the
vibrational strong coupling regime. These electronic effects appear as new
terms previously disregarded by simpler models. This effective model also
allows for an accurate extrapolation of single and two molecule calculations to
the collective strong coupling limit of hundreds of molecules. We benchmark
these approaches for single and many CO$_2$ molecules coupled to a single
photon mode and the iron-pentacarbonyl Fe(CO)$_5$ molecule coupled to a few
photon modes. Our results are the first ab-initio results for collective
vibrational strong coupling effects. This framework for efficient computations
of vibro-polaritons paves the way to a systematic description and improved
understanding of the behavior of chemical systems in vibrational strong

ratio is a good proxy of the subhalo formation time, and increases with the
subhalo formation redshifts, especially for massive galaxies. The subhalo
formation time is dependent on the cosmic web environment. For central
subhaloes, there is a characteristic subhalo mass of $\sim 10^{12} \msun$,
below which subhaloes in knots are older than subhaloes of the same mass in
filaments, sheets, or voids, while above which it reverses. The cosmic web
environmental dependence of stellar-to-subhalo mass ratio is similar to that of

heterogeneous nonlinear advection and heterogeneous diffusion. We demonstrate
many remarkable benefits from the moving patch scheme, including efficient and

Equation-free methods are here extended to simulate moving, forming and merging
shocks without a priori knowledge of the existence or closure of the shocks.
Whereas adaptive moving mesh equations are typically stiff, typically requiring
small time-steps on the macro-scale, the moving macro-scale mesh of patches is
typically not stiff given the context of the micro-scale time-steps required

improving generalisation for tail classes. Most existing works use supervised
learning without considering the prevailing noise in the training dataset. To
move long-tailed learning towards more realistic scenarios, this work
investigates the label noise problem under long-tailed label distribution. We
first observe the negative impact of noisy labels on the performance of
existing methods, revealing the intrinsic challenges of this problem. As the
most commonly used approach to cope with noisy labels in previous literature,
we then find that the small-loss trick fails under long-tailed label
distribution. The reason is that deep neural networks cannot distinguish
correctly-labeled and mislabeled examples on tail classes. To overcome this
limitation, we establish a new prototypical noise detection method by designing
a distance-based metric that is resistant to label noise. Based on the above
findings, we propose a robust framework,~\algo, that realizes noise detection
for long-tailed learning, followed by soft pseudo-labeling via both label
smoothing and diverse label guessing. Moreover, our framework can naturally
leverage semi-supervised learning algorithms to further improve the
generalisation. Extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our methods over existing baselines. In

each pixel is measured via on-chip electronic readout circuit followed by
analog to digital (A/D) conversion, image processing, and presentation of the
final IR image on a separate information display screen. In this work, we
introduce a new nanophotonic detector as a minimalist alternative to
microbolometer such that the final IR image can be presented without using the
components required for A/D conversion, image processing and display. In our
design, the detector array is illuminated with visible laser light and the
reflected light itself carries the IR image which can be directly viewed. We
realize and numerically demonstrate this functionality using a resonant
waveguide grating structure made of typical materials such as silicon carbide,
silicon nitride, and silica for which lithography techniques are
well-developed. We clarify the requirements to tackle the issues of fabrication
nonuniformities and temperature drifts in the detector array. We envision a
potential near-eye display device for IR vision based on timely use of
diffractive optical waveguides in augmented reality headsets and tunable
visible laser sources. Our work indicates a way to achieve direct thermal IR
vision for suitable use cases with lower cost, smaller form factor, and reduced
power consumption compared to the existing thermal IR cameras.

compression. Its predictive coding scheme propagates the quantization
distortion through the prediction chain and creates a temporal dependency.
Prior research typically models the distortion propagation based on the
similarity between original pixels under the assumption of high resolution
quantization. Its efficacy in the low to medium bit-rate range, where the
quantization step size is largely comparable to the magnitude of the residual
signals, is questionable. This work proposes a quantitative approach to
estimating the temporal dependency. It evaluates the rate and distortion for
each coding block using the original and the reconstructed motion compensation
reference blocks, respectively. Their difference effectively measures how the
quantization error in the reference block impacts the coding efficiency of the
current block. A recursive update process is formulated to track such
dependency through a group of pictures. The proposed scheme quantifies the
temporal dependency more accurately across a wide range of operating bit-rates,
which translates into considerable coding performance gains over the existing
contenders as demonstrated in the experiments.

Electrogastrogram (EGG), Electrocardiogram (ECG), Respiration Rate, Heart Rate,
and Oxygen Saturation (SpO2). Based on these parameters, the resting position
is classified using a hybrid stacked ensemble machine learning model designed
using the Decision tree, Random Forest, and Xgboost algorithms. Our study
demonstrates a 100% accurate prediction of the resting position using the
hybrid model. The proposed method of identifying the resting position based on
physiological parameters has the potential to be integrated into wearable
devices. This is a low cost, highly accurate and autonomous technique to
monitor the body posture while maintaining the user privacy by eliminating the

spectrum near the upper threshold in the context of the two-channel uniformized
Mittag-Leffler expansion, an expression written as a sum of pole terms under an
appropriate variable where the S-matrix is made single-valued (uniformization).
We show that the transition of the spectrum is continuous as a S-matrix pole
moves across the boundaries of the complex energy Riemann sheets and that the
physical spectrum peaks at or near the upper threshold when the S-matrix pole
is positioned sufficiently close to it on the uniformized plane. There is no
essential difference on which sheet the pole is positioned. What is important
is the existence of a pole near the upper threshold and the distance between
the pole and the physical region, not on which complex energy sheet the pole is
positioned. We also point out that when the pole is close to the upper
threshold, the complex pole does not have the usual meaning of the resonance.
Neither the real part represents the peak energy, nor the imaginary part
represents the half width. Subsequently, we try to understand the current
status of $Z(3900)$ from the viewpoint of the uniformized Mittag-Leffler
expansion reflecting in particular, Phys.Rev.Lett.117, 242001 (2016) in which
they concluded that $Z(3900)$ is not a conventional resonance but a threshold
cusp. We point out that their results turn out to indicate the existence of
S-matrix poles near the $\bar D D^*$ threshold, which is most likely the origin
of the peak found in their calculation of the near-threshold spectrum. In order
to support our argument, we set up a separable potential model which shares
common behavior of poles near the $\bar D D^*$ threshold to the above-mentioned
reference and show in our model that the structures near the $\bar D D^*$
threshold are indeed caused by these near-threshold poles.

This entails problems in the perception of the world, but also faulty behavior,
based on errors in the system. Apart from that, non-expert users frequently
have incorrect assumptions about the functionality and limitations of a robotic
system. This leads to incompatibilities between the user's behavior and the
functioning of the robot's system, causing problems on the robot's side and in

To address these challenges, we develop a new Unsupervised Dense Deformation
Embedding Network (i.e., UD^2E-Net), which learns to predict deformations
between non-rigid shapes from dense local features. Since it is non-trivial to
match deformation-variant local features for deformation prediction, we develop
an Extrinsic-Intrinsic Autoencoder to frst encode extrinsic geometric features
from source into intrinsic coordinates in a shared canonical shape, with which
the decoder then synthesizes corresponding target features. Moreover, a bounded
maximum mean discrepancy loss is developed to mitigate the distribution
divergence between the synthesized and original features. To learn natural
deformation without dense supervision, we introduce a coarse parameterized
deformation graph, for which a novel trace and propagation algorithm is
proposed to improve both the quality and effciency of the deformation. Our

employment for Circular Economy (CE) in SMEs in the European Union and
investigates the role of green jobs and skills for the implementation of CE
practices. Design/methodology/approach: The data are collected in a
Eurobarometer survey, and refer to resource efficiency, green markets, and CE
practices. Lack of environmental expertise is one of the factors that might be
perceived as an obstacle when trying to implement resource efficiency actions.
Previous research shows that, although resource efficiency practices are
adopted by firms in all European countries, there are differences both within
and between countries. The analysis of the determinants of green behavior by
European SMEs is completed by a study of heterogeneity across firms and within
countries with a multilevel latent class model, a hierarchical clustering
method. Findings: A general important evidence is that having no workers
dedicated to green jobs is strongly correlated to the probability of adopting
resource efficiency practices, while perceiving the need of extra environmental
skills has a positive effect on the intention to implement actions in the
future. Other characteristics of the firms play a significant impact on
resource efficiency: in general, older and bigger firms, with larger yearly
turnover, are more prone to implement actions. The type of chosen action varies
across activity sectors. What is original/value of paper: In the reference
literature, the relationship between green jobs, environmental skills, workers
employed in CE practices, and resource efficiency has received limited
attention so far.

we are able to recover the case $q\in (1,\infty)$ in the infinite-dimensional

from standard compactness arguments): our proof in such setting is much
simpler, relying on Gaussian integration-by-parts formulas and an adaptation of
Sobolev inequalities in Euclidean spaces, and it provides again quantitative
bounds on the multiplying constants, which however blow up when the dimension
diverges to $\infty$ (whence the need for a different approach in the

various fluxes (e.g., heat flux) triggered by different forces, electromagnetic
fields, and gradients in density or temperature. In the outer corona and at
relatively low heliocentric distances in the solar wind (i.e., < 1 AU),
particle-particle collisions play an important role in the transport of energy,
momentum, and matter, described within classical transport theory by the
transport coefficients, which relate the fluxes to their sources. The present
paper aims to improve the evaluation of the main transport coefficients in such
nonequilibrium plasmas, on the basis of an implicit realistic characterization
of their particle velocity distributions, in accord with the in situ
observations. Of particular interest is the presence of suprathermal
populations and their influence on these transport coefficients. Using the
Boltzmann transport equation and macroscopic laws for the energy and particle
fluxes, we derived electric conductivity, thermoelectric coefficient, thermal
conductivity, diffusion, and mobility coefficient. These are conditioned by the
electrons, which are empirically well described by the Kappa distribution, with
a nearly Maxwellian core and power-law tails enhanced by the suprathermal
population. Here we have adopted the original Kappa approach that has the
ability to outline and quantify the contribution of suprathermal populations.
Without exception, the transport coefficients are found to be systematically
and markedly enhanced in the presence of suprathermal electrons, due to the
additional kinetic energy with which these populations contribute to the
dynamics of space plasma systems. The present results also show how important
an adequate Kappa modeling of suprathermal populations is, which is in contrast
to other modified interpretations that underestimate the effects of these

VRC is a challenging task, even more so than the well-studied object

goal of the optimization framework is to find the optimal solution by learning
visual relationship similarity across images in a few-shot setting. To obtain
robust visual relationship representation, we utilize a simple yet effective
technique that learns relationship embedding as a translation vector from

coherent quasi-particle magnon polarons. Here, we report the direct observation
of a series of terahertz magnon polarons in a layered zigzag antiferromagnet

avoided-crossing behavior is clearly seen as the magnon-phonon detuning is
continuously changed via Zeeman shift of the magnon mode. The coupling strength
g is giant, achieving 120 GHz (0.5 meV), the largest value reported so far.
Such a strong coupling leads to a large ratio of g to the resonance frequency

first-principle calculations, where the strong coupling is identified to arise

proved that the typical sectional curvatures are always positive if the metric
is an arbitrary function of operator size. While complexity geometry is usually
expected to be defined on negatively curved manifolds. By analyzing the
sectional curvatures distribution for $N$-qubit system, it is shown that
surfaces generated by Hamiltonians of size smaller than the typical size can
have negative curvatures. In the large $N$ limit, the form of complexity metric
is uniquely constrained up to constant corrections if we require sectional

generalized to be state-dependent. Then we use this state-dependent operator

  Proportional-Integral Lagrangian",,,,,"cs.LG cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Safety is essential for reinforcement learning (RL) applied in the real
world. Adding chance constraints (or probabilistic constraints) is a suitable
way to enhance RL safety under uncertainty. Existing chance-constrained RL
methods like the penalty methods and the Lagrangian methods either exhibit
periodic oscillations or learn an over-conservative or unsafe policy. In this
paper, we address these shortcomings by proposing a separated
proportional-integral Lagrangian (SPIL) algorithm. We first review the
constrained policy optimization process from a feedback control perspective,
which regards the penalty weight as the control input and the safe probability
as the control output. Based on this, the penalty method is formulated as a
proportional controller, and the Lagrangian method is formulated as an integral
controller. We then unify them and present a proportional-integral Lagrangian
method to get both their merits, with an integral separation technique to limit
the integral value in a reasonable range. To accelerate training, the gradient
of safe probability is computed in a model-based manner. We demonstrate our
method can reduce the oscillations and conservatism of RL policy in a
car-following simulation. To prove its practicality, we also apply our method
to a real-world mobile robot navigation task, where our robot successfully
avoids a moving obstacle with highly uncertain or even aggressive behaviors.

emotion recognition in conversation is inaccurate if the previous utterances

improve the performances. Many recent approaches show performance improvement
by combining knowledge into modules learned from external structured data.
However, structured data is difficult to access in non-English languages,
making it difficult to extend to other languages. Therefore, we extract the
pre-trained memory using the pre-trained language model as an extractor of
external knowledge. We introduce CoMPM, which combines the speaker's
pre-trained memory with the context model, and find that the pre-trained memory
significantly improves the performance of the context model. CoMPM achieves the
first or second performance on all data and is state-of-the-art among systems
that do not leverage structured data. In addition, our method shows that it can
be extended to other languages because structured knowledge is not required,

disparate accent-aware modules to perform accent-aware modulation of acoustic
features in a finer-grained manner, so as to enhance the discriminating

sketch abstraction modeling for generation tasks. Our lattice representation

sensitive to elongation, to find filamentary regions in H$\alpha$, [SII], and
[OIII] images of the Magellanic Cloud Emission Line Survey (MCELS). Using the
phase of $\psi_2$, we were able to draw lines perpendicular to each filament

bubble-like structure and to detect structures at different window sizes. The
detected bubbles in all bands are spatially correlated to the distribution of
massive stars, showing that we indeed detect interstellar bubbles without large
spatial bias. Eighteen out of 59 supernova remnants in the Large Magellanic

disturbs the detection, a too small size, or the lack of a (circular)
counterpart in our emission line images. In line-density maps at larger scales,
maxima can be found in regions with high star formation in the past, often

shell where a collision of large gas clouds is thought to have occurred. In the
Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), bubble detection is impaired by the more complex

expanding Kasner metrics. Using the application of vector identities we derive
2$^\textrm{nd}$-order differential wave equations for the electromagnetic field
components; through this explicit derivation, we find that the
2$^\textrm{nd}$-order wave equations are not uncoupled for the various
components (as previously assumed), but that gravitationally-induced coupling
between the electric and magnetic field components is generated directly by the
anisotropy of the expansion. The lack of such coupling terms in the wave
equations from several prior studies may indicate a generally incomplete
understanding of the evolution of electromagnetic energy in anisotropic
cosmologies. Uncoupling the field components requires the derivation of a
4$^\textrm{th}$-order wave equation, which we obtain for Kasner-like metrics
with generalized expansion/contraction rate indices. For the axisymmetric
Kasner case, $(p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}) = (1,0,0)$, we obtain exact field solutions
(for general propagation wavevectors), half of which appear not to have been
found before in previous studies. For the other axisymmetric Kasner case,
$\{p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}\} = \{(-1/3),(2/3),(2/3)\}$, we use numerical methods to
demonstrate the explicit violation of the geometric optics approximation at

towards the initial singularity, with $v \rightarrow 0$ as $t \rightarrow 0$.

greenhouses provide an ideal solution to meet the increasing demand for fresh
food. However, managers are faced with some challenges in finding appropriate
control strategies for crop growth, since the decision space of the greenhouse
control problem is an astronomical number. Therefore, an intelligent
closed-loop control framework is highly desired to generate an automatic
control policy. As a powerful tool for optimal control, reinforcement learning
(RL) algorithms can surpass human beings' decision-making and can also be
seamlessly integrated into the closed-loop control framework. However, in
complex real-world scenarios such as agricultural automation control, where the
interaction with the environment is time-consuming and expensive, the
application of RL algorithms encounters two main challenges, i.e., sample
efficiency and safety. Although model-based RL methods can greatly mitigate the
efficiency problem of greenhouse control, the safety problem has not got too
much attention. In this paper, we present a model-based robust RL framework for
autonomous greenhouse control to meet the sample efficiency and safety
challenges. Specifically, our framework introduces an ensemble of environment
models to work as a simulator and assist in policy optimization, thereby
addressing the low sample efficiency problem. As for the safety concern, we
propose a sample dropout module to focus more on worst-case samples, which can
help improve the adaptability of the greenhouse planting policy in extreme
cases. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can learn a more
effective greenhouse planting policy with better robustness than existing
methods.

many forms. Ordinary DFT (ODFT) and symmetric DFT (SDFT) are the two main forms
of DFT. The most widely used DFT is ODFT, and the phase spectrum of this form
is widely used in engineering applications. However, it is found ODFT has the
problem of phase aliasing. Moreover, ODFT does not have many FT properties,
such as symmetry, integration, and interpolation. When compared with ODFT, SDFT
has more FT properties. Theoretically, the more properties a transformation
has, the wider its application range. Hence, SDFT is more suitable as the
discrete form of FT. In order to promote SDFT, the unique nature of SDFT is
demonstrated. The time-domain of even-point SDFT is not symmetric to zero, and
the author corrects it in this study. The author raises a new issue that should
the signal length be odd or even when performing SDFT. The answer is odd.
However, scientists and engineers are accustomed to using even-numbered
sequences. At the end of this study, the reasons why the author advocates odd
SDFT are given. Besides, even sampling function, discrete frequency Fourier

has been an essential step in bringing about a more faithful depiction of the
dynamics of real-world systems. Despite the multi-dimensional nature of the
oscillators in these generalized models, the interacting schemes so far have
been dominated by a scalar factor unanimously between any pair of oscillators
that leads eventually to synchronization on all dimensions. As a natural
extension of the scalar coupling befitting for the one-dimensional case, we
take a tentative step in studying numerically and theoretically the coupling
mechanism of $2\times2$ real matrices on two-dimensional Kuramoto oscillators.
One of the features stemmed from this new mechanism is that the matrix coupling
enables the two dimensions of the oscillators to separate their transitions to
either synchronization or desynchronization which has not been seen in other
high-dimensional generalizations. Under various matrix configurations, the
synchronization and desynchronization of the two dimensions combine into four
qualitatively distinct modes of position and motion of the system. We
demonstrate that as one matrix is morphed into another in a specific manner,
the system mode also switches correspondingly either through continuous or
explosive transitions of the order parameters, thus mimicking a range of
behaviors in information science and biology.

density-temperature regime at the boundary between moderate and strong
degeneracy is in fact crucial for modelling the helium cores of red giant
branch stars and the hydrogen/helium envelopes of white dwarfs. Prompted by
recently published new, improved calculations of electron thermal
conductivities and opacities for moderate degeneracy, we study different,
physically motivated prescriptions to bridge these new computations with well
established results in the regime of strong degeneracy. We find that these
different prescriptions have a sizable impact on the predicted He-core masses
at the He-flash (up to 0.01$M_{\odot}$ for initial total masses far from the
transition to non-degenerate He-cores, and up to $\sim 0.04M_{\odot}$ for
masses around the transition), the tip of the red giant branch (up to
$\sim$0.1~mag) and the zero age horizontal branch luminosities (up to 0.03~dex
for masses far from the transition, and up to $\sim$0.2~dex around the
transition), and white dwarf cooling times (up to 40-45\% at high luminosities,
and up to $\sim$25\% at low luminosities). Current empirical constraints on the
tip of the red giant branch and the zero age horizontal branch absolute
magnitudes do not allow yet to definitely exclude any of these alternative
options for the conductive opacities. Tests against observations of
slowly-cooling faint WDs in old stellar populations will need to be performed
to see whether they can set some more stringent constraints on how to bridge

state-of-the-art models showing less than 80% macro-F1 score on benchmark
datasets. Existing models do not incorporate information on aspect-aspect
relations in knowledge graphs (KGs), e.g. DBpedia. Two main challenges stem
from inaccurate disambiguation of aspects to KG entities, and the inability to
learn aspect representations from the large KGs in joint training with ALSC
models. We propose AR-BERT, a novel two-level global-local entity embedding
scheme that allows efficient joint training of KG-based aspect embeddings and
ALSC models. A novel incorrect disambiguation detection technique addresses the
problem of inaccuracy in aspect disambiguation. We also introduce the problem
of determining mode significance in multi-modal explanation generation, and
propose a two step solution. The proposed methods show a consistent improvement
of 2.5 - 4.1 percentage points, over the recent BERT-based baselines on
benchmark datasets. The code is available at

with Scalar Hair (KBHsSH) of special interest for Gravitational Wave (GW)
events originated from Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs). Because of the
off-center distribution of energy density, these spacetimes are warped in such
a way that not all metric functions behave monotonically on the equatorial
plane as in the exterior region of Kerr black holes (KBHs). This has great
impact on the orbital parameters, which in turn affects the imprints on signals
descendant from EMRIs in a adiabatic evolution. By investigating circular obit
parameters, we unveil what qualitative features could be present in the signals
that are new and distinct compared to KBHs, and we evolve some inspirals by
employing the usual quadrupole formula approximation. We show that the
frequencies of the emitted signals behave nonmonotonically, i.e. they can
backward chirp, and for some particular cases they can become arbitrarily
small, falling below LISA's sensibility range. Finally, we present two sets of
waveforms produced by a noncircular EMRI in which the compact object (CO)
follows a type of geodesic motion typically present in spacetimes with a static
ring (SR), in which the compact object is periodically momentarily at rest.

very high ionic strength (I). When the building blocks are mixed at large ionic
strength (1M NH4Cl), the electrostatic interaction is screened and complexation
does not occur. If the ionic strength is then lowered down to a targeted ionic
strength Itarget, there is a critical threshold Ic = 0.62 M at which
complexation occurs, that is independent on the charge ratio Z and the pathway
used to reduce salinity (drop-by-drop mixing or fast mixing). If salt is added
back up to 1M, the transition is not reversible and persistent
out-of-equilibrium aggregates are formed. The lifetimes of such aggregates
depends on Itarget: the closer Itarget to Ic is, the more difficult it is to
dissolve the aggregates. Such peculiar behavior is driven by the inner
structure of the complexes that are formed after desalting. When Itarget is far
below Ic, strong electrostatic interactions induce the formation of dense,
compact and frozen aggregates. Such aggregates can only poorly reorganize
further on with time, which makes their dissolution upon resalting almost
reversible. Conversely, when Itarget is close to Ic more open aggregates are
formed due to weaker electrostatic interactions upon desalting. System can thus
rearrange with time to lower its free energy and reach more stable
out-of-equilibrium states which are very difficult to dissociate back upon
resalting, even at very high ionic strength.

at repetition rates exceeding 100 kHz, showing a continuum in the cut-off

photons per pulse was insufficient to perform pulse characterisation via
attosecond streaking, let alone to perform a pump-probe experiment. Here we
report on the generation and full characterisation of XUV attosecond pulses via
HHG driven by near-single-cycle pulses at a repetition rate of 100 kHz. The
high number of 10^6 XUV photons per pulse on target enables attosecond electron
streaking experiments through which the XUV pulses are determined to consist of
a dominant single attosecond pulse. These results open the door for attosecond

the \textit{Pulsar Timing Array} experiments, our model predicts an amplitude

primarily from equal mass binaries with chirp masses above $\rm 10^{8}\,

stochastic GWB coming from MBHBs. By boosting the massive black hole growth via
gas accretion, we show that our model can produce a signal with an amplitude

clustering. Firstly, a FNN is constructed to decompose and learn the
information of each amplitude modulation frequency component and non-periodic
component in the raw data. Secondly, the frequency components obtained by the
FNN are clustered into multiple Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF) with separated
spectrum based on the energy of each frequency component learned by FNN.
Practical decomposition results on a series of artificial and real data show
that NMD algorithm can effectively implement mode decomposition, better reflect
the characteristics of raw data than EMD, and has higher adaptability than
Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD).

$M_{\odot}$ suffer an episode of surface lithium enrichment between the tip of

can be confirmed in a sample of RC and RGB stars that are members of open
clusters. We discuss Li abundances in six open clusters with ages between 1.5
and 4.9 Gyr (turn-off masses between 1.1 and 1.7 $M_{\odot}$). These
observations are compared with the predictions of different models that include
rotation-induced mixing, thermohaline instability, mixing induced by the first
He flash, and energy losses by neutrino magnetic moment. In six clusters, we
find about 35\% RC stars with Li abundances that are similar or higher than
those of upper RGB stars. This can be a sign of fresh Li production. Because of
the extra-mixing episode connected to the luminosity bump, the expectation was
for RC stars to have systematically lower surface Li abundances. However, we
cannot confirm that the possible Li production is ubiquitous. For about 65\% RC
giants we can only determine abundance upper limits that could be hiding very
low Li abundances. Our results indicate a possible production of Li during the
RC, at levels that would not classify the stars as Li rich. Determination of
their carbon isotopic ratio would help to confirm that the RC giants have
suffered extra mixing followed by Li enrichment. The Li abundances of the RC
stars can be qualitatively explained by the models with an additional mixing
episode close to the He flash.

turbulence that the cosmic rays drive upstream of the shock. We explore the
rate of energy transfer from cosmic rays to non-resonant Bell modes and the
spectral softening it implies. Accounting for the finite time available for
turbulence driving at supernova-remnant shocks yields a smaller spectral impact
than found earlier with steady-state considerations. Generally, for diffusion
scaling with the Bohm rate by a factor $\eta$, the change in spectral index is
at most $\eta$ divided by the Alfv\'enic Mach number of the thermal sub-shock.
For $M_\mathrm{A}\lesssim 50$ it is well below this limit. Only for very fast
shocks and very efficient cosmic-ray acceleration the change in spectral index
may reach $0.1$. For standard SNR parameters it is negligible. Independent
confirmation is derived by considering the synchrotron energy losses of
electrons: if intense nonthermal multi-keV emission is produced, the energy
loss, and hence the spectral steepening, is very small for hadronic cosmic rays
that produce TeV-band gamma-ray emission.

hampered due to the lack of abundant pixel-level annotated data. Few-shot
Semantic Segmentation (FSS) is a promising strategy for breaking the deadlock.
However, a high-performing FSS model still requires sufficient pixel-level
annotated classes for training to avoid overfitting, which leads to its
performance bottleneck in medical image segmentation due to the unmet need for
annotations. Thus, semi-supervised FSS for medical images is accordingly
proposed to utilize unlabeled data for further performance improvement.
Nevertheless, existing semi-supervised FSS methods has two obvious defects: (1)
neglecting the relationship between the labeled and unlabeled data; (2) using
unlabeled data directly for end-to-end training leads to degenerated
representation learning. To address these problems, we propose a novel
semi-supervised FSS framework for medical image segmentation. The proposed
framework employs Poisson learning for modeling data relationship and
propagating supervision signals, and Spatial Consistency Calibration for
encouraging the model to learn more coherent representations. In this process,
unlabeled samples do not involve in end-to-end training, but provide
supervisory information for query image segmentation through graph-based
learning. We conduct extensive experiments on three medical image segmentation
datasets (i.e. ISIC skin lesion segmentation, abdominal organs segmentation for
MRI and abdominal organs segmentation for CT) to demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance and broad applicability of the proposed framework.

Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) images. Accurate retinal vessel
segmentation is important for the diagnosis and prevention of ophthalmic
diseases. However, making full use of the 3D data of OCTA volumes is a vital
factor for obtaining satisfactory segmentation results. In this paper, we
propose a Progressive Attention-Enhanced Network (PAENet) based on attention
mechanisms to extract rich feature representation. Specifically, the framework
consists of two main parts, the three-dimensional feature learning path and the
two-dimensional segmentation path. In the three-dimensional feature learning
path, we design a novel Adaptive Pooling Module (APM) and propose a new
Quadruple Attention Module (QAM). The APM captures dependencies along the
projection direction of volumes and learns a series of pooling coefficients for
feature fusion, which efficiently reduces feature dimension. In addition, the
QAM reweights the features by capturing four-group cross-dimension
dependencies, which makes maximum use of 4D feature tensors. In the
two-dimensional segmentation path, to acquire more detailed information, we
propose a Feature Fusion Module (FFM) to inject 3D information into the 2D
path. Meanwhile, we adopt the Polarized Self-Attention (PSA) block to model the
semantic interdependencies in spatial and channel dimensions respectively.
Experimentally, our extensive experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset show that our
proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with previous
methods.

traffic. However, dynamic cell switching has the challenge of spectrum
under-utilizationas the spectrum originally occupied by the BSs that are turned
off remains dormant. This dormant spectrum can be leased by the primary network
(PN) operators, who hold the license, to the secondary network (SN) operators
who cannot afford to purchase the spectrum license. Thus enabling the PN to
gain additional revenue from spectrum leasing as well as from electricity cost
savings due to reduced energy consumption. Therefore, in this work, we propose
a cell switching and spectrum leasing framework based on simulated annealing
(SA) algorithm to maximize the revenue of the PN while respecting the
quality-of-service constraints. The performance evaluation reveals that the
proposed method is very close to optimal exhaustive search method with a
significant reduction in the computation complexity.

optimizers for nonconvex optimization have been widely studied. Meanwhile,
numerical evaluations for the optimizers have precisely clarified the
relationship between batch size and the number of steps needed for training
deep neural networks. The main contribution of this paper is to show
theoretically that the number of steps needed for nonconvex optimization of
each of the optimizers can be expressed as a rational function of batch size.
Having these rational functions leads to two particularly important facts,
which were validated numerically in previous studies. The first fact is that
there exists an optimal batch size such that the number of steps needed for
nonconvex optimization is minimized. This implies that using larger batch sizes
than the optimal batch size does not decrease the number of steps needed for
nonconvex optimization. The second fact is that the optimal batch size depends
on the optimizer. In particular, it is shown theoretically that momentum and
Adam-type optimizers can exploit larger optimal batches and further reduce the
minimum number of steps needed for nonconvex optimization than can the
stochastic gradient descent optimizer.

important tool in fundamental crowd dynamics research allowing to quantify
statistics of relevant observables including walking velocities, mutual
distances and body orientations. As this technology advances, it is becoming
increasingly useful also in society. In fact, continued urbanization is
overwhelming existing pedestrian infrastructures such as transportation hubs
and stations, generating an urgent need for real-time highly-accurate usage
data, aiming both at flow monitoring and dynamics understanding. To
successfully employ pedestrian tracking techniques in research and technology,
it is crucial to validate and benchmark them for accuracy. This is not only
necessary to guarantee data quality, but also to identify systematic errors.
  In this contribution, we present and discuss a benchmark suite, towards an
open standard in the community, for privacy-respectful pedestrian tracking
techniques. The suite is technology-independent and is applicable to academic
and commercial pedestrian tracking systems, operating both in lab environments
and real-life conditions. The benchmark suite consists of 5 tests addressing
specific aspects of pedestrian tracking quality, including accurate crowd flux
estimation, density estimation, position detection and trajectory accuracy. The
output of the tests are quality factors expressed as single numbers. We provide
the benchmark results for two tracking systems, both operating in real-life,
one commercial, and the other based on overhead depth-maps developed at TU
Eindhoven. We discuss the results on the basis of the quality factors and
report on the typical sensor and algorithmic performance. This enables us to
highlight the current state-of-the-art, its limitations and provide
installation recommendations, with specific attention to multi-sensor setups
and data stitching.

  Deep Auto-Encoder","Pages: 23, 8 Figures, 2 Tables",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automatic segmentation of shoulder muscle MRI is challenging due to the high
variation in muscle size, shape, texture, and spatial position of tears. Manual
segmentation of tear and muscle portion is hard, time-consuming, and subjective
to pathological expertise. This work proposes a new Region and Edge-based Deep
Auto-Encoder (RE-DAE) for shoulder muscle MRI segmentation. The proposed RE-DAE
harmoniously employs average and max-pooling operation in the encoder and
decoder blocks of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Region-based
segmentation incorporated in the Deep Auto-Encoder (DAE) encourages the network
to extract smooth and homogenous regions. In contrast, edge-based segmentation
tries to learn the boundary and anatomical information. These two concepts,
systematically combined in a DAE, generate a discriminative and sparse hybrid
feature space (exploiting both region homogeneity and boundaries). Moreover,
the concept of static attention is exploited in the proposed RE-DAE that helps
in effectively learning the tear region. The performances of the proposed MRI
segmentation based DAE architectures have been tested using a 3D MRI shoulder
muscle dataset using the hold-out cross-validation technique. The MRI data has
been collected from the Korea University Anam Hospital, Seoul, South Korea.
Experimental comparisons have been conducted by employing innovative
custom-made and existing pre-trained CNN architectures both using transfer
learning and fine-tuning. Objective evaluation on the muscle datasets using the
proposed SA-RE-DAE showed a dice similarity of 85.58% and 87.07%, an accuracy
of 81.57% and 95.58% for tear and muscle regions, respectively. The high visual
quality and the objective result suggest that the proposed SA-RE-DAE is able to
correctly segment tear and muscle regions in shoulder muscle MRI for better
clinical decisions.

availability of multiple source domains, this paper considers a more realistic

where only one source domain is available for training. In this scenario, the
limited diversity may jeopardize the model generalization on unseen target
domains. To tackle this problem, we propose a style-complement module to
enhance the generalization power of the model by synthesizing images from
diverse distributions that are complementary to the source ones. More
specifically, we adopt a tractable upper bound of mutual information (MI)
between the generated and source samples and perform a two-step optimization
iteratively: (1) by minimizing the MI upper bound approximation for each sample
pair, the generated images are forced to be diversified from the source
samples; (2) subsequently, we maximize the MI between the samples from the same
semantic category, which assists the network to learn discriminative features
from diverse-styled images. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our approach, which surpasses the

factors $F_{C}^{DW}(q)$ are expanded into $ q^4 $, where the corresponding
charge distributions are corrected by the contributions of neutron and
spin-orbit densities. In the small $ q $ region, it is found that the
experimental $|F_{C}(q)|^2$ can be well reproduced by considering the
contributions of the $\left\langle r^{4}\right\rangle_{c}$ at the small $ q $

coefficients of the $F_{C}^{DW}(q)$, the relationship between the expansion

extract the $\left\langle r^{2}\right\rangle_{c}$ and $\left\langle

and compare to current mass-loss implementation. Together with archival
multi-wavelength data, our new far-infrared continuum observations for a sample
of 25 OB stars (including 13 B Supergiants) uniquely constrain the clumping
properties of the intermediate wind region. We derive the minimum radial
stratification of the clumping factor through the stellar wind, fclmin(r), and
the corresponding maximum mass-loss rate, Mdotmax, normalising clumping factors
to the outermost wind region (clfar=1). The clumping degree for r>~2 R*
decreases or stays constant with increasing radius for almost the whole sample.
There is a dependence on luminosity class and spectral type at the intermediate
region relative to the outer ones: O Supergiants (OSGs) present a factor 2
larger clumping factors than B Supergiants (BSGs). The maximum clumping of
roughly 1/3 of the OB Supergiants occurs close to the wind base (r<~2 R*) and
then decreases monotonically. This contrasts with the more frequent case where
the lowermost clumping increases towards a maximum, and needs to be addressed
by theoretical models. Additionally, the estimated Mdotmax for BSGs is at least
one order of magnitude lower than theoretical values, whereas for OSGs our
results and predictions agree within errors. Assuming values of clfar=4-9 from
hydrodynamical models would imply a reduction of mass-loss rates included in
stellar evolution models by a factor 2-3 for OSGs and by factors 6-200 for BSGs
below the first bi-stability jump. This implies large reductions of mass-loss
rates applied in evolution-models for BSGs, independently of the actual
clumping properties of these winds, and a thorough re-investigation of BSG
mass-loss rates and their effects on stellar evolution.

effective probes to test perturbative-QCD (pQCD) calculations, to investigate
the different hadronisation mechanisms, and to study the quark-gluon plasma

performed in pp and p-Pb collisions have recently revealed unexpected features
not in line with the expectations based on previous measurements from
$\rm{e^+e^-}$ and ep collisions, showing that charm fragmentation fractions are
not universal. The investigation of initial-state effects such as shadowing in
the collision of a proton with a heavy nucleus is also performed. Measurements
of open heavy-flavour and quarkonia production in Pb-Pb collisions allow for
testing the mechanisms of heavy-quark transport, energy loss, and coalescence
effects during the hadronisation in the presence of a QCD medium. In this
contribution, the most recent results on open heavy-flavour and quarkonia

apply DR to predict the relation matrix and DW to predict the dynamic walk

possess a global-level interaction field with a local initialization.
Experiments indicate both modules' effectiveness. Moreover, DIN achieves
significant improvement compared to previous state-of-the-art methods on two

efficiently incorporate solvent effects in quantum chemistry. Even within the
recent direct approach, the multipole basis used in MPE to express the
dielectric response still solves the electrostatic problem inefficiently or not
at all for solutes larger than $\approx 10$ non-hydrogen atoms. In existing MPE
parameterizations, the resulting systematic underestimation of the
electrostatic solute-solvent interaction is presently compensated for by a
systematic overestimation of non-electrostatic attractive interactions. Even
though the MPE model can thus reproduce experimental free energies of solvation
of small molecules remarkably well, the inherent error cancellation makes it
hard to assign physical meaning to the individual free energy terms in the
model, raising concerns about transferability. Here, we resolve this issue by
solving the electrostatic problem piece-wise in 3D regions centered around all
non-hydrogen nuclei of the solute, ensuring reliable convergence of the
multipole series. The resulting method, which we call MPE-$n$c, thus allows for
a much improved reproduction of the dielectric response of a medium to a
solute. Employing a reduced non-electrostatic model with a single free
parameter, in addition to the density isovalue defining the solvation cavity,
MPE-$n$c yields free energies of solvation of neutral, anionic and cationic
solutes in water in good agreement with experiment.

crystal momentum that characterizes these ancestors, which is determined by the
mean energy of the superimposed eigenfunctions, giving rise to an effective

Moreover, these models most often operate on a single frame, which may yield
incorrect classifications in case of ambiguous viewpoints. In this paper, we
propose an active inference agent that actively gathers evidence for object
classifications, and can learn novel object categories over time. Drawing
inspiration from the human brain, we build object-centric generative models
composed of two information streams, a what- and a where-stream. The
what-stream predicts whether the observed object belongs to a specific
category, while the where-stream is responsible for representing the object in
its internal 3D reference frame. We show that our agent (i) is able to learn
representations for many object categories in an unsupervised way, (ii)
achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracies, actively resolving
ambiguity when required and (iii) identifies novel object categories.
Furthermore, we validate our system in an end-to-end fashion where the agent is
able to search for an object at a given pose from a pixel-based rendering. We
believe that this is a first step towards building modular, intelligent systems

also be advised to reconsider their choice, regarding the information pointed
out by the system. In addition, the deep learning model can be controlled, and
a present dataset bias can be found. Currently, most explainable AI methods in
the computer vision domain are purely used on image classification, where the
images are ordinary images in the visible spectrum. As a result, there is no
comparison on how the methods behave with multimodal image data, as well as
most methods have not been investigated on how they behave when used for object

saliency map generator methods on how their maps differ across the different

examine how they behave when used for object detection. As a practical problem,
we chose object detection in the infrared and visual spectrum for autonomous

show that any graph of this family admits an embedding-preserving visibility
representation whose area is $O(n^{1.5})$ and prove that this area bound is
worst-case optimal. We also show that $O(n^{1.48})$ area can be achieved if we
represent the vertices as L-shaped orthogonal polygons or if we do not respect
the embedding but still have at most one crossing per edge. We also extend the

asymptotically optimal $O(n\, pw(G))$ area bar-1-visibility representations,
where $pw(G)\in O(\log n)$ is the pathwidth of the outer-1-planar graph $G$.

learning. In this problem, the system comprises multiple agents each with local
data, and a trusted centralized coordinator. In fault-free setting, the agents
collaborate with the coordinator to find a minimizer of the aggregate of their
local cost functions defined over their local data. We consider a scenario
where some agents ($f$ out of $N$) are Byzantine faulty. Such agents need not
follow a prescribed algorithm correctly, and may communicate arbitrary
incorrect information to the coordinator. In the presence of Byzantine agents,
a more reasonable goal for the non-faulty agents is to find a minimizer of the
aggregate cost function of only the non-faulty agents. This particular goal is
commonly referred as exact fault-tolerance. Recent work has shown that exact
fault-tolerance is achievable if only if the non-faulty agents satisfy the
property of $2f$-redundancy. Now, under this property, techniques are known to
impart exact fault-tolerance to the distributed implementation of the classical
stochastic gradient-descent (SGD) algorithm. However, we do not know of any
such techniques for the federated local SGD algorithm - a more commonly used
method for federated machine learning. To address this issue, we propose a
novel technique named comparative elimination (CE). We show that, under
$2f$-redundancy, the federated local SGD algorithm with CE can indeed obtain
exact fault-tolerance in the deterministic setting when the non-faulty agents
can accurately compute gradients of their local cost functions. In the general
stochastic case, when agents can only compute unbiased noisy estimates of their
local gradients, our algorithm achieves approximate fault-tolerance with
approximation error proportional to the variance of stochastic gradients and
the fraction of Byzantine agents.

video browsing on social media platforms. To attain this goal in a data-driven
way, one may often face the situation where highlight annotations are not
available on the target video category used in practice, while the supervision
on another video category (named as source video category) is achievable. In
such a situation, one can derive an effective highlight detector on target
video category by transferring the highlight knowledge acquired from source
video category to the target one. We call this problem cross-category video
highlight detection, which has been rarely studied in previous works. For
tackling such practical problem, we propose a Dual-Learner-based Video
Highlight Detection (DL-VHD) framework. Under this framework, we first design a
Set-based Learning module (SL-module) to improve the conventional pair-based
learning by assessing the highlight extent of a video segment under a broader
context. Based on such learning manner, we introduce two different learners to
acquire the basic distinction of target category videos and the characteristics
of highlight moments on source video category, respectively. These two types of
highlight knowledge are further consolidated via knowledge distillation.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed SL-module, and the DL-VHD method outperforms five typical
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) algorithms on various cross-category
highlight detection tasks. Our code is available at

PDMP is a novel parallelised framework that uses bijective and differentiable
mappings, or diffeomorphisms, to transform sampling distributions of
sampling-based motion planners, in a manner akin to normalising flows. Unlike
normalising flow models which use invertible neural network structures to
represent these diffeomorphisms, we develop them from gradient information of
desired costs, and encode desirable behaviour, such as obstacle avoidance.
These transformed sampling distributions can then be used for sampling-based
motion planning. A particular example is when we wish to imbue the sampling
distribution with knowledge of the environment geometry, such that drawn
samples are less prone to be in collisions. To this end, we propose to learn a
continuous occupancy representation from environment occupancy data, such that
gradients of the representation defines a valid diffeomorphism and is amenable
to fast parallel evaluation. We use this to ""morph"" the sampling distribution
to draw far fewer collision-prone samples. PDMP is able to leverage gradient
information of costs, to inject specifications, in a manner similar to
optimisation-based motion planning methods, but relies on drawing from a

higher dimensional spheres. One of the key features of the 2D system is the
presence of a continuous phase transition to synchronization as the coupling
intensity increases. Ott and Antonsen proposed an ansatz for the distribution
of oscillators that allowed them to describe the dynamics of the transition's

multiple times. To cope with this challenge, approaches have been proposed
based on prediction models and machine learning. Existing approaches based on
the use of the test case vocabulary may be context-sensitive and prone to

as predictors of flaky tests. We conducted an empirical study to understand if
test smells have good performance as a classifier to predict the flakiness in

identified self-induced electron-hole plasma temperature oscillations resulting
from a dynamic competition between photoinduced carrier heating and cooling via

studied the detailed structure in the luminosity function using the data from
Gaia DR2 and PARSEC stellar evolution models with the aim to further our
understanding of young stellar populations. We analyzed the astrometric
properties of stars in the solar neighborhood (< 20 pc) and in various
relatively nearby (< 400 pc) young (< 50 Myr) open clusters and OB
associations, and compare the features in the luminosity function with those
generated by PARSEC models. The Wielen dip is confirmed in the LF of all the
populations, including the solar neighborhood, at M_G ~7 mag. The H-peak is
present in the LF of the field stars in the solar neighborhood. It likely
signals that the population is mixed with a significant number of stars younger
than 100 Myr. The H-peak is found in the LF of young open clusters and OB
associations, and its location varies with age. Our observations with Gaia DR2
confirm the evolution of the H-peak from 5 Myr up to 47 Myr. The fine structure
in the luminosity function in young stellar populations can be used to estimate
their age.

general relativity (GR) the gravitational interaction is invariant under
arbitrary scale-deformations of the metric field. In addition, we assume that
the scaling field has an internal symmetry. The global charges that are
associated with this symmetry could potentially source the gravitational field.
In the case that isotropic deformations are considered, the theory reduces to a
Weyl-invariant (WI) version of GR. In the case that Minkowski spacetime is
deformed the vierbein formalism is recovered, rendering GR a field theory on
Minkowski spacetime. A few implications of a classical Weyl-invariant

crystals excited by interdigitated transducers, and is characterized by large
single-photon optomechanical coupling strength, limited intracavity pump photon
population to avoid absorption-induced heating, and low phonon injection
efficiency from the transducer to the optomechanical cavity. The second
approach uses (quasi) bulk acoustic wave resonators integrated into photonic
Fabry-Perot cavity geometries, and is characterized by low single-photon
optomechanical coupling strength, high intracavity pump photon population
without significant heating, and high phonon injection efficiency. After
reviewing the current status of both approaches, we discuss the need for
co-designing the electromechanical and optomechanical sub-systems in order to
achieve high transduction efficiencies, taking the GaAs piezo-optomechanical
platform as an example.

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). The advantage of these models is their ability
to handle high-dimensional state-space and learn compact surrogate
representations of the operational state spaces. However, the problem is that
the sampled observations used for training the model may never cover the entire
state space of the physical environment, and as a result, the system will
likely operate in conditions that do not belong to the training distribution.
These conditions that do not belong to training distribution are referred to as
Out-of-Distribution (OOD). Detecting OOD conditions at runtime is critical for
the safety of CPS. In addition, it is also desirable to identify the context or
the feature(s) that are the source of OOD to select an appropriate control
action to mitigate the consequences that may arise because of the OOD
condition. In this paper, we study this problem as a multi-labeled time series
OOD detection problem over images, where the OOD is defined both sequentially
across short time windows (change points) as well as across the training data
distribution. A common approach to solving this problem is the use of
multi-chained one-class classifiers. However, this approach is expensive for
CPSs that have limited computational resources and require short inference
times. Our contribution is an approach to design and train a single
$\beta$-Variational Autoencoder detector with a partially disentangled latent
space sensitive to variations in image features. We use the feature sensitive
latent variables in the latent space to detect OOD images and identify the most
likely feature(s) responsible for the OOD. We demonstrate our approach using an
Autonomous Vehicle in the CARLA simulator and a real-world automotive dataset
called nuImages.

key component to design the new generation of OR support systems. Computer
vision models for person pixel-based segmentation and body-keypoints detection
are needed to better understand the clinical activities and the spatial layout
of the OR. This is challenging, not only because OR images are very different
from traditional vision datasets, but also because data and annotations are
hard to collect and generate in the OR due to privacy concerns. To address
these concerns, we first study how joint person pose estimation and instance
segmentation can be performed on low resolutions images with downsampling
factors from 1x to 12x. Second, to address the domain shift and the lack of
annotations, we propose a novel unsupervised domain adaptation method, called
AdaptOR, to adapt a model from an in-the-wild labeled source domain to a
statistically different unlabeled target domain. We propose to exploit explicit
geometric constraints on the different augmentations of the unlabeled target
domain image to generate accurate pseudo labels and use these pseudo labels to
train the model on high- and low-resolution OR images in a self-training
framework. Furthermore, we propose disentangled feature normalization to handle
the statistically different source and target domain data. Extensive
experimental results with detailed ablation studies on the two OR datasets
MVOR+ and TUM-OR-test show the effectiveness of our approach against strongly
constructed baselines, especially on the low-resolution privacy-preserving OR
images. Finally, we show the generality of our method as a semi-supervised

comparable results with as few as 1% of labeled supervision against a model

\emph{Fermi} localization typically prevents rapid identification of
multi-wavelength counterparts. We report the follow-up of 93 \emph{Fermi} GRBs
with the Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO) prototype on La
Palma. We selected 53 events (based on favourable observing conditions) for
detailed analysis, and to demonstrate our strategy of searching for optical
counterparts. We apply a filtering process consisting of both automated and
manual steps to 60\,085 candidates initially, rejecting all but 29, arising
from 15 events. With $\approx3$ GRB afterglows expected to be detectable with
GOTO from our sample, most of the candidates are unlikely to be related to the
GRBs. Since we did not have multiple observations for those candidates, we
cannot confidently confirm the association between the transients and the GRBs.
Our results show that GOTO can effectively search for GRB optical counterparts
thanks to its large field of view of $\approx40$ square degrees and its depth
of $\approx20$ mag. We also detail several methods to improve our overall

This correlation was recently found to hold for shell-model calculations,
energy-density functionals, and other nuclear structure models. We therefore
first calculate the nuclear matrix elements for double Gamow-Teller transitions
in the EFT for heavy nuclei. The combination of the EFT uncertainty with the
correlation uncertainty enables predictions of nuclear matrix elements for
neutrinoless double-beta decay for a broad range of isotopes with quantified
uncertainties. Generally the EFT predicts smaller nuclear matrix elements

they mentioned other people: self-focused and other-focused. Examples of
self-focused sentences are ""I am feeling good"". The other-focused sentences
were further classified into different levels. These levels differ by whether
the writer 1) mentions the presence of others without inferring their mental
state(e.g., I saw a man walking down the street), 2) fails to take the
perspective of others (e.g., I don't understand why they refuse to wear masks),
or 3) successfully takes the perspective of others (It must have been hard for
them to continue working). We tested whether state-of-the-art transformer-based
models (e.g., BERT) could predict underlying ToM levels in sentences. We found
that BERT more successfully detected self-focused sentences than other-focused
ones. Sentences that successfully take the perspective of others (the highest
ToM level) were the most difficult to predict. Our study suggests a promising
direction for large-scale and computational approaches for identifying the
ability of authors to empathize and take the perspective of others. The dataset

set up a feature memory module, which is updated dynamically during training,

learn class probability distribution of each pixel representation under the

each pixel is augmented by aggregating the dataset-level representations based
on the corresponding class probability distribution. Furthermore, by utilizing
the stored dataset-level representations, we also propose a representation
consistent learning strategy to make the classification head better address
intra-class compactness and inter-class dispersion. The proposed method could
be effortlessly incorporated into existing segmentation frameworks (e.g., FCN,

to reach this goal. We explore the capabilities of the software package Transit
and Light Curve Modeller (TLCM). It is able to perform a joint radial velocity
and light curve fit or light curve fit only. It models the transit,
occultation, beaming, ellipsoidal and reflection effects in the light curves
(including the gravity darkening effect, too). The red-noise, the stellar
variability and instrumental effects are modelled via wavelets. The wavelet-fit
is constrained by prescribing that the final white noise level must be equal to
the average of the uncertainties of the photometric data points. This helps to
avoid the overfit and regularizes the noise model. The approach was tested by
injecting synthetic light curves into Kepler's short cadence data and then
modelling them. The method performs well over a certain signal-to-noise (S/N)
ratio. In general a S/N ratio of 10 is needed to get good results but some
parameters requires larger S/N, some others can be retrieved at lower S/Ns. We
give limits in terms of signal-to-noise ratio for every studied system

is able to manage and to remove the impacts of data discontinuities, cosmic ray

Fourier non-uniqueness set thus obtained is a discrete subset of the union of

Stoller. Using a different construction involving the codifferent of $K$, we
prove an analogue of our results for discrete subsets of ellipsoids. In special

fewer points on each.

prove that, if $n \geq 2$ and if a certain group $\Gamma_{\Lambda} \leq

formulas cannot exist. Motivated by these more general considerations, we
revisit the case of one radial variable and prove, for all $n \geq 5$ and all

responses labeled with offensive language and stance. Our analysis reveals that
42% of human responses agree with toxic comments, whereas only 13% agree with
safe comments. This undesirable behavior is learned by neural dialogue models,
such as DialoGPT, which we show are two times more likely to agree with
offensive comments. To enable automatic detection of offensive language, we
fine-tuned transformer-based classifiers on ToxiChat that achieve 0.71 F1 for
offensive labels and 0.53 Macro-F1 for stance labels. Finally, we quantify the
effectiveness of controllable text generation (CTG) methods to mitigate the
tendency of neural dialogue models to agree with offensive comments. Compared
to the baseline, our best CTG model achieves a 19% reduction in agreement with
offensive comments and produces 29% fewer offensive replies. Our work
highlights the need for further efforts to characterize and analyze
inappropriate behavior in dialogue models, in order to help make them safer.

and kinematic properties of halo coronal mass ejections (CMEs). In this paper,
a revised cone model is proposed to investigate the properties of CMEs as a
result of non-radial prominence eruptions. The cone apex is located at the
source region of an eruption instead of the Sun center. The cone axis deviates
from the local vertical by an inclination angle of $\theta_1$ and an angle of
$\phi_1$. The length and angular width of the cone are $r$ and $\omega$,
respectively. The model is successfully applied to two CMEs originating from
the western limb on 2011 August 11 and 2012 December 7. By comparing the
projections of the cones with the CME fronts simultaneously observed by the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO) and the Extreme-Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI) on board the ahead Solar
TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO), the properties of the CMEs are
derived, including the distance, angular width, inclination angle, deviation
from the plane of the sky, and true speed in space. This revised cone model
provides a new and complementary approach in exploring the whole evolutions of
CMEs.

30% of all lung cancer subtypes, respectively, and display broad heterogeneity
in terms of clinical and molecular responses to therapy. Molecular subtyping
has enabled precision medicine to overcome these challenges and provide
significant biological insights to predict prognosis and improve clinical
decision making. Over the past decade, conventional ML algorithms and DL-based
CNNs have been espoused for the classification of cancer subtypes from gene
expression datasets. However, these methods are potentially biased toward
identification of cancer biomarkers. Recently proposed transformer-based
architectures that leverage the self-attention mechanism encode high throughput
gene expressions and learn representations that are computationally complex and
parametrically expensive. However, compared to the datasets for natural
language processing applications, gene expression consists of several hundreds
of thousands of genes from a limited number of observations, making it
difficult to efficiently train transformers for bioinformatics applications.
Hence, we propose an end-to-end deep learning approach, Gene Transformer, which
addresses the complexity of high-dimensional gene expression with a multi-head
self-attention module by identifying relevant biomarkers across multiple cancer
subtypes without requiring feature selection as a prerequisite for the current
classification algorithms. The proposed architecture achieved an overall
improved performance for all evaluation metrics and had fewer misclassification
errors than the commonly used traditional classification algorithms. The
classification results show that Gene Transformer can be an efficient approach
for classifying cancer subtypes, indicating that any improvement in deep
learning models in computational biology can also be reflected well in this
domain.

imposing queue tolls on passengers to incentivize them to change their choice

Kepler has revealed their deep internal structure. These modes allow us to
characterize the pattern of pressure modes (through the measurement of their
asymptotic frequency separation $\Delta\nu$) and the pattern of gravity modes
(through the determination of their asymptotic period spacing $\Delta\Pi_1$).
It has been shown that red giant branch (RGB) stars regroup on a well-defined
sequence in the $\Delta\nu$-$\Delta\Pi_1$ plane. Our first goal is to
theoretically explain the features of this sequence and understand how it can
be used to probe the interiors of red giants. Using a grid of red giant models
computed with MESA, we demonstrate that red giants join the
$\Delta\nu$-$\Delta\Pi_1$ sequence whenever electron degeneracy becomes strong
in the core. We argue that this can be used to estimate the central densities
of these stars, and potentially to measure the amount of core overshooting
during the main sequence part of the evolution. We also investigate a puzzling
subsample of red giants that are located below the RGB sequence, in
contradiction with stellar evolution models. After checking the measurements of
the asymptotic period spacing for these stars, we show that they are mainly
intermediate-mass red giants. This is doubly peculiar because these stars
should have nondegenerate cores and are expected to be located well above the
RGB sequence. We show that these peculiarities are well accounted for if these
stars result from the interaction between two low-mass ($M\lesssim2\,M_\odot$)
close companions during the red giant branch phase. If the secondary component
has already developed a degenerate core before mass transfer begins, it becomes
an intermediate-mass giant with a degenerate core. The secondary star is then
located below the degenerate sequence, in agreement with the observations.

as spin glasses, a low-temperature Gibbs state may be a mixture of a number of
pure or ordered states; the complexity of the Gibbs state has been defined in
the past roughly as the logarithm of this number, assuming the question is
meaningful in a finite system. As non-trivial mixtures of pure states do not
occur in finite size, in a recent paper [Phys. Rev. E 101, 042114 (2020)]
H\""oller and the author introduced a definition of the complexity of an
infinite-size Gibbs state as the mutual information between the pure state and
the spin configuration in a finite region, and applied this also within a
metastate construction. (A metastate is a probability distribution on Gibbs
states.) They found an upper bound on the complexity for models of Ising spins
in which each spin interacts with only a finite number of others, in terms of
the surface area of the region, for all $T\geq 0$. In the present paper, the
complexity of a metastate is defined likewise in terms of the mutual
information between the Gibbs state and the spin configuration. Upper bounds
are found for each of these complexities for general finite-range (i.e. short-
or long-range, in a sense we define) mixed $p$-spin interactions of discrete or
continuous spins (such as $m$-vector models), but only for $T>0$. For
short-range models, the bound reduces to the surface area. For long-range
interactions, the definition of a Gibbs state has to be modified, and for these
models we also prove that the states obtained within the metastate
constructions are Gibbs states under the modified definition. All results are
valid for a large class of disorder distributions.

poloidal magnetic field and the other with a dominant toroidal component, and
study the poloidal and toroidal field energies, the growth times of the various

poloidal setup generates a toroidal field which later decays exponentially
reaching 1% of the total magnetic energy, showing no evidence of reaching
equilibrium. The initially stronger toroidal field setup, on the other hand,
loses up to 20% of toroidal energy and maintains this state till the end of our

numerical simulations (DNSs) has seen recent interest for reducing the
computational load for fluid simulations. Here, we focus on determining a
flux-limiter for shock capturing methods. Focusing on flux limiters provides a
specific plug-and-play component for existing numerical methods. Since their
introduction, an array of flux limiters has been designed. Using the
coarse-grained Burgers' equation, we show that flux-limiters may be
rank-ordered in terms of their log-error relative to high-resolution data. We
then develop theory to find an optimal flux-limiter and present flux-limiters
that outperform others tested for integrating Burgers' equation on lattices
with $2\times$, $3\times$, $4\times$, and $8\times$ coarse-grainings. We train
a continuous piecewise linear limiter by minimizing the mean-squared misfit to
6-grid point segments of high-resolution data, averaged over all segments.
While flux limiters are generally designed to have an output of $\phi(r) = 1$
at a flux ratio of $r = 1$, our limiters are not bound by this rule, and yet
produce a smaller error than standard limiters. We find that our machine
learned limiters have distinctive features that may provide new rules-of-thumb
for the development of improved limiters. Additionally, we use our theory to
learn flux-limiters that outperform standard limiters across a range of values
(as opposed to at a specific fixed value) of coarse-graining, number of
discretized bins, and diffusion parameter. This demonstrates the ability to
produce flux limiters that should be more broadly useful than standard limiters

Lead-Less Implanted Electronic Devices (LLIEDs), easily overlooked or
misidentified on a frontal view (often only acquired), is common. Although most
LLIED types are ""MRI conditional"": 1. Some are stringently conditional; 2.
Different conditional types have specific patient- or device- management
requirements; and 3. Particular types are ""MRI unsafe"". This work focused on
developing CXR interpretation-assisting Artificial Intelligence (AI)
methodology with: 1. 100% detection for LLIED presence/location; and 2. High
classification in LLIED typing. Materials & Methods: Data-mining
(03/1993-02/2021) produced an AI Model Development Population (1,100
patients/4,871 images) creating 4,924 LLIED Region-Of-Interests (ROIs) (with
image-quality grading) used in Training, Validation, and Testing. For
developing the cascading neural network (detection via Faster R-CNN and
classification via Inception V3), ""ground-truth"" CXR annotation (ROI labeling
per LLIED), as well as inference display (as Generated Bounding Boxes (GBBs)),
relied on a GPU-based graphical user interface. Results: To achieve 100% LLIED
detection, probability threshold reduction to 0.00002 was required by Model 1,
resulting in increasing GBBs per LLIED-related ROI. Targeting LLIED-type
classification following detection of all LLIEDs, Model 2 multi-classified to
reach high-performance while decreasing falsely positive GBBs. Despite 24%
suboptimal ROI image quality, classification was correct in 98.9% and AUCs for
the 9 LLIED-types were 1.00 for 8 and 0.92 for 1. For all misclassification
cases: 1. None involved stringently conditional or unsafe LLIEDs; and 2. Most
were attributable to suboptimal images. Conclusion: This project successfully
developed a LLIED-related AI methodology supporting: 1. 100% detection; and 2.
Typically 100% type classification.

Congestion pricing means that the operator increases prices at the time of
congestion and the traffic demand are expected to decrease. In a certain sense,
shadow prices are an optimal way of congestion pricing: users are charged
shadow prices, i.e., the expectations of future losses because of blocked
connections. The shadow prices can be calculated exactly from the Howard
equation, but this method is difficult. The paper presents simple
approximations to the solution of the Howard equation and a way to derive more
exact approximations. If users do not react by lowering their demand, they will
receive higher bills to pay. Many users do not react to increased prices but
would want to know how the congestion pricing mechanism affects the bills. The
distribution of the price of a connection follows from knowing the shadow
prices and the probability of a congestion state. There is another interesting
distribution. The network produces profit to the operator, or equivalently,
blocked connections produce a cost to the operator. The average cost rate can
be calculated from the Howard equation, but the costs have some distribution.
The distribution gives the risk that the actual costs exceed the average costs,
and the operator should include this risk in the prices. The main result of
this paper shows how to calculate the distribution of the costs in the future
for congestion pricing by shadow prices and for congestion pricing with a more
simple pricing scheme that produces the same average costs.

high velocity. One of the possible physical explanations is that a supernova in
a compact binary system results in a high recoil velocity of the system. If the
system remains bound, it can be subsequently observed as a spectroscopic binary
(SB1), a high-mass X-ray binary, a compact binary, and finally a
gravitational-wave event. If such a system is traced back to its parent
cluster, binary evolution models can be tested in great detail. The Gaia proper
motions and parallaxes are used to demonstrate that the high-mass X-ray binary
HD153919/4U 1700-37 originates from NGC6231, the nucleus of the OB association
Sco OB1. The O supergiant and its compact companion, of which the physical
nature (a neutron star or a black hole) is unknown, move with a space velocity
of 63 km/s with respect to NGC6231. The kinematical age of the system is 2.2
Myr. The parallaxes and accurate proper motions in Gaia DR2 were used to
perform a membership analysis of NGC 6231. The distance to NGC6231 is 1.63 kpc.
Isochrone fitting results in an age of 4.7 Myr. With the identification of
NGC6231 as the parent cluster, the upper limit on the age of the progenitor of
4U1700-37 at the moment of the supernova explosion is 3.0 Myr. With these
constraints, the evolutionary history of the system can be reconstructed with
an initial mass of the progenitor of the compact object >60 Msun. Given its
current high space velocity and the derived evolutionary history, the compact
object in the system is more likely to have received a large natal kick, which
suggests that it is more likely a neutron star than a black hole.

(TEEs) has been accelerating the adaptation of new applications using TEEs.
Recent studies showed that a cloud application consists of multiple distributed
software modules provided by mutually distrustful parties. The applications use
multiple TEEs (enclaves) communicating through software-encrypted memory
channels. Such execution model requires bi-directional protection: protecting
the rest of the system from the enclave module with sandboxing and protecting
the enclave module from a third-part module and operating systems. However, the
current TEE model, such as Intel SGX, cannot efficiently represent such
distributed sandbox applications. To overcome the lack of hardware supports for
sandboxed TEEs, this paper proposes an extended enclave model called Stockade,
which supports distributed sandboxes hardened by hardware. Stockade proposes
new three key techniques. First, it extends the hardware-based memory isolation
in SGX to confine a user software module only within its enclave. Second, it
proposes a trusted monitor enclave that filters and validates systems calls
from enclaves. Finally, it allows hardware-protected memory sharing between a
pair of enclaves for efficient protected communication without software-based
encryption. Using an emulated SGX platform with the proposed extensions, this
paper shows that distributed sandbox applications can be effectively supported
with small changes of SGX hardware.

  Hybrid GARCH-LSTMs","30 pages",,,,"q-fin.ST cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Several academics have studied the ability of hybrid models mixing univariate
Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models and
neural networks to deliver better volatility predictions than purely
econometric models. Despite presenting very promising results, the
generalization of such models to the multivariate case has yet to be studied.
Moreover, very few papers have examined the ability of neural networks to
predict the covariance matrix of asset returns, and all use a rather small
number of assets, thus not addressing what is known as the curse of
dimensionality. The goal of this paper is to investigate the ability of hybrid
models, mixing GARCH processes and neural networks, to forecast covariance
matrices of asset returns. To do so, we propose a new model, based on
multivariate GARCHs that decompose volatility and correlation predictions. The
volatilities are here forecast using hybrid neural networks while correlations
follow a traditional econometric process. After implementing the models in a
minimum variance portfolio framework, our results are as follows. First, the
addition of GARCH parameters as inputs is beneficial to the model proposed.
Second, the use of one-hot-encoding to help the neural network differentiate

very promising as it not only outperforms the equally weighted portfolio, but
also by a significant margin its econometric counterpart that uses univariate
GARCHs to predict the volatilities.

  joint parking and mode choice model: A case from urban India","36 pages, 2 figures","Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 2023","10.1016/j.tra.2023.103610",,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The concept of transportation demand management (TDM) upholds the development
of sustainable mobility through the triumph of optimally balanced transport
modal share in cities. The modal split management directly reflects on TDM of
each transport subsystem, including parking. In developing countries, the
policy-makers have largely focused on supply-side measures, yet demand-side
measures have remained unaddressed in policy implications. Ample literature is
available presenting responses of TDM strategies, but most studies account mode
choice and parking choice behaviour separately rather than considering
trade-offs between them. Failing to do so may lead to biased model estimates
and impropriety in policy implications. This paper seeks to fill this gap by
admitting parking choice as an endogenous decision within the model of mode
choice behaviour. This study integrates attitudinal factors and
built-environment variables in addition to parking and travel attributes for
developing comprehensive estimation results. A mixed logit model with random
coefficients is estimated using hierarchical Bayes approach based on the Markov
Chain Monte Carlo simulation method. The results reveal significant influence
of mode/parking specific attitudes on commuters choice behaviour in addition to
the built-environment factors and mode/parking related attributes. It is
identified that considerable shift is occurring between parking-types in
preference to switching travel mode with hypothetical changes in parking
attributes. Besides, study investigates the heterogeneity in the
willingness-to-pay through a follow-up regression model, which provides
important insights for identifying possible sources of this heterogeneity among
respondents. The study provides remarkable results which may be beneficial to
planning authorities for improving TDM strategies especially in developing
countries.

significantly in the last decade, such that it is no longer solely in the
domain of research labs, but is now beginning to be developed for, and applied
in, industrial applications and products. With the emergence of this new
quantum industry, a new workforce trained in QIST skills and knowledge is
needed. To help support education and training of this workforce, universities
and colleges require knowledge of the type of jobs available for their students
and what skills and degrees are most relevant for those new jobs. Additionally,
students need to know how to tailor their degrees to best align with the
current needs of the quantum industry. We report on the results from a survey
of 57 companies in the quantum industry, with the goal of elucidating the jobs,
skills, and degrees that are relevant for this new workforce. We find a range
of job opportunities from highly specific jobs, such as quantum algorithm
developer and error correction scientist, to broader jobs categories within the
business, software, and hardware sectors. These broader jobs require a range of
skills, most of which are not quantum related. Further, except for the highly
specific jobs, companies that responded to the survey are looking for a range
of degree levels to fill these new positions, from bachelors to masters to
PhDs. With this knowledge, students, instructors, and university administrators
can make informed decisions about how to address the challenge of increasing
the future quantum workforce.

  Interface under Time Constraints",,,,,"q-bio.NC cs.LG stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The decoding of brain signals recorded via, e.g., an electroencephalogram,
using machine learning is key to brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Stimulation
parameters or other experimental settings of the BCI protocol typically are
chosen according to the literature. The decoding performance directly depends
on the choice of parameters, as they influence the elicited brain signals and
optimal parameters are subject-dependent. Thus a fast and automated selection
procedure for experimental parameters could greatly improve the usability of
BCIs.
  We evaluate a standalone random search and a combined Bayesian optimization
with random search in a closed-loop auditory event-related potential protocol.
We aimed at finding the individually best stimulation speed -- also known as
stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) -- that maximizes the classification
performance of a regularized linear discriminant analysis. To make the Bayesian
optimization feasible under noise and the time pressure posed by an online BCI
experiment, we first used offline simulations to initialize and constrain the
internal optimization model. Then we evaluated our approach online with 13
healthy subjects.
  We could show that for 8 out of 13 subjects, the proposed approach using
Bayesian optimization succeeded to select the individually optimal SOA out of
multiple evaluated SOA values. Our data suggests, however, that subjects were
influenced to very different degrees by the SOA parameter. This makes the
automatic parameter selection infeasible for subjects where the influence is
limited.
  Our work proposes an approach to exploit the benefits of individualized
experimental protocols and evaluated it in an auditory BCI. When applied to
other experimental parameters our approach could enhance the usability of BCI
for different target groups -- specifically if an individual disease progress
may prevent the use of standard parameters.

  Atomistic Structure",,,,,"q-bio.BM cs.LG physics.data-an q-bio.MN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Coarse-graining is a powerful tool for extending the reach of dynamic models
of proteins and other biological macromolecules. Topological coarse-graining,
in which biomolecules or sets thereof are represented via graph structures, is
a particularly useful way of obtaining highly compressed representations of
molecular structure, and simulations operating via such representations can
achieve substantial computational savings. A drawback of coarse-graining,
however, is the loss of atomistic detail - an effect that is especially acute
for topological representations such as protein structure networks (PSNs).
Here, we introduce an approach based on a combination of machine learning and
physically-guided refinement for inferring atomic coordinates from PSNs. This
""neural upscaling"" procedure exploits the constraints implied by PSNs on
possible configurations, as well as differences in the likelihood of observing
different configurations with the same PSN. Using a 1 $\mu$s atomistic
molecular dynamics trajectory of A$\beta_{1-40}$, we show that neural upscaling
is able to effectively recapitulate detailed structural information for
intrinsically disordered proteins, being particularly successful in recovering
features such as transient secondary structure. These results suggest that
scalable network-based models for protein structure and dynamics may be used in
settings where atomistic detail is desired, with upscaling employed to impute
atomic coordinates from PSNs.
