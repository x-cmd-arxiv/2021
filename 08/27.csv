  Regression in Linear Models?",,,,,"math.ST cs.LG math.OC stat.ML stat.TH","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Methods for learning from data depend on various types of tuning parameters,
such as penalization strength or step size. Since performance can depend
strongly on these parameters, it is important to compare classes of
estimators-by considering prescribed finite sets of tuning parameters-not just
particularly tuned methods. In this work, we investigate classes of methods via
the relative performance of the best method in the class. We consider the
central problem of linear regression-with a random isotropic ground truth-and
investigate the estimation performance of two fundamental methods, gradient
descent and ridge regression. We unveil the following phenomena. (1) For
general designs, constant stepsize gradient descent outperforms ridge
regression when the eigenvalues of the empirical data covariance matrix decay
slowly, as a power law with exponent less than unity. If instead the
eigenvalues decay quickly, as a power law with exponent greater than unity or
exponentially, we show that ridge regression outperforms gradient descent. (2)
For orthogonal designs, we compute the exact minimax optimal class of
estimators (achieving min-max-min optimality), showing it is equivalent to
gradient descent with decaying learning rate. We find the sub-optimality of
ridge regression and gradient descent with constant step size. Our results
highlight that statistical performance can depend strongly on tuning
parameters. In particular, while optimally tuned ridge regression is the best
estimator in our setting, it can be outperformed by gradient descent by an
arbitrary/unbounded amount when both methods are only tuned over finitely many
regularization parameters.

  Forecasting?","Accepted by SIGSPATIAL 2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning models are modern tools for spatio-temporal graph (STG)
forecasting. Though successful, we argue that data scarcity is a key factor
limiting their recent improvements. Meanwhile, contrastive learning has been an
effective method for providing self-supervision signals and addressing data
scarcity in various domains. In view of this, one may ask: can we leverage the
additional signals from contrastive learning to alleviate data scarcity, so as
to benefit STG forecasting? To answer this question, we present the first
systematic exploration on incorporating contrastive learning into STG
forecasting. Specifically, we first elaborate two potential schemes for
integrating contrastive learning. We then propose two feasible and efficient
designs of contrastive tasks that are performed on the node or graph level. The
empirical study on STG benchmarks demonstrates that integrating graph-level
contrast with the joint learning scheme achieves the best performance. In
addition, we introduce four augmentations for STG data, which perturb the data
in terms of graph structure, time domain, and frequency domain. Experimental
results reveal that the model is not sensitive to the proposed augmentations'
semantics. Lastly, we extend the classic contrastive loss via a rule-based
strategy that filters out the most semantically similar negatives, yielding
performance gains. We also provide explanations and insights based on the above
experimental findings. Code is available at https://github.com/liuxu77/STGCL.

time series forecasting applied to environmental datasets. The framework was
evaluated across multiple sensors and for three different oceanic variables:
current speed, temperature, and dissolved oxygen. Network implementation
proceeded in two directions that are nominally separated but connected as part
of a natural environmental system -- across the spatial (between individual
sensors) and temporal components of the sensor data. Data from four sensors
sampling current speed, and eight measuring both temperature and dissolved
oxygen evaluated the framework. Results were compared against RF and XGB
baseline models that learned on the temporal signal of each sensor
independently by extracting the date-time features together with the past
history of data using sliding window matrix. Results demonstrated ability to
accurately replicate complex signals and provide comparable performance to
state-of-the-art benchmarks. Notably, the novel framework provided a simpler
pre-processing and training pipeline that handles missing values via a simple
masking layer. Enabling learning across the spatial and temporal directions,
this paper addresses two fundamental challenges of ML applications to
environmental science: 1) data sparsity and the challenges and costs of
collecting measurements of environmental conditions such as ocean dynamics, and
2) environmental datasets are inherently connected in the spatial and temporal
directions while classical ML approaches only consider one of these directions.
Furthermore, sharing of parameters across all input steps makes SPATIAL a fast,
scalable, and easily-parameterized forecasting framework.

process, known as violent relaxation, takes place on a much shorter time scale

inequalities from identical agents on an equal opportunity landscape. These
inequalities arise in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium regimes with some
societies essentially never reaching equilibrium. Reproduction costs mitigate
inequality beyond their affect on intrinsic growth rate. The highest levels of
inequality are found during non-equilibrium regimes. Inequality in dynamic
regimes is driven by factors different than those driving steady state
inequality. Evolutionary pressures drive the intrinsic growth rate as high as
possible, leading to a tragedy of the commons.

relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations of accretion onto the
supermassive black hole in M87. The simulations self-consistently evolve a
frequency-dependent Monte Carlo description of the radiation field produced by
the accretion flow. We explore two limits of accumulated magnetic flux at the
black hole (SANE and MAD), each coupled to several sub-grid prescriptions for
electron heating that are motivated by models of turbulence and magnetic
reconnection. We present convergence studies for the radiation field and study
its properties. We find that the near-horizon photon energy density is an order
of magnitude higher than is predicted by simple isotropic estimates from the
observed luminosity. The radially dependent photon momentum distribution is
anisotropic and can be modeled by a set of point-sources near the equatorial
plane. We draw properties of the radiation and magnetic field from the
simulation and feed them into an analytic model of gap acceleration to estimate
the very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray luminosity from the magnetized jet funnel,
assuming that a gap is able to form. We find luminosities of $\rm \sim 10^{41}
\, erg \, s^{-1}$ for MAD models and $\rm \sim 2\times 10^{40} \, erg \,
s^{-1}$ for SANE models, which are comparable to measurements of M87's VHE
flares. The time-dependence seen in our calculations is insufficient to explain
the flaring behavior. Our results provide a step towards bridging theoretical
models of near-horizon properties seen in black hole images with the VHE
activity of M87.

extremely accurate dynamics that preserve not only intrinsic geometric

$^{39}$K atoms trapped in a near-detuned ($780$ nm) optical tweezer, which
leads to relatively minor differential (ground vs. excited state) Stark shifts.
We demonstrate that simple and robust loading, cooling, and imaging can be
achieved through a combined addressing of the D$_\textrm{1}$ and D$_\textrm{2}$
transitions. While imaging on the D$_\textrm{2}$ transition, we can
simultaneously apply $\Lambda$-enhanced gray molasses (GM) on the
D$_\textrm{1}$ transition, preserving low backgrounds for single-atom imaging
through spectral filtering. Using D$_\textrm{1}$ cooling during and after trap
loading, we demonstrate enhanced loading efficiencies as well as cooling to low

for robust single-mode lasers. A typical topological laser employs a
single-mode topological edge state, which appears deterministically in a
designed topological bandgap and exhibits robustness to disorder. These
properties seem to be highly attractive in pursuit of high power lasers capable
of single mode operation. In this paper, we theoretically analyze a large-scale
single-mode laser based on a topological edge state. We consider a sizable
array laser consisting of a few hundreds of site resonators, which support a
single topological edge mode broadly distributed among the resonators. We build
a basic model describing the laser using the tight binding approximation and
evaluate the stability of single mode lasing based on the threshold gain
difference $\Delta\alpha$ between the first-lasing edge mode and the
second-lasing competing bulk mode. Our calculations demonstrate that stronger
couplings between the cavities and lower losses are advantageous for achieving
stable operation of the device. When assuming an average coupling of 100
cm$^{-1}$ between site resonators and other realistic parameters, the threshold
gain difference $\Delta\alpha$ can reach about 2 cm$^{-1}$, which would be
sufficient for stable single mode lasing using a conventional semiconductor
laser architecture. We also consider the effects of possible disorders and
long-range interactions to assess the robustness of the laser under non-ideal
situations. These results lay the groundwork for developing single-mode
high-power topological lasers.

best knowledge, this is the first study that concentrates on the clustering and
tracking of multipath components (MPCs) for time-varying AG channels. Based on
measurement data at 6.5 GHz with 500 MHz of bandwidth, we first estimate
potential MPCs utilizing the space-alternating generalized
expectation-maximization (SAGE) algorithm. Then, we cluster the extracted MPCs
considering their static and dynamic characteristics by employing K-Power-Means
(KPM) algorithm under multipath component distance (MCD) measure. For
characterizing time-variant clusters, we exploit a clustering-based tracking
(CBT) method, which efficiently quantifies the survival lengths of clusters.
Ultimately, we establish a cluster-based channel model, and validations
illustrate the accuracy of the proposed model. This work not only promotes a
better understanding of AG propagation channels but also provides a general
cluster-based AG channel model with certain extensibility.

we conducted a multiple-case study exploring the design thinking and creativity
of co-located and distributed software developers in a collaborative design

spend less time on exploring the problem space, which could be related to
different socio-technical challenges, such as lack of awareness and common

of their activities. Conclusion: Developers engaging in collaborative design
need to be aware that problem space exploration is reduced in a distributed
setting. Unless distributed teams take compensatory measures, this could
adversely affect the development. Regarding the effect distance has on
creativity, our results are inconclusive and further studies are needed.

targeting for APOGEE-2 is complex and has evolved with time. In this paper, we
present the updates and additions to the initial targeting strategy for
APOGEE-2N presented in Zasowski et al. (2017). These modifications come in two
implementation modes: (i) ""Ancillary Science Programs"" competitively awarded to
SDSS-IV PIs through proposal calls in 2015 and 2017 for the pursuit of new
scientific avenues outside the main survey, and (ii) an effective 1.5-year
expansion of the survey, known as the Bright Time Extension, made possible
through accrued efficiency gains over the first years of the APOGEE-2N project.
For the 23 distinct ancillary programs, we provide descriptions of the
scientific aims, target selection, and how to identify these targets within the
APOGEE-2 sample. The Bright Time Extension permitted changes to the main survey
strategy, the inclusion of new programs in response to scientific discoveries
or to exploit major new datasets not available at the outset of the survey
design, and expansions of existing programs to enhance their scientific success
and reach. After describing the motivations, implementation, and assessment of
these programs, we also leave a summary of lessons learned from nearly a decade

spectroscopic survey of the Milky Way. The second generation of the APOGEE
project, APOGEE-2, includes an expansion of the survey to the Southern
Hemisphere called APOGEE-2S. This expansion enabled APOGEE to perform a fully
panoramic mapping of all the main regions of the Milky Way; in particular, by
operating in the H-band, APOGEE is uniquely able to probe the dust-hidden inner
regions of the Milky Way that are best accessed from the Southern Hemisphere.
In this paper we present the targeting strategy of APOGEE-2S, with special
attention to documenting modifications to the original, previously published
plan. The motivation for these changes is explained as well as an assessment of
their effectiveness in achieving their intended scientific objective. In
anticipation of this being the last paper detailing APOGEE targeting, we
present an accounting of all such information complete through the end of the
APOGEE-2S project; this includes several main survey programs dedicated to
exploration of major stellar populations and regions of the Milky Way, as well
as a full list of programs contributing to the APOGEE database through
allocations of observing time by the Chilean National Time Allocation Committee
(CNTAC) and the Carnegie Institution for Science (CIS). This work was presented
along with a companion article, R. Beaton et al. (submitted; AAS29028),
presenting the final target selection strategy adopted for APOGEE-2 in the
Northern Hemisphere.

problem of finding consistent partial maps among all pairs of objects within a
collection, is a crucial task in many areas of computer vision. This problem
subsumes bipartite graph matching and graph partitioning as special cases and
is NP-hard, in general. We develop scalable linear programming (LP) relaxations
with theoretical performance guarantees for joint object matching. We start by
proposing a new characterization of consistent partial maps; this in turn
enables us to formulate joint object matching as an integer linear programming
(ILP) problem. To construct strong LP relaxations, we study the facial
structure of the convex hull of the feasible region of this ILP, which we refer
to as the joint matching polytope. We present an exponential family of
facet-defining inequalities that can be separated in strongly polynomial time,
hence obtaining a partial characterization of the joint matching polytope that
is both tight and cheap to compute. To analyze the theoretical performance of
the proposed LP relaxations, we focus on permutation group synchronization, an
important special case of joint object matching. We show that under the random
corruption model for the input maps, a simple LP relaxation, that is, an LP
containing only a very small fraction of the proposed facet-defining
inequalities, recovers the ground truth with high probability if the corruption
level is below $40\%$. Finally, via a preliminary computational study on
synthetic data, we show that the proposed LP relaxations outperform a popular
SDP relaxation both in terms of recovery and tightness.

semantically related to a given image but also consistent with a given style
description. One of the biggest challenges with this task is the lack of
sufficient paired stylized data. Many studies focus on unsupervised approaches,
without considering from the perspective of data augmentation. We begin with
the observation that people may recall similar emotions when they are in
similar scenes, and often express similar emotions with similar style phrases,
which underpins our data augmentation idea. In this paper, we propose a novel
Extract-Retrieve-Generate data augmentation framework to extract style phrases
from small-scale stylized sentences and graft them to large-scale factual
captions. First, we design the emotional signal extractor to extract style
phrases from small-scale stylized sentences. Second, we construct the plugable
multi-modal scene retriever to retrieve scenes represented with pairs of an
image and its stylized caption, which are similar to the query image or caption
in the large-scale factual data. In the end, based on the style phrases of
similar scenes and the factual description of the current scene, we build the
emotion-aware caption generator to generate fluent and diversified stylized
captions for the current scene. Extensive experimental results show that our
framework can alleviate the data scarcity problem effectively. It also
significantly boosts the performance of several existing image captioning

roughly uniform size, where each off-diagonal tile is compressed and stored as
its own low rank factorization. They offer an attractive representation for
many data-sparse dense operators that appear in practical applications, where
substantial compression and a much smaller memory footprint can be achieved.
TLR matrices are a compromise between the simplicity of a regular
perfectly-strided data structure and the optimal complexity of the unbalanced
trees of hierarchically low rank matrices, and provide a convenient
performance-tuning parameter through their tile size that can be proportioned
to take into account the cache size where the tiles reside in the memory
hierarchy.
  There are currently no high-performance algorithms that can generate Cholesky
and $LDL^T$ factorizations, particularly on GPUs. The difficulties in achieving
high performance when factoring TLR matrices come from the expensive
compression operations that must be performed during the factorization process
and the adaptive rank distribution of the tiles that causes an irregular work
pattern for the processing cores. In this work, we develop a dynamic batching
operation and combine it with batched adaptive randomized approximations to
achieve high performance both on GPUs and CPUs.
  Our implementation attains over 1.2 TFLOP/s in double precision on the V100
GPU, and is limited by the performance of batched GEMM operations. The Cholesky
factorization of covariance matrix of size $N = 131K$ arising in spatial
statistics can be factored to an accuracy $\epsilon=10^{-2}$ in just a few
seconds. We believe the proposed GEMM-centric algorithm allows it to be readily

discovery of top-performer neural networks, but suffers from heavy resource
consumption and often incurs search bias due to truncated training or
approximations. Recent NAS works start to explore indicators that can predict a
network's performance without training. However, they either leveraged limited
properties of deep networks, or the benefits of their training-free indicators
are not applied to more extensive search methods. By rigorous correlation
analysis, we present a unified framework to understand and accelerate NAS, by
disentangling ""TEG"" characteristics of searched networks - Trainability,
Expressivity, Generalization - all assessed in a training-free manner. The TEG
indicators could be scaled up and integrated with various NAS search methods,
including both supernet and single-path approaches. Extensive studies validate
the effective and efficient guidance from our TEG-NAS framework, leading to
both improved search accuracy and over 56% reduction in search time cost.
Moreover, we visualize search trajectories on three landscapes of ""TEG""

defining one dataset as in-distribution (ID) and all others as OOD. However,

e.g., to perfectly distinguish CIFAR dogs from ImageNet dogs, even though they
have the same semantics and negligible covariate shifts. These unrealistic
goals will result in an extremely narrow range of model capabilities, greatly
limiting their use in real applications. To overcome these drawbacks, we
re-design the benchmarks and propose the semantically coherent
out-of-distribution detection (SC-OOD). On the SC-OOD benchmarks, existing
methods suffer from large performance degradation, suggesting that they are
extremely sensitive to low-level discrepancy between data sources while
ignoring their inherent semantics. To develop an effective SC-OOD detection
approach, we leverage an external unlabeled set and design a concise framework
featured by unsupervised dual grouping (UDG) for the joint modeling of ID and
OOD data. The proposed UDG can not only enrich the semantic knowledge of the
model by exploiting unlabeled data in an unsupervised manner, but also
distinguish ID/OOD samples to enhance ID classification and OOD detection tasks

International peace efforts appear increasingly ill-equipped to successfully

performance that is comparable with the state of the art among deterministic
unimodal regression models. Simultaneously, since we have access to the
likelihood of each sample, we demonstrate that our model is useful in a series
of downstream tasks, where we leverage the probabilistic nature of the
prediction as a tool for more accurate estimation. These tasks include
reconstruction from multiple uncalibrated views, as well as human model

problem of Ramsey theory with long and illustrious history. Despite this there

exactly. One such family consists of large vertex disjoint unions of a fixed
graph $H$, we denote such a graph, consisting of $n$ copies of $H$ by $nH$.
This classical result was proved by Burr, Erd\H{o}s and Spencer in 1975, who
showed $r(nH)=(2|H|-\alpha(H))n+c$, for some $c=c(H)$, provided $n$ is large
enough. Since it did not follow from their arguments, Burr, Erd\H{o}s and

amounts of text is crucial for natural language understanding. However, models
trained without predefined notions of topical interest typically require
careful fine-tuning when transferred to specialized domains. When a sufficient
amount of within-domain text may not be available, expanding a seed corpus of
relevant documents from large-scale web data poses several challenges. First,
corpus expansion requires scoring and ranking each document in the collection,
an operation that can quickly become computationally expensive as the web
corpora size grows. Relying on dense vector spaces and pairwise similarity adds
to the computational expense. Secondly, as the domain concept becomes more
nuanced, capturing the long tail of domain-specific rare terms becomes
non-trivial, especially under limited seed corpora scenarios.
  In this paper, we consider the problem of fast approximate corpus expansion
given a small seed corpus with a few relevant documents as a query, with the
goal of capturing the long tail of a domain-specific set of concept terms. To
efficiently collect large-scale domain-specific corpora with limited relevance
feedback, we propose a novel truncated sparse document bit-vector
representation, termed Signature Assisted Unsupervised Corpus Expansion
(SAUCE). Experimental results show that SAUCE can reduce the computational
burden while ensuring high within-domain lexical coverage.

unify the strengths of previous metrics, while mitigating their weaknesses.
Specifically, our new metrics are able to match contextualized substructures

Benchmark for AMR Metrics based on Overt Objectives (BAMBOO), the first
benchmark to support empirical assessment of graph-based MR similarity metrics.
BAMBOO maximizes the interpretability of results by defining multiple overt
objectives that range from sentence similarity objectives to stress tests that
probe a metric's robustness against meaning-altering and meaning-preserving
graph transformations. We show the benefits of BAMBOO by profiling previous
metrics and our own metrics. Results indicate that our novel metrics may serve
as a strong baseline for future work.

column density is in fact $\gtrsim 1.5 \times 10^{24}$cm$^{-2}$, consistent
with the distant scattering matter being Compton-thick. For a fourth AGN, 2 out
of 5 observations are also consistent with being Compton-thick, although with
large errors. Some of these AGNs have been reported to host relativistically
broadened Fe K$\alpha$ emission. Based on our modeling, the Fe K$\alpha$
emission line is not resolved in all but two $Suzaku$ observations, and the
data can be fitted well with models that only include a narrow Fe K$\alpha$
emission line.

is important for video-relevant tasks such as action recognition. Existing
video domain adaptation methods mainly rely on adversarial feature alignment,

associated with multi-modal information, e.g., RGB and optical flow, and thus
it remains a challenge to design a better method that considers the cross-modal
inputs under the cross-domain adaptation setting. To this end, we propose a
unified framework for video domain adaptation, which simultaneously regularizes
cross-modal and cross-domain feature representations. Specifically, we treat
each modality in a domain as a view and leverage the contrastive learning
technique with properly designed sampling strategies. As a result, our
objectives regularize feature spaces, which originally lack the connection
across modalities or have less alignment across domains. We conduct experiments
on domain adaptive action recognition benchmark datasets, i.e., UCF, HMDB, and
EPIC-Kitchens, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our components against

Additionally, we introduce the use of phonation, articulation and prosody

inputs that enable a robot to reach a goal region while safely avoiding
obstacles. However, in many situations, the state of the system may not be
known but only estimated using, for instance, a Kalman filter. This results in
a novel motion planning problem where safety must be ensured in the presence of
state estimation uncertainty. Previous approaches to this problem are either
conservative or integrate state estimates optimistically which leads to
non-robust solutions. Optimistic solutions require frequent replanning to not
endanger the safety of the system. We propose a new formulation to this problem
with the aim to be robust to state estimation errors while not being overly
conservative. In particular, we formulate a stochastic optimal control problem
that contains robustified risk-aware safety constraints by incorporating
robustness margins to account for state estimation errors. We propose a novel
sampling-based approach that builds trees exploring the reachable space of
Gaussian distributions that capture uncertainty both in state estimation and in
future measurements. We provide robustness guarantees and show, both in theory
and simulations, that the induced robustness margins constitute a trade-off
between conservatism and robustness for planning under estimation uncertainty
that allows to control the frequency of replanning.

paper are as follows. First, we present a new characterization result for the
stochastic processes of class $(\Sigma^{r})$. More precisely, we extend a known
characterization result that Nikeghbali established for the non-negative
sub-martingales of class $(\Sigma)$, whose finite variational part is
continuous (see Theorem 2.4 of \cite{nik}). Second, we provide a framework for
unifying the studies of classes $(\Sigma)$ and $(\Sigma^{r})$. More precisely,
we define and study a new larger class that we call class $(\Sigma^{g})$. In
particular, we establish two characterization results for the stochastic
processes of the said class. The first one characterizes all the elements of
class $(\Sigma^{g})$. Hence, we derive two corollaries based on this result,
which provides new ways to characterize classes $(\Sigma)$ and $(\Sigma^{r})$.
The second characterization result is, at the same time, an extension of the
above mentioned characterization result for class $(\Sigma^{r})$ and of a known
characterization result of class $(\Sigma)$ (see Theorem 2 of \cite{fjo}). In
addition, we explore and extend the general properties obtained for classes

transparent proof for the module type $(1,n)\, (n\geq 2)$ of Leavitt algebra
$L_K(1, n)\, (n\geq 2)$, and the fact that Leavitt path algebras of finite

sentence similarity using cosine similarity score. We suggest this score as an
indicator of sequential events' level of coherence. We finally sort the

of observations with frequency one. We first investigate the induced random
partition, the associated predictive distribution and we characterize the
asymptotic behaviour of the number of clusters. All the results we obtain are
in closed form and easily interpretable, as a noteworthy example we focus on
the contaminated version of the Pitman-Yor process. Finally we pinpoint the
advantage of our construction in different applied problems: we show how the

clustering problem and to improve predictive inference in a species-related

mitigating adversarial attacks, the behavioral differences between
adversarially-trained (AT) models and standard models are still poorly
understood. Motivated by a recent study on learning robustness without input
perturbations by distilling an AT model, we explore what is learned during
adversarial training by analyzing the distribution of logits in AT models. We
identify three logit characteristics essential to learning adversarial
robustness. First, we provide a theoretical justification for the finding that
adversarial training shrinks two important characteristics of the logit
distribution: the max logit values and the ""logit gaps"" (difference between the
logit max and next largest values) are on average lower for AT models. Second,
we show that AT and standard models differ significantly on which samples are
high or low confidence, then illustrate clear qualitative differences by
visualizing samples with the largest confidence difference. Finally, we find
learning information about incorrect classes to be essential to learning
robustness by manipulating the non-max logit information during distillation
and measuring the impact on the student's robustness. Our results indicate that
learning some adversarial robustness without input perturbations requires a
model to learn specific sample-wise confidences and incorrect class orderings

bulk lubricant infusion in the soft substrate is a potential pathway for
overcoming this limitation. We demonstrate that even 5% bulk lubricant infusion
in PDMS reduces viscoelastic dissipation in the substrate by more than 30 times

nucleation and growth rate with the material properties controlled by design,
i.e. the fraction and composition of uncrosslinked chains, shear modulus, and
viscoelastic dissipation. Through in-situ, microscale condensation on the

pre-coalescence droplet growth rate is insensitive to the percentage of
lubricant in PDMS. Our results indicate the presence of a lubricant layer on
the substrate surface that cloaks the growing condensate droplets. We visualize
the cloaking effect and show that lubricant infusion in PDMS significantly

number of parameters increases. Recently, it has also been shown that an
`epochwise double descent' effect exists in which the generalization error
initially drops, then rises, and finally drops again with increasing training
time. This presents a practical problem in that the amount of time required for
training is long, and early stopping based on validation performance may result
in suboptimal generalization. In this work we develop an analytically tractable
model of epochwise double descent that allows us to characterise theoretically
when this effect is likely to occur. This model is based on the hypothesis that
the training data contains features that are slow to learn but informative. We
then show experimentally that deep neural networks behave similarly to our
theoretical model. Our findings indicate that epochwise double descent requires
a critical amount of noise to occur, but above a second critical noise level
early stopping remains effective. Using insights from theory, we give two
methods by which epochwise double descent can be removed: one that removes slow
to learn features from the input and reduces generalization performance, and
another that instead modifies the training dynamics and matches or exceeds the
generalization performance of standard training. Taken together, our results
suggest a new picture of how epochwise double descent emerges from the
interplay between the dynamics of training and noise in the training data.

and coherent control of excitonic states of trapped neutral atoms. On quenching
the system from the topological to the gapless phases and then back again, we
find that interference patterns develop in the gapless phase and also after
switching back to the topological phase. These patterns occur both as
many-excitation interferences generated in the presence of pumping the atoms at

nature of the initial states and are very different from quantum interferences
originating from non-topological states of the lattice. Our results also reveal
that unlike well-known situations where topological states are protected
against local perturbations, in the non-Hermitian SSH systems resulting from
driving the excited state populations, a local dissipation at each lattice site

prediction of the combined effect of these flood hazards are critical. To
address this need, this study presents a modeling system for assessing the
combined flood risk to coastal cities under changing climate conditions that
leverages ocean modeling with land surface modeling capable of resolving urban
drainage infrastructure within the city. The modeling approach is demonstrated
in quantifying the future impact on transportation infrastructure within
Norfolk, Virginia USA. A series of combined storms events are modeled for
current (2020) and projected future (2070) climate conditions. Results show
that pluvial flooding causes a larger interruption to the transportation
network compared to tidal flooding under current climate conditions. By 2070,
however, tidal flooding will be the dominant flooding mechanism with even
nuisance flooding expected to happen daily due to SLR. In 2070, nuisance
flooding is expected to cause a 4.6% total link close time (TLC), which is more
than two times that of a 50-year storm surge (1.8% TLC) in 2020. The coupled
model was compared with a widely used but physically simplistic bathtub method
to assess the difference resulting from the more complex modeling presented.
Results show that the bathtub method overestimated the flooded area near the
shoreline by 9.5% and 3.1% for a 10-year storm surge event in 2020 and 2070,
respectively, but underestimated flooded area in the inland region by 9.0% and
4.0% for the same events. The findings demonstrate the benefit of sophisticated
modeling methods in climate adaptive planning and policy in coastal

slicing in dynamic vehicular communications still faces many challenges,
particularly time-varying traffic of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) services and the

slices for diverse V2V services. With only the long-term and partial
information of vehicular networks, eNodeB (eNB) can infer the underlying
network situation and then intelligently adjust the configuration for each
slice to ensure the long-term QoS performance. Under the coordination of eNB,
each vehicle can autonomously select radio resources for its V2V transmission
in a decentralized manner. Specifically, the slicing control at the eNB is
realized by a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, which is
a convergence of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and actor-critic DRL. Compared
to the existing DRL algorithms, the proposed DRL neither requires any prior
knowledge nor assumes any statistical model of vehicular networks. Furthermore,
simulation results show the effectiveness of our proposed intelligent network

$L_p$ samplers in turnstile streams, where $G(x)=|x|^p$, using
$\text{polylog}(n)$ space for $p\in(0,2]$. However, to date all known sampling
algorithms are not truly perfect, since their output distribution is only
point-wise $\gamma = 1/\text{poly}(n)$ close to the true distribution. This
small error can be significant when samplers are run many times on successive
portions of a stream, and leak potentially sensitive information about the data
stream. In this work, we initiate the study of truly perfect samplers, with
$\epsilon = \gamma = 0$, and comprehensively investigate their complexity in

two-fold evaluation was carried out. On the one side, an n-gram overlapping
evaluation using the BLEU score. On the other side, a semantic-based assessment
using BERTScore and NUBIA. The results were corroborated by a binary human

glasses (MGs). The present understanding of how a small amount of alloying
element changes strength is that the additions lead to more efficient packing
of atoms and increased local topological order, which then increases the
barrier for shear transformations and the resistance to plastic deformation.
Here, we discover that minor alloying can improve the strength of MGs by
increasing the chemical bond strength alone and show that this strengthening is
distinct from changes in topological order. The results were obtained using
Al-Sm based MGs minor alloyed with transition metals (TMs). The addition of TMs
led to an increase in the hardness of the MGs which, however, could not be
explained based on changes in the topological ordering in the structure.
Instead we found that it was the strong bonding between TM and Al atoms which
led to a higher resistance to shear transformation that resulted in higher
strength and hardness, while the topology around the TM atoms had no influence
on their mechanical response. This finding demonstrates that the effects of
topology and chemistry on mechanical properties of MGs are independent of each
other and that they should be understood as separate, sometimes competing
mechanisms of strengthening. This understanding lays a foundation for design of
MGs with improved mechanical properties.

with both forward wave propagation and FWIs case studies. These synthetic case
studies are designed to explore the ability of PINNs to handle varying degrees
of structural complexity using both teleseismic plane waves and seismic point

wave equation and different types of boundary conditions. For instance, our
models demonstrate that PINN automatically satisfies absorbing boundary

solvers. Furthermore, a priori knowledge of the subsurface structure can be
seamlessly encoded in PINNs formulation. We find that the current
state-of-the-art PINNs provide good results for the forward model, even though
spectral element or finite difference methods are more efficient and accurate.
More importantly, our results demonstrate that PINNs yield excellent results
for inversions on all cases considered and with limited computational
complexity. Using PINNs as a geophysical inversion solver offers exciting
perspectives, not only for the full waveform seismic inversions, but also when
dealing with other geophysical datasets (e.g., magnetotellurics, gravity) as

generally thought to involve a fluid magnetic dynamo effect driven by helical

grounds, it however currently remains largely unconstrained, notably because a
fundamental understanding of the nonlinear asymptotic behaviour of large-scale
fluid magnetism in the astrophysically-relevant but treacherous regime of large

local high-resolution simulations of turbulent magnetohydrodynamics driven by
an inhomogeneous helical forcing generating a sinusoidal profile of kinetic

rotating turbulent fluid bodies. We identify a transition at large $Rm$ to a
nonlinear state, followed up to $Rm\simeq 3\times 10^3$, consisting of strong,
saturated small-scale magnetohydrodynamic turbulence and a weaker, travelling
coherent large-scale field oscillation. This state is characterized by an
asymptotically small resistive dissipation of magnetic helicity, by its spatial
redistribution across the equator through turbulent fluxes driven by the
hemispheric distribution of kinetic helicity, and by the tentative presence in
the tangled dynamical magnetic field of plasmoids typical of reconnection at
large $Rm$.

makes manual rigging infeasible. However, object animations involve
understanding elaborate geometry and dynamics, and such knowledge is hard to
infuse even with modern data-driven techniques. Automatic rigging methods do
not provide adequate control and cannot generalize in the presence of unseen

transfer it to other objects. In previous work, this has been implemented by
solving the dense point-to-point correspondence problem. Such an approach
requires a significant amount of supervision, often placing hundreds of
landmarks by hand. This paper proposes a functional approach for skeleton
transfer that uses limited information and does not require a complete match
between the geometries. To do so, we suggest a novel representation for the
skeleton properties, namely the functional regressor, which is compact and
invariant to different discretizations and poses. We consider our functional
regressor a new operator to adopt in intrinsic geometry pipelines for encoding
the pose information, paving the way for several new applications. We
numerically stress our method on a large set of different shapes and object

hyperparameters for individual families of priors are often discussed in the
literature, but rarely are different families of priors compared under similar
models and hyperparameters. Using simulated data, we evaluate the performance
of inverse gamma and half-$t$ priors for estimating the standard deviation of
random effects in three hierarchical models: the 8-schools model, a random
intercepts longitudinal model, and a simple multiple outcomes model. We compare
the performance of the two prior families using a range of prior
hyperparameters, some of which have been suggested in the literature, and
others that allow for a direct comparison of pairs of half-$t$ and
inverse-gamma priors. Estimation of very small values of the random effect
standard deviation led to convergence issues especially for the half-$t$
priors. For most settings, we found that the posterior distribution of the
standard deviation had smaller bias under half-$t$ priors than under their
inverse-gamma counterparts. Inverse gamma priors generally gave similar
coverage but had smaller interval lengths than their half-$t$ prior
counterparts. Our results for these two prior families will inform prior
specification for hierarchical models, allowing practitioners to better align
their priors with their respective models and goals.

constrain models of the metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium. The
targets were selected from X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect surveys,
and observed with both the \textit{XMM-Newton} and \textit{Chandra} satellites.
For each cluster, a precise gas mass profile was extracted, from which the
value of $r_{500}$ could be estimated. This allows us to define consistent
radial ranges over which the metallicity measurements can be compared. In
general, the data are of sufficient quality to extract meaningful metallicity
measurements in two radial bins, $r<0.3r_{500}$ and $0.3<r/r_{500}<1.0$. For
the outer bin, the combined measurement for all ten clusters, $Z/Z_{\odot} =
0.21 \pm 0.09$, represents a substantial improvement in precision over previous
results. This measurement is consistent with, but slightly lower than, the
average metallicity of 0.315 Solar measured at intermediate-to-large radii in
low-redshift clusters. Combining our new high-redshift data with the previous
low-redshift results allows us to place the tightest constraints to date on
models of the evolution of cluster metallicity at intermediate radii. Adopting
a power law model of the form $Z \propto \left(1+z\right)^\gamma$, we measure a
slope $\gamma = -0.5^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$, consistent with the majority of the

learning, they mainly focus on i.i.d data, which cannot be directly applied to
explain the predictions of GNNs because GNNs utilize both node features and
graph topology to make predictions. There are only very few work on the
explainability of GNNs and they focus on post-hoc explanations. Since post-hoc
explanations are not directly obtained from the GNNs, they can be biased and
misrepresent the true explanations. Therefore, in this paper, we study a novel
problem of self-explainable GNNs which can simultaneously give predictions and
explanations. We propose a new framework which can find $K$-nearest labeled
nodes for each unlabeled node to give explainable node classification, where
nearest labeled nodes are found by interpretable similarity module in terms of
both node similarity and local structure similarity. Extensive experiments on
real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework for explainable node classification.

prediction and control. Tomorrow's machines may be closer to biological systems
in their mutability, resilience, and autonomy. But first they must be capable
of learning and retaining new information without being exposed to it
arbitrarily often. Past efforts to engineer such systems have sought to build
or regulate artificial neural networks using disjoint sets of weights that are
uniquely sensitive to specific tasks or inputs. This has not yet enabled
continual learning over long sequences of previously unseen data without
corrupting existing knowledge: a problem known as catastrophic forgetting. In
this paper, we introduce a system that can learn sequentially over previously
unseen datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-100) with little forgetting over time. This is
done by controlling the activity of weights in a convolutional neural network
on the basis of inputs using top-down regulation generated by a second
feed-forward neural network. We find that our method learns continually under
domain transfer with sparse bursts of activity in weights that are recycled
across tasks, rather than by maintaining task-specific modules. Sparse synaptic
bursting is found to balance activity and suppression such that new functions
can be learned without corrupting extant knowledge, thus mirroring the balance
of order and disorder in systems at the edge of chaos. This behavior emerges
during a prior pre-training (or 'meta-learning') phase in which regulated
synapses are selectively disinhibited, or grown, from an initial state of
uniform suppression through prediction error minimization.

approximation (TA) signals based on turbulent zero crossings, where the
interval between crossings is governed by a power law probability distribution
with exponent $\alpha$. The power law exponent is determined for statistics of
simulated TA signals, namely the box-counting fractal dimension $D_1$, energy
spectrum exponent $\beta_{TA}$, and an intermittency exponent $\mu_{TA}$. For
the binary TA signal with no variability in amplitude, the parameters are
related linearly as $D_1 = 2 - \beta_{TA} = 1 - \mu_{TA}$. The relations are
unchanged if the crossing interval distribution has a finite power law region
(i.e. inertial subrange) representing a flow with finite Reynolds number.
However, the finite distribution yields statistics that are not truly
scale-invariant, and distorts the linear relation between the statistic
exponents and $\alpha$. The behavior is due to finite-size effects apparent
from the survival function, or the complementary cumulative distribution, which
for finite Reynolds number is only approximately self-similar and has an
effective exponent differing from $\alpha$. An expression presented for the
effective exponent recovers the expected relations between $\alpha$ and the TA
statistics. The findings demonstrate how a finite Reynolds number can affect
indicators of self-similarity, fractality, and intermittency observed from
single-point measurements.

family of random distance functions $\{D_h^\epsilon\}_{\epsilon >0}$ on the

$\{h_\epsilon\}_{\epsilon >0}$ is a smooth mollification of the planar Gaussian
free field. Recent works have shown that for all $\xi > 0$ the LFPP metrics,
appropriately re-scaled, admit non-trivial subsequential limiting metrics. In
the case when $\xi < \xi_{\mathrm{crit}} \approx 0.41$, it has been shown that
the subsequential limit is unique and defines a metric on $\gamma$-Liouville
quantum gravity $\gamma = \gamma(\xi) \in (0,2)$.
  We prove that for all $\xi > 0$, each possible subsequential limiting metric
is nearly bi-Lipschitz equivalent to the LFPP metric $D_h^\epsilon$ when
$\epsilon$ is small, even if $\epsilon$ does not belong to the appropriate
subsequence. Using this result, we obtain bounds for the scaling constants for
LFPP which are sharp up to polylogarithmic factors. We also prove that any two
subsequential limiting metrics are bi-Lipschitz equivalent.
  Our results are an input in subsequent work which shows that the
subsequential limits of LFPP induce the same topology as the Euclidean metric
when $\xi = \xi_{\mathrm{crit}}$. We expect that our results will also have
several other uses, e.g., in the proof that the subsequential limit is unique

automatically repair them unless the leak causes a functional test to fail. We
present our vision for HyperGI, a genetic improvement framework tha detects,
localizes and repairs information leakage. Key elements of HyperGI include (1)
the use of two orthogonal test suites, (2) a dynamic leak detection approach

successful use of HyperGI on several programs which have no failing functional

harmonic potential outside the Earth when the intensity of the related field is
measured on the Earth's surface. Thus, the boundary condition is (severely)
nonlinear. The gravitational case is quite understood. It consists in the local
resolution near a monopole, i.e. the potential generated by a point mass. In
this paper, we consider the geomagnetic case. This consists in linearizing the
field's intensity near the so-called dipole, a harmonic function which models
the solenoidal potential of a magnet. The problem is quite difficult, because
the resolving operator related to the linearized problem is generally
unbounded. Indeed, existence results for Backus's problem in this framework are
not present in the literature. In this work, we locally solve the geomagnetic
version of Backus's problem in the axially symmetric case. In mathematical
terms, we show the existence of harmonic functions in the exterior of a sphere,
with given (boundary) field's intensity sufficiently close to that of a dipole
and which have the same axial symmetry of a dipole. We also show that unique
solutions can be selected by prescribing the average of the potential on the
equatorial circle of the sphere. We obtain those solutions as series of
spherical harmonics. The functional framework entails the use of fractional
Sobolev Hilbert spaces on the sphere, endowed with a spectral norm. A crucial
ingredient is the algebra structure of suitable subspaces.

dependencies. Known vulnerabilities in these dependencies are a potential
security risk. Software composition analysis (SCA) tools, therefore, are being
increasingly adopted by practitioners to keep track of vulnerable dependencies.
Aim: The goal of this study is to understand the difference in vulnerability
reporting by various SCA tools. Understanding if and how existing SCA tools
differ in their analysis may help security practitioners to choose the right
tooling and identify future research needs. Method: We present an in-depth case
study by comparing the analysis reports of 9 industry-leading SCA tools on a
large web application, OpenMRS, composed of Maven (Java) and npm (JavaScript)
projects. Results: We find that the tools vary in their vulnerability
reporting. The count of reported vulnerable dependencies ranges from 17 to 332
for Maven and from 32 to 239 for npm projects across the studied tools.
Similarly, the count of unique known vulnerabilities reported by the tools
ranges from 36 to 313 for Maven and from 45 to 234 for npm projects. Our manual
analysis of the tools' results suggest that accuracy of the vulnerability
database is a key differentiator for SCA tools. Conclusion: We recommend that
practitioners should not rely on any single tool at the present, as that can
result in missing known vulnerabilities. We point out two research directions
in the SCA space: i) establishing frameworks and metrics to identify false
positives for dependency vulnerabilities; and ii) building automation
technologies for continuous monitoring of vulnerability data from open source
package ecosystems.

array in a 2D stress wave scattering setup, and a corresponding sensing
application of this system is proposed to achieve source angle localization.
The phononic domain consists of a periodic micro-structured medium, of which
the eigen-wavevector band structure and the eigen-modes are exploited. The
eigen-modes are naturally angle dependent due to changes in phases and periodic
mode shapes determined by the incident angle. Intriguingly, the band exhibits
angle-dependent transitions at the exceptional points (EPs) and critical angles
(CAs), where the eigenvalues coincide or vanish. Coupled with these
transitions, it is found that the eigen-modes switch their energy
characteristics and symmetry patterns at these branch points, leading to
enhanced angle dependence. Moreover, these eigen-modes also serve as the basis
functions of the scattered waves. Therefore, the scattering response of the
medium inherently possesses the angle-dependent properties, making this system
naturally suitable for sensing applications. An artificial neural network (ANN)
is trained with randomly weighted eigen-modes to achieve deep learning of the
eigen features and angle dependence. The training data is derived only based on
the eigen-modes of the unit cells. Nevertheless, the trained ANN can accurately
identify the incident angle of an unknown scattering signal, with minimal side
lobe levels and suppressed main lobe width. The ANN shows superior performance
in comparison with standard delay-and-sum technique of estimating angle of
arrival. The proposed application of ANN and micro-structured media highlights
the physical importance of band structure topology and eigen-modes to a
technological application, adds extra strength to the existing localization
methods, and can be easily enhanced with the fast-growing data-driven
techniques.

  Estimation","The paper is accepted by IEEE Control System Letter (L-CSS)",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work proposes an algorithmic method to verify differential privacy for
estimation mechanisms with performance guarantees. Differential privacy makes
it hard to distinguish outputs of a mechanism produced by adjacent inputs.
While obtaining theoretical conditions that guarantee differential privacy may
be possible, evaluating these conditions in practice can be hard. This is
especially true for estimation mechanisms that take values in continuous
spaces, as this requires checking for an infinite set of inequalities. Instead,
our verification approach consists of testing the differential privacy
condition for a suitably chosen finite collection of events at the expense of
some information loss. More precisely, our data-driven, test framework for
continuous range mechanisms first finds a highly-likely, compact event set, as
well as a partition of this event, and then evaluates differential privacy wrt
this partition. This results into a type of differential privacy with high
confidence, which we are able to quantify precisely. This approach is then used
to evaluate the differential-privacy properties of the recently proposed $W_2$
Moving Horizon Estimator. We confirm its properties, while comparing its
performance with alternative approaches in simulation.

are directly employed for the reformulated model to arrive at a new kind of

implement the proposed methods effectively, we present a very efficient

agents to solve decision problems in a verifiable manner. The PVG consists of
two learners with competing objectives: a trusted verifier network tries to
choose the correct answer, and a more powerful but untrusted prover network
attempts to persuade the verifier of a particular answer, regardless of its

have the desired equilibria. We develop instantiations of the PVG for two
algorithmic tasks, and show that in practice, the verifier learns a robust
decision rule that is able to receive useful and reliable information from an
untrusted prover. Importantly, the protocol still works even when the verifier
is frozen and the prover's messages are directly optimized to convince the

massive-scale user population. In recent years, promotion with quantifiable
incentive has become a popular approach for increasing active users on such
platforms. On one hand, increased user activities can introduce network effect,
bring in advertisement audience, and produce other benefits. On the other hand,
massive-scale promotion causes massive cost. Therefore making promotion
campaigns efficient in terms of return-on-investment (ROI) is of great interest
to many companies.
  This paper proposes a practical two-stage framework that can optimize the ROI
of various massive-scale promotion campaigns. In the first stage, users'
personal promotion-response curves are modeled by machine learning techniques.
In the second stage, business objectives and resource constraints are
formulated into an optimization problem, the decision variables of which are
how much incentive to give to each user. In order to do effective optimization
in the second stage, counterfactual prediction and noise-reduction are
essential for the first stage. We leverage existing counterfactual prediction
techniques to correct treatment bias in data. We also introduce a novel deep
neural network (DNN) architecture, the deep-isotonic-promotion-network (DIPN),
to reduce noise in the promotion response curves. The DIPN architecture
incorporates our prior knowledge of response curve shape, by enforcing
isotonicity and smoothness. It out-performed regular DNN and other
state-of-the-art shape-constrained models in our experiments.

inspiration from biological vision systems that allocate more foveal ""pixels""
to salient parts of the scene. We introduce FOVEA, an approach for intelligent
downsampling that ensures salient image regions remain ""magnified"" in the
downsampled output. Given a high-res image, FOVEA applies a differentiable
resampling layer that outputs a small fixed-size image canvas, which is then
processed with a differentiable vision module (e.g., object detection network),
whose output is then differentiably backward mapped onto the original image
size. The key idea is to resample such that background pixels can make room for
salient pixels of interest. In order to ensure the overall pipeline remains
efficient, FOVEA makes use of cheap and readily available cues for saliency,
including dataset-specific spatial priors or temporal priors computed from
object predictions in the recent past. On the autonomous driving datasets
Argoverse-HD and BDD100K, our proposed method boosts the detection AP over
standard Faster R-CNN, both with and without finetuning. Without any noticeable

datasets with abundant labeled data (i.e., the base set). From the perspective
of class space on base set, existing methods either focus on utilizing all
classes under a global view by normal pretraining, or pay more attention to
adopt an episodic manner to train meta-tasks within few classes in a local
view. However, the interaction of the two views is rarely explored. As the two
views capture complementary information, we naturally think of the
compatibility of them for achieving further performance gains. Inspired by the
mutual learning paradigm and binocular parallax, we propose a unified
framework, namely Binocular Mutual Learning (BML), which achieves the
compatibility of the global view and the local view through both intra-view and
cross-view modeling. Concretely, the global view learns in the whole class
space to capture rich inter-class relationships. Meanwhile, the local view
learns in the local class space within each episode, focusing on matching
positive pairs correctly. In addition, cross-view mutual interaction further
promotes the collaborative learning and the implicit exploration of useful
knowledge from each other. During meta-test, binocular embeddings are
aggregated together to support decision-making, which greatly improve the
accuracy of classification. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple
benchmarks including cross-domain validation confirm the effectiveness of our
method.

Unlike plain neural text generation tasks, poetry has a high requirement for

present Lingxi, a diversity-aware Chinese modern poetry generation system. We

randomizes the high frequency part (""head"") of the predicted distribution, in

with traditional sampling methods. The permutation of distribution is
controllable by tuning the filtering parameter that determines the ""head"" to
permutate, achieving diversity-aware sampling. We find that even when a large

performance comparable to the pooled analysis where individual-level data are

  Recognition","27 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This study investigates an application of a new probabilistic interpretation
of a softmax output to Open-Set Recognition (OSR). Softmax is a mechanism
wildly used in classification and object recognition.
  However, a softmax mechanism forces a model to operate under a closed-set
paradigm, i.e., to predict an object class out of a set of pre-defined labels.
  This characteristic contributes to efficacy in classification, but poses a
risk of non-sense prediction in object recognition.
  Object recognition is often operated under a dynamic and diverse condition.
  A foreign object -- an object of any unprepared class -- can be encountered
at any time.
  OSR is intended to address an issue of identifying a foreign object in object
recognition.
  Based on Bayes theorem and the emphasis of conditioning on the context,
softmax inference has been re-interpreted.
  This re-interpretation has led to a new approach to OSR, called Latent
Cognizance (LC). Our investigation employs various scenarios, using Imagenet
2012 dataset as well as fooling and open-set images. The findings support LC
hypothesis and show its effectiveness on OSR.

of near-field TPV energy conversion in the far-to-near-field transition regime

idea is to preserve the semantic information instead of strictly securing the
bit-level precision. Unlike previous methods that mainly concentrate on the

semantic blindness of commonly used objective functions. To address this
semantic gap, we introduce a schematic shift that learns from semantic
similarity, instead of relying on conventional paired bit-level supervisions
like cross entropy and bit error rate. However, developing such a semantic
communication system is indeed a nontrivial task considering the
non-differentiability of most semantic metrics as well as the instability from
noisy channels. To further resolve these issues, we put forward a self-critic
reinforcement learning (RL) solution which allows an efficient and stable
learning on any user-defined semantic measurement, and take a step further to
simultaneously tackle the non-differentiable semantic channel optimization
problem via self-critic stochastic iterative updating (SCSIU) training on the
decoupled semantic transceiver. We have firstly tested the proposed method in
the challenging European-parliament dataset, which confirms the superiority of
our method in revealing the semantic meanings, and better handling the semantic
noise. Apart from the experimental results, we further provide an in-depth look
at how the semantic model behaves, along with its superb generalization ability
in real-life examples. An RL-based image transmission extension is also
exemplified, so as to prove the generalization ability and motivate future

their output power dynamics depend on complex system interactions,

systems, comprising a control modeling approach and model predictive control
(MPC) strategy. This methodology is demonstrated on the high-pressure side of a
simple supercritical CO2 cycle power block, composed of a variable-speed
compressor, heat exchanger, and fixed-speed turbine. The control model is
developed by applying timescale-separation arguments to a high-fidelity
simulation model and locally linearizing non-ideal-gas turbomachinery
performance maps. MPC is implemented by linearizing the control model online at
each sampling instant. Closed-loop simulations with a full-order gas-dynamics
truth model demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control methodology.
In response to load changes, the controller maintains high turbine inlet
temperatures while achieving net power output ramp rates in excess of 100% of
nameplate output per minute. The controller often acts at the intersection of
motor torque, compressor surge, and turbine inlet temperature constraints, and
performs well from 35 to 105% of nameplate capacity with no parameter
scheduling. Good performance and fast update rates are obtained via online
linearization. The results demonstrate the suitability of MPC for the
supercritical CO2 cycle, and the proposed methodology is extensible to more

indicates that the particle number 30 is a magic particle number, where two and
four neutron single-particles are considered to be promoted to the intruder
$1g_{9/2}$ shell. However, the SD-yrast band in $^{62}$Zn is assigned negative
parity. Purpose: I investigate various SD configurations in the rapidly
rotating $^{60,62}$Zn and $^{64}$Ge, and attempt elucidating the different
roles of the energy gaps at particle numbers 30 and 32. Method: I employ a
nuclear energy-density functional (EDF) method: the configuration-constrained
cranked Skyrme-Kohn-Sham approach is used to describe the rotational bands near
the yrast line. Results: The negative-parity SD bands appear higher in energy
than the positive-parity SD-yrast band in $^{60}$Zn by about 4 MeV, which is
indicative of the SD doubly-magic nucleus. However, the energy gap in $^{64}$Ge
is smaller $\sim 2\text{-}3$ MeV, though the quadrupole deformation of the SD
states in $^{64}$Ge is greater than that of $^{60}$Zn. The present calculation
predicts the occurrence of the hyperdeformed state in $^{60}$Zn and $^{64}$Ge
at a high rotational frequency $\sim 2.0$ MeV$/\hbar$ due to the occupation of
the $h_{11/2}$ shell. Conclusions: An SD-shell gap at particle number 30 and 32
appears at different deformations and the energy gap at particle number 32 is
low, which make the SD structures of $^{62}$Zn unique, where the
negative-parity SD states appear lower in energy than the positive-parity one.

mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2) from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2).
This is especially true for surfaces with reflectance close to a critical value
where there is very low sensitivity to aerosol loading. A spectral sorting
approach was introduced to improve the characterization of aerosols over
coastal regions. Here, we generalize this procedure to land surfaces and use a
two-step neural network to retrieve aerosol parameters from OCO-2 measurements.
We show that, by using a combination of radiance measurements in the continuum
and inside the absorption band, both the aerosol optical depth and layer
height, as well as their uncertainties, can be accurately predicted. Using the
improved aerosol estimates as a priori, we demonstrate that the accuracy of the
XCO2 retrieval can be significantly improved compared to the OCO-2 Level-2
Standard product. Furthermore, using simulated observations, we obtain
estimates of the error in the retrieved XCO2. These simulations indicate that
the bias-corrected OCO-2 Lite data, which is used for flux inversions, may have
remaining biases due to misinterpretation of aerosol effects.

Motivated by recent advancements, the study aims to detect important

from them. Further, passing on the latent state information to WAD agents based
on TD3 and SAC methods to learn the optimal driving policy. Our novel approach
utilizing fewer resources, step-by-step learning of different driving tasks,
hard episode termination policy, and reward mechanism has led our agents to
achieve a 100% success rate on all driving tasks in the original CARLA

description, the key goal of which lies in photo realism and semantic
consistency. Previous methods usually generate an initial image with sentence
embedding and then refine it with fine-grained word embedding. Despite the
significant progress, the 'aspect' information (e.g., red eyes) contained in
the text, referring to several words rather than a word that depicts 'a
particular part or feature of something', is often ignored, which is highly
helpful for synthesizing image details. How to make better utilization of
aspect information in text-to-image synthesis still remains an unresolved
challenge. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a Dynamic
Aspect-awarE GAN (DAE-GAN) that represents text information comprehensively
from multiple granularities, including sentence-level, word-level, and
aspect-level. Moreover, inspired by human learning behaviors, we develop a
novel Aspect-aware Dynamic Re-drawer (ADR) for image refinement, in which an
Attended Global Refinement (AGR) module and an Aspect-aware Local Refinement
(ALR) module are alternately employed. AGR utilizes word-level embedding to
globally enhance the previously generated image, while ALR dynamically employs
aspect-level embedding to refine image details from a local perspective.
Finally, a corresponding matching loss function is designed to ensure the
text-image semantic consistency at different levels. Extensive experiments on
two well-studied and publicly available datasets (i.e., CUB-200 and COCO)
demonstrate the superiority and rationality of our method.

with S we will achieve not only an upshift of the conduction-band minimum as
done by employing Ga grading, but also a downshift of the valence-band maximum.
Several existing studies stipulate that S is very often inserted in too high
concentrations into Cu(In,Ga)Se$_2$ absorber by sulphurization resulting in a
deteriorated device performance instead of the expected beneficial effect.
However, we demonstrate here that the intense sulphurization process when
accompanied by Ga-grading leads to improved electrical properties of the
buffer/absorber heterojunction. More exactly, this double grading at the
absorber surface leads to strong reduction of the p-doping and hence to a
change in the band diagram. This work also proves that the intense
sulphurization process is accompanied by strong structural and chemical
changes, i.e., by the formation of a S-rich CuIn(S,Se)$_2$ compound at the
absorber surface. Finally, all these experimental findings were complemented by
ab-initio calculations of the conduction-band and valence-band offsets between

equilibrium point is shown to be globally asymptotically stable for $R_0 < 1$.
When $R_0$ exceeds unity, a unique infected equilibrium exists, and the system
is found to undergo a forward (trans-critical) bifurcation at $R_0=1$. Two
parameter heat plots are also done to find the parameter combinations for which
the equilibrium points are stable. The parameters $\beta, \pi$ and $\Lambda$

  Features for Underwater Acoustic and Optical Images",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the field of underwater vision research, image matching between the sonar
sensors and optical cameras has always been a challenging problem. Due to the
difference in the imaging mechanism between them, which are the gray value,
texture, contrast, etc. of the acoustic images and the optical images are also
variant in local locations, which makes the traditional matching method based
on the optical image invalid. Coupled with the difficulties and high costs of
underwater data acquisition, it further affects the research process of
acousto-optic data fusion technology. In order to maximize the use of
underwater sensor data and promote the development of multi-sensor information
fusion (MSIF), this study applies the image attribute transfer method based on
deep learning approach to solve the problem of acousto-optic image matching,
the core of which is to eliminate the imaging differences between them as much
as possible. At the same time, the advanced local feature descriptor is
introduced to solve the challenging acousto-optic matching problem.
Experimental results show that our proposed method could preprocess
acousto-optic images effectively and obtain accurate matching results.
Additionally, the method is based on the combination of image depth semantic
layer, and it could indirectly display the local feature matching relationship
between original image pair, which provides a new solution to the underwater
multi-sensor image matching problem.

Most recent works use \textit{global features} for feature extraction to
summarize image content. However, global features are not robust against
lighting and viewpoint changes and do not describe the image's geometrical
information to be fully utilized in the manufacturing industry. To the best of

energy, in contrast to RFS likelihood as anomaly score. The similarity
distribution of point pattern features of the normal sample has been modeled as
a multivariate Gaussian. Parameters learning of the proposed RFS energy does

and recursive algebraic operations in TT-format decomposition. Moreover,
existing results established for the tensors of other formats, for example,
Tucker and CP, are inapplicable because the algorithms treating TT-format

provide, to our best knowledge, the first theoretical guarantees of the
convergence of RGrad algorithm for TT-format tensor completion, under a nearly

constant contraction rate that is free of tensor condition number without the

caloric material and its heat transfer capabilities. The caloric device can
cool the electronic component below room temperature at heat-flux densities of

sinks and water-cooled heat sinks, respectively. Caloric cooling systems could
therefore play an important role as an efficient micro-cooling technology for

numerical value to by experiments or by measurements, or accessible. One basic
assumption in [4] and here is that group actions g 2 G are defined on a space
where some maximally accessible variable varies, and then accessible functions
of these maximal variables are introduced. By using group representation theory
the basic Hilbert space formalism is restored under the assumption that the

a temporal network. We refer to this tendency, when observed, as the ""temporal
rich club phenomenon"". We illustrate the interest of this concept by analyzing
diverse data sets under this lens, and showing how it enables a new perspective
on their temporal patterns, from the role of cohesive structures in relation to
processes unfolding on top of the network to the study of specific moments of
interest in the evolution of the network.

  Nodes",,,,,"math.OC cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this article, a new notion of modal strong structural controllability is
introduced and examined for a family of LTI networks. These networks include
structured LTI subsystems, whose system matrices have the same
zero/nonzero/arbitrary pattern. An eigenvalue associated with a system matrix
is controllable if it can be directly influenced by the control inputs. We
consider an arbitrary set \Delta, and we refer to a network as modal strongly
structurally controllable with respect to \Delta if, for all systems in a
specific family of LTI networks, every \lambda\in\Delta is a controllable
eigenvalue. For this family of LTI networks, not only is the
zero/nonzero/arbitrary pattern of system matrices available, but also for a
given \Delta, there might be extra information about the intersection of the
spectrum associated with some subsystems and \Delta. Given a set \Delta, we
first define a \Delta-network graph, and by introducing a coloring process of
this graph, we establish a correspondence between the set of control subsystems
and the so-called zero forcing sets. We also demonstrate how with \Delta={0} or
\Delta=C\{0}, existing results on strong structural controllability can be
derived through our approach. Compared to relevant literature, a more
restricted family of LTI networks is considered in this work, and then, the
derived condition is less conservative.

advances in pathology image segmentation. However, pathology image segmentation
encounters with a dilemma in which the higher-performance networks generally

employment of high-accuracy networks in real scenes due to the inherent
high-resolution of pathological images. To tackle this problem, we propose CoCo

general technique which aims at improving the performance of a compact network
through knowledge transfer from a cumbersome network. Concretely, our CoCo
DistillNet models the correlations of channel-mixed spatial similarity between
different layers and then transfers this knowledge from a pre-trained
cumbersome teacher network to a non-trained compact student network. In
addition, we also utilize the adversarial learning strategy to further prompt
the distilling procedure which is called Adversarial Distillation (AD).
Furthermore, to stabilize our training procedure, we make the use of the
unsupervised Paraphraser Module (PM) to boost the knowledge paraphrase in the
teacher network. As a result, extensive experiments conducted on the Gastric
Cancer Segmentation Dataset demonstrate the prominent ability of CoCo
DistillNet which achieves state-of-the-art performance.

more important as wind power production continues to increase year after year.
Having accurate forecasts for the energy market clashes with intrinsic
difficulties of wind forecasts due to, e.g., the coarse resolution of Numerical
Weather Prediction models. Here, we propose a novel Ensemble Model Output
Statistics (EMOS) which accounts for nonlinear relationships between
predictands and both predictors and other weather observables used as
conditioning variables. The strategy is computationally cheap and
easy-to-implement with respect to other more complex strategies dealing with
nonlinear regressions. Our novel strategy is assessed in a systematic way to
quantify its added value with respect to ordinary, linear, EMOS strategies.
Wind speed/power forecasts over Italy from the Ensemble Prediction System (EPS)
in use at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) are
considered for this purpose. The calibrations are based on the use of past wind
speed measurements collected by 69 SYNOP stations over Italy in the years 2018
and 2019. Our results show the key role played by conditioning variables to
disentangle the model error thus allowing a net improvement of the calibration

trained by pooling Air Traffic Controller (ATCO) and pilot data into one set.
This is motivated by the fact that pilot's voice communications are more scarce
than ATCOs. Due to this data imbalance and other reasons (e.g., varying
acoustic conditions), the speech from ATCOs is usually recognized more
accurately than from pilots. Automatically identifying the speaker roles is a
challenging task, especially in the case of the noisy voice recordings
collected using Very High Frequency (VHF) receivers or due to the
unavailability of the push-to-talk (PTT) signal, i.e., both audio channels are
mixed. In this work, we propose to (1) automatically segment the ATCO and pilot
data based on an intuitive approach exploiting ASR transcripts and (2)
subsequently consider an automatic recognition of ATCOs' and pilots' voice as
two separate tasks. Our work is performed on VHF audio data with high noise
levels, i.e., signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios below 15 dB, as this data is
recognized to be helpful for various speech-based machine-learning tasks.
Specifically, for the speaker role identification task, the module is
represented by a simple yet efficient knowledge-based system exploiting a
grammar defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The
system accepts text as the input, either manually verified annotations or
automatically generated transcripts. The developed approach provides an average
accuracy in speaker role identification of about 83%. Finally, we show that
training an acoustic model for ASR tasks separately (i.e., separate models for
ATCOs and pilots) or using a multitask approach is well suited for the noisy
data and outperforms the traditional ASR system where all data is pooled
together.

and some locations are quite the opposite. A misalignment exists between the
two tasks, and their features are spatially entangled. In order to solve the
misalignment problem, we propose a plug-in Spatial-disentangled and
Task-aligned operator (SALT). By predicting two task-aware point sets that are
located in each task's sensitive regions, SALT can reassign features from those

for the two tasks are spatially aligned and disentangled. To minimize the
difference between the two regression stages, we propose a Self-distillation

to be harder than expected, probably due to the difficulty of labeled data
collection for model training. Self-supervised learning (SSL), which leverages
unlabeled data only for representation learning, might be a promising way to
improve model performance. Existing SSL methods, however, usually rely on the
single-centric-object guarantee, which may not be applicable for multi-instance
datasets such as street scenes. To alleviate this limitation, we raise two
issues to solve: (1) how to define positive samples for cross-view consistency
and (2) how to measure similarity in multi-instance circumstances. We first
adopt an IoU threshold during random cropping to transfer global-inconsistency
to local-consistency. Then, we propose two feature alignment methods to enable
2D feature maps for multi-instance similarity measurement. Additionally, we
adopt intra-image clustering with self-attention for further mining intra-image
similarity and translation-invariance. Experiments show that, when pre-trained
on Waymo dataset, our method called Multi-instance Siamese Network (MultiSiam)
remarkably improves generalization ability and achieves state-of-the-art
transfer performance on autonomous driving benchmarks, including Cityscapes and
BDD100K, while existing SSL counterparts like MoCo, MoCo-v2, and BYOL show
significant performance drop. By pre-training on SODA10M, a large-scale

how service incidents are managed will significantly impact company revenue and

efficient incident management, related incidents should be quickly aggregated
to narrow down the problem scope. To this end, in this paper, we propose GRLIA,
an incident aggregation framework based on graph representation learning over
the cascading graph of cloud failures. A representation vector is learned for
each unique type of incident in an unsupervised and unified manner, which is
able to simultaneously encode the topological and temporal correlations among
incidents. Thus, it can be easily employed for online incident aggregation. In
particular, to learn the correlations more accurately, we try to recover the
complete scope of failures' cascading impact by leveraging fine-grained system
monitoring data, i.e., Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The proposed
framework is evaluated with real-world incident data collected from a
large-scale online service system of Huawei Cloud. The experimental results
demonstrate that GRLIA is effective and outperforms existing methods.
Furthermore, our framework has been successfully deployed in industrial

characteristics in the ordered arrays ($l^{}_x\times l^{}_y$) of magnetic

interaction strength $h^{}_d$, and external magnetic field directions. We have
considered the aligned anisotropy case, $\alpha$ is the orientational angle. It
provides an elegant en route to unearth the explicit role of anisotropy and
dipolar interaction on the hysteresis response in such a versatile system. The
superparamagnetic character is dominant with weak dipolar interaction
($h^{}_d\leq0.2$), resulting in the minimal hysteresis loop area. Remarkably,
the double-loop hysteresis emerges even with moderate interaction strength
($h^{}_d\approx0.4$), reminiscent of antiferromagnetic coupling. These features
are strongly dependent on $\alpha$ and $A^{}_r$. Interestingly, the hysteresis
loop area increases with $h^{}_d$, provided $A^{}_r$ is enormous, and the
external magnetic field is along the $y$-direction. The coercive field
$\mu^{}_oH^{}_c$, remanent magnetization $M^{}_r$, and the heat dissipation
$E^{}_H$ also depend strongly on these parameters. Irrespective of the external
field direction and weak dipolar interaction ($h^{}_d\leq0.4$), there is an
increase in $\mu^{}_oH^{}_c$ with $h^{}_d$ for a fixed $\alpha$ and
$A^{}_r\leq4.0$. The dipolar interaction also elevates $M^{}_r$ as long as
$A^{}_r$ is huge and the field is along the $y$-direction. $E^{}_H$ is minimal
for negligible and weak dipolar interaction, irrespective of $A^{}_r$,
$\alpha$, and the field directions. Notably, the magnetic interaction enhances
$E^{}_H$ if $A^{}_r$ is enormous and the magnetic field is along the long axis
of the system. These results are beneficial in various applications of interest

which yields significant (700+ Gflop/s) single-precision performance and an
upwards of 2x reduction in runtime for the local evaluation of the Laplace

focused on the use of query-focused extractive summarisation to obtain the
ideal answers to medical questions. The Synergy Task is an end-to-end question
answering task on COVID-19 where systems are required to return relevant
documents, snippets, and answers to a given question. Given the absence of
training data, we used a query-focused summarisation system that was trained
with the BioASQ8b training data set and we experimented with methods to
retrieve the documents and snippets. Considering the poor quality of the
documents and snippets retrieved by our system, we observed reasonably good
quality in the answers returned. For phase B of the BioASQ9b task, the relevant
documents and snippets were already included in the test data. Our system split
the snippets into candidate sentences and used BERT variants under a sentence
classification setup. The system used the question and candidate sentence as
input and was trained to predict the likelihood of the candidate sentence being
part of the ideal answer. The runs obtained either the best or second best
ROUGE-F1 results of all participants to all batches of BioASQ9b. This shows
that using BERT in a classification setup is a very strong baseline for the

This study presents the results of an experiment we performed to
measure the coverage of Digital Humanities (DH) publications in mainstream open

relations among DH and other disciplines. Methodology. We created a list of DH
journals based on manual curation and bibliometric data. We used that list to
identify DH publications in the bibliographic data sources under consideration.
We used the ERIH-PLUS list of journals to identify Social Sciences and
Humanities (SSH) publications. We analysed the citation links they included to
understand the relationship between DH publications and SSH and non-SSH fields.
Findings. Crossref emerges as the database containing the highest number of DH
publications. Citations from and to DH publications show strong connections
between DH and research in Computer Science, Linguistics, Psychology, and
Pedagogical & Educational Research. Computer Science is responsible for a large
part of incoming and outgoing citations to and from DH research, which suggests
a reciprocal interest between the two disciplines. Value. This is the first
bibliometric study of DH research involving several bibliographic data sources,
including open and proprietary databases. Research limitations. The list of DH
journals we created might be only partially representative of broader DH
research. In addition, some DH publications could have been cut off from the
study since we did not consider books and other publications published in
proceedings of DH conferences and workshops. Finally, we used a specific time
coverage (2000-2018) that could have prevented the inclusion of additional DH
publications.

successfully been utilized for a broad range of tasks, including phishing

trivial task, and requires data scientists with knowledge of the relevant
domain. Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks have received a lot of
attention in recent years, enabling non-ML experts in building a machine
learning model. This brings to an intriguing question of whether AutoML can
outperform the results achieved by human data scientists. Our paper compares
the performances of six well-known, state-of-the-art AutoML frameworks on ten
different phishing datasets to see whether AutoML-based models can outperform
manually crafted machine learning models. Our results indicate that
AutoML-based models are able to outperform manually developed machine learning
models in complex classification tasks, specifically in datasets where the
features are not quite discriminative, and datasets with overlapping classes or
relatively high degrees of non-linearity. Challenges also remain in building a
real-world phishing detection system using AutoML frameworks due to the current
support only on supervised classification problems, leading to the need for
labeled data, and the inability to update the AutoML-based models
incrementally. This indicates that experts with knowledge in the domain of

study the electronic band structure of plasmonic excitations in streaming

hydrodynamic model is used to obtain $N$-coupled pseudoforce differential
equation system from which the energy band structure of plasmonic excitations
is calculated. It is shown that inevitable appearance of energy bands separated
by gaps can be due to discrete velocity filaments and their electrostatic mode
coupling in the electron gas. Current model also provides an alternative
description of collisionless damping and phase mixing, i.e., collective
scattering phenomenon within the energy band gaps due to mode coupling between
wave-like and particle-like oscillations. The quantum multistream model is
further generalized to include virtual streams which is used to calculate the
electronic band structure of one-dimensional plasmonic crystals. It is remarked
that, unlike the empty lattice approximation in free electron model, energy
band gaps exist in plasmon excitations due to the collective electrostatic
interactions between electrons. It is also shown that the plasmonic band gap
size at first Brillouin zone boundary maximizes at the reciprocal lattice
vector, $G$, close to metallic densities. Furthermore, the electron-lattice
binding and electron-phonon coupling strength effects on the electronic band

lateral coupling which causes blueshifts in the plasmonic resonance, while in
the random aggregates there are redshifts in the plasmonic resonance. The
plasmon response of latter could be tailored up to the second infrared

higher absorption power and therefore, higher temperature rise compared to the
single gold nanorod or monodispersive nanorods. The absorption resonance peak
position of the random aggregate depends on the incident and polarization
angles of the incident light. The aggregation of the nanoparticles often

largely independent of each other except for input sharing. We propose a
partition filter network to model two-way interaction between tasks properly,
where feature encoding is decomposed into two steps: partition and filter. In
our encoder, we leverage two gates: entity and relation gate, to segment
neurons into two task partitions and one shared partition. The shared partition
represents inter-task information valuable to both tasks and is evenly shared
across two tasks to ensure proper two-way interaction. The task partitions
represent intra-task information and are formed through concerted efforts of
both gates, making sure that encoding of task-specific features is dependent
upon each other. Experiment results on six public datasets show that our model
performs significantly better than previous approaches. In addition, contrary

$\sim 1\%$ precision in a redshift range of $0<z<1$. Such precise measurements
enable one to put a 1.5\% level constraint on $\sigma_8\,

(MAIC) are increasingly used to compare marginal treatment effects when there
are cross-trial differences in effect modifiers and limited patient-level data.
MAIC is based on propensity score weighting, which is sensitive to poor
covariate overlap and cannot extrapolate beyond the observed covariate space.
Current outcome regression-based alternatives can extrapolate but target a
conditional treatment effect that is incompatible in the indirect comparison.
When adjusting for covariates, one must integrate or average the conditional
estimate over the relevant population to recover a compatible marginal
treatment effect. We propose a marginalization method based on parametric
G-computation that can be easily applied where the outcome regression is a
generalized linear model or a Cox model. The approach views the covariate
adjustment regression as a nuisance model and separates its estimation from the
evaluation of the marginal treatment effect of interest. The method can
accommodate a Bayesian statistical framework, which naturally integrates the
analysis into a probabilistic framework. A simulation study provides
proof-of-principle and benchmarks the method's performance against MAIC and the
conventional outcome regression. Parametric G-computation achieves more precise
and more accurate estimates than MAIC, particularly when covariate overlap is
poor, and yields unbiased marginal treatment effect estimates under no failures
of assumptions. Furthermore, the marginalized regression-adjusted estimates
provide greater precision and accuracy than the conditional estimates produced
by the conventional outcome regression, which are systematically biased because
the measure of effect is non-collapsible.

inexplicable phenomena in low-temperature quantum many-body physics. Such
macroscopic quantumness is often evaluated using long-range entanglement, i.e.,
entanglement in the macroscopic length scale. The long-range entanglement not
only characterizes the novel quantum phases but also serves as a critical
resource for quantum computation. Thus, the problem that arises is under which
conditions can the long-range entanglement be stable even at room temperatures.
Here, we show that bi-partite long-range entanglement is unstable at arbitrary
temperatures and exponentially decays with distance. Our theorem provides a
no-go theorem on the existence of the long-range entanglement. The obtained
results are consistent with the existing observations that long-range
entanglement at non-zero temperatures can exist in topologically ordered
phases, where tripartite correlations are dominant. In the derivation of our
result, we introduce a quantum correlation defined by the convex roof of the
standard correlation function. We establish an exponential clustering theorem
for generic quantum many-body systems for such a quantum correlation at
arbitrary temperatures, which yields our main result by relating quantum
correlation to quantum entanglement. As a simple application of our analytical
techniques, we derived a general limit on the Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew
information and the quantum Fisher information, which will attract significant
attention in the field of quantum metrology. Our work reveals novel general
aspects of low-temperature quantum physics and sheds light on the
characterization of long-range entanglement.

  This paper presents Enel, a novel dynamic scaling approach that uses message

absorb all metal layer details, i.e., all wires, to enable composition by
abutment of valid; valid in the sense of being technology design rules
compliant, timing clean and OCV ruggedized. Effectively, composition by
abutment eliminates logic and physical synthesis for the end user. Like Lego
system, synchoricity does need a finite number of SiLago block types to cater
to different types of designs. Global NoCs are important system level design
components. In this paper, we show, how with a small library of SiLago blocks
for global NoCs, it is possible to automatically synthesize arbitrary global
NoCs of different types, dimensions, and topology. The synthesized global NoCs
are not only valid VLSI designs, their cost metrics (area, latency, and energy)
are known with post-layout accuracy in linear time. We argue that this is
essential to be able to do chip-level design space exploration. We show how the
abstract timing model of such global NoC SiLago blocks can be built and used to
analyse the timing of global NoC links with post layout accuracy and in linear
time. We validate this claim by subjecting the same VLSI designs of global NoC

with an oscillating pivot. This simple mechanical setting is frequently used as
the prime example of a system exhibiting the parametric resonance phenomenon,
which manifests itself by surprising stabilisation/destabilisation effects. In
the classical case the pivot oscillations are described by a cosine wave, and
the corresponding stability analysis requires one to investigate the behaviour
of solutions to the Mathieu equation. This is not a straightforward procedure,
and it does not lead to exact and simple analytical results expressed in terms
of elementary functions. Consequently, the explanation of the parametric
resonance phenomenon can be in this case obscured by the relatively involved
technical calculations. We show that the stability analysis is much easier if
one considers the pivot motion described by a non-smooth function -- a
triangular or a nearly rectangular wave. The non-smooth pivot motion leads to
the presence of singularities (Dirac distributions) in the corresponding
Mathieu type equation, which seemingly further complicates the analysis.
Fortunately, this is only a minor technical difficulty. Once the mathematical
setting for the non-smooth forcing is settled down, the corresponding stability
diagram is indeed straightforward to obtain, and the stability boundaries are,
unlike in the classical case, given in terms of simple analytical formulae
involving only elementary functions.

particular, the three effects explicitly covered are reflections at the
underbody of a car or truck, signals traveling back and forth between the
vehicle on which the sensor is mounted and another object, and multipath
propagation via specular reflection. The latter often occurs near guardrails,
concrete walls or similar reflective surfaces. Each of these effects is
described both theoretically and regarding a method for identifying the
corresponding clutter detections. Identification is done by analyzing
detections generated from a single sensor measurement only. The final algorithm
is evaluated on recordings of real extra-urban traffic. For labeling, a
semi-automatic process is employed. The results are promising, both in terms of
performance and regarding the very low execution time. Typically, a large part
of clutter is found, while only a small ratio of detections corresponding to
real objects are falsely classified by the algorithm.

correction as it allows for correction against losses--the dominant error

efficiently without disturbing the encoded logical information, one needs to
implement a parity measurement of the excitation number. While such a
measurement has been demonstrated in the microwave regime using a
superconducting transmon ancilla, it has remained unclear how it can be
implemented in the optical regime. Here, we introduce a teleportation-based

from synthesized speech, effectively learning from untranscribed speech and
unspoken text. Lexical learning in the speech encoder is enforced through an
additional sequence loss term that is coupled with contrastive loss during
pretraining. We demonstrate that this novel pretraining method yields Word
Error Rate (WER) reductions of 10% relative on the well-benchmarked,
Librispeech task over a state-of-the-art baseline pretrained with wav2vec2.0

for the lack of transcribed speech, effectively matching the performance of
5000 hours of transcribed speech with just 100 hours of transcribed speech on
the AMI meeting transcription task. Finally, we demonstrate WER reductions of
up to 15% on an in-house Voice Search task over traditional pretraining.
Incorporating text into encoder pretraining is complimentary to rescoring with
a larger or in-domain language model, resulting in additional 6% relative
reduction in WER.

objects prototype BL Lacertae carried out over a period of nearly 13 years,
between August 2008 and March 2021. The source is characterized by strongly
variable emission at all frequencies, often accompanied by spectral changes. In
the $\gamma$-ray band several prominent flares have been detected, the largest
one reaching the flux of $F_{\rm \gamma}(>196.7\: {\rm

spectral variability of the source during the brightest flare on MJD 59128.18
(06 October 2020) was characterized by a softer-when-brighter trend due to a
shift of the synchrotron peak to $\sim 10^{16}$ Hz, well into the HBL domain.
The widely changing multiwavelength emission of BL Lacertae was systematically
investigated by fitting leptonic models that include synchrotron self-Compton
and external Compton components to 511 high-quality and quasi-simultaneous
broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The majority of selected SEDs
can be adequately fitted within a one-zone model with reasonable parameters.
Only 46 SEDs with soft and bright X-ray spectra and when the source was
observed in very high energy $\gamma$-ray bands can be explained in a two-zone
leptonic scenario. The HBL behaviour observed during the brightest X-ray flare
is interpreted as due to the emergence of synchrotron emission from freshly
accelerated particles in a second emission zone located beyond the broad line
region.

in statistical physics to model ferromagnetism. This is a discrete exponential
family with binary outcomes, where the sufficient statistic involves a
quadratic term designed to capture correlations arising from pairwise
interactions. However, in many situations the dependencies in a network arise
not just from pairs, but from peer-group effects. A convenient mathematical
framework for capturing higher-order dependencies, is the $p$-tensor Ising
model, where the sufficient statistic consists of a multilinear polynomial of
degree $p$. This thesis develops a framework for statistical inference of the
natural parameters in $p$-tensor Ising models. We begin with the Curie-Weiss
Ising model, where we unearth various non-standard phenomena in the asymptotics
of the maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates of the parameters, such as the
presence of a critical curve in the interior of the parameter space on which
these estimates have a limiting mixture distribution, and a surprising
superefficiency phenomenon at the boundary point(s) of this curve. ML
estimation fails in more general $p$-tensor Ising models due to the presence of
a computationally intractable normalizing constant. To overcome this issue, we
use the popular maximum pseudo-likelihood (MPL) method, which avoids computing
the inexplicit normalizing constant based on conditional distributions. We
derive general conditions under which the MPL estimate is
$\sqrt{N}$-consistent, where $N$ is the size of the underlying network.
Finally, we consider a more general Ising model, which incorporates
high-dimensional covariates at the nodes of the network, that can also be
viewed as a logistic regression model with dependent observations. In this
model, we show that the parameters can be estimated consistently under sparsity
assumptions on the true covariate vector.

oscillator and as such plays an outstanding role in science and technology.
Experimentally, the system parameters are determined by a measurement of its
response to an external excitation. When changing the amplitude or frequency of
the external excitation, a sudden jump in the response function reveals the
nonlinear dynamics prominently. However, this bistability leaves part of the
full response function unobserved, which limits the precise measurement of the
system parameters. Here, we exploit the often unknown fact that the response of
a Duffing oscillator with nonlinear damping is a unique function of its phase.
By actively stabilizing the oscillator's phase we map out the full response
function. This phase control allows us to precisely determine the system
parameters. Our results are particularly important for characterizing nanoscale
resonators, where nonlinear effects are observed readily and which hold great
promise for next generation of ultrasensitive force and mass measurements. We
demonstrate our approach experimentally with an optically levitated particle in

little is known of magnetic interactions between Ag(II) cations and other
paramagnetic centres. It is because only a few compounds bearing Ag(II) cation
and other paramagnetic transition metal cation are known experimentally.
Recently the high-pressure synthesis of ternary silver(II) fluorides with 3d
metal cations AgMF4 (M = Co, Ni, Cu) was predicted to be feasible. Here, we
investigate the magnetic properties of these compounds in their diverse
polymorphic forms. Using well established computational methods we predict
superexchange pathways in AgMF4, evaluate coupling constants and calculate the
impact of Ag(II) presence on superexchange between the other cations. The
results indicate that the low-pressure form of AgCuF4, the only composed of
stacked layers as the parent AgF2, would hold mainly Ag-Ag and Cu-Cu
superexchange interactions. Upon compression, or with the nickel(II) cation,
the Ag-M interactions in AgMF4 intensify, which is emphasized by an increase of
Ag-M superexchange coupling constants and Ag-F-M angles. All the strongest Ag-M
superexchange pathways are quasi-linear, leading to the formation of
antiferromagnetic chains along the crystallographic directions. The impact of
Ag(II) on M-M superexchange turns out to be moderate, due to factors connected

that dark matter is made of axions. An analysis of charge asymmetry in kaon
decays suggests that at least in the local halo dark matter is made of axions
and that axions from the local halo are responsible for the observed violation
by these reactions of the combined charge conjugation and spatial inversion
symmetry operation. Tabletop experiments to directly detect dark matter in the
form of axions with the proposed mass are proposed.

complexity of polaritonic chemistry, which emerges from the hybrid nature of
strongly coupled light-matter states. To tackle this complexity, the importance
of ab initio methods is highlighted. Based on those, novel ideas and research
avenues are developed with respect to quantum collectivity, as well as for
resonance phenomena immanent in reaction rates under vibrational strong
coupling. Indeed, fundamental theoretical questions arise about the mesoscopic
scale of quantum-collectively coupled molecules, when considering the
depolarization shift in the interpretation of experimental data. Furthermore,
to rationalise recent findings based on quantum electrodynamical
density-functional theory (QEDFT), a simple, but computationally efficient,
Langevin framework is proposed, based on well-established methods from
molecular dynamics. It suggests the emergence of cavity induced non-equilibrium
nuclear dynamics, where thermal (stochastic) resonance phenomena could emerge
in the absence of external periodic driving. Overall, we believe the latest ab
initio results indeed suggest a paradigmatic shift for ground-state chemical
reactions under vibrational strong coupling, from the collective quantum
interpretation towards a more local, (semi)-classically and non-equilibrium
dominated perspective. Finally, various extensions towards a refined
description of cavity-modified chemistry are introduced in the context of QEDFT
and future directions of the field are sketched.

modified planning algorithm for finite temporal horizons. We build upon this
work to assess the utility of active inference for a stochastic control

additional complexities, namely: 1) environment stochasticity; 2) learning of

attempt to address this problem without introducing additional harms. We
conduct a large-scale empirical study of DRO and several variations of standard

performs better, for each patient subpopulation examined, than standard

when it is of interest to improve model performance for patient subpopulations
beyond what can be achieved with standard practices, it may be necessary to do
so via data collection techniques that increase the effective sample size or
reduce the level of noise in the prediction problem.

the peak BD probability is regularly observed around 1 s after the end of the

`extreme-TeV' blazars, with Compton peak frequencies around 1 TeV, is difficult
to interpret with standard one-zone emission models. Large values of the
minimum electron Lorentz factor and quite low magnetisation values seem to be
required. We propose a scenario where protons and electrons are co-accelerated
on internal or recollimation shocks inside the relativistic jet. In this
situation, energy is transferred from the protons to the electrons in the shock
transition layer, leading naturally to a high minimum Lorentz factor for the
latter. A low magnetisation favours the acceleration of particles in
relativistic shocks. The shock co-acceleration scenario provides additional
constraints on the set of parameters of a standard one-zone lepto-hadronic
emission model, reducing its degeneracy. Values of the magnetic field strength
of a few mG and minimum electron Lorentz factors of 10^3 to 10^4, required to
provide a satisfactory description of the observed spectral energy
distributions of extreme blazars, result here from first principles. While
acceleration on a single standing shock is sufficient to reproduce the emission
of most of the extreme-TeV sources we have examined, re-acceleration on a
second shock appears needed for those objects with the hardest gamma-ray
spectra. Emission from the accelerated proton population, with the same number
density as the electrons but in a lower range of Lorentz factors, is strongly
suppressed. Satisfactory self-consistent representations were found for the

Bennett Acceptance Ratio (BAR) and Variationally Derived Intermediates (VI)

error of free energy calculations based on independent sampling is minimized.
However, BAR and VI have been derived based on several approximations that do
not hold for very few sample points. Analyzing one-dimensional test systems we
show that in such cases BAR and VI are suboptimal and that established
uncertainty estimates are inaccurate. Whereas for VI to become optimal less
than seven samples per state suffice in all cases, for BAR the required number
increases unboundedly with decreasing configuration space densities overlap of
the end states. We show that for BAR the required number of samples is related
to the overlap through an inverse power law. Because this relation seems to
hold universally and almost independent of other system properties, these
findings can guide the proper choice of estimator for free energy calculations.

that the life cycle of adversarial discriminators should not end after

develop stable mask discriminators that do not overfit or catastrophically

transferring knowledge from a source domain. However, due to two main issues:
feature discrepancy and distribution divergence, transfer learning can be a
very difficult problem in practice. In this paper, we present a framework
called TLF that builds a classifier for the target domain having only few
labeled training records by transferring knowledge from the source domain
having many labeled records. While existing methods often focus on one issue
and leave the other one for the further work, TLF is capable of handling both
issues simultaneously. In TLF, we alleviate feature discrepancy by identifying
shared label distributions that act as the pivots to bridge the domains. We
handle distribution divergence by simultaneously optimizing the structural risk
functional, joint distributions between domains, and the manifold consistency
underlying marginal distributions. Moreover, for the manifold consistency we
exploit its intrinsic properties by identifying k nearest neighbors of a
record, where the value of k is determined automatically in TLF. Furthermore,
since negative transfer is not desired, we consider only the source records
that are belonging to the source pivots during the knowledge transfer. We
evaluate TLF on seven publicly available natural datasets and compare the
performance of TLF against the performance of fourteen state-of-the-art
techniques. We also evaluate the effectiveness of TLF in some challenging
situations. Our experimental results, including statistical sign test and
Nemenyi test analyses, indicate a clear superiority of the proposed framework

as an interesting alternative to the traditional indirect optimal control. The
method relies on the first discretize and then optimize paradigm, where a
discretization of the dynamical equations leads to a nonlinear optimization

where the wavepacket had been approximated by a parameterized Gaussian, leading
to a semiclassical set of equations of motion (A. R. Ramos Ramos, O. K\""uhn,

we extend the application of the method to the case of exact wavepacket

we address the question how population of the involved overtone state can be
avoided such as to reduce the effect of intramolecular vibrational energy
redistribution. A methodological advantage is that direct optimal control
theory offers flexibility when choosing the running cost, since there is no
need to compute functional derivatives and coupling terms as in the case of
indirect optimal control. We exploit this fact to include state populations in
the running cost, which allows their optimization.

State-of-the-art accident prediction approaches are based on static and uniform
grid-based geospatial aggregations, limiting their capability for fine-grained
predictions. This property becomes particularly problematic in more complex
regions such as city centers. In such regions, a grid cell can contain
subregions with different properties; furthermore, an actual accident-prone
region can be split across grid cells arbitrarily. This paper proposes Adaptive
Clustering Accident Prediction (ACAP) - a novel accident prediction method
based on a grid growing algorithm. ACAP applies adaptive clustering to the
observed geospatial accident distribution and performs embeddings of temporal,
accident-related, and regional features to increase prediction accuracy. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ACAP method using open real-world
accident datasets from three cities in Germany. We demonstrate that ACAP
improves the accident prediction performance for complex regions by 2-3 percent
points in F1-score by adapting the geospatial aggregation to the distribution
of the underlying spatio-temporal events. Our grid growing approach outperforms
the clustering-based baselines by four percent points in terms of F1-score on

two different angles of attack: 5 and 11 degrees. The mesh is evolved from a
very coarse initial mesh by means of volume-weighted spectral error indicators,
until a sufficient level of resolution is achieved at the boundary and wake
regions. The non-conformal implementation of AMR allows the use of a large
domain avoiding the need of a precursor RANS simulation to obtain the boundary
conditions (BCs). This eliminates the effect of the steady Dirichlet BCs on the
flow, which becomes a relevant source of error at higher angles of attack
(specially near the trailing edge and wake regions). Furthermore,
over-refinement in the far field and the associated high-aspect ratio elements
are avoided, meaning less pressure-iterations of the solver and a reduced
number of elements, which leads to a considerable computational cost reduction.
Mean flow statistics are validated using experimental data obtained for the
same profile in the Minimum Turbulence Level (MTL) wind tunnel at KTH, as well
as with a previous DNS simulation, showing excellent agreement. This work
constitutes an important step in the direction of studying stronger pressure
gradients and higher Reynolds complex flows with the high fidelity that
high-order simulations allow to achieve. Eventually, this database can be used

accuracy thresholds when the number of summands is large. In this work, we
first identify the main contributors to mux adder error. We then demonstrate
with analysis and experiment that two new techniques, precise sampling and full
correlation, can target and mitigate these error sources. Implementing these
techniques in hardware leads to the design of CeMux (Correlation-enhanced
Multiplexer), a stochastic mux adder that is significantly more accurate and
uses much less area than traditional weighted adders. We compare CeMux to other
SC and hybrid designs for an electrocardiogram filtering case study that
employs a large digital filter. One major result is that CeMux is shown to be
accurate even for large input sizes. CeMux's higher accuracy leads to a latency
reduction of 4x to 16x over other designs. Further, CeMux uses about 35% less
area than existing designs, and we demonstrate that a small amount of accuracy
can be traded for a further 50% reduction in area. Finally, we compare CeMux to
a conventional binary design and we show that CeMux can achieve a 50 to 73%
area reduction for similar power and latency as the conventional design, but at
a slightly higher level of error.

that emerge in protobinary configurations in a gravoturbulent gas collapse. We
find in most of these protobinary systems strong accretion bursts between the
two companions with a recurrence time-scale of about 1 kyr. The accretion rate
onto the secondary star typically exceeds that onto the primary with a peak
value of 2 $\times 10^{-2}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for the former and 6 $\times
10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for the latter. We propose that the secondary
companion which remains more active in its episodes of accretion bursts,
especially for the gas cores with subsonic velocity dispersion, may provide
observational opportunities to find traces of episodic accretion in the
surrounding gas of the embedded YSOs that are in a binary configuration. Also,
protostars evolving as single objects in the same environment show fewer
accretion bursts and all together a more steady mass growth history. The
prestellar cores with subsonic velocity dispersion exhibit an order of
magnitude more intense accretion bursts than in the case of cores with
supersonic velocity dispersions. The latter shows the formation of some of the
protobinaries in which the primary acts as a more actively accreting companion.
This can support these binaries to become systems of extreme mass ratio.
Moreover, the YSOs in binary configurations with small semi-major axis $a$
$\approx$ 50 au and high mass ratio $q$ > 0.7 support phases of intense
episodic accretion. The eccentricity, however, seems to play no significant
role in the occurrence of accretion bursts.

statistical inference procedures for high dimensional mediation models, in
which both the outcome model and the mediator model are linear with high
dimensional mediators. Traditional procedures for mediation analysis cannot be
used to make statistical inference for high dimensional linear mediation models
due to high-dimensionality of the mediators. We propose an estimation procedure
for the indirect effects of the models via a partial penalized least squares
method, and further establish its theoretical properties. We further develop a
partial penalized Wald test on the indirect effects, and prove that the
proposed test has a $\chi^2$ limiting null distribution. We also propose an
$F$-type test for direct effects and show that the proposed test asymptotically
follows a $\chi^2$-distribution under null hypothesis and a noncentral
$\chi^2$-distribution under local alternatives. Monte Carlo simulations are
conducted to examine the finite sample performance of the proposed tests and
compare their performance with existing ones. We further apply the newly

hypothesized that they form in the inner regions of protoplanetary discs, out
of the dust that may accumulate at the boundary between the inner region
susceptible to the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) and an MRI-dead zone
further out. In Paper I we presented a model for the viscous inner disc which
includes heating due to both irradiation and MRI-driven accretion; thermal and
non-thermal ionization; dust opacities; and dust effects on ionization. Here we
examine how the inner disc structure varies with stellar, disc and dust
parameters. For high accretion rates and small dust grains, we find that: (1)
the main sources of ionization are thermal ionization and thermionic and ion
emission; (2) the disc features a hot, high-viscosity inner region, and a local
gas pressure maximum at the outer edge of this region (in line with previous
studies); and (3) an increase in the dust-to-gas ratio pushes the pressure
maximum outwards. Consequently, dust can accumulate in such inner discs without
suppressing the MRI, with the amount of accumulation depending on the viscosity
in the MRI-dead regions. Conversely, for low accretion rates and large dust
grains, there appears to be an additional steady-state solution in which: (1)
stellar X-rays become the main source of ionization; (2) MRI-viscosity is high
throughout the disc; and (3) the pressure maximum ceases to exist. Hence, if
planets form in the inner disc, larger accretion rates (and thus younger disks)
are favoured.

There is a strong concern among the astronomical community about the

analyze the impact analysis of such constellations on optical and near-infrared
astronomical observations in a rigorous and quantitative way, using updated
constellation information, and considering imagers and spectrographs and their
very different characteristics. We introduce an analytical method that allows
us to rapidly and accurately evaluate the effect of a very large number of
satellites, accounting for their magnitudes and the effect of trailing of the
satellite image during the exposure. We use this to evaluate the impact on a
series of representative instruments, including imagers (traditional narrow
field instruments, wide-field survey cameras, and astro-photographic cameras)
and spectrographs (long-slit and fibre-fed), taking into account their limiting
magnitude. As already known (Walker et al. 2020), the effect of satellite
trails is more damaging for high-altitude satellites, on wide-field
instruments, or essentially during the first and last hours of the night.
Thanks to their brighter limiting magnitudes, low- and mid-resolution
spectrographs will be less affected, but the contamination will be at about the
same level as that of the science signal, introducing additional challenges.
High-resolution spectrographs will essentially be immune. We propose a series
of mitigating measures, including one that uses the described simulation method
to optimize the scheduling of the observations. We conclude that no single
mitigation measure will solve the problem of satellite trails for all
instruments and all science cases.

complex physics-based models of real-world processes by inexpensive surrogates
that capture important dynamical characteristics with a smaller number of

decomposition (POD) focus on linear projections of the dynamics onto a set of
spectral features. In this paper we explore the construction of ROM using
autoencoders (AE) that perform nonlinear projections of the system dynamics
onto a low dimensional manifold learned from data. The approach uses
convolutional neural networks (CNN) to learn spatial features as opposed to
spectral, and utilize a physics informed (PI) cost function in order to capture
temporal features as well. Our investigation using the quasi-geostrophic
equations reveals that while the PI cost function helps with spatial
reconstruction, spatial features are less powerful than spectral features, and
that construction of ROMs through machine learning-based methods requires
significant investigation into novel non-standard methodologies.

weights and combines cost functions that are based on several individual, local

of QF to capture perceived trajectory quality, we conduct an online experiment

The learnt parameters for the tuned crowd motion model maintain the influence
of the reference data which was used to weight the terms of QF.

develop analogues of the Matom\""{a}ki-Radziwill theorem that allow us to

variant of the Matom\""{a}ki-Radziwill theorem for divisor-bounded
multiplicative functions recently proven by the author.
  We consider two sets of applications of these methods. Our first application
shows that for an additive function $g: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{C}$ any
non-trivial savings in the size of the average gap $|g(n)-g(n-1)|$ implies that
$g$ must have a small first moment, i.e., the discrepancy of $g(n)$ from its
mean is small on average. We also obtain a variant of such a result for the
second moment of the gaps. This complements results of Elliott and of
Hildebrand.
  As a second application, we make partial progress on an old question of
Erd\H{o}s relating to characterizing $\log n$ as the only ""almost everywhere""
increasing additive function (up to constant factors). We show that if an
additive function is almost everywhere non-decreasing then it is almost
everywhere well-approximated by a constant times a logarithm. We also show that
if $g$ is a completely additive function such that the density of the set of
exceptions $\frac{1}{X}|\{n \leq X : g(n) < g(n-1)\}|$ decays like $O((\log

investigate the cosmological evolution, by extracting analytical expressions
for the dark energy density and equation-of-state parameters and we show that
the Universe exhibits the usual thermal history, with a transition redshift
from deceleration to acceleration at around 0.6. Furthermore, depending on the
value of $K$, the dark energy equation-of-state parameter deviates from
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology at small redshifts, while lying always in the phantom
regime, and at asymptotically large times the Universe always results in a
dark-energy dominated, de Sitter phase. Finally, even in the case where we do
not consider an explicit cosmological constant the resulting cosmology is very
interesting and in agreement with the observed behavior.

perpendicular magnetic field and cooled to very low temperatures provides a
rich platform for studies of many-body quantum phases. The magnetic field
quenches the electrons' kinetic energy and quantizes the energy into a set of
Landau levels, allowing the Coulomb interaction to dominate. In excited Landau
levels, the fine interplay between short- and long-range interactions
stabilizes bubble phases, Wigner crystals with more than one electron per unit
cell. Here we present the screening properties of bubble phases, probed via a
simple capacitance technique where the 2DES is placed between a top and a
bottom gate and the electric field penetrating through the 2DES is measured.
The bubbles formed at very low temperatures screen the electric field poorly as
they are pinned by the residual disorder potential, allowing a large electric
field to reach the top gate. As the temperature is increased, the penetrating
electric field decreases and, surprisingly, exhibits a pronounced minimum at a
temperature that appears to coincide with the melting temperature of the bubble
phase. We deduce a quantitative phase diagram for the transition from bubble to
liquid phases for Landau level filling factors $4\leq\nu\leq5$.

ventricular tachycardias (VTs). However, not only are ablation procedures long,
with relatively high risk, but success rates are punitively low, with frequent
VT recurrence. Personalized in-silico approaches have the opportunity to
address these limitations. However, state-of-the-art reaction diffusion (R-D)
simulations of VT induction and subsequent circuits used for in-silico ablation
target identification require long execution times, along with vast
computational resources, which are incompatible with the clinical workflow.
Here, we present the Virtual Induction and Treatment of Arrhythmias (VITA), a
novel, rapid and fully automated computational approach that uses
reaction-Eikonal methodology to induce VT and identify subsequent ablation
targets. The rationale for VITA is based on finding isosurfaces associated with
an activation wavefront that splits in the ventricles due to the presence of an
isolated isthmus of conduction within the scar; once identified, each isthmus
may be assessed for their vulnerability to sustain a reentrant circuit, and the
corresponding exit site automatically identified for potential ablation
targeting. VITA was tested on a virtual cohort of 7 post-infarcted porcine
hearts and the results compared to R-D simulations. Using only a standard
desktop machine, VITA could detect all scar-related VTs, simulating activation
time maps and ECGs (for clinical comparison) as well as computing ablation
targets in 48 minutes. The comparable VTs probed by the R-D simulations took
68.5 hours on 256 cores of high-performance computing infrastructure. The set
of lesions computed by VITA was shown to render the ventricular model VT-free.
VITA could be used in near real-time as a complementary modality aiding in
clinical decision-making in the treatment of post-infarction VTs.

feature importance methods for ""understanding"" a deep learning (DL) emulator of
climate. Specifically, we consider a multiple-input-single-output emulator that
uses a DenseNet encoder-decoder architecture and is trained to predict
interannual variations of sea surface temperature (SST) at 1, 6, and 9 month
lead times using the preceding 36 months of (appropriately filtered) SST data.
First, feature importance methods are employed for individual predictions to
spatio-temporally identify input features that are important for model
prediction at chosen geographical regions and chosen prediction lead times. In
a second step, we also examine the behavior of feature importance in a
generalized sense by considering an aggregation of the importance heatmaps over
training samples. We find that: 1) the climate emulator's prediction at any
geographical location depends dominantly on a small neighborhood around it; 2)
the longer the prediction lead time, the further back the ""importance"" extends;
and 3) to leading order, the temporal decay of ""importance"" is independent of
geographical location. An ablation experiment is adopted to verify the
findings. From the perspective of climate dynamics, these findings suggest a
dominant role for local processes and a negligible role for remote
teleconnections at the spatial and temporal scales we consider. From the
perspective of network architecture, the spatio-temporal relations between the
inputs and outputs we find suggest potential model refinements. We discuss
further extensions of our methods, some of which we are considering in ongoing

value, the article also advocates the route of rendering First Class into

well-defined reduced phase space and physical observables; absence of

promotion of fundamental Dirac brackets to quantum commutators. As First Class

  In many applications, the spatial distribution of a field needs to be
carefully monitored to detect spikes, discontinuities or dangerous
heterogeneities, but invasive monitoring approaches cannot be used. Besides,
technical specifications about the process might not be available by preventing
the adoption of an accurate model of the system. In this work, a
physics-informed, data-driven algorithm that allows addressing these
requirements is presented. The approach is based on the implementation of a
boundary element method (BEM)-scheme within a convolutional neural network.
Thanks to the capability of representing any continuous mathematical function
with a reduced number of parameters, the network allows predicting the field
value in any point of the domain, given the boundary conditions and few
measurements within the domain. The proposed approach was applied to
reconstruct a field described by the Helmholtz equation over a
three-dimensional domain. A sensitivity analysis was also performed by
investigating different physical conditions and different network
configurations. Since the only assumption is the applicability of BEM, the
current approach can be applied to the monitoring of a wide range of processes,
from the localization of the source of pollutant within a water reservoir to
the monitoring of the neutron flux in a nuclear reactor.

constituents? To understand part-whole relations between finite simple groups
and the global structure of finite groups, we axiomatize complexity measures on
finite groups. From the Jordan-H\""older theorem and Frobenius-Lagrange
embedding in an iterated wreath product, any finite group $G$ can be
constructed from a unique collection of simple groups, its Jordan-H\""older
factors, each with well-defined multiplicities through iterated extension. What
is the least number of levels needed in such a hierarchical construction if a
level is allowed to include several of these atomic pieces? To answer this
question rigorously, we give a natural set of hierarchical complexity axioms
for finite groups, and prove these axioms are satisfied by a unique maximal
complexity function $\mathbf{cx}$. We prove this function is the same as the
minimal number of ""spans of gems"" (direct products of simple groups) in a
subnormal series with all factors of this type. This hierarchical complexity is
thus effectively computable, and bounded below by all other complexity measures
satisfying the axioms, including generalizations of derived length and Fitting
height.
  For solvable groups, the unique maximal group complexity measure satisfying
the axioms agrees with the restriction of the one for all finite groups, and in
addition satisfies an embedding axiom. In both cases, the complexity of a group
is bounded above and below by various natural functions. In particular,
hierarchical complexity is sharply bounded above by socle length, with a
canonical decomposition. Examples illustrate applications of the bounds and
axiomatic methods in determining complexity of groups. We show also that
minimal decompositions need not be unique in terms of what components occur nor
their ordering. The complexity axioms are also shown to be independent.

SVM solution converges to a dissipative measure-valued martingale solution.
These solutions are weak in the probabilistic sense i.e. the probability space
and the driving Wiener process are an integral part of the solution. We also
exhibit weak (measure-valued)-strong uniqueness principle. Moreover, we
establish strong convergence of approximate solutions to the regular solution
of the limit system at least on the lifespan of the latter, thanks to the weak
(measure-valued)--strong uniqueness principle for the underlying system.

adaptation settings. Multi-target domain adaptation is a powerful extension in
which a single classifier is learned for multiple unlabeled target domains. To
build a multi-target classifier, it is important to have: a feature extractor
that generalizes well across domains; and effective aggregation of features
from the labeled source and different unlabeled target domains. Towards the
first, we use the recently popular Transformer as a feature extraction
backbone. Towards the second, we use a co-teaching-based approach using a
dual-classifier head, one of which is based on the graph neural network. The
proposed approach uses a sequential adaptation strategy that adapts one domain
at a time starting from the target domains that are more similar to the source,
assuming that the network finds it easier to adapt to such target domains.
After adapting on each target, samples with a softmax-based confidence score
greater than a threshold are added to the pseudo-source, thus aggregating
knowledge from different domains. However, softmax is not entirely trustworthy
as a confidence score and may generate a high score for unreliable samples if
trained for many iterations. To mitigate this effect, we adopt a reiterative
approach, where we reduce target adaptation iterations, however, reiterate
multiple times over the target domains. The experimental evaluation on the
Office-Home, Office-31 and DomainNet datasets shows significant improvement
over the existing methods. We have achieved 10.7$\%$ average improvement in
Office-Home dataset over the state-of-art methods.

Indeed, the study of
shapes is an important part of many scientific fields such as evolutionary
biology, structural biology, image processing, and archaeology. The most
widely-used method of shape analysis, Geometric Morphometrics, assumes that
that the mathematical space in which shapes are represented is linear. However,
it has long been known that shape space is, in fact, rather more complicated,
and certainly non-linear. Diffeomorphic methods that take this non-linearity
into account, and so give more accurate estimates of the distances among
shapes, exist but have rarely been applied to real-world problems. Using a
machine classifier, we tested the ability of several of these methods to
describe and classify the shapes of a variety of organic and man-made objects.
We find that one method, the Square-Root Velocity Function (SRVF), is superior
to all others, including a standard Geometric Morphometric method
(eigenshapes). We also show that computational shape classifiers outperform
human experts, and that the SRVF shortest-path between shapes can be used to
estimate the shapes of intermediate steps in evolutionary series. Diffeomorphic
shape analysis methods, we conclude, now provide practical and effective
solutions to many shape description and classification problems in the natural
and human sciences.

nanotechnologies for over 30 years, being present in many fields from condensed
matter physics to biology. It enables measuring very weak forces at the
nanoscale, thus elucidating interactions at play in fundamental processes. Here
we leverage the combined benefits of micro/nanoelectromechanical systems and
cavity optomechanics to fabricate a sensor for dynamic mode AFM at a frequency
above 100 MHz. This is two decades above the fastest commercial AFM probes,
suggesting opportunity for measuring forces at timescales unexplored so far.
The fabrication is achieved using very-large scale integration technologies
inherited from photonic silicon circuits. The probe's ring optomechanical
cavity is coupled to a 1.55 um laser light and features a 130 MHz mechanical
resonance mode with a quality factor of 900 in air. A limit of detection in
displacement of 3.10-16 m/sqrt(Hz) is obtained, enabling the detection of the
Brownian motion of the probe and paving the way for force sensing experiments
in the dynamic mode with a working vibration amplitude in the picometer range.
Inserted in a custom AFM instrument embodiment, this optomechanical sensor
demonstrates the capacity to perform force-distance measurements and to
maintain a constant interaction strength between tip and sample, an essential
requirement for AFM applications. Experiments show indeed a stable closed-loop
operation with a setpoint of 4 nN/nm for an unprecedented sub-picometer
vibration amplitude, where the tip-sample interaction is mediated by a
stretched water meniscus.

(elastic) spherical particles beyond the jammed state, using three-dimensional
non-smooth contact dynamic simulations. The assemblies of particles are
characterized using the evolution of the packing fraction, the coordination
number, and the von Misses stress distribution within the particles as the
confining stress increases. The packing fraction increases and tends toward a
maximum value close to $1$, and the mean coordination number increases as a
square root of the packing fraction. As the confining stress increases, a
transition is observed from a granular-like material with exponential tails of
the shear stress distributions to a continuous-like material characterized by
Gaussian-like distributions of the shear stresses. We develop an equation that
describes the evolution of the packing fraction as a function of the applied
pressure. This equation, based on the micromechanical expression of the
granular stress tensor, the limit of the Hertz contact law for small
deformation, and the power-law relation between the packing fraction and the
coordination of the particles, provides good predictions from the jamming point
up to very high densities without the need of tuning any parameters.

significantly boost the flowing mass and increase the final deposition extent.
The particle size of both the flowing material and the erodible substrate
influence the entrainment mechanism and determine the overall flow dynamics.
This paper examines these mechanisms experimentally by considering the flow of
particles over an erodible bed using different particle size combinations for
the incoming flow and the base layer in a laboratory-scale inclined flume.
Dynamic X-ray radiography was used to capture the dynamics of the flow-erodible
bed interface. The experiments found that the maximum downslope velocity
depends on the ratio between the size of the flowing particles and the size of
the bed particles, with higher ratios leading to faster velocities. Two
techniques were then applied to estimate the evolving erosion depth: an
established critical velocity method, and a novel particle-size-based method.
Erosion rates were estimated from both of these methods. Interestingly, these
two rates express different and contradictory conclusions. In the
critical-velocity-based rate estimation, the normalized erosion rate increases
with the flow to bed grain size ratio, whereas the erosion rates estimated from
the particle-size-based approach find the opposite trend. We rationalise this
discrepancy by considering the physical interpretation of both measurement
methods, and provide insight into how future modelling can be performed to
accommodate both of these complementary measures. This paper highlights how the
erosion rate is entirely dependent on the method of estimating the erosion
depth and the choice of measurement technique.

collisions are studied via the measurement of a multitude of strongly
interacting particles, called hadrons, that are emitted at the end of the
collision. However, also some photons are created. These photons are of special
interest as they allow to look into the early stage of the collisions, because
they are only very weakly (namely only electro-magnetically) interacting with
the hadrons of the created fireball. This paper elucidates the physics of the
