mixed graph with given minimum undirected and directed degrees; this is a
generalisation of the classical degree/girth problem. In this paper we present
new bounds on the order of mixed graphs with given diameter or geodetic girth

girth two and be totally regular, thereby proving an earlier conjecture of the

may encounter appearance deterioration, which introduces great confusion for
detection. One of the popular solutions is to exploit the temporal information
and enhance per-frame representation through aggregating features from
neighboring frames. Despite achieving improvements in detection, existing
methods focus on the selection of higher-level video frames for aggregation
rather than modeling lower-level temporal relations to increase the feature
representation. To address this limitation, we propose a novel solution named
TF-Blender,which includes three modules: 1) Temporal relation mod-els the
relations between the current frame and its neighboring frames to preserve
spatial information. 2). Feature adjustment enriches the representation of
every neigh-boring feature map; 3) Feature blender combines outputs from the
first two modules and produces stronger features for the later detection tasks.
For its simplicity, TF-Blender can be effortlessly plugged into any detection
network to improve detection behavior. Extensive evaluations on ImageNet VID
and YouTube-VIS benchmarks indicate the performance guarantees of using
TF-Blender on recent state-of-the-art methods.

training loss to become too small and the network to lose its adaptivity
(ability to move around) in the parameter space. Although regularization is
typically understood from an overfitting perspective, we highlight its role in
making the network more adaptive and enabling it to escape more easily from
weights that generalize poorly. To provide such a capability, we propose a
method called Logit Attenuating Weight Normalization (LAWN), that can be
stacked onto any gradient-based optimizer. LAWN controls the logits by
constraining the weight norms of layers in the final homogeneous sub-network.
Empirically, we show that the resulting LAWN variant of the optimizer makes a

the aggregate power consumption profile tracks a grid-supplied reference. At
the same time, each consumer's quality of service (QoS) must be maintained.
While there is a large body of work on TCL coordination, there are several
limitations. One is that they do not provide guarantees on the reference
tracking performance and QoS maintenance. A second limitation of past work is
that they do not provide a means to compute a suitable reference signal for
power demand of a collection of TCLs. In this work we provide a framework that
addresses these weaknesses. The framework enables coordination of an arbitrary
number of TCLs that: (i) is computationally efficient, (ii) is implementable at
the TCLs with local feedback and low communication, and (iii) enables reference
tracking by the collection while ensuring that temperature and cycling
constraints are satisfied at every TCL at all times. The framework is based on
a Markov model obtained by discretizing a pair of Fokker-Planck equations

to count formulas as maximal that are the conclusion of reductio and major

developers sometimes neglect or simply forget to remove the TODO comment,
resulting in obsolete TODO comments. These obsolete TODO comments can confuse
development teams and may cause the introduction of bugs in the future,
decreasing the software's quality and maintainability. In this work, we propose
a novel model, named TDCleaner (TODO comment Cleaner), to identify obsolete
TODO comments in software projects. TDCleaner can assist developers in
just-in-time checking of TODO comments status and avoid leaving obsolete TODO
comments. Our approach has two main stages: offline learning and online
prediction. During offline learning, we first automatically establish
<code_change, todo_comment, commit_msg> training samples and leverage three
neural encoders to capture the semantic features of TODO comment, code change
and commit message respectively. TDCleaner then automatically learns the
correlations and interactions between different encoders to estimate the final
status of the TODO comment. For online prediction, we check a TODO comment's
status by leveraging the offline trained model to judge the TODO comment's
likelihood of being obsolete. We built our dataset by collecting TODO comments
from the top-10,000 Python and Java Github repositories and evaluated TDCleaner
on them. Extensive experimental results show the promising performance of our
model over a set of benchmarks. We also performed an in-the-wild evaluation
with real-world software projects, we reported 18 obsolete TODO comments

and is the reason and resource behind several phenomena and technologies. It
depends on the natural basis in which the quantum state of the system is
expressed, which in turn hinges on the physical set-up being analyzed and
utilized. While quantum coherence has hitherto been conceptualized by employing
different categories of complete bases, there do exist interesting physical
situations, where the natural basis is an incomplete one, an example being an
interferometric set-up with the observer controlling only a certain fraction of
all the slits. We introduce a quantification of quantum coherence with respect
to an arbitrary incomplete basis for general quantum states, and develop the
corresponding resource theory, identifying the free states and operations.
Moreover, we obtain a complementarity relation between the so-defined quantum
coherence and the which-path information in an interferometric set-up with
several slits, of which only a section is in control of the observer or is
accessible to her. This therefore provides us with another face of the
wave-particle duality in quantum systems, demonstrating that the

comparisons are made with the Thomas-Fermi method and its accurate asymptotic
analytical solution, with close agreement found for the electron energy and

the behaviour of the LRC for some stellar associations with ages between 45 Myr

the general spin down stage for low mass stars, which starts at $\sim$ 30-40
Myr. We find that each stellar group presents a characteristic minimum lithium
(Li) depletion connected to a specific large rotation velocity and that this
minimum changes with age. For instance, this minimum changes from $\sim$ 50 km
s$^{-1}$ to less than 20 km s$^{-1}$ in 200 Myr. Regarding the lithium desert,
it was described as a limited region in the A(Li)-$T_{\rm eff}$ map containing

comprehension questions with relative success. However, this approach does not
ensure that the answer is a span in the given passage, nor does it guarantee
that it is the most probable one. Does greedy decoding actually perform worse
than an algorithm that does adhere to these properties? To study the
performance and optimality of greedy decoding, we present exact-extract, a
decoding algorithm that efficiently finds the most probable answer span in the
context. We compare the performance of T5 with both decoding algorithms on
zero-shot and few-shot extractive question answering. When no training examples
are available, exact-extract significantly outperforms greedy decoding.
However, greedy decoding quickly converges towards the performance of
exact-extract with the introduction of a few training examples, becoming more
extractive and increasingly likelier to generate the most probable span as the
training set grows. We also show that self-supervised training can bias the
model towards extractive behavior, increasing performance in the zero-shot
setting without resorting to annotated examples. Overall, our results suggest
that pretrained language models are so good at adapting to extractive question
answering, that it is often enough to fine-tune on a small training set for the
greedy algorithm to emulate the optimal decoding strategy.

Virgo detectors has allowed us to test general relativity, constrain merger
rates, and look for evidence of tidal effects, compact object spins, higher
waveform modes, and black hole ringdowns. An effect that has not yet been
confidently detected is binary eccentricity, which might be present in a small
fraction of binaries formed dynamically. Here we discuss general limits on
eccentricity that can, in-principle, be placed on all types of compact object
binaries by a detector operating at the design sensitivity of Advanced LIGO.
Using a post-Newtonian model for gravitational-wave phasing valid in the small
eccentricity regime, we assess the relative measurement error for eccentricity
for a variety of spinning and non-spinning binaries. Errors and correlations
involving the mass and spin parameters are also investigated. We find that
decreasing the low frequency limit of a detector's observational frequency band
is one of the key design factors for increasing the odds of measuring binary
eccentricity. We also introduce and analytically explore the eccentric chirp
mass parameter, which replaces the chirp mass as the key measurable parameter
combination in eccentric gravitational waveform models. The eccentric chirp
mass parameter explains a degeneracy between the chirp mass and the
eccentricity. This degeneracy leads to a bias in the standard chirp mass

m-RevNet, that is characterized by inserting momentum update to residual

vanilla residual networks, which potentially explains its performance gains.
For certain learning scenarios, we analytically and empirically reveal that our

and compare the results with their control samples matched in stellar mass,
redshift and local density. We find that the major interactions significantly
enhance the star formation rate in paired galaxies and turn them bluer with
decreasing pair separation within $30$ kpc. The impact of tidal interactions on
star formation rate and colour are more significant in the heavier members of
the major pairs. The star formation enhancement in major pairs is significantly
higher at the low-density environments, where the influence can extend up to
$\sim 100$ kpc. Contrarily, the major pairs at high-density environments show
suppression in their star formation. Depending on the embedding environments,
the major interactions in the intrinsically brighter galaxy pairs can thus
enhance or quench star formation. We find that the minor pairs at both
low-density and high-density environments are significantly less star-forming
and redder than their control galaxies. It indicates that the minor
interactions in intrinsically brighter galaxy pairs always suppress the star
formation irrespective of their environment. The lighter members in these minor
pairs show a greater susceptibility to suppressed star formation. Our results
imply that both the major and minor interactions can contribute to the observed
bimodality. We conclude that the galaxy evolution is determined by a complex

generation, it is still challenging to generate complex scenes containing
diverse, multiple objects and their interactions. Scene graphs, composed of
nodes as objects and directed-edges as relationships among objects, offer an
alternative representation of a scene that is more semantically grounded than
images. We hypothesize that a generative model for scene graphs might be able
to learn the underlying semantic structure of real-world scenes more
effectively than images, and hence, generate realistic novel scenes in the form
of scene graphs. In this work, we explore a new task for the unconditional
generation of semantic scene graphs. We develop a deep auto-regressive model
called SceneGraphGen which can directly learn the probability distribution over
labelled and directed graphs using a hierarchical recurrent architecture. The
model takes a seed object as input and generates a scene graph in a sequence of
steps, each step generating an object node, followed by a sequence of
relationship edges connecting to the previous nodes. We show that the scene
graphs generated by SceneGraphGen are diverse and follow the semantic patterns
of real-world scenes. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of the
generated graphs in image synthesis, anomaly detection and scene graph
completion.

compositional generalisation. Whether neural networks exhibit this ability is
usually studied by training models on highly compositional synthetic data.
However, compositionality in natural language is much more complex than the
rigid, arithmetic-like version such data adheres to, and artificial
compositionality tests thus do not allow us to determine how neural models deal
with more realistic forms of compositionality. In this work, we re-instantiate
three compositionality tests from the literature and reformulate them for
neural machine translation (NMT). Our results highlight that: i) unfavourably,
models trained on more data are more compositional; ii) models are sometimes
less compositional than expected, but sometimes more, exemplifying that
different levels of compositionality are required, and models are not always
able to modulate between them correctly; iii) some of the non-compositional
behaviours are mistakes, whereas others reflect the natural variation in data.
Apart from an empirical study, our work is a call to action: we should rethink
the evaluation of compositionality in neural networks and develop benchmarks
using real data to evaluate compositionality on natural language, where
composing meaning is not as straightforward as doing the math.

use-case specific visual understanding (e.g. skin tone classification) to
general representation learning for all visual content (e.g. embeddings for

replace the traditional convolutional backbone, with insights into both system

spatial structure of images and thus lacks interpretability. In this paper, we

metrics in a more human-friendly way, where the similarity of two images can be
decomposed to several part-wise similarities and their contributions to the
overall similarity. Our method is model-agnostic, which can be applied to
off-the-shelf backbone networks and metric learning methods. We evaluate our

superluminal signalling on the class of physically realisable quantum
operations, focusing on the difference in approaches one can take towards this
problem in Hilbert space quantum theory and algebraic quantum field theory
(AQFT). We review a recent proposal by Fewster and Verch for a generally
covariant measurement scheme in AQFT, which we call the FV scheme; along the
way, we argue that the framework as set up in its original proposal can be
greatly simplified without losing generality or physical motivation. We then
discuss the problem, introduced by Sorkin, that naive generalisations of the
notion of operation to the relativistic context can lead to signalling between
spacelike observers by introducing a third observer. We consider approaches to
tackle this problem in Hilbert space quantum theory and argue that these are
sometimes ambiguous, since the physical (im)possibility of operations depends
in part on the specific spacetime embodiment of the quantum system under
consideration, which lies outside the Hilbert space formalism. In the AQFT
context, we review and generalise a recent result showing that operations
induced by the FV measurement scheme do not enable superluminal signalling. We
connect this result to Hilbert space by introducing a concrete model of AQFT,
which we call the `hybrid model' as it provides a way to explicitly embed
Hilbert space quantum theory into spacetime using the formalism of AQFT.
Finally, we show that in this model, under suitable necessary and sufficient
conditions, the converse result also holds: every operation that does not
enable superluminal signalling can be implemented in the FV framework.

Floquet topological insulators, while also exhibiting novel phenomena due to
the non-unitary nature of the quantum measurements. We study in detail the

(2021)) to study instabilities of free surface films of nanometric thickness on
thermally conductive substrates in two and three spatial dimensions. While the
specific focus is on metal films exposed to laser heating, the model itself
applies to any setup involving films on the nanoscale whose material parameters
are temperature-dependent. For the particular case of metal films heated from
above, an important aspect is that the considered heating is volumetric, since
the absorption length of the applied laser pulse is comparable to the film
thickness. In such a setup, absorption of thermal energy and film evolution are
closely correlated and must be considered self-consistently. The asymptotic
model allows for a significant simplification, which is crucial from both
modeling and computational points of view, since it allows for asymptotically
correct averaging of the temperature over the film thickness. We find that the
properties of the thermally conductive substrate -- in particular its thickness
and rate of heat loss -- play a critical role in controlling the film
temperature and dynamics. The film evolution is simulated using efficient
GPU-based simulations which, when combined with the developed asymptotic model,
allow for fully nonlinear time-dependent simulations in large three-dimensional
computational domains. In addition to uncovering the role of the substrate and
its properties in determining the film evolution, one important finding is
that, at least for the considered range of material parameters, strong in-plane
thermal diffusion in the film results in negligible spatial variations of
temperature, and the film evolution is predominantly influenced by temporal
variation of film viscosity and surface tension (dictated by average film
temperature), as well as thermal conductivity of the substrate.

electrochemical systems. For example, reversible Na-ion intercalation - a
low-cost alternative to Li-ion technology - often induces detrimental
structural phase transformations coupled with charge compensation reactions.
However, little is known about the underpinning charge-structure mechanisms
because the reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions within coexisting structural
phases have so far eluded direct operando investigation. Here, we distinguish
x-ray spectra of individual crystalline phases operando during a redox-induced
phase transformation in P2-Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 - an archetypal layered oxide for
sodium-ion batteries. We measure the resonant elastic scattering on the Bragg
reflection corresponding to the P2-phase lattice spacing. These resonant
spectra become static midway through the sodium extraction in an operando coin
cell, while the overall sodium extraction proceeds as evidenced by the X-ray
absorption averaging over all electrochemically active Ni atoms. The stop of
redox activity in the P2-structure signifies its inability to host Ni4+ ions.
The coincident emergence of the O2- structure reveals the rigid link between
the local redox and the long-range order during the phase transformation. The
structure-selective x-ray spectroscopy thus opens a powerful avenue for
resolving the dynamic chemistry of different structural phases in multi-phase
electrochemical systems.

is no easier than k-SAT, and might be harder. Indeed, via simple reductions we
show NP-hardness for k=2 and W[1]-hardness parameterized by the co-dimension of

strong DDI and the emitter-cavity detuning can act together to achieve the CPA

reduction of the symmetry from $D_{2d}$ to $C_{2v}$ as imposed by asymmetry
along the growth direction. We report on reflectance anisotropy spectroscopy
(RAS) of double GaAs quantum wells (DQWs) structures coupled by a thin ($<2$
nm) tunneling barrier. Two groups of DQWs systems were studied: one where both
QWs have the same thickness (symmetric DQW) and another one where they have
different thicknesses (asymmetric DQW). RAS measures the IOAs arising from the
intermixing of the heavy- and light- holes in the valence band when the
symmetry of the DQW system is lowered from $D_{2d}$ to $C_{2v}$. If the DQW is
symmetric, residual IOAs stem from the asymmetry of the QW interfaces; for
instance, associated to Ga segregation into the AlGaAs layer during the
epitaxial growth process. In the case of an asymmetric DQW with QWs with
different thicknesses, the AlGaAs layers (that are sources of anisotropies) are
not distributed symmetrically at both sides of the tunneling barrier. Thus, the
system losses its inversion symmetry yielding an increase of the RAS strength.
The RAS line shapes were compared with reflectance spectra in order to assess
the heavy- and light- hole mixing induced by the symmetry breakdown. The

between Dirac and topological quantum spin liquids (QSLs): chiral and Z$_{2}$
QSLs. These quantum phase transitions are described by conformal field theories
(CFTs): quantum electrodynamics in 2+1 dimensions with 2N flavors of
two-component massless Dirac fermions and a four-fermion interaction. For the
transition to a chiral spin liquid, it is the Gross-Neveu interaction
(QED$_{3}$-GN), while for the transitions to Z$_{2}$ QSLs it is a
superconducting pairing term with general spin/valley structure (generalized
QED$_{3}$-Z$_{2}$GN). Using the state-operator correspondence, we obtain
monopole scaling dimensions to sub-leading order in 1/N. For monopoles with a
minimal topological charge q=1/2, the scaling dimension is 2N*0.26510 at
leading-order, with the quantum correction being 0.118911(7) for the chiral
spin liquid, and 0.102846(9) for the simplest Z$_{2}$ case (the expression is
also given for a general pairing term). Although these two anomalous dimensions
are nearly equal, the underlying quantum fluctuations possess distinct origins.
The analogous result in QED$_{3}$ is also obtained and we find a sub-leading
contribution of -0.038138(5), which differs slightly from the value first
obtained in the literature. The scaling dimension of a QED$_{3}$-GN monopole
with minimal charge is very close to the scaling dimensions of other operators
predicted to be equal by a conjectured duality between QED$_{3}$-GN with 2N=2
flavors and the CP$^{1}$ model. Additionally, non-minimally charged monopoles
on both sides of the duality have similar scaling dimensions. By studying the
large-q asymptotics of the scaling dimensions in QED$_{3}$, QED$_{3}$-GN, and
QED$_{3}$-Z$_{2}$GN we verify that the constant O(q$^{0}$) coefficient
precisely matches the universal non-perturbative prediction for CFTs with a
global U(1) symmetry.

of natural systems. Whether dynamical models are developed from
first-principles derivations or from observational data, they are predicated on
our choice of state variables. The choice of state variables is driven by
convenience and intuition, and in the data-driven case the observed variables
are often chosen to be the state variables. The dimensionality of these
variables (and consequently the dynamical models) can be arbitrarily large,
obscuring the underlying behavior of the system. In truth, these variables are
often highly redundant and the system is driven by a much smaller set of latent
intrinsic variables. In this study, we combine the mathematical theory of
manifolds with the representational capacity of neural networks to develop a
method that learns a system's intrinsic state variables directly from time
series data, and also learns predictive models for their dynamics. What
distinguishes our method is its ability to reduce data to the intrinsic
dimensionality of the nonlinear manifold they live on. This ability is enabled
by the concepts of charts and atlases from the theory of manifolds, whereby a
manifold is represented by a collection of patches that are sewn together -- a
necessary representation to attain intrinsic dimensionality. We demonstrate
this approach on several high-dimensional systems with low-dimensional
behavior. The resulting framework provides the ability to develop dynamical
models of the lowest possible dimension, capturing the essence of a system.

reflections can be removed from the cochlear implant stimulus. Artifacts can be
identified and removed by applying a matrix of gain values, a technique
referred to as time-frequency masking. Gain values are determined by an oracle
algorithm that uses knowledge of the undistorted signal to minimize retention
of the signal components dominated by reverberant reflections. In practice,
gain values are estimated from the distorted signal, with the oracle algorithm
providing the estimation objective. Different oracle techniques exist for
determining gain values, and each technique must be parameterized to set the
amount of signal retention. This work assesses which oracle masking strategies

remarkable variety of correlated phases including Wigner-crystals, Mott

and theoretical research has indicated that ferromagnetic phases can exist in
electronically-doped transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors, but
a stable magnetic state at zero magnetic field has eluded detection. Here, we
experimentally demonstrate that mesoscopic ferromagnetic order can be generated
and controlled by local optical pumping in monolayer WSe2 at zero applied
magnetic field. In a spatially resolved pump-probe experiment, we use
polarization-resolved reflectivity from excitonic states as a probe of
charge-carrier spin polarization. When the sample is electron-doped at density
$n_e = 10^{12} cm^{-2}$, we observe that a local, circularly-polarized,
microwatt-power optical pump breaks the symmetry between equivalent
ferromagnetic spin configurations and creates magnetic order which extends over
mesoscopic regions as large as 8 um x 5 um, bounded by sample edges and folds
in the 2D semiconductor. The experimental signature of magnetic order is
circular dichroism (CD) in reflectivity from the excitonic states, with
magnitude exceeding 20% at resonant wavelengths. The helicity of the pump
determines the orientation of the magnetic state, which can be aligned along
the two principle out-of-plane axes. In contrast to previous studies in 2D
materials that have required non-local, slowly varying magnetic fields to
manipulate magnetic phases, the demonstrated capability to control long-range
magnetism and corresponding strong CD with local and tunable optical pumps is
highly versatile. This discovery will unlock new TMD-based spin and optical

purity, a paradigmatic information-theoretic distinguishability measure that
finds applications ranging from quantum metrology to quantum speed limits.
First we obtain an upper bound on the average size of the fluctuations on the
relative purity: it depends on the effective dimension resembling the bound
obtained with the trace distance. Second, we investigate the dynamics of
relative purity and its rate of change as a probe of the speed of fluctuations
around the equilibrium. In turn, such speed captures the notion of how fast
some nonequilibrium state approaches the steady state under the local
nonunitary dynamics, somehow giving the information of the quantum speed limit
towards the equilibration. We show that the size of fluctuations depends on the
quantum coherences of the initial state with respect to the eigenbasis of the
Hamiltonian, also addressing the role played by the correlations between system
and reservoir into the averaged speed. Finally, we have derived a family of
lower bounds on the time of evolution between these states, thus obtaining an
estimate for the equilibration time at the local level. These results could be

of an open quantum system coupled to multiple environments, not necessarily at
equilibrium.
  Such a general theorem, when restricted to the weak-coupling and Markovian
regime, holds for both local and global master equations, corroborating the
thermodynamic consistency of local quantum master equations. The theorem is
genuinely quantum, as it can be expressed in terms of conservation of a
Hermitian operator, describing the dynamics of the system state operator and of
the entropy change in the baths. The integral fluctuation theorem follows from
the properties of such an operator. Furthermore, it is also valid when the
system is described by a time-dependent Hamiltonian. As such, the quantum
Jarzynski equality is a particular case of the general result presented here.
Moreover, our result can be extended to nonthermal baths, as long as
microreversibility is preserved. We present some numerical examples to showcase
the exact results previously obtained. We finally generalize the fluctuation
theorem to the case where the interaction between the system and the bath is
explicitly taken into account. We show that the fluctuation theorem amounts to
a relation between time-reversed dynamics of the global density matrix and a
two-time correlation function along the forward dynamics involving the baths'

associated growth invariants. When specialized to categories of geometric
interest, such as the wrapped Fukaya category of a Weinstein manifold, and the
bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on a smooth algebraic variety, our
categorical action filtrations essentially recover previously studied
filtrations of geometric origin.
  Our approach is built around the notion of a smooth categorical
compactification. We prove that a smooth categorical compactification induces
well-defined growth invariants, which are moreover preserved under zig-zags of
such compactifications. The technical heart of the paper is a method for
computing these growth invariants in terms of the growth of certain colimits of
(bi)modules. In practice, such colimits arise in both geometric settings of
interest.
  The main applications are: (1) A ""quantitative"" refinement of homological
mirror symmetry, which relates the growth of the Reeb-length filtration on the
symplectic geometry side with the growth of filtrations on the algebraic
geometry side defined by the order of pole at infinity (often these can be
expressed in terms of the dimension of the support of sheaves). (2) A proof
that the Reeb-length growth of symplectic cohomology and wrapped Floer
cohomology on a Weinstein manifold are at most exponential. (3) Lower bounds
for the entropy and polynomial entropy of certain natural endofunctors acting
on Fukaya categories.

  Forecasting",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ocean current, fluid mechanics, and many other spatio-temporal physical
dynamical systems are essential components of the universe. One key
characteristic of such systems is that certain physics laws -- represented as
ordinary/partial differential equations (ODEs/PDEs) -- largely dominate the
whole process, irrespective of time or location. Physics-informed learning has
recently emerged to learn physics for accurate prediction, but they often lack
a mechanism to leverage localized spatial and temporal correlation or rely on
hard-coded physics parameters. In this paper, we advocate a physics-coupled
neural network model to learn parameters governing the physics of the system,
and further couple the learned physics to assist the learning of recurring
dynamics. A spatio-temporal physics-coupled neural network (ST-PCNN) model is
proposed to achieve three goals: (1) learning the underlying physics
parameters, (2) transition of local information between spatio-temporal
regions, and (3) forecasting future values for the dynamical system. The
physics-coupled learning ensures that the proposed model can be tremendously
improved by using learned physics parameters, and can achieve good long-range
forecasting (e.g., more than 30-steps). Experiments, using simulated and
field-collected ocean current data, validate that ST-PCNN outperforms existing
physics-informed models.

ballot. Embedded in the evaluation of a party-candidate match is partisan
affect, a variable comprising the attitudes of voters towards the party.
Partisan affect may bias the electorate's appraisal of a match in a positive or

outsider and determine whether her introduction as a potential candidate has
any effect on the winning policy and on the welfare of voters. We find that the
victory of an outsider generally leads to policy polarization, and that

remnants (SNRs) has been attracting attention because its understanding
provides new insight into SNR evolution. However, the process of the
overionization, although it has been discussed in some RP-SNRs, is not yet
fully understood. Here we report on spatially resolved spectroscopy of X-ray
emission from IC~443 with {\it XMM-Newton}. We find that RPs in regions
interacting with dense molecular clouds tend to have lower electron temperature
and lower recombination timescale. These tendencies indicate that RPs in these
regions are cooler and more strongly overionized, which is naturally
interpreted as a result of rapid cooling by the molecular clouds via thermal
conduction. Our result on IC~443 is similar to that on W44 showing evidence for
thermal conduction as the origin of RPs at least in older remnants. We suggest
that evaporation of clumpy gas embedded in a hot plasma rapidly cools the
plasma as was also found in the W44 case. We also discuss if ionization by
protons accelerated in IC~443 is responsible for RPs. Based on the energetics
of particle acceleration, we conclude that the proton bombardment is unlikely
to explain the observed properties of RPs.

improves monotonically with the quantum circuit depth. Numerical analyses are

to demonstrate how student data combined with machine learning techniques can
predict how well a particular student will perform in a design task. We
challenged students to design a house that consumed zero net energy as part of
an introductory engineering technology undergraduate course. Using data from

line profile shape causes on the determination of the outflow speed of coronal
HI atoms. The Doppler dimming technique takes into account the decrease of
coronal Ly{\alpha} radiation in regions where HI atoms flow out in the solar
wind. Starting from UV observations (UVCS/SOHO) of the coronal Ly{\alpha} line
and simultaneous measurements of pB (LASCO/SOHO and Mk3/MLSO), we studied the
effect of the pumping chromospheric Ly{\alpha} line profile through
measurements from SOHO/SUMER, UVSP/SMM and LPSP/OSO-8, taken from
representative on-disk regions and as a function of time during the solar
activity cycle. In particular, we considered the effect of four chromospheric
line parameters: line width, depth of the central reversal, asymmetry and
distance of the peaks. We find that the range of variability of these
parameters is of about 50% for the width, 69% for the depth of the central
reversal, 35% for the asymmetry, and 50% for the distance of the peaks. Then,
we find that the variability of the pumping Ly{\alpha} profile affects the
estimates of the coronal HI velocity by about 9-12%. Therefore, this
uncertainty is smaller than other physical quantities uncertainties, and a
constant in time and unique shape of the Ly{\alpha} profile over the solar disk
can be adopted in order to estimate the solar wind outflow velocity.

ground state, resulting in a supercurrent sign reversal ($0-\pi$ transition).
In this work, we apply the exact time-dependent density matrix renormalization
group method to simulate the transient dynamics of such superconducting

phase-biased situation, the system gets trapped in a metastable state
characterized by a lower supercurrent compared to the equilibrium case. We show
that local Coulomb interactions do not provide an effective relaxation
mechanism for the initially trapped quasiparticles. In contrast, other
relaxation mechanisms, such as coupling to a third normal lead, make the
impurity spin relax for parameter values corresponding to the equilibrium $0$
phase. For parameters corresponding to the equilibrium $\pi$ phase the impurity
converges to a spin-polarized stationary state. Similar qualitative behavior is
found for a voltage-biased junction, which provides an effective relaxation
mechanism for the trapped quasiparticles in the junction.

antiferromagnetic order at TN = 8 K. Above TN the magnetic susceptibility is
isotropic. Curie-Weiss analysis suggests competing ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic interactions, with peff = 8.1 muB as expected for 4f7 J = S =
7/2 Eu^2+ ions. Below TN and at low applied magnetic fields, an anisotropy
develops linearly, reaching chi perpendicular over chi parallel =6 at T = 2 K.
There is concomitant metamagnetic behavior along with chi parallel, with a
magnetic field of mu0 H=0.5 T sufficient to suppress the anisotropy.
Independent of crystal orientation, there is a continuous evolution to a field
polarized paramagnetic state with M=7 muB/Eu^2+ cation at mu0 H=2 T as T
approaches 0 K. Specific heat measurements show a recovered magnetic entropy of
dSmag=16.4 J/mol.K from T near 0 K to T = TN, close to the expected value of
Rln(8) for an S = 7/2 ion, indicating negligible low dimensional spin
fluctuations above TN. We find no evidence of unusual behaviors arising either
from the dimensionality or the presence of the non-symmorphic symmetries.

  high-dimensional Bayesian optimization framework on supercomputers",,,,,"cs.DC cs.LG math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bayesian optimization (BO) is a flexible and powerful framework that is
suitable for computationally expensive simulation-based applications and
guarantees statistical convergence to the global optimum. While remaining as
one of the most popular optimization methods, its capability is hindered by the
size of data, the dimensionality of the considered problem, and the nature of
sequential optimization. These scalability issues are intertwined with each
other and must be tackled simultaneously. In this work, we propose the
Scalable$^3$-BO framework, which employs sparse GP as the underlying surrogate
model to scope with Big Data and is equipped with a random embedding to
efficiently optimize high-dimensional problems with low effective
dimensionality. The Scalable$^3$-BO framework is further leveraged with
asynchronous parallelization feature, which fully exploits the computational
resource on HPC within a computational budget. As a result, the proposed
Scalable$^3$-BO framework is scalable in three independent perspectives: with
respect to data size, dimensionality, and computational resource on HPC. The
goal of this work is to push the frontiers of BO beyond its well-known
scalability issues and minimize the wall-clock waiting time for optimizing
high-dimensional computationally expensive applications. We demonstrate the
capability of Scalable$^3$-BO with 1 million data points, 10,000-dimensional
problems, with 20 concurrent workers in an HPC environment.

materials for room-temperature thermoelectric applications. In numerous
studies, existing bulk phonon mean free path (MFP) spectra predicted by
atomistic simulations suggest sub-100 nm grain sizes are necessary to reduce
the lattice thermal conductivity by decreasing phonon MFPs. This is in contrast
with available experimental data, where a remarkable thermal conductivity
reduction is observed even for micro-grained Bi2Te3 samples. In this work,
first-principles phonon MFPs along both the in-plane and cross-plane directions
are re-computed for bulk Bi2Te3. These phonon MFPs can explain new and existing
experimental data on flake-like Bi2Te3 nanostructures with various thicknesses.
For polycrystalline Bi2Te3-based materials, a better explanation of the
experimental data requires further consideration of the grain-boundary thermal
resistance that can largely suppress the transport of high-frequency optical
phonons.

theory: they encode the ultimate limit for the sensitivity with which a set of

Moreover, the QFIM may be discontinuous, forcing one away from the paradigm of
regular statistical models. These questions of nonregular quantum statistical
models are present in both single- and multiparameter estimation.
Geometrically, singular QFIMs occur when the curvature of the metric vanishes

shift in the rate of change of Cognitive Abilities score over years, indicating
the existence of preclinical dementia. Here I will estimate the number of

observation is reported that calculates the mass of the Higgs boson with a 99.7
% agreement to its experimentally measured value. Particularly, motivated by
the desire to avoid infinities, a complex scalar finite field that aims to
describe the Higgs field is proposed as the underlying field of an extremely
huge finite group of Lie type. Then, the occurrence of a critical point of the
phase transition in that finite field is explained, and the mass of its bosons
is computed employing the Klein-Gordon equation. Next, in a backward analysis,
to curiously estimate magnificence of that finite group of Lie type, the mass
of Higgs boson is inputted to the obtained mass relation, and a huge order
close to the order of the Monster group is outputted. Supported by such a clue
as well as the fact that the Monster group is critical among the sporadic
groups, it is therefore assumed that the critical order of the corresponding
symmetry group (of Lie type), at which its underlying finite field reaches the
critical point of a phase transition, is the order of the Monster group. Based
on this assumption, the main observation is reported as M_H/M_P = D
m_(q^*)/m_2, where M_H, M_P, m_(q^*), m_2, and D, are respectively, the mass of
Higgs boson, the reduced Planck mass, the mass of bosons of the finite field,
the mass of field with two elements, and the number of spatial dimensions which
perfectly match the central charge (i.e., number of degrees of freedom) in the
Monster conformal field theory.

imaging. Direct imaging is challenging because of the small angular separations
($<1$ arcsec) and high star-to-planet flux ratios (${\sim}10^{9}$ for a Jupiter
analog or ${\sim}10^{10}$ for an Earth analog in the visible). Atmospheric
turbulence prohibits reaching such high flux ratios on the ground, so
observations must be made above the Earth's atmosphere. The Nancy Grace Roman
Space Telescope (Roman), set to launch in the mid-2020s, will be the first
space-based observatory to demonstrate high-contrast imaging with active
wavefront control using its Coronagraph Instrument. The instrument's main
purpose is to mature the various technologies needed for a future flagship
mission to image and characterize Earth-like exoplanets. These technologies
include two high-actuator-count deformable mirrors, photon-counting detectors,
two complementary wavefront sensing and control loops, and two different
coronagraph types. In this paper, we describe the complete set of flight
coronagraph mask designs and their intended combinations in the Roman
Coronagraph Instrument. There are three types of mask configurations included:
a primary one designed to meet the instrument's top-level requirement, three
that are supported on a best-effort basis, and several unsupported ones
contributed by the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program. The unsupported mask
configurations could be commissioned and used if the instrument is approved for
operations after its initial technology demonstration phase.

from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Previous work is
mainly built upon convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn
domain-invariant representations. With the recent exponential increase in
applying Vision Transformer (ViT) to vision tasks, the capability of ViT in
adapting cross-domain knowledge, however, remains unexplored in the literature.
To fill this gap, this paper first comprehensively investigates the
transferability of ViT on a variety of domain adaptation tasks. Surprisingly,
ViT demonstrates superior transferability over its CNNs-based counterparts with
a large margin, while the performance can be further improved by incorporating
adversarial adaptation. Notwithstanding, directly using CNNs-based adaptation
strategies fails to take the advantage of ViT's intrinsic merits (e.g.,
attention mechanism and sequential image representation) which play an
important role in knowledge transfer. To remedy this, we propose an unified
framework, namely Transferable Vision Transformer (TVT), to fully exploit the
transferability of ViT for domain adaptation. Specifically, we delicately
devise a novel and effective unit, which we term Transferability Adaption
Module (TAM). By injecting learned transferabilities into attention blocks, TAM
compels ViT focus on both transferable and discriminative features. Besides, we
leverage discriminative clustering to enhance feature diversity and separation
which are undermined during adversarial domain alignment. To verify its
versatility, we perform extensive studies of TVT on four benchmarks and the
experimental results demonstrate that TVT attains significant improvements
compared to existing state-of-the-art UDA methods.

build the graphical element to represent the system, the source code has been
studied to find out different software metrics. For experimentation, several

Henceforth, this tool will surely increase the work efficiency of both the

is essential for real-time Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. On the other
hand, energy saving is urgently required by many energy-constrained IoT
devices. This paper studies the energy-age tradeoff for status update from a
sensor to a monitor over an error-prone channel. The sensor can sleep, sense
and transmit a new update, or retransmit by considering both sensing energy and
transmit energy. An infinite-horizon average cost problem is formulated as a
Markov decision process (MDP) with the objective of minimizing the weighted sum
of average AoI and average energy consumption. By solving the associated
discounted cost problem and analyzing the Markov chain under the optimal
policy, we prove that there exists a threshold optimal stationary policy with
only two thresholds, i.e., one threshold on the AoI at the transmitter (AoIT)
and the other on the AoI at the receiver (AoIR). Moreover, the two thresholds
can be efficiently found by a line search. Numerical results show the
performance of the optimal policies and the tradeoff curves with different
parameters. Comparisons with the conventional policies show that considering
sensing energy is of significant impact on the policy design, and introducing
sleep mode greatly expands the tradeoff range.

we propose an image-free method to achieve real-time detection and tracking of

fast-moving object by a spatial light modulator, in which the resulting light
signal is collected by a single-pixel detector. The single-pixel measurement

a 1.28% sampling rate when tracked. Our method breaks through the traditional
tracking ways, which can implement the object real-time tracking without image

its large magnetic moment. Our systematic Fe deposition and subsequent

they are fragile to carefully designed adversarial attacks. We propose a novel
adversarial training-based model by Attention Guided Knowledge Distillation and
Bi-directional Metric Learning (AGKD-BML). The attention knowledge is obtained
from a weight-fixed model trained on a clean dataset, referred to as a teacher
model, and transferred to a model that is under training on adversarial
examples (AEs), referred to as a student model. In this way, the student model
is able to focus on the correct region, as well as correcting the intermediate
features corrupted by AEs to eventually improve the model accuracy. Moreover,
to efficiently regularize the representation in feature space, we propose a
bidirectional metric learning. Specifically, given a clean image, it is first
attacked to its most confusing class to get the forward AE. A clean image in
the most confusing class is then randomly picked and attacked back to the
original class to get the backward AE. A triplet loss is then used to shorten
the representation distance between original image and its AE, while enlarge
that between the forward and backward AEs. We conduct extensive adversarial
robustness experiments on two widely used datasets with different attacks. Our
proposed AGKD-BML model consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art
approaches. The code of AGKD-BML will be available at:

(TIN). Interestingly, it is shown that there exists an asymptotic scheme,
called Han-Kobayashi scheme, that performs better than TD and TIN. However,
Han-Kobayashi scheme has impractically high complexity and is designed for
asymptotic settings, which leads to a gap between information theory and
practice.
  In this paper, we focus on designing practical codes for interference
channels. As it is challenging to analytically design practical codes with
feasible complexity, we apply deep learning to learn codes for interference
channels. We demonstrate that DeepIC, a convolutional neural network-based code
with an iterative decoder, outperforms TD and TIN by a significant margin for
two-user additive white Gaussian noise channels with moderate amount of
interference.

field. A distinct characteristic in vehicle tracking is that the trajectories
of vehicles are fairly smooth in both the world coordinate and the image
coordinate. Hence, models that capture motion consistencies are of high
necessity. However, tracking with the standalone motion-based trackers is quite
challenging because targets could get lost easily due to limited information,
detection error and occlusion. Leveraging appearance information to assist
object re-identification could resolve this challenge to some extent. However,
doing so requires extra computation while appearance information is sensitive
to occlusion as well. In this paper, we try to explore the significance of
motion patterns for vehicle tracking without appearance information. We propose
a novel approach that tackles the association issue for long-term tracking with
the exclusive fully-exploited motion information. We address the tracklet
embedding issue with the proposed reconstruct-to-embed strategy based on deep
graph convolutional neural networks (GCN). Comprehensive experiments on the
KITTI-car tracking dataset and UA-Detrac dataset show that the proposed method,
though without appearance information, could achieve competitive performance
with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) trackers. The source code will be available at

ferroelectric materials underpin an extremely broad spectrum of applications
ranging from domain wall electronics to high dielectric and electromechanical

probe microscopy methods. However, the search for these functionalities has
until now been based by either trial and error or using auxiliary information

interest based on the intuition of operator or preexisting hypotheses, with
subsequent manual exploration. Here, we report the development and
implementation of a machine learning framework that actively discovers
relationships between local domain structure and polarization switching
characteristics in ferroelectric materials encoded in the hysteresis loop. The
latter and descriptors such as nucleation bias, coercive bias, hysteresis loop
area, or more complex functionals of hysteresis loop shape and corresponding

the power of machine learning methods to learn the correlative relationships
between high dimensional data, and human-based physics insights encoded in the

that the discovery path and sampling points of on-field and off-field
hysteresis loops are largely different, indicating the on-field and off-field
hysteresis loops are dominated by different mechanisms. The proposed approach
is universal and can be applied to a broad range of modern imaging and
spectroscopy methods ranging from other scanning probe microscopy modalities to

capturing local evidence in graphs. In this paper, we introduce a novel
relational structure, i.e., relational directed graph (r-digraph), which is
composed of overlapped relational paths, to capture the KG's local evidence.
Since the r- digraphs are more complex than paths, how to efficiently construct
and effectively learn from them are challenging. Directly encoding the
r-digraphs cannot scale well and capturing query-dependent information is hard
in r-digraphs. We propose a variant of graph neural network, i.e., RED-GNN, to
address the above challenges. Specifically, RED-GNN makes use of dynamic
programming to recursively encodes multiple r-digraphs with shared edges, and
utilizes a query-dependent attention mechanism to select the strongly
correlated edges. We demonstrate that RED-GNN is not only efficient but also
can achieve significant performance gains in both inductive and transductive
reasoning tasks over existing methods. Besides, the learned attention weights
in RED-GNN can exhibit interpretable evidence for KG reasoning.

spectroscopy of atoms in a non-vortex but delocalized state. Even for
monochromatic twisted photons and for an infinitely narrow line, absorption
will occur over a finite range of detuning. Inside this range, a rapidly
varying absorption probability is predicted, revealing interference fringes
induced by two distinct paths leading to the same final state. The number,

indicate that $L$ and $H$ are relatively insensitive to both the wind speed and
grain diameter $d$. The latter result is currently unexplained and contradicts
the theoretical prediction $L\propto H\propto d$. This prediction is based on
the assumption that the characteristic velocity $\sqrt{\tilde gd}$ of bed
grains ejected by the splash of an impacting grain controls the average
saltation kinematics. Here, we show that a recent analytical saltation model
that considers only rebounds of saltating grains, but neglects splash ejection,
is consistent with the measurements. The model suggests that the buffer layer
of the inner turbulent boundary layer, which connects the viscous sublayer with
the log-layer, is partially responsible for the insensitivity of $L$ and $H$ to
$d$. In combination, the measurements and model therefore indicate that splash
ejection, though important to sustain saltation, does not significantly affect
the average saltation kinematics. This finding represents a strong argument
against the Ungar and Haff (1987)-scaling and in favor of the Dur\'an et al.
(2011)-scaling of the saturated saltation mass flux, with implications for
ripple formation on Mars. Furthermore, it supports the recent controversial
claim that this flux is insensitive to soil cohesion.

limitations of generic local algorithms including QAOA on random instances of
constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Specifically, we show that any generic
local algorithm whose assignment to a vertex depends only on a local
neighborhood with $o(n)$ other vertices (such as the QAOA at depth less than
$\epsilon\log(n)$) cannot arbitrarily-well approximate boolean CSPs if the
problem satisfies a geometric property from statistical physics called the
coupled overlap-gap property (OGP) [Chen et al., Annals of Probability, 47(3),

  Our concentration lemmas confirm a conjecture of Brandao et al.
[arXiv:1812.04170, 2018] asserting that the landscape independence of QAOA
extends to logarithmic depth -- in other words, for every fixed choice of QAOA
angle parameters, the algorithm at logarithmic depth performs almost equally
well on almost all instances. One of these concentration lemmas is a
strengthening of McDiarmid's inequality, applicable when the random variables
have a highly biased distribution, and may be of independent interest.

search and tracking applications. In recent years, deep learning techniques
were introduced to this task and achieved noteworthy effects. Following general
object segmentation methods, existing deep learning methods usually processed
the image from the global view. However, the imaging locality of small targets
and extreme class-imbalance between the target and background pixels were not
well-considered by these deep learning methods, which causes the low-efficiency
on training and high-dependence on numerous data. A local patch network (LPNet)
with global attention is proposed in this paper to detect small targets by
jointly considering the global and local properties of infrared small target
images. From the global view, a supervised attention module trained by the
small target spread map is proposed to suppress most background pixels
irrelevant with small target features. From the local view, local patches are
split from global features and share the same convolution weights with each
other in a patch net. By leveraging both the global and local properties, the
data-driven framework proposed in this paper has fused multi-scale features for
small target detection. Extensive synthetic and real data experiments show that
the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared with
existing both conventional and deep learning methods.

Fr\'echet means can be used to define the Fr\'echet regression function. Global

M-estimation to estimate both the coefficient vector and the underlying

practical viability by restricting attention to a further specialization,
dual-curve services, which turn out to be dynamic extensions of service curves.

predicting force field and molecular potential, to overcome the computational
bottleneck of molecular dynamics simulation. Integrating both atomic force and
energy in predictions was found to be more accurate than using energy alone,
yet it requires $O((NM)^3)$ computational operations for computing the
likelihood function and making predictions, where $N$ is the number of atoms
and $M$ is the number of simulated configurations in the training sample, due
to the inversion of a large covariance matrix. The large computational need
limits its applications to emulating simulation of small molecules. The
computational challenge of using both gradient information and function values
in GPs was recently noticed in statistics and machine learning communities,
where conventional approximation methods, such as the low rank decomposition or
sparse approximation, may not work well. Here we introduce a new approach, the
atomized force field (AFF) model, that integrates both force and energy in the
emulator with many fewer computational operations. The drastic reduction on
computation is achieved by utilizing the naturally sparse structure of the
covariance satisfying the constraints of the energy conservation and
permutation symmetry of atoms. The efficient machine learning algorithm extends
the limits of its applications on larger molecules under the same computational
budget, with nearly no loss of predictive accuracy. Furthermore, our approach
contains uncertainty assessment of predictions of atomic forces and potentials,
useful for developing a sequential design over the chemical input space, with
almost no increase in computational cost.

Remarkably, the colony size of HER2+ cells emerging from a single HER2- cell

with experimental results, without tweaking any parameter in the model. The
theory quantitatively explains experimental data on the responses of breast
cancer tumor under different treatment protocols. We then used the model to
predict that, not only the order of two drugs, but also the treatment period

Moreover, a TDM-based algorithm is introduced to demonstrate the unification of

stability-efficiency dilemma: increasing the batch sizes and learning rates
leads to better training efficiency but can also result in training
instability, leading to poor generalization accuracy or failed runs. To better
understand this phenomenon, we conduct an in-depth analysis on large-scale
pre-training experiments replicating the GPT-2 model. We find that there is a
strong correlation between training instability and extreme values of gradient
variance, and that samples with long sequence lengths contribute to these
extreme gradient variance values, especially at the beginning of the training,
indicating that long sequence length can be a main source of training
instability. Based on the analysis, we present a Sequence Length Warmup method

of mobile devices. In this study, a novel vertical-cavity surface-emitting
laser (VCSEL) array is proposed for indoor OWC systems. To activate the best
beam for a mobile user, two beam activation methods are proposed for the
system. The method based on a corner-cube retroreflector (CCR) provides very
low latency and allows real-time activation for high-speed users. The other
method uses the omnidirectional transmitter (ODTx). The ODTx can serve the
purpose of uplink transmission and beam activation simultaneously. Moreover,
systems with ODTx are very robust to the random orientation of a user equipment
(UE). System level analyses are carried out for the proposed VCSEL array
system. For a single user scenario, the probability density function (PDF) of
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the central beam of the VCSEL array system
can be approximated as a uniform distribution. In addition, the average data
rate of the central beam and its upper bound are given analytically and
verified by Monte-Carlo simulations. For a multi-user scenario, an analytical
upper bound for the average data rate is given. The effects of the cell size
and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) angle on the system performance are
studied. The results show that the system with a FWHM angle of $4^\circ$
outperforms the others.

decomposition algorithm based on graph peeling and Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
that is capable of handling very large graphs. Their proposed peeling algorithm
(PA) starts from the lowest degree vertices and recursively deletes these
vertices, assigning core numbers, and updating the degree of neighbour vertices
until it reached the maximum core. However, in many applications, particularly
in biology, more valuable information can be obtained from dense
sub-communities and we are not interested in small cores where vertices do not
interact much with others. To make the previous PA focus more on dense
subgraphs, we propose a multi-stage graph peeling algorithm (M-PA) that has a
two-stage data screening procedure added before the previous PA. After removing
vertices from the graph based on the user-defined thresholds, we can reduce the
graph complexity largely and without affecting the vertices in subgraphs that
we are interested in. We show that M-PA is more efficient than the previous PA
and with the properly set filtering threshold, can produce very similar if not
identical dense subgraphs to the previous PA (in terms of graph density and
clustering coefficient).

navigates with a goal image rather than accurate target information, which is

modules. The first module maintains an obstacle map during robot navigation.
The second predicts a long-term goal on the real-time map periodically, which
can thus convert an image-goal navigation task to several point-goal navigation
tasks. To achieve these point-goal navigation tasks, the third module plans
collision-free command sets for navigating to these long-term goals. The final

of aspect terms, their associated sentiments, and the opinion terms that
provide evidence for the expressed sentiments. Previous approaches to ASTE
usually simultaneously extract all three components or first identify the
aspect and opinion terms, then pair them up to predict their sentiment
polarities. In this work, we present a novel paradigm, ASTE-RL, by regarding
the aspect and opinion terms as arguments of the expressed sentiment in a
hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) framework. We first focus on
sentiments expressed in a sentence, then identify the target aspect and opinion
terms for that sentiment. This takes into account the mutual interactions among
the triplet's components while improving exploration and sample efficiency.
Furthermore, this hierarchical RLsetup enables us to deal with multiple and
overlapping triplets. In our experiments, we evaluate our model on existing
datasets from laptop and restaurant domains and show that it achieves
state-of-the-art performance. The implementation of this work is publicly

method in a parallel manner. As the existing distributed power method is
usually sequentially updating the eigenvectors, it exhibits two obvious
disadvantages: 1) when it calculates the $h$th eigenvector, it needs to wait
for the results of previous $(h-1)$ eigenvectors, which causes a delay in
acquiring all the eigenvalues; 2) when calculating each eigenvector, it needs a
certain cost of information exchange within the neighboring nodes for every
power iteration, which could be unbearable when the number of eigenvectors or
the number of nodes is large. This motivates us to propose a parallel
distributed power method, which simultaneously calculates all the eigenvectors
at each power iteration to ensure that more information could be exchanged in
one shaking-hand of communication. We are particularly interested in the
distributed power method for both an eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) and a
singular value decomposition (SVD), wherein the distributed process is proceed
based on a gossip algorithm. It can be shown that, under the same condition,
the communication cost of the gossip-based parallel method is only $1/H$ times
of that for the sequential counterpart, where $H$ is the number of eigenvectors
we want to compute, while the convergence time and error performance of the
proposed parallel method are both comparable to those of its sequential
counterpart.

computing (WP-MEC) system is conceived, where each device's computational task
can be divided into two parts for local computing and offloading to mobile edge
computing (MEC) servers, respectively. Both time division multiple access
(TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes are considered for
uplink (UL) offloading. Given the capability of IRSs in intelligently
reconfiguring wireless channels over time, it is fundamentally unknown which
multiple access scheme is superior for MEC UL offloading. To answer this
question, we first investigate the impact of three different dynamic IRS
beamforming (DIBF) schemes on the computation rate of both offloading schemes,
based on the flexibility for the IRS in adjusting its beamforming (BF) vector
in each transmission frame. Under the DIBF framework, computation rate
maximization problems are formulated for both the NOMA and TDMA schemes,
respectively, by jointly optimizing the IRS passive BF and the resource
allocation. We rigorously prove that offloading adopting TDMA can achieve the
same computation rate as that of NOMA, when all the devices share the same IRS
BF vector during the UL offloading. By contrast, offloading exploiting TDMA
outperforms NOMA, when the IRS BF vector can be flexibly adapted for UL
offloading. Despite the non-convexity of the computation rate maximization
problems for each DIBF scheme associated with highly coupled optimization
variables, we conceive computationally efficient algorithms by invoking
alternating optimization. Our numerical results demonstrate the significant
performance gains achieved by the proposed designs over various benchmark
schemes.

commonly referred to as the ""Standard Model"" (SM) of non-exchanging anisotropic
Gaussian compartments. In this work, we focus on diffusion MRI in gray matter,
which requires rethinking basic microstructure modeling blocks. In particular,
at least three contributions beyond the SM need to be considered: water
exchange across the cell membrane - between neurites and the extracellular
space; non-Gaussian diffusion along neuronal and glial processes - resulting
from structural disorder; and signal contribution from soma. For the first
contribution, we propose Neurite Exchange Imaging (NEXI) as an extension of the
SM of diffusion, which builds on the anisotropic K\""arger model of two
exchanging compartments. Using datasets acquired at multiple diffusion
weightings (b) and diffusion times (t) in the rat brain in vivo, we show that
for the investigated diffusion time window (~10-45 ms) there is minimal
diffusivity time-dependence and more pronounced kurtosis decay with time in
gray matter, which is well fit by the exchange model. Moreover, we observe
lower signal for longer diffusion times at high b. In light of these
observations, we identify exchange as the mechanism that best explains these
signal signatures in both low-b and high-b regime, and thereby propose NEXI as
the minimal model for gray matter microstructure mapping. We finally highlight
multi-b multi-t acquisitions protocols as being best suited to estimate NEXI
model parameters reliably. Using this approach, we estimate the
inter-compartment water exchange time to be 15 - 60 ms in the rat cortex and
hippocampus in vivo, which is of the same order or shorter than the diffusion
time in typical diffusion MRI acquisitions. This suggests water exchange as an
essential component for interpreting diffusion MRI measurements in gray matter.

general case even for free systems when the finite system in question is
composed of several disjoint intervals. Here we develop a mathematical
framework based on the Riemann-Hilbert approach to treat this problem in the
one-dimensional case where the finite system is composed of two disjoint
intervals and in the thermodynamic limit (both intervals and the space between
them contains an infinite number of lattice sites and the result is given as a
thermodynamic expansion). To demonstrate the usefulness of our method, we
compute the change in the entanglement and negativity namely the spectrum of
eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix with our without time reversal of one
of the intervals. We do this in the case that the distance between the
intervals is much larger than their size. The method we use can be easily
applied to compute any power in an expansion in the ratio of the distance
between the intervals to their size. {We expect these results to provide the
necessary mathematical apparatus to address relevant questions in concrete
physical scenarios, namely the structure and extent of quantum correlations in
fermionic systems subject to local environment.

of twisted graphene and monolayers of transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs)
MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and WSe$_2$ from first principles. We identify
strain, which is necessary to define commensurate supercells, as the key factor
affecting the band offsets and thus magnitudes of the proximity couplings. We
establish that for biaxially strained graphene the band offsets between the
Dirac point and conduction (valence) TMDC bands vary linearly with strain,
regardless of the twist angle. This relation allows to identify the apparent
zero-strain band offsets and find a compensating transverse electric field
correcting for the strain. The resulting corrected band structure is then
fitted around the Dirac point to an established spin-orbit Hamiltonian. This
procedure yields the dominant, valley-Zeeman and Rashba spin-orbit couplings.
The magnitudes of these couplings do not vary much with the twist angle,
although the valley-Zeeman coupling vanishes for 30$^{\circ}$ and Mo-based
heterostructures exhibit a maximum of the coupling at around 20$^{\circ}$. The
maximum for W-based stacks is at 0$^{\circ}$. The Rashba coupling is in general
weaker than the valley-Zeeman coupling, except at angles close to 30$^{\circ}$.
We also identify the Rashba phase angle which measures the deviation of the
in-plane spin texture from tangential, and find that this angle is very
sensitive to the applied transverse electric field. We further discuss the
reliability of the supercell approach with respect to atomic relaxation
(rippling of graphene), relative lateral shifts of the atomic layers, and
transverse electric field.

of relevance to the Internet of Things (IoT), such as computer vision and
machine listening. These technologies must ultimately be brought directly to
the edge to fully harness the power of deep learning for the IoT. The obvious
challenge is that deep learning techniques can only be implemented on strictly
resource-constrained edge devices if the models are radically downsized. This
task relies on different model compression techniques, such as network pruning,
quantization, and the recent advancement of XNOR-Net. This study examines the
suitability of these techniques for audio classification on microcontrollers.
We present an application of XNOR-Net for end-to-end raw audio classification
and a comprehensive empirical study comparing this approach with
pruning-and-quantization methods. We show that raw audio classification with
XNOR yields comparable performance to regular full precision networks for small
numbers of classes while reducing memory requirements 32-fold and computation
requirements 58-fold. However, as the number of classes increases
significantly, performance degrades, and pruning-and-quantization based
compression techniques take over as the preferred technique being able to
satisfy the same space constraints but requiring approximately 8x more
computation. We show that these insights are consistent between raw audio
classification and image classification using standard benchmark sets. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply XNOR to end-to-end
audio classification and evaluate it in the context of alternative techniques.

a labeled source domain to an unlabeled domain under the distribution shift.
Thanks to the strong representation ability of deep neural networks, recent
remarkable achievements in UDA resort to learning domain-invariant features.
Intuitively, the hope is that a good feature representation, together with the
hypothesis learned from the source domain, can generalize well to the target
domain. However, the learning processes of domain-invariant features and source
hypothesis inevitably involve domain-specific information that would degrade
the generalizability of UDA models on the target domain. In this paper,
motivated by the lottery ticket hypothesis that only partial parameters are
essential for generalization, we find that only partial parameters are
essential for learning domain-invariant information and generalizing well in
UDA. Such parameters are termed transferable parameters. In contrast, the other
parameters tend to fit domain-specific details and often fail to generalize,
which we term as untransferable parameters. Driven by this insight, we propose
Transferable Parameter Learning (TransPar) to reduce the side effect brought by
domain-specific information in the learning process and thus enhance the
memorization of domain-invariant information. Specifically, according to the
distribution discrepancy degree, we divide all parameters into transferable and
untransferable ones in each training iteration. We then perform separate
updates rules for the two types of parameters. Extensive experiments on image
classification and regression tasks (keypoint detection) show that TransPar
outperforms prior arts by non-trivial margins. Moreover, experiments
demonstrate that TransPar can be integrated into the most popular deep UDA
networks and be easily extended to handle any data distribution shift
scenarios.

This underestimation of the true performance of models hinders user acceptance
in applications and complicates a fair comparison of different models.
Therefore, there is a need for an evaluation metric that is based on semantics
instead of pure string similarity. In this short paper, we present SAS, a
cross-encoder-based metric for the estimation of semantic answer similarity,
and compare it to seven existing metrics. To this end, we create an English and
a German three-way annotated evaluation dataset containing pairs of answers
along with human judgment of their semantic similarity, which we release along

semantic similarity metrics based on recent transformer models correlate much

not been studied before, the asymmetry of interevent time series (e.g.,
reflecting the tendency to have more aftershocks than spontaneous earthquakes).
We define the asymmetry metric as the ratio between the number of positive
interevent time increments minus negative increments and the total (positive
plus negative) number of increments. Such asymmetry commonly exists in time
series data for non-linear geophysical systems like river flow which decays
slowly and increases rapidly. We find that earthquake interevent time series
are significantly asymmetric, where the asymmetry function exhibits a
significant crossover to weak asymmetry at large lag-index. We suggest that the
Omori law can be associated with the large asymmetry at short time intervals
below the crossover whereas overlapping aftershock sequences and the
spontaneous events can be associated with a fast decay of asymmetry above the
crossover. We show that the asymmetry is better reproduced by a recently
modified ETAS model with two triggering processes in comparison to the standard
ETAS model which only has one.

Unfortunately, the lack of ground-truths to be used as guidance for an
objective evaluation has pushed the community to resort to two approaches which
can also be jointly applied. Hence, two kinds of indexes can be found in the
literature: i) reference-based reduced-resolution indexes aimed to assess the
synthesis ability; ii) no-reference subjective quality indexes for
full-resolution datasets aimed to assess spectral and spatial consistency. Both
reference-based and no-reference indexes present critical shortcomings which
motivate the community to explore new solutions. In this work, we propose an
alternative no-reference full-resolution assessment framework. On one side we
introduce a protocol, namely the reprojection protocol, to take care of the
spectral consistency issue. On the other side, a new index of the spatial
consistency between the pansharpened image and the panchromatic band at full
resolution is also proposed. Experimental results carried out on different
datasets/sensors demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Trojan Horse Method (THM) by measuring the 2H(27Al,a24Mg)n three-body reaction.
The experiment covered a broad energy range (-0.5 MeV < E_cm < 1.5 MeV), aiming
to investigate those of interest for astrophysics.The results confirm the THM
as a valuable technique for the experimental study of fusion reactions at very
low energies and suggest the presence of a rich pattern of resonances in the
energy region close to the Gamow window of stellar hydrogen burning (70-120

second run of the experiment is needed, since the background due the three-body

Here we demonstrate that dissolution of spin-polarized pentacene-doped

fields (1.45$\,$T). This makes it possible to exploit the high spin
polarization of optically polarized crystals while mitigating the challenges of
its transfer to external nuclei, particularly of the large distances and
prohibitively weak coupling between source and target nuclei across solid-solid

dynamics for target $^1$H nuclei. Although the spectra are radiation damped due
to the high naphthalene magnetization, we describe a procedure to process the

nuclei polarization. With the entire process occurring on a timescale of one

state $|\psi_v\rangle =\sum_{k=0}^{2^n-1}v_k|k\rangle$ from the initial state
$|0\rangle^{\otimes n}$, for a given unit vector
$v=(v_0,v_1,v_2,\ldots,v_{2^n-1})^T\in \mathbb{C}^{2^n}$ with $\|v\|_2 = 1$.
The problem is of fundamental importance in quantum algorithm design,
Hamiltonian simulation and quantum machine learning, yet its circuit depth and
size complexity remain open when ancillary qubits are available. In this paper,
we study efficient constructions of quantum circuits with $m$ ancillary qubits
that can prepare $|\psi_v\rangle$ in depth $\tilde
O\left(\frac{2^n}{m+n}+n\right)$and size $O(2^n)$, achieving the optimal value
for both measures simultaneously. These results also imply a depth complexity
of $\Theta(4^n/(m+n))$ for quantum circuits implementing a general $n$-qubit
unitary using $m = O(2^n/n)$ ancillary qubits. This resolves the depth
complexity for circuits without ancillary qubits, and for circuits with
exponentially many ancillary qubits, this gives a quadratic saving from
$O(4^n)$ to $\tilde \Theta(2^n)$. Our circuits are deterministic, prepare the
state and carry out the unitary precisely, utilize the ancillary qubits tightly
and the depths are optimal in a wide range of parameter regime. The results can
be viewed as (optimal) time-space tradeoff bounds, which is not only
theoretically interesting, but also practically relevant in the current trend
that the number of qubits starts to take off, by showing a way to use a large
number of qubits to compensate the short qubit lifetime.

decoder architecture to object detection and achieves promising performance. In
this paper, we handle the critical issue, slow training convergence, and
present a conditional cross-attention mechanism for fast DETR training. Our
approach is motivated by that the cross-attention in DETR relies highly on the
content embeddings for localizing the four extremities and predicting the box,
which increases the need for high-quality content embeddings and thus the
training difficulty. Our approach, named conditional DETR, learns a conditional
spatial query from the decoder embedding for decoder multi-head
cross-attention. The benefit is that through the conditional spatial query,
each cross-attention head is able to attend to a band containing a distinct
region, e.g., one object extremity or a region inside the object box. This
narrows down the spatial range for localizing the distinct regions for object
classification and box regression, thus relaxing the dependence on the content
embeddings and easing the training. Empirical results show that conditional
DETR converges 6.7x faster for the backbones R50 and R101 and 10x faster for
stronger backbones DC5-R50 and DC5-R101. Code is available at

method modeled by a SMDP with continuous action space, Adaptive Forward

distributed proximal policy optimization (DPPO) algorithm for the specified
SMDP problem by modifying its GAE to better estimate the policy gradient in
SMDPs. We evaluate our approach both in the simulator and the real world.

Photons gain a gravity-induced mass when travelling through dark matter, and

improved speech recognition in both target languages, substantially better

performance in computer vision tasks, such as object detection and semantic
segmentation (SS). However, recent studies have shown evident weaknesses of
such models against adversarial perturbations. In a real-world scenario
instead, like autonomous driving, more attention should be devoted to
real-world adversarial examples (RWAEs), which are physical objects (e.g.,
billboards and printable patches) optimized to be adversarial to the entire
perception pipeline. This paper presents an in-depth evaluation of the
robustness of popular SS models by testing the effects of both digital and
real-world adversarial patches. These patches are crafted with powerful attacks
enriched with a novel loss function. Firstly, an investigation on the
Cityscapes dataset is conducted by extending the Expectation Over
Transformation (EOT) paradigm to cope with SS. Then, a novel attack
optimization, called scene-specific attack, is proposed. Such an attack
leverages the CARLA driving simulator to improve the transferability of the
proposed EOT-based attack to a real 3D environment. Finally, a printed physical
billboard containing an adversarial patch was tested in an outdoor driving
scenario to assess the feasibility of the studied attacks in the real world.
Exhaustive experiments revealed that the proposed attack formulations
outperform previous work to craft both digital and real-world adversarial
patches for SS. At the same time, the experimental results showed how these
attacks are notably less effective in the real world, hence questioning the

given rise to synthetic causal reasoning video datasets. These datasets
facilitate the development of AI algorithms that can reason about physical
interactions between objects. However, datasets thus far have primarily focused
on elementary physical events such as rolling or falling. There is currently a
scarcity of datasets that focus on the physical interactions that humans
perform daily with objects in the real world. To address this scarcity, we
introduce SPACE: A Simulator for Physical Interactions and Causal Learning in
3D Environments. The SPACE simulator allows us to generate the SPACE dataset, a
synthetic video dataset in a 3D environment, to systematically evaluate
physics-based models on a range of physical causal reasoning tasks. Inspired by
daily object interactions, the SPACE dataset comprises videos depicting three
types of physical events: containment, stability and contact. These events make
up the vast majority of the basic physical interactions between objects. We
then further evaluate it with a state-of-the-art physics-based deep model and
show that the SPACE dataset improves the learning of intuitive physics with an
approach inspired by curriculum learning. Repository:

and acceptability largely depend on their explicit and implicit interaction
capability with fellow human beings. As a result, social behavior is one of the
most sought-after qualities that a robot can possess. However, there is no
specific aspect and/or feature that defines socially acceptable behavior and it
largely depends on the situation, application, and society. In this article, we
investigate one such social behavior for collocated robots. Imagine a group of
people is interacting with each other and we want to join the group. We as
human beings do it in a socially acceptable manner, i.e., within the group, we
do position ourselves in such a way that we can participate in the group
activity without disturbing/obstructing anybody. To possess such a quality,
first, a robot needs to determine the formation of the group and then determine
a position for itself, which we humans do implicitly. The theory of f-formation
can be utilized for this purpose. As the types of formations can be very
diverse, detecting the social groups is not a trivial task. In this article, we
provide a comprehensive survey of the existing work on social interaction and
group detection using f-formation for robotics and other applications. We also
put forward a novel holistic survey framework combining all the possible
concerns and modules relevant to this problem. We define taxonomies based on
methods, camera views, datasets, detection capabilities and scale, evaluation
approaches, and application areas. We discuss certain open challenges and
limitations in current literature along with possible future research
directions based on this framework. In particular, we discuss the existing
methods/techniques and their relative merits and demerits, applications, and
provide a set of unsolved but relevant problems in this domain.

$\phi_2$ ($\alpha$) is not without its challenges, in part due to the need to
combine multiple physical observables from various related decay channels, and
therein lies a fundamental issue. Similarities in analysis procedures give rise
to systematic correlations between the measured inputs constraining $\phi_2$
that must be taken into account to avoid bias. Specifically, in the case of the
irreducible model uncertainty accompanying analyses involving the $\rho$ meson,
it is demonstrated that ignoring correlations derived from its pole parameters,
or indeed even treating correlations individually contained within each decay
channel, can ultimately lead to a bias in $\phi_2$ of $\mathcal{O}(1^\circ)$.
Correct treatment on the other hand, markedly reduces wandering of its central
value as a function of the model uncertainty strength with the added dividend
of a further improved overall uncertainty. Bias in the combination of $B^0 \to
(\rho \pi)^0$ and $B \to \rho \rho$ is also seen to depend on the statistical
strength of the former in relation to that of the model uncertainty in the
latter. This work can inspire other studies into the points at which systematic
correlations beyond those determined in single measurements matter in
combinations leading to other $CP$-violating weak phases such as $\phi_1$

due to lack of inversion center in its B20 cubic structure. The electronic

G2) and one at $R$ (R1) point. Based on this, we present a study where various
transport coefficients are investigated by using \textit{first-principle} based
DFT method for the temperature (T) range 40-300 K. For the chemical potential
($\mu$) corresponding to energies of these nodal points and at the Fermi level
(E$_F$), 3D constant energy surfaces are constructed. They have shown that the
number of states available at energies of these nodal points and the E$_F$
follows an increasing trend as R1 $>$ G2 $>$ E$_F$ $>$ G1 at T = 0 K. Similar
increasing behavior seems to follow by other transport coefficients at
different $\mu$ with T rise such as electrical
conductivity($\sigma$)/relaxation time($\tau$) ratio and electronic thermal
conductivity ($\kappa_e/\tau$ = $\kappa^0$). For example, at T = 100 K, $\sigma
/ \tau$ $\sim$ 0.13$\times$10$^{20}$ $\Omega^{-1} m^{-1} s^{-1}$ at G1 whereas
its value reaches $ \sim$ 0.18$\times$10$^{20}$ $\Omega^{-1} m^{-1} s^{-1}$ at

G2 $>$ E$_F$ $>$ R1 $>$ G1 at any given T. The values of $S$ are obtained to be
positive at the $\mu$ corresponding to the G2, R1 and E$_F$ (except G1) which
is increasing with the rise in T. Also, the dominant charge carriers at G1

slots. Parking slot detection performance has been dramatically improved by
deep learning techniques. Deep learning-based object detection methods can be
categorized into one-stage and two-stage approaches. Although it is well-known
that the two-stage approach outperforms the one-stage approach in general
object detection, they have performed similarly in parking slot detection so
far. We consider this is because the two-stage approach has not yet been
adequately specialized for parking slot detection. Thus, this paper proposes a
highly specialized two-stage parking slot detector that uses region-specific
multi-scale feature extraction. In the first stage, the proposed method finds
the entrance of the parking slot as a region proposal by estimating its center,
length, and orientation. The second stage of this method designates specific
regions that most contain the desired information and extracts features from
them. That is, features for the location and orientation are separately
extracted from only the specific regions that most contain the locational and
orientational information. In addition, multi-resolution feature maps are
utilized to increase both positioning and classification accuracies. A
high-resolution feature map is used to extract detailed information (location
and orientation), while another low-resolution feature map is used to extract
semantic information (type and occupancy). In experiments, the proposed method
was quantitatively evaluated with two large-scale public parking slot detection
datasets and outperformed previous methods, including both one-stage and
two-stage approaches.

been developed, which is based on the extended periodic motion concept. The
method is well suited to experimentally obtain amplitude-dependent modal
properties (modal frequency, damping ratio and deflection shape) for strongly
nonlinear systems. To isolate a nonlinear mode, the negative viscous damping
term of the extended periodic motion concept is approximated by ensuring phase
resonance between excitation and response. In this work, an alternative
approach to isolate a nonlinear mode is developed and analyzed: velocity
feedback. The accuracy of the extracted modal properties and robustness of
velocity feedback is first assessed by means of simulated experiments. The two
approaches phase resonance and velocity feedback are then compared in terms of
accuracy and experimental implementation effort. To this end, both approaches
are applied to an experimental specimen, which is a cantilevered beam
influenced by a strong dry friction nonlinearity. In this work, the discussion
is limited to single-point excitation. It is shown that a robust implementation
of velocity feedback requires the measurement of several response signals,
distributed over the structure. An advantage of velocity feedback is that no
controller is needed. The accuracy of the modal properties can, however, suffer
from imperfections of the excitation mechanism such as a phase lag due to
exciter-structure interactions or gyroscopic forces due to single-point
excitation.

that the observed area is increasing in time and the centroid positions of the

continue to be among the most popular and powerful machine learning models used
across multiple disciplines. The conventional wisdom of estimating the impact
of a feature in tree based models is to measure the \textit{node-wise reduction
of a loss function}, which (i) yields only global importance measures and (ii)
is known to suffer from severe biases. Conditional feature contributions (CFCs)
provide \textit{local}, case-by-case explanations of a prediction by following
the decision path and attributing changes in the expected output of the model
to each feature along the path. However, Lundberg et al. pointed out a
potential bias of CFCs which depends on the distance from the root of a tree.
The by now immensely popular alternative, SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP)
values appear to mitigate this bias but are computationally much more
expensive. Here we contribute a thorough comparison of the explanations

problems in order to provide data-driven algorithm recommendations to current

very similar rankings and interpretations. Analogous conclusions hold for the

medical image segmentation. In addition, most existing semi-supervised

and also lack explicit modeling of geometric structure and semantic
information, both of which limit the segmentation accuracy. In this work, we
present SimCVD, a simple contrastive distillation framework that significantly
advances state-of-the-art voxel-wise representation learning. We first describe
an unsupervised training strategy, which takes two views of an input volume and
predicts their signed distance maps of object boundaries in a contrastive
objective, with only two independent dropout as mask. This simple approach
works surprisingly well, performing on the same level as previous fully
supervised methods with much less labeled data. We hypothesize that dropout can
be viewed as a minimal form of data augmentation and makes the network robust
to representation collapse. Then, we propose to perform structural distillation
by distilling pair-wise similarities. We evaluate SimCVD on two popular
datasets: the Left Atrial Segmentation Challenge (LA) and the NIH pancreas CT
dataset. The results on the LA dataset demonstrate that, in two types of
labeled ratios (i.e., 20% and 10%), SimCVD achieves an average Dice score of
90.85% and 89.03% respectively, a 0.91% and 2.22% improvement compared to
previous best results. Our method can be trained in an end-to-end fashion,
showing the promise of utilizing SimCVD as a general framework for downstream

data is hard to collect and usually, only coarse-grained data is available.
Thus, obtaining fine-grained population distribution from coarse-grained
distribution becomes an important problem. To tackle this problem, existing
methods mainly rely on sufficient fine-grained ground truth for training, which
is not often available for the majority of cities. That limits the applications
of these methods and brings the necessity to transfer knowledge between

nanostructured Ag-Au, such as Ag-Au nanoparticles and nanopillars, have been

of the Ag-Au nanoalloys, the surface properties are required to be modeled with
first-principles precision. In this work, we propose a generalizable
machine-learning interatomic potential for the Ag-Au nanoalloys based on deep
neural networks, trained from a database constructed with the first-principle
calculations. This potential is highlighted by the accurate prediction of Au
(111) surface reconstruction and the segregation of Au towards the Ag-Au
nanoalloy surface, where the empirical force field failed in both cases.
Moreover, regarding the adsorption and diffusion of adatoms on surfaces, the
overall performance of our potential is better than the empirical force fields.
We stress that the reported surface properties are blind to the potential
modeling in the sense that none of the surface configurations is explicitly
included in the training database, therefore, the reported potential is
expected to have a strong ability of generalization to a wide range of

intelligent omni-surface (STAR-IOS) is one of the most promising categories.
Although pioneering works have demonstrated the benefits of STAR-IOSs in terms
of its wireless communication performance gain, several important issues remain
unclear including practical hardware implementations and physics-compliant
models for STAR-IOSs. In this paper, we answer these pressing questions of
STAR-IOSs by discussing four practical hardware implementations of STAR-IOSs,
as well as three hardware modelling methods and five channel modelling methods.
These discussions not only categorize existing smart surface technologies but
also serve as a physicscompliant pipeline for further investigating the
STAR-IOSs.

intriguing star-formation scenario. There are more than two dozen known star
clusters in its line of sight, but it is not clear which ones are physically
associated with CMa OB1. We use a clustering code that employs 5-dimensional
data from the Gaia DR2 catalogue to identify physical groups and obtain their
astrometric parameters and, in addition, we use two different isochrone-fitting
methods to estimate the ages of these groups. We find 15 stellar groups with
distances between 570 pc and 1650 pc, including 10 previously known and 5 new
open cluster candidates. Four groups, precisely the youngest ones ($<$ 20 Myr),
CMa05, CMa06, CMa07 and CMa08, are confirmed to be part of CMa OB1. We find
that CMa08, a new cluster candidate, may be the progenitor cluster of runaway
stars. CMa06 coincides with the well-studied CMa R1 star-forming region. While
CMa06 is still forming stars, due to the remaining material of the molecular
cloud associated with the Sh 2-262 nebula, CMa05, CMa07 and CMa08 seem to be in
more evolved stages of evolution, with no recent star-forming activity. The
properties of these CMa OB1 physical groups fit well in a monolithic scenario
of star formation, with a common formation mechanism, and having suffered
multiple episodes of star formation. This suggests that the hierarchical model
alone, which explains the populations of other parts of the same association,
is not sufficient to explain its whole formation history.

Packings of pentagons resist the intruder at significantly lower packing

on cybersecurity. However, the deployment of intrusion detection methods falls
short. One of the reasons for this is the lack of realistic evaluation
datasets, which makes it a challenge to develop techniques and compare them.
This is caused by the large amounts of effort it takes for a cyber analyst to
classify network connections. This has raised the need for methods (i) that can
learn from small sets of labeled data, (ii) that can make predictions on large
sets of unlabeled data, and (iii) that request the label of only specially
selected unlabeled data instances. Hence, Active Learning (AL) methods are of
interest. These approaches choose specific unlabeled instances by a query
function that are expected to improve overall classification performance. The
resulting query observations are labeled by a human expert and added to the
labeled set.
  In this paper, we propose a new hybrid AL method called Jasmine. Firstly, it
determines how suitable each observation is for querying, i.e., how likely it
is to enhance classification. These properties are the uncertainty score and
anomaly score. Secondly, Jasmine introduces dynamic updating. This allows the
model to adjust the balance between querying uncertain, anomalous and randomly
selected observations. To this end, Jasmine is able to learn the best query
strategy during the labeling process. This is in contrast to the other AL
methods in cybersecurity that all have static, predetermined query functions.
We show that dynamic updating, and therefore Jasmine, is able to consistently
obtain good and more robust results than querying only uncertainties, only
anomalies or a fixed combination of the two.

iv) propenal and allyl alcohol; v) propynal and propargyl alcohol; vi)
glycolaldehyde and ethylene glycol; vii) along with one pair of ketone-alcohol

automatically segmented cell of a candidate cytology image as a point in a 2D

evaluated automatically but highly transparent for human verification. On our

temperature. We introduce a simple modification to the interaction picture
DMQMC method (IP-DMQMC) which overcomes the limitation of only sampling one
inverse temperature point at a time, instead allowing for the sampling of a
temperature range within a single calculation thereby reducing the
computational cost. At the target inverse temperature, instead of ending the
simulation, we incorporate a change of picture away from the interaction
picture. The resulting equations of motion have piecewise functions and use the
interaction picture in the first phase of a simulation, followed by the
application of the Bloch equation once the target inverse temperature is
reached. We find that the performance of this method is similar to or better
than the DMQMC and IP-DMQMC algorithms in a variety of molecular test systems.

underlying quantum state and measurements. This phenomenon is known as
(quantum) self-testing.
  Self-testing constitutes a significant research area with practical and
theoretical ramifications for quantum information theory. But since its
conception two decades ago by Mayers and Yao, the common way to rigorously
formulate self-testing has been in terms of operator-algebraic identities, and
this formulation lacks an operational interpretation. In particular, it is
unclear how to formulate self-testing in other physical theories, in
formulations of quantum theory not referring to operator-algebra, or in
scenarios causally different from the standard one.
  In this paper, we explain how to understand quantum self-testing
operationally, in terms of causally structured dilations of the input-output
channel encoding the correlations. These dilations model side-information which
leaks to an environment according to a specific schedule, and we show how
self-testing concerns the relative strength between such scheduled leaks of
information. As such, the title of our paper has double meaning: we recast
conventional quantum self-testing in terms of information-leaks to an
environment -- and this realises quantum self-testing as a special case within
the surroundings of a general operational framework.
  Our new approach to quantum self-testing not only supplies an operational
understanding apt for various generalisations, but also resolves some
unexplained aspects of the existing definition, naturally suggests a distance
measure suitable for robust self-testing, and points towards self-testing as a
modular concept in a larger, cryptographic perspective.

framework of the cosmographic approach, with emphasis on the Running Vacuum
models (RVMs). We assess their viability using different information criteria
and compare them with the so-called Ghost DE models (GDEs) as well as with the
concordance $\Lambda$CDM model. We use the Hubble diagrams for Pantheon SnIa,
quasars (QSOs), gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) as well as the data on baryonic
acoustic oscillations (BAOs) in four different combinations. Upon minimizing
the $\chi^2$ function of the distance modulus in the context of the Markov
Chain Monte Carlo method (MCMC), we put constraints on the current values of
the standard cosmographic parameters in a model-independent way. It turns out
that, in the absence of BAOs data, the various DE models generally exhibit
cosmographic tensions with the observations at the highest redshifts (namely
with the QSOs and GRBs data). However, if we include the robust observations
from BAOs to our cosmographic sample, the $\Lambda$CDM and RVMs are clearly
favored against the GDEs. Finally, judging from the perspective of the deviance
information criterion (DIC), which enables us to compare models making use of
the Markov chains of the MCMC method, we conclude that the RVMs are the
preferred kind of DE models. We find it remarkable that these models, which had
been previously shown to be capable of alleviating the $\sigma_8$ and $H_0$
tensions, appear now also as the most successful ones at the level of the
cosmographic analysis.

Understanding and manipulating these properties demands resolving the

$4d$ spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here, we use O-K and Ru $M_3$ x-ray absorption
(XAS) and Ru $M_3$ resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) to disentangle
the contributions of crystal field, SOC, and electronic correlations in
RuO$_2$. The locally orthorhombic site symmetry of the Ru ions introduces
significant crystal field contributions beyond the approximate octahedral
coordination yielding a crystal field energy scale of $\Delta(t_{2g})\approx 1$
eV breaking the degeneracy of the $t_{2g}$ orbitals. This splitting exceeds the
Ru SOC ($\approx160$ meV) suggesting a more subtle role of SOC, primarily
through the modification of itinerant (rather than local) $4d$ electronic
states, ultimately highlighting the importance of the local symmetry in
RuO$_2$. Remarkably, our analysis can be extended to other members of the
rutile family, thus advancing the comprehension of the interplay among crystal
field symmetry, electron correlations, and SOC in transition metal compounds
with the rutile structure.

superconductivity at Tc = 0.26 K. The 2nd-order phase transition at To presents
signatures in specific heat and thermal expansion, but none in magnetization
and ac-susceptibility, indicating a non-magnetic origin of phase I. In
addition, an upturn of the in-plane resistivity at To points to a gap opening
at the Fermi level in the basal plane. Thermal expansion indicates a strong
positive pressure dependence of To , dTo/dp = 1.5 K/GPa, in contrast to the
strong negative pressure coefficient observed for magnetic order in Ce-based
Kondo lattices close to a QCP. Similarly, an in-plane magnetic field shifts To
to higher temperatures and transforms phase I into another non-magnetic phase

substantial mixing of the excited crystalline-electric-field (CEF) states into

heavy bands at the Fermi level which are prone to nesting. The huge sensitivity

reservoirs. Forecasts help operators schedule power generation in advance to

range to ~2 weeks ahead, marking the predictability barrier of deterministic
weather forecasts. Reliable inflow forecasts in the sub-seasonal to seasonal
(S2S) range would allow operators to take proactive action to mitigate risks of
adverse weather conditions, thereby improving water management and increasing
revenue. This study outlines a method of deriving skilful S2S inflow forecasts
using a case study reservoir in the Scottish Highlands. We generate ensemble
inflow forecasts by training a linear regression model for the observed inflow
onto S2S ensemble precipitation predictions from the European Centre for
Medium-range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF). Subsequently, post-processing
techniques from Ensemble Model Output Statistics are applied to derive
calibrated S2S probabilistic inflow forecasts, without the application of a
separate hydrological model. We find the S2S probabilistic inflow forecasts
hold skill relative to climatological forecasts up to 6 weeks ahead. The inflow
forecasts hold greater skill during winter compared with summer. The forecasts,
however, struggle to predict high summer inflows, even at short lead-times. The
potential for the S2S probabilistic inflow forecasts to improve water
management and deliver increased economic value is confirmed using a stylised
cost model. While applied to hydropower forecasting, the results and methods
presented here are relevant to broader fields of water management and S2S
forecasting applications.

properties of a system or time series under the operation of time reversal, has
received an increasing attention during the last decades, thanks to the
information it provides about the mechanisms underlying the observed dynamics.
Following the need of analysing real-world time series, many irreversibility
metrics and tests have been proposed, each one associated with different
requirements in terms of e.g. minimum time series length or computational cost.
We here build upon previously proposed tests based on the concept of
permutation patterns, but deviating from them through the inclusion of
information about the amplitude of the signal and how this evolves over time.
We show, by means of synthetic time series, that the results yielded by this
method are complementary to the ones obtained by using permutation patterns
alone, thus suggesting that ""one irreversibility metric does not fit all"" We
further apply the proposed metric to the analysis of two real-world data sets.

years due to their desirable aerodynamic force characteristics. In this study,
we are numerically investigating the unsteady flow past a NACA 0012 airfoil
under sinusoidally pitching motion, using a finite volume based sharp interface
immersed boundary solver. The flow is investigated in the low Reynolds number
regime (Re=3000) for reduced frequencies of 0.1 and 0.5, at three different
pivot locations (c/3, c/2 and 2c/3 from the leading edge). The airfoil is
subjected to sinusoidal oscillations with its incidence angle varying from 15o
to 45o. Leading edge vortices (LEVs) that are formed during the pitching motion
dictate the transient aerodynamic characteristics. The flow field data is used
to identify individual LEVs in the flow field. The spatio-temporal evolution of
LEVs in terms of their strengths are traced throughout the pitching cycle to
obtain a quantitative estimate of its evolution. The effect of pivot location
and pitching frequency on the vortex evolution and aerodynamic forces is
investigated. Change in pitching frequency is found to have a drastic effect on
the vortex dynamics. LEV formation is delayed to higher fractional times and
LEVs are found to interact and merge into each other at higher frequencies. The
maximum lift and drag are also found to increase with pitching frequency. Pivot
location is found to have a higher influence on the magnitude and phase of
aerodynamic coefficients at higher frequencies. However, at both frequencies,
moving the pivot axis aftward is found to delay LEV evolution and cause a phase
lag on the aerodynamic forces.

cooperative target pair do not have perfect knowledge of the attacker states,
and hence they estimate the attacker states using an extended Kalman filter

targets while respecting imposed state and control constraints. Theoretical

survival, given the initial positions of the attacker and target agents.

effectiveness, not just when applied for re-ranking the output of classical

literature in neural ranking, two dense retrieval families have become
apparent: single representation, where entire passages are represented by a
single embedding (usually BERT's [CLS] token, as exemplified by the recent ANCE
approach), or multiple representations, where each token in a passage is
represented by its own embedding (as exemplified by the recent ColBERT
approach). These two families have not been directly compared. However, because
of the likely importance of dense retrieval moving forward, a clear
understanding of their advantages and disadvantages is paramount. To this end,
this paper contributes a direct study on their comparative effectiveness,
noting situations where each method under/over performs w.r.t. each other, and
w.r.t. a BM25 baseline. We observe that, while ANCE is more efficient than
ColBERT in terms of response time and memory usage, multiple representations
are statistically more effective than the single representations for MAP and
MRR@10. We also show that multiple representations obtain better improvements

by injecting a single edge. We show that adopting the aggregation scheme with a
high breakdown point (e.g., median or trimmed mean) could significantly enhance
the robustness of GCNs against structural attacks. Extensive experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate that such a simple but effective method
achieves the best robustness performance compared to state-of-the-art models.

For a prime $p$, if $a_p=2r$, then $p$ is necessarily of the form $x^2+r^2$.
Fixing $r$ and $D$, and assuming that the Hardy-Littlewood Conjecture holds, we
obtain the density of the primes with $a_p=2r$ inside the set of primes of the
form $x^2+r^2$. In some cases, the density is $1/4$, which is a natural
expectation, but it fails to be true for all $D$. In particular, we give a full
list of $D$ and $r$ when there is no prime $p$ for $a_p=2r$.

combination is particularly interesting as it significantly boosts the
potential of either detector, beyond simply adding their neutrino mass ordering
sensitivities, by removing a degeneracy in the determination of $\Delta
m_{31}^2$ between the two experiments when assuming the wrong ordering. The
study is based on the latest projected performances for JUNO, and on simulation
tools using a full Monte Carlo approach to the KM3NeT/ORCA response with a
careful assessment of its energy systematics. From this analysis, a $5\sigma$
determination of the neutrino mass ordering is expected after 6 years of joint
data taking for any value of the oscillation parameters. This sensitivity would
be achieved after only 2 years of joint data taking assuming the current global
best-fit values for those parameters for normal ordering.

In
environmental modelling, trajectories are crucial to study fluid pollution,
animal migrations, oil slick patterns or land movements. In this contribution,
we address the lack of standardization and integration existing in current
approaches to handle trajectory data. Within this scenario, challenges extend
from the extraction of a trajectory from raw sensor data to the application of
mathematical tools for modeling or making inferences about populations and
their environments. This work introduces a generic framework that addresses the
problem as a whole, i.e., a software library to handle trajectory data. It
contains a robust tracking module aiming at making data acquisition handy,
artificial generation of trajectories powered by different stochastic models to
aid comparisons among experimental and theoretical data, a statistical kit for
analyzing patterns in groups of trajectories and other resources to speed up
pre-processing of trajectory data. It is worth emphasizing that this library
does not make assumptions about the nature of trajectories (e.g., those from
GPS), which facilitates its usage across different disciplines. We validate the
software by reproducing key results when modelling dynamical systems related to
environmental modelling applications. An example script to facilitate
reproduction is presented for each case.

that allows heat to transfer easier in one direction (forward bias) than in the
opposite direction (reverse bias). Unlike conductive and convective thermal
diodes, a photonic thermal diode operates in a contactless mode and may afford
a large operating temperature range. In this work, a novel near-field photonic
thermal diode with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) and indium antimonide (InSb)
is proposed and theoretically demonstrated. The temperature dependence of the
interband absorption of InSb is used to couple (or decouple) with the
hyperbolic phonon polaritons in hBN. The numerical analysis predicts a
rectification ratio greater than 17 for a 10 nm vacuum gap when operating at an
average temperature of 300 K and a temperature difference of 200 K. The
calculated rectification ratio exceeds 35 with higher average temperatures and
larger temperature differences. The mechanism proposed here for achieving
photonic thermal rectification provides a new way of controlling radiative heat
transfer.

regardless of any momentum of initial state. The quantized displacement is
related to a reduced Chern number defined as a line integral of Berry curvature

fields often employs multiple-monitors stations, however, some education
laboratories employ single-monitor stations. This is unrepresentative of what
students will encounter in practice and experiential learning. RESEARCH
QUESTIONS: This study aims to answer three research questions. The questions
include discovering the experiential observations of the students, contrasting
the performance of the students using one monitor versus those using two
monitors, and an investigation of the ways in which multiple monitors were
employed by the students. METHODOLOGY: Half of the students in the study had
access to multiple monitors. This was the only difference between the two study
groups. This study contrasts grade medians and conducts median-test evaluation.
Additionally, an experience survey facilitated likert-scale values and
open-ended feedback questions facilitated textual analysis. Limitations of the
study include the small sample size (86 students) and lack of control of
participant composition. FINDINGS: Students reacted very favorably in rating
their experience using the intervention. Overall, the multiple-monitor group

transient wall heat losses. Measurements of the spatially and temporally
evolving thermal boundary layer (TBL) are required to facilitate this
knowledge. This work takes advantage of hybrid fs/ps rotational coherent
anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (HRCARS) to measure single-shot, wall-normal gas
temperatures, which provide exclusive access to the TBL. Phosphor thermometry
is used to measure wall temperature. Experiments are performed in a
fixed-volume chamber that operates with a transient pressure rise/decay to
simulate engine-relevant compression/expansion events. This simplified
environment is conducive for fundamental BL studies associated with
engine-relevant processes. The TBL development and corresponding heat losses
are evaluated within two engine-relevant regimes: (1) an unburned-gas regime
comprised of gaseous compression and (2) a burned-gas regime, which includes
high-temperature compression/expansion processes. The time-history of important
BL quantities such as gas / wall temperatures, TBL thickness, wall heat flux,
and relative energy lost at the wall are evaluated in these regimes. During the
mild compression, Tcore increases by 30K and a TBL is initiated with {\delta}T
~ 200 {\mu}m. Wall heat fluxes remain below 6 kW/m2, but corresponds to ~6%
energy loss per ms. In the burned-gas regime, Tcore resembles adiabatic flame
temperatures, while Twall increases by 16K. A TBL rapidly develops as {\delta}T
increases from 290-730 {\mu}m. Energy losses in excess of 25% occur after flame
impingement and slowly decay to ~10% at the end of expansion. Measurements also
resolve thermal mixing of fresh- and burned gases during expansion, which yield
strong temperature reversals in the TBL. Findings are compared to canonical
environments and demonstrate the transient TBL nature during engine-relevant
processes.

  Angular Momentum(OAM) Modes of an Optical Fiber","6 pages",,,,"physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We investigate the role of polarization effects in orbital angular momentum
modes of an optical fiber. Specifically, we revisit the removal of the
degeneracy of the $HE$ and the $EH$ vector modes that exists within the weakly
guiding approximation (WGA); within WGA, these two vector modes coalesce into a
single spatial (scalar) orbital angular momentum (OAM) mode, defined by a
common topological charge and associated with left or right circular
polarization. While the polarization term of the vector wave equation acting as
a Hermitian perturbation operator accounts for the splitting of the $HE$ and
the $EH$ vector modes, its extension to explain the accompanying field
correction, called the polarization-induced field, encounters hurdles; this
field is characterized by a topological charge differing by two in magnitude.
The problems are critically examined with a possible remedy and its
implications.

specifically, plays a central role in human language processing. Consequently,
in designing computational models of language, the de facto approach is to
present sentences to machines with the words ordered in the same order as in
the original human-authored sentence. The very essence of this work is to
question the implicit assumption that this is desirable and inject theoretical
soundness into the consideration of word order in natural language processing.
In this thesis, we begin by uniting the disparate treatments of word order in
cognitive science, psycholinguistics, computational linguistics, and natural
language processing under a flexible algorithmic framework. We proceed to use
this heterogeneous theoretical foundation as the basis for exploring new word
orders with an undercurrent of psycholinguistic optimality. In particular, we
focus on notions of dependency length minimization given the difficulties in
human and computational language processing in handling long-distance
dependencies. We then discuss algorithms for finding optimal word orders
efficiently in spite of the combinatorial space of possibilities. We conclude
by addressing the implications of these word orders on human language and their
downstream impacts when integrated in computational models.

  Analysis",,,,,"cs.IR cs.CL cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Documents often contain complex physical structures, which make the Document
Layout Analysis (DLA) task challenging. As a pre-processing step for content
extraction, DLA has the potential to capture rich information in historical or
scientific documents on a large scale. Although many deep-learning-based
methods from computer vision have already achieved excellent performance in
detecting \emph{Figure} from documents, they are still unsatisfactory in
recognizing the \emph{List}, \emph{Table}, \emph{Text} and \emph{Title}
category blocks in DLA. This paper proposes a VTLayout model fusing the
documents' deep visual, shallow visual, and text features to localize and
identify different category blocks. The model mainly includes two stages, and
the three feature extractors are built in the second stage. In the first stage,
the Cascade Mask R-CNN model is applied directly to localize all category
blocks of the documents. In the second stage, the deep visual, shallow visual,
and text features are extracted for fusion to identify the category blocks of
documents. As a result, we strengthen the classification power of different
category blocks based on the existing localization technique. The experimental
results show that the identification capability of the VTLayout is superior to
the most advanced method of DLA based on the PubLayNet dataset, and the F1
score is as high as 0.9599.

seemingly conflicting goals, to serve high quality content tailored to
individual user's taste and to adapt quickly to the ever changing environment.
The former requires a complex machine learning model that is trained on a large
amount of data; the latter requires frequent update to the model. We present an
incremental learning solution to provide both the training efficiency and the
model quality. Our solution is based on sequential Bayesian update and
quadratic approximation. Our focus is on large-scale personalized logistic
regression models, with extensions to deep learning models. This paper fills in
the gap between the theory and the practice by addressing a few implementation
challenges that arise when applying incremental learning to large personalized
recommender systems. Detailed offline and online experiments demonstrated our
approach can significantly shorten the training time while maintaining the
model accuracy. The solution is deployed in LinkedIn and directly applicable to
industrial scale recommender systems.

  Approach",,,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Water governing systems are twisted with complex interplays among levels and
scales which embody their structures. Typically, the mismatch between
human-generated and natural systems produces externalities and inefficiencies
reflectable in spatial scales. The largely known problem of fit in water
governance is investigated to detect the issues of fit between
administrative/institutional scales and the hydrological one in a lake basin.
To implement the idea, constraining the level of analysis interlinked to the
concentrated levels of administration in spatial scales, the fit of the
governing system was analyzed by means of statistical mechanics. Modeling the
structure of water demand/supply governing system in a given region through the
Curie-Weiss Mean Field approximation, the system cost in relation to its
structure and fit was appraised and compared with two other conceptual
structures in the Urmia Lake Basin in Iran. The methodology articulated an
analysis framework for exploring the effectiveness of the formulated water
demand/supply governing system and its fit to the relevant hydrological system.
The findings of this study may help developing strategies to encourage
adaptations, rescaling/reforms for effective watershed management.
