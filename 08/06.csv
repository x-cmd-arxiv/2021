capturing properties of rogue waves that emerge in the nonlinear propagation of
unidirectional wave trains. As an exact breather solution of the
one-dimensional focusing nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation with nonzero boundary
conditions, the PS can be viewed as a soliton on finite background, i.e. a
nonlinear superposition of a soliton and a monochromatic wave. A recent
mathematical work showed that both nonzero boundary conditions and solitonic
content are not pre-requisites for the PS occurrence. Instead, it has been
demonstrated that PS can emerge locally, as an asymptotic structure arising
from the propagation of an arbitrary large decaying pulse, independently of its
solitonic content. This mathematical discovery has changed the widely accepted
paradigm of the solitonic nature of rogue waves by enabling the PS to emerge
from a partially radiative or even completely solitonless initial data. In this
work, we realize the mathematically predicted universal mechanism of the local
PS emergence in a water tank experiment with a particular aim to control the
point of the PS occurrence in space-time by imposing an appropriately chosen
initial chirp. By employing the inverse scattering transform for the synthesis
of the initial data, we are able to engineer a localized wave packet with a
prescribed solitonic and radiative content. This enabled us to control the
position of the emergence of the rogue wave by adjusting the inverse scattering
spectrum. The proposed method of the nonlinear spectral engineering is found to
be robust to higher-order nonlinear effects inevitable in realistic wave
propagation conditions.

method in the plane wave basis and decompose the corresponding matrix elements
of operators into irreducible representations of the relevant point groups. The
proposed approach allows one to benefit from the knowledge of the long-range
interaction and avoids complications from partial wave mixing in a finite
volume. We consider spin-singlet channels in the two-nucleon system and
pion-pion scattering in the $\rho$-meson channel in the rest and moving frames
to illustrate the method for non-relativistic and relativistic systems,
respectively. For the two-nucleon system, the long-range interaction due to the
one-pion exchange is found to make the single-channel L\""uscher formula
unreliable at the physical pion mass. For S-wave dominated states, the
single-channel L\""uscher method suffers from significant finite-volume
artifacts for a $L=3$~fm box, but it works well for boxes with $L>5$~fm.
However, for P-wave dominated states, significant partial wave mixing effects
prevent the application of the single-channel L\""uscher formula regardless of
the box size (except for the near-threshold region). Using a toy model to
generate synthetic data for finite-volume energies, we show that our
effective-field-theory-based approach in the plane wave basis is capable of a
reliable extraction of the phase shifts. For pion-pion scattering, we employ a
phenomenological model to fit lattice QCD results at the physical pion mass.
The extracted P-wave phase shifts are found to be in a good agreement with the

wireless resources for addressing learner and data heterogeneity. Thus, we
propose a reactive method for the allocation of wireless resources, that
happens dynamically each FL round, and is based on each learner's contribution
to the general model. In addition to this, we explore the use of static methods
that remain constant across all rounds. Since we expect partial work from each

changing environment. The results show that proactive measures are effective
and versatile at improving system accuracy, and quickly learning the CO class

tradeoff between FedProx intensity and resource allocation efforts.
Nonetheless, a well adjusted FedProx local optimizer allows for an even better

of the systems it should make connections with. The adversary meanwhile might
move between any systems whatever, possibly seeking out systems with unusual
roles that facilitate certain accesses. We use unsupervised learning to cluster

as potentially malicious. The second method is based on the premise that the
temporal patterns of inter-system processes that facilitate these connections
depend on the roles of the systems involved. If a process is compromised by an
attacker, these normal patterns might be disrupted in discernible ways. We
apply frequent-itemset mining to process sequences to establish regular

cellular systems can carry a larger volume of traffic, dense deployment, in
turn, increases the BS installation and maintenance cost, which has been
largely ignored in their utilization. In this paper, we present an approach to
the problem of mmWave BS deployment in urban environments by minimizing BS
deployment cost subject to BS association and user equipment (UE) outage
constraints. By exploiting the macro diversity, which enables each UE to be
associated with multiple BSs, we derive an expression for UE outage that
integrates physical blockage, UE access-limited blockage, and
signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) outage into its expression. The
minimum-cost BS deployment problem is then formulated as integer non-linear

pursuit of the optimal solution by decomposing the original problem into the
two separable subproblems, i.e., cell coverage optimization and minimum subset
selection subproblems. We provide the optimal solution and theoretical
justifications for each subproblem. The simulation results demonstrating UE
outage guarantees of the proposed method are presented. Interestingly, the

$\epsilon$-optimal policy and achieve the worst-case optimal rate, it is
unknown whether low-regret algorithms can obtain the instance-optimal rate for
policy identification. We show this is not possible -- there exists a
fundamental tradeoff between achieving low regret and identifying an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy at the instance-optimal rate.
  Motivated by our negative finding, we propose a new measure of
instance-dependent sample complexity for PAC tabular reinforcement learning
which explicitly accounts for the attainable state visitation distributions in
the underlying MDP. We then propose and analyze a novel, planning-based
algorithm which attains this sample complexity -- yielding a complexity which
scales with the suboptimality gaps and the ""reachability"" of a state. We show
our algorithm is nearly minimax optimal, and on several examples that our
instance-dependent sample complexity offers significant improvements over
worst-case bounds.

infrastructure-free, multi-stage SLAM system that utilizes an Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) to accurately localize IoT devices in a 3D indoor space where GPS
signals are unavailable or weak, e.g., manufacturing factories, disaster sites,
or smart buildings. The lack of GPS signals and infrastructure support makes
most of the existing indoor localization systems not practical when localizing
a large number of wireless IoT devices. In addition, safety concerns, access
restriction, and simply the huge amount of IoT devices make it not practical
for humans to manually localize and track IoT devices. To address these
challenges, the UAV in our LIDAUS system conducts multi-stage 3D SLAM trips to
localize devices based only on RSSIs, the most widely available measurement of
the signals of almost all commodity IoT devices. The main novelties of the
system include a weighted entropy-based clustering algorithm to select high
quality RSSI observation locations, a 3D U-SLAM algorithm that is enhanced by
deploying anchor beacons along the UAV's path, and the path planning based on
Eulerian cycles on multi-layer grid graphs that model the space in exploring
stage and Steiner tree paths in searching stages. Our simulations and
experiments of Bluetooth IoT devices have demonstrated that the system can
achieve high localization accuracy based only on RSSIs of commodity IoT

time-dependent scalar fields in hydrodynamics. While persistence diagrams can
provide a powerful topological summary of data, the standard space of
persistence diagrams lacks the sufficient algebraic and analytic structure
required for many theoretical and computational analyses. We enrich the space
of persistence diagrams by isometrically embedding it into a Lipschitz-free
space, a Banach space built from a universal construction. We utilize the
Banach space structure to define bounded variation paths of persistence
diagrams, which can be studied using the path signature, a
reparametrization-invariant characterization of paths valued in a Banach space.
The signature is universal and characteristic, which allows us to theoretically
characterize measures on the space of paths and motivates its use in the
context of kernel methods. However, kernel methods often require a feature map
into a Hilbert space, so we introduce the moment map, a stable and injective
feature map for static persistence diagrams, and compose it with the discrete
path signature, producing a computable feature map into a Hilbert space.
Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our methods by applying this to a

designing efficient learning algorithms for a large system in which each agent
has only limited or partial information of the entire system. While exciting
progress has been made to analyze decentralized MARL with the network of agents
for social networks and team video games, little is known theoretically for
decentralized MARL with the network of states for modeling self-driving
vehicles, ride-sharing, and data and traffic routing.
  This paper proposes a framework of localized training and decentralized
execution to study MARL with network of states. Localized training means that
agents only need to collect local information in their neighboring states
during the training phase; decentralized execution implies that agents can
execute afterwards the learned decentralized policies, which depend only on
agents' current states.
  The theoretical analysis consists of three key components: the first is the
reformulation of the MARL system as a networked Markov decision process with
teams of agents, enabling updating the associated team Q-function in a
localized fashion; the second is the Bellman equation for the value function
and the appropriate Q-function on the probability measure space; and the third
is the exponential decay property of the team Q-function, facilitating its
approximation with efficient sample efficiency and controllable error.
  The theoretical analysis paves the way for a new algorithm LTDE-Neural-AC,
where the actor-critic approach with over-parameterized neural networks is
proposed. The convergence and sample complexity is established and shown to be
scalable with respect to the sizes of both agents and states. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first neural network based MARL algorithm with

challenge is the separation of the different astrophysical sources, and to
distinguish between them and the instrumental noise. One of the goals of LISA
is to probe the early Universe by detecting stochastic GW backgrounds. As
correlation with other detectors is not possible for LISA, discrimination of
such a GW background from the instrumental noise requires a good estimate of
the latter. To this purpose we have revisited Time Delay Interferometry (TDI)
to look for new TDI signal combinations that fulfill the laser frequency noise
suppression requirements. We illustrate that it is possible to do a linear
combination of these TDI channels to find special null-combinations that
suppress gravitational waves and mainly carry information about instrumental
noise. We find that there exist many null-combinations that show different
sensitivities to gravitational waves, some of which seem more suitable than the
traditional T combination for estimating test-mass acceleration noise. In an
idealised LISA configuration, they are all sensitive to a particular linear
combination of the six test-masses acceleration, similar to a rigid rotation of
the LISA triangle. In the following article, we illustrate what are the noise
properties that can be extracted by monitoring these interferometry signals and
discuss the implication of these findings for the detection of stochastic GW
backgrounds.

insufficient computing efficiency due to the so-called von Neumann bottleneck
cannot satisfy the demand for real-time processing of rapidly growing data.
Memristive in-memory computing is a promising candidate for highly efficient
data processing. However, performance of memristors varies significantly
because of microstructure change induced by electric-driven matter migration.
Here, we propose an all-optically controlled (AOC) memristor with a simple
Au/ZnO/Pt sandwich structure based on a purely electronic tuning mechanism of
memconductance. The memconductance can be reversibly tuned only by light
irradiation with different wavelengths. The device can be used to perform
in-memory computation such as nonvolatile neuromorphic computing and Boolean
logic functions. Moreover, no microstructure change is involved during the
operation of our AOC memristor which demonstrates superior operation stability.
Based on this and its structural simplicity, the device has attractive
application prospects for the next generation of computing systems.

that mediates platelet adhesion to subendothelial collagen and platelet
aggregation at high shear rates. Its hemostatic function and thrombogenic
effect, as well as susceptibility to enzymatic cleavage, are regulated by a
conformational change from a collapsed globular state to a stretched state.
Therefore, it is essential to account for the conformation of the vWF multimers
when modeling vWF-mediated thrombosis or vWF degradation. We introduce a
continuum model of vWF unfolding that is developed within the framework of our
multi-constituent model of platelet-mediated thrombosis. The model considers
two interconvertible vWF species corresponding to the collapsed and stretched
conformational states. vWF unfolding takes place via two regimes: tumbling in
simple shear and strong unfolding in flows with dominant extensional component.
These two regimes were demonstrated in a Couette flow between parallel plates
and an extensional flow in a cross-slot geometry. The vWF unfolding model was
then verified in several microfluidic systems designed for inducing high-shear
vWF-mediated thrombosis and screening for von Willebrand Disease. The model
predicted high concentration of stretched vWF in key regions where occlusive
thrombosis was observed experimentally. Strong unfolding caused by the
extensional flow was limited to the center axis or middle plane of the
channels, whereas vWF unfolding near the channel walls relied upon the shear
tumbling mechanism. The continuum model of vWF unfolding presented in this work
can be employed in numerical simulations of vWF-mediated thrombosis or vWF
degradation in complex geometries. However, extending the model to 3-D
arbitrary flows and turbulent flows will pose considerable challenges.

data improvements have made tensions emerge between low- and high-redshift
observables, most importantly in determinations of the Hubble constant $H_0$
and the (rescaled) clustering amplitude $S_8$. The high-redshift data, from the
cosmic microwave background (CMB), crucially relies on recombination physics
for its interpretation. Here we study how small-scale baryon inhomogeneities
(i.e., clumping) can affect recombination and consider whether they can relieve
both the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. Such small-scale clumping, which may be
caused by primordial magnetic fields or baryon isocurvature below kpc scales,
enhances the recombination rate even when averaged over larger scales, shifting
recombination to earlier times. We introduce a flexible clumping model,
parametrized via three spatial zones with free densities and volume fractions,
and use it to study the impact of clumping on CMB observables. We find that
increasing $H_0$ decreases both $\Omega_m$ and $S_8$, which alleviates the
$S_8$ tension. On the other hand, the shift in $\Omega_m$ is disfavored by the
low-$z$ baryon-acoustic-oscillations measurements. We find that the clumping
parameters that can change the CMB sound horizon enough to explain the $H_0$
tension also alter the damping tail, so they are disfavored by current Planck
2018 data. We test how the CMB damping-tail information rules out changes to
recombination by first removing $\ell>1000$ multipoles in Planck data, where we
find that clumping could resolve the $H_0$ tension. Furthermore, we make
predictions for future CMB experiments, as their improved damping-tail
precision can better constrain departures from standard recombination. Both the
Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 will provide decisive evidence for or against
clumping as a resolution to the $H_0$ tension.

widely adopted in economic policy design, mechanism design, or economics at
large. At the same time, current economic methodology is limited by a lack of
counterfactual data, simplistic behavioral models, and limited opportunities to
experiment with policies and evaluate behavioral responses. Here we show that
machine-learning-based economic simulation is a powerful policy and mechanism
design framework to overcome these limitations. The AI Economist is a
two-level, deep RL framework that trains both agents and a social planner who
co-adapt, providing a tractable solution to the highly unstable and novel
two-level RL challenge. From a simple specification of an economy, we learn
rational agent behaviors that adapt to learned planner policies and vice versa.
We demonstrate the efficacy of the AI Economist on the problem of optimal
taxation. In simple one-step economies, the AI Economist recovers the optimal
tax policy of economic theory. In complex, dynamic economies, the AI Economist
substantially improves both utilitarian social welfare and the trade-off
between equality and productivity over baselines. It does so despite emergent
tax-gaming strategies, while accounting for agent interactions and behavioral
change more accurately than economic theory. These results demonstrate for the
first time that two-level, deep RL can be used for understanding and as a
complement to theory for economic design, unlocking a new computational
learning-based approach to understanding economic policy.

classifiers to maximize their misclassification rates is a central focus of
adversarial machine learning. An alternative approach is to synthesize
adversarial examples from scratch using GAN-like structures, albeit with the
use of large amounts of training data. By contrast, this paper considers
one-shot synthesis of adversarial examples; the inputs are synthesized from
scratch to induce arbitrary soft predictions at the output of pre-trained
models, while simultaneously maintaining high similarity to specified inputs.
To this end, we present a problem that encodes objectives on the distance
between the desired and output distributions of the trained model and the
similarity between such inputs and the synthesized examples. We prove that the
formulated problem is NP-complete. Then, we advance a generative approach to
the solution in which the adversarial examples are obtained as the output of a
generative network whose parameters are iteratively updated by optimizing
surrogate loss functions for the dual-objective. We demonstrate the generality
and versatility of the framework and approach proposed through applications to
the design of targeted adversarial attacks, generation of decision boundary
samples, and synthesis of low confidence classification inputs. The approach is
further extended to an ensemble of models with different soft output
specifications. The experimental results verify that the targeted and
confidence reduction attack methods developed perform on par with
state-of-the-art algorithms.

and unifies various established concepts across different fields, most notably
the classical notion of splines and the topological notion of GKM theory. The
former consists of piecewise polynomials on a combinatorial geometric object
like a polytope, whose polynomial pieces agree to a specified degree of
differentiability. The latter is a graph-theoretic construction of
torus-equivariant cohomology that Shareshian and Wachs used to reformulate the
well-known Stanley$\unicode{x2013}$Stembridge conjecture, a reformulation that
was recently proven to hold by Brosnan and Chow and independently Guay-Paquet.
  This paper focuses on the theory of generalized splines. A generalized spline
on a graph $G$ with each edge labeled by an ideal in a ring $R$ consists of a
vertex-labeling by elements of $R$ so that the labels on adjacent vertices $u,
v$ differ by an element of the ideal associated to the edge $uv$. We study the
$R$-module of generalized splines and produce minimum generating sets for
several families of graphs and edge-labelings: $1)$ for all graphs when the set
of possible edge-labelings consists of at most two finitely-generated ideals,
and $2)$ for cycles when the set of possible edge-labelings consists of
principal ideals generated by elements of the form $(ax+by)^2$ in the
polynomial ring $\mathbb{C}[x,y]$. We obtain the generators using a
constructive algorithm that is suitable for computer implementation and give
several applications, including contextualizing several results in the theory
of classical (analytic) splines.

for a long period. However, the locality of CNN requires the model deep enough
to have a global receptive field and such a deep model always leads to the loss
of local details. In this paper, we introduce a new attention-based encoder,
vision transformer, into salient object detection to ensure the globalization
of the representations from shallow to deep layers. With the global view in
very shallow layers, the transformer encoder preserves more local
representations to recover the spatial details in final saliency maps. Besides,
as each layer can capture a global view of its previous layer, adjacent layers
can implicitly maximize the representation differences and minimize the
redundant features, making that every output feature of transformer layers
contributes uniquely for final prediction. To decode features from the
transformer, we propose a simple yet effective deeply-transformed decoder. The
decoder densely decodes and upsamples the transformer features, generating the
final saliency map with less noise injection. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms other FCN-based and transformer-based
methods in five benchmarks by a large margin, with an average of 12.17%
improvement in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Code will be available at

very inefficient, especially for read-dominated workloads. Thus, approaches
such as epoch-based reclamation (EBR), hazard pointers (HP), or a combination
thereof have received significant attention. EBR exhibits excellent performance
but is blocking due to potentially unbounded memory usage. In contrast, HP are
non-blocking and achieve good memory efficiency but are much slower. Moreover,
HP are only lock-free in the general case. Recently, several new memory
reclamation approaches such as WFE and Hyaline have been proposed. WFE achieves
wait-freedom, but is less memory efficient and suffers from suboptimal
performance in oversubscribed scenarios; Hyaline achieves higher performance
and memory efficiency, but lacks wait-freedom.
  We present a new wait-free memory reclamation scheme, Crystalline, that
simultaneously addresses the challenges of high performance, high memory
efficiency, and wait-freedom. Crystalline guarantees complete wait-freedom even
when threads are dynamically recycled, asynchronously reclaims memory in the
sense that any thread can reclaim memory retired by any other thread, and
ensures (an almost) balanced reclamation workload across all threads. The
latter two properties result in Crystalline's high performance and high memory
efficiency. Simultaneously ensuring all three properties require overcoming
unique challenges which we discuss in the paper.
  Crystalline's implementation relies on specialized instructions which are
widely available on commodity hardware such as x86-64 or ARM64. Our
experimental evaluations show that Crystalline exhibits outstanding scalability
and memory efficiency, and achieves superior throughput than typical
reclamation schemes such as EBR as the number of threads grows.

knowledge distillation objective from a standard transformer model. Moreover,
we introduce learned representation compression layers which help reduce by
four times the storage requirement for the cache. In experiments on the SQUAD

each version and maintains only a constant factor more versions than needed
(plus an additive term). It is designed for multiversion schemes using version
lists, which are the most common.
  Our approach uses two components that are of independent interest. First, we
define a novel range-tracking data structure which stores a set of old versions
and efficiently finds those that are no longer needed. We provide a wait-free
implementation in which all operations take amortized constant time. Second, we
represent version lists using a new lock-free doubly-linked list algorithm that
supports efficient (amortized constant time) removals given a pointer to any
node in the list. These two components naturally fit together to solve the
multiversion garbage collection problem--the range-tracker identifies which
versions to remove and our list algorithm can then be used to remove them from
their version lists. We apply our garbage collection technique to generate
end-to-end time and space bounds for the multiversioning system of Wei et al.
(PPoPP 2021).

synthesis (SVS) system. In recent years, DNNs have been utilized in statistical
parametric SVS systems, and DNN-based SVS systems have demonstrated better
performance than conventional hidden Markov model-based ones. SVS systems are
required to synthesize a singing voice with pitch and timing that strictly
follow a given musical score. Additionally, singing expressions that are not
described on the musical score, such as vibrato and timing fluctuations, should
be reproduced. The proposed system is composed of four modules: a time-lag
model, a duration model, an acoustic model, and a vocoder, and singing voices
can be synthesized taking these characteristics of singing voices into account.
To better model a singing voice, the proposed system incorporates improved
approaches to modeling pitch and vibrato and better training criteria into the
acoustic model. In addition, we incorporated PeriodNet, a non-autoregressive
neural vocoder with robustness for the pitch, into our systems to generate a
high-fidelity singing voice waveform. Moreover, we propose automatic pitch
correction techniques for DNN-based SVS to synthesize singing voices with
correct pitch even if the training data has out-of-tune phrases. Experimental
results show our system can synthesize a singing voice with better timing, more
natural vibrato, and correct pitch, and it can achieve better mean opinion
scores in subjective evaluation tests.

their flux densities from MeerKAT 1.3GHz and GMRT 325MHz imaging data are
extracted using the ""super-deblending"" technique. The median radio spectral
index is $\alpha_{\rm 1.3GHz}^{\rm 3GHz}=-0.80\pm0.01$ without significant
variation across the rest-frame frequencies ~1.3-10GHz, indicating radio
spectra dominated by synchrotron radiation. On average, the radio spectrum at
observer-frame 1.3-3GHz slightly steepens with increasing stellar mass with a
linear fitted slope of $\beta=-0.08\pm0.01$, which could be explained by
age-related synchrotron losses. Due to the sensitivity of GMRT 325MHz data, we
apply a further flux density cut at 3GHz ($S_{\rm 3GHz}\ge50\,\mu$Jy) and
obtain a sample of 166 SFGs with measured flux densities at 325MHz, 1.3GHz, and

that the radio spectrum also slightly steepens with increasing stellar mass. By
comparing the far-infrared-radio correlations of SFGs based on different radio
spectral indices, we find that adopting $\alpha_{\rm 1.3GHz}^{\rm 3GHz}$ for
$k$-corrections will significantly underestimate the infrared-to-radio
luminosity ratio ($q_{\rm IR}$) for >17% of the SFGs with measured flux density
at the three radio frequencies in our sample, because their radio spectra are
significantly flatter at low frequency (0.33-1.3GHz).

radio-loud galaxies (ERGs) with radio-loudness parameter of $\log
\mathcal{R}_\mathrm{rest} = \log (f_{1.4

and small number density of $\sim1~$deg$^{-2}$, such ERGs were difficult to
find in the previous wide but shallow, or deep but small area optical surveys.
ERGs show intriguing properties that are different from the conventional RGs:
(1) most ERGs reside above or on the star-forming main-sequence, and some of
them might be low-mass galaxies with $\log (M_\star/M_\odot) < 10$. (2) ERGs
exhibit a high specific black hole accretion rate, reaching the order of the
Eddington limit. The intrinsic radio-loudness ($\mathcal{R}_\mathrm{int}$),
defined by the ratio of jet power over bolometric radiation luminosity, is one
order of magnitude higher than that of radio quasars. This suggests that ERGs
harbor a unique type of active galactic nuclei (AGN) that show both powerful
radiations and jets. Therefore, ERGs are prominent candidates of very rapidly
growing black holes reaching Eddington-limited accretion just before the onset
of intensive AGN feedback.

DR2 by fitting the distribution of stellar parallax and proper motion along a

distributed along the cell boundary. It is third order accurate and does not

focuses on the conceptual extension of Active Flux to include source terms, and
thus for simplicity assumes the homogeneous part of the equations to be linear.
To a large part, the treatment of the source terms is independent of the choice
of the homogeneous part of the system. Additionally, only systems are
considered which admit characteristics (instead of characteristic cones). This
is the case for scalar equations in any number of spatial dimensions and
systems in one spatial dimension. Here, we succeed to extend the Active Flux
method to include (possibly nonlinear) source terms while maintaining third

shown to promote disc formation and promote or hinder outflows. But which
non-ideal process has the greatest impact? Using three-dimensional smoothed
particle radiation non-ideal MHD simulations, we model the gravitational
collapse of a rotating, magnetised cloud through the first hydrostatic core
phase to shortly after the formation of the stellar core. We investigate the
impact of each process individually and collectively. Including any non-ideal
process decreases the maximum magnetic field strength by at least an order of
magnitude during the first core phase compared to using ideal MHD, and promotes
the formation of a magnetic wall. When the magnetic field and rotation vectors
are anti-aligned and the Hall effect is included, rotationally supported discs
of $r \gtrsim 20$~au form; when only the Hall effect is included and the
vectors are aligned, a counter-rotating pseudo-disc forms that is not
rotationally supported. Rotationally supported discs of $r \lesssim 4$~au form
if only Ohmic resistivity or ambipolar diffusion are included. The Hall effect
suppresses first core outflows when the vectors are anti-aligned and suppresses
stellar core outflows independent of alignment. Ohmic resistivity and ambipolar
diffusion each promote first core outflows and delay the launching of stellar
core outflows. Although each non-ideal process influences star formation, these

For typical homogeneous initial states, we find that initially energy is
transferred from the black brane to the perturbative sector, later giving way
to complete transfer of energy to the black brane at a slow and constant rate,
while the entropy grows monotonically for all time. Larger mutual coupling
between the two sectors leads to larger extraction of energy from the black
brane by the boundary perturbative system, but also quicker irreversible
transfer of energy back to the black brane. The quasinormal modes replicate
features of a dissipative system with a softly broken symmetry including the
so-called k-gap. Furthermore, when the mutual coupling is below a critical
value, there exists a hybrid zero mode with finite momentum which becomes
unstable at higher values of momentum, indicating a Gregory-Laflamme type
instability. This could imply turbulent equipartitioning of energy between the

the local Cepheid distance ladder and the early Universe measurements. Strongly
lensed Type Ia supernovae (LSNe Ia) are an independent and direct way to
measure $H_0$, where a time-delay measurement between the multiple supernova
(SN) images is required. In this work, we present two machine learning
approaches for measuring time delays in LSNe Ia, namely, a fully connected
neural network (FCNN) and a random forest (RF). For the training of the FCNN
and the RF, we simulate mock LSNe Ia from theoretical SN Ia models that include
observational noise and microlensing. We test the generalizability of the
machine learning models by using a final test set based on empirical LSN Ia
light curves not used in the training process, and we find that only the RF
provides a low enough bias to achieve precision cosmology; as such, RF is
therefore preferred over our FCNN approach for applications to real systems.
For the RF with single-band photometry in the $i$ band, we obtain an accuracy
better than 1\% in all investigated cases for time delays longer than 15 days,
assuming follow-up observations with a 5$\sigma$ point-source depth of 24.7, a
two day cadence with a few random gaps, and a detection of the LSNe Ia 8 to 10
days before peak in the observer frame. In terms of precision, we can achieve
an approximately 1.5-day uncertainty for a typical source redshift of $\sim$0.8
on the $i$ band under the same assumptions. To improve the measurement, we find
that using three bands, where we train a RF for each band separately and
combine them afterward, helps to reduce the uncertainty to $\sim$1.0 day. We
have publicly released the microlensed spectra and light curves used in this

Gyr. We suggest that cluster mass could be the main parameter driving the inner
expansion, as none of the SCs having $\log (M/M_{\odot}) \leq 3.5$~dex analysed
in this work undergoes to such an expansion. We also detected a mass-size
relationship almost over the entire range of SCs masses investigated here.
Finally, our data suggest that globally the SMC SC system is dynamically
evolved.

mixedness that a local particle detector cannot escape from because of the
entanglement that it must have with the quantum fields outside of the

that weakly coupled localized particle detectors are not impeded from

because these will be published in Gaia's full third data release (DR3),
expected in the first half of 2022. To maximise the usefulness of EDR3, Gaia's
second data release (DR2) sources (with radial velocities) are matched to EDR3
sources to allow their DR2 radial velocities to also be included in EDR3. This
presents two considerations: (i) arXiv:1901.10460 (hereafter B19) published a
list of 70,365 sources with potentially contaminated DR2 radial velocities; and
(ii) EDR3 is based on a new astrometric solution and a new source list, which
means sources in DR2 may not be in EDR3. EDR3 contains 7,209,831 sources with a
DR2 radial velocity, which is 99.8% of sources with a radial velocity in DR2.
14,800 radial velocities from DR2 are not propagated to any EDR3 sources
because (i) 3871 from the B19 list are found to either not have an unpublished,
preliminary DR3 radial velocity or it differs significantly from its DR2 value,
and 5 high-velocity stars not in the B19 list are confirmed to have
contaminated radial velocities; and (ii) 10,924 DR2 sources could not be
satisfactorily matched to any EDR3 sources, so their DR2 radial velocities are
also missing from EDR3. The reliability of radial velocities in EDR3 has
improved compared to DR2 because the update removes a small fraction of
erroneous radial velocities (0.05% of DR2 radial velocities and 5.5% of the B19
list). Lessons learnt from EDR3 (e.g. bright star contamination) will improve
the radial velocities in future Gaia data releases. The main reason for radial
velocities from DR2 not propagating to EDR3 is not related to DR2 radial
velocity quality. It is because the DR2 astrometry is based on one component of
close binary pairs, while EDR3 astrometry is based on the other component,
which prevents these sources from being unambiguously matched. (Abridged)

towards the diversity in imaging conditions and pathologies typical for
real-world clinical applications. To overcome these limitations, we utilized
contrastive self-supervised learning to exploit the large variety of unlabeled
fundus images in the publicly available EyePACS dataset. We pre-trained an
encoder of a U-Net, which we later fine-tuned on several retinal vessel and
lesion segmentation datasets. We demonstrate for the first time that by using
contrastive self-supervised learning, the pre-trained network can recognize
blood vessels, optic disc, fovea, and various lesions without being provided
any labels. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on a downstream blood vessel
segmentation task, such pre-trained networks achieve state-of-the-art
performance on images from different datasets. Additionally, the pre-training
also leads to shorter training times and an improved few-shot performance on
both blood vessel and lesion segmentation tasks. Altogether, our results
showcase the benefits of contrastive self-supervised pre-training which can
play a crucial role in real-world clinical applications requiring robust models

state parameter from CMB lensing tomography, that is the combination of galaxy
clustering and the cross-correlation of galaxies with CMB lensing in a number
of redshift bins. In particular, we consider the two-point correlation
functions which can be formed with a catalog of galaxy locations and
photometric redshifts from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space
and Time (LSST) and CMB lensing maps from the CMB-S4 experiment. We focus on
the analytic understanding of the origin of the constraints. Dark energy
information in these data arises from the influence of three primary
relationships: distance as a function of redshift (geometry), the amplitude of
the power spectrum as a function of redshift (growth), and the power spectrum
as a function of wavenumber (shape). We find that the effects from geometry and
growth play a significant role and partially cancel each other out, while the
shape effect is unimportant. We also show that Dark Energy Task Force (DETF)
Figure of Merit (FoM) forecasts from the combination of LSST galaxies and
CMB-S4 lensing are comparable to the forecasts from cosmic shear in the absence
of the CMB lensing map, thus providing an important independent check. Compared
to the forecasts with the LSST galaxies alone, combining CMB lensing and LSST
clustering information (together with the primary CMB spectra) increases the
FoM by roughly a factor of 3-4 in the optimistic scenario where systematics are
fully under control. We caution that achieving these forecasts will likely
require a full analysis of higher-order biasing, photometric redshift
uncertainties, and stringent control of other systematic limitations, which are
outside the scope of this work, whose primary purpose is to elucidate the
physical origin of the constraints.

innovations. Multi User Multiple Input Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) is one of the
most promising schemes. This has been evolved into Massive MIMO technology in
5G to further stretch the network throughput. Massive MIMO tackles the rising
data rate with the increase in the number of antenna. This comes at the price
of a higher energy consumption. Moreover the high velocity users in MU-MIMO
scheme experiences a frequent unpredictable change in the channel condition
that degrade its downlink performance. Therefore a proper number of antenna
selection is of paramount importance. This issue has been addressed using
machine learning techniques and Channel State Information (CSI) but only for
static users. In this study we propose to introduce antenna diversity in
spatial multiplexing MU-MIMO transmission scheme by operating more number of
reception antenna compare to the number of transmission antenna. The diversity
improves the downlink performance of high velocity users. In general our
results can be interpreted for large scale antenna systems like Massive MIMO.
The proposed method can be easily implemented in the existing network
architectures with minimal complexity. Also it has the potential for solving
real-life problems like call drops and low data rate to be experienced by

physics arising from flavor-diagonal charge-parity (${\cal{CP}}$) violation.
Among these species, the largest ${\cal{P,T}}$-violating molecular interaction
constants -- associated for example with the electron electric dipole moment --
are obtained for the combination of radium (Ra) and silver (Ag) atoms. A
mechanism for explaining this finding is proposed. We go on to discuss the

trapped RaAg molecules, and argue that this system is particularly promising

agriculture, the environment, and medicine. However, existing models of
spreading typically focus on cells in unconfined settings--despite the fact
that many bacteria inhabit complex and crowded environments, such as soils,
sediments, and biological tissues/gels, in which solid obstacles confine the
cells and thereby strongly regulate population spreading. Here, we develop an
extended version of the classic Keller-Segel model of bacterial spreading that
incorporates the influence of confinement in promoting both cell-solid and
cell-cell collisions. Numerical simulations of this extended model demonstrate
how confinement fundamentally alters the dynamics and morphology of spreading
bacterial populations, in good agreement with recent experimental results. In
particular, with increasing confinement, we find that cell-cell collisions
increasingly hinder the initial formation and the long-time propagation speed
of chemotactic pulses. Moreover, also with increasing confinement, we find that
cellular growth and division plays an increasingly dominant role in driving
population spreading--eventually leading to a transition from chemotactic
spreading to growth-driven spreading via a slower, jammed front. This work thus
provides a theoretical foundation for further investigations of the influence
of confinement on bacterial spreading. More broadly, these results help to
provide a framework to predict and control the dynamics of bacterial
populations in complex and crowded environments.

  Speedup","27 pages",,,,"quant-ph cs.LG cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Quantum computing offers the potential of exponential speedups for certain
classical computations. Over the last decade, many quantum machine learning
(QML) algorithms have been proposed as candidates for such exponential
improvements. However, two issues unravel the hope of exponential speedup for
some of these QML algorithms: the data-loading problem and, more recently, the
stunning dequantization results of Tang et al. A third issue, namely the
fault-tolerance requirements of most QML algorithms, has further hindered their
practical realization. The quantum topological data analysis (QTDA) algorithm
of Lloyd, Garnerone and Zanardi was one of the first QML algorithms that
convincingly offered an expected exponential speedup. From the outset, it did
not suffer from the data-loading problem. A recent result has also shown that
the generalized problem solved by this algorithm is likely classically
intractable, and would therefore be immune to any dequantization efforts.
However, the QTDA algorithm of Lloyd et~al. has a time complexity of
$O(n^4/(\epsilon^2 \delta))$ (where $n$ is the number of data points,
$\epsilon$ is the error tolerance, and $\delta$ is the smallest nonzero
eigenvalue of the restricted Laplacian) and requires fault-tolerant quantum
computing, which has not yet been achieved. In this paper, we completely
overhaul the QTDA algorithm to achieve an improved exponential speedup and
depth complexity of $O(n\log(1/(\delta\epsilon)))$. Our approach includes three
key innovations: (a) an efficient realization of the combinatorial Laplacian as
a sum of Pauli operators; (b) a quantum rejection sampling approach to restrict
the superposition to the simplices in the complex; and (c) a stochastic rank
estimation method to estimate the Betti numbers. We present a theoretical error
analysis, and the circuit and computational time and depth complexities for
Betti number estimation.

distinct intra - and inter-population coupling have served as simple model
systems for chimera states since they possess an invariant synchronized
manifold, in contrast to networks on a spatial structure. Here, we study
dynamical and spectral properties of finite-sized chimeras on two-population
networks. First, we elucidate how the Kuramoto order parameter of the finite
sized globally coupled two-population network of phase oscillators is connected
to that of the continuum limit. These findings suggest that it is suitable to
classify the chimera states according to their order parameter dynamics, and
therefore we define Poisson and Non-Poisson chimera states. We then perform a
Lyapunov analysis of these two types of chimera states which yields insight
into the full stability properties of the chimera trajectories as well as of
collective modes. In particular, our analysis also confirms that Poisson
chimeras are neutrally stable. We then introduce two types of ""perturbation""
that act as small heterogeneities and render Poisson chimeras attracting: A
topological variation via the simplest nonlocal intra-population coupling that
keeps the network symmetries, and the allowance of amplitude variations in the
globally coupled two-population network, i.e., we replace the phase oscillators
by Stuart-Landau oscillators. The Lyapunov spectral properties of chimera
states in the two modified networks are investigated, exploiting an ansatz

gyrokinetic simulations of ion-gyroradius-scale modes in axisymmetric toroidal
magnetic fields, the nonadiabatic response of passing electrons can drive the
mode, and generate fluctuations with narrow radial layers, which may have
consequences for turbulent transport in a variety of circumstances. In flux
tube simulations, in the ballooning representation, these instabilities reveal
themselves as modes with extended tails. The small electron-to-ion mass ratio
limit of linear gyrokinetics for electrostatic instabilities is presented, in
axisymmetric toroidal magnetic geometry, including the nonadiabatic response of
passing electrons and associated narrow radial layers. This theory reveals the
existence of ion-gyroradius-scale modes driven solely by the nonadiabatic

driven by the response of ions and trapped electrons, where the nonadiabatic

magnetoresistance, we report unprecedented metamagnetic phase transitions in
atomically-thin CrOCl, triggered by magnetic easy-axis flipping instead of the
conventional spin flop mechanism. Few-layer CrOCl tunnelling devices of various
thicknesses consistently show an in-plane antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state
with the easy axis aligned along the Cr-O-Cr direction (b-axis). Strikingly,
with the presence of a magnetic field perpendicular to the easy-axis (H||c),
magnetization of CrOCl does not follow the prevalent spin rotation and
saturation pattern, but rather exhibits an easy-axis flipping from the in-plane
to out-of-plane directions. Such magnetic anisotropy controlled metamagnetic
phase transitions are manifested by a drastic upturn in tun- nelling current,
which shows anomalous shifts towards higher H when temperature increases. By 2D
mapping of tunnelling currents as a function of both temperature and H, we
determine a unique ferrimagnetic state with a superstructure periodicity of
five unit cells after the field-induced metam- agnetic transitions. The
feasibility to control 2D magnetism by manipulating magnetic anisotropy may
open enormous opportunities in spin-based device applications.

that includes the as-designed part as well as the sacrificial support
structures that need to be machined away by subtractive manufacturing (SM), for
instance multi-axis machining. Thus, although AM is capable of generating
highly complex parts, the limitations of SM due to possible collision between
the milling tool and the workpiece can render an optimized part
non-manufacturable. We present a systematic approach to topology optimization
(TO) of parts for AM followed by SM to ensure removability of support
structures, while optimizing the part's performance. A central idea is to
express the producibility of the part from the near-net shape in terms of
accessibility of every support structure point using a given set of cutting
tool assemblies and fixturing orientations. Our approach does not impose any
artificial constraints on geometric complexity of the part, support structures,
machining tools, and fixturing devices. We extend the notion of inaccessibility
measure field (IMF) to support structures to identify the inaccessible points
and capture their contributions to non-manufacturability by a continuous
spatial field. IMF is then augmented to the sensitivity field to guide the TO
towards a manufacturable design. The approach enables efficient and effective
design space exploration by finding nontrivial complex designs whose near-net
shape can be 3D printed and post-processed for support removal by machining
with a custom set of tools and fixtures. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
approach on nontrivial examples in 2D and 3D.

their ability to utilize the instance-specific statistics of a video. However,
these methods have a large inference time as they require thousands of gradient

presentAdaptiveVideoSuper-Resolution (Ada-VSR) which leverages external, as

The ZSAR task aims to recognize target (unseen) actions without training

challenging to semantically represent action classes and transfer knowledge
from seen data. In this work, we propose an ER-enhanced ZSAR model inspired by

elaborating a new concept and relating it to known concepts. Specifically, we
expand each action class as an Elaborative Description (ED) sentence, which is
more discriminative than a class name and less costly than manual-defined
attributes. Besides directly aligning class semantics with videos, we
incorporate objects from the video as Elaborative Concepts (EC) to improve
video semantics and generalization from seen actions to unseen actions. Our

anomalous exponent associated with a given particle trajectory, thus
determining whether the particle subdiffuses, superdiffuses or performs normal

often important to trustingly identify the model behind the trajectory, as this
gives a large amount of information on the system dynamics. Both aspects are
particularly difficult when the input data are short and noisy trajectories. It
is even more difficult if one cannot guarantee that the trajectories output in

nature. However, simulating bulk materials fully at these scales is not
feasible, so that typically homogenized continuum descriptions are used
instead. A seamless and lossless transition of the constitutive description of
the elastic response of materials between these two scales has been so far
elusive. Here we show how this problem can be overcome by using Artificial
Intelligence (AI). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is trained, by
taking the structure image of a nanoporous material as input and the
corresponding elasticity tensor, calculated from Molecular Statics (MS), as
output. Trained with the atomistic data, the CNN model captures the size- and
pore-dependency of the material's elastic properties which, on the physics
side, can stem from surfaces and non-local effects. Such effects are often
ignored in upscaling from atomistic to classical continuum theory. To
demonstrate the accuracy and the efficiency of the trained CNN model, a Finite
Element Method (FEM) based result of an elastically deformed nanoporous beam
equipped with the CNN as constitutive law is compared with that by a full
atomistic simulation. The good agreement between the atomistic simulations and
the FEM-AI combination for a system with size and surface effects establishes a
new lossless scale bridging approach to such problems. The trained CNN model
deviates from the atomistic result by 9.6\% for porosity scenarios of up to
90\% but it is about 230 times faster than the MS calculation and does not
require to change simulation methods between different scales. The efficiency
of the CNN evaluation together with the preservation of important atomistic
effects makes the trained model an effective atomistically-informed
constitutive model for macroscopic simulations of nanoporous materials and
solving of inverse problems.

operational or environmental constraints may require alternative methods.
Spreading and levitation of clusters (aggregates) of fumed silica nanoparticles
placed under atmospheric pressure on a hot plate is reported. In a closed
chamber, the particles started to spread horizontally at the threshold
temperature of $T_c^*=403 \pm 1$K. The powder spreading in the chamber
continued until the temperature-dependent saturation value $r_{sat} (T)$, which
grew linearly with the temperature. Open space experiments clearly demonstrated
levitation of the powder clouds. The onset of levitation in the open space
corresponded to the minimal threshold temperature of $T_o^*=373 \pm 1$K.
Qualitative physical analysis of the observed phenomena is suggested. The
effect of levitation is explained by the lifting thermo-phoretic force emerging
in the Knudsen layer of air on the heater surface. The levitation of the powder
under atmospheric pressure becomes possible due to the combination of low
adhesion of the fluorinated fumed silica clusters built of nanoparticles to the
substrate, relatively low density of the particles and clusters, and their high
specific surface area. Ordering of the aggregates of nanoparticles within the

navigation have only demonstrated that human languages facilitate communication
by instructions in natural languages. Nevertheless, a plethora of other forms
of communication is left unexplored. In fact, human communication originated in
gestures and oftentimes is delivered through multimodal cues, e.g. ""go there""
with a pointing gesture. To bridge the gap and fill in the missing dimension of
communication in embodied agent navigation, we propose investigating the
effects of using gestures as the communicative interface instead of verbal
cues. Specifically, we develop a VR-based 3D simulation environment, named
Ges-THOR, based on AI2-THOR platform. In this virtual environment, a human
player is placed in the same virtual scene and shepherds the artificial agent
using only gestures. The agent is tasked to solve the navigation problem guided
by natural gestures with unknown semantics; we do not use any predefined
gestures due to the diversity and versatile nature of human gestures. We argue
that learning the semantics of natural gestures is mutually beneficial to
learning the navigation task--learn to communicate and communicate to learn. In
a series of experiments, we demonstrate that human gesture cues, even without
predefined semantics, improve the object-goal navigation for an embodied agent,
outperforming various state-of-the-art methods.

on the kagome lattice by employing Gutzwiller-projected fermionic wave
functions. Within this framework, different states can be represented, defined
by distinct unprojected fermionic Hamiltonians that include hopping and pairing
terms, as well as a coupling to local Zeeman fields to generate magnetic order.
For $J_2=0$, the so-called U(1) Dirac state, in which only hopping is present
(such as to generate a $\pi$-flux in the hexagons), has been shown to
accurately describe the exact ground state [Y. Iqbal, F. Becca, S. Sorella, and
D. Poilblanc, Phys. Rev. B 87, 060405 (2013); Y.-C. He, M. P. Zaletel, M.
Oshikawa, and F. Pollmann, Phys. Rev. X 7, 031020 (2017)]. Here, we show that
its accuracy improves in presence of a small antiferromagnetic super-exchange
$J_2$, leading to a finite region where the gapless spin liquid is stable;
then, for $J_2/J_1=0.11(1)$, a first-order transition to a magnetic phase with
pitch vector ${\bf q}=(0,0)$ is detected, by allowing magnetic order within the
fermionic Hamiltonian. Instead, for small ferromagnetic values of $|J_2|/J_1$,
the situation is more contradictory. While the U(1) Dirac state remains stable
against several perturbations in the fermionic part (i.e., dimerization
patterns or chiral terms), its accuracy clearly deteriorates on small systems,
most notably on $36$ sites where exact diagonalization is possible. Then, upon
increasing the ratio $|J_2|/J_1$, a magnetically ordered state with $\sqrt{3}
\times \sqrt{3}$ periodicity eventually overcomes the U(1) Dirac spin liquid.
Within the ferromagnetic $J_{2}$ regime, evidence is shown in favor of a
first-order transition at $J_2/J_1=-0.065(5)$.

positive and exact for certain finite-dimensional function spaces (and weight
functions). Although there are several efficient procedures to construct
positive and exact cubature formulas for many standard cases, it remains a
challenge to do so in a more general setting. Here, we show how the method of
least squares can be used to derive provable positive and exact formulas in a
general multi-dimensional setting. Thereby, the procedure only makes use of
basic linear algebra operations, such as solving a least squares problem. In
particular, it is proved that the resulting least squares cubature formulas are
ensured to be positive and exact if a sufficiently large number of
equidistributed data points is used. We also discuss the application of
provable positive and exact least squares cubature formulas to construct nested
stable high-order rules and positive interpolatory formulas. Finally, our
findings shed new light on some existing methods for multivariate numerical
integration and under which restrictions these are ensured to be successful.

a J-curve pattern, however the timing and the size of the contributions and

a benchmark model and present two novel approaches (direct vs. indirect) to
predict the cash flows of private equity funds. We introduce a sliding window
approach to apply on our cash flow data because different vintage year funds
contain different lengths of cash flow information. We then pass the data to an
LSTM/ GRU model to predict the future cash flows either directly or indirectly
(based on the benchmark model). We further integrate macroeconomic indicators
into our data, which allows us to consider the impact of market environment on
cash flows and to apply stress testing. Our results indicate that the direct
model is easier to implement compared to the benchmark model and the indirect
model, but still the predicted cash flows align better with the actual cash
flows. We also show that macroeconomic variables improve the performance of the
direct model whereas the impact is not obvious on the indirect model.

flare, observed with the ARTEMIS-JLS radiospectro-graph on February 12, 2010.
The event was associated with a surge observed at 195 and 304 {\AA} and with a
coronal mass ejection observed by instruments on-board STEREO A and B near the
East and West limbs respectively. On the disk the event was observed at 10
frequencies by the Nancay Radioheliograph, in Ha by the Catania observatory, in
soft x-rays by GOES SXI and Hinode XRT and in hard x-rays by RHESSI. We
combined these data, together with MDI longitudinal magnetograms, to get as
complete a picture of the event as possible. Our emphasis is on two type-II
bursts that occurred near respective maxima in the GOES light curves. The
first, associated with the main peak of the event, showed an impressive F-H
structure, while the emission of the second consisted of three well-separated
bands with superposed pulsations. Using positional information for the type-IIs
from the NRH and triangulation from STEREO A and B, we found that the type IIs
were associated neither with the surge nor with the disruption of a nearby
streamer, but rather with an EUV wave probably initiated by the surge. The
fundamental-harmonic structure of the first type II showed a band split
corresponding to a magnetic field strength of 18G, a frequency ratio of 1.95
and a delay of 0.23-0.65s of the fundamental with respect to the harmonic;
moreover it became stationary shortly after its start and then drifted again.
The pulsations superposed on the second type II were broadband and had started
before the burst. In addition, we detected another pulsating source, also
before the second type II, polarized in the opposite sense; the pulsations in
the two sources were out of phase and hence hardly detectable in the dynamic
spectrum. The pulsations had a measurable reverse frequency drift of about 2/s.

for linear nonlocal equations with possibly very irregular coefficients of

equations with VMO coefficients such a gain of Sobolev regularity along the
differentiability scale is unattainable, it was already observed in previous
works that gaining differentiability in our nonlocal setting is possible under
less restrictive assumptions than in the local setting. In this paper, we
follow this direction and show that under assumptions on the right-hand side
that allow for an arbitrarily small gain of integrability, weak solutions $u
\in W^{s,2}$ in fact belong to $W^{t,p}_{loc}$ for any $s \leq t <
\min\{2s,1\}$, where $p>2$ reflects the amount of integrability gained. In

general smaller gain of differentiability was proved.

properties of Wiener-chaos variables, since $\rho (T)$ and its discrete version

This methodology accesses the Kolmogorov distance thanks to a relation which
stems from the connection between the Malliavin calculus and Stein's method on

mmWave Radar (3DRIMR), a deep learning based architecture that reconstructs 3D
shape of an object in dense detailed point cloud format, based on sparse raw
mmWave radar intensity data. The architecture consists of two back-to-back
conditional GAN deep neural networks: the first generator network generates 2D
depth images based on raw radar intensity data, and the second generator
network outputs 3D point clouds based on the results of the first generator.
The architecture exploits both convolutional neural network's convolutional
operation (that extracts local structure neighborhood information) and the
efficiency and detailed geometry capture capability of point clouds (other than
costly voxelization of 3D space or distance fields). Our experiments have
demonstrated 3DRIMR's effectiveness in reconstructing 3D objects, and its

case, each client is a potential business organization/company with a solid

graph-based analytics approach to improve CRM within a B2B environment. In our
approach, in the first instance, we have designed a graph database using the
Neo4j platform. Secondly, the graph database has been investigated by using
data mining and exploratory analysis coupled with cypher graph query language.
Specifically, we have applied the graph convolution network (GCN) to enable CRM
analytics to forecast sales. This is the first step towards a GCN-based binary
classification based on graph databases in the domain of B2B CRM. We evaluate
the performance of the proposed GCN model on graph databases and compare it
with Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Artificial
Neural Network (ANN). The proposed GCN approach is further augmented with the
shortest path and eigenvector centrality attribute to significantly improve the
accuracy of sales prediction. Experimental results reveal that the proposed
graph-based deep learning approach outperforms the Random Forests (RsF) and two
deep learning models, i.e., CNN and ANN under different combinations of graph
features.

follow a universal trend at which the sizes scale with the square-root of the

size-luminosity diagram indicates that the inner regions of discs around young
stars scale with luminosity independently of the stellar mass. At the targeted
scales (2-300 au), the MYSO binary fraction is lower than what was previously
reported for the more evolved main sequence massive stars, which, if further
confirmed, could implicate the predictions from massive binary formation
theories. Lastly, we spatially resolve the crucial star/disc interface in a

profound research interest has emerged to understand the innate immune response
to viruses. This understanding can help to inhibit virus replication, prolong
adaptive immune response, accelerated virus clearance, and tissue recovery, a
key milestone to propose a vaccine to combat coronaviruses (CoVs), e.g.,
Covid-19. Although an innate immune system triggers inflammatory responses
against CoVs upon recognition of viruses, however, a vaccine is the ultimate
protection against CoV spread. The development of this vaccine is
time-consuming and requires a deep understanding of the innate immune response
system. In this work, we propose a graph neural network-based model that
exploits the interactions between pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), i.e.,
the human immune response system. These interactions can help to recognize
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to predict the activation
requirements of each PRR. The immune response information of each PRR is
derived from combining its historical PAMPs activation coupled with the modeled
effect on the same from PRRs in its neighborhood. On one hand, this work can
help to understand how long Covid-19 can confer immunity where a strong immune
response means people already been infected can safely return to work. On the
other hand, this GNN-based understanding can also abode well for vaccine
development efforts. Our proposal has been evaluated using CoVs immune response

our paper is the fact that realizability of a Gauss diagram can be expressed

one of chord diagrams corresponding to the graph). Several studies contain
theorems purporting to prove the fact. We check several of these descriptions
experimentally and find counterexamples to the descriptions of realizable Gauss

realizable circle graphs and present an elegant algorithm for checking if a
circle graph is realizable. We enumerate realizable circle graphs for small

photo-realistic face images of a person's whole life, given only one snapshot
as reference. The generated face image given a target age code is expected to
be age-sensitive reflected by bio-plausible transformations of shape and
texture, while being identity preserving. This is extremely challenging because
the shape and texture characteristics of a face undergo separate and highly
nonlinear transformations w.r.t. age. Most recent LFS models are based on
generative adversarial networks (GANs) whereby age code conditional
transformations are applied to a latent face representation. They benefit
greatly from the recent advancements of GANs. However, without explicitly
disentangling their latent representations into the texture, shape and identity
factors, they are fundamentally limited in modeling the nonlinear age-related
transformation on texture and shape whilst preserving identity. In this work, a
novel LFS model is proposed to disentangle the key face characteristics
including shape, texture and identity so that the unique shape and texture age
transformations can be modeled effectively. This is achieved by extracting
shape, texture and identity features separately from an encoder. Critically,
two transformation modules, one conditional convolution based and the other
channel attention based, are designed for modeling the nonlinear shape and
texture feature transformations respectively. This is to accommodate their
rather distinct aging processes and ensure that our synthesized images are both
age-sensitive and identity preserving. Extensive experiments show that our LFS
model is clearly superior to the state-of-the-art alternatives. Codes and demo

this problem by defining a Bayesian quantifier for uncertainty suitable for the

limited resources using a single class of probe states. We find that, in
noiseless systems, entanglement between qubits always decreases the uncertainty
of the estimation; however, the quantum advantage decreases as fewer qubits are
used in the estimation. We also find that the presence of strong dephasing

hot, OBA stars with effective temperature (Teff) higher than 7500K. This fills
a gap in the scientific analysis of large spectroscopic stellar surveys such as
LAMOST, which offers spectra for millions of stars at R=1800. We first explore
the theoretical information content of such spectra for determining stellar
labels, via the Cram\'er-Rao bound. We show that in the limit of perfect model
spectra and observed spectra with S/N of 100, precise estimates are possible
for a wide range of stellar labels: not only the effective temperature Teff,
surface gravity logg, and projected rotation velocity vsini, but also the
micro-turbulence velocity, Helium abundance and the elemental abundances [C/H],
[N/H], [O/H], [Si/H], [S/H], and [Fe/H]. Our analysis illustrates that the
temperature regime of around 9500K is challenging, as the dominant Balmer and
Paschen line strength vary little with Teff. We implement the simultaneous
fitting of these 11 stellar labels to LAMOST hot-star spectra using the Payne
approach, drawing on Kurucz's ATLAS12/SYNTHE LTE spectra as the underlying
models. We then obtain stellar parameter estimates for a sample of about
330,000 hot stars with LAMOST spectra, an increase by about two orders of
magnitude in sample size. Among them, about 260,000 have good Gaia parallaxes
(S/N>5), and more than 95 percent of them are luminous stars, mostly on the
main sequence; the rest reflects lower luminosity evolved stars, such as hot
subdwarfs and white dwarfs. We show that the fidelity of the abundance
estimates is limited by the systematics of the underlying models, as they do
not account for NLTE effects. Finally, we show the detailed distribution of
vsini of stars with 8000-15,000K, illustrating that it extends to a sharp
cut-off at the critical rotation velocity, across a wide range of temperatures.

sciences. Of particular interest is the problem to reconcile observed marginal
distributions with a given prior posed by E. Schrodinger in 1932/32 and known
as the Schrodinger Bridge Problem (SBP). Due to its fundamental significance,
interest in SBP has in recent years enticed a broad spectrum of disciplines.
Yet, while the mathematics and applications of SBP have been developing at a
considerable pace, accounting for marginals of unequal mass has received scant
attention; the problem to interpolate between unbalanced marginals has been
approached by introducing source/sink terms in an Adhoc manner. Nevertheless,
losses are inherent in many physical processes and, thereby, models that
account for lossy transport may also need to be reconciled with observed
marginals following Schrodinger's dictum; that is, to adjust the probability of
trajectories of particles, including those that do not make it to the terminal
observation point, so that the updated law represents the most likely way that
particles may have been transported, or vanished, at some intermediate point.
Thus, the purpose of this work is to develop such a natural generalization of
the SBP for stochastic evolution with losses, whereupon particles are ""killed""
according to a probabilistic law. Through a suitable embedding, we turn the
problem into an SBP for stochastic processes that combine diffusive and jump
characteristics. Then, following a large-deviations formalism, given a prior
law that allows for losses, we ask for the most probable evolution of particles
along with the most likely killing rate as the particles transition between the
specified marginals. Our approach differs sharply from previous work involving
a Feynman-Kac multiplicative reweighing of the reference measure: The latter,
as we argue, is far from Schrodinger's quest.

Although concepts like anger or awe are abstract, there is a shared consensus

We cannot travel back to earlier periods to study emotion concepts directly,
but we can examine text corpora, which have partially preserved the meaning of
emotion words. Using natural language processing of historical text, we found
evidence for semantic change in emotion words over the past century and that
varying rates of change were predicted in part by an emotion concept's
prototypicality - how representative it is of the broader category of
""emotion"". Prototypicality negatively correlated with historical rates of
emotion semantic change obtained from text-based word embeddings, beyond more
established variables including usage frequency in English and a second
comparison language, French. This effect for prototypicality did not
consistently extend to the semantic category of birds, suggesting its relevance
for predicting semantic change may be category-dependent. Our results suggest
emotion semantics are evolving over time, with prototypical emotion words
remaining semantically stable, while other emotion words evolve more freely.

first phase, IoT devices harvest energy from the UAV through wireless power
transfer; and then in a second phase, the UAV collects data from the IoT
devices through information transmission. To characterise the agility of the
UAV, we consider two scenarios: a hovering UAV and a mobile UAV. Aiming at
maximizing the total network sum-rate, we jointly optimize the trajectory of
the UAV, the energy harvesting scheduling of IoT devices, and the phaseshift

reinforcement learning algorithms to solve the optimization problem of
maximizing the total network sum-rate. Numerical results illustrate the
effectiveness of the UAV's flying path optimization and the network's

underdeveloped. In this study, we calculate the spin angular momenta of host
stars and the orbital angular momenta of their planets using data from the NASA
Exoplanet Archive, together with detailed analysis of observation dependent

different evolutionary stages. In addition, we use a population of planets from
theoretical model simulations to reexamine the observed patterns and compare
the simulated population with the observed samples to assess variations and
differences. We found the majority of exoplanets discovered thus far do not

observational biases, the model simulated angular momentum distributions are
comparable to the observed pattern in general. However, the differences between
the observation and model simulation in the parameter (angular momentum) space
provide more rigorous constraints and insights on the issues that needed future
improvement.

convolutional layer into two layers: a convolutional layer with the orthonormal
basis vectors as the filters, and a layer that we name ""BasisScalingConv"",
which is responsible for rescaling the features and transforming them back to
the original space. As the filters in each transformed layer are linearly
independent with known relative importance, pruning can be more effective and
stable, and fine tuning individual weights is unnecessary. Furthermore, as the
numbers of input and output channels of the original convolutional layer remain
unchanged, basis pruning is applicable to virtually all network architectures.
Basis pruning can also be combined with existing pruning algorithms for double
pruning to further increase the pruning capability. With less than 1% reduction
in the classification accuracy, we can achieve pruning ratios up to 98.9% in

Usually, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are applied to inference problems,
but they present some disadvantages, particularly when comparing different
models fitted to the same dataset. Other Bayesian methods can deal with this
issue in a natural and effective way. We have implemented an importance
sampling algorithm adapted to Bayesian inference problems in which the power of

importance sampling is that the model evidence can be derived directly from the
so-called importance weights -- while MCMC methods demand considerable
postprocessing. The use of our adaptive target, adaptive importance sampling
(ATAIS) method is shown by inferring, on the one hand, the parameters of a
simulated flaring event which includes a damped oscillation {and, on the other
hand, real data from the Kepler mission. ATAIS includes a novel automatic
adaptation of the target distribution. It automatically estimates the variance
of the noise in the model. ATAIS admits parallelisation, which decreases the
computational run-times notably. We compare our method against a nested
sampling method within a model selection problem.

a photometric time series upon a trial period - leading to a coherent stack
when using the correct value. Such phase-folded transits have become a standard
data visualisation in modern transit discovery papers. There is no analogous
folding mechanism for exomoons, which would have to represent some kind of
double-fold; once for the planet and then another for the moon. Folding with
the planet term only, a moon imparts a small decrease in the surrounding
out-of-transit averaged intensity, but its incoherent nature makes it far less
convincing than the crisp stacks familiar to exoplanet hunters. Here, a new
approach is introduced that can be used to achieve the transit origami needed
to double fold an exomoon, in the case where a planet exhibits TTVs. This
double fold has just one unknown parameter, the satellite-to-planet mass ratio,
and thus a simple one-dimensional grid search can be used to rapidly identify
power associated with candidate exomoons. The technique is demonstrated on
simulated light curves, exploring the breakdown limits of close-in and/or
inclined satellites. As an example, the method is deployed on Kepler-973b, a
warm mini-Neptune exhibiting an 8 minute TTV, where the possibility that the
TTVs are caused by a single exomoon is broadly excluded, with upper limits
probing down to a Ganymede-sized moon.

issues and trade-offs, e.g., improving equality, productivity, or wellness, and
poses a complex mechanism design problem. A policy designer needs to consider
multiple objectives, policy levers, and behavioral responses from strategic
actors who optimize for their individual objectives. Moreover, real-world
policies should be explainable and robust to simulation-to-reality gaps, e.g.,
due to calibration issues. Existing approaches are often limited to a narrow
set of policy levers or objectives that are hard to measure, do not yield
explicit optimal policies, or do not consider strategic behavior, for example.
Hence, it remains challenging to optimize policy in real-world scenarios. Here
we show that the AI Economist framework enables effective, flexible, and
interpretable policy design using two-level reinforcement learning (RL) and
data-driven simulations. We validate our framework on optimizing the stringency
of US state policies and Federal subsidies during a pandemic, e.g., COVID-19,
using a simulation fitted to real data. We find that log-linear policies
trained using RL significantly improve social welfare, based on both public
health and economic outcomes, compared to past outcomes. Their behavior can be
explained, e.g., well-performing policies respond strongly to changes in
recovery and vaccination rates. They are also robust to calibration errors,
e.g., infection rates that are over or underestimated. As of yet, real-world
policymaking has not seen adoption of machine learning methods at large,

subsets of variables obtained for different cases. An example is the split
questionnaire design (SQD), which is adopted to reduce respondent fatigue and
improve response rates by assigning different subsets of the questionnaire to
different sampled respondents. A general question then is how to estimate the
regression function based on such block-wise observed data. Currently, this is
often carried out with the aid of missing data methods, which may unfortunately
suffer intensive computational cost, high variability, and possible large
modeling biases in real applications. In this article, we develop a novel
approach for estimating the regression function for SQD-type data. We first
construct a list of candidate models using available data-blocks separately,
and then combine the estimates properly to make an efficient use of all the
information. We show the resulting averaged model is asymptotically optimal in
the sense that the squared loss and risk are asymptotically equivalent to those
of the best but infeasible averaged estimator. Both simulated examples and an
application to the SQD dataset from the European Social Survey show the promise
of the proposed method.

stations has been a popular research topic for several decades. Although many
AUV and dock designs have been proposed, materialized, and commercialized, most
of these existing designs prioritize the functionality of the AUV over the
dock, or vise versa; there has been limited formal research in analytical
optimization for AUV docking systems. In this paper, a multidisciplinary
optimization framework is presented with the aim to fill this theoretical gap.
We propose a co-design optimization method that optimizes multiple design
parameters governing the archetype of an AUV and its docking system. Capturing
the user design intents in the optimization process, the proposed method
produces a set of optimal design parameters that satisfies a set of predefined
bounds, constraints, and initial conditions. Three cases of design optimization
are reported for different design intents. Each optimal design found in the
three cases is compared to an existing system to show the validity of this

Slowly pulsating B (SPB) stars are main-sequence multi-periodic
oscillators that display non-radial gravity modes. For a fraction of these
pulsators, 4-year photometric light curves obtained with the Kepler space
telescope reveal period spacing patterns from which their internal rotation and
mixing can be inferred. In this inference, any direct resonant mode coupling
has usually been ignored so far.
  Aims. We re-analysed the light curves of a sample of 38 known Kepler SPB
stars. For 26 of those, the internal structure, including rotation and mixing,
was recently inferred from their dipole prograde oscillation modes. Our aim is
to detect direct nonlinear resonant mode coupling among the largest-amplitude
gravity modes.
  Methods. We extract up to 200 periodic signals per star with five different
iterative prewhitening strategies based on linear and nonlinear regression
applied to the light curves. We then identify candidate coupled gravity modes
by verifying whether they fulfil resonant phase relations.
  Results. For 32 of 38 SPB stars we find at least 1 candidate resonance that
is detected in both the linear and the best nonlinear regression model fit to
the light curve and involves at least one of the two largest-amplitude modes.
  Conclusions. The majority of the Kepler SPB stars reveal direct nonlinear
resonances based on the largest-amplitude modes. These stars are thus prime
targets for nonlinear asteroseismic modelling of intermediate-mass dwarfs to
assess the importance of mode couplings in probing their internal physics.

the unit ball has convex combination of slices of arbitrarily small diameter

explore the stability of these with properties in the light of three space

relation between two sentences, which is widely used in various natural
language tasks, such as Natural Language Inference (NLI), Paraphrase
Identification (PI), and so on. Much recent progress has been made in this
area, especially attention-based methods and pre-trained language model based
methods. However, most of these methods focus on all the important parts in
sentences in a static way and only emphasize how important the words are to the
query, inhibiting the ability of attention mechanism. In order to overcome this
problem and boost the performance of attention mechanism, we propose a novel
dynamic re-read attention, which can pay close attention to one small region of
sentences at each step and re-read the important parts for better sentence
representations. Based on this attention variation, we develop a novel Dynamic
Re-read Network (DRr-Net) for sentence semantic matching. Moreover, selecting
one small region in dynamic re-read attention seems insufficient for sentence
semantics, and employing pre-trained language models as input encoders will
introduce incomplete and fragile representation problems. To this end, we
extend DRrNet to Locally-Aware Dynamic Re-read Attention Net (LadRa-Net), in
which local structure of sentences is employed to alleviate the shortcoming of
Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) in pre-trained language models and boost the
performance of dynamic reread attention. Extensive experiments on two popular
sentence semantic matching tasks demonstrate that DRr-Net can significantly
improve the performance of sentence semantic matching. Meanwhile, LadRa-Net is
able to achieve better performance by considering the local structures of
sentences. In addition, it is exceedingly interesting that some discoveries in
our experiments are consistent with some findings of psychological research.

wireless cellular network, where UAVs serve several users with the help of
multiple RISs. We jointly optimize the deployment, user scheduling, beamforming
vector, and RIS phases to maximize the sum-rate, with the constraints of the
minimum rate, the UAV movement, the analog beamforming, and the RIS phases. To
solve this complex problem, we use an iterative method, in which when we
optimize one variable, we fix the other three variables. When optimizing the
deployment, we find the optimal position for the UAV by a sphere search. Then,
we formulate a mixed-integer non-linear problem (MINLP) to find the best
scheduling. A spatial branch-and-bound (sBnB) method is used to solve the
MINLP. When Optimizing the beamforming vector and the RIS phases, we propose an
iterative algorithm that relies on the equivalence between the maximization of
the sum-rate and the minimization of the summation of weighted mean-square
errors (sum-WMMSE). The majority-minimization method is used to deal with the
constant-modulus constraints for the analog beamforming and RIS phases. The
proposed joint optimization offers significant advantages over the system

deployment optimization. In addition, the RIS can compensate for the loss of
throughput due to the blockage, especially in low flight altitudes.

VRDs, structured text understanding has been a challenging task. Most existing
studies decoupled this problem into two sub-tasks: entity labeling and entity
linking, which require an entire understanding of the context of documents at
both token and segment levels. However, little work has been concerned with the
solutions that efficiently extract the structured data from different levels.
This paper proposes a unified framework named StrucTexT, which is flexible and
effective for handling both sub-tasks. Specifically, based on the transformer,
we introduce a segment-token aligned encoder to deal with the entity labeling
and entity linking tasks at different levels of granularity. Moreover, we
design a novel pre-training strategy with three self-supervised tasks to learn
a richer representation. StrucTexT uses the existing Masked Visual Language
Modeling task and the new Sentence Length Prediction and Paired Boxes Direction
tasks to incorporate the multi-modal information across text, image, and
layout. We evaluate our method for structured text understanding at
segment-level and token-level and show it outperforms the state-of-the-art
counterparts with significantly superior performance on the FUNSD, SROIE, and
EPHOIE datasets.

retrieve candidate images via similarity search using global image features and
then re-rank the candidates by leveraging their local features. Previous
learning-based studies mainly focus on either global or local image
representation learning to tackle the retrieval task. In this paper, we abandon
the two-stage paradigm and seek to design an effective single-stage solution by

attentively extracts representative local information with multi-atrous
convolutions and self-attention at first. Components orthogonal to the global
image representation are then extracted from the local information. At last,
the orthogonal components are concatenated with the global representation as a
complementary, and then aggregation is performed to generate the final
representation. The whole framework is end-to-end differentiable and can be
trained with image-level labels. Extensive experimental results validate the
effectiveness of our solution and show that our model achieves state-of-the-art

medical treatment or sensor placing of wild animals. In these applications,
continuously targeting the moving animal is a crucial requirement. Due to the
underactuated characteristics of the quadrotor and the coupled kinematics with
the animal, nonlinear optimal tracking approaches, other than smooth feedback
control, are required. However, with severe nonlinearities, it would be
time-consuming to evaluate control inputs, and real-time tracking may not be
achieved with generic optimizers onboard. To tackle this problem, a novel
efficient egocentric regulation approach with high computational efficiency is
proposed in this paper. Specifically, it directly formulates the optimal
tracking problem in an egocentric manner regarding the quadrotor's body
coordinates. Meanwhile, the nonlinearities of the system are peeled off through
a mapping of the feedback states as well as control inputs, between the
inertial and body coordinates. In this way, the proposed efficient egocentric
regulator only requires solving a quadratic performance objective with linear
constraints and then generate control inputs analytically. Comparative
simulations and mimic biological experiment are carried out to verify the
effectiveness and computational efficiency. Results demonstrate that the
proposed control approach presents the highest and stablest computational
efficiency than generic optimizers on different platforms. Particularly, on a
commonly utilized onboard computer, our method can compute the control action
in approximately 0.3 ms, which is on the order of 350 times faster than that of
generic nonlinear optimizers, establishing a control frequency around 3000 Hz.

a low frequency Planck spectrum (soft x-rays) and a high frequency Gaussian
spectrum (hard x-rays, commonly termed as ""M-band"") on a planar foil of the
ablator. The fraction of energy density in the hard x-ray spectrum ($\alpha$)
has been varied from 0 to 0.25. The predominant effect of hard x-rays is to
preheat the ablator ahead of the shock front. Steady rise in preheat
temperature and shock breakout temperature is observed on increasing the
fraction of hard x-rays. Preheating can be mitigated by doping Be with a mid-Z
element Cu as its opacity is much higher in the high frequency region. On
doping Be with 1\% Cu, the shock velocities decrease slightly compared to pure
Be. However, higher shock velocities are observed on increasing the fraction of
M-band. We observe significant decrease in shock breakout and maximum preheat
temperature in doped Be foil. Steady rise in these temperatures is observed on
increasing $\alpha$. We have proposed new scaling relations for shock velocity,
shock breakout temperature, maximum preheat temperature and mass ablation rate
with the radiation temperature and the fraction of M-band energy density in
both pure and doped Be ablators. In terms of ablator performance, Cu doped Be
ablator is found to be superior to pure Be. Though doping significantly reduces

develop a disentangled image dehazing network (DID-Net), which disentangles the
feature representations into three component maps, i.e. the latent haze-free
image, the transmission map, and the global atmospheric light estimate,
respecting the physical model of a haze process. Our DID-Net predicts the three
component maps by progressively integrating features across scales, and refines
each map by passing an independent refinement network. Then a
disentangled-consistency mean-teacher network (DMT-Net) is employed to
collaborate unlabeled real data for boosting single image dehazing.
Specifically, we encourage the coarse predictions and refinements of each
disentangled component to be consistent between the student and teacher
networks by using a consistency loss on unlabeled real data. We make comparison
with 13 state-of-the-art dehazing methods on a new collected dataset (Haze4K)

virtual link that is characterized by the use of one IP address. If a frame is

links there is an interruption, then the link that is still connected will be
able to maintain the connection so that frame transmission continues, this
working system is called link redundancy. To monitor the condition of the link
whether it is connected or broken, a mechanism called link-monitoring is used.
The monitoring link used in this final project is Media Independent Interface
(MII). The test step is to implement a Bonding Interface network for the use of
video streaming, VoIP, and file transfer. The analysis carried out is a
failover test that uses a connection switching time parameter and a QoS test
with packet loss, delay, jitter, and throughput parameters. The results will
then be compared with a network that does not use a Bonding Interface, which is
a network that is only connected using one link. From the results of the
research conducted is that the Bonding Interface system is able to perform a
redundancy mechanism when one of the links is broken/down to an
active/connected link and the services that are run are not interrupted.
Bonding Interface is also able to provide network stability compared to
networks that do not use a Bonding Interface, this is characterized by a
smaller jitter value than the use of a network with one link.

driving. At the same time, these models introduce new vulnerabilities that may
compromise the safety of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, recent studies have
demonstrated that adversarial attacks can cause a significant decline in
detection precision of deep learning-based 3D object detection models. Although
driving safety is the ultimate concern for autonomous driving, there is no
comprehensive study on the linkage between the performance of deep learning
models and the driving safety of autonomous vehicles under adversarial attacks.
In this paper, we investigate the impact of two primary types of adversarial
attacks, perturbation attacks and patch attacks, on the driving safety of
vision-based autonomous vehicles rather than the detection precision of deep
learning models. In particular, we consider two state-of-the-art models in
vision-based 3D object detection, Stereo R-CNN and DSGN. To evaluate driving
safety, we propose an end-to-end evaluation framework with a set of driving
safety performance metrics. By analyzing the results of our extensive
evaluation experiments, we find that (1) the attack's impact on the driving
safety of autonomous vehicles and the attack's impact on the precision of 3D
object detectors are decoupled, and (2) the DSGN model demonstrates stronger
robustness to adversarial attacks than the Stereo R-CNN model. In addition, we
further investigate the causes behind the two findings with an ablation study.
The findings of this paper provide a new perspective to evaluate adversarial
attacks and guide the selection of deep learning models in autonomous driving.

issues, e.g., undernutrition, obesity and many non-communicable diseases. An
indispensable part of the health diet is dietary assessment. Traditional manual
recording methods are not only burdensome but time-consuming, and contain
substantial biases and errors. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI),
especially computer vision technologies, have made it possible to develop
automatic dietary assessment solutions, which are more convenient, less
time-consuming and even more accurate to monitor daily food intake. Scope and
approach: This review presents Vision-Based Dietary Assessment (VBDA)
architectures, including multi-stage architecture and end-to-end one. The
multi-stage dietary assessment generally consists of three stages: food image
analysis, volume estimation and nutrient derivation. The prosperity of deep
learning makes VBDA gradually move to an end-to-end implementation, which
applies food images to a single network to directly estimate the nutrition. The
recently proposed end-to-end methods are also discussed. We further analyze
existing dietary assessment datasets, indicating that one large-scale benchmark
is urgently needed, and finally highlight critical challenges and future trends
for VBDA. Key findings and conclusions: After thorough exploration, we find
that multi-task end-to-end deep learning approaches are one important trend of
VBDA. Despite considerable research progress, many challenges remain for VBDA
due to the meal complexity. We also provide the latest ideas for future
development of VBDA, e.g., fine-grained food analysis and accurate volume
estimation. This review aims to encourage researchers to propose more practical
solutions for VBDA.

takes the clinicians excessive time to review a large number of images
extracted from colonoscopy videos. Thus, automatic detection of biological
anatomical landmarks within the colon is highly demanded, which can help reduce
the burden of clinicians by providing guidance information for the locations of
lesion areas. In this article, we propose a novel deep learning-based approach
to detect biological anatomical landmarks in colonoscopy videos. First, raw
colonoscopy video sequences are pre-processed to reject interference frames.
Second, a ResNet-101 based network is used to detect three biological
anatomical landmarks separately to obtain the intermediate detection results.
Third, to achieve more reliable localization of the landmark periods within the
whole video period, we propose to post-process the intermediate detection
results by identifying the incorrectly predicted frames based on their temporal
distribution and reassigning them back to the correct class. Finally, the
average detection accuracy reaches 99.75\%. Meanwhile, the average IoU of 0.91
shows a high degree of similarity between our predicted landmark periods and
ground truth. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model is
capable of accurately detecting and localizing biological anatomical landmarks

The high quality of diversity can be achieved when each model is specialized to

knows to which subsets it is specialized, more opportunities arise to improve
diversity. In this paper, we propose an advanced ensemble method, called
Auxiliary class based Multiple Choice Learning (AMCL), to ultimately specialize
each model under the framework of multiple choice learning (MCL). The
advancement of AMCL is originated from three novel techniques which control the
framework from different directions: 1) the concept of auxiliary class to
provide more distinct information through the labels, 2) the strategy, named
memory-based assignment, to determine the association between the inputs and
the models, and 3) the feature fusion module to achieve generalized features.

using an elaborate circuitry of chemical reactions which, puzzlingly, bear a
strict restriction to asymmetric chiral configurations. While autocatalysis is
known to promote such chiral symmetry breaking, whether a similar phenomenon
may also be induced in a more general class of configurable chemical systems --
via energy exploitation -- is a sensible yet underappreciated possibility. This
work examines this question within a model of randomly generated complex
chemical networks. We show that chiral symmetry breaking may occur
spontaneously and generically by harnessing energy sources from external
environmental drives. Key to this transition are intrinsic fluctuations of
achiral-to-chiral reactions and tight matching of system configurations to the
environmental drives, which together amplify and sustain diverged enantiomer
distributions. These asymmetric states emerge through steep energetic
transitions from the corresponding symmetric states and sharply cluster as
highly-dissipating states. The results thus demonstrate a generic mechanism in
which energetic drives may give rise to homochirality in an otherwise totally
symmetrical environment, and from an early-life perspective, might emerge as a
competitive, energy-harvesting advantage.

transient spiral wave chimera-like states and investigate the long time
behavior of these states. The transition from the transient spiral chimera-like
pattern to the long time synchronized or desynchronized pattern appears through
the deformation of the incoherent region of the spiral core. We discuss the
transient dynamics under the influence of the species diffusion at different
time instants. By calculating the instantaneous strength of incoherence of the
populations, we estimate the duration of the transient dynamics characterized
by the persistence of the chimera-like spatial coexistence of coherent and
incoherent patterns over the spatial domain. We generalize our observations on

the FS-UDA setting, we develop a general UDA model to solve the following two
key issues: the few-shot labeled data per category and the domain adaptation
between support and query sets. Our model is general in that once trained it
will be able to be applied to various FS-UDA tasks from the same source and
target domains. Inspired by the recent local descriptor based few-shot learning
(FSL), our general UDA model is fully built upon local descriptors (LDs) for
image classification and domain adaptation. By proposing a novel concept called
similarity patterns (SPs), our model not only effectively considers the spatial
relationship of LDs that was ignored in previous FSL methods, but also makes
the learned image similarity better serve the required domain alignment.
Specifically, we propose a novel IMage-to-class sparse Similarity Encoding

for classification and meanwhile aligns the covariance matrix of the SPs for
domain adaptation. Also, domain adversarial training and multi-scale local

heavy workload to re-extract features of the whole database every time.Feature
compatibility enables the learned new visual features to be directly compared
with the old features stored in the database. In this way, when updating the
deployed model, we can bypass the inflexible and time-consuming feature
re-extraction process. However, the old feature space that needs to be
compatible is not ideal and faces the distribution discrepancy problem with the
new space caused by different supervision losses. In this work, we propose a
global optimization Dual-Tuning method to obtain feature compatibility against
different networks and losses. A feature-level prototype loss is proposed to
explicitly align two types of embedding features, by transferring global
prototype information. Furthermore, we design a component-level mutual
structural regularization to implicitly optimize the feature intrinsic
structure. Experimental results on million-scale datasets demonstrate that our
Dual-Tuning is able to obtain feature compatibility without sacrificing
performance. (Our code will be avaliable at

finite volume (FV) scheme for the solution of the general relativistic
magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) equations and the first order CCZ4 formulation
(FO-CCZ4) of the Einstein field equations of general relativity, as well as the
fully coupled FO-CCZ4 + GRMHD system. These systems of first order hyperbolic
PDEs allow to study the dynamics of the matter and the dynamics of the
space-time according to the theory of general relativity.
  The new well balanced finite volume scheme presented here exploits the
knowledge of an equilibrium solution of interest when integrating the
conservative fluxes, the nonconservative products and the algebraic source
terms, and also when performing the piecewise linear data reconstruction. This
results in a rather simple modification of the underlying second order FV
scheme, which, however, being able to cancel numerical errors committed with
respect to the equilibrium component of the numerical solution, substantially
improves the accuracy and long-time stability of the numerical scheme when
simulating small perturbations of stationary equilibria. In particular, the
need for well balanced techniques appears to be more and more crucial as the
applications increase their complexity. We close the paper with a series of
numerical tests of increasing difficulty, where we study the evolution of small
perturbations of accretion problems and stable TOV neutron stars. Our results
show that the well balancing significantly improves the long-time stability of
the finite volume scheme compared to a standard one.

programs is hard: it may be due to an incorrectness in the program, an
incompleteness in the program annotations, or an incompleteness of the prover.
The changes needed to resolve a proof failure depend on its category, but the
prover cannot provide any help on the categorisation. When using an SMT solver
to discharge a proof obligation, that solver can propose a model from a failed
attempt, from which a possible counterexample can be derived. But the
counterexample may be invalid, in which case it may add more confusion than
help. To check the validity of a counterexample and to categorise the proof
failure, we propose the comparison between the run-time assertion-checking
(RAC) executions under two different semantics, using the counterexample as an
oracle. The first RAC execution follows the normal program semantics, and a
violation of a program annotation indicates an incorrectness in the program.
The second RAC execution follows a novel ""giant-step"" semantics that does not
execute loops nor function calls but instead retrieves return values and values
of modified variables from the oracle. A violation of the program annotations
only observed under giant-step execution characterises an incompleteness of the
program annotations. We implemented this approach in the Why3 platform for
deductive program verification and evaluated it using examples from prior

in crowd images. Recently, several methods have been proposed for
semi-supervised crowd counting to reduce the labeling efforts. Given a limited
labeling budget, they typically select a few crowd images and densely label all
individuals in each of them. Despite the promising results, we argue the
None-or-All labeling strategy is suboptimal as the densely labeled individuals
in each crowd image usually appear similar while the massive unlabeled crowd
images may contain entirely diverse individuals. To this end, we propose to
break the labeling chain of previous methods and make the first attempt to
reduce spatial labeling redundancy for semi-supervised crowd counting. First,
instead of annotating all the regions in each crowd image, we propose to
annotate the representative ones only. We analyze the region representativeness
from both vertical and horizontal directions, and formulate them as cluster
centers of Gaussian Mixture Models. Additionally, to leverage the rich
unlabeled regions, we exploit the similarities among individuals in each crowd
image to directly supervise the unlabeled regions via feature propagation
instead of the error-prone label propagation employed in the previous methods.
In this way, we can transfer the original spatial labeling redundancy caused by
individual similarities to effective supervision signals on the unlabeled
regions. Extensive experiments on the widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that
our method can outperform previous best approaches by a large margin.

photons is modest, as in, e.g., M87, such changes can give rise to delayed,
strong TeV flares, dominated by curvature emission of particles accelerated in
the gap. The flare rise time, and the delay between the external variation and
the onset of the flare emitted from the outer gap boundary, are of the order of
the light crossing time of the gap. The rapid, large amplitude TeV flares
observed in M87 and, perhaps, other AGNs may be produced by such a mechanism.

the derived segmentation, we design a crowd-aware domain adaptation mechanism
consisting of two crowd-aware adaptation modules, i.e., Crowd Region Transfer

own crowd density distribution. Our method outperforms previous approaches

pressure-driven flows in micro-channels of variable cross-section. This fast
and accurate model is valid for long channels, but allows for large variations

expansion of the governing equations in the aspect ratio of the channel. A
finite Fourier transform in the plane normal to the flow direction is used to
solve for the leading order axial velocity. The corresponding pressure and
transverse velocity are obtained via a hybrid analytic-numerical scheme based
on recursion. The channel geometry is such that one of the transverse velocity
components is negligible, and the other component, in the plane of variation of
channel height, is obtained from combination of the corresponding momentum
equation and the continuity equations, assuming a low degree polynomial Ansatz
of the pressure forcing. A key feature of the model is that it puts no
restriction on the time dependence of the pressure forcing, in terms of shape
and frequency, as long as the advective component of the inertia term is small.
This is a major departure from many previous expositions which assume harmonic
forcing. The model reveals to be accurate for a wide range of parameters and is
two orders of magnitude faster than conventional three dimensional CFD

briefly divided into two phases: \textbf{idea reasoning} and \textbf{surface

aims to arrange the most appropriate sentence to depict and convey the
information distilled from the main idea. However, the current popular
token-by-token text generation methods ignore this crucial process and suffer
from many serious issues, such as idea/topic drift. To tackle the problems and
realize this two-phase paradigm, we propose a new framework named Sentence
Semantic Regression (\textbf{SSR}) based on sentence-level language modeling.
For idea reasoning, two architectures \textbf{SSR-AR} and \textbf{SSR-NonAR}
are designed to conduct sentence semantic regression autoregressively (like
GPT2/3) and bidirectionally (like BERT). In the phase of surface realization, a
mixed-granularity sentence decoder is designed to generate text with better

strategy that optimizes a single sampling trajectory at a time. 2D SPARKLING
actually performs variable density sampling (VDS) along a prescribed target
density while maximizing sampling efficiency and meeting the gradient-based
hardware constraints. However, 3D SPARKLING has remained limited in terms of
acceleration factors along the third dimension if one wants to preserve a peaky
point spread function (PSF) and thus good image quality. In this paper, in
order to achieve higher acceleration factors in 3D imaging while preserving

remains valid if one tests the identical vanishing only on geometric
generalized Wronskians. It turns out that geometric generalized Wronskians
allow to define intrinsic objects on projective varieties polarized with an
ample line bundle: in this setting, the lack of existence of global functions
is compensated by global sections of powers of the fixed ample line bundle.
Geometric generalized Wronskians are precisely defined so that their local
evaluations on such global sections globalize up to a positive twist by the
ample line bundle. We then give three applications of the construction of
geometric generalized Wronskians: one in intermediate hyperbolicity, and two in
foliation theory. In intermediate hyperbolicity, we show the algebraic
degeneracy of holomorphic maps from C p to a Fermat hypersurface in P N of

results, namely for p = 1 (first proved via Nevanlinna theory) and p = N -- 1

application in foliation theory provides a criterion for algebraic
integrability of leaves of foliations: our criterion is not optimal in view of
current knowledges, but has the advantage of having an elementary proof. Our
second application deals with positivity properties of adjoint line bundles of

can correct multiple structures simultaneously and add structures missed at
initial segmentation. We report an improvement of 13.3, 12.5, 17.8, 10.2, and
12.4 times in user annotation time than full human annotation for the nucleus,
multiple cells, liver and tumor, organ, and brain segmentation respectively. We
report a time saving of 2.8, 3.0, 1.9, 4.4, and 8.6 fold compared to other

diagnosis and post-surgical follow-up with minimal intervention from the

  Treatment: Status Quo",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The aortic vessel tree is composed of the aorta and its branching arteries,
and plays a key role in supplying the whole body with blood. Aortic diseases,
like aneurysms or dissections, can lead to an aortic rupture, whose treatment
with open surgery is highly risky. Therefore, patients commonly undergo drug
treatment under constant monitoring, which requires regular inspections of the
vessels through imaging. The standard imaging modality for diagnosis and
monitoring is computed tomography (CT), which can provide a detailed picture of
the aorta and its branching vessels if completed with a contrast agent, called
CT angiography (CTA). Optimally, the whole aortic vessel tree geometry from
consecutive CTAs is overlaid and compared. This allows not only detection of
changes in the aorta, but also of its branches, caused by the primary pathology
or newly developed. When performed manually, this reconstruction requires slice
by slice contouring, which could easily take a whole day for a single aortic
vessel tree, and is therefore not feasible in clinical practice. Automatic or
semi-automatic vessel tree segmentation algorithms, however, can complete this
task in a fraction of the manual execution time and run in parallel to the
clinical routine of the clinicians. In this paper, we systematically review
computing techniques for the automatic and semi-automatic segmentation of the
aortic vessel tree. The review concludes with an in-depth discussion on how
close these state-of-the-art approaches are to an application in clinical
practice and how active this research field is, taking into account the number

the sum-of-exponential approximation to reduce the cost of evaluating the
history part. FIR is the numerical scheme originally proposed in [16], and FIDR
is an alternative scheme proposed in [26], and we show that the latter is
superior when $\alpha$ is small. With quantitative estimates, we prove that
given a certain error threshold, the computational cost of evaluating the
history part of the Caputo derivative can be decreased as $\alpha$ gets small.
Hence, only minimal cost for the fast evaluation is required in the small
$\alpha$ regime, which matches prevailing protocols in engineering practice. We
also present improved stability and error analysis of FIDR for solving linear
fractional diffusion equations, which achieves clear dependence of the error
bound on the fraction order $\alpha$. Finally, we carry out systematic
numerical studies for the performances of both FIR and FIDR schemes, where we
explore the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency when $\alpha$ is small.

the local prior information of the image, a total variation (TV) regularization

minimization with total variation model (TLNMTV). Both proposed models are
convex and therefore have global optimal solutions. Moreover, we adopt the
Alternating Direction Multiplier Method (ADMM) to obtain the closed-form
solution of each variable, thus ensuring the feasibility of the algorithm.
Numerical experiments show that the two proposed algorithms are convergent and

are far less flexible to scissoring type deformations than the octahedra in the
related compound ScF$_3$. These results support the idea that structural
flexibility is an important factor in NTE materials, allowing the phonon modes
that drive a volume contraction of the lattice to occupy a greater volume in
reciprocal space. The lack of flexibility in ReO$_3$ restricts the NTE-driving
phonons to a smaller region of reciprocal space, limiting the magnitude and

severity of an incident and decide which service to contact for corrective
actions. To automate these decisions, several predictive models have been
proposed, but the most efficient models are opaque (say, black box), strongly
limiting their adoption. In this paper, we propose an efficient black box model
based on 170K incidents reported to our company over the last 7 years and
emphasize on the need of automating triage when incidents are massively
reported on thousands of servers running our product, an ERP. Recent
developments in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) help in providing

explanations for each model prediction/outcome. Sadly, providing a human with
an explanation for each outcome is not conceivable when dealing with an
important number of daily predictions. To address this problem, we propose an
original data-mining method rooted in Subgroup Discovery, a pattern mining
technique with the natural ability to group objects that share similar
explanations of their black box predictions and provide a description for each
group. We evaluate this approach and present our preliminary results which give
us good hope towards an effective OCE's adoption. We believe that this approach

reasoning capacities has received increasing interest within the last years.
Particular attention is given to the formalism of epistemic logic programs
(ELPs) where standard rules are equipped with modal operators which allow to
express conditions on literals for being known or possible, i.e., contained in
all or some answer sets, respectively. ELPs thus deliver multiple collections
of answer sets, known as world views. Employing ELPs for reasoning problems so
far has mainly been restricted to standard decision problems (complexity
analysis) and enumeration (development of systems) of world views. In this
paper, we take a next step and contribute to epistemic logic programming in two
ways: First, we establish quantitative reasoning for ELPs, where the acceptance
of a certain set of literals depends on the number (proportion) of world views
that are compatible with the set. Second, we present a novel system that is
capable of efficiently solving the underlying counting problems required to
answer such quantitative reasoning problems. Our system exploits the
graph-based measure treewidth and works by iteratively finding and refining
(graph) abstractions of an ELP program. On top of these abstractions, we apply
dynamic programming that is combined with utilizing existing search-based
solvers like (e)clingo for hard combinatorial subproblems that appear during
solving. It turns out that our approach is competitive with existing systems
that were introduced recently. This work is under consideration for acceptance
in TPLP.

weighted fair sequences problem, which is a recently introduced NP-hard
sequencing problem with applications in diverse areas such as TV advertisement
scheduling, periodic machine maintenance and real-time scheduling. In the
problem we are given an upper bound on the allowed solution sequence length and
a list of symbols. For each symbols, there is a positive weight and a number,
which gives the minimum times the symbol has to occur in a feasible solution
sequence. The goal is to find a feasible sequence, which minimizes the maximum
weight-distance product, which is calculated for each consecutive appearance of
each symbol in the sequence, including the last and first appearance in the
sequence, i.e., the sequence is considered to be circular for the calculation
of the objective function. Our proposed solution algorithm is based on a new
mixed-integer programming model for the problem for a fixed sequence length.
The model is enhanced with valid inequalities and variable fixings. We also
develop an extended model, which allows the definition of an additional set of
valid inequalities and present additional results which can allow us to skip
the solution of the mixed-integer program for some sequence lengths. We conduct
a computational study on the instances from literature to assess the efficiency
of our newly proposed solution approach. Our approach manages to solve 404 of
440 instances to optimality within the given timelimit, most of them within
five minutes. The previous best existing solution approach for the problem only
managed to solve 229 of these instances, and its exactness depends on an

is a difficult task, one regime that allows for analytical results is the
so-called noncontact regime, where a probe is weakly interacting with the
surface over which it moves. Studying this regime for a model crystal, we
extend previously obtained analytical results and confirm them quantitatively
via particle based computer simulations. Accessing the subtle regime of weak
coupling in simulations is possible via use of Green-Kubo relations. The
analysis allows to extract and compare the two paradigmatic mechanisms that
have been found to lead to dissipation: phonon radiation, prevailing even in a
purely elastic solid, and phonon damping, e.g., caused by viscous motion of
crystal atoms. While phonon radiation is dominant at large probe-surface
distances, phonon damping dominates at small distances. Phonon radiation is
furthermore a pairwise additive phenomenon so that the dissipation due to
interaction with different parts (areas) of the surface adds up. This additive
scaling results from a general one-to-one mapping between the mean
probe-surface force and the friction due to phonon radiation, irrespective of
the nature of the underlying pair interaction. In contrast, phonon damping is
strongly nonadditive, and no such general relation exists. We show that for
certain cases, the dissipation can even {\it decrease} with increasing surface
area the probe interacts with. The above properties, which are rooted in the
spatial correlations of surface fluctuations, are expected to have important
consequences when interpreting experimental measurements, as well as scaling
with system size.

Crucially, the resulting loop-level integrands are automatically CK-dual, up to
potential Jacobian counterterms required for unitarity. While these
counterterms may break CK duality, they exist, are unique and, since the
tree-level is unaffected, may be deduced from the action or the integrands.
Consequently, CK duality is a symmetry of the action like any other symmetry,
and it is anomalous in a controlled and mostly harmless sense. Our results
apply to any theory with CK-dual tree-level amplitudes. We also show that two
CK duality-manifesting parent actions may be factorized and fused into a

for fast adaptation to a new class. However, given that as few as a single
support set image is available, effective model adaption of all three
components to the new class is extremely challenging. In this work we propose
to simplify the meta-learning task by focusing solely on the simplest
component, the classifier, whilst leaving the encoder and decoder to
pre-training. We hypothesize that if we pre-train an off-the-shelf segmentation
model over a set of diverse training classes with sufficient annotations, the
encoder and decoder can capture rich discriminative features applicable for any
unseen classes, rendering the subsequent meta-learning stage unnecessary. For
the classifier meta-learning, we introduce a Classifier Weight Transformer
(CWT) designed to dynamically adapt the supportset trained classifier's weights
to each query image in an inductive way. Extensive experiments on two standard

communication interfaces with diverse characteristics. This enables exploiting
a form of multi-connectivity known as interface diversity to provide path
diversity with multiple communication interfaces. Interface diversity helps to
combat the problems suffered by single-interface systems due to error bursts in
the link, which are a consequence of temporal correlation in the wireless
channel. The length of an error burst is an essential performance indicator for
cyber-physical control applications with periodic traffic, as these define the
period in which the control link is unavailable. However, the available
interfaces must be correctly orchestrated to achieve an adequate trade-off
between latency, reliability, and energy consumption. This work investigates
how the packet error statistics from different interfaces impacts the overall
latency-reliability characteristics and explores mechanisms to derive adequate
interface diversity policies. For this, we model the optimization problem as a
partially observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where the state of each
interface is determined by a Gilbert-Elliott model whose parameters are
estimated based on experimental measurement traces from LTE and Wi-Fi. Our
results show that the POMDP approach provides an all-round adaptable solution,

scientific community and the public. This project is based on the simple idea
of writing short articles with an approximate reading time of two minutes.
These articles cover several topics and their difficulty scales to cover a
broad audience range, from young students to experienced adults. We support the
idea of <<ask an expert>> in Astrophysics in Greece, where any reader can pose
a question. We offer the appropriate answer either by writing it ourselves or
by contacting the field experts from the Greek astronomical society.
Furthermore, our previous science communication experience leads us to design
educational activities for students and/or adults based on pedagogical means. A
successful one was an <<escape-zoom>> titled <<Escape to Other Worlds>>, a
digital version of an escape room. Further activities are Astronomy workshops
for teenagers, online talks to schools, and our participation in a scientific
podcast to trigger the public interest in Astrophysics. We communicate this

To combat this, we propose an energy-based model (EBM) that learns a
low-dimensional representation of the variables by employing a noise
contrastive loss function. With our EBM we introduce a preprocessing step that
alleviates the dimensionality curse for any existing learner developed for
estimating CATEs. We prove that our EBM keeps the representations partially
identifiable up to some universal constant, as well as having universal
approximation capability. These properties enable the representations to
converge and keep the CATE estimates consistent. Experiments demonstrate the
convergence of the representations, as well as show that estimating CATEs on
our representations performs better than on the variables or the
representations obtained through other dimensionality reduction methods.

this paper formulates a precoding optimization problem with antenna selection;
yet acquiring the optimal joint precoding and antenna selection solution is
challenging due to the intricate EE characterization. To resolve this
challenge, we decompose the problem into precoding direction and power
optimization problems. For precoding direction, we characterize the first-order
optimality condition, which entails the effects of quantization distortion and
antenna selection. For precoding power, we obtain the optimum solution using a
gradient descent algorithm to maximize EE for given precoding direction. We
cast the derived condition as a functional eigenvalue problem, wherein finding
the principal eigenvector attains the best local optimal point. To this end, we
propose generalized power iteration based algorithm. Alternating these two
methods, our algorithm identifies a joint solution of the active antenna set
and the precoding direction and power. In simulations, the proposed methods
provide considerable performance gains. Our results suggest that a few-bit DACs

missing piece of the Standard Model of particle physics, any hint of new
physics has been intensively searched for, with no confirmation to date. There
are however slight deviations from the SM that are worth investigating. The CMS
collaboration has reported, in a search for heavy resonances decaying in $t
\bar t$ with a 13-TeV center-of-mass energy and a luminosity of 35.9 fb$^{-1}$,
deviations from the SM predictions at the 3.5$\sigma$ level locally
(1.9$\sigma$ after the look-elsewhere effect). In addition, in the ditau final
state search performed by the ATLAS collaboration at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV and
$\mathcal{L}=139$ fb$^{-1}$, deviations from the SM at the 2$\sigma$ level have
been also observed. Interestingly, both slight excesses are compatible with a
new pseudoscalar boson with a mass around 400 GeV that couples at least to
fermions of the third generation and gluons. Starting from a purely
phenomenological perspective, we inspect the possibility that a 400-GeV
pseudoscalar can account for these deviations and at the same time satisfy the
constraints on the rest of the channels that it gives contributions to and that
are analyzed by the ATLAS and CMS experiments. After obtaining the range of
effective couplings compatible with all experimental measurements, we study the
gauge invariant UV completions that can give rise to this type of pseudoscalar
resonance, which can be accommodated in an $SO(6)/SO(5)$ model with consistency
at the 1$\sigma$ level and in a $SO(5)\times U(1)_{P}\times
U(1)_{X}/SO(4)\times U(1)_X$ at the 2$\sigma$ level, while exceedingly large
quartic couplings would be necessary to account for it in a general two Higgs

a configuration which assigns one of the two states on or off to each vertex.
The aim of the game is to turn all vertices to off state for an initial
configuration by activating some vertices where each activation switches the
state of the vertex and all of its neighbors. If the aim of the game can be
accomplished for all initial configurations then $G$ is called always solvable.
We call the dimension of the kernel of the closed neighborhood matrix of the
graph over the field $\mathbb{Z}_2$, nullity of $G$. It turns out that $G$ is
always solvable if and only if its nullity is zero. We investigate the problem
of how nullity changes when an edge is added to or removed from a graph. As a
result we characterize always solvable graphs. We also showed that for every
graph with positive nullity there exists an edge whose removal decreases the
nullity. Conversely, we showed that for every always solvable graph which is
not an even graph with odd order, there exists an edge whose addition increases
the nullity.

  Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recent theoretical and experimental advances show that the inertia of
magnetization emerges at sub-picoseconds and contributes to the ultrafast
magnetization dynamics which cannot be captured intrinsically by the LLG
equation. Therefore, as a generalization, the inertial Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
(iLLG) equation is proposed to model the ultrafast magnetization dynamics.
Mathematically, the LLG equation is a nonlinear system of parabolic type with
(possible) degeneracy. However, the iLLG equation is a nonlinear system of
mixed hyperbolic-parabolic type with degeneracy, and exhibits more complicated
structures. It behaves like a hyperbolic system at the sub-picosecond scale
while behaves like a parabolic system at larger timescales. Such hybrid
behaviors impose additional difficulties on designing numerical methods for the
iLLG equation. In this work, we propose a second-order semi-implicit scheme to
solve the iLLG equation. The second temporal derivative of magnetization is
approximated by the standard centered difference scheme and the first
derivative is approximated by the midpoint scheme involving three time steps.
The nonlinear terms are treated semi-implicitly using one-sided interpolation
with the second-order accuracy. At each step, the unconditionally unique
solvability of the unsymmetric linear system of equations in the proposed
method is proved with a detailed discussion on the condition number.
Numerically, the second-order accuracy in both time and space is verified.
Using the proposed method, the inertial effect of ferromagnetics is observed in
micromagnetics simulations at small timescales, in consistency with the
hyperbolic property of the model at sub-picoseconds. For long time simulations,
the results of the iLLG model are in nice agreements with those of the LLG
model, in consistency with the parabolic feature of the iLLG model at larger
timescales.

distribution functions (PDFs), i.e., the valence quarks, the sea quarks and the
gluons, are extracted from the constituent quark model (CQM), at the hadronic
scale $Q_0^2=0.34$ $GeV^2$ to generate the constituent quark exchange model
(CQEM = QEM $\oplus$ CQM) PDFs. From the resulted PDFs, the structure functions
and the European Muon Collaboration (EMC) ratios of the above-mentioned nuclei
at the appropriate hadronic scale are calculated. To make our results more
comparable with the available experimental data, we evolve the PDFs, by using
the standard DGALP evolution equations, to the higher hard scales.
Subsequently, the EMC ratios of $^{12}C$ and $^{14}N$ nuclei at the some higher
energy scales, corresponding to the scales of available data, are calculated,
at the leading (LO) and the next-to-leading (NLO) orders of pQCD. By doing so,
it is observed that the EMC ratios do not significantly depend on the hard
scale $Q^2$, and the outcomes are consistent with the various experimental data
such as HERMES, BCDMS, JLab, SLAC, NMC, and EMC. Especially, in the mid-range
of Bjorken $x$ values, the results are so desirable. Like our previous works
for the $^4He$ and $^6Li$ nuclei, we again observe that at a fixed scale $Q^2$,
the LO and the NLO EMC ratios with high precision are approximately the same.
Therefore, one can conclude that at a given hard scale, the LO approximation is
good enough for calculating the EMC ratios of light nuclei.

symmetric teleparallel equivalent of general relativity which are both
dynamically equivalent to curvature based general relativity. By splitting the
spacetime metric and corresponding tetrad into their spatial and temporal parts
as well as through finding the Gauss-like equations, it is possible to set up a
general foundation for the different formulations of gravity. Based on these

that allows for templated declarative financial contracts and for integration
with financial stochastic models through verified compilation into so-called
payoff-expressions. Such expressions readily allow for determining the value of
a contract in a given evaluation context, such as contexts created for
stochastic simulations. The templating mechanism is useful both at the contract
specification level, for writing generic reusable contracts, and for reuse of
code that, without the templating mechanism, needs to be recompiled for
different evaluation contexts. We report on the effect of using the certified
system in the context of a GPGPU-based Monte Carlo simulation engine for
pricing various over-the-counter (OTC) financial contracts. The full
contract-management system, including the payoff-language compilation, is
verified in the Coq proof assistant and certified Haskell code is extracted
from our Coq development along with Futhark code for use in a data-parallel
pricing engine.

very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) is recognized recently as a powerful
tool for experimental testing of Einstein's General relativity. The Event
Horizon Telescope (EHT) has demonstrated that an Earth-extended VLBI with the
maximum long base ($D=10,700$ km) can provide a sufficient angular resolution
$\theta\sim 20~\mu$as at $\lambda=1.3$ mm ($\nu=230$ GHz) for imaging the
shadow around SMBH located in the galaxy M87$^\ast$. However, the accuracy of
critically important characteristics, such as the asymmetry of the
crescent-shaped bright structure around the shadow and the sharpness of a
transition zone between the shadow floor and the bright crescent silhouette,
both of order $\Delta\theta\sim 4~\mu$as, is still to be improved. In our
previous paper we have shown that Space-Earth VLBI observation within a joint
Millimetron and EHT configuration at the near-Earth high elliptical orbit (HEO)
can considerably improve the image quality. Even more solid grounds for firm
experimental validation of General relativity can be obtained with a higher
resolution available within the joint Millimetron and EHT program at the
Lagrangian point L2 in the Sun-Earth system with an expected imaging resolution
at 230~GHz of $\Delta\theta\sim 5~\mu$as. In this paper we argue that in spite
of limitations of L2 orbit, an adequate sparse $(u,v)$ coverage can be achieved
and the imaging of the shadows around Sgr A$^\ast$ and M87$^\ast$ can be
performed with a reasonable quality.

equi-dimensional space via a complex mapping which induces the robust Euler
kernel and next employs the popular $k$-means. Consequently, besides enjoying
the virtues of k-means such as simplicity and scalability to large data sets,
EulerK is also robust to noises and outliers. Although so, the centroids
captured by EulerK deviate from the unit hyper-sphere surface and thus in
strict distributional sense, actually are outliers. This weird phenomenon also
occurs in some generic kernel clustering methods. Intuitively, using such
outlier-like centroids should not be quite reasonable but it is still seldom
attended. To eliminate the deviation, we propose two Rectified Euler k-means
methods, i.e., REK1 and REK2, which retain the merits of EulerK while acquire
real centroids residing on the mapped space to better characterize the data
structures. Specifically, REK1 rectifies EulerK by imposing the constraint on
the centroids while REK2 views each centroid as the mapped image from a
pre-image in the original space and optimizes these pre-images in Euler kernel
induced space. Undoubtedly, our proposed REKs can methodologically be extended
to solve problems of such a category. Finally, the experiments validate the
effectiveness of REK1 and REK2.

considered. At each time, the decision maker can observe a subset of $K$
processes (i.e., multiple plays). The measurement drawn when observing a
process follows one of two different distributions, depending on whether the
process is normal or abnormal. The goal is to design a policy that minimizes
the Bayes risk which balances between the sample complexity, detection errors,
and the switching cost associated with switching across processes. We develop a
policy, dubbed consecutive controlled sensing (CCS), to achieve this goal. On
the one hand, by contrast to existing studies on controlled sensing, the CCS
policy senses processes consecutively to reduce the switching cost. On the
other hand, the policy controls the sensing operation in a closed-loop manner
to switch between processes when necessary to guarantee reliable inference. We
prove theoretically that CCS is asymptotically optimal in terms of minimizing
the Bayes risk as the detection error approaches zero (i.e., the sample
complexity increases). Simulation results demonstrate strong performance of CCS
in the finite regime as well.

monolingual data in languages with abundant training samples. This has left the
more common multilingual settings and lesser-spoken languages relatively
unexplored. Thus, we present a GNN that incorporates cross-lingual word
embeddings for detecting events in multilingual data streams. The first exploit
is to make the GNN work with multilingual data. For this, we outline a
construction strategy that aligns messages in different languages at both the
node and semantic levels. Relationships between messages are established by
merging entities that are the same but are referred to in different languages.
Non-English message representations are converted into English semantic space
via the cross-lingual word embeddings. The resulting message graph is then
uniformly encoded by a GNN model. In special cases where a lesser-spoken
language needs to be detected, a novel cross-lingual knowledge distillation
framework, called CLKD, exploits prior knowledge learned from similar threads
in English to make up for the paucity of annotated data. Experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show the framework to be highly effective at
detection in both multilingual data and in languages where training samples are
scarce.

we extend this theory from single-valued functions to multi-valued functions,

also give an application of this theory within the regularity theory of
stationary integral varifolds. More precisely, we prove a regularity theorem
for certain \textit{blow-up classes} of multi-valued functions, which typically
arise when studying blow-ups of sequences of stationary integral varifolds
converging to higher multiplicity planes or unions of half-planes. In such a
setting, based in part on ideas in \cite{wickstable}, \cite{minterwick}, and
\cite{beckerwick}, we are able to deduce a boundary regularity theory for
multi-valued harmonic functions; such a boundary regularity result would appear
to be the first of its kind for the multi-valued setting. In conjunction with
\cite{minter}, the results presented here establish a regularity theorem for
stable codimension one stationary integral varifolds near classical cones of
density $\frac{5}{2}$.

system. The success or failure of a software project is firmly tied to this
phase, based on communication among stakeholders using natural language. The
problem with natural language is that it can easily lead to different
understandings if it is not expressed precisely by the stakeholders involved,
which results in building a product different from the expected one. Previous
work proposed to enhance the quality of the software requirements detecting
language errors based on ISO 29148 requirements language criteria. The existing
solutions apply classical Natural Language Processing (NLP) to detect them. NLP
has some limitations, such as domain dependability which results in poor
generalization capability. Therefore, this work aims to improve the previous
work by creating a manually labeled dataset and using ensemble learning, Deep
Learning (DL), and techniques such as word embeddings and transfer learning to
overcome the generalization problem that is tied with classical NLP and improve
precision and recall metrics using a manually labeled dataset. The current
findings show that the dataset is unbalanced and which class examples should be
added more. It is tempting to train algorithms even if the dataset is not
considerably representative. Whence, the results show that models are
overfitting; in Machine Learning this issue is solved by adding more instances
to the dataset, improving label quality, removing noise, and reducing the
learning algorithms complexity, which is planned for this research.

latent positions $x^*_{i},x^*_{j}$ of the two items on the torus. The affinity
function $f$ is unknown, and it is only assumed to fulfill some shape
constraints ensuring that $f(x,y)$ is large when the distance between $x$ and
$y$ is small, and vice-versa. This non-parametric modeling offers a good
flexibility to fit data. We introduce an estimation procedure that provably
localizes all the latent positions with a maximum error of the order of
$\sqrt{\log(n)/n}$, with high-probability. This rate is proven to be minimax
optimal. A computationally efficient variant of the procedure is also analyzed
under some more restrictive assumptions. Our general results can be
instantiated to the problem of statistical seriation, leading to new bounds for
the maximum error in the ordering.

scientific question. To this end, Pearl's celebrated do-calculus provides a set
of inference rules to derive an interventional probability from an
observational one. In this framework, the primitive causal relations are
encoded as functional dependencies in a Structural Causal Model (SCM), which
are generally mapped into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) in the absence of
cycles. In this paper, by contrast, we capture causality without reference to
graphs or functional dependencies, but with information fields and
Witsenhausen's intrinsic model. The three rules of do-calculus reduce to a
unique sufficient condition for conditional independence, the topological
separation, which presents interesting theoretical and practical advantages
over the d-separation. With this unique rule, we can deal with systems that
cannot be represented with DAGs, for instance systems with cycles and/or
'spurious' edges. We treat an example that cannot be handled-to the extent of
our knowledge-with the tools of the current literature. We also explain why, in
the presence of cycles, the theory of causal inference might require different
tools, depending on whether the random variables are discrete or continuous.

of the notion of context. Among them is the Contextualized Knowledge Repository
(CKR) framework, which is rooted in description logics but links on the
reasoning side strongly to logic programs and Answer Set Programming (ASP) in
particular. The CKR framework caters for reasoning with defeasible axioms and
exceptions in contexts, which was extended to knowledge inheritance across
contexts in a coverage (specificity) hierarchy. However, the approach supports
only this single type of contextual relation and the reasoning procedures work
only for restricted hierarchies, due to non-trivial issues with model
preference under exceptions. In this paper, we overcome these limitations and
present a generalization of CKR hierarchies to multiple contextual relations,
along with their interpretation of defeasible axioms and preference. To support
reasoning, we use ASP with algebraic measures, which is a recent extension of
ASP with weighted formulas over semirings that allows one to associate
quantities with interpretations depending on the truth values of propositional
atoms. Notably, we show that for a relevant fragment of CKR hierarchies with
multiple contextual relations, query answering can be realized with the popular
asprin framework. The algebraic measures approach is more powerful and enables
e.g. reasoning with epistemic queries over CKRs, which opens interesting
perspectives for the use of quantitative ASP extensions in other applications.

analyze the polarimetric signal of the disk simultaneously with the strongly
variable stellar PSF, correct for the convolution effects to determine the
intrinsic polarization of the disk with high precision. We also extract the
disk intensity signal and derive the fractional polarization. We compare the
scattered flux from the inner and outer disk rings with the corresponding
thermal dust emissions measured in the IR and estimate the ratio between
scattered and absorbed radiation. We obtain ratios between the integrated disk
polarization flux and total system flux of 0.43% for the R' band and 0.55% for
the I' band. This indicates a reddish color for the light reflection by the
dust. The inner disk ring contributes about 75% to the total disk flux. The
obtained fractional polarization for the bright inner disk ring is 23.6% for
the I' band and similar for the R' band. The ratio between scattered disk flux
and star flux is about 2.3%. This is much smaller than the derived IR excess of
17.6% for the disk components observed in scattered light. This indicates that
only a small fraction of the radiation illuminating the disk is scattered; most
is absorbed and reemitted in the IR. We conclude that accurate, quantitative
measurements of the scattered light from circumstellar disks are possible with

computational tricks are introduced, which include the selection of the

employment of the virtual collision-dynamics simulations with monitoring atomic
distance before BOMD. These prescreening steps largely reduce the number of
trajectories in the BOMD simulations and significantly save computational cost.
The hidden Markov model combined with modified atomic connectivity matrix is
taken for the detection of reaction events in each BOMD trajectory. Starting
from several geometries close to reaction events, the further intermediate
optimization and transition-state searches are conducted. The proposed method
allows us to build the complicated multi-reaction mechanism of medium-sized

materials exhibit Rayleigh-Taylor-like instabilities that manifest themselves
in rising plumes, rising bubbles and the sinking and splitting of granular
droplets. This work explores the physics behind the splitting of a granular
droplet that is composed of smaller and denser particles in a bed of larger and
lighter particles. During its sinking motion, a granular droplet undergoes a
series of binary splits resembling the fragmentation of a liquid droplet
falling in a miscible fluid. However, different physical mechanisms cause a
granular droplet to split. By applying particle-image-velocimetry and numerical
simulations, we demonstrate that the droplet of high-density particles causes
the formation of an immobilized zone underneath the droplet. This zone
obstructs the downwards motion of the droplet and causes the droplet to spread
and ultimately to split. The resulting fragments sink at inclined trajectories
around the immobilized zone until another splitting event is initiated. The
occurrence of consecutive splitting events is explained by the re-formation of
an immobilized zone underneath the droplet fragments. Our investigations
identified three requirements for a granular droplet to split: 1) frictional
inter-particle contacts, 2) a higher density of the particles composing the
granular droplet compared to the bulk particles and 3) and a minimal granular
droplet diameter.

Un- derstanding the interdependence of plastic flow and microscopic structure
in these non-equilibrium states, however, remains a major challenge. Here, we
ex- perimentally investigate this relationship, between the relaxation dynamics
and microscopic structure of disordered colloidal solids during plastic
deformation. We apply oscillatory shear to solid colloidal monolayers and study
their particle trajectories as a function of shear rate in the plastic regime.
Under these cir- cumstances, the strain rate, the relaxation rate associated
with plastic flow, and the sample microscopic structure oscillate together but
with different phases. Interestingly, the experiments reveal that the
relaxation rate associated with plastic flow at time t is correlated with the
strain rate and sample microscopic structure measured at earlier and later
times, respectively. The relaxation rate, in this non-stationary condition,
exhibits power-law shear-thinning behavior and scales exponentially with sample
excess entropy. Thus, measurement of sample static structure (excess entropy)
provides insight about both strain-rate and constituent rearrangement dynamics
in the sample at earlier times.

Households make fertility decisions. In the model, a large exogenous positive

Ideally, we would have a concise and shared specification language. In previous
work, we have argued that communicative intents can be viewed as a
learning/assessment problem (i.e., what should the reader learn and what test
should they do well on). Learning-based specification formats are linked (e.g.,
assessments are derived from objectives) but some may more effectively specify
communicative intent. Through a large-scale experiment, we studied three
specification types: learning objectives, insights, and assessments.
Participants, guided by one of these specifications, rated their preferences
for a set of visualization designs. Then, we evaluated the set of visualization
designs to assess which specification led participants to prefer the most
effective visualizations. We find that while all specification types have
benefits over no-specification, each format has its own advantages. Our results
show that learning objective-based specifications helped participants the most

advanced secondary school levels, we present an unabridged translation of the
original German text of the famous Werner Heisenberg's breakthrough paper of
1925 into Czech language. While the paper introduces fundamentally new concepts
into mechanics, and it contains a relatively large number of equations, its
conceptual side is surprisingly lightweight when it comes to the use of
advanced mathematics. The discussions contained in its Section 1 allow students
of quantum mechanics to contemplate the reasons for the inadequacy of classical
kinematic concepts in the micro-world. Understanding of the kinematic
transition from real valued functions to complex valued ""matrices"", which is
the central point of the paper, can be reached with relatively elementary
mathematics. Translations of the Heisenberg's work into languages other than
English provide a unique opportunity to introduce the great scientific concepts
of quantum mechanics first hand to a broader audience of students who have yet
to reach proficiency in the current scientific lingua franca. The present
translation is equipped with footnotes explaining the notation, identifying
several typos and pointing out sudden changes in notation in the original
paper.

kink-antikink stripes embedded in the two-dimensional sine-Gordon equation.
Using variational techniques, we reduce the interaction dynamics between a kink
and an antikink stripe on their respective time and space dependent widths and
locations. The resulting reduced system of coupled equations is found to
accurately describe the width and undulation dynamics of a single kink stripe
as well as that of interacting ones. As an aside, we also discuss two related
topics: the computational identification of the kink center and its numerical
implications and alternative perturbative and multiple scales approaches to the
transverse direction induced dynamics for a single kink stripe in the
two-dimensional realm.

multi-agent system (e.g. a sensor network or a multi-robot team). We consider
the realistic setting where each agent acquires sensor data and is capable of
local processing before sending updates to a base station, which is in charge
of making decisions or monitoring phenomena of interest in real time. Longer
processing at an agent leads to more informative updates but also larger
delays, giving rise to a delay-accuracy-tradeoff in choosing the right amount
of local processing at each agent. We assume that the available communication
resources are limited due to interference, bandwidth, and power constraints.
Thus, a scheduling policy needs to be designed to suitably share the
communication channel among the agents. To that end, we develop a general
formulation to jointly optimize the local processing at the agents and the
scheduling of transmissions. Our novel formulation leverages the notion of Age
of Information to quantify the freshness of data and capture the delays caused
by computation and communication. We develop efficient resource allocation
algorithms using the Whittle index approach and demonstrate our proposed
algorithms in two practical applications: multi-agent occupancy grid mapping in
time-varying environments, and ride sharing in autonomous vehicle networks. Our
experiments show that the proposed co-design approach leads to a substantial
performance improvement (18-82% in our tests).

which we simulate using Monte-Carlo arithmetic in a framework called ""fuzzy
libmath"" (FL). We applied this methodology to pre-processing pipelines of the
Human Connectome Project, a flagship open-data project in neuroimaging. We
found that FL-perturbed pipelines accurately reproduce the variability induced
by OS updates and that this similarity is only mildly dependent on simulation
parameters. Importantly, we also found between-subject differences were
preserved in both cases, though the between-run variability was of comparable
magnitude for both FL and OS perturbations. We found the numerical precision in
the HCP pre-processed images to be relatively low, with less than 8 significant
bits among the 24 available, which motivates further investigation of the
numerical stability of components in the tested pipeline. Overall, our results
establish that FL accurately simulates results variability due to OS updates,
and is a practical framework to quantify numerical uncertainty in neuroimaging.

the virus. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) imaging has been proposed as a
screening tool as it is a much cheaper and easier to apply imaging modality

chest x-ray and computed tomography. Given the scarcity of expert radiologists
for interpreting POCUS examinations in many highly affected regions around the
world, low-cost deep learning-driven clinical decision support solutions can
have a large impact during the on-going pandemic. Motivated by this, we
introduce COVID-Net US, a highly efficient, self-attention deep convolutional
neural network design tailored for COVID-19 screening from lung POCUS images.
Experimental results show that the proposed COVID-Net US can achieve an AUC of
over 0.98 while achieving 353X lower architectural complexity, 62X lower
computational complexity, and 14.3X faster inference times on a Raspberry Pi.
Clinical validation was also conducted, where select cases were reviewed and
reported on by a practicing clinician (20 years of clinical practice)

interpretation. To advocate affordable healthcare and artificial intelligence
for resource-constrained environments, we have made COVID-Net US open source

unsupervised domain adaptation. Segmenting either type of lung condition at
inference may support a range of clinical applications during evolving epidemic
stages, but also demonstrates value in resource-constrained clinical scenarios.
Adapting real clinical data acquired from COVID-19 patients to those from CAP
patients significantly improved Dice scores from 0.60 to 0.87 (p < 0.001) and
from 0.43 to 0.71 (p < 0.001), on independent COVID-19 and CAP test cases,

with only a small amount of data in both training and adaptation data sets, a
common constraint for deploying machine learning models in clinical practice.
Interestingly, we also report that the inverse adaptation, from labelled CAP
data to unlabeled COVID-19 data, did not demonstrate an improvement when tested
on either condition. Furthermore, we offer a possible explanation that
correlates the segmentation performance to label consistency and data domain
diversity in this point-of-care lung ultrasound application.

Nevertheless, it cannot perform face verification tasks properly because face

the same time and decide whether the two faces identify the same person. The
structure of Extreme Leaning Machine was not designed to feed two input data
streams simultaneously, thus, in 2-input scenarios Extreme Learning Machine
methods are normally applied using concatenated inputs. However, this setup
consumes two times more computational resources and it is not optimized for
recognition tasks where learning a separable distance metric is critical. For
these reasons, we propose and develop a Siamese Extreme Learning Machine

simultaneously. It utilizes a dual-stream Siamese condition in the extra
Siamese layer to transform the data before passing it along to the hidden
layer. Moreover, we propose a Gender-Ethnicity-Dependent triplet feature
exclusively trained on a variety of specific demographic groups. This feature
enables learning and extracting of useful facial features of each group.
Experiments were conducted to evaluate and compare the performances of SELM,

organization of interlocked ions and water, progressively confined in
nano-slits between charged surfaces of Calcium-Silicate-Hydrates. Due to the

for robots that are going to be deployed in safety-critical tasks. If we do not
have a model of the dynamics of the world, which is often the case in complex
domains, we may need to approximate a performance function of the robot based
on its interaction with the environment. Such a performance function gives us
insights into the behaviour of the robot, allowing us to fine-tune the
controller with manual interventions. In high-dimensionality systems, where the
actionstate space is large, fine-tuning a controller is non-trivial. To
overcome this problem, we propose a performance function whose domain is
defined by external features and parameters of the controller. Attainment
regions are defined over such a domain defined by feature-parameter pairs, and
serve the purpose of enabling prediction of successful execution of the task.
The use of the feature-parameter space -in contrast to the action-state space-
allows us to adapt, explain and finetune the controller over a simpler (i.e.,
lower dimensional space). When the robot successfully executes the task, we use
the attainment regions to gain insights into the limits of the controller, and
its robustness. When the robot fails to execute the task, we use the regions to
debug the controller and find adaptive and counterfactual changes to the
solutions. Another advantage of this approach is that we can generalise through
the use of Gaussian processes regression of the performance function in the
high-dimensional space. To test our approach, we demonstrate learning an
approximation to the performance function in simulation, with a mobile robot
traversing different terrain conditions. Then, with a sample-efficient method,
we propagate the attainment regions to a physical robot in a similar
environment.

model trained on labeled source data to perform well on unlabeled or weakly
labeled target data from a different domain. Most common DA techniques require
concurrent access to the input images of both the source and target domains.
However, in practice, privacy concerns often impede the availability of source
images in the adaptation phase. This is a very frequent DA scenario in medical
imaging, where, for instance, the source and target images could come from
different clinical sites. We introduce a source-free domain adaptation for
image segmentation. Our formulation is based on minimizing a label-free entropy
loss defined over target-domain data, which we further guide with a
domain-invariant prior on the segmentation regions. Many priors can be derived
from anatomical information. Here, a class ratio prior is estimated from
anatomical knowledge and integrated in the form of a Kullback Leibler (KL)
divergence in our overall loss function. Furthermore, we motivate our overall
loss with an interesting link to maximizing the mutual information between the
target images and their label predictions. We show the effectiveness of our
prior aware entropy minimization in a variety of domain-adaptation scenarios,
with different modalities and applications, including spine, prostate, and
cardiac segmentation. Our method yields comparable results to several state of
the art adaptation techniques, despite having access to much less information,
as the source images are entirely absent in our adaptation phase. Our
straightforward adaptation strategy uses only one network, contrary to popular
adversarial techniques, which are not applicable to a source-free DA setting.

symmetric harmonic trap is modelled by the time dependent Gross-Pitaevskii
equation. When the angular momentum carried by the condensate does not vanish,
the minimum energy state describes vortices (or antivortices) that propagate
around the trap center. The number of (anti)vortices increases with the angular
momentum, and they repel each other to form Abrikosov lattices. Besides
vortices and antivortices there are also stagnation points where the superflow
vanishes; to our knowledge the stagnation points have not been analyzed
previously, in the context of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The Poincar\'e
index formula states that the difference in the number of vortices and
stagnation points can never change. When the number of stagnation points is
small, they tend to aggregate into degenerate propagating structures. But when
the number becomes sufficiently large, the stagnation points tend to pair up
with the vortex cores, to propagate around the trap center in regular lattice
arrangements. There is an analogy with the geometry of the Kosterlitz-Thouless

between 2017 July and 2020 August. Over this period, the power density spectrum
showed a stable morphology, with broad $\sim25\%$ rms band-limited noise below
16 Hz. Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) were occasionally observed, with the
most notably detections including a low-frequency QPO centered at 2.7 Hz and a
sharp QPO centered at 115 Hz that may be a 2:3 resonance with the spin
frequency. Further, the energy dependence of the band-limited noise is studied
through a spectroscopic analysis of the complex covariance in two frequency
intervals. It is found that the power law continuum is the primary driver for
the observed variability, although the thermal (blackbody) emission also
appears to be intrinsically variable in area ($5\%$ rms) and temperature ($1\%$
rms). Notably, the 1 keV emission feature seen in all X-ray spectra of IGR
J17062-6143 varies with the same amplitude as the power law, but systematically
lags behind that continuum emission. These results appear consistent with a
scenario in which a time variable Compton-scattering corona is the primary
source for the observed stochastic variability, with the variability observed
in the emission feature and at the lowest photon energies being due to the disk
reflection of the power law continuum.

show that the dominant effect of the core is to stabilize the envelope to
radial perturbations, in some cases completely (i.e. for all $\gamma > 1$).
When instability is possible, unstable planetary configurations occupy a strip
of $\gamma$ values whose upper boundary falls below $\gamma=4/3$. Fiducial
evolutionary tracks of giant planets forming through core accretion appear
unlikely to cross the dynamical instability strip that we define.

clouds. A variety of materials likely condense, including refractory metal
oxides and silicates; the precise compositions and crystal structures of
predicted cloud particles depend on the modeling framework used and have not
yet been empirically constrained. Spitzer has shown tentative evidence of the
silicate feature in L dwarf spectra and JWST can measure these features in many
L dwarfs. Here, we present new models to predict the signatures of the
strongest cloud absorption features. We investigate different cloud mineral
species and determine how particle size, mineralogy, and crystalline structure
change spectral features. We find that silicate and refractory clouds have a
strong cloud absorption feature for small particle sizes ($\leq$ 1 $\mu$m).
Model spectra are compared to five brown dwarfs that show evidence of the
silicate feature; models that include small particles in the upper layers of
the atmosphere produce a broad cloud mineral feature, and that better match the
observed spectra than the Ackerman & Marley (2001) cloud model. We simulate
observations with the MIRI instrument on JWST for a range of nearby, cloudy
brown dwarfs, demonstrating that these features could be readily detectable if
small particles are present. Furthermore, for photometrically variable brown
dwarfs, our predictions suggest that with JWST, by measuring spectroscopic
variability inside and outside a mineral feature, we can establish silicate (or
other) clouds as the cause of variability. Mid-infrared spectroscopy is a
promising tool to empirically constrain the complex cloud condensation sequence

weak source separation, limited range in the presence of acoustic insulation,

RadioMic, a radio-based sound sensing system to mitigate these issues and
enrich sound applications. RadioMic constructs sound based on tiny vibrations
on active sources (e.g., a speaker or human throat) or object surfaces (e.g.,
paper bag), and can work through walls, even a soundproof one. To convert the
extremely weak sound vibration in the radio signals into sound signals,
RadioMic introduces radio acoustics, and presents training-free approaches for
robust sound detection and high-fidelity sound recovery. It then exploits a
neural network to further enhance the recovered sound by expanding the
recoverable frequencies and reducing the noises. RadioMic translates massive
online audios to synthesized data to train the network, and thus minimizes the
need of RF data. We thoroughly evaluate RadioMic under different scenarios

hardness can have surprising implications to many fields in computer science.
  We first define and investigate the basic complexity-theoretic properties of
minimum quantum circuit size problems for three natural objects: Boolean
functions, unitaries, and quantum states. We show that these problems are not
trivially in NP but in QCMA (or have QCMA protocols). Next, we explore the
relations between the three quantum MCSPs and their variants. We discover that
some reductions that are not known for classical MCSP exist for quantum MCSPs
for unitaries and states, e.g., search-to-decision reduction and
self-reduction. Finally, we systematically generalize results known for
classical MCSP to the quantum setting (including quantum cryptography, quantum
learning theory, quantum circuit lower bounds, and quantum fine-grained
complexity) and also find new connections to tomography and quantum gravity.
Due to the fundamental differences between classical and quantum circuits, most
of our results require extra care and reveal properties and phenomena unique to
the quantum setting. Our findings could be of interest for future studies, and
we post several open problems for further exploration along this direction.

study how dressing of an impurity leads to a modification of its chemical
reactivity. Using a Gaussian state variational method in the frame of the

understanding of Efimov physics has been developed in the few-body context.
However, it has proven to be challenging to describe the role Efimov-type
correlations play in many-body systems such as quenched or collapsing
Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). To study the impact the Efimov effect can
have in such scenarios, we consider a light impurity immersed in a weakly
interacting BEC, forming a Bose polaron. In this case, the higher-order
correlations are localized around the impurity, making it more feasible to
develop a theoretical description. Specifically, we employ a Gaussian state
variational Ansatz in the reference frame of the impurity, capable of both
capturing the Efimov effect and the formation of the polaron cloud. We find
that the Efimov effect leads to a cooperative binding of bosons to the impurity
and the formation of a many-body bound state. As a result, the polaron is not
the ground state, but rendered a metastable excited state which can decay into
these Efimov clusters. While this decay is slow for small interaction
strengths, it becomes more prominent as the attractive scattering length
increases, up to the point where the polaron becomes completely unstable. This
critical scattering length can be interpreted as a many-body shifted Efimov
resonance, where the scattering of two excitations of the bath with the polaron
can lead to bound state formation. Compared to the few-body case, the resonance
is shifted to smaller attractive scattering lengths due to the participation of
the polaron cloud in the cooperative binding process. This corresponds to an
intriguing scenario of polaron-assisted chemistry, where many-body effects lead
to enhanced signal of the chemical recombination process, which can be directly
probed in state-of-the-art experiments.

delivery urgency and the knowledge of current contention intensity. For an
idealized environment where the contention intensity is completely known, we
develop an analytical framework based on the theory of Markov Decision Process
(MDP), which leads to an optimal scheme by applying backward induction. For a
realistic environment where the contention intensity is incompletely known, we
develop a framework using Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP),
which can in theory be solved. We show that for both environments, there exists
an optimal scheme that is optimal over all types of policies. To overcome the
infeasibility in obtaining an optimal or near-optimal scheme from the POMDP
framework, we investigate the behaviors of the optimal scheme for two extreme
cases in the MDP framework, and leverage intuition gained from these behaviors
to propose a heuristic scheme for the realistic environment with TDR close to
the maximum achievable TDR in the idealized environment. In addition, we
propose an approximation on the knowledge of contention intensity to further
simplify this heuristic scheme. Numerical results with respect to a wide range

of the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper (AAH) Hamiltonian can also be identified as a
topological phase transition. Interestingly, the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry also
breaks down at the same critical point. However, in this article, we have shown
that the delocalization-localization transition and the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry
breaking are not connected to a topological phase transition. To demonstrate
this, we have studied the non-Hermitian $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric AAH
Hamiltonian in the presence of Rashba Spin-Orbit (RSO) coupling. We have
obtained an analytical expression of the topological transition point and
compared it with the numerically obtained critical points. We have found that,

descriptive models of segregation that are able to predict neighborhood scale
racial sorting dynamics. While coarse regional population projections are
widely accessible, small area population changes remain challenging to predict
because granular data on migration is limited and mobility behaviors are driven
by complex social and idiosyncratic dynamics. Consequently, to account for such
drivers, it is necessary to develop methods that can extract effective
descriptions of their impacts on population dynamics based solely on
statistical analysis of available data. Here, we develop and validate a
Density-Functional Fluctuation Theory (DFFT) that quantifies segregation using
density-dependent functions extracted from population counts and uses these
functions to accurately forecast how the racial/ethnic compositions of
neighborhoods across the US are likely to change. Importantly, DFFT makes
minimal assumptions about the nature of the underlying causes of segregation
and is designed to quantify segregation for neighborhoods with different total
populations in regions with different compositions. This quantification can be
used to accurately forecast both average changes in neighborhood compositions
and the likelihood of more drastic changes such as those associated with
gentrification and neighborhood tipping. As such, DFFT provides a powerful
framework for researchers and policy makers alike to better quantify and

Bayesian methods may be particularly promising for overcoming these challenges,
as they are naturally less sensitive to the negative effects of sparse and

order to: 1) Recover the full system states from measurement data (e.g.
temperature, velocity field, etc.). We use Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo to sample
the posterior distribution of a deep and dense BNN, and show that it is
possible to accurately capture physics of varying complexity, without
overfitting. 2) Recover the parameters instantiating the underlying partial
differential equation (PDE) governing the physical system. Using the trained
BNN, as a surrogate of the system response, we generate datasets of derivatives
that are potentially comprising the latent PDE governing the observed system
and then perform a sequential threshold Bayesian linear regression (STBLR),
between the successive derivatives in space and time, to recover the original
PDE parameters. We take advantage of the confidence intervals within the BNN
outputs, and introduce the spatial derivatives cumulative variance into the
STBLR likelihood, to mitigate the influence of highly uncertain derivative data
points; thus allowing for more accurate parameter discovery. We demonstrate our
approach on a handful of example, in applied physics and non-linear dynamics.

characterisation of free will. A new formulation of this property is proposed
in which it is seen as a three-stage decision-making process implemented by an
individual to escape his or her own real or supposed alienation. This
decision-making process is represented in the form of a computer model called

defining a provable disclosure risk in the presence of arbitrary adversaries;
it guarantees that whether an individual is in a database or not, the results
of a DP procedure should be similar in terms of their probability distribution.
While DP mechanisms are provably effective in protecting privacy, they often
negatively impact the utility of the query responses, statistics and/or
analyses that come as outputs from these mechanisms. To address this problem,
we use ideas from the area of robust statistics which aims at reducing the
influence of outlying observations on statistical inference. Based on the
preliminary known links between differential privacy and robust statistics, we
modify the objective perturbation mechanism by making use of a new bounded
function and define a bounded M-Estimator with adequate statistical properties.
The resulting privacy mechanism, named ""Perturbed M-Estimation"", shows
important potential in terms of improved statistical utility of its outputs as
suggested by some preliminary results. These results consequently support the
need to further investigate the use of robust statistical tools for
differential privacy.

unit and a compact electro-tactile based display that can deliver text-related
electrical signals to the fingertip skin through a wearable and Braille-dot
patterned electrode array and thus delivers the electro-stimulation based
Braille touch sensations to the fingertip. To achieve the goal of aiding BVI to
read any text not written in Braille through this portable system, in this
work, a Rapid Optical Character Recognition (R-OCR) method is firstly developed
for real-time processing text information based on a Fisheye imaging device
mounted at the finger-wearable electro-tactile display. This allows real-time
translation of printed text to electro-Braille along with natural movement of
user's fingertip as if reading any Braille display or book. More importantly,
an electro-tactile neuro-stimulation feedback mechanism is proposed and
incorporated with the R-OCR method, which facilitates a new opto-electrotactile
feedback based text line tracking control approach that enables text line
following by user fingertip during reading. Multiple experiments were designed
and conducted to test the ability of blindfolded participants to read through

experiments show that as the result of the opto-electrotactile-feedback, the
users were able to maintain their fingertip within a $2mm$ distance of the text
