(-\Delta)^{2}u+V(x)u=f(u)\ \text{in}\ \mathbb{R}^{4}, \end{equation} when the
nonlinearity has the special form $f(t)=t(\exp(t^2)-1)$ and $V(x)\geq c>0$ is a
constant or the Rabinowitz potential. One of the crucial elements used in [9]
is the Fourier rearrangement argument. However, this argument is not applicable
if $f(t)$ is not an odd function. Thus, it still remains open whether the above
equation with the general critical exponential nonlinearity $f(u)$ admits a
ground-state solution even when $V(x)$ is a positive constant.
  The first purpose of this paper is to develop a Fourier rearrangement-free
approach to solve the above problem. More precisely, we will prove that there
is a threshold $\gamma^{*}$ such that for any $\gamma\in (0,\gamma^*)$, the
above equation with the constant potential $V(x)=\gamma>0$ admits a
ground-state solution, while does not admit any ground-state solution for any
$\gamma\in (\gamma^{*},+\infty)$. The second purpose of this paper is to
establish the existence of a ground-state solution to the above equation with
any degenerate Rabinowitz potential $V$ vanishing on some bounded open set.
Among other techniques, the proof also relies on a critical Adams inequality
involving the degenerate potential which is of its own interest.

often been overshadowed by the controversies that erupted in England and France
after the discovery. However, their role was crucial, not only in bringing
about the discovery in the first place, but also in resolving some of the
post-discovery controversies that erupted around priority for the prediction
and naming of the planet. German astronomers in Central and Eastern Europe
possessed some of the best telescopes of the day and had established themselves
over several decades as being at the forefront of observational astronomy. They
had produced the star charts that in the end proved indispensable for allowing
identification of the planet, while a German publication, Astronomische
Nachrichten, published by H. C. Schumacher in Altona, in the vicinity of
Hamburg, then part of the Kingdom of Denmark, served as the journal of record.
The general neglect of the German part of the story is most strongly attested
by the inaccuracies concerning what actually happened on discovery night, which
were long propagated in the English-speaking literature. Notably, for 30 years
after the discovery, it was not appreciated that there were two observers,
while the role of the sky map used was often exaggerated. This chapter sets
forth a more complete picture, and in particular emphasises more than previous
accounts the critical role of d'Arrest, arguing that he should be celebrated as
a co-discoverer. In addition, evidence presented here, much of it not
previously available in the English-speaking literature, shows that the name
""Neptune"" was eventually accepted throughout the scientific community based on

utilize a Transformer-based Pointer Generator Network to generate abstract
summaries for meeting transcripts. This model uses 2 LSTMs as an encoder and a
decoder, a Pointer network which copies words from the inputted text, and a
Generator network to produce out-of-vocabulary words (hence making the summary
abstractive). Moreover, a coverage mechanism is used to avoid repetition of
words in the generated summary. First, we show that training the model on a
news summary dataset and using zero-shot learning to test it on the meeting
dataset proves to produce better results than training it on the AMI meeting
dataset. Second, we show that training this model first on out-of-domain data,
such as the CNN-Dailymail dataset, followed by a fine-tuning stage on the AMI
meeting dataset is able to improve the performance of the model significantly.
We test our model on a testing set from the AMI dataset and report the ROUGE-2
score of the generated summary to compare with previous literature. We also
report the Factual score of our summaries since it is a better benchmark for
abstractive summaries since the ROUGE-2 score is limited to measuring
word-overlaps. We show that our improved model is able to improve on previous
models by at least 5 ROUGE-2 scores, which is a substantial improvement. Also,
a qualitative analysis of the summaries generated by our model shows that these
summaries and human-readable and indeed capture most of the important
information from the transcripts.

Unfortunately, standard approximate query processing techniques to accelerate
such queries are not applicable because they assume the result of the
predicates are available ahead of time. Furthermore, recent work using cheap
approximations (i.e., proxies) do not support aggregation queries with
predicates.
  To accelerate aggregation queries with expensive predicates, we develop and
analyze a query processing algorithm that leverages proxies (ABae). ABae must
account for the key challenge that it may sample records that do not satisfy
the predicate. To address this challenge, we first use the proxy to group
records into strata so that records satisfying the predicate are ideally
grouped into few strata. Given these strata, ABae uses pilot sampling and
plugin estimates to sample according to the optimal allocation. We show that
ABae converges at an optimal rate in a novel analysis of stratified sampling
with draws that may not satisfy the predicate. We further show that ABae
outperforms on baselines on six real-world datasets, reducing labeling costs by

requires accessing large amounts of data, which can easily exceed the capacity

implicitly assuming that data is available locally or via low latency
network-based data storage. Such implicit assumptions often do not hold in a
cloud-based training environment, where deep learning practitioners create and
tear down dedicated GPU clusters on demand, or do not have the luxury of local
storage, such as in serverless workloads. In this work, we investigate the
performance of distributed training that leverages training data residing
entirely inside cloud storage buckets. These buckets promise low storage costs,
but come with inherent bandwidth limitations that make them seem unsuitable for
an efficient training solution. To account for these bandwidth limitations, we
propose the use of two classical techniques, namely caching and pre-fetching,
to mitigate the training performance degradation. We implement a prototype,
DELI, based on the popular deep learning framework PyTorch by building on its
data loading abstractions. We then evaluate the training performance of two
deep learning workloads using Google Cloud's NVIDIA K80 GPU servers and show
that we can reduce the time that the training loop is waiting for data by
85.6%-93.5% compared to loading directly from a storage bucket - thus achieving
comparable performance to loading data directly from disk - while only storing
a fraction of the data locally at a time. In addition, DELI has the potential
of lowering the cost of running a training workload, especially on models with
long per-epoch training times.

heights of the highest peaks in the likelihood. In the simplest form of
self-calibration, the look-elsewhere-corrected $\chi^2$ of a physical peak is
approximated by the $\chi^2$ of the peak minus the $\chi^2$ of the highest

a fast method to quantify the statistical significance with improved accuracy.

  Zhang","Dual Path Learning for Domain Adaptation of Semantic Segmentation","Accepted by ICCV 2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Domain adaptation for semantic segmentation enables to alleviate the need for
large-scale pixel-wise annotations. Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL)
with a combination of image-to-image translation shows great effectiveness in
adaptive segmentation. The most common practice is to perform SSL along with
image translation to well align a single domain (the source or target).
However, in this single-domain paradigm, unavoidable visual inconsistency
raised by image translation may affect subsequent learning. In this paper,
based on the observation that domain adaptation frameworks performed in the
source and target domain are almost complementary in terms of image translation
and SSL, we propose a novel dual path learning (DPL) framework to alleviate
visual inconsistency. Concretely, DPL contains two complementary and
interactive single-domain adaptation pipelines aligned in source and target
domain respectively. The inference of DPL is extremely simple, only one
segmentation model in the target domain is employed. Novel technologies such as
dual path image translation and dual path adaptive segmentation are proposed to
make two paths promote each other in an interactive manner. Experiments on
GTA5$\rightarrow$Cityscapes and SYNTHIA$\rightarrow$Cityscapes scenarios
demonstrate the superiority of our DPL model over the state-of-the-art methods.

closely with human hosts, and get involved in modulating drug efficacy and drug
toxicity. Microbes have become novel targets for the development of
antibacterial agents. Therefore, screening of microbe-drug associations can
benefit greatly drug research and development. With the increase of microbial
genomic and pharmacological datasets, we are greatly motivated to develop an
effective computational method to identify new microbe-drug associations. In
this paper, we proposed a novel method, Graph2MDA, to predict microbe-drug
associations by using variational graph autoencoder (VGAE). We constructed
multi-modal attributed graphs based on multiple features of microbes and drugs,
such as molecular structures, microbe genetic sequences, and function
annotations. Taking as input the multi-modal attribute graphs, VGAE was trained
to learn the informative and interpretable latent representations of each node
and the whole graph, and then a deep neural network classifier was used to
predict microbe-drug associations. The hyperparameter analysis and model
ablation studies showed the sensitivity and robustness of our model. We
evaluated our method on three independent datasets and the experimental results
showed that our proposed method outperformed six existing state-of-the-art
methods. We also explored the meaningness of the learned latent representations
of drugs and found that the drugs show obvious clustering patterns that are
significantly consistent with drug ATC classification. Moreover, we conducted
case studies on two microbes and two drugs and found 75\%-95\% predicted
associations have been reported in PubMed literature. Our extensive performance
evaluations validated the effectiveness of our proposed method.\

relation between the observed features and the underlying morphology of the

We model the polarised synchrotron emission on the basis of diffusive shock
acceleration of cosmic-ray electrons. We find that the synchrotron emission
produced in a shocked turbulent medium can reproduce some of the observed
features in radio relics. Shock compression can give rise to a high
polarisation fraction at the shock front and a partial alignment of the
polarisation $E$-vectors with the shock normal. Our work confirms that radio

Rossby wave instability, in protoplanetary disks. However, large-scale
asymmetries indicative of dust-trapping vortices are uncommon in sub-millimeter
continuum observations. One possible explanation is that vortices have short
lifetimes. In this paper, we explore how radiative cooling can lead to vortex
decay. Elliptical vortices in Keplerian disks go through adiabatic heating and
cooling cycles. Radiative cooling modifies these cycles and generates
baroclinicity that changes the potential vorticity of the vortex. We show that
the net effect is typically a spin down, or decay, of the vortex for a
sub-adiabatic radial stratification. We perform a series of two-dimensional
shearing box simulations, varying the gas cooling (or relaxation) time, $t_{\rm
cool}$, and initial vortex strength. We measure the vortex decay half-life,
$t_{\rm half}$, and find that it can be roughly predicted by the timescale
ratio $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm turn}$, where $t_{\rm turn}$ is the vortex
turnaround time. Decay is slow in both the isothermal ($t_{\rm cool}\ll t_{\rm
turn}$) and adiabatic ($t_{\rm cool}\gg t_{\rm turn}$) limits; it is fastest
when $t_{\rm cool}\sim0.1\,t_{\rm turn}$, where $t_{\rm half}$ is as short as
$\sim300$ orbits. At tens of au where disk rings are typically found, $t_{\rm
turn}$ is likely much longer than $t_{\rm cool}$, potentially placing vortices
in the fast decay regime.

spontaneously broken and where two out of three Dirac cones acquire a mass gap.
The associated quantum critical point can be understood in terms of a

an insulating phase in which the SO(3) symmetry is restored and the U(1)

assume direct measurement of the sensor and omit the radiation quanta emitted

propose a protocol for criticality-enhanced sensing via continuous observation
of the emitted radiation quanta. Under general assumptions, we establish a
scaling theory for the global quantum Fisher information of the joint system
and environment state at dissipative critical points. We derive universal
scaling laws featuring transient and long-time behavior governed by the
underlying critical exponents. Importantly, such scaling laws exceed the
standard quantum limit and can in principle saturate the Heisenberg limit. To
harness such advantageous scaling, we propose a practical sensing scheme based
on continuous detection of the emitted quanta as realized experimentally in
various quantum-optical setups. In such a scheme a single interrogation
corresponds to a (stochastic) quantum trajectory of the open system evolving
under the nonunitary dynamics dependent on the parameter to be sensed and the
backaction of the continuous measurement. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the
associated precision scaling significantly exceeds that based on direct
measurement of the critical steady state, thereby establishing the metrological
value of the continuous detection of the emitted quanta at dissipative
criticality. We illustrate our protocol via counting the photons emitted by the
open Rabi model, a paradigmatic model for the study of dissipative phase
transition with finite components. Our protocol is applicable to generic
quantum-optical open sensors permitting continuous readout, and may find
applications at the frontier of quantum sensing, such as the human-machine
interface, magnetic diagnosis of heart disease, and zero-field nuclear magnetic
resonance.

classical MC neutrino transport solver; in essence, a flavor degree of freedom
including mixing state is added into each MC particle. This extension requires
updating numerical treatments of collision terms, in particular for scattering
processes. We deal with the technical problem by generating a new MC particle
at each scattering event. To reduce statistical noise inherent in MC methods,
we develop the effective mean free path method. This suppresses a sudden change
of flavor state due to collisions without increasing the number of MC
particles. We present a suite of code tests to validate these new modules with
comparing to the results reported in previous studies. Our QKE-MC solver is

choices are based on various costs related to social ostracism, social norms,
environmental concern and financial burden. The coupled model exhibits bistable
dynamics, with one stable state corresponding to high mitigation efforts and
low CB abundance, and the other to low mitigation efforts and high CB
abundance. Furthermore, we consider social interactions among a network of

remarkably sensitive to periodic disturbances in the planet's gravitational
field. We identify 15 additional density and bending waves in Saturn's C ring
driven by the planet's internal normal mode oscillations. Taking advantage of a
highly accurate absolute radius scale for the rings, we are able to detect
weak, high-wavenumber (up to m=14) waves with km-scale radial wavelengths. From
a systematic scan of the entire C ring, we report the discovery and
identification of 11 new Outer Lindblad Resonances (OLRs), two counterpart
inner Lindblad resonances (ILRs), and two new Outer Vertical Resonances (OVRs).
The close agreement of the observed resonance locations and wave rotation rates
with the predictions of models of Saturn's interior suggests that all of the
new waves are driven by Saturnian f-mode oscillations. As classified by their
spherical harmonic shapes, the modes in question range in azimuthal wavenumber
from m=8 to 14, with associated resonance orders l-m ranging from 0 to 8, where
l is the overall angular wavenumber of the mode. Our suite of detections for
l-m=4 is now complete from m=8 to m=14. Curiously, detections with l-m=2 are
less common. These newly-identified non-sectoral waves sample latitudinal as
well as radial structure within the planet and may thus provide valuable
constraints on Saturn's differential rotation. Allowing for the fact that the
two ILR-type waves appear to be due to the same normal modes as two of the
OLR-type waves, the 13 additional modes identified here bring to 34 the number
of distinct f-modes suitable for constraining interior models.

hole (BH) across magnetic field creates classical non-zero second Poincare
invariant, the electromagnetic anomaly (Lyutikov 2011). In the case of
magnetized plasma supporting Alfven wave, it is the fluctuating component of
the magnetic field that contributes to the anomaly: for sufficiency small BH
moving with the super-Alfvenic velocity the plasma does not have enough time to
screen the parallel electric field. This creates time-dependent $ {\bf E} \cdot

interpreted as a cyclotron absorption line. Timing analysis of the NuSTAR data
revealed only slight variations of a single-peaked pulse profile of the source

review process, where some papers are assigned reviewers who provide reviews
under an experimental condition. In this paper, we consider the question: how
should reviewers be divided between phases or conditions in order to maximize
total assignment similarity? We make several contributions towards answering
this question. First, we prove that when the set of papers requiring additional
review is unknown, a simplified variant of this problem is NP-hard. Second, we
empirically show that across several datasets pertaining to real conference
data, dividing reviewers between phases/conditions uniformly at random allows
an assignment that is nearly as good as the oracle optimal assignment. This
uniformly random choice is practical for both the two-phase and conference
experiment design settings. Third, we provide explanations of this phenomenon
by providing theoretical bounds on the suboptimality of this random strategy
under certain natural conditions. From these easily-interpretable conditions,
we provide actionable insights to conference program chairs about whether a
random reviewer split is suitable for their conference.

  beyond rotating wave approximation: Intermixed intensity-dependent coupling","15 pages, 3 figures, submitted",,,,"quant-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recalling that the rotating wave approximation (RWA) is only valid in the
weak coupling regimes, the purpose of this paper is to study the Hamiltonian
dynamics describing the full quantum mechanical approach of the interaction
between various configurations of three-level atoms Lambda, V and ladder
distinctly with a two-mode radiation field, while the RWA is not considered;
the counter-rotating terms (CRTs) are taken into account. Generally, the
presence of CRTs in the Hamiltonian prevents one to achieve an analytical
solution. Moreover, as we will show in the present work, using the perturbation
theory, analytical solvable Hamiltonians can be successfully obtained.
According to our calculations, the contribution of CRTs within the ordinary
Hamiltonian is equivalent to the replacement of the constant detuning with a
specific intensity dependent detuning in the first order, and the constant atom
field coupling with a particular intensity dependent (f deformed) coupling in
the second order of the associated perturbation parameter. Moreover, noticing
that according to the initial expression of the Hamiltonian, each mode of the
field interacts only with a specific pair of the allowed transitions of each
type of the three-level atom, it is surprisingly observed that via applying the
mentioned approach, the obtained intensity dependent coupling functions depend
on both modes of the field, f(na,nb). In this way, it is seen that the CRTs are
removed with the price of arriving at some intermixed intensity dependent atom
field coupling functions of the two modes of the field. In this way, the
obtained final Hamiltonians are analytically solvable. At last, by determining
the time evolution of the atom field wave function, we study the effects of
CRTs on a few nonclassical properties of the state of the system, including the
atomic population inversion and photon statistics.

presenting the first measurement of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) at high
redshift in overdense environments via grism spectroscopy. From the completed
MAMMOTH-Grism observations in the field of the BOSS1244 protocluster at
$z=2.24\pm0.02$, We secure a sample of 36 protocluster member galaxies at
$z\sim2.24$, showing strong nebular emission lines ([O III], H$\beta$ and [O
II]) in their G141 spectra. Using the multi-wavelength broad-band deep imaging
from HST and ground-based telescopes, we measure their stellar masses in the
range of $[10^{9},10^{10.4}]M_\odot$, instantaneous star formation rates (SFR)
from 10 to 240$M_\odot yr^{-1}$, and global gas-phase metallicities
[$\frac{1}{3}$,1] of solar. Compared with similarly selected field galaxy
sample at the same redshift, our galaxies show on average increased SFRs by
$\sim$0.06dex and $\sim$0.18dex at $\sim$10$^{10.1}M_\odot$ and
$\sim$10$^{9.8}M_\odot$, respectively. Using the stacked spectra of our sample
galaxies, we derive the MZR in the BOSS1244 protocluster core as $12+\log({\rm
O/H})=(0.136\pm0.018)\times\log(M_\ast/M_\odot)+(7.082\pm0.175)$, showing
significantly shallower slope than that in the field. This shallow MZR slope is
likely caused by the combined effects of efficient recycling of feedback-driven
winds and cold-mode gas accretion in protocluster environments. The former
effect helps low-mass galaxies residing in overdensities retain their metal
production, whereas the latter effect dilutes the metal content of high-mass
galaxies, making them more metal poor than their coeval field counterparts.

inequalities in graphs of $\mathcal{U}$ form a convex cone. We compute this
cone for several families of graphs including complete graphs, even cycles,
stars and paths; the latter is the most interesting and intricate case that we

phenomenon: the cone of valid pure binomial inequalities is actually rational
polyhedral, and therefore all valid pure binomial inequalities can be generated
from the finite collection of exponent vectors of the extreme rays. Using the
work of Kopparty and Rossman, we show that the cone of valid inequalities is
indeed rational polyhedral when all graphs $H_i$ are series-parallel and
chordal, and we conjecture that polyhedrality holds for any finite collection

First, we formalize the task of unsupervised domain adaptation for panoramic

source domain of pinhole camera data is deployed in a different target domain
of panoramic images, for which no labels are available. To validate this idea,
we collect and publicly release DensePASS - a novel densely annotated dataset

progress of attention-based mechanisms and build a generic framework for
cross-domain panoramic semantic segmentation based on different variants of

construction of local molecular orbitals (LMOs) in systems described using
non-orthogonal atomic orbital (AO) basis sets. In particular, we introduce
three different variants of SCDM (referred to as SCDM-M, SCDM-L, and SCDM-G)
that can be used in conjunction with the standard AO basis sets. The SCDM-M and
SCDM-L variants are based on the Mulliken and L{\""o}wdin representations of the
density matrix, and are tantamount to selecting a well-conditioned set of
projected atomic orbitals (PAOs) and projected (symmetrically-) orthogonalized
atomic orbitals (POAOs), respectively, as proto-LMOs. The SCDM-G variant
leverages a real-space (grid) representation of the wavefunction to select a
set of well-conditioned proto-LMOs. A detailed comparative analysis reveals
that the LMOs generated by these three SCDM variants are robust, comparable in
orbital locality to those produced with the iterative Boys or Pipek-Mezey (PM)
localization schemes, and are agnostic towards any single orbital locality
metric. Although all three SCDM variants are based on the density matrix, we
find that the character of the generated LMOs can differ significantly between
SCDM-M, SCDM-L, and SCDM-G. In this regard, only the grid-based SCDM-G
procedure (like PM) generates LMOs that qualitatively preserve
$\sigma\text{-}\pi$ symmetry and are well-aligned with chemical intuition.
While the direct and standalone use of SCDM-generated LMOs should suffice for
most applications, our findings also suggest that the use of these orbitals as
an unbiased and cost-effective (initial) guess also has the potential to
improve the convergence of iterative orbital localization schemes.

only finitely many times. Roughly, this implies that as $d\to \infty$, there is
a phase transition where $\kappa\theta/d = 1$. For the GHM dynamics, in the

an exponential tail bound for the distribution of the time of the last color

point of concern which remains challenging to study from a numerical point of
view. Standard Monte Carlo analyses are highly expensive because a large number
of particle trajectories need to be integrated over long time scales, and small
time steps must be taken to accurately capture the features of the wide variety
of trajectories. Even when they are based on guiding center trajectories, as
opposed to full-orbit trajectories, these standard Monte Carlo studies are too
expensive to be included in most stellarator optimization codes. We present the
first multifidelity Monte Carlo scheme for accelerating the estimation of
energetic particle confinement in stellarators. Our approach relies on a
two-level hierarchy, in which a guiding center model serves as the
high-fidelity model, and a data-driven linear interpolant is leveraged as the
low-fidelity surrogate model. We apply multifidelity Monte Carlo to the study
of energetic particle confinement in a 4-period quasi-helically symmetric
stellarator, assessing various metrics of confinement. Stemming from the very
high computational efficiency of our surrogate model as well as its sufficient
correlation to the high-fidelity model, we obtain speedups of up to 10 with
multifidelity Monte Carlo compared to standard Monte Carlo.

levels of security in schemes for cryptography. Unfortunately, the potential of
structured light has been restrained to free-space platforms in which the
spatial profile of photons is preserved. Here, we make an important step

a smart high-dimensional encryption protocol in which the propagation of
spatial modes in multimode fibers is used as a natural mechanism for

The information encoded in spatial modes is retrieved using artificial neural
networks, which are trained from the intensity distributions of experimentally
detected spatial modes. Our on-fiber communication platform allows us to use
spatial modes of light for high-dimensional bit-by-bit and byte-by-byte

generating a similar image pair using images taken of nearby locations, and
contrasting these with an image pair that is far apart. The underlying
assumption is that images gathered within a close distance are more likely to
have similar visual appearance, where this can be reasonably satisfied in
seafloor robotic imaging applications where image footprints are limited to
edge lengths of a few metres and are taken so that they overlap along a
vehicle's trajectory, whereas seafloor substrates and habitats have patch sizes

self-supervised and does not require any human input for CNN training. The
method is computationally efficient, where results can be generated between

accessible during most oceanic field trials. We apply GeoCLR to habitat

Reynolds number $500$. This is a prototypical problem of material mixing
featuring laminar, transitional, and turbulent flow, instabilities and coherent
structures, density fluctuations, and production of turbulence kinetic energy
by both shear and buoyancy mechanisms. These features pose numerous challenges
to modeling and simulation, making the RT flow ideal to develop the validation
space of the recently proposed PANS BHR-LEVM closure. The numerical simulations
are conducted at different levels of physical resolution and test three
approaches to set the parameters $f_\phi$ defining the range of physically
resolved scales. The computations demonstrate the efficiency (accuracy vs.
cost) of the PANS model predicting the spatio-temporal development of the RT
flow. Results comparable to large-eddy simulations and direct numerical
simulations are obtained, at significantly lower physical resolution without
the limitations of the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations in these
transitional flows. The data also illustrate the importance of appropriate
selection of the physical resolution and the resolved fraction of each
dependent quantity $\phi$ of the turbulent closure, $f_\phi$. These two aspects
determine the ability of the model to resolve the flow phenomena not amenable
to modeling by the closure and, as such, the computations' fidelity.

distortion and extraneous edges cause inaccurate or spurious detections of line

stochastic watershed transform that is robust to radial distortions, since it
makes no assumptions about line straightness, and is unaffected by the presence
of players or the ball. The line points are then linked to primitive structures
(straight lines and ellipses) thanks to a very efficient procedure that makes
no assumptions about the number of primitives that appear in each image. The
strategy has been tested on a new and public database composed by 60 annotated
images from matches in five stadiums. The results obtained have proven that the
proposed strategy is more robust and accurate than existing approaches,
achieving successful line mark detection even in challenging conditions.

the impact of these active regions on exoplanetary transmission spectra.
Pandora will subsequently identify exoplanets with hydrogen- or water-dominated
atmospheres, and robustly determine which planets are covered by clouds and
hazes. Pandora will observe at least 20 exoplanets with sizes ranging from
Earth-size to Jupiter-size and host stars spanning mid-K to late-M spectral

flows in selected Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS) countries.
The impact of other macro-economic variables on trade flows was also
investigated. Ten countries were selected in eight years period. We decomposed
trade flows into import and export trade. The World Bank Logistics performance
index was used as a measure of logistics performance. The LPI has six
components, and the impact of these components on trade flows were also
examined. The fixed-effect model was used to explain the cross-country result
that was obtained. The results showed that logistics has no significant impact
on both Import and export, thus logistics play no role on trade flows among the
selected ECOWAS countries. The components of logistics except Timeliness of
shipments in reaching the final destination ( CRC ),have no impact on trade
flows. Income was found to be positively related to imports. Exchange rate,
consumption and money supply, reserve and tariff have no significant impact on
imports. Relative import price has an inverse and significant relationship with
imports. GDP has a positive and significant impact on export trade. The study
also found FDI, savings, exchange rate and labour to have insignificant impact
on exports. Finally, we found that logistics is not a driver of trade among the
selected ECOWAS countries. The study recommended the introduction of the single
window system and improvement in border management in order to reduce the cost
associated with Logistics and thereby enhance trade.

joints, or appendages. In many systems, these interactions, and the manner in
which they lead to locomotion, can be understood using the machinery of
geometric mechanics, explaining how inputs in the shape space of a robot affect
motion in its configuration space and the configuration space of its
environment. In this paper we consider an opposite type of locomotion, wherein
robots are influenced actively by interactions with an externally forced
ambient medium. We investigate two examples of externally actuated systems; one
for which locomotion is governed by a principal connection, and is usually
considered to possess no drift dynamics, and another for which no such
connection exists, with drift inherent in its locomotion. For the driftless
system, we develop geometric tools based on previously understood internally
actuated versions of the system and demonstrate their use for motion planning
under external actuation. For the system possessing drift, we employ
nonholonomic reduction to obtain a reduced representation of the system
dynamics, illustrate geometric features conducive to studying locomotion, and
derive strategies for external actuation.

study a ferromagnetic oxide that exhibits an electrically triggered

This switching occurs in a characteristic spatial pattern: the formation of a
transverse insulating barrier inside a metallic matrix resulting in an unusual
ferromagnetic/paramagnetic/ferromagnetic configuration. We found that the
formation of this voltage-driven paramagnetic insulating barrier is accompanied
by the emergence of a strong uniaxial magnetic anisotropy that overpowers the

data. To counter this threat, a versioning solid-state drive (SSD) that
performs versioning inside the SSD has been studied. An SSD is a suitable
candidate for data versioning because it can preserve previous versions without
additional copying, and provide high security with a very small trusted
computing base (TCB). However, the versioning SSDs studied so far commonly use
a full disk versioning method that preserves all file versions in a batch. This
paper demonstrates that SSDs, which provide full disk versioning, can be
exposed to data tampering attacks when the retention time of data is less than
the malware's dwell time. To deal with this threat, we propose SGX-SSD, a
policy-based per-file versioning SSD to keep a deeper history for only the
important files of users. However, since the SSD isn't aware of a file
semantic, and the versioning policy information should be securely received
from the untrusted host computer, implementing the per-file versioning in SSD
is a huge challenge. To solve this problem, SGX-SSD utilizes the Intel SGX and
has a secure host interface to securely receive policy information
(configuration values) from the user. Also, to solve the file semantic
unawareness problem of the SSD, a piggyback module is designed to give a file
hint at the host layer, and an algorithm for selective versioning based on the
policy is implemented in the SSD. To prove our system, we prototyped SGX-SSD
the Jasmine OpenSSD platform in Linux environment. In the experimental

high-dimensional assisted score-based generative model for color image
restoration tasks. Considering that the sample number and internal dimension in
score-based generative model have key influence on estimating the gradients of
data distribution, two different high-dimensional ways are proposed: The
channel-copy transformation increases the sample number and the pixel-scale
transformation decreases feasible space dimension. Subsequently, a set of
high-dimensional tensors represented by these transformations are used to train
the network through denoising score matching. Then, sampling is performed by
annealing Langevin dynamics and alternative data-consistency update.
Furthermore, to alleviate the difficulty of learning high-dimensional
representation, a progressive strategy is proposed to leverage the performance.
The proposed unsupervised learning and iterative restoration algo-rithm, which
involves a pre-trained generative network to obtain prior, has transparent and
clear interpretation compared to other data-driven approaches. Experimental
results on demosaicking and inpainting conveyed the remarkable performance and
diversity of our proposed method.

under the influence of electromagnetic fields, manifests itself in a variety of
physical systems including non-relativistic ones. For instance, it plays an
essential role in spintronics developed in the past few decades, particularly
by controlling spin current generation and relaxation. In the present work, by
using an extended Caldeira-Leggett model, we elucidate how the interplay
between spin relaxation and momentum dissipation of an open system of a single
spin-$1/2$ particle with a Rashba type SOC is induced by the interactions with
a spinless, three-dimensional environment. Staring from the path integral
formulation for the reduced density matrix of the system, we have derived a set
of coupled nonlinear equations that consists of a quasi-classical Langevin
equation for the momentum with a frictional term and a spin precession
equation. The spin precesses around the effective magnetic field generated by
both the SOC and the frictional term. It is found from analytical and numerical
solutions to these equations that a spin torque effect included in the
effective magnetic field causes a spin relaxation and that the spin and
momentum orientations after a long time evolution are largely controlled by the
Rashba coupling strength. Such a spin relaxation mechanism is qualitatively
different from, e.g., the one encountered in semiconductors where essentially
no momentum dissipation occurs due to the Pauli blocking.

a cycle generative adversarial network (GAN) to eliminate the style difference

translation were detected by the ResNet, and were used in triangulation
optimization for 3D-to-2D registration of the skull in actual dual-fluoroscope

the KG with user-item interactions into a tripartite graph, recent works
explore the graph topologies to learn the low-dimensional representations of

Lorentzian Knowledge-enhanced Graph convolutional networks for Recommendation

the data unification. Specifically, we employ different information propagation
strategies in the hyperbolic space to explicitly encode heterogeneous

of the drive field is varied. Notably, the Dirac dispersion can be restored in
real time relative to the gapped equilibrium state, which may enable the
creation of an optoelectronic switch or a dynamically tunable electronic
waveguide. As the amplitude is increased, the ability to shift the quasienergy
gap between high-symmetry points can change which crystal momenta dominate in
the scattering processes relevant to electronic transport and optical emission.
Furthermore, the bands can be flattened near the $\Gamma$ point, which is
indicative of selective dynamical localization. Lastly, quadratic and linear
dispersions emerge in orthogonal directions at the $M$ point, signaling a
Floquet semi-Dirac material. Importantly, all our predictions are valid for
experimentally accessible near-IR radiation, which corresponds to the above

around a binary companion. We revisit both analytical models and 3D simulations
of a wind from an orbiting red giant star, and extend the numerical simulations
to the case of a binary with two red giants with strong winds. We find that
most two-wind models on the orbital plane show a ""double spiral"" structure
close to the binary source, and that these two arms merge into a single spiral
structure at larger distances. However, for the case of a binary with two
identical winds the two spiral arms are still present at large distances from

from both winds. Also, an approximately conical region centered on the orbital
axis is filled exclusively by the wind with larger momentum rate. These two
structures lead to morphologies reminiscent of the so-called ""hour glass""

makes J^sat(u) zero. We search for such u in a vector space R^n by cost
minimization, i.e., starting from an initial u_0 and minimizing J to zero while
iteratively updating u by Newton's method. We implemented our approach as a
matrix-based differential SAT solver MatSat. Although existing main-stream SAT
solvers decide each bit of a solution assignment one by one, be they of
conflict driven clause learning (CDCL) type or of stochastic local search (SLS)

solution in a vector space. We conducted an experiment to measure the
scalability of MatSat with random 3-SAT problems in which MatSat could find a
solution up to n=10^5 variables. We also compared MatSat with four
state-of-the-art SAT solvers including winners of SAT competition 2018 and SAT

by several researchers over the last 5 years after being introduced by Kitson

general normed spaces, despite being intensely studied in the Euclidean context
by many groups over the last 40 years. In order to understand global rigidity
in $X$, we introduce new generalised rigid body motions in normed planes where
the norm is determined by an analytic function. This theory allows us to deduce
several geometric and combinatorial results concerning the global rigidity of

time step size for explicit methods is affected by the magnitude of the
coefficient parameter. With a suitable construction of multiscale space, one
can achieve a stable temporal splitting scheme where the time step size is
independent of the contrast. Consider the parabolic equation with heterogeneous
diffusion parameter, the flow rates vary significantly in different regions due
to the high-contrast features of the diffusivity. In this work, we aim to
introduce a multirate partially explicit splitting scheme to achieve efficient
simulation with the desired accuracy. We first design multiscale subspaces to
handle flow with different speed. For the fast flow, we obtain a
low-dimensional subspace with respect to the high-diffusive component and adopt
an implicit time discretization scheme. The other multiscale subspace will take
care of the slow flow, and the corresponding degrees of freedom are treated
explicitly. Then a multirate time stepping is introduced for the two parts. The
stability of the multirate methods is analyzed for the partially explicit
scheme. Moreover, we derive local error estimators corresponding to the two
components of the solutions and provide an upper bound of the errors. An
adaptive local temporal refinement framework is then proposed to achieve higher
computational efficiency. Several numerical tests are presented to demonstrate
the performance of the proposed method.

and requires a high level of understanding of radiologic expertise. Recently,
deep convolutional neural networks (D-CNNs) have shown remarkable performance
in interpreting CXR in adults. However, there is a lack of evidence indicating
that D-CNNs can recognize accurately multiple lung pathologies from pediatric
CXR scans. In particular, the development of diagnostic models for the
detection of pediatric chest diseases faces significant challenges such as (i)
lack of physician-annotated datasets and (ii) class imbalance problems. In this
paper, we retrospectively collect a large dataset of 5,017 pediatric CXR scans,
for which each is manually labeled by an experienced radiologist for the
presence of 10 common pathologies. A D-CNN model is then trained on 3,550
annotated scans to classify multiple pediatric lung pathologies automatically.
To address the high-class imbalance issue, we propose to modify and apply
""Distribution-Balanced loss"" for training D-CNNs which reshapes the standard
Binary-Cross Entropy loss (BCE) to efficiently learn harder samples by
down-weighting the loss assigned to the majority classes. On an independent
test set of 777 studies, the proposed approach yields an area under the
receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 0.709 (95% CI, 0.690-0.729). The
sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score at the cutoff value are 0.722
(0.694-0.750), 0.579 (0.563-0.595), and 0.389 (0.373-0.405), respectively.
These results significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art methods on
most of the target diseases. Moreover, our ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of the proposed loss function compared to other standard losses,
e.g., BCE and Focal Loss, for this learning task. Overall, we demonstrate the
potential of D-CNNs in interpreting pediatric CXRs.

hand, for short periodicity superlattices, order-disorder-antiorder transition
can be engineered by mediating the substrate strain, due to the delicate
competition between the depoling effect, interfacial coupling, and strain
effect. We envision this study to spur further interest towards the
understanding of order-disorder transition in ferroelectric topological
structures.

specified AI model. This challenge raises the need for an automated and
efficient approach to classifying body parts from X-ray scans. Unfortunately,
to the best of our knowledge, there is no open tool or framework for this task
to date. To fill this lack, we introduce a DICOM Imaging Router that deploys
deep CNNs for categorizing unknown DICOM X-ray images into five anatomical
groups: abdominal, adult chest, pediatric chest, spine, and others. To this
end, a large-scale X-ray dataset consisting of 16,093 images has been collected
and manually classified. We then trained a set of state-of-the-art deep CNNs
using a training set of 11,263 images. These networks were then evaluated on an
independent test set of 2,419 images and showed superior performance in
classifying the body parts. Specifically, our best performing model achieved a
recall of 0.982 (95% CI, 0.977-0.988), a precision of 0.985 (95% CI,
0.975-0.989) and a F1-score of 0.981 (95% CI, 0.976-0.987), whilst requiring
less computation for inference (0.0295 second per image). Our external validity

providing potential benefits for a wide range of applications in clinical

visual representations for downstream tasks while preserving data privacy. To
address this problem, we propose a novel federated unsupervised learning

to introduce reprogrammability to elastic meta-materials. One example of this
is the soft morphable sheet, in which bistable elements that can be snapped up
or down, are embedded within a soft sheet. The state of the sheet can then be
programmed by snapping particular elements up or down, resulting in different
global shapes. However, attempts to leverage this programmability have been
limited by the tendency for the deformations induced by multiple elastic
elements to cause large global shape bifurcations. We study the root cause of
this bifurcation in the soft morphable sheet by developing a detailed
understanding of the behaviour of a single bistable element attached to a flat
'skirt' region. We study the geometrical limitations on the bistability of this
single element, and show that the structure of its deformation can be
understood using a boundary layer analysis. Moreover, by studying the
compressive strains that a single bistable element induces in the surrounding
skirt we show that the shape bifurcation in the soft morphable sheet can be
delayed by an appropriate design of the lattice on which bistable elements are
placed.

(ADS) is to facilitate positive perceptions (e.g., fairness or trustworthiness)
of users towards such systems. This viewpoint, however, makes the implicit
assumption that a given ADS is fair and trustworthy, to begin with. If the ADS
issues unfair outcomes, then one might expect that explanations regarding the
system's workings will reveal its shortcomings and, hence, lead to a decrease
in fairness perceptions. Consequently, we suggest that it is more meaningful to
evaluate explanations against their effectiveness in enabling people to
appropriately assess the quality (e.g., fairness) of an associated ADS. We
argue that for an effective explanation, perceptions of fairness should
increase if and only if the underlying ADS is fair. In this in-progress work,
we introduce the desideratum of appropriate fairness perceptions, propose a
novel study design for evaluating it, and outline next steps towards a
comprehensive experiment.

recommendation systems and traffic prediction, given the rich node features and
edges information. However, these high-dimensional features and high-order
adjacency information are usually heterogeneous and held by different data
holders in practice. Given such vertical data partition (e.g., one data holder
will only own either the node features or edge information), different data
holders have to develop efficient joint training protocols rather than directly
transfer data to each other due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we focus on
the edge privacy, and consider a training scenario where Bob with node features
will first send training node features to Alice who owns the adjacency
information. Alice will then train a graph neural network (GNN) with the joint
information and release an inference API. During inference, Bob is able to
provide test node features and query the API to obtain the predictions for test
nodes. Under this setting, we first propose a privacy attack LinkTeller via
influence analysis to infer the private edge information held by Alice via
designing adversarial queries for Bob. We then empirically show that LinkTeller
is able to recover a significant amount of private edges, outperforming
existing baselines. To further evaluate the privacy leakage, we adapt an
existing algorithm for differentially private graph convolutional network (DP
GCN) training and propose a new DP GCN mechanism LapGraph. We show that these
DP GCN mechanisms are not always resilient against LinkTeller empirically under
mild privacy guarantees ($\varepsilon>5$). Our studies will shed light on
future research towards designing more resilient privacy-preserving GCN models;
in the meantime, provide an in-depth understanding of the tradeoff between GCN

the best of our knowledge, that allows a CSP to perform efficient

association study - GWAS) over multi-tenant encrypted phenotype data (owned by
multiple hospitals or data owners). We first propose an encryption mechanism
for phenotype data, where each data owner is allowed to encrypt its data with a
unique secret key. Moreover, the ciphertext supports privacy-preserving search
and, consequently, enables the selection of the target group of patients (e.g.,
case and control groups). In addition, we provide a per-query based
authorization mechanism for a client to access and operate on the data stored
at the CSP. Based on the identified patients, the proposed scheme can either
(i) directly conduct GWAS (i.e., computation of statistics about genomic
variants) at the CSP or (ii) provide the identified groups to the client to
directly query the corresponding data owners and conduct GWAS using existing
distributed solutions. We implement the proposed scheme and run experiments

that the proposed solution is capable to efficiently identify the case/control

$s$ and energy $E$ emitted during the avalanche are highly correlated producing
the same distribution for both $P(s)$ and $Q(E)$: a scale-free distribution

such correlation $C(\gamma)$ between $s$ and $E$ decreases where the nature of
the decreases depends highly on the dimension of the bundle. In 1d, the

distance-based order parameters can be applied to compute the free-energy
landscapes associated with mechanical deformations of large DNA nanostructures.
We illustrate this approach for the strong bending of DNA nanotubes and the
potentially bistable landscape of twisted DNA origami sheets. The homogeneous
bending of the DNA nanotubes is well described by the worm-like chain model;
for more extreme bending the nanotubes reversibly buckle with the bending
deformations localized at one or two ""kinks"". For a twisted one-layer DNA
origami, the twist is coupled to the bending of the sheet giving rise to a
free-energy landscape that has two nearly-degenerate minima that have opposite
curvatures. By contrast, for a two-layer origami, the increased stiffness with
respect to bending leads to a landscape with a single free-energy minimum that
has a saddle-like geometry. The ability to compute such landscapes is likely to
be particularly useful for DNA mechanotechnology and for understanding stress
accumulation during the self-assembly of origamis into higher-order structures.

that is applicable to a clinical brain MRI database, we propose a new framework
-- Disease-oriented image embedding with pseudo-scanner standardization
(DI-PSS) -- that consists of two core techniques, data harmonization and a
dimension reduction algorithm. Our DI-PSS uses skull stripping and
CycleGAN-based image transformations that map to a standard brain followed by
transformation into a brain image taken with a given reference scanner. Then,
our 3D convolutioinal autoencoders (3D-CAE) with deep metric learning acquires
a low-dimensional embedding that better reflects the characteristics of the
disease. The effectiveness of our proposed framework was tested on the
T1-weighted MRIs selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
and the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. We confirmed that our PSS
greatly reduced the variability of low-dimensional embeddings caused by
different scanner and datasets. Compared with the baseline condition, our PSS
reduced the variability in the distance from Alzheimer's disease (AD) to
clinically normal (CN) and Parkinson disease (PD) cases by 15.8-22.6% and
18.0-29.9%, respectively. These properties allow DI-PSS to generate lower
dimensional representations that are more amenable to disease classification.
In AD and CN classification experiments based on spectral clustering, PSS
improved the average accuracy and macro-F1 by 6.2% and 10.7%, respectively.
Given the potential of the DI-PSS for harmonizing images scanned by MRI
scanners that were not used to scan the training data, we expect that the
DI-PSS is suitable for application to a large number of legacy MRIs scanned in
heterogeneous environments.

and functionality of neurons in brain circuit activities. However, the
performance of existing tracing algorithms is hinged by the low image quality.
Recently, a series of deep learning based segmentation methods have been
proposed to improve the quality of raw 3D optical image stacks by removing
noises and restoring neuronal structures from low-contrast background. Due to
the variety of neuron morphology and the lack of large neuron datasets, most of
current neuron segmentation models rely on introducing complex and
specially-designed submodules to a base architecture with the aim of encoding
better feature representations. Though successful, extra burden would be put on
computation during inference. Therefore, rather than modifying the base
network, we shift our focus to the dataset itself. The encoder-decoder backbone
used in most neuron segmentation models attends only intra-volume voxel points
to learn structural features of neurons but neglect the shared intrinsic
semantic features of voxels belonging to the same category among different
volumes, which is also important for expressive representation learning. Hence,
to better utilise the scarce dataset, we propose to explicitly exploit such
intrinsic features of voxels through a novel voxel-level cross-volume
representation learning paradigm on the basis of an encoder-decoder
segmentation model. Our method introduces no extra cost during inference.
Evaluated on 42 3D neuron images from BigNeuron project, our proposed method is
demonstrated to improve the learning ability of the original segmentation model
and further enhancing the reconstruction performance.

select snippets of high probabilities of actions or namely the foreground.
Nevertheless, the existing foreground selection strategies have a major
limitation of only considering the unilateral relation from foreground to
actions, which cannot guarantee the foreground-action consistency. In this
paper, we present a framework named FAC-Net based on the I3D backbone, on which
three branches are appended, named class-wise foreground classification branch,
class-agnostic attention branch and multiple instance learning branch. First,
our class-wise foreground classification branch regularizes the relation
between actions and foreground to maximize the foreground-background
separation. Besides, the class-agnostic attention branch and multiple instance
learning branch are adopted to regularize the foreground-action consistency and
help to learn a meaningful foreground classifier. Within each branch, we
introduce a hybrid attention mechanism, which calculates multiple attention
scores for each snippet, to focus on both discriminative and
less-discriminative snippets to capture the full action boundaries.
Experimental results on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3 demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of our method. Our code is available at

idea is to transfer fractions of knowledge, opposed to discarding potentially

in authentication is omitted and this design is further combined with the SEI
encryption design using honey encryption. The login password merely serves as a
temporary key to encrypt SEI and there is no password plaintext or ciphertext
stored in the database. During the login, the server doesn't check the login
passwords, correct passwords decrypt ciphertexts to be correct plaintexts;
incorrect passwords decrypt ciphertexts to be phony but plausible-looking
plaintexts (sampled from the same distribution). And these two situations share
the same undifferentiated backend procedures. This scheme eliminates the anchor

this paper presents four SEIGuard scheme designs and algorithms for 4 typical

predicting pixel-wise semantic labels for seen and unseen classes. Most GZS3
methods adopt a generative approach that synthesizes visual features of unseen
classes from corresponding semantic ones (e.g., word2vec) to train novel
classifiers for both seen and unseen classes. Although generative methods show
decent performance, they have two limitations: (1) the visual features are
biased towards seen classes; (2) the classifier should be retrained whenever
novel unseen classes appear. We propose a discriminative approach to address
these limitations in a unified framework. To this end, we leverage visual and
semantic encoders to learn a joint embedding space, where the semantic encoder
transforms semantic features to semantic prototypes that act as centers for
visual features of corresponding classes. Specifically, we introduce
boundary-aware regression (BAR) and semantic consistency (SC) losses to learn
discriminative features. Our approach to exploiting the joint embedding space,
together with BAR and SC terms, alleviates the seen bias problem. At test time,
we avoid the retraining process by exploiting semantic prototypes as a
nearest-neighbor (NN) classifier. To further alleviate the bias problem, we

a negative spin projection onto the orbital angular momentum, with about $90\%$

evolution of massive binary stars in the field, since their dynamical formation
in dense star clusters is strongly suppressed by mass segregation. In this
paper, we carry out a systematic statistical study of the binary stars that

into account the uncertainties on the natal kick distributions for BHs and NSs

the initial stellar spins are aligned with the binary angular momentum, we show
that both large natal kicks ($\gtrsim 150$ km s$^{-1}$) and high efficiencies

inferred high merger rates and the large spin-orbit misalignment of GW200115.

interactions. However, several real-world networks such as social networks,
neuronal networks, etc., involve interactions between more than two nodes.
Simplicial complexes provide a powerful mathematical framework to model such
higher-order interactions. It is well known that the spectrum of the graph
Laplacian is indicative of community structure, and this relation is exploited
by spectral clustering algorithms. Here we propose that the spectrum of the
Hodge Laplacian, a higher-order Laplacian defined on simplicial complexes,
encodes simplicial communities. We formulate an algorithm to extract simplicial
communities (of arbitrary dimension). We apply this algorithm to simplicial
complex benchmarks and to real higher-order network data including social
networks and networks extracted using language or text processing tools.
However, datasets of simplicial complexes are scarce, and for the vast majority
of datasets that may involve higher-order interactions, only the set of
pairwise interactions are available. Hence, we use known properties of the data
to infer the most likely higher-order interactions. In other words, we
introduce an inference method to predict the most likely simplicial complex
given the community structure of its network skeleton. This method identifies
as most likely the higher-order interactions inducing simplicial communities
that maximize the adjusted mutual information measured with respect to
ground-truth community structure. Finally, we consider higher-order networks
constructed through thresholding the edge weights of collaboration networks
(encoding only pairwise interactions) and provide an example of persistent
simplicial communities that are sustained over a wide range of the threshold.

and the updating of PDFs by directly using the same $A_{FB}$ spectrum are
strongly correlated. This correlation would introduce large bias or uncertainty

that the sensitivity of $A_{FB}$ on $\sin^2 \theta_{W}$ is dominated by its
average value around the $Z$ pole region, while the shape (or gradient) of the
$A_{FB}$ spectrum is insensitive to $\sin^2 \theta_{W}$ and contains important

significantly reduce the potential bias on the determination of $\sin^2

the vertebral discs in MRI data is a difficult task because of the similarity
between discs and bone area, the variability in the geometry of the spine and
surrounding tissues across individuals, and the variability across scans
(manufacturers, pulse sequence, image contrast, resolution and artefacts). In
previous studies, vertebral disc labeling is often done after a disc detection
step and mostly fails when the localization algorithm misses discs or has false
positive detection. In this work, we aim to mitigate this problem by
reformulating the semantic vertebral disc labeling using the pose estimation
technique. To do so, we propose a stacked hourglass network with multi-level
attention mechanism to jointly learn intervertebral disc position and their
skeleton structure. The proposed deep learning model takes into account the
strength of semantic segmentation and pose estimation technique to handle the
missing area and false positive detection. To further improve the performance
of the proposed method, we propose a skeleton-based search space to reduce
false positive detection. The proposed method evaluated on spine generic public

  Near-term Quantum Error Correction","13 pages,17 Figures, 6 Tables",,,,"quant-ph cs.AR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The error rates of quantum devices are orders of magnitude higher than what
is needed to run most quantum applications. To close this gap, Quantum Error
Correction (QEC) encodes logical qubits and distributes information using
several physical qubits. By periodically executing a syndrome extraction
circuit on the logical qubits, information about errors (called syndrome) is
extracted while running programs. A decoder uses these syndromes to identify
and correct errors in real time, which is required to use feedback implemented
in quantum algorithms. Unfortunately, software decoders are slow and hardware
decoders are fast but less accurate. Thus, almost all QEC studies so far have
relied on offline decoding.
  To enable real-time decoding in near-term QEC, we propose LILLIPUT-- a
Lightweight Low Latency Look-Up Table decoder. LILLIPUT consists of two parts--
First, it translates syndromes into error detection events that index into a
Look-Up Table (LUT) whose entry provides the error information in real-time.
Second, it programs the LUTs with error assignments for all possible error
events by running a software decoder offline. LILLIPUT tolerates an error on
any operation in the quantum hardware, including gates and measurement, and the
number of tolerated errors grows with the size of the code. It needs <7% logic
on off-the-shelf FPGAs that allows it to be easily integrated alongside the
control and readout circuits in existing systems. LILLIPUT incurs a latency of
few nanoseconds and enables real-time decoding. We also propose Compressed LUTs
(CLUTs) to reduce the memory needed by LILLIPUT. By exploiting the fact that
not all error events are equally likely and only storing data for the most
probable error events, CLUTs reduce the memory needed by up-to 107x (from 148
MB to 1.38 MB) without degrading accuracy.

modeled by neural networks and the macroscopic states of a society of such
agents in a few situations. Mathematical quantification of surprise, distrust
of other agents and confidence about its opinion emerge as essential
ingredients in the entropy based learning dynamics. Learning is shown to be
driven by surprises, i.e. the receptor agent is confronted with the concurring
opinion of a distrusted agent or with a trusted agent's disagreeing opinion.
Attribution of blame for the surprise derives from measures of distrust of the
receiver towards the emitter agent and the receiver's confidence about its own
opinion. The dynamics proceeds by changes of mainly one or the other: the
receptor opinion about the issue or the distrust about the emitter. A society
with $N$ agents exchanging binary opinions about a set of issues show rich
behavior which depend on the complexity of the agenda. For small sets the
society reaches a steady state polarized into antagonistic factions, where
balanced norms such as ""the friend of an enemy is an enemy"" are strictly
satisfied. For larger sets of issues, societies can persist for a long time in
spin-glass like states. There are two types of frustration: ideological and
affective, with dynamical annealing properties depending on the complexity of
the set of questions under discussion, leading to the lack of sharply defined
parties for long transients.

an electron is a natural part of its space-time path as a point particle. The
fourth-order equation of motion corresponds to the same Lagrangian function in
proper time as in special relativity except for an additional spin energy term.
The total motion can be decomposed into a sum of a local spin motion about a
point and a global motion of this point, called the spin center. The global
motion is sub-luminal and obeys Newton's second law in proper time, the time
for a clock fixed at the spin center, while the total motion occurs at the
speed of light c, consistent with the eigenvalues of Dirac's velocity operators
having magnitude c. The local spin motion corresponds to Schr\""odinger's
zitterbewegung and is a perpetual motion, which for a free electron has a
circular path in the spin-center frame. In an electro-magnetic field, this spin
motion generates magnetic and electric dipole energies through the Lorentz
force on the electron's point charge. The corresponding electric dipole energy
is consistent with the spin-orbit coupling term in the corrected Pauli
non-relativistic Hamiltonian but the magnetic dipole energy is one half of that
in Dirac's theory. By defining a spin tensor as the angular momentum of the
electron's total motion about its spin center, the fundamental equations of
motion can be re-written in an identical form to those of the Barut-Zanghi
electron theory. These equations of motion can then be expressed using
operators applied to a state function of proper time satisfying a
Dirac-Schr\""odinger spinor equation. The operators produce dynamic variables
without any probability implications. For the free electron, the state function
satisfies Dirac's relativistic wave equation when the Lorentz transformation is
applied to express proper time in terms of an observer's space-time
coordinates.

  ADHD by Deep Learning","10 pages, 6 figures",,,,"eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Attention Deficit\Hyperactivity Disorder(ADHD) is considered a very common
psychiatric disorder, but it is difficult to establish an accurate diagnostic
method for ADHD. Recently, with the development of computing resources and
machine learning methods, studies have been conducted to classify ADHD using
resting-state functional magnetic resonance(rsfMRI) imaging data. However, most
of them utilized all areas of the brain for training the models. In this study,
as a different way from this approach, we conducted a study to classify ADHD by
selecting areas that are essential for using a deep learning model. For the
experiment, rsfMRI data provided by ADHD 200 global competition was used. To
obtain an integrated result from the multiple sites, each region of the brain
was evaluated with Leave one site out cross-validation. As a result, when we
only used 15 important region of interest(ROIs) for training, an accuracy of
70.6% was obtained, significantly exceeding the existing results of 68.6% from
all ROIs. In addition, to explore the new structure based on SCCNN-RNN, we
performed the same experiment with three modified models: (1) Separate Channel
CNN RNN with Attention (ASCRNN), (2) Separate Channel dilate CNN RNN with
Attention (ASDRNN), (3) Separate Channel CNN slicing RNN with Attention
(ASSRNN). As a result, the ASSRNN model provided a high accuracy of 70.46% when
training with only 13 important region of interest (ROI). These results show
that finding and using the crucial parts of the brain in diagnosing ADHD by
Deep Learning can get better results than using all areas.

  reservoir computing",,,,,"math.DS nlin.CD","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This study is focused on the qualitative and quantitative characterization of
chaotic systems with the use of symbolic description. We consider two famous
systems: Lorenz and R\""ossler models with their iconic attractors, and
demonstrate that with adequately chosen symbolic partition three measures of
complexity, such as the Shannon source entropy, the Lempel-Ziv complexity and
the Markov transition matrix, work remarkably well for characterizing the
degree of chaoticity, and precise detecting stability windows in the parameter
space. The second message of this study is to showcase the utility of symbolic
dynamics with the introduction of a fidelity test for reservoir computing for
simulating the properties of the chaos in both models' replicas. The results of
these measures are validated by the comparison approach based on
one-dimensional return maps and the complexity measures.

thin sheets with hyperbolic basis functions derived from the well-known
steady-state solution of the linear flux diffusion equation. The combination of
solutions at different operating frequencies permits the representation of the
time-evolution of field quantities in the magnetic field formulation. This
approach is here applied to solve a planar shielding problem in harmonic and
time-dependent simulations for materials with either linear or nonlinear
characteristics. Local and global quantities show good agreement with the
reference solutions obtained by the standard finite element method on a
complete and representative discretization of the region exposed to a
time-varying magnetic field.

``Jekyll`` produces a video bit-mask describing an estimate of the locations of

the original input image sequence. These models were trained with a
custom-modified version of Cross Entropy Loss.
  Simulated data were used to compare the performance of Jekyll and Hyde

from these comparisons show that the unsupervised methods developed are
competitive in output quality with supervised techniques, without the
associated cost of acquiring labeled training data.

proper labels from COVID-19 Tweets to provide an overview of wider public
opinion. Nowadays, social media is one of the best ways to connect people
through Internet technology, which is also considered an essential part of our
daily lives. In late December 2019, an outbreak of the novel coronavirus,
COVID-19 was reported, and the World Health Organization declared an emergency
due to its rapid spread all over the world. The COVID-19 epidemic has affected
the use of social media by many people across the globe. Twitter is one of the
most influential social media services, which has seen a dramatic increase in
its use from the epidemic. Thus dynamic extraction of specific topics with
labels from tweets of COVID-19 is a challenging issue for highlighting
conversation instead of manual topic labeling approach. In this paper, we
propose a framework that automatically identifies the key topics with labels
from the tweets using the top Unigram feature of aspect terms cluster from
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) generated topics. Our experiment result shows
that this dynamic topic identification and labeling approach is effective
having the accuracy of 85.48\% with respect to the manual static approach.

whereas microscopy is often inaccurate beyond the resolution limit. To address
these issues, we advance and integrate these complementary methods, introducing
simultaneous measurements of the same microdroplets, comprehensive calibrations
that are independently traceable to the International System of Units (SI), and
Monte-Carlo evaluations of volumetric uncertainty. We achieve sub-picoliter
agreement of measurements of microdroplets in flight with volumes of
approximately 70 pL, with ensemble gravimetry and optical microscopy both
yielding 95% coverage intervals of +/- 0.6 pL, or relative uncertainties of +/-
0.9%, and root-mean-square deviations of mean values between the two methods of
0.2 pL or 0.3%. These uncertainties match previous gravimetry results and
improve upon previous microscopy results by an order of magnitude. Gravimetry
precision depends on the continuity of droplet formation, whereas microscopy
accuracy requires that optical diffraction from an edge reference matches that
from a microdroplet. Applying our microscopy method, we jet and image water
microdroplets suspending fluorescent nanoplastics, count nanoplastic particles
after deposition and evaporation, and transfer volumetric traceability to
number concentration. We expect that our methods will impact diverse fields
involving dimensional metrology and volumetric analysis of microdroplets,
including inkjet microfabrication, disease transmission, and industrial sprays.
