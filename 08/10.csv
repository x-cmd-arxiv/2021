  Adaptive Cruise Control",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper demonstrates that the acceleration/deceleration limits in ACC
systems can make a string stable ACC amplify the speed perturbation in natural
driving. It is shown that the constrained acceleration/deceleration of the
following ACCs are likely to cause speed overshoot to compensate for an extra
large/small spacing. Additionally, we find that the constrained deceleration
limits can also jeopardize safety, as the limited braking power produces extra
small spacing or even crashes. The findings are validated through experiments
on real cars. The paper suggests that the ACC parameter space should be
extended to include the acceleration/deceleration limits considering their
significant role exposed here. Through numerical simulations of ACC platoons,
we show i) a marginal string stable ACC is preferable due to the smaller total
queue length and the shorter duration in congestion; ii) congestion waves in a
mixed ACC platoon largely depend on the sequence of vehicles provided different
acceleration/deceleration limits, and iii) the safety hazard caused by the
constrained deceleration limits is more significant in mixed ACC platoons when
string unstable ACCs exist.

(DWI) often limit the spatial resolution of the produced images to voxels up to
8 times larger than those of T1w images. Thus, the detailed information
contained in T1w imagescould help in the synthesis of diffusion images in
higher resolution. However, the non-Euclidean nature of diffusion imaging
hinders current deep generative models from synthesizing physically plausible
images. In this work, we propose the first Riemannian network architecture for
the direct generation of diffusion tensors (DT) and diffusion orientation
distribution functions (dODFs) from high-resolution T1w images. Our integration
of the Log-Euclidean Metric into a learning objective guarantees, unlike
standard Euclidean networks, the mathematically-valid synthesis of diffusion.
Furthermore, our approach improves the fractional anisotropy mean squared error
(FA MSE) between the synthesized diffusion and the ground-truth by more than
23% and the cosine similarity between principal directions by almost 5% when
compared to our baselines. We validate our generated diffusion by comparing the
resulting tractograms to our expected real data. We observe similar fiber
bundles with streamlines having less than 3% difference in length, less than 1%
difference in volume, and a visually close shape. While our method is able to
generate high-resolution diffusion images from structural inputs in less than
15 seconds, we acknowledge and discuss the limits of diffusion inference solely
relying on T1w images. Our results nonetheless suggest a relationship between
the high-level geometry of the brain and the overall white matter architecture.

a parliament should be allocated to each party as a result of an election. The
divisor methods provide a way of solving this problem by defining a notion of
proportionality guided by some rounding rule. Motivated by recent challenges in
the context of electoral apportionment, we consider the question of how to
allocate the seats of a parliament under parity constraints between candidate
types (e.g. equal number of men and women elected) while at the same time
satisfying party proportionality.
  We consider two different approaches for this problem. The first mechanism,
that follows a greedy approach, corresponds to a recent mechanism used in the
Chilean Constitutional Convention 2021 election. We analyze this mechanism from
a theoretical point of view. The second mechanism follows the idea of
biproportionality introduced by Balinski and Demange [Math. Program. 1989,
Math. Oper. Res. 1989]. In contrast with the classic biproportional method by
Balinski and Demange, this mechanism is ruled by two levels of proportionality:
Proportionality is satisfied at the level of parties by means of a divisor
method, and then biproportionality is used to decide the number of candidates
allocated to each type and party. We provide a theoretical analysis of this
mechanism, making progress on the theoretical understanding of methods with two
levels of proportionality. A typical benchmark used in the context of
two-dimensional apportionment is the fair share (a.k.a matrix scaling), which
corresponds to an ideal fractional biproportional solution. We provide lower
bounds on the distance between these two types of solutions, and we explore
their consequences in the context of two-dimensional apportionment.

electron detachment is E = 67 V/m/Pa at the tip. The field enhancement,
Etip/Eambient, at the GCPO tip depends only on its length:tip radius of
curvature ratio. Thus, Etip at all GCPOs is substantially enhanced by Eambient,
whether or not they are in corona. Cosmic ray electrons striking these pointy
tips will gain MeV energies. These high energy electrons may be detected with
instrumentation located nearby, or they may produce gamma rays via
bremsstrahlung within the tips before being detected, thereby contributing to

for closed-loop systems, but they also introduce challenges in formally
analyzing those systems' safety properties. In particular, this work focuses on
estimating the forward reachable set of \textit{neural feedback loops}
(closed-loop systems with NN controllers). Recent work provides bounds on these
reachable sets, but the computationally tractable approaches yield overly
conservative bounds (thus cannot be used to verify useful properties), and the
methods that yield tighter bounds are too intensive for online computation.
This work bridges the gap by formulating a convex optimization problem for the
reachability analysis of closed-loop systems with NN controllers. While the
solutions are less tight than previous (semidefinite program-based) methods,
they are substantially faster to compute, and some of those computational time
savings can be used to refine the bounds through new input set partitioning
techniques, which is shown to dramatically reduce the tightness gap. The new
framework is developed for systems with uncertainty (e.g., measurement and
process noise) and nonlinearities (e.g., polynomial dynamics), and thus is
shown to be applicable to real-world systems. To inform the design of an
initial state set when only the target state set is known/specified, a novel
algorithm for backward reachability analysis is also provided, which computes
the set of states that are guaranteed to lead to the target set. The numerical
experiments show that our approach (based on linear relaxations and
partitioning) gives a $5\times$ reduction in conservatism in $150\times$ less
computation time compared to the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, experiments on
quadrotor, 270-state, and polynomial systems demonstrate the method's ability
to handle uncertainty sources, high dimensionality, and nonlinear dynamics,

some known to be harmful to biota and humans. To provide a first tool for
assessing the role of microplastics as vectors of plastic-related organic
pollutants (PROPs), we developed a data-informed model that accounts for the
intertwined dynamics of Lagrangian microplastic particles transported by
surface currents and the Eulerian advection-diffusion of chemicals that
partition on them through seawater-particle interaction. Focusing on the
Mediterranean Sea and using simple, yet realistic forcings for the input of
PROPs, our simulations highlight that microplastics can mediate PROP export
across different sub-seas. Particle origin, in terms of both source type
(either coastal, riverine, or fishing-derived) and geographical location, seems
to play a major role in determining the amount of PROPs conveyed by
microplastics during their journey at sea. We argue that quantitative numerical
modelling approaches can be focal to shed some light on the vast spatial and
temporal scales of microplastics-PROPs interaction, complementary to
much-needed on-field investigation.

deep convective clouds, the nightside is dominated by low-level clouds, and
these two are linked by a global-scale Walker circulation. We further find that
a uniform surface warming causes the substellar cloud width to decrease, but a
reduction in day-night surface temperature contrast or an increase in longwave
radiative cooling rate causes the substellar cloud width to increase. These
relationships can be roughly interpreted based on simple thermodynamic
theories. Comparing the results between CRM and global 3D general circulation
model (GCM), we find that they show qualitatively consistent results, including
the Walker circulation, the substellar clouds, and the responses of the
substellar ascending area and strength to changes in surface temperature or in
its zonal contrast. But, large quantitative differences exist, such as the
magnitude of cloud water path, the cloud width, and their responses to external
forcings. These results increase our confidence in using GCMs for modeling
exoplanetary climates, although large quantitative uncertainties should always
exist. Future work is required to use 3D CRM(s) with realistic radiative

shown that, for black holes in a cavity, the vanishing energy flux principle
leads to \textit{two} different sets of boundary conditions. By solving the
Maxwell equations with these two boundary conditions both analytically and
numerically, we observe \textit{two} distinct sets of modes. This indicates
that the vanishing energy flux principle may be applied not only to
asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes but also to black holes in a
cavity. In the analytic calculations, the imaginary part of the Maxwell
quasinormal modes are derived analytically for both boundary conditions, which
match well with the numeric results. While in the numeric calculations, we
complete a thorough study on the two sets of the Maxwell spectrum by varying
the mirror radius $r_m$, the angular momentum quantum number $\ell$, and the
overtone number $N$. In particular, we proclaim that the Maxwell spectrum may
\textit{bifurcate} for both modes when the mirror is placed around the black
hole event horizon, which is analogous to the spectrum bifurcation effects
found for the Maxwell fields on asymptotically AdS black holes. This
observation provides another example to exhibit the similarity between black
holes in a cavity and the AdS black holes.

is commonly detected and quantified by cortico-muscular coherence (CMC) or
Granger causality (GC) analysis, which are applicable only to linear couplings
and are not sufficiently sensitive: some healthy subjects show no significant
CMC and GC, and yet have good motor skills. The objective of this work is to
develop measures of functional cortico-muscular coupling that have improved
sensitivity and are capable of detecting both linear and non-linear
interactions. Methods: A multiscale wavelet transfer entropy (TE) methodology
is proposed. The methodology relies on a dyadic stationary wavelet transform to
decompose electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals into
functional bands of neural oscillations. Then, it applies TE analysis based on
a range of embedding delay vectors to detect and quantify intra- and
cross-frequency band cortico-muscular coupling at different time scales.
Results: Our experiments with neurophysiological signals substantiate the
potential of the developed methodologies for detecting and quantifying
information flow between EEG and EMG signals for subjects with and without
significant CMC or GC, including non-linear cross-frequency interactions, and
interactions across different temporal scales. The obtained results are in
agreement with the underlying sensorimotor neurophysiology. Conclusion: These
findings suggest that the concept of multiscale wavelet TE provides a
comprehensive framework for analysing cortex-muscle interactions. Significance:
The proposed methodologies will enable developing novel insights into movement
control and neurophysiological processes more generally.

the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. In this limit, enlarging the spin and extending the
typical SU(2) symmetry to SU($N$) has been predicted to give exotic phases of
matter in the ground state, with a complicated dependence on $N$. This raises
the question of what -- if any -- are the finite-temperature signatures of
these phases, especially in the currently experimentally relevant regime near
or above the superexchange energy. We explore this question for thermodynamic
observables by numerically calculating the thermodynamics of the SU($N$) FHM in
the two-dimensional square lattice near densities of one particle per site,
using determinant Quantum Monte Carlo and Numerical Linked Cluster Expansion.
Interestingly, we find that for temperatures above the superexchange energy,
where the correlation length is short, the energy, number of on-site pairs, and
kinetic energy are universal functions of $N$. Although the physics in the
regime studied is well beyond what can be captured by low-order
high-temperature series, we show that an analytic description of the scaling is
possible in terms of only one- and two-site calculations.

iridates, have received enormous current interest due to the prediction as well
as the realization of a plethora of exotic and unconventional magnetic
properties. While a bulk of these works are based on tetravalent iridates
($d^5$), where the counter-intuitive insulating state of the rather extended
5$d$ orbitals are explained by invoking strong spin-orbit coupling, the recent
quest in iridate research has shifted to the other valencies of Ir, of which
pentavalent iridates constitute a notable representative. In contrast to the
tetravalent iridates, spin-orbit entangled electrons in $d^4$ systems are
expected to be confined to the $J = 0$ singlet state without any resultant
moment or magnetic response. However, it has been recently predicted that,
magnetism in $d^4$ systems may occur via magnetic condensation of excitations
across spin-orbit-coupled states. In reality, the magnetism in Ir$^{5+}$
systems are often quite debatable both from theoretical as well as experimental
point of view. Here we provide a comprehensive overview of the spin-orbit

charges on it. Taking the interaction potential as the analog of Coulomb
interaction (derived from a fundamental solution of the $S^3$ Laplace-Beltrami

that free motion on the deformed metric is equivalent to motion on the round

expressions for the generators of the conformal algebra in the representation
induced by the metric deformation.

conformal wave operator equation could provide a realistic quantum mechanical
description of the simplest QCD system, the mesons.

$R$, as another scale along $\Lambda_{QCD}$, by means of which, upon

phenomena, including Bose-Einstein condensation of polaritons,
Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) states of polaritons, and photon lasing (lasing
with negligible Coulombic exciton effects). An important aspect of possible
experimental identification of these states is a gap in the excitation spectrum
(the BCS gap in the case of a polaritonic BCS state). Similar to the
polaritonic BCS gap, a light-induced gap can exist in photon lasers. Although
polaritonic BCS states have been observed on the basis of spectroscopy in the
vicinity of the laser frequency, the direct observation of polaritonic BCS gaps
using light spectrally centered at or around the emission frequency has not
been achieved. It has been conjectured that low-frequency (terahertz)
spectroscopy should be able to identify such gaps. In this first of two
studies, a theory aimed at identifying features of light-induced gaps in the
linear terahertz spectroscopy of photon lasers is developed and numerically
evaluated. It is shown that spectral features in the intraband conductivity,
and therefore in the system's transmissivity and absorptivity can be related to
the light-induced gap. For sufficiently small Drude damping this includes
spectral regions of THz gain. A future study will generalize the present
formalism to include Coulomb effects.

part of the elastic scattering matrix for an anisotropic tight-binding model.
We perform simulations by going from the Unitary to the Born scattering limit,
varying the parameter c which is inverse to the strength of the impurity
potential. It is found that the unitary and intermedia limits persist for
different orders of magnitude in simulating the disorder concentration.
Subsequently and in order to find the MN tiny gap, we perform a numerical study
of the unitary limit as a function of disorder concentration, to find the tiny

improved performance and robustness. In fetal brain MRI, abnormalities
exacerbate the variability of the developing brain anatomy compared to
non-pathological cases. A small number of abnormal cases, as is typically
available in clinical datasets used for training, are unlikely to fairly
represent the rich variability of abnormal developing brains. This leads
machine learning systems trained by maximizing the average performance to be
biased toward non-pathological cases. This problem was recently referred to as
hidden stratification. To be suited for clinical use, automatic segmentation
methods need to reliably achieve high-quality segmentation outcomes also for
pathological cases. In this paper, we show that the state-of-the-art deep
learning pipeline nnU-Net has difficulties to generalize to unseen abnormal
cases. To mitigate this problem, we propose to train a deep neural network to
minimize a percentile of the distribution of per-volume loss over the dataset.
We show that this can be achieved by using Distributionally Robust Optimization
(DRO). DRO automatically reweights the training samples with lower performance,
encouraging nnU-Net to perform more consistently on all cases. We validated our
approach using a dataset of 368 fetal brain T2w MRIs, including 124 MRIs of

use of explicit time integrators. Since this approach can lead to significantly

the Hamiltonian is fermionized by introducing the Jordan-Wigner transformation,

stochastic gravitational waves are expected to carry the imprints of primordial
non-Gaussianities. The scalar bispectrum that is typically produced in models
of inflation leading to significant secondary GWs is non-trivial and highly
scale dependent. In this work, we present a method to account for such general
scale dependent scalar bispectrum arising from inflationary models in the
calculation of the spectral density of secondary GWs. Using this method, we
compute the contributions arising from the scalar bispectrum to the amplitude
of secondary GWs in two specific models of inflation driven by the canonical
scalar field. We find that these non-Gaussian contributions can be highly model
dependent and have to be consistently taken into account while estimating the
total amplitude of the secondary GWs. Beyond the models considered, we
emphasize that the method discussed is robust, free from assumptions about the
shape of the bispectrum and generalizes earlier approaches adopted in the
literature. We argue that this method of accounting for the scalar bispectrum
shall be helpful in future computations for exotic models generating larger
amplitudes of scalar non-Gaussianities along with significant amount of
secondary GWs.

  Programming (ICLP 2021), September 2021, 16 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modal logic S5 has attracted significant attention and has led to several
practical applications, owing to its simplified approach to dealing with
nesting modal operators. Efficient implementations for evaluating
satisfiability of S5 formulas commonly rely on Skolemisation to convert them
into propositional logic formulas, essentially by introducing copies of
propositional atoms for each set of interpretations (possible worlds). This
approach is simple, but often results into large formulas that are too
difficult to process, and therefore more parsimonious constructions are
required. In this work, we propose to use Answer Set Programming for
implementing such constructions, and in particular for identifying the
propositional atoms that are relevant in every world by means of a reachability
relation. The proposed encodings are designed to take advantage of other
properties such as entailment relations of subformulas rooted by modal
operators. An empirical assessment of the proposed encodings shows that the
reachability relation is very effective and leads to comparable performance to
a state-of-the-art S5 solver based on SAT, while entailment relations are
possibly too expensive to reason about and may result in overhead. This paper
is under consideration for acceptance in TPLP.

Sologon","The Structure and Incentives of a COVID related Emergency Wage Subsidy",,,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  During recent crisis, wage subsidies played a major role in sheltering firms
and households from economic shocks. During COVID-19, most workers were
affected and many liberal welfare states introduced new temporary wage
subsidies to protected workers' earnings and employment (OECD, 2021). New wage
subsidies marked a departure from the structure of traditional income support
payments and required reform. This paper uses simulated datasets to assess the
structure and incentives of the Irish COVID-19 wage subsidy scheme (CWS) under
five designs. We use a nowcasting approach to update 2017 microdata, producing
a near real time picture of the labour market at the peak of the crisis. Using
microsimulation modelling, we assess the impact of different designs on income
replacement, work incentives and income inequality. Our findings suggest that
pro rata designs support middle earners more and flat rate designs support low
earners more. We find evidence for strong work disincentives under all designs,
though flat rate designs perform better. Disincentives are primarily driven by
generous unemployment payments and work related costs. The impact of design on
income inequality depends on the generosity of payments. Earnings related pro
rata designs were associated to higher market earnings inequality. The
difference in inequality levels falls once benefits, taxes and work related
costs are considered. In our discussion, we turn to transaction costs, the
rationale for reform and reintegration of CWS. We find some support for the
claim that design changes were motivated by political considerations. We
suggest that establishing permanent wage subsidies based on sectorial turnover
rules could offer enhanced protection to middle-and high-earners and reduce
uncertainty, the need for reform, and the risk of politically motivated
designs.

at speeds comparable to DRAM. However, with caches remaining volatile,
automatic cache evictions can reorder updates to memory, potentially leaving
persistent memory in an inconsistent state upon a system crash. Flush and fence
instructions can be used to force ordering among updates, but are expensive.
This has motivated significant work studying how to write correct and efficient
persistent programs for NVRAM.
  In this paper, we present FliT, a C++ library that facilitates writing
efficient persistent code. Using the library's default mode makes any
linearizable data structure durable with minimal changes to the code. FliT
avoids many redundant flush instructions by using a novel algorithm to track
dirty cache lines. The FliT library also allows for extra optimizations, but
achieves good performance even in its default setting.
  To describe the FliT library's capabilities and guarantees, we define a
persistent programming interface, called the P-V Interface, which FliT
implements. The P-V Interface captures the expected behavior of code in which
some instructions' effects are persisted and some are not. We show that the
interface captures the desired semantics of many practical algorithms in the
literature.
  We apply the FliT library to four different persistent data structures, and
show that across several workloads, persistence implementations, and data
structure sizes, the FliT library always improves operation throughput, by at
least $2.1\times$ over a naive implementation in all but one workload.

significantly improves an earlier basic algorithm in [Vogel, Xia, et al., SIAM

techniques and provide many improvements in the algorithm design. Various
stability risks in the original algorithm are analyzed, including potential
exponential norm growth, cancellations, loss of accuracy with clustered
eigenvalues or intermediate eigenvalues, etc. In the dividing stage, we give a
new structured low-rank update strategy with balancing that eliminates the
exponential norm growth and also minimizes the ranks of low-rank updates. In
the conquering stage with low-rank updated eigenvalue solution, the original
algorithm directly uses the regular fast multipole method (FMM) to accelerate
function evaluations, which has the risks of cancellation, division by zero,
and slow convergence. Here, we design a triangular FMM to avoid cancellation.
Furthermore, when there are clustered intermediate eigenvalues or when updates
to existing eigenvalues are very small, we design a novel local shifting
strategy to integrate FMM accelerations into the solution of shifted secular
equations so as to achieve both the efficiency and the reliability. We also
provide several improvements or clarifications on some structures and
techniques that are missing or unclear in the previous work. The resulting
SuperDC eigensolver has significantly better stability while keeping the nearly
linear complexity for finding the entire eigenvalue decomposition. In a set of
comprehensive tests, SuperDC shows dramatically lower runtime and storage, and
more stability advantages than the Matlab $\textsf{eig}$ function.

Formally verifying the safety and robustness of well-trained DNNs and

is essential for safe autonomy. This research proposes a framework to repair
unsafe DNNs in safety-critical systems with reachability analysis. The repair
process is inspired by adversarial training which has demonstrated high
effectiveness in improving the safety and robustness of DNNs. Different from
traditional adversarial training approaches where adversarial examples are
utilized from random attacks and may not be representative of all unsafe
behaviors, our repair process uses reachability analysis to compute the exact
unsafe regions and identify sufficiently representative examples to enhance the
efficacy and efficiency of the adversarial training.
  The performance of our framework is evaluated on two types of benchmarks
without safe models as references. One is a DNN controller for aircraft
collision avoidance with access to training data. The other is a rocket lander
where our framework can be seamlessly integrated with the well-known deep
deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) reinforcement learning algorithm. The
experimental results show that our framework can successfully repair all
instances on multiple safety specifications with negligible performance
degradation. In addition, to increase the computational and memory efficiency
of the reachability analysis algorithm, we propose a depth-first-search
algorithm that combines an existing exact analysis method with an
over-approximation approach based on a new set representation. Experimental
results show that our method achieves a five-fold improvement in runtime and a
two-fold improvement in memory usage compared to exact analysis.

non-linear, scales. It is thus often proposed that using statistics beyond the
power spectrum can tighten constraints on the neutrino mass by extracting
additional information from these non-linear scales. We study the information
content regarding neutrino mass at the field level, quantifying how much of
this information arises from the difference in non-linear evolution between a
cosmology with 1 fluid (CDM) and 2 fluids (CDM + neutrinos). We do so by
running two $N$-body simulations, one with and one without massive neutrinos;
both with the same phases, and matching their linear power spectrum at a given,
low, redshift. This effectively isolates the information encoded in the linear
initial conditions from the non-linear cosmic evolution. We demonstrate that
for $k \lesssim 1\,h/{\rm Mpc}$, and for a single redshift, there is negligible
difference in the real-space CDM field between the two simulations. This
suggests that all the information regarding neutrino mass is in the linear
power spectrum set by the initial conditions. Thus any probe based on the CDM
field alone will have negligible constraining power beyond that which exists at
the linear level over the same range of scales. Consequently, any probe based
on the halo field will contain little information beyond the linear power. We
find similar results for the matter field responsible for weak lensing. We also
demonstrate that there may be much information beyond the power spectrum in the
3d matter field, however, this is not observable in modern surveys via dark
matter halos or weak lensing. Finally, we show that there is additional
information to be found in redshift space.

studies however indicate that ram pressure from a hot wind, driven either by
the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) or a starburst, cannot accelerate
existing cold gas to such high speeds without destroying it. In this work we
explore a different scenario, where cold gas forms in a fast, radiatively
cooling outflow with temperature $T\lesssim 10^7\,{\rm K}$. Using 3D
hydrodynamic simulations, we demonstrate that cold gas continuously fragments
out of the cooling outflow, forming elongated filamentary structures extending
tens of kiloparsecs. For a range of physically relevant temperature and
velocity configurations, a ring of cold gas perpendicular to the direction of
motion forms in the outflow. This naturally explains the formation of
transverse cold gas filaments such as the blue loop and the horseshoe filament
in the Perseus cluster. Based on our results, we estimate that the AGN outburst
responsible for the formation of these two features drove bipolar outflows with
velocity $>2,000\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$ and total kinetic energy
$>8\times10^{57}\,{\rm erg}$ about $\sim10$ Myr ago. We also examine the
continuous cooling in the mixing layer between hot and cold gas, and find that
radiative cooling only accounts for $\sim10\%$ of the total mass cooling rate,
indicating that observations of soft X-ray and FUV emission may significantly

of the weak sphaleron rate. The VIA systematically predicts a baryon asymmetry
that is orders of magnitude larger than the WKB formalism. We trace this to the
differing shapes of the $CP$-violating source terms in the two formalisms,
showing that the additional spatial derivative in the WKB source term causes
large cancellations when it is integrated over the bubble wall profile. An
important exception is a source term from $c$-$t$ quark mixing, where the WKB

the analogous $b$-$s$ mixing source is found to be orders of magnitude too
small.

evolving into moderate-mass open clusters (OC). Fast evolutionary models of
massive isolated binaries (IB) yield BBHs from binary evolution. Population
synthesis in a Model Universe is then performed, taking into account observed
cosmic star-formation and enrichment histories, to obtain BBH-merger yields
from these two channels observable at the present day and over cosmic time. The
merging BBH populations from the two channels are combined by applying a
proof-of-concept Bayesian regression chain, taking into account observed
differential intrinsic BBH merger rate densities from the second
gravitational-wave transient catalogue (GWTC-2). The analysis estimates an
OB-star binary fraction of $f_{\rm Obin}\gtrsim90$% and a YMC formation
efficiency of $f_{\rm YMC}\sim10^{-2}$, being consistent with recent optical
observations and large scale structure formation simulations. The corresponding
combined Model Universe present-day, differential intrinsic BBH merger rate
density and the cosmic evolution of BBH merger rate density both agree well
with those from GWTC-2. The analysis also suggests that despite significant
'dynamical mixing' at low redshifts, BBH mergers at high redshifts ($z_{\rm

ceased in the other 8. Most of the secondaries are hotter than any previously
known CV donors, with temperatures $4700<T_{{\rm eff}}/{\rm K}<8000$.
Remarkably, all secondaries with $T_{\rm eff} \gtrsim 7000\,\rm K$ appear to be
detached, while all cooler secondaries are still mass-transferring. This
transition likely marks the temperature where magnetic braking becomes
inefficient due to loss of the donor's convective envelope. Most of the
proto-WD secondaries have masses near $0.15\,M_{\odot}$; their companions have
masses near $0.8\,M_{\odot}$. We infer a space density of $\sim 60\,\rm
kpc^{-3}$, roughly 80 times lower than that of normal CVs and three times lower
than that of ELM WDs. The implied Galactic birth rate, $\mathcal{R}\sim 60\,\rm
Myr^{-1}$, is half that of AM CVn binaries. Most systems are well-described by
MESA models for CVs in which mass transfer begins only as the donor leaves the
main sequence. All are predicted to reach minimum periods $5\lesssim P_{\rm
orb}/{\rm min}\lesssim30$ within a Hubble time, where they will become AM CVn
binaries or merge. This sample triples the known evolved CV population and
offers broad opportunities for improving understanding of the compact binary

or projective measurements, give rise to new, intriguing quantum phenomena,
including entanglement phase transitions and unconventional conformal
invariance. Defying the complications imposed by the non-linear and stochastic
nature of the measurement process, we introduce a scenario of
measurement-induced many body evolution, which possesses an exact analytical
solution: bosonic Gaussian measurements. The evolution features a competition
between the continuous observation of linear boson operators and a free
Hamiltonian, and it is characterized by a unique and exactly solvable
covariance matrix. Within this framework, we then consider an elementary model
for quantum criticality, the free boson conformal field theory, and investigate
in which way criticality is modified under measurements. Depending on the
measurement protocol, we distinguish three fundamental scenarios (a) enriched
quantum criticality, characterized by a logarithmic entanglement growth with a
floating prefactor, or the loss of criticality, indicated by an entanglement
growth with either (b) an area-law or (c) a volume-law. For each scenario, we
discuss the impact of imperfect measurements, which reduce the purity of the
wavefunction and are equivalent to Markovian decoherence, and present a set of
observables, e.g., real-space correlations, the relaxation time, and the
entanglement structure, to classify the measurement-induced dynamics for both
pure and mixed states. Finally, we present an experimental tomography scheme,
which grants access to the density operator of the system by using the
continuous measurement record only.

show that cold dust emission alone cannot reproduce the millimeter continuum
measurements. This is evidence that the strong synchrotron emission from the
quasar contributes substantially to the emission even at millimeter

probe the effects of radio jets during the formation of a massive galaxy within

on implementing a Trotter-approximation of the time-evolution operator. This
approach typically relies on deep circuits and is therefore hampered by the
substantial limitations of available noisy and near-term quantum hardware. On
the other hand, variational quantum algorithms have become an indispensable
alternative, enabling small-scale simulations on present-day hardware. However,
despite the recent development of variational quantum algorithms for quantum
dynamics, a detailed assessment of their efficiency and scalability is yet to
be presented. To fill this gap, we applied a variational quantum algorithm
based on McLachlan's principle to simulate the dynamics of a spin-boson model
subject to varying levels of realistic hardware noise as well as in different
physical regimes, and discuss the algorithm's accuracy and scaling behavior as
a function of system size. We observe a good performance of the variational
approach used in combination with a general, physically motivated wavefunction
ansatz, and compare it to the conventional first-order Trotter-evolution.
Finally, based on this, we make scaling predictions for the simulation of a
classically intractable system. We show that, despite providing a clear
reduction of quantum gate cost, the variational method in its current
implementation is unlikely to lead to a quantum advantage for the solution of
time-dependent problems.

higher dimensions, these constraints and the divergence of density of states

region through four independent AttFastSurferCNN - a novel deep learning
architecture with a self-attention mechanism to improve modeling of contextual

exhibits high performance in terms of boundary delineation, OB localization,

dataset never encountered during training, the Human Connectome Project (HCP),
with different acquisition parameters and demographics, evaluated in 30 cases
at the native 0.7mm HCP resolution, and the default 0.8mm pipeline resolution.
We extensively validated our pipeline not only with respect to segmentation

between orbital dynamics and stellar evolution. Both stellar wind mass loss and
three-body dynamics cooperate to destabilise triples, which can lead to a
variety of astrophysical exotica. So far our understanding of their evolution
was mainly built upon results from extensive binary-single scattering
experiments. Starting from generic initial conditions, we evolve an extensive
set of hierarchical triples using a combination of the triple evolution code
TRES and an N-body code. We find that the majority of triples preserve their
hierarchy throughout their evolution, which is in contradiction with the
commonly adopted picture that unstable triples always experience a chaotic,
democratic resonant interaction. The duration of the unstable phase is much
longer than expected, so that stellar evolution cannot be neglected. Typically
an unstable triple dissolve into a single star and a binary; sometimes
democratically (the initial hierarchy is lost and the lightest body usually
escapes), but also in a hierarchical way (the tertiary is ejected in a
slingshot, independent of its mass). Collisions are common, and mostly involve
the two original inner binary components still on the main-sequence. This
contradicts the idea that collisions with a giant during democratic encounters
dominate. Together with collisions in stable triples, we find that triple
evolution is the dominant mechanism for stellar collisions in the Milky Way.
Furthermore, our simulations produce runaway and walk-away stars with speeds up
to several tens km/s, with a maximum of a few 100km/s. We suggest that
destabilised triples can alleviate the tension behind the origin of the
observed run-away stars. Lastly, we present a promising indicator to make
general predictions for the fate of a specific triple, based on the initial
inclination of the system.

sources for the space-based gravitational-wave detector LISA. Modelling these
systems requires calculating the metric perturbation due to a point particle
orbiting a Kerr black hole. Currently, the linear perturbation is obtained with
a metric reconstruction procedure that puts it in a ""no-string"" radiation gauge
which is singular on a surface surrounding the central black hole. Calculating
dynamical quantities in this gauge involves a subtle procedure of ""gauge
completion"" as well as cancellations of very large numbers. The singularities
in the gauge also lead to pathological field equations at second perturbative
order. In this paper we re-analyze the point-particle problem in Kerr using the
corrector-field reconstruction formalism of Green, Hollands, and Zimmerman
(GHZ). We clarify the relationship between the GHZ formalism and previous
reconstruction methods, showing that it provides a simple formula for the
""gauge completion"". We then use it to develop a new method of computing the
metric in a more regular gauge: a Teukolsky puncture scheme. This scheme should
ameliorate the problem of large cancellations, and by constructing the linear
metric perturbation in a sufficiently regular gauge, it should provide a first
step toward second-order self-force calculations in Kerr. Our methods are
developed in generality in Kerr, but we illustrate some key ideas and
demonstrate our puncture scheme in the simple setting of a static particle in
Minkowski spacetime.

(""noise"") and local projective measurements, each respecting a global Z_2
symmetry. The model supports a spin glass phase where the Z_2 symmetry is
spontaneously broken (not possible in an equilibrium 1d system), a paramagnetic
phase characterized by a divergent susceptibility, and an intermediate
""trivial"" phase. All three phases are also stable to Z_2-symmetric local
unitary gates, and the dynamical phase transitions between the phases are in
the percolation universality class. The open circuit dynamics can be purified
by explicitly introducing a bath with its own ""scrambling"" dynamics, as in
[Bao, Choi, Altman, arXiv:2102.09164], which does not change any of the
universal physics. Within the spin glass phase the circuit dynamics can be
interpreted as a quantum repetition code, with each stabilizer of the code
measured stochastically at a finite rate, and the decoherences as effective
bit-flip errors. Motivated by the geometry of the spin glass phase, we devise a
novel decoding algorithm for recovering an arbitrary initial qubit state in the
code space, assuming knowledge of the history of the measurement outcomes, and
the ability of performing local Pauli measurements and gates on the final
state. For a circuit with L^d qubits running for time T, the time needed to
execute the decoder scales as O(L^d T) (with dimensionality d). With this
decoder in hand, we find that the information of the initial encoded qubit
state can be retained (and then recovered) for a time logarithmic in L for a 1d
circuit, and for a time at least linear in L in 2d below a finite error
threshold. For both the repetition and toric codes, we compare and contrast our
decoding algorithm with earlier algorithms that map the error model to the
random bond Ising model.

opportunities, and social connections---increase with size. Thus, a
``successful'' online community often evokes an image of hundreds of thousands
of users, and practitioners and researchers alike have sought to devise methods
to achieve growth and thereby, success. On the other hand, small online
communities exist in droves and many persist in their smallness over time.
Turning to the highly popular discussion website Reddit, which is made up of
hundreds of thousands of communities, we conducted a qualitative interview
study examining how and why people participate in these persistently small
communities, in order to understand why these communities exist when popular
approaches would assume them to be failures. Drawing from twenty interviews,
this paper makes several contributions: we describe how small communities
provide unique informational and interactional spaces for participants, who are
drawn by the hyperspecific aspects of the community; we find that small
communities do not promote strong dyadic interpersonal relationships but rather
promote group-based identity; and we highlight how participation in small
communities is part of a broader, ongoing strategy to curate participants'
online experience. We argue that online communities can be seen as nested
niches: parts of an embedded, complex, symbiotic socio-informational ecosystem.
We suggest ways that social computing research could benefit from more
deliberate considerations of interdependence between diverse scales of online
community sizes.

of CP symmetry has ever been observed in a strongly interacting experiment.
This is known as the strong CP problem which, in its simplest manifestations,
can be quantitatively formulated via a calculation of the pion masses and the
neutron electric dipole moment. The former yields a larger mass for the neutral
pion than its charged counterparts, the latter yields a far larger result than
is experimentally measured, where in both cases the discrepancies are
parameterised by the physical quantity $\bar{\theta}$. The strong CP problem
can be solved via the inclusion of a new particle, the axion, which dynamically
sets $\bar{\theta}$ to zero, eliminating these two manifestations. Thus,
experimental searches for such a particle are an active field of research. This
dissertation acts as a review of the aforementioned concepts.

  Statistical Analysis of Pairwise Connectivity. To appear in Discovery Science
  2021",,,,"q-bio.NC cs.LG stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Analysing correlations between streams of events is an important problem. It
arises for example in Neurosciences, when the connectivity of neurons should be
inferred from spike trains that record neurons' individual spiking activity.
While recently some approaches for inferring delayed synaptic connections have
been proposed, they are limited in the types of connectivities and delays they
are able to handle, or require computation-intensive procedures. This paper
proposes a faster and more flexible approach for analysing such delayed
correlated activity: a statistical approach for the Analysis of Connectivity in
spiking Events (ACE), based on the idea of hypothesis testing. It first
computes for any pair of a source and a target neuron the inter-spike delays
between subsequent source- and target-spikes. Then, it derives a null model for
the distribution of inter-spike delays for \emph{uncorrelated}~neurons.
Finally, it compares the observed distribution of inter-spike delays to this
null model and infers pairwise connectivity based on the Pearson's Chi-squared
test statistic. Thus, ACE is capable to detect connections with a priori
unknown, non-discrete (and potentially large) inter-spike delays, which might
vary between pairs of neurons. Since ACE works incrementally, it has potential
for being used in online processing. In our experiments, we visualise the
advantages of ACE in varying experimental scenarios (except for one special
case) and in a state-of-the-art dataset which has been generated for
neuro-scientific research under most realistic conditions.

providing a viable pathway to prepare bulk forms of transition-metal io-dates.
Rietveld refinements of the powder synchrotron X-ray diffraction data reveal
that these materials exhibit different crystal structures but crystallize in
the same polar and chiral P21 space group, giving rise to an electric
polarization along the b-axis direction. The presence and absence of an evident
phase transition to a possible topologically distinct state observed in
Cu(IO3)2 and Mn(IO3)2, respectively, implies the important role of spin-orbit
coupling. Neutron diffraction experiments reveal helpful insights into the
magnetic ground state of these materials. While the long-wavelength
incommensurability of Cu(IO3)2 is in harmony with orbital effects and
anisotropic magnetic exchange, the commensurate stripe AFM ground state of
Mn(IO3)2 is attributed to quenched orbital angular momentum and isotropic
magnetic coupling. The work demonstrates connections between combined spin and

worthwhile approach for tuning asymmetric interaction which promotes evolution
of topologically distinct spin phases.

to learn fine-grained audiovisual patterns that trigger cuts. To do this, we
first collected a data source of more than 10K videos, from which we extract
more than 255K cuts. We devise a model that learns to discriminate between real

baselines to benchmark video cut generation. We observe that our proposed model
outperforms the baselines by large margins. To demonstrate our model in
real-world applications, we conduct human studies in a collection of unedited
videos. The results show that our model does a better job at cutting than
random and alternative baselines.

of the Milky Way (MW), using archival ultraviolet spectra of background quasars
from the Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph. We co-add spectra
of different background sources at close projected angular separation on the
sky. This novel stacking technique dramatically increases the signal-to-noise
ratio of the spectra, allowing detection of low column density gas (down to
$EW$ > 2 mA). We identify absorption as inflowing or outflowing, by using
blue/redshifted high velocity cloud (HVC) absorption components in the
Galactocentric rest frame, respectively. The mass surface densities of
inflowing and outflowing gas both vary by more than an order of magnitude
across the sky, with mean values of $\langle \Sigma_{in}\rangle \gtrsim
10^{4.6\pm0.1}$ $M_{\odot}\,\mathrm{kpc}^{-2}$ for inflowing gas and $\langle
\Sigma_{out}\rangle \gtrsim 10^{3.5\pm 0.1}$ $M_{\odot}\,\mathrm{kpc}^{-2}$ for
outflowing gas, respectively. The mass flow rate surface densities (mass flow
rates per unit area) also show large variation across the sky with $\langle

are clustered at smaller angular scales ($\theta < 40^\circ$). This indicates
that most of the mass in inflowing gas is confined to small, well-defined

allowing a lossless analysis of composition, post-processing, and privacy
amplification via subsampling. In the setting of $f$-DP, we propose the concept
of a canonical noise distribution (CND), the first mechanism designed for an
arbitrary $f$-DP guarantee. The notion of CND captures whether an additive
privacy mechanism perfectly matches the privacy guarantee of a given $f$. We
prove that a CND always exists, and give a construction that produces a CND for
any $f$. We show that private hypothesis tests are intimately related to CNDs,
allowing for the release of private $p$-values at no additional privacy cost as
well as the construction of uniformly most powerful (UMP) tests for binary
data, within the general $f$-DP framework.
  We apply our techniques to the problem of difference of proportions testing,
and construct a UMP unbiased (UMPU) ""semi-private"" test which upper bounds the
performance of any $f$-DP test. Using this as a benchmark we propose a private
test, based on the inversion of characteristic functions, which allows for
optimal inference for the two population parameters and is nearly as powerful
as the semi-private UMPU. When specialized to the case of $(\epsilon,0)$-DP, we
show empirically that our proposed test is more powerful than any
$(\epsilon/\sqrt 2)$-DP test and has more accurate type I errors than the
classic normal approximation test.

large fraction of CV binaries merge as a result of unstable mass transfer.
Tidal disruption of the secondary forms a geometrically thick disk around the
WD, which subsequently accretes at highly super-Eddington rates. Analytic
estimates and numerical hydrodynamical simulations reveal that outflows from
the accretion flow unbind a large fraction >~ 90% of the secondary at
velocities ~500-1000 km/s within days of the merger. Hydrogen recombination in
the expanding ejecta powers optical transient emission lasting about a month
with a luminosity > 1e38 erg/s, similar to slow classical novae and luminous
red novae from ordinary stellar mergers. Over longer timescales the mass
accreted by the WD undergoes hydrogen shell burning, inflating the remnant into
a giant of luminosity ~300-5000 L_sun, effective temperature T_eff ~ 3000 K and
lifetime ~1e4-1e5 yr. We predict that ~1e3-1e4 Milky Way giants are CV merger
products, potentially distinguishable by atypical surface abundances. We
explore whether any Galactic historical slow classical novae are masquerading
CV mergers by identifying four such post-nova systems with potential giant
counterparts for which a CV merger origin cannot be ruled out. We address
whether the historical transient CK Vul and its gaseous/dusty nebula resulted

stems from the fact that this high-dimensional threshold model is nonregular

deal with these challenges, we construct a test statistic via a new
bias-corrected smoothed decorrelated score approach, and establish its
asymptotic distributions under both null and local alternative hypotheses. We
propose a double-smoothing approach to select the optimal bandwidth in our test
statistic and provide theoretical guarantees for the selected bandwidth. We
conduct simulation studies to demonstrate how our proposed procedure can be

BV-invariance manifest. This is achieved using a version of homotopy transfer
resulting in a non-polynomial action for which the quantum master equation is
now well defined and will be satisfied by adding additional vertices at loop

and time-consuming tasks. In this paper, we propose a visualized malware
classification framework called VisMal, which provides highly efficient
categorization with acceptable accuracy. VisMal converts malware samples into
images and then applies a contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization
algorithm to enhance the similarity between malware image regions in the same

extensive evaluation to verify the performance of our framework. The evaluation
results indicate that VisMal can classify a malware sample within 4.0ms and

large-scale MISR using multi-GPU acceleration named FL-MISR. The scaled
conjugate gradient (SCG) algorithm is applied to the distributed subfunctions
and the local SCG variables are communicated to synchronize the convergence
rate over multi-GPU systems towards a consistent convergence. Furthermore, an
inner-outer border exchange scheme is performed to obviate the border effect
between neighboring GPUs. The proposed FL-MISR is applied to the computed

detector shift. The SR reconstruction is performed on the fly during the CT
acquisition such that no additional computation time is introduced. FL-MISR is
extensively evaluated from different aspects and experimental results
demonstrate that FL-MISR effectively improves the spatial resolution of CT

to a multi-core CPU implementation, FL-MISR achieves a more than 50x speedup on

learning. An ideal platform for implementing them are low- or
zero-energy-barrier nanomagnets (LBMs) possessing in-plane anisotropy (e.g.
circular or slightly elliptical disks) whose fluctuating magnetization encodes
a probabilistic (p-) bit. Here, we show that such a BSN's activation function,
the pinning current (which pins the output to a particular binary state), and
the response time - all exhibit strong sensitivity to very slight geometric
variations in the LBM's cross section. A mere 1% change in the diameter of a
circular nanomagnet in any arbitrary direction can alter the response time by a
factor of ~4 at room temperature and a 10% change can alter the pinning current
by a factor of ~2. All this causes large device-to-device variation which is
detrimental to integration.
  We also show that the energy dissipation is lowered but the response time is
increased by replacing a circular cross-section with a slightly elliptical one
and then encoding the p-bit in the magnetization component along the major
axis. Encoding the p-bit in the magnetization component along the minor axis
has the opposite effect. The energy-delay-product, however, is relatively
independent of whether the cross-section is a circle or an ellipse and which
magnetization component encodes the p-bit in the case of the ellipse.

single face image of an arbitrary person as input. In contrast to previous
text-driven talking head generation methods, which can only synthesize the
voice of a specific person, the proposed method is capable of synthesizing
speech for any person that is inaccessible in the training stage. Specifically,
the proposed method decomposes the generation of synchronized speech and
talking head videos into two stages, i.e., a text-to-speech (TTS) stage and a
speech-driven talking head generation stage. The proposed TTS module is a
face-conditioned multi-speaker TTS model that gets the speaker identity
information from face images instead of speech, which allows us to synthesize a
personalized voice on the basis of the input face image. To generate the
talking head videos from the face images, a facial landmark-based method that
can predict both lip movements and head rotations is proposed. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is able to generate
synchronized speech and talking head videos for arbitrary persons and
non-persons. Synthesized speech shows consistency with the given face regarding
to the synthesized voice's timbre and one's appearance in the image, and the
proposed landmark-based talking head method outperforms the state-of-the-art
landmark-based method on generating natural talking head videos.

multi-objective optimization problems that are given by polynomial functions.
First, we study the convex geometry for (weakly) Pareto values and give a
convex representation for them. Linear scalarization problems (LSPs) and
Chebyshev scalarization problems (CSPs) are typical approaches for getting
(weakly) Pareto points. For LSPs, we show how to use tight relaxations to solve

show how to solve them by moment relaxations. Moreover, we show how to check if
a given point is a (weakly) Pareto point or not and how to detect existence or

unboundedness of polynomial optimization, which is used to detect nonexistence

ensuring robustness, fast and scalable data processing. However, most papers
dealing with the lambda architecture are focusing one single type of data

is significant, contradicting usual assumptions. Per fission event, in our
simulations, the neutron and statistical $\gamma$-ray emissions change the spin
of the fragment by 3.5 -- 5~$\hbar$, with a large standard deviation comparable
to the average value. Such wide angular momentum removal distributions can hide
any underlying correlations in the fission fragment initial spin values. Within
our model, we reproduce data on spin measurements from discrete transitions
after neutron emissions, especially in the case of light FFs. The agreement
further improves for the heavy fragments if one removes from the analysis the
events that would produce isomeric states. Finally, we show that while in our
model the initial FF spins do not follow a saw-tooth like behavior observed in
recent measurements, the average FF spin computed after neutron and statistical

that the average FF spin measured after statistical emissions is not

more generalized transformation. Finally, we discuss interpretation degeneracy

elegant arches of glowing plasma that trace the corona's magnetic field.
Typically, these loops are preferentially illuminated segments of an arcade of
vaulted field lines and such loops are often observed to sway in response to
nearby solar flares. A flurry of observational and theoretical effort has been
devoted to the exploitation of these oscillations with the grand hope that
seismic techniques might be used as probes of the strength and structure of the
corona's magnetic field. The commonly accepted viewpoint is that each visible
loop oscillates as an independent entity and acts as a one-dimensional (1D)
wave cavity for magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) kink waves. We argue that for many
events, this generally accepted model for the wave cavity is fundamentally
flawed. In particular, the 3D magnetic arcade in which the bright loop resides
participates in the oscillation. Thus, the true wave cavity is larger than the
individual loop and inherently multidimensional. We derive the skin depth of
the near-field response for an oscillating loop and demonstrate that most loops
are too close to other magnetic structures to oscillate in isolation. Further,
we present a simple model of a loop embedded within an arcade and explore how
the eigenmodes of the arcade and the eigenmodes of the loop become coupled. In
particular, we discuss how distinguishing between these two types of modes can
be difficult when the motions within the arcade are often invisible.

that by monitoring packet trajectories, malicious participants cannot

CNT bundle extensions in certain directions were summarized algebraically and
expressed as visible barcodes. The barcodes were then calculated and converted
into the total spread function $V(X,\theta)$, from which the alignment fraction
and the preferred direction could be determined. For validation purposes, the
random CNT sheets were mechanically stretched at various strain ratios ranging
from $0-40\%$, and quantitative TDA analysis was conducted based on the SEM
images taken at random positions. The results showed high consistency
($R^2=0.975$) compared to the Herman's orientation factors derived from the
polarized Raman spectroscopy and wide-angle X-ray scattering analysis.
Additionally, the TDA method presented great robustness with varying SEM
acceleration voltages and magnifications, which might alter the scope in
alignment detection. With potential applications in nanofiber systems, this
study offers a rapid and simple way to quantify CNT alignment, which plays a
crucial role in transferring the CNT properties into engineering products.

unbiasedness and accuracy - and not generalizability. We propose a simple
definition for the External Validity (EV) of interventions and counterfactuals.
The definition leads to EV statistics for individual counterfactuals, and to
non-parametric effect estimators for sets of counterfactuals (i.e., for
samples). We use this definition to discuss several issues that have baffled
the original counterfactual formulation: out-of-sample validity, reliance on
independence assumptions or estimation, concurrent estimation of multiple
effects and full-models, bias-variance tradeoffs, statistical power, omitted
variables, and connections to current predictive and explaining techniques.
  Methodologically, the definition also allows us to replace the parametric,
and generally ill-posed, estimation problems that followed the counterfactual
definition by combinatorial enumeration problems in non-experimental samples.
We use this framework to generalize popular supervised, explaining, and
causal-effect estimators, improving their performance across three dimensions
(External Validity, Unconfoundness and Accuracy), and enabling their use in
non-i.i.d. samples. We demonstrate gains in out-of-sample prediction,
intervention effect prediction, and causal effect estimation tasks. The COVID19
pandemic highlighted the need for learning solutions to provide general
predictions in small samples - many times with missing variables. We also

applications. There has been much research on architectures without CNN and
self-attention in this context. In particular, MLP-Mixer is a simple
architecture designed using MLPs and hit an accuracy comparable to the Vision
Transformer. However, the only inductive bias in this architecture is the
embedding of tokens. This leaves open the possibility of incorporating a
non-convolutional (or non-local) inductive bias into the architecture, so we
used two simple ideas to incorporate inductive bias into the MLP-Mixer while
taking advantage of its ability to capture global correlations. A way is to
divide the token-mixing block vertically and horizontally. Another way is to
make spatial correlations denser among some channels of token-mixing. With this
approach, we were able to improve the accuracy of the MLP-Mixer while reducing
its parameters and computational complexity. The small model that is RaftMLP-S
is comparable to the state-of-the-art global MLP-based model in terms of

However, it did not have significant performance and mentioned the need for
MLP-specific architectures for downstream tasks for global MLP-based models.

of physically motivated toy models to compare with and interpret the observed
features in the TPCFs. We find that, conforming to earlier studies, young
clusters ($T \la 10\, \mathrm{Myr}$) have power-law TPCFs that are
characteristic of fractal distributions with a fractal dimension $D_2$, and
this scale-free nature extends out to a maximum scale $l_{\mathrm{corr}}$
beyond which the distribution becomes Poissonian. However, $l_{\mathrm{corr}}$,
and $D_2$ vary significantly across the sample, and are correlated with a
number of host galaxy physical properties, suggesting that there are physical
differences in the underlying star cluster distributions. We also find that
hierarchical structuring weakens with age, evidenced by flatter TPCFs for older
clusters ($T \ga 10\, \mathrm{Myr}$), that eventually converges to the residual
correlation expected from a completely random large-scale radial distribution
of clusters in the galaxy in $\sim 100 \, \mathrm{Myr}$. Our study demonstrates
that the hierarchical distribution of star clusters evolves with age, and is
strongly dependent on the properties of the host galaxy environment.

Compatibility-driven web APIs Recommendation approach, namely DivCAR, is put
forward in this paper. First, to achieve diversity, DivCAR employs random walk
sampling technique on a pre-built correlation graph to generate diverse
correlation subgraphs. Afterwards, with the diverse correlation subgraphs, we
model the compatible web APIs recommendation problem to be a minimum group
Steiner tree search problem. Through solving the minimum group Steiner tree
search problem, manifold sets of compatible and diverse web APIs ranked are
returned to the app developers. At last, we design and enact a set of

Experimental results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed

Architecture Search (NAS) methods for its search efficiency and simplicity,
accomplished by jointly optimizing the model weight and architecture parameters

search phase, the operations with the largest architecture parameters will be
selected to form the final architecture, with the implicit assumption that the

has been discussed about the supernet's optimization, the architecture
selection process has received little attention. We provide empirical and
theoretical analysis to show that the magnitude of architecture parameters does
not necessarily indicate how much the operation contributes to the supernet's

selection that directly measures each operation's influence on the supernet. We
re-evaluate several differentiable NAS methods with the proposed architecture

architectures from the underlying supernets consistently. Furthermore, we find
that several failure modes of DARTS can be greatly alleviated with the proposed

treatment effects in observational studies, but extreme propensity scores could
bias the estimator and induce excessive variance. Recently, the overlap
weighting approach has been proposed to alleviate this problem, which smoothly
down-weighs the subjects with extreme propensity scores. Although advantages of
overlap weighting have been extensively demonstrated in literature with
continuous and binary outcomes, research on its performance with time-to-event
or survival outcomes is limited. In this article, we propose two weighting
estimators that combine propensity score weighting and inverse probability of
censoring weighting to estimate the counterfactual survival functions. These
estimators are applicable to the general class of balancing weights, which
includes inverse probability weighting, trimming, and overlap weighting as
special cases. We conduct simulations to examine the empirical performance of
these estimators with different weighting schemes in terms of bias, variance,
and 95% confidence interval coverage, under various degree of covariate overlap
between treatment groups and censoring rate. We demonstrate that overlap
weighting consistently outperforms inverse probability weighting and associated
trimming methods in bias, variance, and coverage for time-to-event outcomes,
and the advantages increase as the degree of covariate overlap between the
treatment groups decreases.

Observations from these networks cover the bright flight, where the meteoroid

often be predicted forward in time to the ground to estimate an impact
position. This darkflight modelling is deceptively simple, but there is hidden
complexity covering the precise interactions between the meteorite and the
(usually active) atmosphere. We describe the method and approach used by the
Desert Fireball Network, detailing the issues we have addressed, and the impact
that factors such as shape, mass and density have on the predicted fall
position. We illustrate this with a case study of Murrili meteorite fall that
occurred into Lake Eyre-Kati Thanda in 2015. The fall was very well observed
from multiple viewpoints, and the trajectory was steep, with a low altitude
endpoint, such that the darkflight was relatively short. Murrili is 1.68 kg
with a typical ordinary chondrite density, but with a somewhat flattened shape
compared to a sphere, such that there are discrepancies between sphere-based
predictions and the actual recovery location. It is notable that even in this
relatively idealised darkflight scenario, modelling using spherical shaped
projectiles resulted in a significant distance between predicted fall position
and recovered meteorite.

the nonminimal coupling interaction between gravity and the electromagnetic
field in the general quadric corrected Einstein-Maxwell gravity can
sufficiently influence the expression of the Wald entropy, we check whether the
Wald entropy of black holes in the quadric corrected gravity still satisfies
the second law. A quasistationary accreting process of black holes is first
considered, which describes that black holes are perturbed by matter fields and
eventually settle down to a stationary state. Two assumptions that the matter
fields should obey the null energy condition and that a regular bifurcation
surface exists on the background spacetime are further proposed. According to
the two assumptions and the Raychaudhuri equation, we demonstrate that the Wald

of levitated sensors is a key requirement to sufficiently reduce background

first stage is driven by Starobinsky's scalaron coming from the $R^2$ gravity,
and whose second stage is driven by another scalar belonging to the
supergravity multiplet. The ultra-slow-roll regime between the two stages leads
a large peak (enhancement) in the power spectrum of scalar perturbations, which
results in efficient PBH formation. Both inflation and PBH formation are
generic in our models, while those PBH can account for a significant part or
the whole of dark matter. Some of the earlier proposed models in the same class
are in tension (over $3\sigma$) with the observed value of the scalar tilt
$n_s$, so that we study more general models with more parameters, and
investigate the dependence of the cosmological tilts $(n_s,r)$ and the scalar
power spectrum enhancement upon the parameters. The PBH masses and their
density fraction (as part of dark matter) are also calculated. A good agreement
(between $2\sigma$ and $3\sigma$) with the observed value of $n_s$ requires
fine tuning of the parameters, and it is only realized in the so-called

PBH and dark matter together, and may be confirmed or falsified by future
precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation and

pre-pilot observations of two `dark' HI sources (with HI masses of a few times
10^8 Msol and no known stellar counterpart) that reside within 363 kpc of NGC
1395, the most massive early-type galaxy in the Eridanus group of galaxies. We
investigate whether these `dark' HI sources have resulted from past tidal
interactions or whether they are an extreme class of low surface brightness
galaxies. Our results suggest that both scenarios are possible, and not
mutually exclusive. The two `dark' HI sources are compact, reside in relative
isolation and are more than 159 kpc away from their nearest HI-rich galaxy
neighbour. Regardless of origin, the HI sizes and masses of both `dark' HI
sources are consistent with the HI size-mass relationship that is found in
nearby low-mass galaxies, supporting the possibility that these HI sources are
an extreme class of low surface brightness galaxies. We identified three
analogues of candidate primordial `dark' HI galaxies within the TNG100

matter-dominated, have assembled most of their mass 12-13 Gyr ago, and have not

specific angular momentum - baryonic mass ($j_{\mathrm{b}} - M_{\mathrm{b}}$)
relation for the Eridanus galaxies is observed to be an unbroken power law of
the form $j_{\mathrm{b}} \propto M_{\mathrm{b}}^{0.57 \pm 0.05}$, with a
scatter of $\sim 0.10 \pm 0.01$ dex, consistent with previous works. We examine
the relation between the atomic gas fraction, $f_{\mathrm{atm}}$, and the

knowledge-based fake news detection, an external knowledge graph is often
required, which may introduce additional problems: it is quite common for

improving the performance of this model through a simple but effective

and trace the chemical reactions and transport following the photodissociation
of H2O, CH4, NH3, and H2S, with K2-18 b, PH2 b, and Kepler-167 e representing
temperate/cold planets around M and G/K stars. We find that NH3 is likely
depleted by photodissociation to the cloud deck on planets around G/K stars but
remains intact in the middle atmosphere of planets around M stars. A common
phenomenon on temperate planets is that the photodissociation of NH3 in
presence of CH4 results in HCN as the main photochemical product. The
photodissociation of CH4 together with H2O leads to CO and CO2, and the
synthesis of hydrocarbon is suppressed. Temperate planets with super-solar
atmospheric metallicity and appreciable internal heat may have additional CO
and CO2 from the interior and less NH3 and thus less HCN. Our models of K2-18 b
can explain the transmission spectrum measured by Hubble, and indicate that
future observations in 0.5-5.0 um would provide the sensitivity to detect the
equilibrium gases CH4, H2O, and NH3, the photochemical gas HCN, as well as CO2
in some cases. Temperate and H2-rich exoplanets are thus laboratories of
atmospheric chemistry that operate in regimes not found in the Solar System,

classification, but their practical application is bottlenecked by the need for
large labeled training datasets. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) approaches
leverage small labeled datasets alongside larger unlabeled datasets and offer
potential for reducing labeling cost. In this work, we introduce NoTeacher, a
novel consistency-based SSL framework which incorporates probabilistic
graphical models. Unlike Mean Teacher which maintains a teacher network updated
via a temporal ensemble, NoTeacher employs two independent networks, thereby
eliminating the need for a teacher network. We demonstrate how NoTeacher can be

Specifically, we describe adaptations for scenarios with 2D and 3D inputs, uni

on three public benchmark datasets spanning the workhorse modalities of
radiology (X-Ray, CT, MRI), we show that NoTeacher achieves over 90-95% of the

without explicitly indicating the corrupted regions in a face image.
Inherently, this task faces two challenges: (1) how to detect various mask
patterns of different shapes and contents; (2) how to restore visually
plausible and pleasing contents in the masked regions. In this paper, we
propose a novel two-stage blind face inpainting method named Frequency-guided
Transformer and Top-Down Refinement Network (FT-TDR) to tackle these
challenges. Specifically, we first use a transformer-based network to detect
the corrupted regions to be inpainted as masks by modeling the relation among
different patches. We also exploit the frequency modality as complementary
information for improved detection results and capture the local contextual
incoherence to enhance boundary consistency. Then a top-down refinement network
is proposed to hierarchically restore features at different levels and generate
contents that are semantically consistent with the unmasked face regions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms current
state-of-the-art blind and non-blind face inpainting methods qualitatively and
quantitatively.

asymmetric control of light. Here we demonstrate asymmetric parametric
generation of light in nonlinear metasurfaces. We assemble dissimilar nonlinear
dielectric resonators into translucent metasurfaces that produce images in the
visible spectral range being illuminated by infrared radiation. By design, the
metasurfaces produce different and completely independent images for the
reversed direction of illumination, that is when the positions of the infrared

asymmetric control of light by subwavelength resonators paves the way towards
novel nanophotonic components via dense integration of large quantities of

screening crucial for detection and treatment. In recent years, a new form of

current standard MRI techniques (T2-weighted (T2w) imaging, diffusion-weighted

important problem with broad applications across many disciplines. However,
previous works with theoretical guarantee typically assume restrictive
incoherence conditions on the basis vectors for the CP components. In this
paper, we propose new computationally efficient composite PCA and concurrent
orthogonalization algorithms for tensor CP decomposition with theoretical
guarantees under mild incoherence conditions. The composite PCA applies the
principal component or singular value decompositions twice, first to a matrix
unfolding of the tensor data to obtain singular vectors and then to the matrix
folding of the singular vectors obtained in the first step. It can be used as
an initialization for any iterative optimization schemes for the tensor CP
decomposition. The concurrent orthogonalization algorithm iteratively estimates
the basis vector in each mode of the tensor by simultaneously applying
projections to the orthogonal complements of the spaces generated by other CP
components in other modes. It is designed to improve the alternating least
squares estimator and other forms of the high order orthogonal iteration for
tensors with low or moderately high CP ranks, and it is guaranteed to converge
rapidly when the error of any given initial estimator is bounded by a small
constant. Our theoretical investigation provides estimation accuracy and
convergence rates for the two proposed algorithms. Both proposed algorithms are
applicable to deterministic tensor, its noisy version, and the order-$2K$

(DNNs), recent advances on KT have increasingly concentrated on exploring DNNs
to improve the performance of KT. However, we empirically reveal that the DNNs
based KT models may run the risk of overfitting, especially on small datasets,
leading to limited generalization. In this paper, by leveraging the current
advances in adversarial training (AT), we propose an efficient AT based KT
method (ATKT) to enhance KT model's generalization and thus push the limit of
KT. Specifically, we first construct adversarial perturbations and add them on
the original interaction embeddings as adversarial examples. The original and
adversarial examples are further used to jointly train the KT model, forcing it
is not only to be robust to the adversarial examples, but also to enhance the
generalization over the original ones. To better implement AT, we then present
an efficient attentive-LSTM model as KT backbone, where the key is a proposed
knowledge hidden state attention module that adaptively aggregates information
from previous knowledge hidden states while simultaneously highlighting the
importance of current knowledge hidden state to make a more accurate
prediction. Extensive experiments on four public benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our ATKT achieves new state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at:

to $V\sim 30$ mag$\,$arcsec$^{-2}$ and a projected radius of $16.5$ kpc. This
indicates that NGC 6822 has not experienced any recent interaction with a
companion galaxy, despite previous suggestions to the contrary. Similarly, we
find no evidence for any dwarf satellites of NGC 6822 to a limiting luminosity
$M_V\approx -5$. NGC 6822 contains a disk of HI gas and young stars, oriented
at $\sim 60$ degrees to an extended spheroid composed of old stellar
populations. We observe no correlation between the distribution of young stars
and spheroid members. Our imaging allows us to trace the spheroid to nearly
$11$ kpc along its major axis, commensurate with the extent of the NGC 6822
globular cluster system. We find that the spheroid becomes increasingly
flattened at larger radii, and its position angle twists by up to $40$ degrees.
We use Gaia EDR3 astrometry to measure a proper motion for NGC 6822, and then
sample its orbital parameter space. While this galaxy has spent the majority of
its life in isolation, we find that it likely passed within the virial radius
of the Milky Way $\sim3-4$ Gyr ago. This may explain the apparent flattening

methods are designed for the closed-set scenario where the set of devices is
remains unchanged. These methods can not be generalized to the RFF
discrimination of unknown devices. To enable the discrimination of RFF from
both known and unknown devices, we propose a new end-to-end deep learning
framework for extracting RFFs from raw received signals. The proposed framework
comprises a novel preprocessing module, called neural synchronization~(NS),
which incorporates the data-driven learning with signal processing priors as an
inductive bias from communication-model based processing. Compared to
traditional carrier synchronization techniques, which are static, this module
estimates offsets by two learnable deep neural networks jointly trained by the
RFF extractor. Additionally, a hypersphere representation is proposed to
further improve the discrimination of RFF. Theoretical analysis shows that such
a data-and-model framework can better optimize the mutual information between
device identity and the RFF, which naturally leads to better performance.
Experimental results verify that the proposed RFF significantly outperforms
purely data-driven DNN-design and existing handcrafted RFF methods in terms of
both discrimination and network generalizability.

debiased lasso in two important aspects. First, in computing the estimate at
the current stage, it only uses summary statistics of the historical data.
Second, in addition to debiasing an online lasso estimator, ODL corrects an
approximation error term arising from nonlinear online updating with streaming
data. We show that the proposed online debiased estimators for the GLMs are
consistent and asymptotically normal. This result provides a theoretical basis
for carrying out real-time interim statistical inference with streaming data.
Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of
the proposed ODL method. These experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our

spintronic devices is the small signal read-out owing to the limited
anisotropic magnetoresistance in antiferromagnets. However, this could be
overcome by either utilizing the Berry-curvature-induced anomalous Hall
resistance in noncollinear antiferromagnets or establishing tunnel junction
devices based on effective manipulation of antiferromagnetic spins. In this
work, we demonstrate the giant piezoelectric strain control of the spin
structure and the anomalous Hall resistance in a noncollinear antiferromagnetic
metal - D019 hexagonal Mn3Ga. Furthermore, we built tunnel junction devices
with a diameter of 200 nm to amplify the maximum tunneling resistance ratio to
more than 10% at room-temperature, which thus implies significant potential of
noncollinear antiferromagnets for large signal-output and high-density
antiferromagnetic spintronic device applications.

Point Deconvolution (SPD) to generate the complete point clouds. The
SnowflakeNet models the generation of complete point clouds as the

insight of revealing detailed geometry is to introduce skip-transformer in SPD
to learn point splitting patterns which can fit local regions the best.
Skip-transformer leverages attention mechanism to summarize the splitting
patterns used in the previous SPD layer to produce the splitting in the current
SPD layer. The locally compact and structured point cloud generated by SPD is
able to precisely capture the structure characteristic of 3D shape in local
patches, which enables the network to predict highly detailed geometries, such

ever rising data rate can be met with the increment of the number of antennas.
This comes at the price of energy consumption of higher amount, complex network
setups and maintenance. Moreover a high-velocity user experiences unpredictable
fluctuations in the channel condition that deteriorates the downlink
performance. Therefore a proper number of antenna selection is of paramount
importance. This issue has been addressed using different categories of
algorithms but only for static users. In this study we proffer to implement
antenna diversity in closed loop spatial multiplexing MIMO transmission scheme
by operating more number of reception antennas than the number of transmission
antennas for ameliorating the downlink performance of high-velocity users in

area and volume (integrated precipitation), implying a lack of characteristic
scale in tropical convective organization. However, it remains unknown what
gives rise to the power laws and how the power-law exponents for area and
volume are related to one another. Here, we explore the perspective that
precipitation clusters are islands above a convective threshold on a rough
column-water-vapor (CWV) topography. This perspective is supported by the
agreement between the precipitation clusters and CWV islands in their frequency
distributions as well as fractal dimensions. Power laws exist for CWV islands
at different thresholds through the CWV topography, suggesting that the
existence of power-laws is not specifically related to local precipitation
dynamics, but is rather a general feature of CWV islands. Furthermore, the
frequency distributions and fractal dimensions of the clusters can be
reproduced when the CWV field is modeled to be self-affine with a roughness
exponent of 0.3. Self-affine scaling theory relates the statistics of
precipitation clusters to the roughness exponent; it also relates the power-law
slopes for area and volume without involving the roughness exponent. Thus, the
perspective of precipitation clusters as CWV islands provides a useful
framework to consider many statistical properties of the precipitation
clusters, particularly given that CWV is well-observed over a wide range of
length scales in the tropics. However, the statistics of CWV islands at the
convective threshold imply a smaller roughness than is inferred from the power
spectrum of the bulk CWV field, and further work is needed to understand the
scaling of the CWV field.

Additionally, by combining these structural parameters with scaling relations

that ~40 % of the objects in our sample are classified as pseudobulges, which
are found preferentially in LTGs. Also, our findings confirm trends reported

Demand-Driven Services (DDS) into urban lives, including ridesharing, on-demand

Dispatching, which is to form service loops from demand/supply distributions,
and 2)Routing, which is to decide specific serving orders within the
constructed loops. Generating high-quality strategies in both stages is
important to develop DDS but faces several challenging. Meanwhile, deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) has been developed rapidly in recent years. It is
a powerful tool to solve these problems since DRL can learn a parametric model
without relying on too many problem-based assumptions and optimize long-term

then highlight common applications and important decision/control problems
within. For each problem, we comprehensively introduce the existing DRL

improved greatly by taking user behavior sequence into consideration,

months. Though there are numerous works focus on modeling sequential user
behaviors, few works can handle long-term user behavior sequence due to the
strict inference time constraint in real world system. Two-stage methods are
proposed to push the limit for better performance. At the first stage, an
auxiliary task is designed to retrieve the top-$k$ similar items from long-term
user behavior sequence. At the second stage, the classical attention mechanism
is conducted between the candidate item and $k$ items selected in the first
stage. However, information gap happens between retrieval stage and the main
CTR task. This goal divergence can greatly diminishing the performance gain of

metal-poor domain explored here proves tremendously sensitive to the initial
mass of the star. M<2Msun stars experience several third dredge-up events,
which favour the gradual surface enrichment of C12 and the formation of
significant quantities of carbonaceous dust, of the order of 0.01Msun. The C13
and nitrogen yiel are found to be significantly smaller than in previous
explorations of low-mass, metal-poor AGB stars, owing to the weaker proton
ingestion episodes experienced during the initial AGB phases. M>5Msun stars
experience hot bottom burning and their surface chemistry reflects the
equilibria of a very advanced proton-capture nucleosynthesis; little dust
production takes place in their wind. Intermediate mass stars experience both
third dredge-up and hot bottom burning: they prove efficient producers of
nitrogen, which is formed by proton captures on C12 nuclei of primary origin

molecular Prandtl numbers, $Pr$, as low as $10^{-6}$, under conditions that are
far from satisfying the Oberbeck-Boussinesq (OB) idealization. The effects of
these extreme circumstances on turbulent heat transport are unknown, and no
comparable conditions exist on Earth. Our goal is to understand how these
effects scale (since we cannot yet replicate the Sun's conditions faithfully).
We study thermal convection by using direct numerical simulations, and
determine the variation with respect to $Pr$, to values as low as $10^{-4}$, of
the turbulent Prandtl number, $Pr_t$, which is the ratio of turbulent viscosity
to thermal diffusivity. The simulations are primarily two-dimensional but we
draw upon some three-dimensional results as well. We focus on
non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq (NOB) conditions of a certain type, but also study OB
convection for comparison. The OB simulations are performed in a rectangular
box of aspect ratio 2 by varying $Pr$ from $O(10)$ to $10^{-4}$ at fixed
Grashof number $Gr \equiv Ra/Pr = 10^9$. The NOB simulations are done in the
same box by letting only the thermal diffusivity depend on the temperature.
Here, the Rayleigh number is fixed at the top boundary while the mean $Pr$
varies in the bulk from 0.07 to $5 \times 10^{-4}$. The three-dimensional
simulations are performed in a box of aspect ratio 25 at a fixed Rayleigh
number of $10^5$, and $0.005 \leq Pr \leq 7$. The principal finding is that
$Pr_t$ increases with decreasing $Pr$ in both OB and NOB convection: $Pr_t \sim
Pr^{-0.3}$ for OB convection and $Pr_t \sim Pr^{-1}$ for the NOB case. The
$Pr_t$-dependence for the NOB case especially suggests that convective flows in
the astrophysical settings behave effectively as in high-Prandtl-number
turbulence.

properties of Fe5O6 calculated by the density functional theory plus dynamic

a conductor at the ambient pressure with dominant Fe-3d density of states at
the Fermi level. The magnetic moments of iron atoms at three non-equivalent
crystallographic sites in Fe5O6 collapse at significantly different rate under
pressure. Such site-selective collapse of magnetic moments originates from the
shifting of energy levels and the consequent charge transfer among the Fe-3d
orbits when Fe5O6 is being compressed. Our simulations suggest that there could
be high conductivity and volume contraction in Fe5O6 at high pressure, which
may induce anomalous features in seismic velocity, energy exchange, and mass

exhibit band-limited emission, whose frequency-dependent amplitude can be
modeled using a Gaussian function. In this analysis, we show that banded
emission of FRBs can lead to incompleteness across the observing band. This
biases the detected sample of bursts and can explain the various shapes of
cumulative energy distributions seen for repeating FRBs. We assume a Gaussian
shape of the burst spectra and used simulations to demonstrate the above bias
using an FRB 121102-like example. We recovered energy distributions that showed
a break in power-law and flattening of power-law at low energies, based on the
fluence threshold of the observations. We provide recommendations for
single-pulse searches and analysis of repeating FRBs to account for this
incompleteness. Primarily, we recommend that burst spectra should be modeled to
estimate the intrinsic fluence and bandwidth of the burst robustly. Also,
bursts that lie mainly within the observing band should be used for analyses of
energy distributions. We show that the bimodality reported in the distribution
of energies of FRB 121102 by Li et al. (2021) disappears when burst bandwidth,
instead of the center frequency of the observation, is used to estimate energy.
Sub-banded searches will also aid in detecting band-limited bursts. All the

with fine details and promote controllability for part-aware shape generation
and manipulation, yet trainable without any parts annotations. In SP-GAN, we
incorporate a global prior (uniform points on a sphere) to spatially guide the
generative process and attach a local prior (a random latent code) to each
sphere point to provide local details. The key insight in our design is to
disentangle the complex 3D shape generation task into a global shape modeling
and a local structure adjustment, to ease the learning process and enhance the
shape generation quality. Also, our model forms an implicit dense
correspondence between the sphere points and points in every generated shape,
enabling various forms of structure-aware shape manipulations such as part
editing, part-wise shape interpolation, and multi-shape part composition, etc.,
beyond the existing generative models. Experimental results, which include both
visual and quantitative evaluations, demonstrate that our model is able to
synthesize diverse point clouds with fine details and less noise, as compared
with the state-of-the-art models.

electronic structure and the magnetic properties of Fe4O5 predicted by the

We find that Fe4O5 stays metallic from ambient pressure to high pressure. The

Such site-selective magnetic moment collapse originates from the shift of

to provide decisive criteria for clarifying this issue. Although a

$T_c\sim 9$ K ($<<T_s\sim 90$ K), it remains unclear whether such an anisotropy
also persists at higher energies and associates with the nematic transition
$T_{\rm s}$. Here we use resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) to probe
the high-energy magnetic excitations of uniaxial-strain detwinned FeSe and
{\BFA}. A prominent anisotropy between the magnetic excitations along the $H$

more pronounced than the anisotropy of spin waves in {\BFA}. This anisotropy
decreases gradually with increasing temperature and finally vanishes at a
temperature around the nematic transition temperature $T_{\rm s}$. Our results
reveal an unprecedented strong spin-excitation anisotropy with a large energy
scale well above the $d_{xz}/d_{yz}$ orbital splitting, suggesting that the
nematic phase transition is primarily spin-driven. Moreover, the measured
high-energy spin excitations are dispersive and underdamped, which can be
understood from a local-moment perspective. Our findings provide the
much-needed understanding of the mechanism for the nematicity of FeSe and
points to a unified description of the correlation physics across seemingly
distinct classes of Fe-based superconductors.

We first investigate a conventional linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE)

contamination. After that, a deep learning based pilot design is proposed to
minimize the mean square error (MSE) of LMMSE channel estimation, which is
utilized to the joint pilot design and channel estimator for transfer learning
approach. For the channel estimator, we use a deep residual learning which
extracts the features of interference caused by pilot contamination and
eliminates them to estimate the channel information. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed joint pilot design and channel estimator
outperforms the conventional approach in multi-cell massive MIMO scenarios.
Furthermore, the joint pilot design and channel estimator using transfer
learning enhances the estimation performance by reducing the effects of pilot
contamination when the prior knowledge of pilot contamination cannot be
exploited.

adversarial method to train a variational RNN model. Contrary to competing
approaches, our approach has theoretical optimum in the model training and
provides better model training stability. Our approach also improves the

longitudinal electric fields for acceleration and longitudinal beam
manipulations can only be generated thanks to the resonant build-up of the
field in a high quality oscillator, the RF cavity, driven by a sinusoidal and
hence inherently non-linear excitation. The course gives an introduction to
linear and non-linear longitudinal beam dynamics, deriving the equations of
motion, as well as the RF potential and the Hamiltonian of the longitudinal
beam dynamics. Profiting from the non-linear dynamics, longitudinal beam
manipulations to control bunch length, distance with multiple RF systems are
shown as examples. Additionally, the distribution of the synchrotron
frequencies of the particles in a bunch can be modelled thanks to the
non-linearity of the applied RF voltage. Double- or even multi-harmonic RF

time, where two agents compete to choose the best possible item. When an agent
selects an item, he leaves the market and obtains a payoff given by the value
of the item, which is represented by a random variable following a known
distribution with support contained in [0, 1]. We consider two different
settings for this problem. In the first one, namely competitive selection
problem with no recall, agents observe the value of each item upon its arrival
and decide whether to accept or reject it, in which case they will not select
it in future. In the second setting, called competitive selection problem with
recall, agents are allowed to select any of the available items arrived so far.
For each of these problems, we describe the game induced by the selection
problem as a sequential game with imperfect information and study the set of
subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium payoffs. We also study the efficiency of the
game equilibria. More specifically, we address the question of how much better

price goods in online marketplaces and their revenue guarantees have been a
central object of study in the last decade. We consider a basic setting where
the buyers' valuations are independent and identically distributed and there is
a single unit on sale. It is well-known that this setting is equivalent to the
so-called i.i.d. prophet inequality, for which optimal guarantees are known and
evaluate to 0.745 in general (equivalent to a PPM with dynamic prices) and $1 -
1/e \approx 0.632$ in the fixed threshold case (equivalent to a fixed price
PPM). In this paper we consider an additional assumption, namely, that the
underlying market is very large. This is modeled by first fixing a valuation
distribution F and then making the number of buyers grow large, rather than
considering the worst distribution for each possible market size. In this
setting Kennedy and Kertz [Ann. Probab. 1991] breaks the 0.745 fraction
achievable in general with a dynamic threshold policy. We prove that this large
market benefit continue to hold when using fixed price PPMs, and show that the
guarantee of 0.632 actually improves to 0.712. We then move to study the case
of selling k identical units and we prove that the revenue gap of the fixed
price PPM approaches $1-1/\sqrt{ 2k\pi}$. As this bound is achievable without
the large market assumption, we obtain the somewhat surprising result that the
large market advantage vanishes as $k$ grows.

learning and computer vision. Although many image manipulation location
algorithms have been proposed, most of them only focus on the RGB images with
different color spaces, and the frequency information that contains the
potential tampering clues is often ignored. In this work, a novel end-to-end
two-stream boundary-aware network (abbreviated as TBNet) is proposed for
generic image manipulation localization in which the RGB stream, the frequency
stream, and the boundary artifact location are explored in a unified framework.
Specifically, we first design an adaptive frequency selection module (AFS) to
adaptively select the appropriate frequency to mine inconsistent statistics and
eliminate the interference of redundant statistics. Then, an adaptive
cross-attention fusion module (ACF) is proposed to adaptively fuse the RGB
feature and the frequency feature. Finally, the boundary artifact location
network (BAL) is designed to locate the boundary artifacts for which the
parameters are jointly updated by the outputs of the ACF, and its results are
further fed into the decoder. Thus, the parameters of the RGB stream, the
frequency stream, and the boundary artifact location network are jointly
optimized, and their latent complementary relationships are fully mined. The
results of extensive experiments performed on four public benchmarks of the
image manipulation localization task, namely, CASIA1.0, COVER, Carvalho, and
In-The-Wild, demonstrate that the proposed TBNet can significantly outperform
state-of-the-art generic image manipulation localization methods in terms of
both MCC and F1.

hierarchy is linearisable, and integrable in this sense, means that the time
evolving solution can be generated from the solution to the corresponding
linear dispersion equation in the hierarchy, combined with solving an
associated linear Fredholm equation representing the Marchenko equation.
Further, we show that within the class of polynomial partial differential
fields, at every order, each member of the non-commutative potential
Korteweg--de Vries hierarchy is unique. Indeed, we prove to all orders, that
each such member matches the non-commutative Lax hierarchy field, which is

constructing the abstract combinatorial algebra that underlies the

non-commutative polynomial algebra over the real line generated by the set of
all compositions endowed with the Poppe product. This product is the abstract
representation of the product rule for Hankel operators pioneered by Ch. Poppe
for integrable equations such as the Sine-Gordon and Korteweg-de Vries
equations. Integrability of the hierarchy members translates, in the
combinatorial algebra, to proving the existence of a `Poppe polynomial'
expansion for basic compositions in terms of `linear signature expansions'.
Proving the existence of such Poppe polynomial expansions boils down to solving
a linear algebraic problem for the expansion coefficients, which we solve

National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF), aiming to construct and operate an
array of nine Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) to study
gamma-ray sources at very high energy (TeV) and to perform stellar intensity
interferometry observations. This contribution describes the design and the
technologies used by the ASTRI team to implement the Online Observation Quality
System (OOQS). The main objective of the OOQS is to perform data quality
analyses in real-time during Cherenkov and intensity interferometry
observations to provide feedback to both the Central Control System and the
Operator. The OOQS performs the analysis of key data quality parameters and can
generate alarms to other sub-systems for a fast reaction to solve critical
conditions. The results from the data quality analyses are saved into the
Quality Archive for further investigations. The Operator can visualise the OOQS
results through the Operator Human Machine Interface as soon as they are
produced. The main challenge addressed by the OOQS design is to perform online
data quality checks on the data streams produced by nine telescopes, acquired
by the Array Data Acquisition System and forwarded to the OOQS. In the current
OOQS design, the Redis in-memory database manages the data throughput generated
by the telescopes, and the Slurm workload scheduler executes in parallel the
high number of data quality analyses.

traced by young stellar objects (YSOs). We then examine our survey region from
the outside, within apertures of varying sizes, and describe how the N-PDFs and
their relation to star formation changes with the size-scale. The N-PDFs of the
clouds are not well described by any single simple model; use of any single
model may bias the interpretation of the N-PDFs. The top-heaviness of the
N-PDFs correlates with star formation activity, and the correlation changes
with Galactic environment (spiral-/inter-arm regions). We find that the density
contrast of clouds may be more intimately linked to star formation than the
dense gas mass fraction. The aperture-averaged N-PDFs vary with the size-scale
and are more top-heavy for larger apertures. The top-heaviness of the aperture
N-PDFs correlates with star formation activity up to roughly 0.5 kpc
size-scale, depending on the environment. Our results suggest that the
relations between cloud structure and star formation are environment specific

flattening of the hierarchical models into an equation system for analysis.
However, the large-scale equations in complex models make structural analysis
difficult. Aimed to address the issue, this study proposes a hierarchical
structural analysis method by exploring the relationship between the
singularities of the hierarchical equation-oriented model and its components.
This method obtains the singularity of a hierarchical equation-oriented model
by analyzing a dummy model constructed with the parts from the decomposing
results of its components. Based on this, the structural singularity of a
complex model can be obtained by layer-by-layer analysis according to their
natural hierarchy. The hierarchical structural analysis method can reduce the
equation scale in each analysis and achieve efficient structural analysis of
very complex models. This method can be adaptively applied to
nonlinear-algebraic and differential-algebraic equation models. The main
algorithms, application cases and comparison with the existing methods are
present in this paper. The complexity analysis results show the enhanced
efficiency of the proposed method in the structural analysis of complex

learning and computer vision, and many person ReID approaches have been
proposed; however, most of these methods assume that the same person has the
same clothes within a short time interval, and thus their visual appearance
must be similar. However, in an actual surveillance environment, a given person
has a great probability of changing clothes after a long time span, and they
also often take different personal belongings with them. When the existing
person ReID methods are applied in this type of case, almost all of them fail.
To date, only a few works have focused on the cloth-changing person ReID task,
but since it is very difficult to extract generalized and robust features for
representing people with different clothes, their performances need to be
improved. Moreover, visual-semantic information is often ignored. To solve
these issues, in this work, a novel multigranular visual-semantic embedding
algorithm (MVSE) is proposed for cloth-changing person ReID, where visual
semantic information and human attributes are embedded into the network, and
the generalized features of human appearance can be well learned to effectively
solve the problem of clothing changes. Specifically, to fully represent a
person with clothing changes, a multigranular feature representation scheme
(MGR) is employed to focus on the unchanged part of the human, and then a cloth
desensitization network (CDN) is designed to improve the feature robustness of
the approach for the person with different clothing, where different high-level
human attributes are fully utilized. Moreover, to further solve the issue of
pose changes and occlusion under different camera perspectives, a partially
semantically aligned network (PSA) is proposed to obtain the visual-semantic

controversy. It has long been regarded as polymers-modulated inertial
turbulence (IT), but is challenged by the newly proposed concept of
elasto-inertial turbulence (EIT). This study is to re-picture DRT in parallel
plane channels by introducing dynamics of EIT based on statistical and budget
analysis for a series of flow regimes from the onset of DR to EIT. Energy
conversion between velocity fluctuations and polymers as well as polymeric
pressure redistribution effect are of particular concern, based on which a new
energy self-sustaining process (SSP) of DRT is re-pictured. The numerical
results indicate that at low Reynolds number (Re), the flow enters laminar
regime before EIT-related SSP is formed with the increase of elasticity,
whereas, at moderate Re, EIT-related SSP can get involved and survive from
being relaminarized. This somehow explains the reason why relaminarization is
observed for small Re while the flow directly enters MDR and EIT at moderate
Re. Moreover, with the proposed energy picture, the newly discovered phenomenon
that the streamwise velocity fluctuations lag behind those in wall-normal
direction can be well explained. The re-pictured SSP certainly justify that IT
nature is gradually replaced by that of EIT in DRT with the increase of
elasticity.

transmon qubits are noisy and prone to various errors. The errors can be
attributed to sources such as open quantum system effects and spurious

frequency transmon architectures is always present and contributes to both
coherent and incoherent crosstalk errors. Its suppression is therefore a key
step towards enhancing the fidelity of quantum computation using transmons.
Here we propose the use of dynamical decoupling to suppress the crosstalk, and
demonstrate the success of this scheme through experiments performed on several
IBM quantum cloud processors. In particular, we demonstrate improvements in
quantum memory as well as the performance of single-qubit and two-qubit gate
operations. We perform open quantum system simulations of the multi-qubit
processors and find good agreement with the experimental results. We analyze
the performance of the protocol based on a simple analytical model and
elucidate the importance of the qubit drive frequency in interpreting the
results. In particular, we demonstrate that the XY4 dynamical decoupling
sequence loses its universality if the drive frequency is not much larger than
the system-bath coupling strength. Our work demonstrates that dynamical
decoupling is an effective and practical way to suppress crosstalk and open
system effects, thus paving the way towards higher-fidelity logic gates in

the gap, we present a new loss for learning cross-modal embeddings in the
context of attribute-based person search. We regard a set of attributes as a
category of people sharing the same traits. In a joint embedding space of the
two modalities, our loss pulls images close to their person categories for
modality alignment. More importantly, it pushes apart a pair of person
categories by a margin determined adaptively by their semantic distance, where
the distance metric is learned end-to-end so that the loss considers importance
of each attribute when relating person categories. Our loss guided by the
adaptive semantic margin leads to more discriminative and semantically
well-arranged distributions of person images. As a consequence, it enables a

increasing attention by effectively finding high-quality neural architectures,
which however consumes high computational cost by training the architecture

Numerous ENAS approaches have been developed to reduce the evaluation cost, but
it is often difficult for most of these approaches to achieve high evaluation
accuracy. To address this issue, in this paper we propose an accelerated ENAS
via multifidelity evaluation termed MFENAS, where the individual evaluation
cost is significantly reduced by training the architecture encoded by each
individual for only a small number of epochs. The balance between evaluation
cost and evaluation accuracy is well maintained by suggesting a multi-fidelity
evaluation, which identifies the potentially good individuals that cannot
survive from previous generations by integrating multiple evaluations under
different numbers of training epochs. For high diversity of neural
architectures, a population initialization strategy is devised to produce
different neural architectures varying from ResNet-like architectures to
Inception-like ones. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 show that the
architecture obtained by the proposed MFENAS achieves a 2.39% test error rate
at the cost of only 0.6 GPU days on one NVIDIA 2080TI GPU, demonstrating the
superiority of the proposed MFENAS over state-of-the-art NAS approaches in
terms of both computational cost and architecture quality. The architecture
obtained by the proposed MFENAS is then transferred to CIFAR-100 and ImageNet,
which also exhibits competitive performance to the architectures obtained by
existing NAS approaches. The source code of the proposed MFENAS is available at

present an attempt to observationally describe atmospheric internal waves and
their associated turbulent eddies in detail, under varying stable conditions.
Therefore, we mounted 198 high-resolution temperature T-sensors with 1-m
spacing on a 200-m long cable. The instrumented cable was attached along the
213 m tall meteorological mast of Cabauw, the Netherlands, during late-summer
2017. The mast has standard meteorological equipment at extendable booms at 6
levels in height. A sonic anemometer is at 60 m above ground. The T-sensors
have a time constant in air of tau = 3 s and an apparent drift about 0.1
degC/mo. Also due to radiation effects, short-term measurement instability is
0.05 degC/h during nighttime and 0.5 degC/h during daytime. These T-sensor
characteristics hamper quantitative atmospheric turbulence research, due to a
relatively narrow inertial subrange of maximum one order of magnitude.
Nevertheless, height-time images from two contrasting nights show internal
waves up to the buoyancy period of about 300 s, and shear and convective
deformation of the stratification over the entire 197 m range of observations,
supported by nocturnal marginally stable stratification. Moderate winds lead to
20-m tall convection across weaker stratification, weak winds to episodic <10-m
tall shear instability across larger stratification.

However, recent developments have focused on computational or mathematical
adaptions, leaving their biological roots behind. This has left much of the
modern evolutionary literature relatively unexplored.
  To understand which evolutionary mechanisms have been considered, and which
have been overlooked, this paper breaks down successful bio-inspired algorithms
under a contemporary biological framework based on the Extended Evolutionary
Synthesis, an extension of the classical, genetics focussed, Modern Synthesis.
The analysis shows that Darwinism and the Modern Synthesis have been
incorporated into Evolutionary Computation but that the Extended Evolutionary
Synthesis has been broadly ignored beyond:cultural inheritance, incorporated in
the sub-set of Swarm Intelligence algorithms, evolvability, through CMA-ES, and
multilevel selection, through Multi-Level Selection Genetic Algorithm.
  The framework shows a missing gap in epigenetic inheritance for Evolutionary
Computation, despite being a key building block in modern interpretations of
how evolution occurs. Epigenetic inheritance can explain fast adaptation,
without changes in an individual's genotype, by allowing biological organisms
to self-adapt quickly to environmental cues, which, increases the speed of
convergence while maintaining stability in changing environments. This leaves a
diverse range of biologically inspired mechanisms as low hanging fruit that
should be explored further within Evolutionary Computation.

vulnerable to data poisoning attacks that may deteriorate its performance and
integrity due to its distributed nature and inaccessibility to the raw data. In
addition, it is extremely difficult to correctly identify malicious clients due

ridge regression. For a broad class of least squares problem instances (that
are natural in high-dimensional settings), we show: (1) for every problem
instance and for every ridge parameter, (unregularized) SGD, when provided with
logarithmically more samples than that provided to the ridge algorithm,
generalizes no worse than the ridge solution (provided SGD uses a tuned
constant stepsize); (2) conversely, there exist instances (in this wide problem
class) where optimally-tuned ridge regression requires quadratically more
samples than SGD in order to have the same generalization performance. Taken
together, our results show that, up to the logarithmic factors, the
generalization performance of SGD is always no worse than that of ridge
regression in a wide range of overparameterized problems, and, in fact, could
be much better for some problem instances. More generally, our results show how
algorithmic regularization has important consequences even in simpler
(overparameterized) convex settings.

structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been attracting the attention
of researchers. Various data-driven approaches have been introduced to capture
subtle and local morphological changes of the brain accompanied by the disease
progression. One of the typical approaches for capturing subtle changes is
patch-level feature representation. However, the predetermined regions to
extract patches can limit classification performance by interrupting the
exploration of potential biomarkers. In addition, the existing patch-level
analyses have difficulty explaining their decision-making. To address these
problems, we propose the BrainBagNet with a position-based gate
(PG-BrainBagNet), a framework for jointly learning pathological region
localization and AD diagnosis in an end-to-end manner. In advance, as all scans
are aligned to a template in image processing, the position of brain images can
be represented through the 3D Cartesian space shared by the overall MRI scans.
The proposed method represents the patch-level response from whole-brain MRI
scans and discriminative brain-region from position information. Based on the
outcomes, the patch-level class evidence is calculated, and then the
image-level prediction is inferred by a transparent aggregation. The proposed
models were evaluated on the ADNI datasets. In five-fold cross-validation, the
classification performance of the proposed method outperformed that of the
state-of-the-art methods in both AD diagnosis (AD vs. normal control) and mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion prediction (progressive MCI vs. stable
MCI) tasks. In addition, changes in the identified discriminant regions and
patch-level class evidence according to the patch size used for model training
are presented and analyzed.

language models for source code (e.g., CuBERT and CodeBERT) have been proposed
to model the context of code and serve as a basis for downstream code
intelligence tasks such as code search, code clone detection, and program
translation. Current approaches typically consider the source code as a plain
sequence of tokens, or inject the structure information (e.g., AST and
data-flow) into the sequential model pre-training. To further explore the
properties of programming languages, this paper proposes SynCoBERT, a
syntax-guided multi-modal contrastive pre-training approach for better code
representations. Specially, we design two novel pre-training objectives
originating from the symbolic and syntactic properties of source code, i.e.,
Identifier Prediction (IP) and AST Edge Prediction (TEP), which are designed to
predict identifiers, and edges between two nodes of AST, respectively.
Meanwhile, to exploit the complementary information in semantically equivalent
modalities (i.e., code, comment, AST) of the code, we propose a multi-modal
contrastive learning strategy to maximize the mutual information among
different modalities. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks related to
code intelligence show that SynCoBERT advances the state-of-the-art with the
same pre-training corpus and model size.

examine the congruence, or lack thereof, in the information-gathering

character recognition task. We have used eye-tracking to assay the spatial
distribution of information hotspots for humans via fixation maps and an
activation mapping technique for obtaining analogous distributions for deep
networks through visualization maps. Qualitative comparison between
visualization maps and fixation maps reveals an interesting correlate of
congruence. The deep learning model considered similar regions in character,
which humans have fixated in the case of correctly classified characters. On
the other hand, when the focused regions are different for humans and deep
nets, the characters are typically misclassified by the latter. Hence, we
propose to use the visual fixation maps obtained from the eye-tracking
experiment as a supervisory input to align the model's focus on relevant
character regions. We find that such supervision improves the model's
performance significantly and does not require any additional parameters. This
approach has the potential to find applications in diverse domains such as

show semi-universal relations across all the EoS. One parameter depends on the
shifting of the keplerian mass-radius curve from the static one and shows it is
a constant across all EoS. The Z-parameter shows how tidal deformability
depends on the quark content of the star and the stiffness of the EoS. The
quark content of the star also affects the compactness of the star, and its
dependence is almost universal. The empirical parameter gives a bound on the
quark content of the star and shows that if the amount of the quark content
increases, the stars are likely to collapse into a black hole. It is seen that
the change in the mass and radius after PT is linearly proportional to the mass
of the parent NS. Given a hadronic EoS, bag constant, and quark coupling
constant, one can have a critical mass of the neutron star and the maximum mass

community as a generalization of networks capable of encoding higher-order

Epidemic dynamics in hypergraphs has been studied by using the simplicial
susceptible-infected-susceptible ($s$-SIS) model; however, the efficient
immunization strategy for epidemics in hypergraphs is not studied despite the
importance of the topic in mathematical epidemiology. Here, we propose an
immunization strategy that immunizes hyperedges with high simultaneous
infection probability (SIP). This strategy can be implemented in general
hypergraphs. We also generalize the edge epidemic importance (EI)-based
immunization strategy, which is the state of the art in complex networks.
However, it does not perform as well as the SIP-based method in hypergraphs
despite its high computational cost. We also show that immunizing hyperedges
with high H-eigenscore effectively contains the epidemics in uniform
hypergraphs. A high SIP of a hyperedge suggests that the hyperedge is a
""hotspot"" of the epidemic process. Therefore, SIP can be used as a centrality
measure to quantify a hyperedge's influence on higher-order dynamics in general
hypergraphs. The effectiveness of the immunization strategies suggests the
necessity of scientific, data-driven, systematic policy-making for epidemic
containment.

$p^{l}_{T}$ threshold. The $A_{p^{W}_{T}}$ distributions are also reported from
the merged predictions with improved accuracy by the inclusion of
next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithm (N$^{3}$LL) corrections, i.e., at
NNLO+N$^{3}$LL. The predicted distributions from various $p^{l}_{T}$ thresholds
represent also a finer probe to provide more constraints on the ratio of $u$
and $d$ quark distribution functions in the parton momentum fraction range
$10^{-4} < x < 1$.

  Secure Encrypted Virtualization",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) offers protection mechanisms for
virtual machines in untrusted environments through memory and register
encryption. To separate security-sensitive operations from software executing
on the main x86 cores, SEV leverages the AMD Secure Processor (AMD-SP). This
paper introduces a new approach to attack SEV-protected virtual machines (VMs)
by targeting the AMD-SP. We present a voltage glitching attack that allows an
attacker to execute custom payloads on the AMD-SPs of all microarchitectures
that support SEV currently on the market (Zen 1, Zen 2, and Zen 3). The
presented methods allow us to deploy a custom SEV firmware on the AMD-SP, which
enables an adversary to decrypt a VM's memory. Furthermore, using our approach,
we can extract endorsement keys of SEV-enabled CPUs, which allows us to fake
attestation reports or to pose as a valid target for VM migration without
requiring physical access to the target host. Moreover, we reverse-engineered
the Versioned Chip Endorsement Key (VCEK) mechanism introduced with SEV Secure
Nested Paging (SEV-SNP). The VCEK binds the endorsement keys to the firmware
version of TCB components relevant for SEV. Building on the ability to extract
the endorsement keys, we show how to derive valid VCEKs for arbitrary firmware
versions. With our findings, we prove that SEV cannot adequately protect
confidential data in cloud environments from insider attackers, such as rogue
administrators, on currently available CPUs.

alignment of stakeholders' mental models. Making sure that all stakeholders
share the same vision of a changing system is crucial to the success of any
project. Misaligned mental models of stakeholders can lead to conflicting
requirements. A promising approach to this problem is the use of video showing
a system vision, so-called vision videos, which help stakeholders to disclose,
discuss, and align their mental models of the future system. However, videos
have the drawback of allowing viewers to adopt a passive role, as has been
shown in research on e-learning. In this role, viewers tend to be inactive,
unfocused and bored while watching a video. In this paper, we learn and adopt
findings from scientific literature in the field of e-learning on how to
mitigate this passive role while watching vision videos in requirements
engineering. In this way, we developed concepts that incorporate interactive
elements into vision videos to help viewers stay focused. These elements
include questions that are asked during the video and ways for viewers to
decide what happens next in the video. In a preliminary evaluation with twelve
participants, we found statistically significant differences when comparing the
interactive vision videos with their traditional form. Using an interactive
vision videos, viewers are noticeably more engaged and gather more information
on the shown system.

total distance of the routes under the capacity constraints of the vehicles.
But more often, the objective involves multiple criteria including not only the
total distance of the tour but also other factors such as travel costs, travel
time, and fuel consumption.Moreover, in reality, there are numerous implicit
preferences ingrained in the minds of the route planners and the drivers.
Drivers, for instance, have familiarity with certain neighborhoods and
knowledge of the state of roads, and often consider the best places for rest
and lunch breaks. This knowledge is difficult to formulate and balance when
operational routing decisions have to be made. This motivates us to learn the
implicit preferences from past solutions and to incorporate these learned
preferences in the optimization process. These preferences are in the form of
arc probabilities, i.e., the more preferred a route is, the higher is the joint
probability. The novelty of this work is the use of a neural network model to
estimate the arc probabilities, which allows for additional features and
automatic parameter estimation. This first requires identifying suitable
features, neural architectures and loss functions, taking into account that
there is typically few data available. We investigate the difference with a
prior weighted Markov counting approach, and study the applicability of neural
networks in this setting.

channel vector spatial correlation, which captures the fact that the

ideal performance based on ideal but partial CSI, i.e., the CSI that can be
estimated based on the users to antenna heads cluster connectivity. In
practice, CSI is estimated from UL pilots, and therefore it is affected by
noise and pilot contamination. We show that a very simple subspace projection

Cumulative Type Theory, CTT, which has more relaxed type-restrictions:

this paper, we set ourselves against CTT. We begin our case by arguing against
Linnebo & Rayo's claim that CTT sheds new philosophical light on set theory. We
then argue that, while CTT's type-restrictions are unjustifiable, the
type-restrictions imposed by STT are justified by a Fregean semantics. What is
more, this Fregean semantics provides us with a principled way to resist
Linnebo & Rayo's Semantic Argument for CTT. We end by examining an alternative

strategies correspond to purely radial and purely tangential motion. It is
notable that the value function exhibits smooth fit even when switching to
tangential motion, where the radius of the optimal process is deterministic.
Under sufficient regularity on the cost function, we prove optimality via
viscosity solutions of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. We extend the
results to cost functions that may become infinite at the origin. Extra care is
required to solve the control problem in this case, since it is not clear how

these single tasks are jointly learned, thereby providing an opportunity for
tasks to share information and obtain a more comprehensive understanding. To
this end, we develop UniNet, a unified scene understanding network that
accurately and efficiently infers vital vision tasks including object
detection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, monocular depth
estimation, and monocular instance depth prediction. As these tasks look at
different semantic and geometric information, they can either complement or
conflict with each other. Therefore, understanding inter-task relationships can
provide useful cues to enable complementary information sharing. We evaluate
the task relationships in UniNet through the lens of adversarial attacks based
on the notion that they can exploit learned biases and task interactions in the
neural network. Extensive experiments on the Cityscapes dataset, using
untargeted and targeted attacks reveal that semantic tasks strongly interact
amongst themselves, and the same holds for geometric tasks. Additionally, we
show that the relationship between semantic and geometric tasks is asymmetric
and their interaction becomes weaker as we move towards higher-level

is estimated via a packet-based communication network. We assume that the
system has multiple sensor nodes, affected by measurement noise, which can
transmit at discrete (non-equidistant) points in time. Moreover, each node can
transmit asynchronously. For this setup, we develop a state estimation
framework, where the transmission instances of the individual sensor nodes can
be generated in either time-triggered or event-triggered fashions. In the
latter case, we guarantee the absence of Zeno behavior by construction. It is
shown that, under the provided design conditions, an input-to-state stability
property is obtained for the estimation error with respect to the measurement
noise and process disturbances and that the state is thus reconstructed
asymptotically in the absence of noise. A numerical case study shows the
strengths of the developed framework.

closely related, but distinct, formulation, which is that it should correspond
to a particle with non-negative self-binding energy. This formulation is
particularly interesting in anti-de Sitter space, because it has a simple
conformal field theory (CFT) dual formulation: let $\Delta(q)$ be the dimension
of the lowest-dimension operator with charge $q$ under some global $U(1)$
symmetry, then $\Delta(q)$ must be a convex function of $q$. This formulation
avoids any reference to holographic dual forces or even to locality in
spacetime, and so we make a wild leap, and conjecture that such convexity of
the spectrum of charges holds for any (unitary) conformal field theory, not
just those that have weakly coupled and weakly curved duals. This Charge
Convexity Conjecture, and its natural generalization to larger global symmetry
groups, can be tested in various examples where anomalous dimensions can be
computed, by perturbation theory, $1/N$ expansions and semi-classical methods.

matching of fixed order QCD calculations with soft gluon resummation up to all
orders in the QCD coupling. It has been noticed in the literature that a
consistent description of DY data in a wide kinematic regime from fixed-target
to LHC energies is problematic. In this talk the predictions for transverse
momentum spectrum of DY data coming from experiments in very different
kinematic ranges (NuSea, R209, Phenix, LHC 8 TeV and 13 TeV center-of-mass

(TMD) parton distributions obtained from the Parton Branching (PB) method,
combined with the next-to-leading-order (NLO) calculation of the hard process

fixed order calculation and resummation, especially in the moderate to low mass

low DY mass and low $\sqrt{s}$ even in the region of $p_{\bot}/m_{DY}\sim 1$
the contribution of multiple soft gluon emissions (included in the PB-TMDs) is
essential to describe the measurements, while at larger masses and LHC energies
the contribution from soft gluons in the region of $p_{\bot}/m_{DY}\sim 1$ is
small.

detection and diagnosis of the white blood cells tend to avoid the human error
and reduce the time taken to classify the white blood cells. In the recent

underlying logic driving the reasoning behind Whitby is Situation Calculus,
which is a many-sorted logic with situation, action, and object sorts. The
Situation Calculus is applied to Ontology Authoring and Contingent Scaffolding:
the primary activities within Whitby. Thus many fluents and actions are
aggregated in Whitby from these two sub-applications and from Whitby itself,
but all are available through a common situation query interface that does not
depend upon any of the fluents or actions. Each STPA project in Whitby is a
single situation term, which is queried for fluents that include the ontology,
and to determine what pedagogical interventions to offer.
  Initially Whitby was written in Prolog using a module system. In the interest
of a cleaner architecture and implementation with improved code reuse and
extensibility, the initial application was refactored into Logtalk. This
refactoring includes decoupling the Situation Calculus reasoner, Ontology
Authoring framework, and Contingent Scaffolding framework into third-party
libraries that can be reused in other applications. This extraction was
achieved by inverting dependencies via Logtalk protocols and categories, which
are reusable interfaces and components that provide functionally cohesive sets
of predicate declarations and predicate definitions. In this paper the
architectures of two iterations of Whitby are evaluated with respect to the
motivations behind the refactor: clean architecture enabling code reuse and

found by scanning by eye the images of late-type galaxies with $m_B<15^m$ and
$M_B>-18^m$ and photometric diameter $D_{25}<12$~kpc. We found that apart from
the lower average gas (HI) fraction the other properties of dS-galaxies
including the presence of a bar and the isolation index do not differ much from
those for dwarf Irr or Sm-types of similar luminosity and rotation velocity (or
specific angular momentum).There are practically no dS-galaxies with rotation
velocity below 50\,--\,60~km\,sec$^{-1}$.
  To check the conditions of formation of spiral structure in dwarf galaxies we
carried out a series of N-body/hydrodynamic simulations of low-mass
stellar-gaseous discy galaxies by varying the model kinematic parameters of
discs, their initial thickness, relative masses and scale lengths of stellar
and gaseous disc components, and stellar-to-dark halo masses. We came to
conclusion that the gravitational mechanism of spiral structure formation is
effective only for thin stellar discs, which are non-typical for dwarf
galaxies, and for not too slowly rotating galaxies. Therefore, only a small
fraction of dwarf galaxies with stellar/gaseous discs have spiral or ring
structures. The thicker stellar disc, the more gas is required for the spiral
structure to form. The reduced gas content in many dS-galaxies compared to
non-spiral ones may be a result of more efficient star formation due to a
higher volume gas density thank to the thinner stellar/gaseous discs.

is analyzed numerically for different values of the specific permeability of
the capsule, and the thickness of the porous and the electric double layers.
The minimum of electrophoretic velocity dependence on the inverse permeability
of the porous layer has been found. This means that the capsule can move with
the same velocity at different permeabilities of the porous shell, other
conditions being equal, which is relevant for the practical use of the
discovered effect. It is shown that the electrophoretic mobility decreases upon
decrease in the conductivity of the material of constituting the porous layer.
This means that a dielectric capsule can be used for electrophoresis as well.

  Autonomous Driving","Accepted to IEEE 94th Vehicular Technology Conference (VTC2021-Fall)",,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Cooperative intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are used by autonomous
vehicles to communicate with surrounding autonomous vehicles and roadside units
(RSU). Current C-ITS applications focus primarily on real-time information
sharing, such as cooperative perception. In addition to real-time information
sharing, self-driving cars need to coordinate their action plans to achieve
higher safety and efficiency. For this reason, this study defines a vehicle's
future action plan/path and designs a cooperative path-planning model at
intersections using future path sharing based on the future path information of
multiple vehicles. The notion is that when the RSU detects a potential conflict
of vehicle paths or an acceleration opportunity according to the shared future
paths, it will generate a coordinated path update that adjusts the speeds of
the vehicles. We implemented the proposed method using the open-source Autoware
autonomous driving software and evaluated it with the LGSVL autonomous vehicle
simulator. We conducted simulation experiments with two vehicles at a blind
intersection scenario, finding that each car can travel safely and more
efficiently by planning a path that reflects the action plans of all vehicles
involved. The time consumed by introducing the RSU is 23.0 % and 28.1 % shorter
than that of the stand-alone autonomous driving case at the intersection.

  We started by gathering a list of test smells from existing research and
selecting test smells that can be considered language-agnostic or have similar
functionality in Python's standard Unittest framework. In total, we identified
17 diverse test smells. Additionally, we searched for Python-specific test
smells by mining frequent code change patterns that can be considered as either
fixing or introducing test smells. Based on these changes, we proposed our own
test smell called Suboptimal assert. To detect all these test smells, we
developed a tool called PyNose in the form of a plugin to PyCharm, a popular
Python IDE. Finally, we conducted a large-scale empirical investigation aimed
at analyzing the prevalence of test smells in Python code. Our results show
that 98% of the projects and 84% of the test suites in the studied dataset
contain at least one test smell. Our proposed Suboptimal assert smell was
detected in as much as 70.6% of the projects, making it a valuable addition to
the list.

single crystals, La$_x$Y$_{1-x}$VO$_{3}$ (x = 0, 0.1, and 0.2), has been
investigated by applying the X-ray diffraction, specific heat, magnetization
and Raman scattering techniques. The larger nearest-neighbor (NN) exchange
interaction along c-axis stabilizes the fluctuant G-type orbital ordering
(G-OO) which favors the exotic C-type antiferromagnetic order (C-AF). It is
found that the NN exchange interaction in ab plane is anisotropy relating to
the in plane magnetic anisotropy, which becomes smaller in high La-doped
sample. Most interestingly, with increasing the La$^{3+}$ content the orbital
fluctuation and hybridization are decreased which stabilizes the C-OO phase and
destabilizes the G-OO phase. Meanwhile, the diamagnetism in the exotic C-AF
phase becomes weak and the possible mechanism relates to the change of the
competition between the single-ion magnetic anisotropy and the
Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) interaction with increasing x. Finally, the strong
spin-orbital coupling has been observed at temperature just above T$_N$ in
La$_{0.2}$Y$_{0.8}$VO$_{3}$ and a short range spin-orbital correlation is
suggested.

resonance frequency deviations due to events of interest are being advocated
for a variety of applications. All sensor schemes currently in use are subject
to a basic trade-off between accuracy and speed, while there is great interest
in improving both in order to enable unprecedented and widespread applications.
Based on a thorough understanding of the characteristics of current resonant
sensor architectures, we propose adaptive and flexible sensor schemes. Unlike
recently proposed time-resolved mechanical detection methods, the proposed
schemes do not require ensemble averaging of the resonator response for many
independent identical stimuli. Distinct one-time events can be detected in
real-time with high time resolution with an accuracy that then improves
considerably with elapsed time. While the proposed adaptive schemes also need
to abide by the fundamental speed versus accuracy trade-off, we show that there
is still ""some room at the bottom"" for improvement with sensor architecture
innovations. Pareto optimal performance that reaches a bound that is imposed by
the fundamental thermomechanical noise can be achieved.

requires access to expert-driven, manually annotated datasets. If more than a
single expert is involved in the annotation of the same images, then the
inter-expert agreement is not necessarily perfect, and no single expert
annotation can precisely capture the so-called ground truth of the regions of
interest on all images. Also, it is not trivial to generate a reference
estimate using annotations from multiple experts. Here we present a deep neural
network, defined as U-Net-and-a-half, which can simultaneously learn from
annotations performed by multiple experts on the same set of images.
U-Net-and-a-half contains a convolutional encoder to generate features from the
input images, multiple decoders that allow simultaneous learning from image
masks obtained from annotations that were independently generated by multiple
experts, and a shared low-dimensional feature space. To demonstrate the
applicability of our framework, we used two distinct datasets from digital
pathology and radiology, respectively. Specifically, we trained two separate
models using pathologist-driven annotations of glomeruli on whole slide images
of human kidney biopsies (10 patients), and radiologist-driven annotations of
lumen cross-sections of human arteriovenous fistulae obtained from
intravascular ultrasound images (10 patients), respectively. The models based
on U-Net-and-a-half exceeded the performance of the traditional U-Net models
trained on single expert annotations alone, thus expanding the scope of
multitask learning in the context of biomedical image segmentation.

estimate the detection efficiency for air showers as function of their arrival
direction, energy, and impact point on the ground. In addition, the transparent
internal relationships between the different stages of the air-shower detection
process in our probabilistic approach enable to estimate the uncertainty of the
efficiency and, consequently, of the aperture of radio arrays. The details of

of the system. An increase of the interaction radius shifts the phase
transition temperature to the low-temperature area. The effects of dilution on
kagome artificial spin ice were also investigated. It is shown that the phase
transition occurs up to $p_c\approx0.35$ dilution concentrations, that well
coincides with the Sykes and Essam theory. Further dilution leads to the phase
transition disappearance.

  Systems",,,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recommendation for new users, also called user cold start, has been a
well-recognized challenge for online recommender systems. Most existing methods
view the crux as the lack of initial data. However, in this paper, we argue
that there are neglected problems: 1) New users' behaviour follows much
different distributions from regular users. 2) Although personalized features
are involved, heavily imbalanced samples prevent the model from balancing
new/regular user distributions, as if the personalized features are
overwhelmed. We name the problem as the ""submergence"" of personalization. To
tackle this problem, we propose a novel module: Personalized COld Start MOdules
(POSO). Considering from a model architecture perspective, POSO personalizes
existing modules by introducing multiple user-group-specialized sub-modules.
Then, it fuses their outputs by personalized gates, resulting in comprehensive
representations. In such way, POSO projects imbalanced features to even
modules. POSO can be flexibly integrated into many existing modules and
effectively improves their performance with negligible computational overheads.
The proposed method shows remarkable advantage in industrial scenario. It has
been deployed on the large-scale recommender system of Kwai, and improves new
user Watch Time by a large margin (+7.75%). Moreover, POSO can be further
generalized to regular users, inactive users and returning users (+2%-3% on
Watch Time), as well as item cold start (+3.8% on Watch Time). Its
effectiveness has also been verified on public dataset (MovieLens 20M). We
believe such practical experience can be well generalized to other scenarios.

involves predicting the trajectory of a moving object across a network of
cameras. While multi-camera setups are widespread for applications such as
surveillance and traffic monitoring, existing trajectory forecasting methods
typically focus on single-camera trajectory forecasting (SCTF), limiting their
use for such applications. Furthermore, using a single camera limits the
field-of-view available, making long-term trajectory forecasting impossible. We
address these shortcomings of SCTF by developing an MCTF framework that
simultaneously uses all estimated relative object locations from several
viewpoints and predicts the object's future location in all possible
viewpoints. Our framework follows a Which-When-Where approach that predicts in
which camera(s) the objects appear and when and where within the camera views
they appear. To this end, we propose the concept of trajectory tensors: a new
technique to encode trajectories across multiple camera views and the
associated uncertainties. We develop several encoder-decoder MCTF models for
trajectory tensors and present extensive experiments on our own database
(comprising 600 hours of video data from 15 camera views) created particularly
for the MCTF task. Results show that our trajectory tensor models outperform
coordinate trajectory-based MCTF models and existing SCTF methods adapted for
MCTF. Code is available from: https://github.com/olly-styles/Trajectory-Tensors

We applied three-dimensional Monte Carlo (3D MC) simulations to model the

in the free molecular flow regime of an atmospheric gas. We derived individual,
time-dependent (TiO$_2$)$_{\rm N}$ cluster number densities. For $T=1000$K, the
results are compared to a kinetic approach that utilises thermodynamic data for
individual (TiO$_2$)$_{\rm N}$ clusters. The {(TiO$_2$)$_{\rm N}$} cluster size
distribution is temperature dependent and evolves in time until a steady state
is reached. For $T=1000$K, the 3D MC and the kinetic approach agree well
regarding the cluster number densities for $N=1\,\ldots\,10$, the vivid onset
of cluster formation, and the long transition into a steady state.
Collision-induced growth and evaporation simulated using a 3D MC approach
enables a faster onset of cluster growth through nucleation bursts. Different
size distributions develop for monomer-cluster and for cluster-cluster growth,
with the largest clusters appearing for cluster-cluster growth. The
(TiO$_2$)$_N$ cluster growth efficiency has a sweet-spot temperature at

investigate the superradiant instability of the Kerr-like black hole under the
perturbation of a massive scalar field. We find the Lorentz breaking parameter
$L$ does not affect the superradiance regime or the regime of the bound states.
However, since $L$ appears in the metric and its effect cannot be erased by
redefining the rotation parameter $\tilde{a}=\sqrt{1+L}a$, it indeed affects
the bound state spectrum and the superradiance. We calculate the bound state
spectrum via the continued-fraction method and show the influence of $L$ on the
maximum binding energy and the damping rate. The superradiant instability could
occur since the superradiance condition and the bound state condition could be
both satisfied. Compared with Kerr black hole, the nature of the superradiant
instability of this black hole depends non-monotonously not only on the
rotation parameter of the black hole $\tilde{a}$ and the product of the black
hole mass $M$ and the field mass $\mu$, but also on the Lorentz breaking
parameter $L$. Through the Monte Carlo method, we find that for $l=m=1$ state

of adamantane and ortho-carborane $C_{2}B_{10}H_{12}$ (atomic ratio B:C =
5:95). This result shows convincingly the catalytical activity of boron in the
synthesis of diamond under high pressure. At pressures lower than 7 GPa, only
graphite is synthesized from the adamantane and carborane mixture.
Graphitization starts at quite low temperatures (below $1400 ^{o}C$) and an
increase in temperature simultaneously increases boron content and the quality

allows us to assume that the substitutional boron atoms are distributed
periodically and equidistantly from each other in the graphite layers at high
boron concentrations (>1 at.%). The theoretical arguments and model ab initio

exposed to intense pulses of x-rays from free-electron lasers to record
diffraction patterns of single, isolated molecules. The reconstruction for
structure determination relies on signal from many identical particles.
Therefore, well-defined-sample delivery conditions are desired in order to
achieve sample uniformity, including avoidance of charge polydispersity. We
have observed charging of 220 nm polystyrene particles in an aerosol beam
created by a gas-dynamic virtual nozzle focusing technique, without intentional
charging of the nanoparticles. Here, we present a deflection method for
detecting and characterizing the charge states of a beam of aerosolized
nanoparticles. Our analysis of the observed charge-state distribution using
optical light-sheet localization microscopy and quantitative particle
trajectory simulations is consistent with previous descriptions of skewed
charging probabilities of triboelectrically charged nanoparticles.

approaches to the process of tropicalization of the universal compactified
Jacobian over the moduli space of curves -- one from a logarithmic and the
other from a non-Archimedean analytic point of view. The central result from
both points of view is that the tropicalization of the universal compactified
Jacobian is the universal tropical Jacobian and that the tropicalization maps
in each of the two contexts are compatible with the tautological morphisms. In
a sequel we will use the techniques developed here to provide explicit
polyhedral models for the logarithmic Picard variety.

thin NbTiN films, which are intensively exploited in superconducting devices.
Studied NbTiN films with thicknesses less than 10~nm are disordered with
respect to electron transport, the Ioffe-Regel parameter of $k_F l_e = 2.5-3.0$
($k_F$ is the Fermi wave vector and $l_e$ is the electron mean free path), and
inelastic electron-phonon interaction, the product $q_T l_e \ll 1$ ($q_T$ is
the wave vector of a thermal phonon). By means of magnetoconductance and
photoresponse techniques, we derived the inelastic electron-phonon scattering
rate $1/\tau_{e-ph}$ and determined sound velocities and phonon heat
capacities. In the temperature range from 12 to 20~K, the scattering rate
varies with temperature as $1/\tau_{e-ph}\propto T^{3.45\pm0.05}$; its value
extrapolated to 10~K amounts to approximately 16~ps. Making a comparative
analysis of our films and other films used in superconducting devices, such as
polycrystalline granular NbN and amorphous WSi, we found a systematic reduction
of the sound velocity in all these films by about 50\% as compared to the
corresponding bulk crystalline materials. A corresponding increase in the
phonon heat capacities in all these films is, however, less than the Debye
model predicts. We attribute these findings to reduced film dimensionality and
film morphology.

The mode and other high-probability translations found by beam search have been
shown to often be inadequate in a number of ways. This prevents improving
translation quality through better search, as these idiosyncratic translations
end up selected by the decoding algorithm, a problem known as the beam search
curse. Recently, an approximation to minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding has been
proposed as an alternative decision rule that would likely not suffer from the
same problems. We analyse this approximation and establish that it has no
equivalent to the beam search curse. We then design approximations that
decouple the cost of exploration from the cost of robust estimation of expected
utility. This allows for much larger hypothesis spaces, which we show to be
beneficial. We also show that mode-seeking strategies can aid in constructing
compact sets of promising hypotheses and that MBR is effective in identifying
good translations in them. We conduct experiments on three language pairs
varying in amounts of resources available: English into and from German,
Romanian, and Nepali.

maximum distance separable (MDS) code { and show that these concepts can
achieve better error performance than index modulation (IM) and related
schemes.} In the first concept, we use amplitude and phase levels to form a
simple MDS code, whereas, in the second one, in-phase and quadrature components
of codeword elements are used to construct the MDS code. We depict practical
schemes for using the proposed concepts with orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM). We analyze the performance in terms of the minimum
Euclidean distance and bit error rate. We also show that the proposed
techniques exhibit desirable properties such as efficient low-complexity
detection, very simple bits-to-symbols, and symbols-to-bits mappings, and a
better error performance when compared to the OFDM-IM and related schemes. More
importantly, contrary to the vast majority of IM studies that focus on showing
the superiority of the IM techniques against conventional modulation
techniques, we show that modulation concepts based on a well-known MDS code can
achieve better error performance than the IM and related schemes while
exhibiting a structure as simple as these schemes.

open question. In this work, we make a comprehensive study on the variation
phenomena of the spectral index and polarization degree (PD) to deeply
understand the variation mechanism of B2 1633+382 (4C 38.41). We use the local
cross-correlation function (LCCF) to perform the correlation analysis between
multi-wavelength light curves. We find that both $\gamma$-ray and optical
$V$-band are correlated with the radio 15 GHz at the beyond 3$\sigma$
confidence level. Based on the lag analysis, the emitting regions of
$\gamma$-ray and optical locate at $14.2_{-2.4}^{+0}$ pc and
$14.2_{-8.3}^{+8.3}$ pc upstream of the core region of radio 15 GHz, and are
far away from the broad-line region (BLR). The broad lines in the spectrum
indicate the existence of the accretion disk component in the radiation. Thus,
we consider the two-component (TC) model, which includes the relative constant
background component and the varying jet component to study the variation
behaviors. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedure is adopted to study
the physical parameters of the jet and the background components. To some
extent, the study of normalized residuals indicates that the TC model fits
better than the linear fitting model. The jet with helical magnetic field is
hopeful to explain the variation, and the shock in jet model is not completely
ruled out.

on the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission features prevalent

some however showing a saturation at larger distances; (ii) the relative
intensities of the 6.2 and 8.6 features with respect to the 11.2 micron feature
remain high throughout the globule, suggesting a larger cation-to-neutral PAH
ratio of the order of unity; the breakdown from pypahdb confirms a high ionized
fraction within the cloud; (iii) the pypahdb results display a decrease in
large PAH fraction with increased distance from HD 130079, as well as a
statistically significant correlation between the large size fraction and the

exchanging gradient information between different clients. Although training
data entirely resides with the clients, recent work shows that training data
can be reconstructed from such exchanged gradient information. To enhance
privacy, gradient perturbation techniques have been proposed. However, they
come at the cost of reduced model performance, increased convergence time, or
increased data demand. In this paper, we introduce PRECODE, a PRivacy EnhanCing
mODulE that can be used as generic extension for arbitrary model architectures.
We propose a simple yet effective realization of PRECODE using variational
modeling. The stochastic sampling induced by variational modeling effectively
prevents privacy leakage from gradients and in turn preserves privacy of data
owners. We evaluate PRECODE using state of the art gradient inversion attacks
on two different model architectures trained on three datasets. In contrast to
commonly used defense mechanisms, we find that our proposed modification
consistently reduces the attack success rate to 0% while having almost no
negative impact on model training and final performance. As a result, PRECODE
reveals a promising path towards privacy enhancing model extensions.

control fields applied to physical qubits to drive the gates. One approach to
reduce this source of error is to break the gate into parts, known as composite
pulses (CPs), that typically leverage the constancy of the error over time to
mitigate its impact on gate fidelity. Here we extend this technique to suppress
secular drifts in Rabi frequency by regarding them as sums of power-law drifts
whose first-order effects on over- or under-rotation of the state vector add
linearly. Power-law drifts have the form $t^p$ where $t$ is time and the
constant $p$ is its power. We show that composite pulses that suppress all
power-law drifts with $p \leq n$ are also high-pass filters of filter order
$n+1$ arXiv:1410.1624. We present sequences that satisfy our proposed power-law
amplitude criteria, $\text{PLA}(n)$, obtained with this technique, and compare
their simulated performance under time-dependent amplitude errors to some
traditional composite pulse sequences. We find that there is a range of noise
frequencies for which the $\text{PLA}(n)$ sequences provide more error
suppression than the traditional sequences, but in the low frequency limit,
non-linear effects become more important for gate fidelity than frequency
roll-off. As a result, the previously known $F_1$ sequence, which is one of the
two solutions to the $\text{PLA}(1)$ criteria and furnishes suppression of both
linear secular drift and the first order nonlinear effects, is a sharper noise
filter than any of the other $\text{PLA}(n)$ sequences in the low frequency
limit.

is seeking to reconstruct a latent clustering that has been corrupted by random

""post-adversarial"" model in the literature, in which adversarial modifications
come after the noise. Here, we introduce and analyse a ""pre-adversarial"" model
in which adversarial modifications come before the noise. Given an input coming
from such a semi-adversarial generative model, the goal is to reconstruct
almost perfectly and with high probability the latent clustering. We focus on
the case where the hidden clusters have nearly equal size and show the
following. In the pre-adversarial setting, spectral algorithms are optimal, in
the sense that they reconstruct all the way to the information-theoretic
threshold beyond which no reconstruction is possible. This is in contrast to
the post-adversarial setting, in which their ability to restore the hidden
clusters stops before the threshold, but the gap is optimally filled by
SDP-based algorithms. These results highlight a heretofore unknown robustness
of spectral algorithms, showing them less brittle than previously thought.

vision and influences the quality and time of goal directed decision making in
animals and humans, as discussed in recent work on the examples of symmetry of
things in a thing and bilateral shape symmetry. The present study was designed
to show that selective chromatic variations in geometric shape configurations
with mirror symmetry can be exploited to highlight functional properties of
symmetry of things in a thing in human vision. The experimental procedure uses
a psychophysical two alternative forced choice technique, where human observers
have to decide as swiftly as possible whether two shapes presented
simultaneously on a computer screen are symmetrical or not. The stimuli are
computer generated 2D shape configurations consisting of multiple elements,
with and without systematic variations in local color, color saturation, or
achromatic contrast producing variations in symmetry of things in a thing. All
stimulus pairs presented had perfect geometric mirror symmetry. The results
show that varying the color of local shape elements selectively in
multichromatic and monochromatic shapes significantly slows down perceptual
response times, which are a direct measure of stimulus uncertainty. It is
concluded that local variations in hue or contrast produce functionally
meaningful variations in symmetry of things in thing, revealed here as a
relevant perceptual variable in symmetry detection. Disturbance of the latter
increases stimulus uncertainty and thereby affects the perceptual salience of
mirror symmetry in the time course for goal relevant human decisions.

problems for structured systems. Given are an autonomous system and a
prescribed set of input links, where each input link has a non-negative cost.
The problems include selecting the minimum cost of input links, and selecting
the input links with the smallest possible cost with a bound on their
cardinality, all to ensure system structural controllability. Current studies
show that in the dedicated input case (i.e., each input can actuate only a
state variable), the former problem is polynomially solvable by some
graph-theoretic algorithms, while the general nontrivial constrained case is
largely unexploited. We show these problems can be formulated as equivalent
integer linear programming (ILP) problems. Subject to a certain condition on
the prescribed input configurations that contains the dedicated input one as a
special case, we demonstrate that the constraint matrices of these ILPs are
totally unimodular. This property allows us to solve those ILPs efficiently
simply via their linear programming (LP) relaxations, leading to a unifying
algebraic method for these problems with polynomial time complexity. It is
further shown those problems could be solved in strongly polynomial time,

content-centric services. The requested contents are partitioned into
sub-contents, which are then 'beam- formed' by the remote radio heads (RRHs)
for transmission to the users. Since a large number of beamformers must be
designed, this poses a computational challenge. We tackle this challenge by
proposing a new class of regularized zero forcing beamforming (RZFB) for
directly mitigating the inter-content interferences, while the 'intra-content
interference' is mitigated by successive interference cancellation at the user
end. Thus each beamformer is decided by a single real variable (for proper
Gaus- sian signaling) or by a pair of complex variables (for improper Gaussian
signaling). Hence the total number of decision variables is substantially
reduced to facilitate tractable computation. To address the problem of energy
efficiency optimization subject to multiple constraints, such as individual
user-rate requirement and the fronthauling constraint of the links between the
RRHs and the centralized baseband signal processing unit, as well as the total
transmit power budget, we develop low-complexity path- following algorithms.
Finally, we actualize their performance by simulations.

  Convolutional Network for Multi-class Trajectory Prediction",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Predicting the movement trajectories of multiple classes of road users in
real-world scenarios is a challenging task due to the diverse trajectory
patterns. While recent works of pedestrian trajectory prediction successfully
modelled the influence of surrounding neighbours based on the relative
distances, they are ineffective on multi-class trajectory prediction. This is
because they ignore the impact of the implicit correlations between different
types of road users on the trajectory to be predicted - for example, a nearby
pedestrian has a different level of influence from a nearby car. In this paper,
we propose to introduce class information into a graph convolutional neural
network to better predict the trajectory of an individual. We embed the class
labels of the surrounding objects into the label adjacency matrix (LAM), which
is combined with the velocity-based adjacency matrix (VAM) comprised of the
objects' velocity, thereby generating a semantics-guided graph adjacency (SAM).
SAM effectively models semantic information with trainable parameters to
automatically learn the embedded label features that will contribute to the
fixed velocity-based trajectory. Such information of spatial and temporal
dependencies is passed to a graph convolutional and temporal convolutional
network to estimate the predicted trajectory distributions. We further propose
new metrics, known as Average2 Displacement Error (aADE) and Average Final
Displacement Error (aFDE), that assess network accuracy more accurately. We
call our framework Semantics-STGCNN. It consistently shows superior performance
to the state-of-the-arts in existing and the newly proposed metrics.

construct a model whereby two classes of objects follow an underlying Gaussian

levels of noise. This model mimics the nature of scientific data sets, where
the noises arise as realizations of some random processes whose underlying
distributions are known. The classification of these objects can then be
performed using standard statistical techniques (e.g., least-squares
minimization or Markov-Chain Monte Carlo), as well as ML techniques. This
allows us to take advantage of a maximum likelihood approach to object
classification, and to measure the amount by which the ML methods are
incorporating the information in the input data uncertainties. We show that,
when each data point is subject to different levels of noise (i.e., noises with
different distribution functions), that information can be learned by the CNNs,
raising the ML performance to at least the same level of the least-squares
method -- and sometimes even surpassing it. Furthermore, we show that, with
varying noise levels, the confidence of the ML classifiers serves as a proxy

exoplanets that receive stellar irradiance of approximately Earth's raised the
prospect of finding habitable planets in the coming decade, because some of
these temperate planets may support liquid water oceans if they do not have
massive H2/He envelopes and are thus not too hot at the bottom of the
envelopes. For planets larger than Earth, and especially planets in the 1.7-3.5
R_Earth population, the mass of the H2/He envelope is typically not
sufficiently constrained to assess the potential habitability. Here we show
that the solubility equilibria vs. thermochemistry of carbon and nitrogen gases
results in observable discriminators between small H2 atmospheres vs. massive
ones, because the condition to form a liquid-water ocean and that to achieve
the thermochemical equilibrium are mutually exclusive. The dominant carbon and
nitrogen gases are typically CH4 and NH3 due to thermochemical recycling in a
massive atmosphere of a temperate planet, and those in a small atmosphere
overlying a liquid-water ocean are most likely CO2 and N2, followed by CO and
CH4 produced photochemically. NH3 is depleted in the small atmosphere by
dissolution into the liquid-water ocean. These gases lead to distinctive
features in the planet's transmission spectrum, and a moderate number of
repeated transit observations with the James Webb Space Telescope should tell
apart a small atmosphere vs. a massive one on planets like K2-18 b. This method
thus provides a way to use near-term facilities to constrain the atmospheric
mass and habitability of temperate sub-Neptune exoplanets.

that adding a second hidden layer and choosing a symmetric metric for learning,
the activities of the neurons become almost quantized and more informative.

the logical score and the size of the weights. It exhibits a form of sparsity

by leveraging 8.8M daily on-device detections collected among 11.7M customers
of a popular mobile security product between 2019 and 2020. We show that the
current security model of Android, which limits security products to run as
regular apps and prevents them from automatically removing malicious apps opens
a significant window of opportunity for attackers. Such apps warn users about
the newly discovered threats, but users do not promptly act on this
information, allowing PHAs to persist on their device for an average of 24 days
after they are detected. We also find that while app markets remove PHAs after
these become known, there is a significant delay between when PHAs are
identified and when they are removed: PHAs persist on Google Play for 77 days
on average and 34 days on third party marketplaces. Finally, we find evidence
of PHAs migrating to other marketplaces after being removed on the original
one. This paper provides an unprecedented view of the Android PHA landscape,
showing that current defenses against PHAs on Android are not as effective as
commonly thought, and identifying multiple research directions that the
security community should pursue, from orchestrating more effective PHA
takedowns to devising better alerts for mobile security products.

is a classical federated learning algorithm in which clients run multiple local
SGD steps before communicating their update to an orchestrating server. We
propose a new federated learning algorithm, FedPAGE, able to further reduce the
communication complexity by utilizing the recent optimal PAGE method (Li et
al., 2021) instead of plain SGD in FedAvg. We show that FedPAGE uses much fewer
communication rounds than previous local methods for both federated convex and
nonconvex optimization. Concretely, 1) in the convex setting, the number of
communication rounds of FedPAGE is $O(\frac{N^{3/4}}{S\epsilon})$, improving
the best-known result $O(\frac{N}{S\epsilon})$ of SCAFFOLD (Karimireddy et
al.,2020) by a factor of $N^{1/4}$, where $N$ is the total number of clients
(usually is very large in federated learning), $S$ is the sampled subset of
clients in each communication round, and $\epsilon$ is the target error; 2) in
the nonconvex setting, the number of communication rounds of FedPAGE is
$O(\frac{\sqrt{N}+S}{S\epsilon^2})$, improving the best-known result
$O(\frac{N^{2/3}}{S^{2/3}\epsilon^2})$ of SCAFFOLD (Karimireddy et al.,2020) by
a factor of $N^{1/6}S^{1/3}$, if the sampled clients $S\leq \sqrt{N}$. Note
that in both settings, the communication cost for each round is the same for
both FedPAGE and SCAFFOLD. As a result, FedPAGE achieves new state-of-the-art
results in terms of communication complexity for both federated convex and
nonconvex optimization.

dynamical gap formation is also manifested by the slow oscillation component of
the Hall conductivity; that is, its frequency increases with time toward the
pulse peak at which it nearly coincides with the photoinduced direct gap. The

perceptual quality in various computer-generated imagery. Inspired by this, we
present the first method that reduces the ""perceived speckle noise"" by
integrating foveal and peripheral vision characteristics of the HVS, along with
the retinal point spread function, into the phase hologram computation.
Specifically, we introduce the anatomical and statistical retinal receptor
distribution into our computational hologram optimization, which places a
higher priority on reducing the perceived foveal speckle noise while being
adaptable to any individual's optical aberration on the retina. Our method
demonstrates superior perceptual quality on our emulated holographic display.
Our evaluations with objective measurements and subjective studies demonstrate
a significant reduction of the human perceived noise.

recycling management industries. The need for smart systems for environmental
monitoring and the enhancement of recycling processes is thus greater than
ever. Amongst these efforts lies IBM's Wastenet project which aims to improve
recycling by using artificial intelligence for waste classification. The work
reported in this paper builds on this project through the use of transfer
learning and data augmentation techniques to ameliorate classification
accuracy. Starting with a convolutional neural network (CNN), a systematic
approach is followed for selecting appropriate splitting ratios and for tuning
multiple training parameters including learning rate schedulers, layers
freezing, batch sizes and loss functions, in the context of the given scenario
which requires classification of waste into different recycling types. Results
are compared and contrasted using 10-fold cross validation and demonstrate that
the model developed achieves a 91.21% test accuracy. Subsequently, a range of
data augmentation techniques are then incorporated into this work including
flipping, rotation, shearing, zooming, and brightness control. Results show
that these augmentation techniques further improve the test accuracy of the
final model to 95.40%. Unlike other work reported in the field, this paper
provides full details regarding the training of the model. Furthermore, the
code for this work has been made open-source and we have demonstrated that the
model can perform successful real-time classification of recycling waste items
using a standard computer webcam.

advances in sensing, computer vision, and machine learning. Various AR/MR
applications demonstrate such capabilities i.e. scanning a space using a
handheld or head mounted device and capturing a digital representation of the
space that are accurate copies of the real space. However, these capabilities
impose privacy risks to users: personally identifiable information can leak
from captured 3D maps of the sensitive spaces and/or captured sensitive objects
within the mapped space. Thus, in this work, we demonstrate how we can leverage
3D object regeneration for preserving privacy of 3D point clouds. That is, we
employ an intermediary layer of protection to transform the 3D point cloud
before providing it to the third-party applications. Specifically, we use an
existing adversarial autoencoder to generate copies of 3D objects where the
likeness of the copies from the original can be varied. To test the viability
and performance of this method as a privacy preserving mechanism, we use a 3D
classifier to classify and identify these transformed point clouds i.e. perform
$\textit{super}$-class and $\textit{intra}$-class classification. To measure
the performance of the proposed privacy framework, we define privacy,
$\Pi\in[0,1]$, and utility metrics, $Q\in[0,1]$, which are desired to be
maximized. Experimental evaluation shows that the privacy framework can indeed
variably effect the privacy of a 3D object by varying the privilege level
$l\in[0,1]$ i.e. if a low $l<0.17$ is maintained, $\Pi_1,\Pi_2>0.4$ is ensured
where $\Pi_1,\Pi_2$ are super- and intra-class privacy. Lastly, the privacy
framework can ensure relatively high intra-class privacy and utility i.e.
$\Pi_2>0.63$ and $Q>0.70$, if the privilege level is kept within the range of
$0.17<l<0.25$.

  Contact Tracing",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, dependence on Contact
Tracing (CT) models has significantly increased to prevent spread of this
highly contagious virus and be prepared for the potential future ones. Since
the spreading probability of the novel coronavirus in indoor environments is
much higher than that of the outdoors, there is an urgent and unmet quest to
develop/design efficient, autonomous, trustworthy, and secure indoor CT
solutions. Despite such an urgency, this field is still in its infancy. The
paper addresses this gap and proposes the Trustworthy Blockchain-enabled system
for Indoor Contact Tracing (TB-ICT) framework. The TB-ICT framework is proposed
to protect privacy and integrity of the underlying CT data from unauthorized
access. More specifically, it is a fully distributed and innovative blockchain
platform exploiting the proposed dynamic Proof of Work (dPoW) credit-based
consensus algorithm coupled with Randomized Hash Window (W-Hash) and dynamic
Proof of Credit (dPoC) mechanisms to differentiate between honest and dishonest
nodes. The TB-ICT not only provides a decentralization in data replication but
also quantifies the node's behavior based on its underlying credit-based
mechanism. For achieving high localization performance, we capitalize on
availability of Internet of Things (IoT) indoor localization infrastructures,
and develop a data driven localization model based on Bluetooth Low Energy
(BLE) sensor measurements. The simulation results show that the proposed TB-ICT
prevents the COVID-19 from spreading by implementation of a highly accurate
contact tracing model while improving the users' privacy and security.

observe acoustic and optical phonon modes localized at the interface, and modes

Using simulations, in which securities lending data is modeled as geometric
brownian motions, we provide a few flavors of creating a ranking of securities
to identity the ones that are heavily shorted.
  An investment strategy of this kind will be ideal in market scenarios when a
downturn happens due to unexpected extreme events and the markets are
anticipated to bounce back thereafter. This situation is especially applicable
to incidents being observed, and relevant proceedings, during the Coronavirus
pandemic in 2020-2021. This strategy is one particular way to overcome a
potential behavioral bias related to investing, which we term the ""rebound
effect"".

previous authors both in Lagrangian and Eulerian form. In this paper we
introduce simpler Eulerian variational principles from which all the relevant
equations of non-barotropic stationary magnetohydrodynamics can be derived for
certain field topologies.
  The variational principle is given in terms of three independent functions
for stationary non-barotropic flows.
  This is a smaller number of variables than the eight variables which appear
in the standard equations of non-barotropic magnetohydrodynamics which are the
magnetic field $\vec B$ the velocity field $\vec v$, the entropy $s$ and the
density $\rho$. We further investigate the case in the flow along magnetic
lines is not ideal.

  Likelihood Grasp Sampling Loss","Accepted to ICRA 2022",,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Robotic grasping for a diverse set of objects is essential in many robot
manipulation tasks. One promising approach is to learn deep grasping models
from large training datasets of object images and grasp labels. However,
empirical grasping datasets are typically sparsely labeled (i.e., a small
number of successful grasp labels in each image). The data sparsity issue can
lead to insufficient supervision and false-negative labels and thus results in
poor learning results. This paper proposes a Maximum Likelihood Grasp Sampling
Loss (MLGSL) to tackle the data sparsity issue. The proposed method supposes
that successful grasps are stochastically sampled from the predicted grasp
distribution and maximizes the observing likelihood. MLGSL is utilized for
training a fully convolutional network that generates thousands of grasps
simultaneously. Training results suggest that models based on MLGSL can learn
to grasp with datasets composing of 2 labels per image. Compared to previous
works, which require training datasets of 16 labels per image, MLGSL is 8x more
data-efficient. Meanwhile, physical robot experiments demonstrate an equivalent
performance at a 90.7% grasp success rate on household objects.
