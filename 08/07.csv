asteroids, the uncertainty of the orbit solution may be compatible with
trajectories that impact Earth. This paper shows how incorporating the impact
condition as an observation in the orbit-determination process results in a
robust technique for finding the regions in parameter space leading to impacts.
The impact pseudo-observation residuals are the b-plane coordinates at the time
of close approach and the uncertainty is set to a fraction of the Earth radius.
The extended orbit-determination filter converges naturally to an impacting
solution if allowed by the observations. The uncertainty of the resulting orbit
provides an excellent geometric representation of the virtual impactor. As a
result, the impact probability can be efficiently estimated by exploring this
region in parameter space using importance sampling. The proposed technique can
systematically handle a large number of estimated parameters, account for
nongravitational forces, deal with nonlinearities, and correct for non-Gaussian
initial uncertainty distributions. The algorithm has been implemented into a
new impact monitoring system at JPL called Sentry-II, which is undergoing
extensive testing. The main advantages of Sentry-II over JPL's currently
operating impact monitoring system Sentry are that Sentry-II can systematically
process orbits perturbed by nongravitational forces and that it is generally
more robust when dealing with pathological cases. The runtimes and completeness
of both systems are comparable, with the impact probability of Sentry-II for
99% completeness being $3\times10^{-7}$.

objective of minimizing the number of used bins. We first define the tangent
occupying action (TOA) and propose a constructive greedy algorithm that
sequentially packs the items into places tangent to the packed items or the bin
boundaries. Moreover, to avoid falling into a local minimum trap and
efficiently judge whether an optimal solution has been established, we continue
to present the adaptive simulated annealing with greedy search (ASA-GS)
algorithm that explores and exploits the search space efficiently.
Specifically, we offer two novel local perturbation strategies to jump out of
the local optimum and incorporate the greedy search to achieve faster
convergence. The parameters of ASA-GS are adaptive according to the number of
items so that they can be size-agnostic across the problem scale. We design two
sets of new benchmark instances, and the empirical results show that ASA-GS
completely outperforms the constructive greedy algorithm. Moreover, the packing
density of ASA-GS on the top few dense bins is much higher than that of the

of the Deviance Information Criterion, we select a reference bias model
dependent on seven parameters that can describe the data up to $k_{\rm

improve the fit while reducing the parameter space. In addition, we compare
common approximations to the covariance matrix against the full covariance
estimated from the mocks, and quantify the (non-negligible) effect of ignoring
the cross-covariance between the two statistics. Finally, we explore different

candidate independent variables from seven categories were extracted using the
web scraping method. Then, sentiment analysis was used to measure the public
attitudes towards AVs by calculating sentiment scores. Random forests algorithm
was employed to preliminarily select candidate independent variables according
to their importance, while a linear mixed model was performed to explore the
impacting factors considering the unobserved heterogeneities caused by the
subjectivity level of tweets. The results showed that the overall attitude of
the public on AVs was slightly optimistic. Factors like ""drunk"", ""blind spot"",
and ""mobility"" had the largest impacts on public attitudes. In addition, people
were more likely to express positive feelings when talking about words such as
""lidar"" and ""Tesla"" that relate to high technologies. Conversely, factors such
as ""COVID-19"", ""pedestrian"", ""sleepy"", and ""highway"" were found to have
significantly negative effects on the public's attitudes. The findings of this
study are beneficial for the development of AV technologies, the guidelines for
AV-related policy formulation, and the public's understanding and acceptance of
AVs.

of this solution, however, crucially depends on the so-called alphaover-beta

  Calibration, Reliability Diagrams, and Coefficient of Determination",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Model diagnostics and forecast evaluation are two sides of the same coin. A
common principle is that fitted or predicted distributions ought to be
calibrated or reliable, ideally in the sense of auto-calibration, where the
outcome is a random draw from the posited distribution. For binary responses,
this is the universal concept of reliability. For real-valued outcomes, a
general theory of calibration has been elusive, despite a recent surge of
interest in distributional regression and machine learning. We develop a
framework rooted in probability theory, which gives rise to hierarchies of
calibration, and applies to both predictive distributions and stand-alone point
forecasts. In a nutshell, a prediction - distributional or single-valued - is
conditionally T-calibrated if it can be taken at face value in terms of the
functional T. Whenever T is defined via an identification function - as in the
cases of threshold (non) exceedance probabilities, quantiles, expectiles, and
moments - auto-calibration implies T-calibration. We introduce population
versions of T-reliability diagrams and revisit a score decomposition into
measures of miscalibration (MCB), discrimination (DSC), and uncertainty (UNC).
In empirical settings, stable and efficient estimators of T-reliability
diagrams and score components arise via nonparametric isotonic regression and
the pool-adjacent-violators algorithm. For in-sample model diagnostics, we
propose a universal coefficient of determination, $$\text{R}^\ast =
\frac{\text{DSC}-\text{MCB}}{\text{UNC}},$$ that nests and reinterprets the
classical $\text{R}^2$ in least squares (mean) regression and its natural
analogue $\text{R}^1$ in quantile regression, yet applies to T-regression in
general, with MCB $\geq 0$, DSC $\geq 0$, and $\text{R}^\ast \in [0,1]$ under
modest conditions.

measure-preserving actions of countable amenable groups. By a~{\em multiorder}
on a~countable group we mean any probability measure $\nu$ on the collection
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}$ of linear orders of type $\mathbb Z$ on $G$, invariant
under the natural action of $G$ on such orders. Every free measure-preserving
$G$-action $(X,\mu,G)$ has a~multiorder $(\tilde{\mathcal{O}},\nu,G)$ as a
factor and has the same orbits as the $\mathbb Z$-action $(X,\mu,S)$, where $S$
is the \emph{successor map} determined by the multiorder factor. Moreover, the
sub-sigma-algebra $\Sigma_{\tilde{\mathcal{O}}}$ associated with the multiorder
factor is invariant under $S$, which makes the corresponding $\mathbb Z$-action
$(\tilde{\mathcal{O}},\nu,\tilde S)$ a factor of $(X,\mu,S)$. We prove that the
entropy of any $G$-process generated by a finite partition of $X$, conditional
with respect to $\Sigma_{\tilde{\mathcal{O}}}$, is preserved by the orbit
equivalence with $(X,\mu,S)$. Furthermore, this entropy can be computed in
terms of the so-called random past, by a formula analogous to $
h(\mu,T,\mathcal P)=H(\mu,\mathcal P|\mathcal{P}^-)$ known for $\mathbb
Z$-actions. The above fact is then applied to prove a variant of a result by
Rudolph and Weiss. The original theorem states that orbit equivalence between
free actions of countable amenable groups preserves conditional entropy with
respect to a~sub-sigma-algebra $\Sigma$, as soon as the ``orbit change'' is
measurable with respect to $\Sigma$. In our variant, we replace the
measurability assumption by a~simpler one: $\Sigma$ should be invariant under
both actions and the actions on the resulting factor should be free. In
conclusion we provide a characterization of the Pinsker sigma-algebra of any
$G$-process in terms of an appropriately defined remote past arising from a
multiorder.

develop a model-based policy gradient algorithm to learn the parameters
directly from the trajectory tracking errors without the need for the ground

the proposed method via both simulation and experiments on quadrotors, where

validation of autonomous vehicles. However, annotation of such trajectories
based only on explicit rules (i.e. knowledge-based methods) may be prone to
errors, such as false positive/negative classification of scenarios that lie on
the border of two scenario classes, missing unknown scenario classes, or even
failing to detect anomalies. On the other hand, verification of labels by
annotators is not cost-efficient. For this purpose, active learning (AL) could
potentially improve the annotation procedure by including an annotator/expert
in an efficient way. In this study, we develop a generic active learning
framework to annotate driving trajectory time series data. We first compute an
embedding of the trajectories into a latent space in order to extract the
temporal nature of the data. Given such an embedding, the framework becomes
task agnostic since active learning can be performed using any classification
method and any query strategy, regardless of the structure of the original time
series data. Furthermore, we utilize our active learning framework to discover
unknown driving scenario trajectories. This will ensure that previously unknown
trajectory types can be effectively detected and included in the labeled
dataset. We evaluate our proposed framework in different settings on novel
real-world datasets consisting of driving trajectories collected by Volvo Cars
Corporation. We observe that active learning constitutes an effective tool for
labelling driving trajectories as well as for detecting unknown classes.
Expectedly, the quality of the embedding plays an important role in the success
of the proposed framework.

high-pressure metallic phase, raising the question concerning its relation with
the low-pressure quantum spin liquid ground state. Here we combine the density
functional theory and the dynamical mean-field theory to explore the underlying
mechanism of the insulator-to-metal transition and superconductivity and
establish an overall picture of its electronic phases under pressure. Our
results suggest that NaYbSe$_2$ is a charge-transfer insulator at ambient
pressure. Upon increasing pressure, however, the system first enters a
semi-metallic state with incoherent Kondo scattering against coexisting
localized Yb-$4f$ moments, and then turns into a heavy fermion metal. In
between, there may exist a delocalization quantum critical point responsible
for the observed non-Fermi liquid region with linear-in-$T$ resistivity. The
insulator-to-metal transition is therefore a two-stage process.
Superconductivity emerges in the heavy fermion phase with well-nested Yb-4$f$
Fermi surfaces, suggesting that spin fluctuations may play a role in the Cooper
pairing. NaYbSe$_2$ might therefore be the 3rd Yb-based heavy-fermion
superconductor with a very ""high"" $T_c$ than most heavy fermion

Measurement Unit (PMU) datastreams with missing entries. The measurements are
first transformed into a Page matrix, and the original signals are
reconstructed using low-rank matrix estimation based on optimal singular value
thresholding. Two variations of the recovery algorithm are shown- a) an offline
block-processing method for imputing past measurements, and b) an online method
for predicting future measurements. Information within a PMU channel (temporal
correlation) as well as from different PMUchannels in a network (spatial
correlation) are utilized to recover degraded data. The proposed method is fast
and needs no explicit knowledge of the underlying system model or measurement
noise distribution. The performance of the recovery algorithms is illustrated
using simulated measurements from the IEEE 39-bus test system as well as real
measurements from an anonymized U.S. electric utility. Extensive numeric tests
show that the original signals can be accurately recovered in the presence of
additive noise, consecutive data drop as well as simultaneous data erasure
across multiple PMU channels.

diverse services (e.g., applications, product groups, customers) despite
failures. Existing traffic engineering (TE) schemes operate at much coarser
granularity than services, which we show necessitates unduly conservative
decisions. To tackle this, we present FloMore, which directly considers the
bandwidth needs of individual services and ensures they are met a desired
percentage of time. Rather than meet the requirements for all services over the
same set of failure states, FloMore exploits a key opportunity that each
service could meet its bandwidth requirements over a different set of failure
states. FloMore consists of an offline phase that identifies the critical
failure states of each service, and on failure allocates traffic in a manner
that prioritizes those services for which that failure state is critical. We
present a novel decomposition scheme to handle FloMore's offline phase in a
tractable manner. Our evaluations show that FloMore outperforms
state-of-the-art TE schemes including SMORE and Teavar, and also out-performs
extensions of these schemes that we devise. The results also show FloMore's
decomposition approach allows it to scale well to larger network topologies.

gas should be expelled in AGN- or starburst-driven outflows. To-date, the
resolved properties of this surviving ISM have remained unknown. We present
high resolution ALMA continuum and CO(2$-$1) observations in six gas- and
dust-rich PSBs, revealing for the first time the spatial and kinematic

reservoirs, with dust and gas surface densities rivaling those found in

disturbances in all sources, with some also displaying disk-like kinematics.
Estimates of the internal turbulent pressure in the gas exceed those of normal
star-forming disks by at least 2 orders of magnitude, and rival the turbulent
gas found in local interacting galaxies, such as the Antennae. Though the
source of this high turbulent pressure remains uncertain, we suggest that the
high incidence of tidal disruption events (TDEs) in PSBs could play a role. The
star formation in these PSBs' turbulent central molecular reservoirs is
suppressed, forming stars only 10% as efficiently as starburst galaxies with
similar gas surface densities. ""The fall"" of star formation in these galaxies

plasma. Diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) and stochastic turbulent
acceleration are known to be the possible mechanisms for producing very high
energetic particles, particularly in weakly magnetized regions. An interplay of
different acceleration processes along with various radiation losses is
typically observed in astrophysical sources. While DSA is a systematic
acceleration process that energizes particles in the vicinity of shocks,
stochastic turbulent acceleration (STA) is a random energizing process, where
the interaction between cosmic ray particles and electromagnetic fluctuations
results in particle acceleration. This process is usually interpreted as a
biased random walk in energy space, modelled through a Fokker-Planck equation.
In the present work, we describe a novel Eulerian algorithm, adopted to
incorporate turbulent acceleration in the presence of DSA and radiative
processes like synchrotron and Inverse-Compton emission. The developed
framework extends the hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian module in a full-fledged
relativistic Magneto-hydrodynamic (RMHD) code PLUTO. From our validation tests
and case studies, we showcase the competing and complementary nature of both
acceleration processes. Axisymmetric simulations of an RMHD jet with this
extended hybrid framework clearly demonstrate that emission due to shocks is
localized while that due to turbulent acceleration originates in the backflow
and is more diffuse, particularly in the high energy X-ray band.

the holographic strategy outlined in arXiv:2012.03999 we construct an open

charged plasma is modeled holographically in terms of a Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS
black hole. We analyze graviton and photon fluctuations about this background,
decoupling in the process the long-lived momentum diffusion mode from the
short-lived charged transport mode. Furthermore, as in the aforementioned
reference, we argue that the dynamics of these modes are captured by a set of
designer scalars in the background geometry. These scalars have their
gravitational coupling modulated by an auxiliary dilaton with long-lived modes
being weakly coupled near the spacetime asymptopia. Aided by these
observations, we obtain the quadratic effective action that governs the
fluctuating hydrodynamics of charge current and stress tensor, reproducing in
the process transport data computed previously. We also point out an
interesting length scale lying between the inner and outer horizon radii of the
charged black hole associated with Ohmic conductivity.

than any TDE observed to date and consistent with many other ANTs. Compared to
an archival X-ray detection, the X-ray luminosity of ASASSN-20hx increased by
an order of magnitude to $L_{x} \sim 1.5 \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and then
slowly declined over time. The X-ray emission is well-fit by a power law with a

energy in a single fluid. Of these models, the standard Chaplygin gas is
theoretically motivated, but faces problems in explaining large scale structure
if linear perturbations are directly imposed on the homogeneous fluid. However,
early formation of a clustered component of small halos is sufficient (and
necessary) for hierarchical clustering to proceed in a CDM-like component as in
the standard scenario, with the remaining homogeneous component acting as dark
energy. We examine this possibility. A linear analysis shows that a critical
Press-Schecter threshold for collapse can generally only be reached for
generalized Chaplygin gas models that mimic $\Lambda$CDM, or ones where
superluminal sound speeds occur. But the standard Chaplygin gas case turns out
to be marginal, with overdensities reaching order one in the linear regime.
This motivates a nonlinear analysis. A simple infall model suggests that
collapse is indeed possible for perturbations of order 1~kpc and above; for, as
opposed to standard gases, pressure forces decrease with increasing densities,
allowing for the collapse of linearly stable systems. This suggests that a
cosmological scenario based on the standard Chaplygin gas may not be ruled out
from the viewpoint of structure formation, as often assumed. On the other hand,
a 'nonlinear Jeans scale', constricting growth to scales $R \gtrsim {\rm kpc}$,
which may be relevant to the small scale problems of CDM, is predicted.
Finally, the background dynamics of clustered Chaplygin gas cosmologies is
examined and confronted with observational datasets. It is found to be viable
(at 1-sigma), with a mildly larger $H_0$ than $\Lambda$CDM, if the clustered
fraction is larger than $90 \%$.

non-trivial automorphisms of the quotient graph $G\setminus{\mathcal T}$,
generalizing an earlier result of Serre. It is known that the ends of
$G\setminus{\mathcal T}$ are in one-one correspondence with the cusps of $G$.
Consequently $Quinn(G)$ acts freely on the ends. In addition $Quinn(G)$ acts
transitively on those ends which are in one-one correspondence with the
vertices of $G\setminus{\mathcal T}$ whose stabilizers are isomorphic to
$GL_2({\mathbb F}_q)$.

The resulting space-time is shown to be unperturbed and isotropic, except for a
discontinuous perturbation on a spherical null shell. Formulae are derived for
the perturbation as a function of polar angle, as measured by an observer at
the origin observing clocks on a sphere at distance $R$. The effect of the

anisotropic, dominated by a quadrupole harmonic aligned with the particle-decay

velocity displacement is isotropic. The solution is used to derive the
gravitational effect of a quantum state with a superposition of a large number
of randomly oriented, statistically isotropic particle decays. This approach is
shown to provide a well-controlled approximation to estimate the magnitude of
gravitational fluctuations in systems composed of null point particles up to
the Planck energy in a causal diamond of duration $\tau= 2R/c$, as well as
quantum-gravitational fluctuations of black holes and cosmological horizons.
Coherent large-angle quantum distortions of macroscopic geometry from

larger than that produced in models without causal quantum coherence.

infinitesimally short exposure times, is more accurate than batch estimation
and, for high-order WFE drift dynamical processes, scales better than batch

scaling laws are a generalization of previously known theoretical and numerical
results for turbulence-driven Adaptive Optics. For space-based coronagraphs, we
propose a scheme for combining models of WFE drift, low-order non-common-path

suggests that the Roman Space Telescope might operate in a regime that is
dominated by incoherent sources rather than WFE drift, where the WFE drift can
be actively rejected throughout the observations with residuals significantly

Full coverage of the 3800-9100 \AA range with 54 narrow and 6 broad optical
filters allow for extremely accurate photo-z, which applied over 1000s of deg^2
will enable new applications of the photo-z technique such as measurement of

characterise the photo-z performance. We build 100 \AA resolution photo-spectra
from the PSF-corrected forced-aperture photometry. Systematic offsets in the
photometry are corrected by applying magnitude shifts obtained through
iterative fitting with stellar population synthesis models. We compute photo-z
with a customised version of LePhare, using a set of templates optimised for
the J-PAS filter-set. We analyse the accuracy of miniJPAS photo-z and their
dependence on multiple quantities using a subsample of 5,266 galaxies with
spectroscopic redshifts from SDSS and DEEP, that we find to be representative
of the whole r<23 miniJPAS sample. Formal uncertainties for the photo-z that
are calculated with the \delta\chi^2 method underestimate the actual redshift
errors. The odds parameter has the stronger correlation with |Dz|, and
accurately reproduces the probability of a redshift outlier (|Dz|>0.03)
irrespective of the magnitude, redshift, or spectral type of the sources. We
show that the two main summary statistics characterising the photo-z accuracy
for a population of galaxies (snmad and \eta) can be predicted by the
distribution of odds in such population, and use this to estimate them for the
whole miniJPAS sample. At r<23 there are 17,500 galaxies/deg^2 with valid
photo-z estimates, of which 4,200 are expected to have |Dz|<0.003 (abridged).

(strict preference order between any two alternatives that are different with
respect to every attribute is preserved around their small neighborhoods) and
an 'unhappy set' (any alternative outside such a set is preferred to all
alternatives inside). Three key aspects of our characterization are: (i) use of
continuity arguments, (ii) the stepwise approach of looking at two attributes
at a time and (iii) in contrast with the previous literature, we do not impose
noncompensation on the preference and consider an alternative weaker condition.

vibration data are overly used in data mining for deep neural networks.
Typically, vibration data is converted into images for classification using
Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and scalograms are the most effective form of
image representation. However, the DNN classifiers require huge labeled
training samples to reach their optimum performance. So, many forms of data
augmentation techniques are applied to the classifiers to compensate for the
lack of training samples. However, the scalograms are graphical representations
where the existing augmentation techniques suffer because they either change
the graphical meaning or have too much noise in the samples that change the
physical meaning. In this study, a data augmentation technique named ensemble
augmentation is proposed to overcome this limitation. This augmentation method
uses the power of white noise added in ensembles to the original samples to
generate real-like samples. After averaging the signal with ensembles, a new
signal is obtained that contains the characteristics of the original signal.
The parameters for the ensemble augmentation are validated using a simulated
signal. The proposed method is evaluated using 10 class bearing vibration data
using three state-of-the-art Transfer Learning (TL) models, namely,
Inception-V3, MobileNet-V2, and ResNet50. Augmented samples are generated in
two increments: the first increment generates the same number of fake samples
as the training samples, and in the second increment, the number of samples is
increased gradually. The outputs from the proposed method are compared with no

a hadron's spatial densities to be obtained. These densities must be
two-dimensional and transverse to a chosen spatial direction. We explore their
relationship to the three-dimensional, non-relativistic densities, with a focus
on densities associated with the energy momentum tensor. The two-dimensional
non-relativistic densities can be obtained from the light front densities
through a non-relativistic limit, and can subsequently be transformed into
three-dimensional non-relativistic densities through an inverse Abel transform.
However, this operation is not invertible, and moreover the application of the
inverse Abel transform to the light front densities does not produce a
physically meaningful result. We additionally find that the Abel transforms of
so-called Breit-frame densities generally differ significantly from the true
light front densities. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the
various differences between the light front, Breit frame, and non-relativistic
treatment of densities.

of the 2012-2015 observing seasons. We set limits on the axion-photon coupling
constant for mass $m$ in the range $10^{-23}$-$10^{-18}~\mathrm{eV}$, which
corresponds to oscillation periods on the order of hours to years. Our results
are consistent with the background model. For periods between $1$ and
$30~\mathrm{d}$ ($1.6 \times 10^{-21} \leq m \leq 4.8 \times

detection and pose estimation. An attractive alternative is to learn control
policies directly from raw input data. However, this approach is time-consuming
and expensive since learning the policy requires many trials with robot actions
in the physical environment. To reduce the training cost, the policy can be
learned in simulation with a large set of synthetic images. The limit of this
approach is the domain gap between the simulation and the robot workspace. In
this paper, we propose to learn a policy for robot reaching movements from a
single image captured directly in the robot workspace from a camera placed on
the end-effector (a hand-eye camera). The idea behind the proposed policy
learner is that view changes seen from the hand-eye camera produced by actions
in the robot workspace are analogous to locating a region-of-interest in a
single image by performing sequential object localisation. This similar view
change enables training of object reaching policies using
reinforcement-learning-based sequential object localisation. To facilitate the
adaptation of the policy to view changes in the robot workspace, we further
present a dynamic filter that learns to bias an input state to remove
irrelevant information for an action decision. The proposed policy learner can
be used as a powerful representation for robotic tasks, and we validate it on
static and moving object reaching tasks.

58 around the WN8h star WR 40 using archival infrared (IR) observations from
WISE and Herschel and radio observations from ATCA. We selected two clumps,
free from contamination from material along the line of sight and located
towards southern regions in RCW 58, as representative of the general properties
of this WR nebula. Their optical, IR and radio properties are then modelled
using the photoionization code Cloudy, which calculates a self-consistent
spatial distribution of dust and gas properties. Two populations of dust grains
are required to model the IR SED: a population of small grains with sizes
0.002-0.01 $\mu$m, which is found throughout the clumps, and a population of
large grains, with sizes up to 0.9 $\mu$m, located further from the star.
Moreover, the clumps have very high dust-to-gas ratios, which present a
challenge for their origin. Our model supports the hypothesis that RCW 58 is
distributed in a ring-like structure rather than a shell, and we estimate a
mass of $\sim$2.5 M$_\odot$. This suggests that the mass of the progenitor of
WR 40 was about $\approx40^{+2}_{-3}$ M$_\odot$. The ring morphology, low
nebular mass, large dust grain size and high dust-to-gas ratio lead us to
propose that RCW 58 has formed through a common envelope channel, similar to
what has been proposed for M 1-67.

to recognize actions from limited examples in non-RGB video modalities, by
learning from large-scale labeled RGB data. To this end, we propose a two-step
training process: (i) we extract action representation knowledge from an
RGB-trained teacher network and adapt it to a non-RGB student network. (ii) we
then fine-tune the transfer model with available labeled examples of the target
modality. For the knowledge transfer we introduce feature-supervision
strategies, which rely on unlabeled pairs of two modalities (the RGB and the
target modality) to transfer feature level representations from the teacher to
the student network. Ablations and generalizations with two RGB source datasets

provides better action transfer features than RGB for both depth maps and

dimensions or the number of clusters is a fundamental and recurring problem.
One common diagnostic is the scree plot, which shows the largest eigenvalues of
the data matrix; the user searches for a ""gap"" or ""elbow"" in the decreasing
eigenvalues; unfortunately, these patterns can hide beneath the bias of the
sample eigenvalues. This methodological problem is conceptually difficult
because, in many situations, there is only enough signal to detect a subset of
the $k$ population dimensions/eigenvectors. In this situation, one could argue
that the correct choice of $k$ is the number of detectable dimensions. We
alleviate these problems with cross-validated eigenvalues. Under a large class
of random graph models, without any parametric assumptions, we provide a
p-value for each sample eigenvector. It tests the null hypothesis that this
sample eigenvector is orthogonal to (i.e., uncorrelated with) the true latent
dimensions. This approach naturally adapts to problems where some dimensions
are not statistically detectable. In scenarios where all $k$ dimensions can be
estimated, we prove that our procedure consistently estimates $k$. In
simulations and a data example, the proposed estimator compares favorably to
alternative approaches in both computational and statistical performance.

results for speaker diarization on highly overlapped speech. However, the
original model requires a fixed (and known) number of speakers, which limits
its application to real conversations. In this paper, we extend TS-VAD to
speaker diarization with unknown numbers of speakers. This is achieved by two
steps: first, an initial diarization system is applied for speaker number
estimation, followed by TS-VAD network output masking according to this
estimate. We further investigate different diarization methods, including
clustering-based and region proposal networks, for estimating the initial
i-vectors. Since these systems have complementary strengths, we propose a
fusion-based method to combine frame-level decisions from the systems for an
improved initialization. We demonstrate through experiments on variants of the
LibriCSS meeting corpus that our proposed approach can improve the DER by up to
50\% relative across varying numbers of speakers. This improvement also results
in better downstream ASR performance approaching that using oracle segments.

quantized over the satellite and topography maps of anticipated flying areas. A

top global matches are retrieved from the database and the vehicle pose is
further refined via local descriptor matching. We present field experiments of

conformal field theories (CFTs).These CFT states are constructed by using
spectrum decomposition of reduced density matrix $\rho_A$ for a subsystem $A$.
For 2 dimensional CFTs we directly construct the bulk metric, which is
consistent with the expected geometry of the fixed area states. For arbitrary
pure geometric state $|\psi\rangle$ in any dimension we also find the
consistency by using the gravity dual of R\'enyi entropy. We also give the
relation of parameters for the bulk and boundary state. The pure geometric
state $|\psi\rangle$ can be expanded as superposition of the fixed area states.
Motivated by this, we propose an area operator $\hat A^\psi$. The fixed area
state is the eigenstate of $\hat A^\psi$, the associated eigenvalue is related
to R\'enyi entropy of subsystem $A$ in this state. The Ryu-Takayanagi formula
can be expressed as the expectation value $\langle \psi| {\hat

effective learning on graph-structured data. Our model exclusively uses global
self-attention as an aggregation mechanism rather than static localized
convolutional aggregation. This allows for unconstrained long-range dynamic
interactions between nodes. Moreover, the edge channels allow the structural
information to evolve from layer to layer, and prediction tasks on edges/links
can be performed directly from the output embeddings of these channels. We
verify the performance of EGT in a wide range of graph-learning experiments on
benchmark datasets, in which it outperforms Convolutional/Message-Passing Graph
Neural Networks. EGT sets a new state-of-the-art for the quantum-chemical

applications, we implement this scheme to the universal preparation of single-

a dynamic representation learning and aligning based model called DySR to
tackle these issues. DySR eliminates the representation gap between services
and requirements by learning a transformation function and obtains service
representations in an evolving social environment through dynamic graph
representation learning. Extensive experiments conducted on a real-world
dataset from ProgrammableWeb show that DySR outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in commonly used evaluation metrics, improving $F1@5$
from $36.1\%$ to $69.3\%$.

operational meaning of ordered disjunction is clear, there exists an important
open issue regarding its semantics. In particular, there does not exist a
purely model-theoretic approach for determining the most preferred models of an

a technique that is not based exclusively on the models of the program and in

model-theoretic semantics for LPODs, which uses an additional truth value in

the proposed approach overcomes the shortcomings of the traditional semantics
of LPODs. Moreover, the new approach can be used to define the semantics of a
natural class of logic programs that can have both ordered and classical

only strict levels of preferences but also alternatives that are equally
preferred. This work is under consideration for acceptance in TPLP.

techniques often involves model updates and deployment. It is unbearable to
re-embedding and re-index with the system suspended when deploying new models.
Therefore, backward-compatible representation is proposed to enable ""new""
features to be compared with ""old"" features directly, which means that the
database is active when there are both ""new"" and ""old"" features in it. Thus we
can scroll-refresh the database or even do nothing on the database to update.
  The existing backward-compatible methods either require a strong overlap
between old and new training data or simply conduct constraints at the instance
level. Thus they are difficult in handling complicated cluster structures and
are limited in eliminating the impact of outliers in old embeddings, resulting
in a risk of damaging the discriminative capability of new features. In this
work, we propose a Neighborhood Consensus Contrastive Learning (NCCL) method.
With no assumptions about the new training data, we estimate the sub-cluster
structures of old embeddings. A new embedding is constrained with multiple old
embeddings in both embedding space and discrimination space at the sub-class
level. The effect of outliers diminished, as the multiple samples serve as
""mean teachers"". Besides, we also propose a scheme to filter the old embeddings
with low credibility, further improving the compatibility robustness. Our
method ensures backward compatibility without impairing the accuracy of the new
model. And it can even improve the new model's accuracy in most scenarios.

The near-field noise is analyzed using Large Eddy Simulation (LES). For this,
we employ a low dispersive and dissipative Finite Volume solver using AUSM for
inviscid fluxes and third order Runge-Kutta method for temporal discretization.
The far-field noise is calculated using a hybrid approach in which the acoustic
sources and mean flow are provided by the fluid solver while the far-field
acoustic pressure is calculated by an acoustic solver. It solves Acoustic
Perturbation Equations using a spectral/hp element method with a Discontinuous
Galerkin projection. The present work highlights many important aspects of
impinging jets. Firstly, the far-field sound with the effect of non-uniform
base-fields is obtained which is important as the far-field acoustic pressure
in most of the literature is reported either without any basefields or by the
application of uniform base-fields. Secondly, a correlation between the
different modes of oscillations of the impinging jet and the production of
impinging tones is studied using Modal Decomposition techniques. This analysis
also sheds some light on the number of concurrent cycles for different nozzle

distance between the plate and the nozzle exit is highlighted using a vortex

synthetic data plus a small amount of real-world data, which makes it difficult
to evaluate the strengths or weaknesses of different reflection removal methods
thoroughly. Furthermore, existing real-world benchmarks and datasets do not
categorize image data based on the types and appearances of reflection (e.g.,
smoothness, intensity), making it hard to analyze reflection removal methods.
Hence, we construct a new reflection removal dataset that is categorized,
diverse, and real-world (CDR). A pipeline based on RAW data is used to capture
perfectly aligned input images and transmission images. The dataset is
constructed using diverse glass types under various environments to ensure
diversity. By analyzing several reflection removal methods and conducting
extensive experiments on our dataset, we show that state-of-the-art reflection
removal methods generally perform well on blurry reflection but fail in
obtaining satisfying performance on other types of real-world reflection. We
believe our dataset can help develop novel methods to remove real-world
reflection better. Our dataset is available at

question in social science research. With the growing availability of
large-scale well-documented academic profiles and career trajectories,
scholarly interest in career success has been reinvigorated, which has emerged
to be an active research domain called the Science of Science (i.e., SciSci).
In this study, we adopt an innovative dynamic perspective to examine how
individual and social factors will influence career success over time. We
propose ACSeeker, an interactive visual analytics approach to explore the
potential factors of success and how the influence of multiple factors changes
at different stages of academic careers. We first applied a Multi-factor Impact
Analysis framework to estimate the effect of different factors on academic
career success over time. We then developed a visual analytics system to
understand the dynamic effects interactively. A novel timeline is designed to
reveal and compare the factor impacts based on the whole population. A
customized career line showing the individual career development is provided to
allow a detailed inspection. To validate the effectiveness and usability of
ACSeeker, we report two case studies and interviews with a social scientist and
general researchers.

application of the general method, we analyze scalar waves scattering off a
nonspinning black hole and demonstrate that the low-frequency expansion of the

adversarial attacks and bypassing the GNNExplainer essentially contradict each

proposing a novel attack framework (GEAttack), which can attack both a GNN

State-of-the-art parallel hash table implementations either make some
simplifying assumptions such as supporting only a subset of hash table
operations or employ optimizations that lead to performance that is highly data
dependent and in the worst case can be similar to a sequential implementation.
In contrast, in this work we develop a dynamic hash table that supports all the
hash table queries - search, insert, delete, update, while allowing us to
support 'p' parallel queries (p>1) per clock cycle via p processing engines
(PEs) in the worst case i.e. the performance is data agnostic. We achieve this
by implementing novel XOR based multi-ported block memories on FPGAs.
Additionally, we develop a technique to optimize the memory requirement of the
hash table if the ratio of search to insert/update/delete queries is known
beforehand. We implement our design on state-of-the-art FPGA devices. Our
design is scalable to 16 PEs and supports throughput up to 5926 MOPS. It
matches the throughput of the state-of-the-art hash table design - FASTHash,

the framework of an ideal two-fluid plasma model. The two-fluid plasma
equations of motion are separated into a base state and a set of linearized
equations governing the evolution of the perturbations. Different coupling
regimes between the charged species are distinguished based on a
non-dimensional Debye length parameter $d_{D,0}$. When $d_{D,0}$ is large, the
coupling between ions and electrons is sufficiently small that the induced
Lorentz force is very weak and the two species evolve as two separate fluids.
When $d_{D,0}$ is small, the coupling is strong and the induced Lorentz force
is strong enough that the difference between state of ions and electrons is
rapidly decreased by the force. As a consequence, the ions and electrons are
tightly coupled and evolve like one fluid. The temporal dynamics is divided
into two phases: an early phase wherein electron precursor waves are prevalent,
and a post ion shock-interface interaction phase during which the RM
instability manifests itself. We also examine the effect of an initially
applied magnetic field in the streamwise direction characterized by the
non-dimensional parameter $\beta_0$. For a short duration after the ion
shock-interface interaction, the growth rate is similar for different initial
magnetic field strengths. As time progresses the suppression of the instability
due to the magnetic field is observed. The growth rate shows oscillations with
a frequency that is related to the ion or electron cyclotron frequency.
  The instability is suppressed due to the vorticity being transported away
from the interface.

length $l_{c}$ of optical second-harmonic (SH) microscopy in such samples, that
are purposely prepared into a wedge shape, in order to elegantly tune the
geometrical confinement from bulk thicknesses down to $\approx$ 50 nm. SH
microscopy is a very powerful and non-invasive tool for the investigation of
structural properties in the biological and solid-state sciences, especially
also for visualizing and analyzing ferroelectric domains and domain walls.
However, unlike bulk LN, SH microscopy in TFLN is largely affected by
interfacial reflections and resonant enhancement that both rely on film
thickness and substrate material. In this paper we show that the dominant SHG
contribution measured in back-reflection, is the co-propagating phase-matched
SH signal and \textit{not} the counter-propagating SH portion as is the case
for bulk LN samples. Moreover, $l_{c}$ dramatically depends also on the
incident pump laser wavelength (sample dispersion) but even more on the
numerical aperture of the focussing objective in use. These experimental
findings on x- and z-cut TFLN are excellently backed up by our advanced
numerical simulations.

adaptive timestepping is presented. Contrary to the Euler-Maruyama scheme in
common non-adaptive BD, we employ an embedded Heun-Euler integrator for the
propagation of the overdamped coupled Langevin equations of motion. This
enables the derivation of a local error estimate and the formulation of
criteria for the acceptance or rejection of trial steps and for the control of
optimal stepsize. Introducing erroneous bias in the random forces is avoided by
Rejection Sampling with Memory (RSwM) due to Rackauckas and Nie, which makes
use of the Brownian bridge theorem and guarantees the correct generation of a
specified random process even when rejecting trial steps. For test cases of
Lennard-Jones fluids in bulk and in confinement, it is shown that adaptive BD
solves performance and stability issues of conventional BD, already
outperforming the latter even in standard situations. We expect this novel
computational approach to BD to be especially helpful in long-time simulations
of complex systems, e.g. in non-equilibrium, where concurrent slow and fast
processes occur.

approaches mainly focus on static graphs. However, many graphs change over time
with their edge may disappear, or node/edge attribute may alter from one time

learning of nodes in time varying graphs. In this paper, we propose a Temporal
Multi-layered Position-aware Graph Neural Network (TMP-GNN), a node embedding
approach for dynamic graph that incorporates the interdependence of temporal
relations into embedding computation. We evaluate the performance of TMP-GNN on
two different representations of temporal multilayered graphs. The performance
is assessed against the most popular GNNs on node-level prediction tasks. Then,
we incorporate TMP-GNN into a deep learning framework to estimate missing data
and compare the performance with their corresponding competent GNNs from our
former experiment, and a baseline method. Experimental results on four
real-world datasets yield up to 58% of lower ROC AUC for pairwise node

particularly for graphs with a relatively high number of nodes and lower mean

consists on short and noisy trajectories, which are hard to characterize with
usual statistical approaches. In recent years, we have witnessed an impressive
effort to bridge theory and experiments by means of supervised machine learning
techniques, with astonishing results. In this work, we explore the use of
unsupervised methods in anomalous diffusion data. We show that the main
diffusion characteristics can be learnt without the need of any labelling of

restricts the amount of information to reach visual awareness for perceiving
natural scenes, allowing near real-time information processing with limited
computational capacity [Koch and Ullman, 1987]. This kind of selectivity acts
as an 'Information Bottleneck (IB)', which seeks a trade-off between
information compression and predictive accuracy. However, such information
constraints are rarely explored in the attention mechanism for deep neural
networks (DNNs). In this paper, we propose an IB-inspired spatial attention
module for DNN structures built for visual recognition. The module takes as
input an intermediate representation of the input image, and outputs a
variational 2D attention map that minimizes the mutual information (MI) between
the attention-modulated representation and the input, while maximizing the MI
between the attention-modulated representation and the task label. To further
restrict the information bypassed by the attention map, we quantize the
continuous attention scores to a set of learnable anchor values during
training. Extensive experiments show that the proposed IB-inspired spatial
attention mechanism can yield attention maps that neatly highlight the regions
of interest while suppressing backgrounds, and bootstrap standard DNN
structures for visual recognition tasks (e.g., image classification,
fine-grained recognition, cross-domain classification). The attention maps are
interpretable for the decision making of the DNNs as verified in the

potential decays with distance as a power-law, controlled by an exponent
$\delta \geq 0$. For such a non-integrable model, one of the recent results
that has captured quite some attention is the puzzling ballistic-like transport
observed for $\delta = 2$, reminiscent of integrable systems. Here, we first
employ the reverse nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to look
closely at the $\delta = 2$ transport in three long-ranged models, and point
out a few problematic issues with this simulation method. Next, we examine the
process of energy relaxation, and find that relaxation can be appreciably slow
for $\delta = 2$ in some situations. We invoke the concept of nonlinear
localized modes of excitation, also known as discrete breathers, and
demonstrate that the slow relaxation and the ballistic-like transport
properties can be consistently explained in terms of a novel depinning of the
discrete breathers that makes them highly mobile at $\delta = 2$. Finally, in
the presence of quartic pinning potentials we find that the long-ranged model
exhibits Fourier (diffusive) transport at $\delta = 2$, as one would expect
from short-ranged interacting systems with broken momentum conservation. Such a
diffusive regime is not observed for harmonic pinning.

expression, pose, and face styling. Therefore, it is a great challenge to
disentangle and extract these characteristics from facial images, especially in
an unsupervised manner. In this work, we introduce cycle-consistency in facial
characteristics as free supervisory signal to learn facial representations from
unlabeled facial images. The learning is realized by superimposing the facial
motion cycle-consistency and identity cycle-consistency constraints. The main
idea of the facial motion cycle-consistency is that, given a face with
expression, we can perform de-expression to a neutral face via the removal of
facial motion and further perform re-expression to reconstruct back to the
original face. The main idea of the identity cycle-consistency is to exploit
both de-identity into mean face by depriving the given neutral face of its
identity via feature re-normalization and re-identity into neutral face by
adding the personal attributes to the mean face. At training time, our model
learns to disentangle two distinct facial representations to be useful for
performing cycle-consistent face reconstruction. At test time, we use the
linear protocol scheme for evaluating facial representations on various tasks,
including facial expression recognition and head pose regression. We also can
directly apply the learnt facial representations to person recognition,
frontalization and image-to-image translation. Our experiments show that the
results of our approach is competitive with those of existing methods,
demonstrating the rich and unique information embedded in the disentangled
representations. Code is available at https://github.com/JiaRenChang/FaceCycle .

transformers (ViT) for image recognition. First, fixing the number of tokens
through the whole network produces redundant features at the spatial level.
Second, the attention maps among different transformer layers are redundant.
Based on the observations above, we propose a PSViT: a ViT with token Pooling
and attention Sharing to reduce the redundancy, effectively enhancing the
feature representation ability, and achieving a better speed-accuracy
trade-off. Specifically, in our PSViT, token pooling can be defined as the
operation that decreases the number of tokens at the spatial level. Besides,
attention sharing will be built between the neighboring transformer layers for
reusing the attention maps having a strong correlation among adjacent layers.
Then, a compact set of the possible combinations for different token pooling
and attention sharing mechanisms are constructed. Based on the proposed compact
set, the number of tokens in each layer and the choices of layers sharing
attention can be treated as hyper-parameters that are learned from data
automatically. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme can achieve

computationally efficient and applicable for both low-shot supervised and

Concluding Report are (1) to reveal the core position of energy viewpoint in
the realm of electromagnetic modal analysis; (2) to show how to do
energy-viewpoint-based modal analysis for various electromagnetic structures.
The major conclusions of this report are that: energy conservation law governs
the energy utilization processes of various electromagnetic structures, and its
energy source term sustains the steady energy utilization processes; the whole
modal space of an electromagnetic structure is spanned by a series of
energy-decoupled modes (DMs), which don't have net energy exchange in any
integral period; the DMs can be effectively constructed by orthogonalizing
energy source operator, which is just the operator form of the energy source
term. Specifically speaking: in classical electromagnetism, energy conservation
law has five different manifestation forms, that are power transport theorem
(PTT), partial-structure-oriented work-energy theorem (PS-WET),
entire-structure-oriented work-energy theorem (ES-WET), Poynting's theorem
(PtT), and Lorentz's reciprocity theorem (LRT) forms; the energy source terms
in the first four forms are formulated as input power operator (IPO),
partial-structure-oriented driving power operator (PS-DPO),
entire-structure-oriented driving power operator (ES-DPO), and Poynting's flux
operator (PtFO); the DMs of wave-port-fed, lumped-port-driven,
externally-incident-field-driven, and energy-dissipating/self-oscillating
electromagnetic structures can be constructed by orthogonalizing IPO, PS-DPO,
ES-DPO, and PtFO; LRT guarantees that the obtained DMs satisfy some useful
Em-Hn orthogonality relations, where the Em and Hn represent the electric field
of the m-th DM and the magnetic field of the n-th DM.

and popular approach for various computer vision tasks. The common practice of
fine-tuning is to adopt a default hyperparameter setting with a fixed
pre-trained model, while both of them are not optimized for specific tasks and
time constraints. Moreover, in cloud computing or GPU clusters where the tasks
arrive sequentially in a stream, faster online fine-tuning is a more desired
and realistic strategy for saving money, energy consumption, and CO2 emission.
In this paper, we propose a joint Neural Architecture Search and Online
Adaption framework named NASOA towards a faster task-oriented fine-tuning upon
the request of users. Specifically, NASOA first adopts an offline NAS to
identify a group of training-efficient networks to form a pretrained model zoo.
We propose a novel joint block and macro-level search space to enable a
flexible and efficient search. Then, by estimating fine-tuning performance via
an adaptive model by accumulating experience from the past tasks, an online
schedule generator is proposed to pick up the most suitable model and generate
a personalized training regime with respect to each desired task in a one-shot
fashion. The resulting model zoo is more training efficient than SOTA models,
e.g. 6x faster than RegNetY-16GF, and 1.7x faster than EfficientNetB3.
Experiments on multiple datasets also show that NASOA achieves much better
fine-tuning results, i.e. improving around 2.1% accuracy than the best
performance in RegNet series under various constraints and tasks; 40x faster
compared to the BOHB.

  These transition matrices allow us to obtain a hierarchy of integrals of

shared with a central site, requiring improved security solutions. In this
work, we propose a framework for secure FL using fully-homomorphic encryption
(FHE). Specifically, we use the CKKS construction, an approximate, floating
point compatible scheme that benefits from ciphertext packing and rescaling. In
our evaluation on large-scale brain MRI datasets, we use our proposed secure FL
framework to train a deep learning model to predict a person's age from
distributed MRI scans, a common benchmarking task, and demonstrate that there
is no degradation in the learning performance between the encrypted and
non-encrypted federated models.

interactions of individual users in a number of everyday activities and
applications. As a result, the analysis of such networks has attracted lots of
attention in the literature. Among the topics of interest, a key problem
relates to identifying so-called influential users for a number of
applications, which need to spread messages. Several approaches have been
proposed to estimate users' influence and identify sets of influential users in
social networks. A common basis of these approaches is to consider links
between users, that is, structural or topological properties of the network. To
a lesser extent, some approaches take into account users' behaviours or
attitudes. Although a number of surveys have reviewed approaches based on
structural properties of social networks, there has been no comprehensive
review of approaches that take into account users' behaviour. This paper
attempts to cover this gap by reviewing and proposing a taxonomy of such
behaviour-aware methods to identify influential users in social networks.

  Re-identification","ICCV 2021",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  In this work, we address the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation for
person re-ID where annotations are available for the source domain but not for
target. Previous methods typically follow a two-stage optimization pipeline,
where the network is first pre-trained on source and then fine-tuned on target
with pseudo labels created by feature clustering. Such methods sustain two main
limitations. (1) The label noise may hinder the learning of discriminative
features for recognizing target classes. (2) The domain gap may hinder
knowledge transferring from source to target. We propose three types of
technical schemes to alleviate these issues. First, we propose a cluster-wise
contrastive learning algorithm (CCL) by iterative optimization of feature
learning and cluster refinery to learn noise-tolerant representations in the
unsupervised manner. Second, we adopt a progressive domain adaptation (PDA)
strategy to gradually mitigate the domain gap between source and target data.
Third, we propose Fourier augmentation (FA) for further maximizing the class
separability of re-ID models by imposing extra constraints in the Fourier
space. We observe that these proposed schemes are capable of facilitating the
learning of discriminative feature representations. Experiments demonstrate
that our method consistently achieves notable improvements over the
state-of-the-art unsupervised re-ID methods on multiple benchmarks, e.g.,
surpassing MMT largely by 8.1\%, 9.9\%, 11.4\% and 11.1\% mAP on the

  Rank Recommendation",,,,,"cs.IR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Exposure bias is a well-known issue in recommender systems where items and
suppliers are not equally represented in the recommendation results. This is
especially problematic when bias is amplified over time as a few popular items
are repeatedly over-represented in recommendation lists. This phenomenon can be
viewed as a recommendation feedback loop: the system repeatedly recommends
certain items at different time points and interactions of users with those
items will amplify bias towards those items over time. This issue has been
extensively studied in the literature on model-based or neighborhood-based
recommendation algorithms, but less work has been done on online recommendation
models such as those based on multi-armed Bandit algorithms. In this paper, we
study exposure bias in a class of well-known bandit algorithms known as Linear
Cascade Bandits. We analyze these algorithms on their ability to handle
exposure bias and provide a fair representation for items and suppliers in the
recommendation results. Our analysis reveals that these algorithms fail to
treat items and suppliers fairly and do not sufficiently explore the item space
for each user. To mitigate this bias, we propose a discounting factor and
incorporate it into these algorithms that controls the exposure of items at
each time step. To show the effectiveness of the proposed discounting factor on
mitigating exposure bias, we perform experiments on two datasets using three
cascading bandit algorithms and our experimental results show that the proposed
method improves the exposure fairness for items and suppliers.

descent to the integrated density on the hyperplane with respect to a
convolution of the underlying distribution and a smoothing kernel. In the case
where the bandwidth of the smoothing kernel is decreased towards zero, the bias
of these updates with respect to the true underlying density tends to zero, and
convergence to a minimiser of the density on the hyperplane can be obtained. A
post-processing of the partition induced by a collection of low-density
hyperplanes yields an efficient and accurate clustering method which is capable
of automatically selecting an appropriate number of clusters. Experiments with
the proposed approach show that it is highly competitive in terms of both speed

equivariant covers of nilpotent co-adjoint $G$-orbits. To each such cover
$\tilde{\mathbb{O}}$, we attach a distinguished filtered algebra

$\mathrm{gr}(\mathcal{A}_0)\simeq \mathbb{C}[\tilde{\mathbb{O}}]$. The algebra
$\mathcal{A}_0$ receives a distinguished homomorphism from the universal
enveloping algebra $U(\mathfrak{g})$, and the kernel of this homomorphism is a
completely prime primitive ideal in $U(\mathfrak{g})$ with associated variety
$\overline{\mathbb{O}}$. A unipotent ideal is any ideal in $U(\mathfrak{g})$
which arises in this fashion. A unipotent representation is an irreducible
Harish-Chandra bimodule which is annihilated (on both sides) by such an ideal.
  Our unipotent ideals and representations have all of the expected properties:
the unipotent representations attached to $\tilde{\mathbb{O}}$ are
parameterized by irreducible representations of a certain finite group
(generalizing Lusztig's canonical quotient) and, when restricted to $K$, are of
the form conjectured by Vogan. In classical types, all unipotent ideals are
maximal, and all unipotent representations are unitary (we expect these
properties to hold for arbitrary groups). Finally, all special unipotent
representations are unipotent. To prove the last assertion, we introduce a
refinement of Barbasch-Vogan-Lusztig-Spaltenstein duality, inspired by the
symplectic duality of Braden, Licata, Proudfoot, and Webster.

weak cosmic censorship conjecture (WCCC) in Kerr-Newmann black holes. However,
their discussion only includes the second-order approximation of perturbation
and there exists an optimal condition such that the validity of the WCCC is
determined by the higher-order approximations. Therefore, in this paper, we
extended their discussions into the high-order approximations to study the WCCC
in a nearly extremal Kerr black hole. After assuming that the spacetime
satisfies the stability condition and the perturbation matter fields satisfy
the null energy condition, based on the Noether charge method by Iyer and Wald,
we completely calculate the first four order perturbation inequalities and
discuss the corresponding gedanken experiment to overspin the Kerr black hole.
As a result, we find that the nearly extremal Kerr black holes cannot be
destroyed under the fourth-order approximation of perturbation. Then, by using
the mathematical induction, we strictly prove the $n$th order perturbation
inequality when the first $(n-1)$ order perturbation inequalities are
saturated. Using these results, we discuss the first $100$ order approximation
of the gedanken experiments and find that the WCCC in Kerr black hole is valid
under the higher-order approximation of perturbation. Our investigation implies
that the WCCC might be strictly satisfied in Kerr black holes under the
perturbation level.

The key inductive biases are vector-quantization for pitch representation and
pitch-transformation invariant for timbre representation. In addition, we
adopted a query-by-example method to achieve \textit{zero-shot} learning, i.e.,
the model is capable of doing source separation, transcription, and synthesis
for \textit{unseen} instruments. The current design focuses on audio mixtures
of two monophonic instruments. Experimental results show that our model
outperforms existing multi-task baselines, and the transcribed score serves as
a powerful auxiliary for separation tasks.

scientific topics to research and endless production of literature in them.
Just like X-ray imaging in medicine, can we intuitively identify the
development limit and internal evolution pattern of scientific topic from the
relationship of massive knowledge? To answer this question, we collect 71431
seminal articles of topics that cover 16 disciplines and their citation data,
and extracts the ""idea tree"" of each topic to restore the structure of the
development of 71431 topic networks from scratch. We define the Knowledge
Entropy (KE) metric, and the contribution of high knowledge entropy nodes to
increase the depth of the idea tree is regarded as the basis for topic
development. By observing ""X-ray images"" of topics, We find two interesting
phenomena: (1) Even though the scale of topics may increase unlimitedly, there
is an insurmountable cap of topic development: the depth of the idea tree does
not exceed 6 jumps, which coincides with the classical ""Six Degrees of
Separation""! (2) It is difficult for a single article to contribute more than 3
jumps to the depth of its topic, to this end, the continuing increase in the
depth of the idea tree needs to be motivated by the influence relay of multiple
high knowledge entropy nodes. Through substantial statistical fits, we derive a
unified quantitative relationship between the change in topic depth ${\Delta
D}^t(v)$ and the change in knowledge entropy over time ${KE}^t\left(v\right)$
of the article $v$ driving the increase in depth in the topic: ${\Delta D}^t(v)
\approx \log \frac{KE^{t}(v)}{\left(t-t_{0}\right)^{1.8803}}$ , which can
effectively portray evolution patterns of topics and predict their development
potential. The various phenomena found by scientific x-ray may provide a new
paradigm for explaining and understanding the evolution of science and

constructed by the blending of a shadow image and a shadow-free image. We

the enumeration of all (optimal) answer sets. However, in this work, we
generalize the enumeration of optimal answer sets beyond strictly optimal ones,

network (GAN). Our contribution uses coarse and widely available geospatial
data to create maps of less available features at the finer scale in the built
environment, bypassing their traditional acquisition techniques (e.g. satellite
imagery or land surveying). In the work, we employ land use data and road
networks as input to generate building footprints and conduct experiments in 9
cities around the world. The method, which we implement in a tool we release
openly, enables the translation of one geospatial dataset to another with high
fidelity and morphological accuracy. It may be especially useful in locations
missing detailed and high-resolution data and those that are mapped with
uncertain or heterogeneous quality, such as much of OpenStreetMap. The quality
of the results is influenced by the urban form and scale. In most cases, the
experiments suggest promising performance as the method tends to truthfully
indicate the locations, amount, and shape of buildings. The work has the
potential to support several applications, such as energy, climate, and urban
morphology studies in areas previously lacking required data or inpainting
geospatial data in regions with incomplete data.

  mathematical optimization",,,,,"cs.OH math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of maximizing the number of people that a dining room
can accommodate provided that the chairs belonging to different tables are
socially distant. We introduce an optimization model that incorporates several
characteristics of the problem, namely: the type and size of surface of the
dining room, the shapes and sizes of the tables, the positions of the chairs,
the sitting sense of the customers, and the possibility of adding space
separators to increase the capacity. We propose a simple, yet general,
set-packing formulation for the problem. We investigate the efficiency of space
separators and the impact of considering the sitting sense of customers in the
room capacity. We also perform an algorithmic analysis of the model, and assess
its scalability to the problem size, the presence of (or lack thereof) room
separators, and the consideration of the sitting sense of customers. We also
propose two constructive heuristics capable of coping with large problem
instances otherwise intractable for the optimization model.

  for Self-Supervised Speech Pre-Training",,,,,"cs.LG cs.SD eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motivated by the success of masked language modeling~(MLM) in pre-training
natural language processing models, we propose w2v-BERT that explores MLM for
self-supervised speech representation learning. w2v-BERT is a framework that
combines contrastive learning and MLM, where the former trains the model to
discretize input continuous speech signals into a finite set of discriminative
speech tokens, and the latter trains the model to learn contextualized speech
representations via solving a masked prediction task consuming the discretized
tokens. In contrast to existing MLM-based speech pre-training frameworks such
as HuBERT, which relies on an iterative re-clustering and re-training process,
or vq-wav2vec, which concatenates two separately trained modules, w2v-BERT can
be optimized in an end-to-end fashion by solving the two self-supervised
tasks~(the contrastive task and MLM) simultaneously. Our experiments show that
w2v-BERT achieves competitive results compared to current state-of-the-art
pre-trained models on the LibriSpeech benchmarks when using the Libri-Light~60k
corpus as the unsupervised data. In particular, when compared to published
models such as conformer-based wav2vec~2.0 and HuBERT, our model shows~5\%
to~10\% relative WER reduction on the test-clean and test-other subsets. When
applied to the Google's Voice Search traffic dataset, w2v-BERT outperforms our
internal conformer-based wav2vec~2.0 by more than~30\% relatively.

such a process. We also contrast this behavior with others produced via a
symbolic dynamics applied on standard noise sources as well as deterministic
sequences produced by simple automata. Our findings include the well known,
Morse-Thue sequence as the simplest model exhibiting such behavior apart from
some strongly biased Levy walks.

out ever-increasing complex operations that are time-critical and that require
accurate localization performance (e.g., tracking the state of a malicious
user). Since there is the need to preserve low UAV complexity while tackling
the challenging goals of missions in effective ways, one key aspect is the UAV
intelligence (UAV-I). The UAV's intelligence includes the UAV's capability to
process information and to make decisions, e.g., to decide where to sense and
whether to delegate some tasks to other network entities. In this paper, we
provide an overview of possible solutions for the design of UAVs of low
complexity, showing some of the needs of the UAVs for running efficient
localization operations, performed either as a team or individually. Further,
we focus on different network configurations, which possibly include assistance
with edge computing. We also discuss open problems and future perspectives for
these settings.

  admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2105.09284","ACL-2021",,,"cs.CV cs.CL cs.LG cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Propaganda can be defined as a form of communication that aims to influence
the opinions or the actions of people towards a specific goal; this is achieved
by means of well-defined rhetorical and psychological devices. Propaganda, in
the form we know it today, can be dated back to the beginning of the 17th
century. However, it is with the advent of the Internet and the social media
that it has started to spread on a much larger scale than before, thus becoming
major societal and political issue. Nowadays, a large fraction of propaganda in
social media is multimodal, mixing textual with visual content. With this in
mind, here we propose a new multi-label multimodal task: detecting the type of
propaganda techniques used in memes. We further create and release a new corpus
of 950 memes, carefully annotated with 22 propaganda techniques, which can
appear in the text, in the image, or in both. Our analysis of the corpus shows
that understanding both modalities together is essential for detecting these
techniques. This is further confirmed in our experiments with several
state-of-the-art multimodal models.
