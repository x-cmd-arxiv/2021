precision and high density. Efficient classification of wood points and leaf
points is essential to study tree structural parameters and ecological

three-step classification and verification method was proposed to achieve
automated wood-leaf classification. Tree point cloud was classified into wood
points and leaf points by using intensity threshold, neighborhood density and
voxelization successively. Experiment was carried in Haidian Park, Beijing, and
24 trees were scanned by using the RIEGL VZ-400 scanner. The tree point clouds
were processed by using the proposed method, whose classification results were
compared with the manual classification results which were used as standard
results. To evaluate the classification accuracy, three indicators were used in
the experiment, which are Overall Accuracy (OA), Kappa coefficient (Kappa) and
Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC). The ranges of OA, Kappa and MCC of the
proposed method are from 0.9167 to 0.9872, from 0.7276 to 0.9191, and from
0.7544 to 0.9211 respectively. The average values of OA, Kappa and MCC are
0.9550, 0.8547 and 0.8627 respectively. Time cost of wood-leaf classification
was also recorded to evaluate the algorithm efficiency. The average processing
time are 1.4 seconds per million points. The results showed that the proposed
method performed well automatically and quickly on wood-leaf classification
based on the experimental dataset.

dispatch and a real-time re-dispatch. The former must be conducted facing an
uncertain net demand that includes non-dispatchable electricity consumption and
renewable power generation. The latter copes with the plausible deviations with
respect to the forward schedule by making use of balancing power during the
actual operation of the system. Standard industry practice deals with the
uncertain net demand in the forward stage by replacing it with a good estimate
of its conditional expectation (usually referred to as a point forecast), so as
to minimize the need for balancing power in real time. However, it is well
known that the cost structure of a power system is highly asymmetric and
dependent on its operating point, with the result that minimizing the amount of
power imbalances is not necessarily aligned with minimizing operating costs. In
this paper, we propose a bilevel program to construct, from the available
historical data, a prescription of the net demand that does account for the
power system's cost asymmetry. Furthermore, to accommodate the strong
dependence of this cost on the power system's operating point, we use
clustering to tailor the proposed prescription to the foreseen net-demand
regime. By way of an illustrative example and a more realistic case study based
on the European power system, we show that our approach leads to substantial
cost savings compared to the customary way of doing.

reducing the hardware overhead required for fault-tolerant quantum information

can be characterized by their phase-space rotation symmetry. However, their
performance has been examined to date only within an idealistic noise model.
Here, we further analyze the error-correction capabilities of
rotation-symmetric codes using a teleportation-based error-correction circuit.
To this end, we numerically compute the average gate fidelity, including
measurement errors into the noise model of the data qubit. Focusing on physical
measurement models, we assess the performance of heterodyne and adaptive
homodyne detection in comparison to the previously studied canonical phase
measurement. This setting allows us to shed light on the role of different
currently available measurement schemes when decoding the encoded information.
We find that with the currently achievable measurement efficiencies in
microwave optics, bosonic rotation codes undergo a substantial decrease in
their break-even potential. In addition, we perform a detailed analysis of
Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes using a similar error-correction circuit
that allows us to analyze the effect of realistic measurement models on
different codes. In comparison to RSB codes, we find for GKP codes an even

We aimed at exploring practitioners' understanding about the relationships
between SA and SC. Method: We used a mixed-method that combines an online
survey with 87 respondents and an interview with 8 participants to collect the
views of practitioners from 37 countries about the relationships between SA and
SC. Results: Our results reveal that: practitioners mainly discuss five
features of relationships between SA and SC; a few practitioners have adopted
dedicated approaches and tools in the literature for identifying and analyzing
the relationships between SA and SC despite recognizing the importance of such
information for improving a system's quality attributes, especially

impediments that prevent practitioners from identifying, analyzing, and using

identified five features of relationships between SA and SC reported in the

manage the five features of relationships should be developed with dedicated

data classification. Due to the increasing development of technologies

the curse of dimensionality of the feature set of the data classification
problem. In solving the data classification problems, when the feature set is
too large, typical approaches will not be able to solve the problem. In this
case, an approach can be used to partition the feature set into multiple
feature sub-sets so that the data classification problem is solved for each of
the feature subsets and finally using the ensemble classification, the
classification is applied to the entire feature set. In the above-mentioned
approach, the partitioning of feature set into feature sub-sets is still an
interesting area in the literature of this field. In this research, an
innovative framework for multi-view ensemble classification, inspired by the
problem of object recognition in the multiple views theory of humans, is
proposed. In this method, at first, the collaboration values between the
features is calculated using a criterion called the features collaboration
criterion. Then, the collaboration graph is formed based on the calculated
collaboration values. In the next step, using the community detection method,
graph communities are found. The communities are considered as the problem
views and the different base classifiers are trained for different views using
the views corresponding training data. The multi-view ensemble classifier is
then formed by a combination of base classifiers based on the AdaBoost
algorithm. The simulation results of the proposed method on the real and

the demand of model reduction and hardware acceleration for low-power GCNs
action recognition application becomes continuously higher.
  To address challenges above, this paper proposes a runtime sparse feature
compress accelerator with hybrid pruning method: RFC-HyPGCN. First, this method
skips both graph and spatial convolution workloads by reorganizing the
multiplication order. Following spatial convolution workloads channel-pruning
dataflow, a coarse-grained pruning method on temporal filters is designed,
together with sampling-like fine-grained pruning on time dimension. Later, we
come up with an architecture where all convolutional layers are mapped on chip
to pursue high throughput. To further reduce storage resource utilization,
online sparse feature compress format is put forward. Features are divided and
encoded into several banks according to presented format, then bank storage is
split into depth-variable mini-banks. Furthermore, this work applies
quantization, input-skipping and intra-PE dynamic data scheduling to accelerate
the model. In experiments, proposed pruning method is conducted on 2s-AGCN,

online planning and scheduling for autonomous vehicles in off-road situations.
Mainly, we focus on typical problems of interest which include computing
itineraries that meet certain objectives, as well as computing scheduling
strategies to execute synchronized maneuvers with other vehicles. We present a
range of learning-based heuristics to assist different itinerary planners. We
show that these heuristics allow a significant increase in performance for
optimal planners. Furthermore, in the case of approximate planning, we show
that not only does the running time decrease, the quality of the itinerary
found also becomes almost always better. Finally, in order to synthesize
strategies to execute synchronized maneuvers, we propose a novel type of
scheduling controllability and a learning-assisted algorithm. The proposed
framework achieves significant improvement on known benchmarks in this
controllability type over the performance of state-of-the-art works in a
related controllability type. Moreover, it is able to find strategies on
complex scheduling problems for which previous works fail to do so.

all-to-all two-spin interactions via the collective modes of motion through
Cirac-Zoller or Molmer-Sorensen schemes, leading to effective two-spin
Hamiltonians, as well as two-qubit entangling gates. In this work, the
Molmer-Sorensen scheme is extended to induce three-spin interactions via
tailored first- and second-order spin-motion couplings. The scheme enables
engineering single-, two-, and three-spin interactions, and can be tuned via an
enhanced protocol to simulate purely three-spin dynamics. Analytical results
for the effective evolution are presented, along with detailed numerical
simulations of the full dynamics to support the accuracy and feasibility of the
proposed scheme for near-term applications. With a focus on quantum simulation,
the advantage of a direct analog implementation of three-spin dynamics is
demonstrated via the example of matter-gauge interactions in the U(1) lattice
gauge theory within the quantum link model. The mapping of degrees of freedom
and strategies for scaling the three-spin scheme to larger systems, are
detailed, along with a discussion of the expected outcome of the simulation of
the quantum link model given realistic fidelities in the upcoming experiments.
The applications of the three-spin scheme go beyond the lattice gauge theory
example studied here and include studies of static and dynamical phase diagrams
of strongly interacting condensed-matter systems modeled by two- and three-spin
Hamiltonians.

atoms are of fundamental importance for studies of ultracold atom physics. For
many systems, one can efficiently calculate these quantities via the zero-range
Huang-Yang pseudopotential (HYP), in which the interatomic interaction is
characterized by the scattering length $a$. Furthermore, when the scattering
length is dependent on the kinetic energy $\varepsilon_{\rm r}$ of two-atom
relative motion, the results are applicable for a broad energy region. However,
when the free Hamiltonian of atomic internal state does not commute with the
inter-atomic interaction, or the center-of-mass (c.m.) motion is coupled to the
relative motion, the generalization of this technique is still lacking. We
solve this problem and construct a reasonable energy-dependent multi-channel
HYP, which is characterized by a ""scattering length operator"" ${\hat a}_{\rm
eff}$. Here ${\hat a}_{\rm eff}$ is an operator for atomic internal states and
c.m. motion, and depends on both the total two-atom energy and the external
field as well as the trapping parameter. The effects from the internal-state or
c.m.-relative motion coupling can be self-consistently taken into account by
${\hat a}_{\rm eff}$. We further show a method based on the quantum defect
theory, with which ${\hat a}_{\rm eff}$ can be analytically derived for systems
with van der Waals inter-atomic interaction. To demonstrate our method, we
calculate the spectrum of two ultracold fermionic alkaline-earth-like atoms
confined in an optical lattice. By comparing our results with the recent
experimental measurements for two Yb173 atoms and two Yb171 atoms, we calibrate
the scattering lengths $a_{\pm}$ with respect to anti-symmetric and symmetric
nuclear-spin states to be $a_{+}=2012(19)a_{0}$ and $a_{-}=193(4)a_{0}$ for

from substructures in the jet outside of the broad-line region (BLR). We
address the spectral signature imprinted by atomic emission lines on the

field of the BLR. We determine with high precision the gamma-ray SED of 3C 279
using Fermi Large Area Telescope data from MJD 58129 - 58150 and simulate the
pair cascade spectrum for three different injection terms. Satisfactory fits to
the observational data are obtained. The obtained SED shows features imprinted
by pair production on atomic emission line photons due to optically thick
radiation transport, but lacking further exponential attenuation expected if
the emission region would lie buried deep within the BLR. The SED of 3C 279 is
consistent with an inverse-Compton pair cascade spectrum without exponential
external pair absorption. Our findings support the view that the gamma-ray
emission in 3C 279 originates from the edge of the BLR.

scheme. We demonstrate the advantages of our methods for noisy quantum
computers by classifying images with the IBM quantum computer. To achieve
further speedups we distribute the quantum computational tasks between
different quantum computers. Our method enables benchmarking of quantum machine
learning algorithms with large datasets on currently available quantum
computers.

oscillatory phase. This paper establishes new upper bounds for theta sums in
the case of smooth and box truncations. This generalises a classic 1977 result
of Fiedler, Jurkat and K\""orner for one-variable theta sums and, in the
multi-variable case, improves previous estimates obtained by Cosentino and
Flaminio in 2015. Key steps in our approach are the automorphic representation
of theta functions and their growth in the cusps of the underlying homogeneous
space.

  tables. Submitted to Biometrics",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the management of most chronic conditions characterized by the lack of
universally effective treatments, adaptive treatment strategies (ATSs) have
been growing in popularity as they offer a more individualized approach, and
sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMARTs) have gained attention
as the most suitable clinical trial design to formalize the study of these
strategies. While the number of SMARTs has increased in recent years, their
design has remained limited to the frequentist setting, which may not fully or
appropriately account for uncertainty in design parameters and hence not yield
appropriate sample size recommendations. Specifically, standard frequentist
formulae rely on several assumptions that can be easily misspecified. The
Bayesian framework offers a straightforward path to alleviate some of these
concerns. In this paper, we provide calculations in a Bayesian setting to allow
more realistic and robust estimates that account for uncertainty in inputs
through the `two priors' approach. Additionally, compared to the standard
formulae, this methodology allows us to rely on fewer assumptions, integrate
pre-trial knowledge, and switch the focus from the standardized effect size to
the minimal detectable difference. The proposed methodology is evaluated in a
thorough simulation study and is implemented to estimate the sample size for a
full-scale SMART of an Internet-Based Adaptive Stress Management intervention
based on a pilot SMART conducted on cardiovascular disease patients from two
Canadian provinces.

  a Large Crowd- and Expert-Annotated Twitter Dataset","ACL 2021",,,,"cs.CL cs.SI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We introduce the well-established social scientific concept of social
solidarity and its contestation, anti-solidarity, as a new problem setting to
supervised machine learning in NLP to assess how European solidarity discourses
changed before and after the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a global pandemic.
To this end, we annotate 2.3k English and German tweets for (anti-)solidarity
expressions, utilizing multiple human annotators and two annotation approaches
(experts vs.\ crowds). We use these annotations to train a BERT model with
multiple data augmentation strategies. Our augmented BERT model that combines
both expert and crowd annotations outperforms the baseline BERT classifier
trained with expert annotations only by over 25 points, from 58\% macro-F1 to
almost 85\%. We use this high-quality model to automatically label over 270k
tweets between September 2019 and December 2020. We then assess the
automatically labeled data for how statements related to European
(anti-)solidarity discourses developed over time and in relation to one
another, before and during the COVID-19 crisis. Our results show that
solidarity became increasingly salient and contested during the crisis. While
the number of solidarity tweets remained on a higher level and dominated the
discourse in the scrutinized time frame, anti-solidarity tweets initially
spiked, then decreased to (almost) pre-COVID-19 values before rising to a
stable higher level until the end of 2020.

built on our proposed pipeline. This pipeline begins with speech-based signal
processing, after which some simple musical heuristics are applied, and finally
these pre-processed signals are passed through Transformer models trained on
new musical tasks. We illustrate the effectiveness of our pipeline -- which
does not require a paired dataset for training -- through examples of music

tools for sensemaking of data in various domains (e.g., bioinformatics,
cybersecurity and text analytics). One common task of visual analysis with
multiple views is to relate data across different views. For example, to
identify threats, an intelligence analyst needs to link people from a social
network graph with locations on a crime-map, and then search for and read
relevant documents. Currently, exploring cross-view data relationships heavily
relies on view-coordination techniques (e.g., brushing and linking), which may
require significant user effort on many trial-and-error attempts, such as
repetitiously selecting elements in one view, and then observing and following
elements highlighted in other views. To address this, we present SightBi, a
visual analytics approach for supporting cross-view data relationship
explorations. We discuss the design rationale of SightBi in detail, with
identified user tasks regarding the use of cross-view data relationships.
SightBi formalizes cross-view data relationships as biclusters, computes them
from a dataset, and uses a bi-context design that highlights creating
stand-alone relationship-views. This helps preserve existing views and offers
an overview of cross-view data relationships to guide user exploration.
Moreover, SightBi allows users to interactively manage the layout of multiple
views by using newly created relationship-views. With a usage scenario, we
demonstrate the usefulness of SightBi for sensemaking of cross-view data
relationships.

1 April 2019 15:00 UTC and 1 October 2019 15:00 UTC. We present GWTC-2.1, which
reports on a deeper list of candidate events observed over the same period. We
analyze the final version of the strain data over this period with improved
calibration and better subtraction of excess noise, which has been publicly
released. We employ three matched-filter search pipelines for candidate
identification, and estimate the astrophysical probability for each candidate
event. While GWTC-2 used a false alarm rate threshold of 2 per year, we include
in GWTC-2.1, 1201 candidates that pass a false alarm rate threshold of 2 per
day. We calculate the source properties of a subset of 44 high-significance
candidates that have an astrophysical probability greater than 0.5. Of these
candidates, 36 have been reported in GWTC-2. If the 8 additional
high-significance candidates presented here are astrophysical, the mass range
of events that are unambiguously identified as binary black holes (both objects
$\geq 3M_\odot$) is increased compared to GWTC-2, with total masses from $\sim
14 M_\odot$ for GW190924_021846 to $\sim 182 M_\odot$ for GW190426_190642. The
primary components of two new candidate events (GW190403_051519 and
GW190426_190642) fall in the mass gap predicted by pair instability supernova
theory. We also expand the population of binaries with significantly asymmetric
mass ratios reported in GWTC-2 by an additional two events (the mass ratio is
less than $0.65$ and $0.44$ at $90\%$ probability for GW190403_051519 and
GW190917_114630 respectively), and find that 2 of the 8 new events have
effective inspiral spins $\chi_\mathrm{eff} > 0$ (at $90\%$ credibility), while
no binary is consistent with $\chi_\mathrm{eff} < 0$ at the same significance.

two-dimensional (2D) time-periodic flow and in a simple simulation. Results
show that the presence of bacteria hinders large scale transport and reduce
overall mixing rate. Stretching fields, calculated from experimentally measured
velocity fields, show that bacterial activity attenuates fluid stretching and
lowers flow chaoticity. Simulations suggest that this attenuation may be
attributed to a transient accumulation of bacteria along regions of high
stretching. Spatial power spectra and correlation functions of dye
concentration fields show that the transport of scalar variance across scales
is also hindered by bacterial activity, resulting in an increase in average
size and lifetime of structures. On the other hand, at small scales, activity
seems to enhance local mixing. One piece of evidence is that the probability
distribution of the spatial concentration gradients is nearly symmetric with a
vanishing skewness. Overall, our results show that the coupling between
activity and flow can lead to nontrivial effects on mixing and transport.

(BBH) systems can provide insight into their dynamics and formation. To date,
all of the LIGO-Virgo BBH detections have been made using quasi-circular
templates in their initial discovery. However, recent studies have found some
of these systems to be compatible with high eccentricity in the LIGO band,
$e_{10 \textrm{Hz}} > 0.1$, possibly pointing to a population of sources that
are challenging to detect. Current low-latency search methods used with
ground-based GW detector data are not well equipped to detect highly eccentric
sources. Template-based, matched-filter searches require accurate eccentric
waveform models that are computational expensive. Unmodeled burst searches are
designed to detected localized excess power and are unable to identify multiple
isolated bursts, as would originate from a single highly eccentric BBH.
Therefore, we propose a signal-based prior that can be incorporated into an
existing GW burst search to target highly eccentric BBHs. Our eccentric burst
prior is based on the Newtonian burst model described by Loutrel & Yunes
(2017). As a proof of concept, we test our method on simulated data and find
that for intermediate SNR $\sim3-6$ signals using the eccentric burst prior
more effectively localizes GW bursts when compared to a uniform prior.

reconciled if the toroidal magnetic fields are subject to oscillations
following the proto-neutron star (PNS) dynamo stage. Depending on the phase of
the oscillation at which the oscillations are terminated, the neutron star can
have a very high ($\gtrsim 10^{15}\,{\rm G}$) or relatively small ($\sim

dynamo model for the generation of PNS magnetic fields and show that the
toroidal field indeed exhibits oscillations following the dynamo stage. We
argue that these Alfv\'enic oscillations can lead to the formation of both
magnetars and ordinary neutron stars depending on at what phase of the

computing. TI systems with multiple interconnected traps can overcome the
hardware connectivity issue inherent in superconducting qubits and can solve
practical problems at scale. With a sufficient number of qubits on the horizon,
the multi-programming model for Quantum Computers (QC) has been proposed where
multiple users share the same QC for their computing. Multi-programming is
enticing for quantum cloud providers as it can maximize device utilization,
throughput, and profit for clouds. Users can also benefit from the short wait
queue. However, shared access to quantum computers can create new security
issues. This paper presents one such vulnerability in shared TI systems that
require shuttle operations for communication among traps. Repeated shuttle
operations increase quantum bit energy and degrade the reliability of
computations (fidelity). We show adversarial program design approaches
requiring numerous shuttles. We propose a random and systematic methodology for
adversary program generation. Our analysis shows shuttle-exploiting attacks can
substantially degrade the fidelities of victim programs by 2X to 63X. Finally,
we present several countermeasures such as adopting a hybrid initial mapping

given an image, the goal is to automatically generate a sentence describing the
context of the image with each noun word grounded to the corresponding region

region word alignments as supervision. Previous weakly supervised methods
mainly explore various kinds of regularization schemes to improve attention
accuracy. However, their performances are still far from the fully supervised
ones. One main issue that has been ignored is that the attention for generating
visually groundable words may only focus on the most discriminate parts and can
not cover the whole object. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective
method to alleviate the issue, termed as partial grounding problem in our
paper. Specifically, we design a distributed attention mechanism to enforce the
network to aggregate information from multiple spatially different regions with
consistent semantics while generating the words. Therefore, the union of the
focused region proposals should form a visual region that encloses the object
of interest completely. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority
of our proposed method compared with the state-of-the-arts.

design a mixed input convolutional neural network approach to predict transport
properties in deformed nanoscale materials using a height map of deformations
(from scanning probe information) as input. We employ our approach to study
electrical transport in a graphene nanoribbon deformed by a number of randomly
positioned nano-bubbles. Our network is able to make conductance predictions
valid to an average error of 4.3\%. We demonstrate that such low average errors
are achieved by including additional inputs like energy in a highly redundant
fashion, which allows predictions that are 30-40\% more accurate than
conventional architectures. We demonstrate that the same method can learn to
predict the valley-resolved conductance, with success specifically in
identifying the energy at which inter-valley scattering becomes prominent. We
demonstrate the robustness of the approach by testing the pre-trained network
on samples with deformations differing in number and shape from the training
data. We employ a graph theoretical analysis of the structure and outputs of
the network and conclude that a tight-binding Hamiltonian is effectively
encoded in the first layer of the network. We confirm our graph theoretical
analysis numerically for different hopping processes in a trained network and
find the result to be accurate within an error of 1\%. Our approach contributes
a new theoretical understanding and a refined methodology to the application of
deep learning for the determination transport properties based on real-space
disorder information.

one for degradation prediction and the other for conditional restoration.
However, our experiments show that a one-branch network can achieve comparable
performance to the two-branch scheme. Then we wonder: how can one-branch
networks automatically learn to distinguish degradations? To find the answer,
we propose a new diagnostic tool -- Filter Attribution method based on Integral
Gradient (FAIG). Unlike previous integral gradient methods, our FAIG aims at
finding the most discriminative filters instead of input pixels/features for
degradation removal in blind SR networks. With the discovered filters, we
further develop a simple yet effective method to predict the degradation of an
input image. Based on FAIG, we show that, in one-branch blind SR networks, 1)
we are able to find a very small number of (1%) discriminative filters for each
specific degradation; 2) The weights, locations and connections of the
discovered filters are all important to determine the specific network
function. 3) The task of degradation prediction can be implicitly realized by
these discriminative filters without explicit supervised learning. Our findings
can not only help us better understand network behaviors inside one-branch
blind SR networks, but also provide guidance on designing more efficient
architectures and diagnosing networks for blind SR.

including differences in C and O abundance ratios, observational bias, and
differences in ISM properties. In order to elucidate the underlying physics
that drives this high-redshift phenomenon, we employ SPHINX$^{20}$, a
state-of-the-art, cosmological radiation-hydrodynamics simulation, that
resolves detailed ISM properties of thousands of galaxies in the epoch of
reionization. We find that the observed $z>6$ [OIII]-SFR and [CII]-SFR

lower than Solar and the total metal production is $\sim4\times$ higher than
that of a Kroupa IMF. This implies that high-redshift galaxies are potentially
primarily enriched by low-metallicity core-collapse supernovae with a more
top-heavy IMF. As AGB stars and type-Ia supernova begin to contribute to the
galaxy metallicity, both the [CII]-SFR and [CII] luminosity functions are
predicted to converge to observed values at $z\sim4.5$. While we demonstrate
that ionisation parameter, LyC escape fraction, ISM gas density, and CMB
attenuation all drive galaxies towards higher [OIII]/[CII], observed values at
$z>6$ can only be reproduced with substantially lower C/O abundances compared
to Solar. The combination of [CII] and [OIII] can be used to predict the values
of ionisation parameter, ISM gas density, and LyC escape fraction and we
provide estimates of these quantities for nine observed $z>6$ galaxies.
Finally, we demonstrate that [OI]$_{\rm 63\mu m}$ can be used as a replacement

planet under the combined effects of tidal dissipation and gravitational
perturbation from an external companion. Such a ""spin + companion"" system
(called Colombo's top) appears in many [exo]planetary contexts. The competition
between the tidal torque (which drives spin-orbit alignment and
synchronization) and the gravitational torque from the companion (which drives
orbital precession of the planet) gives rise to two possible spin equilibria
(""Tidal Cassini Equilibria"", tCE) that are stable and attracting: the ""simple""
tCE1, which typically has a low spin obliquity, and the ""resonant"" tCE2, which
can have a significant obliquity. The latter arises from a spin-orbit resonance
and can be broken when the tidal alignment torque is stronger than the
precessional torque from the companion. We characterize the long-term evolution
of the planetary spin (both magnitude and obliquity) for an arbitrary initial
spin orientation, and develop a new theoretical method to analytically obtain
the probability of resonance capture driven by tidal dissipation. Applying our
general theoretical results to exoplanetary systems, we find that a super-Earth
(SE) with an exterior companion can have a substantial probability of being
trapped in the high-obliquity tCE2, assuming that SEs have a wide range of
primordial obliquities. We also evaluate the recently proposed ""obliquity tide""
scenarios for the formation of ultra-short-period Earth-mass planets and for
the orbital decay of hot Jupiter WASP-12b. We find in both cases that the

dense environments. Heggie's law states that, due to their environments, hard
binaries (whose orbital energy surpasses the typical energy of single stars)
tend to harden (increase their orbital energy), while soft binaries typically
soften. Here, we show that Heggie's law sometimes needs to be revised, by
accounting for an external potential, for example, for binaries in nuclear
stellar discs or AGN discs, that are affected by the central massive black
hole, or binary planetesimals in proto-planetary discs, affected by the host
star. We find that in such environments, where the Hill radius is finite,
binary-single scattering can have different outcomes. In particular, a
three-body encounter could be cut short due to stars being ejected beyond the
Hill radius, thereby ceasing to participate in further close interactions. This
leads to a systematic difference in the energy changes brought about by the
encounter, and in particular slows binary hardening, and even causes some hard
binaries to soften, on average, rather than harden. We use our previously
derived analytical, statistical solution to the bound chaotic three-body
problem to quantitatively characterise the revision of the hardening-softening
phase transition and evolution of binaries. We also provide an analytical
calculation of the mean hardening rate of binaries in any environment (also
reproducing the results of detailed N-body simulations). We show that the

and magnetic activity in solar-type stars appears to be strongly coupled.
Recent observations suggest that rotation rates evolve much more slowly beyond
middle-age, while stellar activity continues to decline. We aim to characterize
this mid-life transition by combining archival stellar activity data from the
Mount Wilson Observatory with asteroseismology from the Transiting Exoplanet
Survey Satellite (TESS). For two stars on opposite sides of the transition (88
Leo and $\rho$ CrB), we independently assess the mean activity levels and
rotation periods previously reported in the literature. For the less active
star ($\rho$ CrB), we detect solar-like oscillations from TESS photometry, and
we obtain precise stellar properties from asteroseismic modeling. We derive
updated X-ray luminosities for both stars to estimate their mass-loss rates,
and we use previously published constraints on magnetic morphology to model the
evolutionary change in magnetic braking torque. We then attempt to match the
observations with rotational evolution models, assuming either standard
spin-down or weakened magnetic braking. We conclude that the asteroseismic age
of $\rho$ CrB is consistent with the expected evolution of its mean activity
level, and that weakened braking models can more readily explain its relatively
fast rotation rate. Future spectropolarimetric observations across a range of
spectral types promise to further characterize the shift in magnetic morphology
that apparently drives this mid-life transition in solar-type stars.

fractions show the bright end excess beyond the Schechter function at >2sigma
levels, which is possibly made by inefficient mass quenching, low dust
obscuration, and/or hidden AGN activity. By analyzing the correlation functions
at z~2-6 with halo occupation distribution models, we find a weak redshift
evolution (within 0.3 dex) of the ratio of the star formation rate (SFR) to the
dark matter accretion rate, SFR/(dMh/dt), indicating the almost constant star
formation efficiency at z~2-6, as suggested by our earlier work at z~4-7.
Meanwhile, the ratio gradually increases with decreasing redshift at z<5 within
0.3 dex, which quantitatively reproduces the redshift evolution of the cosmic
SFR density, suggesting that the evolution is primarily driven by the increase
of the halo number density due to the structure formation, and the decrease of
the accretion rate due to the cosmic expansion. Extrapolating this calculation
to higher redshifts assuming the constant efficiency suggests a rapid decrease
of the SFR density at z>10 with $\propto10^{-0.5(1+z)}$, which will be directly
tested with JWST.

(GNNs) for semi-supervised learning tasks. Unfortunately this work has assumed
that the nodes labeled for use in training were selected uniformly at random
(i.e. are an IID sample). However in many real world scenarios gathering labels
for graph nodes is both expensive and inherently biased -- so this assumption
can not be met. GNNs can suffer poor generalization when this occurs, by
overfitting to superfluous regularities present in the training data. In this
work we present a method, Shift-Robust GNN (SR-GNN), designed to account for
distributional differences between biased training data and the graph's true
inference distribution. SR-GNN adapts GNN models for the presence of
distributional shifts between the nodes which have had labels provided for
training and the rest of the dataset. We illustrate the effectiveness of SR-GNN
in a variety of experiments with biased training datasets on common GNN
benchmark datasets for semi-supervised learning, where we see that SR-GNN
outperforms other GNN baselines by accuracy, eliminating at least (~40%) of the
negative effects introduced by biased training data. On the largest dataset we
consider, ogb-arxiv, we observe an 2% absolute improvement over the baseline

stars (HVSs) ejected from the centres of the Milky Way (MW) and the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC). In our model, HVSs are ejected at a constant rate --
equal in both galaxies -- via the Hills mechanism and are propagated in a
combined potential, where the LMC orbits the MW on its first infall. By
selecting $m>2\, \mathrm{M_\odot}$ HVSs well-separated from the Magellanic
Clouds and Galactic midplane, we identify mock HVSs which would stand out from
ordinary stars in the stellar halo in future data releases from the Gaia
satellite and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time
(LSST). We find that in these deep surveys, LMC HVSs will outnumber MW ones by
a factor $\sim 2.5$, as HVSs can more easily escape from the shallower
potential of the LMC. At an assumed HVS ejection rate of $10^{-4} \,
\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$, HVSs detectable in the final Gaia data release and LSST from
the LMC (MW) will number $125_{-12}^{+11}$ ($50_{-8}^{+7}$) and
$140_{-11}^{+10}$ ($42_{-7}^{+6}$), respectively. The MW and LMC HVS
populations show different kinematics and spatial distributions. While LMC HVSs
have more modest total velocities and larger Galactocentric distances clustered
around those of the LMC itself, HVSs from the MW show broader distributions,
including a prominent high-velocity tail above $500 \, \mathrm{km \ s^{-1}}$
that contains at least half of the stars. These predictions are robust against
reasonable variation of the Galactic potential and of the LMC central black
hole mass.

a suite of galaxy collision simulations using the adaptive mesh refinement code
ENZO with 1.25 pc resolution, which demonstrates that high-velocity galaxy

simultaneously. With a numerical resolution significantly better than our
previous study (Shin et al. 2020), we resolve the dynamical structure of the
produced DMDGs and the detailed formation history of their SCs which are
possible progenitors of the DMDG's member GCs. In particular, we show that a
galaxy collision with a high relative velocity of $\sim 300\;{\rm km\;s}^{-1}$,
invoking severe shock compression, spawns multiple massive SCs ($\gtrsim
10^{6}\;{\rm M}_{\odot}$) within 150 Myr after the collision. At the end of our

gravitational bound SCs with a line-of-sight velocity dispersion $11.2\;{\rm

form simultaneously in high-velocity galaxy collisions while being in line with
the key observed properties of NGC1052-DF2 and NGC1052-DF4.

system is intersecting, and for $r\leq9$ if the intersecting set system is
linear. In this note, we deal with Ryser's Conjecture for intersecting
$r$-partite linear systems; that is, if $\tau$ is the transversal number for an
intersecting $r$-partite linear system, then Ryser's Conjecture states that
$\tau\leq r-1$. If this conjecture is true, this is known to be sharp for $r$
for which there exists a projective plane of order $r-1$. There has also been
considerable effort to find intersecting $r$-partite set systems whose
transversal number is $r-1$.
  In this note, the following is proved: if $r\geq4$ is an even integer, then
$f_l(r)\geq3(r-2)+1$, where $f_l(r)$ is the minimum number of lines of an
intersecting $r$-partite linear system whose transversal number is $r-1$. This
lower bound gives an exact value for $f_l(r)$, for some small values of $r$.

that both the number of measurements and the structure of the witness play an

that SLGs have sub-mm colours colder than nearby dusty galaxies (the large

is believed to be a primary etiologic factor in common voice disorders such as
non-phonotraumatic vocal hyperfunction. Abnormal activity of antagonistic
laryngeal muscles is hypothesized to play a key role in the alteration of
normal vocal fold biomechanics that results in the dysphonia associated with
such disorders. Current low-order models of the vocal folds are unsatisfactory
to test this hypothesis since they do not capture the co-contraction of
antagonist laryngeal muscle pairs. To address this limitation, a self-sustained
triangular body-cover model with full intrinsic muscle control is introduced.
The proposed scheme shows good agreement with prior studies using finite
element models, excised larynges, and clinical studies in sustained and
time-varying vocal gestures. Simulations of vocal fold posturing obtained with
distinct antagonistic muscle activation yield clear differences in kinematic,
aerodynamic and acoustic measures. The proposed tool is deemed sufficiently
accurate and flexible for future comprehensive investigations of
non-phonotraumatic vocal hyperfunction and other laryngeal motor control
disorders.

investigated. For the isothermal work-to-work converter and/or small difference
of temperature between reservoirs, they are solely expressed in terms of
Onsager coefficients. Although the symmetric engine can operate very
inefficiently depending on the control parameters, the usage of distinct
contact times between the system and each reservoir not only can enhance the
machine performance (signed by an optimal tuning ensuring the largest gain) but
also enlarges substantially the machine regime operation. The present approach
can pave the way for the construction of efficient Brownian engines operating

machine learning model, which includes classical and quantum machine learning
(ML) models, is developed to identify incidents using the connected vehicle
(CV) data. The incident detection performance of the hybrid model is evaluated
against baseline classical ML models. The framework is evaluated using data
from a microsimulation tool for different incident scenarios. The results
indicate that a hybrid neural network containing a 4-qubit quantum layer
outperforms all other baseline models when there is a lack of training data. We
have created three datasets; DS-1 with sufficient training data, and DS-2 and
DS-3 with insufficient training data. The hybrid model achieves a recall of
98.9%, 98.3%, and 96.6% for DS-1, DS-2, and DS-3, respectively. For DS-2 and
DS-3, the average improvement in F2-score (measures model's performance to
correctly identify incidents) achieved by the hybrid model is 1.9% and 7.8%,
respectively, compared to the classical models. It shows that with insufficient
data, which may be common for CVs, the hybrid ML model will perform better than
the classical models. With the continuing improvements of quantum computing

CV-related applications when the available data is insufficient.

Much of this literature suggests that there is no escape from Arrow-style

comparing candidates in elections, which we call the Advantage-Standard (AS)

the AS model is in the spirit of but weaker than IIA; yet it is stronger than
what is known in the literature as weak IIA (two profiles alike on $x, y$
cannot have opposite strict social preferences on $x$ and $y$). In addition to
motivating violations of IIA, the AS model makes intelligible violations of
another Arrovian assumption: the negative transitivity of the strict social
preference relation $P$. While previous literature shows that only weakening
IIA to weak IIA or only weakening negative transitivity of $P$ to acyclicity
still leads to impossibility theorems, we show that jointly weakening IIA to AS
rationalizability and weakening negative transitivity of $P$ leads to no such

on the excitations of a self-interacting vector field known as the bumblebee

the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the bumblebee field $b_M$ violates the
local particle Lorentz symmetry. By assuming the bumblebee field living in a
$AdS_{5}$ bulk, we found an exponential suppression of the self-interacting
constant $\lambda$ and the bumblebee VEV along the extra dimension. The
fluctuations of the bumblebee upon the VEV can be decomposed into transverse
and longitudinal modes with respect to $b_{M}$. Despite the curvature, the
transverse mode acquires massive Kaluza-Klein towers, while the longitudinal
mode acquires LV mass $\lambda b^{2}$. On the other hand, the current
conservation law prevents massive Kaluza-Klein modes for the longitudinal mode.
For a spacelike $b_{M}$ along the extra dimension and assuming a FRW 3-brane
embedded in the $AdS_{5}$ yields to an additional dissipative term to the
longitudinal mode. The cosmological expansion leads to decay of the
longitudinal mode in a time $\Delta t \approx H^{-1}$, where $H=\dot{a}/a$ is

the longitudinal mode does not propagate on the brane and its amplitude decays

disrupted by the tidal gravitational field of the SMBH. The resulting debris
forms a tidal stream orbiting the SMBH which can collide with itself due to
relativistic apsidal precession. These self-collisions dissipate energy,
causing the stream to circularize. We perform kinematic simulations of these
stream self-collisions to estimate the efficiency of this circularization as a
function of SMBH mass $M_\bullet$ and penetration factor $\beta$, the ratio of
the tidal radius to the pericenter distance. We uncover two distinct regimes
depending on whether the time $t_c$ at which the most tightly bound debris
circularizes is greater or less than the time $t_{\rm fb}$ at which the mass
fallback rate peaks. The bolometric light curve of energy dissipated in the
stream self-collisions has a single peak at $t > t_{\rm fb}$ in the slow
circularization regime ($t_c > t_{\rm fb}$), but two peaks (one at $t < t_{\rm
fb}$ and a second at $t_{\rm fb}$) in the fast circularization regime ($t_c <
t_{\rm fb}$). Tidal streams will circularize in the slow (fast) regime for
apsidal precession angles less (greater) than 0.2 radians which occur for
$\beta \lesssim (\gtrsim) (M_\bullet/10^6M_\odot)^{-2/3}$. The observation of
prominent double peaks in bolometric TDE light curves near the transition

among native Arabic speakers and foreign learners alike. Some of these errors
are typographical in nature. They occur due to orthographic variations of some
Arabic letters and the complex rules that dictate their correct usage. Many
people forgo these rules, and given the identical phonetic sounds, they often
confuse such letters. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional long short-term
memory network that corrects this class of errors. We develop, train, evaluate,
and compare a set of BiLSTM networks. We approach the spelling correction
problem at the character level. We handle Arabic texts from both classical and
modern standard Arabic. We treat the problem as a one-to-one sequence
transcription problem. Since the soft Arabic errors class encompasses omission
and addition mistakes, to preserve the one-to-one sequence transcription, we
propose a simple low-resource yet effective technique that maintains the
one-to-one sequencing and avoids using a costly encoder-decoder architecture.
We train the BiLSTM models to correct the spelling mistakes using transformed
input and stochastic error injection approaches. We recommend a configuration
that has two BiLSTM layers, uses the dropout regularization, and is trained
using the latter training approach with error injection rate of 40%. The best
model corrects 96.4% of the injected errors and achieves a low character error
rate of 1.28% on a real test set of soft spelling mistakes.

the attenuation and amplification of LALOs using high-resolution numerical
simulations with progressively increasing spatial resolutions. We performed
time-dependent numerical simulations of LALOs using the 2D magnetic
configuration that contains a dipped region. After the prominence mass loading
in the magnetic dips, we triggered LALOs by perturbing the prominence mass
along the magnetic field. We performed the experiments with four values of
spatial resolution. In the simulations with the highest resolution, the period
shows a good agreement with the pendulum model. The convergence experiment
revealed that the damping time saturates at the bottom prominence region with
improving the resolution, indicating the existence of a physical reason for the
damping of oscillations. At the prominence top, the oscillations are amplified
during the first minutes and then are slowly attenuated. The characteristic
time suggests more significant amplification in the experiments with the
highest spatial resolution. The analysis revealed that the energy exchange
between the bottom and top prominence regions is responsible for the
attenuation and amplification of LALOs. The high-resolution experiments are
crucial for the study of the periods and the damping mechanism of LALOs. The
period agrees with the pendulum model only when using high enough spatial
resolution. The results suggest that numerical diffusion in simulations with
insufficient spatial resolution can hide important physical mechanisms, such as
amplification of oscillations.

comparison of multiple adaptive treatment strategies (ATSs) simultaneously.
Previous studies have established a framework to test the homogeneity of
multiple ATSs by a global Wald test through inverse probability weighting.
SMARTs are generally lengthier than classical clinical trials due to the
sequential nature of treatment randomization in multiple stages. Thus, it would
be beneficial to add interim analyses allowing for early stop if overwhelming
efficacy is observed. We introduce group sequential methods to SMARTs to
facilitate interim monitoring based on multivariate chi-square distribution.
Simulation study demonstrates that the proposed interim monitoring in SMART
(IM-SMART) maintains the desired type I error and power with reduced expected
sample size compared to the classical SMART. Lastly, we illustrate our method
by re-analyzing a SMART assessing the effects of cognitive behavioral and

conjecture, as follows.
  1. For $t\geq 2$, a $t$-theta is a graph consisting of two nonadjacent
vertices and three internally disjoint paths between them, each of length at
least $t$. A $t$-pyramid is a graph consisting of a vertex $v$, a triangle $B$

whether every graph of bounded maximum degree and sufficiently large treewidth
contains either a theta or a triangle as an induced subgraph (where a theta
means a $t$-theta for some $t\geq 2$).
  2. A subcubic subdivided caterpillar is a tree of maximum degree at most

Programmers either have to manually search for the correct FQN of identifiers

on resolving the FQN for an identifier in a code snippet, they leave the
challenge of finding the correct third-party library (i.e., dependency)

form by assuming that they have a permanent magnetic dipole moment, pointing
along their self-propulsion (swim) direction. Using a continuum approach, we
show that a host of behaviors emerge over the parameter space spanned by the
particle aspect ratio, self-propulsion and shear/field strengths, and the
channel width. The cross-stream migration of the model swimmers is shown to
involve a regime of linear response (quantified by a linear-response factor) in
weak fields. For prolate swimmers, the weak-field behavior crosses over to a
regime of full swimmer migration to the bottom half of the channel in strong
fields. For oblate swimmers, a counterintuitive regime of reverse migration
arises in intermediate fields, where a macroscopic fraction of swimmers
reorient and swim to the top channel half at an acute `upward' angle relative
to the field axis. The diverse behaviors reported here are analyzed based on
the shear-induced population splitting (bimodality) of the swim orientation,
giving two distinct, oppositely polarized, swimmer subpopulations (albeit very
differently for prolate/oblate swimmers) in each channel half. In strong
fields, swimmers of both types exhibit net upstream currents relative to the
laboratory frame. The onsets of full migration and net upstream current depend
on the aspect ratio, enabling efficient particle separation strategies in

when provided as observations in place of raw sensor data (e.g., RGB images).
However, such policies must still learn latent three-dimensional scene
properties from mid-level abstractions. In contrast, high-level, hierarchical
representations such as 3D scene graphs explicitly provide a scene's geometry,
topology, and semantics, making them compelling representations for navigation.
In this work, we present a reinforcement learning framework that leverages
high-level hierarchical representations to learn navigation policies. Towards
this goal, we propose a graph neural network architecture and show how to embed
a 3D scene graph into an agent-centric feature space, which enables the robot
to learn policies for low-level action in an end-to-end manner. For each node
in the scene graph, our method uses features that capture occupancy and
semantic content, while explicitly retaining memory of the robot trajectory. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method against commonly used visuomotor

ablation studies show that our method leads to more effective object search

correlation, allowing memory-based learning algorithms to effectively learn
waveform selection strategies. This work examines a radar system which builds a

quantum-mechanical systems in physics and chemistry. Current quantum computers
execute their algorithms imperfectly, due to uncorrected noise, gate errors,
and decoherence. This severely limits the size and scope of protocols which can
be run on near-term quantum hardware. Much research has been focused on
building more robust hardware to address this issue, however the advantages of
more robust algorithms remains largely unexplored. Here we show that algorithms
for solving the driven-dissipative many-body problem, among the hardest
problems in quantum mechanics, are inherently robust against errors. We find it
is possible to solve dissipative problems requiring deep circuits on current
quantum devices due to the contractive nature of their time evolution maps. We
simulate one thousand steps of time evolution for the non-interacting limit of
the infinite driven-dissipative Hubbard model, calculate the current through
the system and prepare a thermal state of the atomic limit of the Hubbard
model. These problems were solved using circuits containing up to two thousand
entangling gates on quantum computers made available by IBM, showing no signs
of decreasing fidelity at long times. Our results demonstrate that algorithms
for simulating dissipative problems are able to far out-perform similarly
complex non-dissipative algorithms on noisy hardware. Our two algorithmic
primitives are the basic building blocks of many condensed-matter-physics
systems, and we anticipate their demonstrated robustness to hold when
generalized to solve the full many-body driven-dissipative quantum problem.
Building upon the algorithms presented here may prove to be the most promising
approach to tackle important, classically intractable problems on quantum
computers before error correction is available.

waves in the framework of Euler equations of the free surface. The purpose is
to understand the variation of the scaling of the spectra with wavenumber $k$
and energy flux $P$ at different nonlinearity levels under different
forcing/free-decay conditions. For all conditions (free decay, narrow- and
broadband forcing) we consider, we find that the spectral forms approach wave
turbulence theory (WTT) solution $S_\eta\sim k^{-5/2}$ and $S_\eta\sim P^{1/3}$
at high nonlinearity levels. With the decrease of nonlinearity level, the
spectra for all cases become steeper, with the narrow-band forcing case
exhibiting the most rapid deviation from WTT. To interpret these spectral
variations, we further investigate two hypothetical and disputable mechanisms
about bound waves and finite-size effect. Through a tri-coherence analysis, we
find that the finite-size effect is present in all cases, which is responsible
for the overall steepening of the spectra and reduced capacity of energy flux
at lower nonlinearity levels. The fraction of bound waves in the domain
generally decreases with the decrease of nonlinearity level, except for the
narrow-band case, which exhibits a transition at some critical nonlinearity
level below which a rapid increase is observed. This increase serves as the
main reason for the fastest deviation from WTT with the decrease of
nonlinearity in the narrow-band forcing case.

temperature where the microgel particles shrink dramatically and develop a more
deeply attractive interparticle potential, the droplets of the colloid-rich

these droplets of gelled colloidal particles reliquefy and phase separation

Italian population during the Covid-19 pandemic, focusing on the period that

Bayesian dynamic latent-class regression model, that accounts for the effect of
sampling bias including survey weights into the likelihood function. According
to the proposed approach, attitudes towards Covid-19 are described via three
ideal behaviors that are fixed over time, corresponding to different degrees of
compliance with spread-preventive measures. The overall tendency toward a
specific profile dynamically changes across survey waves via a latent Gaussian
process regression, that adjusts for subject-specific covariates. We illustrate
the dynamic evolution of Italians' behaviors during the pandemic, providing
insights on how the proportion of ideal behaviors has varied during the phases
of the lockdown, while measuring the effect of age, sex, region and employment

Extensive experiments using deep-segmentation networks and unsupervised methods
have been performed on multimodal datasets representing four distinct vineyards

SegNet, U-Net, and ModSegNet have equivalent overall performance in vine

sufficient on most of the datasets. Furthermore, results suggest that
high-definition RGB images produce equivalent or higher performance than any

and gravity via weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering. It will carry
out a wide area imaging and spectroscopy survey (EWS) in visible and
near-infrared, covering roughly 15,000 square degrees of extragalactic sky on
six years. The wide-field telescope and instruments are optimized for pristine
PSF and reduced straylight, producing very crisp images. This paper presents
the building of the Euclid reference survey: the sequence of pointings of EWS,
Deep fields, Auxiliary fields for calibrations, and spacecraft movements
followed by Euclid as it operates in a step-and-stare mode from its orbit
around the Lagrange point L2. Each EWS pointing has four dithered frames; we
simulate the dither pattern at pixel level to analyse the effective coverage.
We use up-to-date models for the sky background to define the Euclid
region-of-interest (RoI). The building of the reference survey is highly
constrained from calibration cadences, spacecraft constraints and background
levels; synergies with ground-based coverage are also considered. Via
purposely-built software optimized to prioritize best sky areas, produce a
compact coverage, and ensure thermal stability, we generate a schedule for the
Auxiliary and Deep fields observations and schedule the RoI with EWS transit
observations. The resulting reference survey RSD_2021A fulfills all constraints
and is a good proxy for the final solution. Its wide survey covers 14,500
square degrees. The limiting AB magnitudes ($5\sigma$ point-like source)
achieved in its footprint are estimated to be 26.2 (visible) and 24.5
(near-infrared); for spectroscopy, the H$_\alpha$ line flux limit is $2\times
10^{-16}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ at 1600 nm; and for diffuse emission the
surface brightness limits are 29.8 (visible) and 28.4 (near-infrared) mag
arcsec$^{-2}$.

Memory (DWM), related to Spin-Transfer Torque Memory (STT-MRAM), provides
near-SRAM read/write performance, energy savings and nonvolatility, potential
for extremely high storage density, and does not have significant endurance
limitations. However, DWM's benefits cannot address data access latency and
throughput limitations of memory bus bandwidth. We propose PIRM, a DWM-based
in-memory computing solution that leverages the properties of DWM nanowires and
allows them to serve as polymorphic gates. While normally DWM is accessed by
applying spin polarized currents orthogonal to the nanowire at access points to
read individual bits, transverse access along the DWM nanowire allows the
differentiation of the aggregate resistance of multiple bits in the nanowire,
akin to a multilevel cell. PIRM leverages this transverse reading to directly
provide bulk-bitwise logic of multiple adjacent operands in the nanowire,
simultaneously. Based on this in-memory logic, PIRM provides a technique to
conduct multi-operand addition and two operand multiplication using transverse
access. PIRM provides a 1.6x speedup compared to the leading DRAM PIM technique
for query applications that leverage bulk bitwise operations. Compared to the
leading PIM technique for DWM, PIRM improves performance by 6.9x, 2.3x and
energy by 5.5x, 3.4x for 8-bit addition and multiplication, respectively. For
arithmetic heavy benchmarks, PIRM reduces access latency by 2.1x, while

metric on the cuts of $\mathscr{I}$ is not fixed to be Einstein, while the
other sticks to Einstein but time-dependent metrics. Both are novel features
with respect to the four-dimensional case, where time-dependence of the
two-dimensional cross-sectional metric is not required and the Einstein
condition is trivially satisfied. Other cases are also discussed. These
conditions imply that the configuration spaces are not asymptotically flat in
the standard sense. We discuss the implications on the construction of the
phase space and the relationship with soft scattering theorems. We show that in
even spacetime dimensions, the initial data compatible with such asymptotic
symmetries produce maximally polyhomogeneous expansions of the metric and we
advance a potential interpretation of this structure in terms of AdS/CFT and
realizations of Ricci-flat holography.

technologies that take advantage from quantum resources, such as entanglement
and quantum coherence. Bearing this in mind, in this work we study the dynamics
of quantum resources for two solid-state fermionic quantum devices: (i) a
system composed by a pair of Majorana fermions and (ii) another comprising a
pair of regular fermions. In both systems, the fermionic species are coupled to
a single-level quantum dot. From the interaction of these tripartite systems
with a dissipative reservoir, we were able to characterize the dynamics of the
devices for some initial states. By employing a time-nonlocal master equation
approach, we obtain the evolution for fermionic occupations, quantum
correlations, and quantum coherences in both the Markovian and non-Markovian
dissipating regimes. We investigate the interconversion of local coherence and
bipartite correlations for the marginal states in each device. While the
dynamics of the entanglement and quantum coherence depend quite strongly on the
temperature of the reservoir for regular fermions, we found these evolutions
are qualitatively similar for the case of Majorana bound states regardless of
temperature. Our results illustrate the use of quantum information-theoretic
measures to characterize the role of quantum resources in fermion systems.

less than $2.5\ {M_\odot}$ exhibit a unimodal distribution, with the peak
velocity ratio increasing as stellar mass increases. A bimodal rotation
distribution, composed of two branches of slowly and rapidly rotating stars,
emerges for more massive stars ($M>2.5\ {M_\odot}$). For stars more massive
than $3.0\ {M_\odot}$, the gap between the bifurcated branches becomes
prominent. For the first time, we find that metal-poor ([M/H] $< -0.2$ dex)
stars only exhibit a single branch of slow rotators, while metal-rich ([M/H] $>

to unexpectedly high spin-down rates and/or in part strong magnetic fields in

is to generate them, for example, with an automatic audio-tagging system. The
output probabilities of such systems (so-called ""soft labels"") carry rich
information about the characteristics of the respective audios and can be used
to distill the knowledge from a teacher model into a student model. In this
work, we perform knowledge distillation from a large audio tagging system into

measured in the canonical dipolar spin ice compound Ho$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$, while
the latter rises sharply at low temperatures, initially plateauing near 0.08 K,
before falling off towards a high temperature zero beyond 3 K. Above $\sim$0.5
K, the $C_p$ data set can be fit to the results of a quantum numerical linked
cluster (NLC) calculation, carried out to 4$^{\mathrm{th}}$ order, that allows
estimates for the terms in the near-neighbour XYZ Hamiltonian expected for such
DO pyrochlore systems. Fits of the same theory to the temperature dependence of
the magnetic susceptibility and unpolarized neutron scattering complement this
analysis. A comparison between the resulting best fit NLC calculation and the
polarized neutron diffraction shows both agreement and discrepancies, mostly in
the form of zone-boundary diffuse scattering in the non-spin flip channel,

observed thermodynamic anomaly and the constraints on the near-neighbour XYZ

derive a simple recipe that allows explicit derivative evaluation. The

circuits with shifted parameters. The number of function evaluations is equal
to the number of unique positive non-zero spectral gaps (eigenvalue
differences) for the generator. We apply the approach to relevant examples of
two-qubit gates, among others showing that the fSim gate can be differentiated
using four measurements. Additionally, we present generalized differentiation
rules for the case of Pauli string generators, based on distinct shifts (here
named as the triangulation approach), and analyse the variance for derivative

the crowd can provide reliable identification of fake news. However, fake news

adequate quality, including a custom search engine used by the crowd workers to
find web pages supporting their truthfulness assessments. A comprehensive
analysis of crowdsourced judgments shows that: (1) the crowdsourced assessments
are reliable when compared to an expert-provided gold standard; (2) the
proposed dimensions of truthfulness capture independent pieces of information;
(3) the crowdsourcing task can be easily learned by the workers; and (4) the
resulting assessments provide a useful basis for a more complete estimation of

scenarios, where the resource constraint and the superclass of interest
corresponding to a group of classes are dynamically specified. How to
efficiently deploy deep models for diverse deployment scenarios is a new
challenge. Previous NAS approaches seek to design architectures for all classes
simultaneously, which may not be optimal for some individual superclasses. A
straightforward solution is to search an architecture from scratch for each
deployment scenario, which however is computation-intensive and impractical. To
address this, we present a novel and general framework, called Elastic
Architecture Search (EAS), permitting instant specializations at runtime for
diverse superclasses with various resource constraints. To this end, we first
propose to effectively train an over-parameterized network via a superclass
dropout strategy during training. In this way, the resulting model is robust to
the subsequent superclasses dropping at inference time. Based on the
well-trained over-parameterized network, we then propose an efficient
architecture generator to obtain promising architectures within a single
forward pass. Experiments on three image classification datasets show that EAS
is able to find more compact networks with better performance while remarkably
being orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art NAS methods, e.g.,
outperforming OFA (once-for-all) by 1.3% on Top-1 accuracy at a budget around

offer a compact representation of landmark geometry useful for downstream
planning and manipulation tasks. However, measurement ambiguity then arises as
objects may possess complete or partial object shape symmetries (e.g., due to
occlusion), making it difficult or impossible to generate a single consistent
object pose estimate. One idea is to generate multiple pose candidates to
counteract measurement ambiguity. In this paper, we develop a novel approach
that enables an object-based SLAM system to reason about multiple pose
hypotheses for an object, and synthesize this locally ambiguous information
into a globally consistent robot and landmark pose estimation formulation. In
particular, we (1) present a learned pose estimation network that provides
multiple hypotheses about the 6D pose of an object; (2) by treating the output
of our network as components of a mixture model, we incorporate pose
predictions into a SLAM system, which, over successive observations, recovers a
globally consistent set of robot and object (landmark) pose estimates. We
evaluate our approach on the popular YCB-Video Dataset and a simulated video
featuring YCB objects. Experiments demonstrate that our approach is effective

distribution of future positions of mobile robots in order to detect and avoid
impending property violations such as collisions with obstacles or other
agents. Our approach uses a restricted class of temporal logic formulas to
represent the likely intentions of the agents along with a combination of
temporal logic-based optimal cost path planning and Bayesian inference to
compute the probability of these intents given the current trajectory of the
robot. First, we construct a large but finite hypothesis space of possible
intents represented as temporal logic formulas whose atomic propositions are
derived from a detailed map of the robot's workspace. Next, our approach uses
real-time observations of the robot's position to update a distribution over
temporal logic formulae that represent its likely intent. This is performed by
using a combination of optimal cost path planning and a Boltzmann noisy
rationality model. In this manner, we construct a Bayesian approach to
evaluating the posterior probability of various hypotheses given the observed
states and actions of the robot. Finally, we predict the future position of the
robot by drawing posterior predictive samples using a Monte-Carlo method. We
evaluate our framework using two different trajectory datasets that contain
multiple scenarios implementing various tasks. The results show that our method
can predict future positions precisely and efficiently, so that the computation
time for generating a prediction is a tiny fraction of the overall time
horizon.

from incomplete data. Finite sample properties of conditional observed
information matrices are established. They possess positive definiteness and
the same Loewner partial ordering as the expected information matrices do. An
explicit form of the observed Fisher information (OFI) is derived for the
calculation of standard errors of the ML estimates. It simplifies Louis (1982)
general formula for the OFI matrix. To prevent from getting an incorrect
inverse of the OFI matrix, which may be attributed by the lack of sparsity and
large size of the matrix, a monotone convergent recursive equation for the
inverse matrix is developed which in turn generalizes the algorithm of Hero and
Fessler (1994) for the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound. To improve the estimation, in
particular when applying repeated sampling to incomplete data, a robust
M-estimator is introduced. A closed form sandwich estimator of covariance
matrix is proposed to provide the standard errors of the M-estimator. By the
resulting loss of information presented in finite-sample incomplete data, the
sandwich estimator produces smaller standard errors for the M-estimator than
the ML estimates. In the case of complete information or absence of
re-sampling, the M-estimator coincides with the ML estimates. Application to
parameter estimation of a regime switching conditional Markov jump process is
discussed to verify the results. The simulation study confirms the accuracy and
asymptotic properties of the M-estimator.

the mixtures of speech signals to a popular attention-based neural ASR, known
as Listen, Attend, and Spell (LAS), at different target-to-interference ratio

details when two phonemes are mixed what will be the predicted phoneme; in this
fashion we build a model in which the most probable predictions for a phoneme

mixed speech signals at TIR = 0 dB and the performance approaches the unmixed
scenario at TIR = 30 dB. Our results show the model, when presented with mixed

challenges for existing simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)

objects. However, these object detectors are computationally too expensive for
mobile robot on-board processing. In practical applications, these objects
output noisy sounds that can be effectively detected by on-board sound source
localization. The directional information of the sound source object can be
efficiently obtained by direction of sound arrival (DoA) estimation, but depth
estimation is difficult. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel
audio-visual fusion approach that fuses sound source direction into the RGB-D

estimating the average treatment effect (ATE). However, empirical studies show
that the IPTW estimators can be sensitive to the misspecification of the
propensity score model. To address this problem, researchers have proposed to
estimate propensity score by directly optimizing the balance of pre-treatment
covariates. While these methods appear to empirically perform well, little is
known about how the choice of balancing conditions affects their theoretical
properties. To fill this gap, we first characterize the asymptotic bias and
efficiency of the IPTW estimator based on the Covariate Balancing Propensity
Score (CBPS) methodology under local model misspecification. Based on this
analysis, we show how to optimally choose the covariate balancing functions and
propose an optimal CBPS-based IPTW estimator. This estimator is doubly robust;
it is consistent for the ATE if either the propensity score model or the
outcome model is correct. In addition, the proposed estimator is locally
semiparametric efficient when both models are correctly specified. To further
relax the parametric assumptions, we extend our method by using a sieve
estimation approach. We show that the resulting estimator is globally efficient
under a set of much weaker assumptions and has a smaller asymptotic bias than
the existing estimators. Finally, we evaluate the finite sample performance of
the proposed estimators via simulation and empirical studies. An open-source
software package is available for implementing the proposed methods.

measures. It was first shown to hold for a free scalar field and causal
diamonds by Araki in 1964 and later by many authors in different ways. In
particular, Eckmann and Osterwalder (EO) used Tomita-Takesaki modular theory to
give a direct proof. However, it is not straightforward to relate this proof to
the works of Araki, since they rely on two forms of the canonical commutation
relations (CCR), called Segal and Weyl formulations, while EO work as starting
point assumes that duality holds in the so-called ``first quantization'' in the
Weyl formulation. It is our purpose to first introduce the works of Araki in a
more easy-to-read but still rigorous and self-contained fashion, and show how
Haag duality is stated in the Segal and Weyl formulations and in both first and
second quantizations (and their immediate combination). This permits to
understand the setting of the EO proof of Haag duality. There is nothing
essentially new in this manuscript, with the exception of what we consider a
simplification of EO proof that uses the adjoint $S^*$ of the Tomita operator
$S$ instead of introducing several auxiliary operators. We hope this note will

scenario with only continuous phase transitions between the paramagnetic state

kinematics of the mobile base, the arm, and the object to be manipulated in
mobile manipulations. Accordingly, a mobile manipulation task is represented by
altering the state of the constructed VKC, which can be converted to a motion
planning problem, formulated, and solved by trajectory optimization. This new
VKC perspective of mobile manipulation allows a service robot to (i) produce
well-coordinated motions, suitable for complex household environments, and (ii)
perform intricate multi-step tasks while interacting with multiple objects
without an explicit definition of intermediate goals. In simulated experiments,
we validate these advantages by comparing the VKC-based approach with baselines
that solely optimize individual components. The results manifest that VKC-based
joint modeling and planning promote task success rates and produce more
efficient trajectories.

  Methods for CTR Prediction","Published in ICDE 2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Click-through rate prediction is one of the core tasks in commercial
recommender systems. It aims to predict the probability of a user clicking a
particular item given user and item features. As feature interactions bring in
non-linearity, they are widely adopted to improve the performance of CTR
prediction models. Therefore, effectively modelling feature interactions has
attracted much attention in both the research and industry field. The current
approaches can generally be categorized into three classes: (1) na\""ive
methods, which do not model feature interactions and only use original
features; (2) memorized methods, which memorize feature interactions by
explicitly viewing them as new features and assigning trainable embeddings; (3)
factorized methods, which learn latent vectors for original features and
implicitly model feature interactions through factorization functions. Studies
have shown that modelling feature interactions by one of these methods alone
are suboptimal due to the unique characteristics of different feature
interactions. To address this issue, we first propose a general framework
called OptInter which finds the most suitable modelling method for each feature
interaction. Different state-of-the-art deep CTR models can be viewed as
instances of OptInter. To realize the functionality of OptInter, we also
introduce a learning algorithm that automatically searches for the optimal
modelling method. We conduct extensive experiments on four large datasets. Our
experiments show that OptInter improves the best performed state-of-the-art
baseline deep CTR models by up to 2.21%. Compared to the memorized method,
which also outperforms baselines, we reduce up to 91% parameters. In addition,
we conduct several ablation studies to investigate the influence of different
components of OptInter. Finally, we provide interpretable discussions on the
results of OptInter.

the switching current density ($J_{sw}$) is first examined in the ideal type-x
configuration. Next, we study the FM layer canting angle ($\phi_{EA}$)

existence of a sizable FLT, type-x switching mode results in a lower critical
switching current than type-y at current pulse width less than ~ 10 ns,
indicating the advantage of employing type-x design for ultrafast switching
using materials systems with FLT. Our work provides a thorough examination of

vehicle routing problem with a nonlinear charging function (E-VRP-NL)
introduced by Montoya et al. (2017). The E-VRP-NL captures several realistic
features of electric vehicles including the battery limited driving range and
nonlinear charging process at the charging stations. We formulate this problem
as a set-partitioning and solve it using a column generation based algorithm.
The resulting pricing problem of the column generation is a complicated problem
as, next to the usual operational constraints e.g. time windows and vehicle
capacity, electric vehicle related features are also considered. In particular,
the nonlinear nature of the battery charging process requires the incorporation
of a set of sophisticated recursive functions in the pricing algorithm. We show
how these recursive functions allow for the simultaneous evaluation of the
routing and charging decisions. Moreover, we illustrate how they can
efficiently be embedded in the pricing algorithm. The column generation
algorithm is integrated in a branch and bound algorithm and cutting planes are
added resulting in a branch-and-price-and-cut algorithm for the E-VRP-NL. Next
to the exact algorithm, we also develop a tabu search based heuristic to solve
the problem quickly. To prove the efficiency of the proposed algorithms, their
performance is tested on benchmark instances from the literature. Our exact
algorithm can optimally solve instances with up to 40 customers, including
several instances previously unsolved to optimality. The tabu search heuristic
proves to be superior to state-of-the-art heuristics in the literature both on
solution quality and computation times.

isodose surfaces (iso-surfaces), and to interactively tune dose distribution by
iso-surface dragging. Methods: We model volumetric dose distribution as
analytical extension of two iso-surfaces with the extension variables as
distances to iso-surfaces. We built a 3D lookup table (LUT) which are generated
based on clinical dose distributions. Two LUT tables store the mean and
standard deviation of voxel dose values of clinical doses and binned as
distance to 100% iso-surface, reference iso-surface and reference dose level.
The process of interactive tuning starts from a given base plan. A user drags
iso-surface for a desired carving. Our method responds with tuned dose. The
derivation of tuned dose follows two steps. Dose is extended from the two
user-desired iso-surfaces (eg.100% and 50%) to the whole patient volume by
table lookup, using distances to two iso-surfaces and reference dose level as
keys. Then we fine tune the extended dose by a correction strategy utilizing
the information of base plan. Results: We validated this method on coplanar
VMAT doses of post-operative prostate plans. The LUT was populated by dose
distributions of 27 clinical plans. We optimized two plans with different
rectum sparing for an independent case to mimic the process of dose tuning. The
plan with less rectum sparing is set as base plan. The 50% iso-surface of the
more-sparing plan is defined as the desired iso-surface input. The dose output
by our method (expansion and correction) agrees with the more-sparing plan
obtained by optimization, in terms of gamma (97.2%), DVH and profiles. The
overall dose reconstruction time is within two seconds. Conclusion: We
developed a distance-to-isosurface based volumetric dose reconstruction method,
and applied it to interactive tuning with iso-surface dragging.

and masses and use detailed spectrally-resolved, non-equilibrium models of the

$L_\mathrm{acc}$ for a given $L_\mathrm{H\alpha}$ than fits to young stellar
objects, because Ly-$\alpha$, which is not observable, carries a large fraction
of $L_\mathrm{acc}$. Specifically, an $L_\mathrm{H\alpha}$ measurement needs
ten to 100 times higher $L_\mathrm{acc}$ and $\dot{M}$ than previously
predicted, which may explain the rarity of planetary H$\alpha$ detections. We
also compare the $\dot{M}$--$L_\mathrm{H\alpha}$ relationships coming from the
planet-surface shock or implied by accretion-funnel emission. Both can
contribute simultaneously to an observed H$\alpha$ signal but at low (high)
$\dot{M}$ the planetary-surface shock (heated funnel) dominates. Only the shock

hole mergers in the second LIGO--Virgo gravitational-wave transient catalog,
updating the total number of binary black holes analysed for orbital
eccentricity to 36. Using the \texttt{SEOBNRE} waveform, we find the data for
GW190620A is poorly explained by the zero-eccentricity hypothesis (frequentist
$p$-value $\lesssim 0.1\%$). Using a log-uniform prior on eccentricity, the
eccentricity at $\unit[10]{Hz}$ for GW190620A is constrained to
$e_{10}\geq0.05$ ($0.1$) at $74\%$ ($65\%$) credibility. With this log-uniform

statistical support for non-zero eccentricity; the intermediate-mass black hole
merger GW190521 was the first. Interpretation of these two events is currently
complicated by waveform systematics; we are unable to simultaneously model the

Inspired by the idea of the RPCL, our method further enforces regulation on the

cells in obstacle-dense areas. Subsequently, the boundaries of these cells are
used for sampling; thus significantly reducing the burden of uniform sampling.
When compared with a standard uniform sampler, this smart sampler significantly
1) reduces the size of the sampling space while providing completeness and
optimality guarantee, 2) provides sparse sampling in obstacle-free regions and
dense sampling in obstacle-rich regions to facilitate faster exploration, and
3) eliminates the need for expensive collision-checking with obstacles due to
the convexity of the cells. This sampling framework is incorporated into the
RRT* path planner. The results show that RRT* with the non-uniform sampler

policy can be characterized as a $\textit{Markov decision process}$ (MDP) at
large, given that the system parameters evolve Markovian. The resulting optimal
reward can be defined as the weighted sum of mean power usage and mean delay of
requested jobs. For large-scale data centers however, these models become
intractable due to the colossal state-action space, thus making conventional
algorithms inefficient in finding the optimal policy. In this paper, we propose
an approximate $\textit{semi-MDP}$ (SMDP) approach, known as
`$\textit{multi-level SMDP}$', based on state aggregation and Markovian
analysis of the system behavior. Rather than averaging the transition
probabilities of aggregated states as in typical methods, we introduce an
approximate Markovian framework for calculating the transition probabilities of
the proposed multi-level SMDP accurately. Moreover, near-optimal performance
can be attained at the expense of increased state-space dimensionality by
tuning the number of levels in the multi-level approach. Simulation results
show that the proposed approach reduces the SMDP size while yielding better
rewards as against existing fixed threshold-based policies and aggregation

a flexible control mechanism to meet different demands of robustness and

three non-potential parameters including the length of steep gradient polarity
inversion line (L$_{SGPIL}$), the total photospheric free magnetic energy
(E$_{free}$) and the area with large shear angle (A$_{\Psi}$). We find that
confined flares tend to have larger values of L$_{SGPIL}$, E$_{free}$ and
A$_{\Psi}$ compared to eruptive flares. Each non-potential parameter shows a
moderate positive correlation with $\Phi$$_{AR}$. Our results imply that
$\Phi$$_{AR}$ is a decisive quantity describing the eruptive character of a
flare, as it provides a global parameter relating to the strength of the
background field confinement.

and fundamental and important in understanding topological and geometric
properties of the manifold of the domain. It is the graph and a topological
space endowed with a natural topology. This is defined as the quotient space of
the manifold of the domain where the equivalence relation is as follows: two
points in the manifold are equivalent if and only if they are in a same
connected component of a level set or a preimage. In considerable cases they
are graphs (Reeb graphs): if the function is a so-called Morse(-Bott) functions
for example, then this is the graph such that a point is a vertex if and only
if the corresponding connected component of the level set contains some
singular points.
  The author previously constructed explicit smooth functions on suitable
3-dimensional connected, closed and orientable manifolds whose Reeb graphs are
isomorphic to prescribed graphs and whose preimages are as prescribed types.
This gives a new answer to so-called realization problems of graphs as Reeb
graphs of smooth functions of suitable classes. The present paper concerns a
variant in the case where the 3-dimensional manifolds may not be non-orientable

molecular line mapping observations of the northeast jet of the young stellar

much more likely to indicate a twin-jet structure than jet rotation, as
previously hypothesized. The interpretation of the line of sight velocity
gradient across (perpendicular to its axis) the northeast jet of Fir6b in terms
of jet rotation leads to jet-launching radii of ~2-3AU. However, the velocities
of the jets ~100-400 km/s are much larger than the escape speed from these
radii. We argue that the northeast jet of FIR6b is instead compatible with a
twin-jet structure, as observed in some planetary nebulae. Specifically, we
find that the main, redshifted jet emanating from the central YSO is composed
of two, very closely aligned, narrower jets that were launched by the central
YSO at about the same time but at different inclinations with respect to the
plain of the sky. This twin-jet structure removes the extreme requirement that
jets with velocities similar to the escape velocity from the YSO be launched
from very large radii. The YSO FIR6b and certain planetary nebulae also share
the characteristics of unequal structures and intensities of their two opposing
bipolar jets. We propose that such opposing lobe asymmetries can result from a
sub-stellar binary companion on an eccentric orbit that is inclined to the
accretion disk plane.

entirely data-driven Python package for building reduced order or surrogate

several tools for building and interacting with surrogate models in a

the Reduced Basis approach and the Empirical Interpolation Method along a
classic regression stage for surrogate modelling. We illustrate the simplicity

state-transition model of state variables. However, under highly dynamic
conditions in the operation of microgrids and active distribution networks,
this approach may become ineffective as the forecasting accuracy is not
guaranteed. To overcome such drawbacks, this paper employs the power networks
model derived from the physical equations of branch currents. Specifically, the
power network model is a linear state-space model, in which the state vector
consists of branch currents, and the input vector consists of bus voltages. To
estimate both state and input variables, we propose linear Kalman-based dynamic
filtering algorithms in batch-mode regression form, considering the
cross-correlation between states and inputs. For the scalability of the
proposed scheme, the distributed implementation is also presented.
Complementarily, the predicted state and input vectors are leveraged for bad
data detection. Results carried out on a 13-bus microgrid system in real-time
Opal-RT platform demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in
comparison with the traditional weighted least square and tracking state
estimation methods.

conjugate G-Wishart prior distribution on the precision matrix is expensive for
general non-decomposable graphs. We therefore propose a new Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) method named the G-Wishart weighted proposal algorithm (WWA).
WWA's distinctive features include delayed acceptance MCMC, Gibbs updates for
the precision matrix and an informed proposal distribution on the graph space
that enables embarrassingly parallel computations. Compared to existing
approaches, WWA reduces the frequency of the relatively expensive sampling from
the G-Wishart distribution. This results in faster MCMC convergence, improved
MCMC mixing and reduced computing time. Numerical studies on simulated and real
data show that WWA provides a more efficient tool for posterior inference than
competing state-of-the-art MCMC algorithms.

8,431 cores with the dust continuum maps of the Cygnus X giant molecular cloud
complex, and design a procedure for deriving the CMF considering the mass
uncertainty, binning uncertainty, sample incompleteness, and the statistical
errors. The resultant CMF coincides well with the IMF for core masses from a
few $M_{\odot}$ to the highest masses of 1300 $M_{\odot}$ with a power-law of
${\rm d}N/{\rm d}M\propto M^{-2.30\pm0.04}$, but does not present an obvious
flattened turnover in the low-mass range as the IMF does. More detailed
inspection reveals that the slope of the CMF steepens with increasing mass.
Given the numerous high-mass star-forming activities of Cygnus X, this is in
stark contrast with the existing top-heavy CMFs found in high-mass star-forming
clumps. We also find that the similarity between the IMF and the mass function
of cloud structures is not unique at core scales, but can be seen for cloud
structures of up to several pc scales. Finally, our SMA observations toward a

type energy \[

This energy is defined on tangent vector fields on a $2$-dimensional closed and
oriented Riemannian manifold $M$ (here $D$ stands for the covariant derivative)
and depends on a small parameter $\varepsilon>0$. If the energy satisfies
proper bounds, when $\varepsilon\to 0$ the second term forces the vector fields
to have unit length. However, due to the incompatibility for vector fields on
$M$ between the Sobolev regularity and the unit norm constraint, critical
points of $F_\varepsilon$ tend to generate a finite number of singular points
(called vortices) having non-zero index (when the Euler characteristic is
non-zero). These types of problems have been extensively analyzed in a recent
paper by R. Ignat and R. Jerrard. As in Euclidean case, the position of the
vortices is ruled by the so-called renormalized energy.
  In this paper we are interested in the dynamics of vortices. We rigorously
prove that the vortices move according to the gradient flow of the renormalized
energy, which is the limit behavior when $\varepsilon\to 0$ of the gradient
flow of the Ginzburg-Landau energy.

significant attention over the last decade. Whilst the vast majority of studies
have revolved around conditions where the resonator exhibits strong anomalous
dispersion, recent studies have shown that solitons with unique characteristics
and dynamics can arise under conditions of near-zero-dispersion driving. Here
we report on experimental studies of the existence and stability dynamics of
Kerr CSs under such conditions. In particular, we experimentally probe the
solitons' range of existence and examine how their breathing instabilities are
modified when group-velocity dispersion is close to zero, such that
higher-order dispersion terms play a significant role. On the one hand, our
experiments directly confirm earlier theoretical works that predict (i)
breathing near-zero-dispersion solitons to emit polychromatic dispersive
radiation, and (ii) that higher-order dispersion can extend the range over
which the solitons are stable. On the other hand, our experiments also reveal a
novel cross-over scenario, whereby the influence of higher-order dispersion
changes from stabilising to destabilising. Our comprehensive experiments sample
soliton dynamics both in the normal and anomalous dispersion regimes, and our
results are in good agreement with numerical simulations and theoretical
predictions.

Newman Penrose Formalism, in which gravitational waves are described as
perturbations in the Weyl scalars $\psi_0$ and $\psi_4$, with the governing
equation being the well-known Teukolsky equation. Near infinity and near
horizon, $\psi_4$ is dominated by the component that corresponds to waves
propagating towards the positive radial direction, while $\psi_0$ is dominated
by the component that corresponds to waves that propagate towards the negative
radial direction. Since gravitational-wave detectors measure out-going waves at
infinity, research has been mainly focused on $\psi_4$, leaving $\psi_0$ less
studied. But the scenario is reversed in the near horizon region where the
in-going-wave boundary condition needs to be imposed. Thus, the near horizon
phenomena, e.g., tidal heating and gravitational-wave echoes from Extremely
Compact Objects (ECOs), require computing $\psi_0$. In this work, we explicitly
calculate the source term for the $\psi_0$ Teukolsky equation due to a point
particle plunging into a Kerr black hole. We highlight the need to regularize
the solution of the $\psi_0$ Teukolsky equation obtained using Green's function
techniques. We suggest a regularization scheme for this purpose and go on to
compute the $\psi_0$ waveform close to a Schwarzschild horizon for two types of
trajectories of the in-falling particle. We compare the $\psi_0$ waveform
calculated directly from the Teukolsky equation with the $\psi_0$ waveform
obtained by using the Starobinsky-Teukolsky identity on $\psi_4$. We also
compute the out-going echo waveform near infinity, using the near-horizon
$\psi_0$ computed directly from the Teukolsky equation and the Boltzmann
boundary condition on the ECO surface. We show that this echo is quantitatively
different (stronger) than the echo obtained using previous prescriptions.

signatures are too costly, while using $3f{+}1$ replicas is uneconomical ($f$

reduce the number of replicas to $2f{+}1$ and minimize the number of
signatures. While the first goal can be achieved in the message-and-memory
model, accomplishing the second goal simultaneously is challenging. We first
address this challenge for the problem of broadcasting messages reliably. We
consider two variants of this problem, Consistent Broadcast and Reliable
Broadcast, typically considered very close. Perhaps surprisingly, we establish
a separation between them in terms of signatures required. In particular, we
show that Consistent Broadcast requires at least 1 signature in some execution,
while Reliable Broadcast requires $O(n)$ signatures in some execution. We
present matching upper bounds for both primitives within constant factors. We
then turn to the problem of consensus and argue that this separation matters
for solving consensus with Byzantine failures: we present a practical consensus
algorithm that uses Consistent Broadcast as its main communication primitive.
This algorithm works for $n=2f{+}1$ and avoids signatures in the common-case --
properties that have not been simultaneously achieved previously. Overall, our
work approaches Byzantine computing in a frugal manner and motivates the use of
Consistent Broadcast -- rather than Reliable Broadcast -- as a key primitive
for reaching agreement.

of over-dense regions may contribute a significant amount to the present dark
matter relic density. Inflation provides a natural framework for the production
mechanism of primordial blackholes. For example, single field inflation models
with a fine-tuned scalar potential may exhibit a period of ultra-slow roll,
during which the curvature perturbation may be enhanced to become seeds of the
primordial blackholes formed as the corresponding scales reenter the horizon.
In this work, we propose an alternative mechanism for the primordial blackhole
formation. We consider a model in which a scalar field is coupled to the
Gauss-Bonnet term and show that primordial blackholes may be seeded when a
scalar potential term and the Gauss-Bonnet coupling term are nearly balanced.
Large curvature perturbation in this model not only leads to the production of
primordial blackholes but it also sources gravitational waves at the second
order. We calculate the present density parameter of the gravitational waves
and discuss the detectability of the signals by comparing them with sensitivity
bounds of future gravitational wave experiments.

  Majority in Blockchains",,,,,"cs.CR cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Fault tolerance of a blockchain is often characterized by the fraction $f$ of
""adversarial power"" that it can tolerate in the system. Despite the fast
progress in blockchain designs in recent years, existing blockchain systems can
still only tolerate $f$ below $0.5$. Can practically usable blockchains
tolerate a malicious majority, i.e., $f$ above $0.5$?
  This work presents a positive answer to this question. We first note that the
well-known impossibility of {\em byzantine consensus} for $f$ above $0.5$ does
not carry over to blockchains. To tolerate $f$ above $0.5$, we use {\em
byzantine broadcast}, instead of byzantine consensus, as the core of the
blockchain. A major obstacle in doing so, however, is that the resulting
blockchain may have extremely low throughput. To overcome this central
technical challenge, we propose a novel byzantine broadcast protocol OverlayBB,
that can tolerate $f$ above $0.5$ while achieving good throughput. Using
OverlayBB as the core, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of
a novel Proof-of-Stake blockchain called BCube. BCube can tolerate a malicious
majority, while achieving practically usable transaction throughput and
confirmation latency in our experiments with $10000$ nodes and under $f = 0.7$.
To our knowledge, BCube is the first blockchain that can achieve such
properties.

named Intra- and Inter-Instance Collaborative Learning (I3CL). Specifically, to
address the first issue, we design an effective convolutional module with
multiple receptive fields, which is able to collaboratively learn better
character and gap feature representations at local and long ranges inside a
text instance. To address the second issue, we devise an instance-based
transformer module to exploit the dependencies between different text instances
and a global context module to exploit the semantic context from the shared
background, which are able to collaboratively learn more discriminative text
feature representation. In this way, I3CL can effectively exploit the intra-

framework. Besides, to make full use of the unlabeled data, we design an
effective semi-supervised learning method to leverage the pseudo labels via an
ensemble strategy. Without bells and whistles, experimental results show that

comprehensive semantic information in the training phase, whilst improving the
performance of the final prediction module. On the other hand, considering the
existence of errors in the pseudo labels, we propose a novel label reassign
loss to mitigate over-fitting. Extensive experiments are conducted on the

resistive-magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a relaxing braided magnetic field

that line helicity will be predominantly redistributed within the domain,
rather than annihilated. Secondly, we show that self-organization into a
relaxed state with two discrete flux tubes may be predicted from the initial
line helicity distribution. Thirdly, for this set of line-tied simulations we
observe that the sub-structure within each of the final tubes is a state of
uniform line helicity. This uniformization of line helicity is consistent with
Taylor theory applied to each tube individually. However, it is striking that
the line helicity becomes significantly more uniform than the force-free

the three circumstellar disks are almost parallel to that of the orbital motion
of the binary system. Their mutual gravito-hydrodynamical interaction for the
subsequent $\sim10^4\thinspace\rm{yr}$ greatly disturbs the orbit of the

reversed due to the spiral-arm accretion of the circumbinary disk. The

long-lived massive remnant NS, which has been previously suggested to explain
the AT 2017gfo kilonova emission in the famous GW170817 event. For an
NS-affected kilonova, it is expected that a non-thermal emission component can
be contributed by a pulsar wind nebula (PWN), which results from the
interaction of the wind from the remnant NS with the preceding merger ejecta.
Then, the discovery of such a non-thermal PWN emission can provide an evidence
for the existence of the remnant NS. Similar to GRB 170817A, GRB 160821B is
also one of the nearest short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs). A candidate kilonova is
widely believed to appear in the ultraviolet-optical-infrared afterglows of GRB
160821B. Here, by modeling the afterglow light curves and spectra of GRB
160821B, we find that the invoking of a non-thermal PWN emission can indeed be
well consistent with the observational data. This may indicate that the
formation of a stable massive NS could be not rare in the DNS merger events
and, thus, the equation of state of the post-merger NSs should be stiff enough.

brain activities. Plenty of works have studied the patterns and attention
allocations of reading comprehension in information retrieval related
scenarios. However, little is known about what happens in human brain during
reading comprehension and how these cognitive activities can affect information
retrieval process. Additionally, with the advances in brain imaging techniques
such as electroencephalogram (EEG), it is possible to collect brain signals in
almost real time and explore whether it can be utilized as feedback to
facilitate information acquisition performance. In this paper, we carefully
design a lab-based user study to investigate brain activities during reading
comprehension. Our findings show that neural responses vary with different
types of reading contents, i.e., contents that can satisfy users' information
needs and contents that cannot. We suggest that various cognitive activities,
e.g., cognitive loading, semantic-thematic understanding, and inferential
processing, underpin these neural responses at the micro-time scale during
reading comprehension. From these findings, we illustrate several insights for
information retrieval tasks, such as ranking models construction and interface
design. Besides, we suggest the possibility of detecting reading comprehension
status for a proactive real-world system. To this end, we propose a Unified
framework for EEG-based Reading Comprehension Modeling (UERCM). To verify its
effectiveness, we conduct extensive experiments based on EEG features for two
reading comprehension tasks: answer sentence classification and answer
extraction. Results show that it is feasible to improve the performance of two
tasks with brain signals.

automatically generating or manipulating images from text descriptions.
Prevailing methods mainly use the text as conditions for GAN generation, and
train different models for the text-guided image generation and manipulation
tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel unified framework of Cycle-consistent
Inverse GAN (CI-GAN) for both text-to-image generation and text-guided image
manipulation tasks. Specifically, we first train a GAN model without text
input, aiming to generate images with high diversity and quality. Then we learn
a GAN inversion model to convert the images back to the GAN latent space and
obtain the inverted latent codes for each image, where we introduce the
cycle-consistency training to learn more robust and consistent inverted latent
codes. We further uncover the latent space semantics of the trained GAN model,
by learning a similarity model between text representations and the latent
codes. In the text-guided optimization module, we generate images with the
desired semantic attributes by optimizing the inverted latent codes. Extensive
experiments on the Recipe1M and CUB datasets validate the efficacy of our
proposed framework.

Each mode comprises a fixed spatial pattern whose amplitude varies in time,
identified by a month-by-month empirical orthogonal function separation of
surface measured magnetic field variance. Here we focus on four sets of modes
that have been previously identified as DPY, DP2, NBZ, and DP1. We derive the
cross-correlation function of each mode set with either IMF (B$_{y}$) or
(B$_{z}$) for lags ranging from -10 to +600 mins with respect to the IMF state
at the bow shock nose. For all four sets of modes, the average correlation can
be reproduced by a sum of up to three linear responses to the IMF component,
each centered on a different lag. These are interpreted as the statistical
ionospheric responses to magnetopause merging (15- to 20-min lag) and
magnetotail reconnection (60-min lag) and to IMF persistence. Of the mode sets,
NBZ and DPY are the most predictable from a given IMF component, with DP1 (the
substorm component) the least predictable. The proportion of mode variability
explained by the IMF increases for the longer lags, thought to indicate
conductivity feedbacks from substorms. In summary, we confirm the postulated
physical basis of these modes and quantify their multiple reconfiguration
timescales.

periodic boundary conditions (PBC). This is unlike known non-Hermitian models

provide a route towards the NHSE caused by asymmetric hopping textures, rather

the huge computational cost is still a severe issue. Since the computation
complexity of ViT is quadratic with respect to the input sequence length, a
mainstream paradigm for computation reduction is to reduce the number of
tokens. Existing designs include structured spatial compression that uses a
progressive shrinking pyramid to reduce the computations of large feature maps,
and unstructured token pruning that dynamically drops redundant tokens.
However, the limitation of existing token pruning lies in two folds: 1) the
incomplete spatial structure caused by pruning is not compatible with
structured spatial compression that is commonly used in modern deep-narrow
transformers; 2) it usually requires a time-consuming pre-training procedure.
To tackle the limitations and expand the applicable scenario of token pruning,
we present Evo-ViT, a self-motivated slow-fast token evolution approach for
vision transformers. Specifically, we conduct unstructured instance-wise token
selection by taking advantage of the simple and effective global class
attention that is native to vision transformers. Then, we propose to update the
selected informative tokens and uninformative tokens with different computation
paths, namely, slow-fast updating. Since slow-fast updating mechanism maintains
the spatial structure and information flow, Evo-ViT can accelerate vanilla
transformers of both flat and deep-narrow structures from the very beginning of
the training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly reduces the computational cost of vision transformers while
maintaining comparable performance on image classification.

produce a catalogue of BSSs using Gaia DR2 data. Among the 670 clusters older

208 clusters. In general, all clusters older than 1 Gyr and massive than 1000
Msun have BSSs. The average number of BSSs increases with cluster age and mass,
and there is a power-law relation between the cluster mass and the maximum
number of BSSs in the cluster. We introduce the term fractional mass excess
(Me) for BSSs. We find that at least 54\% of BSSs have Me $<$ 0.5 (likely to
have gained mass through a binary mass transfer (MT)), 30\% in the $1.0 <$ Me
$< 0.5$ range (likely to have gained mass through a merger) and up to 16\% with
Me $>$ 1.0 (likely from multiple mergers/MT). We also find that the percentage
of low Me BSSs increases with age, beyond 1--2 Gyr, suggesting an increase in
formation through MT in older clusters. The BSSs are radially segregated, and
the extent of segregation depends on the dynamical relaxation of the cluster.

the generation of photon pairs with factorable, positively-correlated, and

the temperature dependence of the dynamical spin structure factor of Heisenberg
ferromagnetic spin chains. For spin-1/2, we show that the bound state appears
as a well defined excitation with significant spectral weight in the

of detecting it with inelastic neutron scattering near $k=\pi$ provided the
temperature is neither too low nor too high - at low temperature, the spectral
weight only grows as $T^{3/2}$, and at high temperature the bound state peak
merges with the two-magnon continuum. For spin-1, the situation is more subtle
because the bound state with two neighboring spin flips competes with an
anti-bound state with two spin-flips on the same site. As a consequence, the
relative spectral weight of the bound state is smaller than for spin-1/2, and a
weak resonance due to the anti-bound state appears in the continuum. A clearer
signature of the bound state (resp. anti-bound state) can be obtained if a
negative (resp. positive) biquadratic interaction is present.

description of neural networks in terms of a Wilsonian effective field theory.
The infinite-width limit is mapped to a free field theory, while finite $N$
corrections are taken into account by interactions (non-Gaussian terms in the
action). In this paper, we study two related aspects of this correspondence.
First, we comment on the concepts of locality and power-counting in this
context. Indeed, these usual space-time notions may not hold for neural
networks (since inputs can be arbitrary), however, the renormalization group
provides natural notions of locality and scaling. Moreover, we comment on
several subtleties, for example, that data components may not have a
permutation symmetry: in that case, we argue that random tensor field theories
could provide a natural generalization. Second, we improve the perturbative
Wilsonian renormalization from arXiv:2008.08601 by providing an analysis in
terms of the nonperturbative renormalization group using the Wetterich-Morris
equation. An important difference with usual nonperturbative RG analysis is
that only the effective (IR) 2-point function is known, which requires setting
the problem with care. Our aim is to provide a useful formalism to investigate
neural networks behavior beyond the large-width limit (i.e.~far from Gaussian
limit) in a nonperturbative fashion. A major result of our analysis is that
changing the standard deviation of the neural network weight distribution can
be interpreted as a renormalization flow in the space of networks. We focus on
translations invariant kernels and provide preliminary numerical results.

models as well as with the $\Lambda$CDM model in some respects in the early or
very early phases of the universe. It could predict the present accelerated
expansion of the universe somewhat differently from the other models with a
peculiar future history of the universe. Within a constrained range of
parameters all models show a good agreement with the Union2.1 luminosity
distance data. However, the new model shows a quite satisfactory agreement in
the whole range of its allowed parameters than that of the other two models. We
also obtain cosmological constraints on these models from the Observed Hubble
Data. Further, models have been tested by using $Om(z)$ test and statefinder
diagnostics. These diagnostics especially, the statefinder diagnostic shows
that the evolutionary differences between these models are distinct. The
evolutionary trajectories of the new model are completely different from the

amount of work. Typically, this task involves synthesis, coloring, and
placement of 3D models within the game scene. To lessen this workload, we can
apply machine learning to automate some aspects of the game scene development.
Earlier research has already tackled automated generation of the game scene
background with machine learning. However, model auto-coloring remains an
underexplored problem. The automatic coloring of a 3D model is a challenging
task, especially when dealing with the digital representation of a colorful,
multipart object. In such a case, we have to ``understand'' the object's
composition and coloring scheme of each part. Existing single-stage methods
have their own caveats such as the need for segmentation of the object or
generating individual parts that have to be assembled together to yield the
final model. We address these limitations by proposing a two-stage training
approach to synthesize auto-colored 3D models. In the first stage, we obtain a
3D point cloud representing a 3D object, whilst in the second stage, we assign
colors to points within such cloud. Next, by leveraging the so-called
triangulation trick, we generate a 3D mesh in which the surfaces are colored
based on interpolation of colored points representing vertices of a given mesh
triangle. This approach allows us to generate a smooth coloring scheme.
Experimental evaluation shows that our two-stage approach gives better results
in terms of shape reconstruction and coloring when compared to traditional
single-stage techniques.

so that we can verify whether the previous success is repeatable. The
prediction shows that Cycle 25 would be about 10% stronger than Cycle 24 with
an amplitude of 126 (international sunspot number version 2.0). The result
suggests that Cycle 25 will not enter the Maunder-like grand solar minimum as

Non-condensed, thermal particles are present as well. The approach holds for
masses exceeding 0.75 $10^{-4}M_\odot$. The inner horizon sets an inner core of
11 cm, while the characteristic radius of the full core is 270

extremal case, it fills the interior. While the net charge is easily shielded,
the build up of horizons may prevent this in the interior, and consequently
avoid a singularity. In black hole merging, the core of a nearly extremal one
may be exposed, forming a new class of events. The approach is a stepping stone

detection. Given the prevalence and challenges of sarcasm in sentiment-bearing
text, this is a critical phase in most sentiment analysis tasks. With the
increasing popularity and usage of different social media platforms among users
around the world, people are using sarcasm more and more in their day-to-day

people to express their sentiment about some certain topics or issues. As a
result of the increasing popularity, researchers started to focus their
research endeavors on detecting sarcasm from a text in different languages
especially the English language. However, the task of sarcasm detection is a
challenging task due to the nature of sarcastic texts; which can be relative
and significantly differs from one person to another depending on the topic,
region, the user's mentality and other factors. In addition to these
challenges, sarcasm detection in the Arabic language has its own challenges due
to the complexity of the Arabic language, such as being morphologically rich,
with many dialects that significantly vary between each other, while also being
lowly resourced. In recent years, only few research attempts started tackling
the task of sarcasm detection in Arabic, including creating and collecting
corpora, organizing workshops and establishing baseline models. This paper
intends to create a new humanly annotated Arabic corpus for sarcasm detection
collected from tweets, and implementing a new approach for sarcasm detection
and quantification in Arabic tweets. The annotation technique followed in this
paper is unique in sarcasm detection and the proposed approach tackles the
problem as a regression problem instead of classification; i.e., the model
attempts to predict the level of sarcasm instead of binary classification.

their wettability in response to light or an electrostatic field. Here, we
investigate a droplet on substrates with oscillating uniform wettability by
varying minimium and maximum contact angles and frequency. To simulate this
situation, we use our previous work [Grawitter and Stark, Soft Matter 17, 2454
(2021)], where we implemented the boundary element method in combination with
the Cox-Voinov law for the contact-line velocity, to determine the fluid flow
inside a droplet. After a transient regime the droplet performs steady
oscillations, the amplitude of which decreases with increasing frequency. For
slow oscillations our numerical results agree well with the linearized
spherical-cap model. They collapse on a master curve when we rescale frequency
by a characteristic relaxation time. In contrast, for fast oscillations we
observe significant deviations from the master curve. The decay of the
susceptibility is weaker and the phase shift between oscillations in
wettability and contact angle stays below the predicted $\pi/2$. The reason
becomes obvious when studying the combined dynamics of droplet height and
contact angle. It reveals non-reciprocal shape changes during one oscillation
period even at low frequencies due to the induced fluid flow inside the
droplet, which are not captured by the spherical-cap model. Similar periodic
non-reciprocal shape changes occur at low frequencies when the droplet is
placed on an oscillating nonuniform wettability profile with six-fold symmetry.
Such profiles are inspired by the light intensity pattern of Laguerre-Gauss
laser modes. Since the non-reciprocal shape changes induce fluid circulation,
which is controllable from the outside, our findings envisage to design
targeted microfluidic transport of solutes inside the droplet.

states of matter. In particular, multiorbital systems have the potential to
host exotic non-unitary superconducting states. While the microscopic origin of
non-unitarity is not yet fully solved, competing interactions are suggested to
play a crucial role in stabilizing such states. The interplay between charge
order and superconductivity has been a recurring theme in unconventionally
superconducting systems, ranging from cuprate-based superconductors to
dichalcogenide systems and even to twisted van der Waals materials. Here, we
demonstrate that the existence of competing interactions gives rise to a
non-unitary superconducting state. We show that the non-unitarity stems from a
competing charge-ordered state whose interplay with superconductivity promotes
a non-trivial multiorbital order. We establish this mechanism both from a
Ginzburg-Landau perspective, and also from a fully microscopic selfconsistent
solution of a multiorbital Dirac material. Our results put forward competing
interactions as a powerful mechanism for driving non-unitary multiorbital

the spin-1/2 system to a Manakov system. We employ both analytical and
numerical methods to solve the resulting Manakov system. Using a generalized
similarity transformation, we reduce the two-dimensional Manakov system to the
integrable one-dimensional Manakov system. Solutions obtained in this manner
diverge at the origin. We employ a power series method to obtain an infinite
family of localized and nondiverging solutions characterized by a finite number
of nodes. A numerical method is then used to obtain a family of localized
oscillatory solutions with an infinite number of nodes corresponding to a
skyrmion composed of concentric rings with intensities alternating between the
two components of the spinor. We investigate the stability of the skyrmion
solutions found here by calculating their energy functional in terms of their
effective size. It turns out that indeed the skyrmion is most stable when the
phase difference between the concentric rings is $\pi$, i.e., alternating
between spin up and spin down. Our results are also applicable to doubly
polarized optical pulses.

semidefinite programming problems (SDPs). In the optimization community, it is
well-known that a convex optimization problem satisfies strong duality if the
Slater's condition holds. However, this result cannot be directly generalized
to non-convex problems. In this paper, we prove that a class of non-convex SDPs
with special structures satisfies strong duality under the Slater's condition.
Such a class of SDPs arises in SDP-based control analysis and design
approaches. Throughout the paper, several examples are given to support the
proposed results. We expect that the proposed analysis can potentially deepen
our understanding of non-convex SDPs arising in the control community, and
promote their analysis based on KKT conditions.

broken and the energy spectrum of a confined system such as a quantum dot,
becomes rather complex exhibiting many irregular level crossings and small
energy spacings which are very sensitive to the applied magnetic field. Here we
study the energy spectrum of a graphene quantum dot that is formed between
Landau levels, and show that for the appropriate potential well the dot energy
spectrum in the first Landau gap can have a simple pattern with energies coming
from one of the two valleys only. This part of the spectrum has no crossings,
has specific angular momentum numbers, and the energy spacing can be large
enough, consequently, it can be probed with standard spectroscopic techniques.
The magnetic field dependence of the dot levels as well as the effect of the
mass-induced energy gap are examined, and some regimes leading to a
controllable quantum dot are specified. At high magnetic fields and negative
angular momentum a simple approximate method to the Dirac equation is developed
which gives further insight into the physics. The approximate energies exhibit
the correct trends and agree well with the exact energies.

Rashba effect is manifested by the splitting of optical states with opposite
chirality in the momentum space. Previous realizations of the optical Rashba
effect relied on passive devices determining either the propagation direction
of surface plasmons or circularly polarized light into nanostructures, or the
directional emission of polarized luminescence from metamaterials hybridized
with light-emitting media. Here we demonstrate an active device underpinned by
the optical Rashba effect, in which a monolithic halide perovskite metasurface
emits highly directional chiral photoluminescence. An all-dielectric

Cauchy horizon never forms in presence of a non-trivial scalar hair, although,
in absence of it, the black hole solution has an inner horizon due to the
finite graviton mass. We show that the instability of the Cauchy horizon
triggered by the scalar field is associated to a rapid collapse of the
Einstein-Rosen bridge. The corresponding flows run smoothly through the event
horizon and at late times end in a spacelike singularity at which the
asymptotic geometry takes a general Kasner form dominated by the scalar hair
kinetic term. Interestingly, we discover deviations from the simple Kasner
universe whenever the potential terms become larger than the kinetic one.
Finally, we study the effects of the scalar deformation and the graviton mass
on the Kasner singularity exponents and show the relationship between the
Kasner exponents and the entanglement and butterfly velocities probing the
black hole dynamics. Differently from the holographic superconductor case, we

techniques are being used wherein the data from dense domain(source) is

cross-domain recommendation when both domains have no overlap of users and

efficient approach to simulate many-body quantum systems is the use of
classical approximation. However, it is known that at least at low
temperatures, the allowed spin fluctuations in this approach are overestimated
what results in enhanced thermal fluctuations. It is therefore timely and
important to assess the validity of the classical approximation. To this end,
in this work, we compare the results of numerical calculations of small
Mn$^{3+}$ magnetic clusters in GaN, where the Mn spins are treated classically
with those where they are treated quantum-mechanically (crystal field model).
In the first case, we solve the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation that

deposited liquid film is calculated within the lubrication approximation
accounting for the finiteness of the film length, i.e. for the presence of the
contact line. The latter is assumed to be pinned on a surface defect and thus
immobile; the contact angle is allowed to vary. The fluid flow effect on the
curvature in the central meniscus part is neglected. This curvature varies in
time because of the film variation and is determined as a part of the solution.
The film dynamics depends on the initial contact angle, which is the maximal
contact angle attained during oscillation. The average film thickness is
studied as a function of system parameters. The numerical results are compared
to existing experimental data and to the results of the quasi-steady
approximation. Finally, the problem of an oscillating meniscus is considered
accounting for the superheating of the capillary wall with respect to the
saturation temperature, which causes evaporation. When the superheating exceeds
a quite low threshold, oscillations with a pinned contact line are impossible
and the contact line recession caused by evaporation needs to be accounted for.

locomotion system including the nonlinear active compliance control and the
active impedance control for the steel wire transmission-based legged robot.
The developed control system enables high-speed dynamic locomotion with
excellent impact mitigation and leg position tracking performance, where three
strategies are applied. a) The feed-forward controller is designed according to
the linear motor-leg model with the information of Coulomb friction and viscous
friction. b) Steel wire transmission model-based compensation guarantees ideal
virtual spring compliance characteristics. c) Nonlinear active compliance
control and active impedance control ensure better impact mitigation
performance than linear scheme and guarantee position tracking performance. The
proposed control system is verified on a real robot named SCIT Dog and the
experiment demonstrates the ideal impact mitigation ability in high-speed
dynamic locomotion without any passive spring mechanism.

remote unit outside the telescope. The short focal length of the telescope
requires an accurate positioning of the sensors within +-50 mu along the
optical axis, with a flatness of +-10 mu. While the telescope will be at around

""which sensor-algorithm combination is best suited for a person detection task

conducting a systematic cross-modal analysis of sensor-algorithm combinations
typically used in robotics. We compare the performance of state-of-the-art
person detectors for 2D range data, 3D lidar, and RGB-D data as well as
selected combinations thereof in a challenging industrial use-case.
  We further address the related problems of data scarcity in the industrial
target domain, and that recent research on human detection in 3D point clouds
has mostly focused on autonomous driving scenarios. To leverage these
methodological advances for robotics applications, we utilize a simple, yet
effective multi-sensor transfer learning strategy by extending a strong
image-based RGB-D detector to provide cross-modal supervision for lidar
detectors in the form of weak 3D bounding box labels.

detection performance, generalization, frame rates and computational

this paper, we defend the problem setting for improving localization
performance by leveraging the bounding box regression knowledge from a
well-annotated auxiliary dataset. First, we use the well-annotated auxiliary
dataset to explore a series of learnable bounding box adjusters (LBBAs) in a
multi-stage training manner, which is class-agnostic. Then, only LBBAs and a
weakly-annotated dataset with non-overlapped classes are used for training
LBBA-boosted WSOD. As such, our LBBAs are practically more convenient and
economical to implement while avoiding the leakage of the auxiliary
well-annotated dataset. In particular, we formulate learning bounding box
adjusters as a bi-level optimization problem and suggest an EM-like multi-stage
training algorithm. Then, a multi-stage scheme is further presented for
LBBA-boosted WSOD. Additionally, a masking strategy is adopted to improve
proposal classification. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our
method. Our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art WSOD methods and

external strain is essential for their applications in flexible
opto-electronic, light-emitting and photovoltaic devices. While prior studies
have highlighted the impact of static strains applied on a macroscopic length
scale, assessing the effect of a local transient deformation before structural
relaxation occurs is challenging due to the required high spatio-temporal
resolution.
  Here, we employ scanning ultrafast electron microscopy (SUEM) to image the
dynamical effect of a photo-induced transient strain in the archetypal
semiconducting polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). We observe that the
photo-induced SUEM contrast, corresponding to the local change of secondary
electron emission, exhibits a ring-shaped spatial profile with a rise time of
$\sim 300$ ps, beyond which the profile persists in the absence of a spatial
diffusion. We attribute the observation to the electronic structure modulation
of P3HT caused by a photo-induced strain field owing to its relatively low
modulus and strong electron-lattice coupling, as supported by a finite-element
analysis. Our work provides insights into tailoring opto-electronic properties
using transient mechanical deformation in semiconducting polymers, and
demonstrates the versatility of SUEM to study photo-physical processes in
diverse materials.

  Properties of Binary Session Types",,,,,"cs.LO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Many properties of communication protocols combine safety and liveness
aspects. Characterizing such combined properties by means of a single inference
system is difficult because of the fundamentally different techniques
(coinduction and induction, respectively) usually involved in defining and
proving them. In this paper we show that Generalized Inference Systems allow us
to obtain sound and complete characterizations of (at least some of) these
combined inductive/coinductive properties of binary session types. In
particular, we illustrate the role of corules in characterizing fair
termination (the property of protocols that can always eventually terminate),
fair compliance (the property of interactions that can always be extended to
reach client satisfaction) and fair subtyping, a liveness-preserving refinement
relation for session types. The characterizations we obtain are simpler
compared to the previously available ones and corules provide insight on the
liveness properties being ensured or preserved. Moreover, we can conveniently
appeal to the bounded coinduction principle to prove the completeness of the
provided characterizations.

as washing machines, heat pumps, and solar panels, understanding the electric
energy consumption and production data at the granularity of the device helps
end-users be closer to the system and further achieve the sustainability of
energy use. However, many datasets in this area are isolated from other domains
with records of only energy-related data. This may raise a loss of information
(e.g. weather) that is relevant to the energy use of each device. A noticeable
disadvantage is that many of those datasets have to be used in computational
modeling approaches such as machine learning models, which are vulnerable to
the data feed, to advance the understanding of energy consumption and
production. Although such computational methods have achieved a high benchmark
merely through a local view of datasets, the reusability cannot be firmly
guaranteed when the information omission is taken into account. This paper
addresses the data isolation problem in the smart energy systems area by
exploring Semantic Web techniques on top of a household energy system. We
propose an ontology modeling solution for the management of decentralized data
at the resolution of a device in the system. As a result, the scope of the data
concerning each device can be easily extended to be wider across the web and
more information that may be of interest such as weather can be retrieved from
the Web if the data are structured by the ontology.

artery stenosis cannot satisfy the clinical needs, e.g., there is no prior
study of detecting stenoses in prespecified vessel segments, which is necessary
in clinical practice. Two vascular stenosis detection methods are proposed to
assist the diagnosis. The first one is an automatic method, which can
automatically extract the entire coronary artery tree and mark all the possible
stenoses. The second one is an interactive method. With this method, the user
can choose any vessel segment to do further analysis of its stenoses.
Experiments show that the proposed methods are robust for angiograms with
various vessel structures. The precision, sensitivity, and $F_1$ score of the
automatic stenosis detection method are 0.821, 0.757, and 0.788, respectively.
Further investigation proves that the interactive method can provide a more

and can complement each other in clinical practice. The first method can be
used for preliminary screening, and the second method can be used for further

Samworth","High-dimensional changepoint estimation with heterogeneous missingness","36 pages, 4 figures",,,,"stat.ME math.ST stat.TH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We propose a new method for changepoint estimation in partially-observed,
high-dimensional time series that undergo a simultaneous change in mean in a
sparse subset of coordinates. Our first methodological contribution is to
introduce a 'MissCUSUM' transformation (a generalisation of the popular
Cumulative Sum statistics), that captures the interaction between the signal
strength and the level of missingness in each coordinate. In order to borrow
strength across the coordinates, we propose to project these MissCUSUM
statistics along a direction found as the solution to a penalised optimisation
problem tailored to the specific sparsity structure. The changepoint can then
be estimated as the location of the peak of the absolute value of the projected
univariate series. In a model that allows different missingness probabilities
in different component series, we identify that the key interaction between the
missingness and the signal is a weighted sum of squares of the signal change in
each coordinate, with weights given by the observation probabilities. More
specifically, we prove that the angle between the estimated and oracle
projection directions, as well as the changepoint location error, are
controlled with high probability by the sum of two terms, both involving this
weighted sum of squares, and representing the error incurred due to noise and
the error due to missingness respectively. A lower bound confirms that our
changepoint estimator, which we call 'MissInspect', is optimal up to a
logarithmic factor. The striking effectiveness of the MissInspect methodology
is further demonstrated both on simulated data, and on an oceanographic data
set covering the Neogene period.

with pump modulation in the threshold region with a large amplitude and
different values of modulation frequency. Modulation around threshold
necessarily includes ``below-threshold'' dynamics, which can be effectively
displayed only through through a nonlinear visualization of the oscillations.
The irregular temporal behaviour is examined at various modulation frequencies
and amplitudes, highlighting a possible route to chaos for very large amplitude
modulation in the near-threshold region. The addition of the (average)
spontaneous emission to the lasing mode enables a coupled dynamics between
photons and carriers even below threshold, thus extending the pump range in
which the modulation actively modifies the laser behaviour. We also report on
the existence of a transition between similar attractors characterized by a
temporal transient which depends on the amplitude of the modulation driving the
pump.

gripper configuration is defined as a pair of fingertips. An effective CNN
architecture is introduced to localize such fingertips, and with the help of
auxiliary centers for refinement, it accurately and robustly infers grasp
candidates. Additionally, we design a specialized loss function to measure the
quality of grasps, and in contrast to the IoU scores of bounding boxes adopted
in object detection, it is more consistent to the grasp detection task. Both
the simulation and robotic experiments are executed and state of the art

their geological associations, provide important information about surface
processes. We analyzed all available images of the surface of Mercury that have
sufficient resolution and quality to detect boulders, and we mapped all the
boulders observed. The lower size limit of detectable boulders was ~5 m. All
boulders found on Mercury are associated with fresh impact craters hundreds of
meters in diameter or larger. We compared boulder population on Mercury with
population of boulders of the same size on the Moon, and found that boulders on
Mercury are ~30 times less abundant than in the lunar highlands. This exact
quantitative estimate is inherently inaccurate due to the limitation in the
source data; however, the significant relative rarity of boulders on Mercury
can be firmly and reliably established. We discuss possible causes of the
observed difference. Higher thermal stresses and more rapid material fatigue
due to diurnal temperature cycling on Mercury may cause rapid disintegration of
the upper decimeters of the boulder surface and thus contribute to more rapid
boulder obliteration; however, these factors alone cannot account for the
observed difference. A proposed thicker regolith on Mercury is likely to
significantly reduce boulder production rate. A higher micrometeoritic flux on
Mercury is likely to result in micrometeoritic abrasion being a dominant
contributor to boulder degradation; this high abrasion rate likely shortens the
boulder lifetime. A combination of these factors appears to be able to account
for the relative rarity of boulders on Mercury.

duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However,
these two modules have been treated as two stand-alone components, which makes
it difficult to achieve a global system optimality. In this paper, we propose a
deep learning-based approach that directly optimizes the beamformers at the
base station according to the received uplink pilots, thereby, bypassing the
explicit channel estimation. Different from the existing fully data-driven
approach where all the modules are replaced by deep neural networks (DNNs), a
neural calibration method is proposed to improve the scalability of the
end-to-end design. In particular, the backbone of conventional time-efficient
algorithms, i.e., the least-squares (LS) channel estimator and the zero-forcing
(ZF) beamformer, is preserved and DNNs are leveraged to calibrate their inputs
for better performance. The permutation equivariance property of the formulated
resource allocation problem is then identified to design a low-complexity
neural network architecture. Simulation results will show the superiority of
the proposed neural calibration method over benchmark schemes in terms of both
the spectral efficiency and scalability in large-scale wireless networks.

any surface or other object. We explore the energetics of such a particle
moving uniformly in vacuum, continuing our previous investigations of quantum
friction. The intrinsic polarizability of the particle is considered to be
purely real before it is dressed by radiation. The particle is then guaranteed
to be in the nonequilibrium steady state (NESS), where it absorbs and emits
energy at the same rate. We first calculate the quantum frictional power and
force on the particle in the rest frame of the blackbody radiation from first
principles, namely the Maxwell-Heaviside equations and the Lorentz force law.
Then we provide a simpler method of obtaining the same quantities in the rest
frame of the particle by using the principle of virtual work. The equivalence
of the two approaches is illustrated. The formulas we derive for quantum vacuum
frictional power and force are fully relativistic and applicable to finite
temperature. In NESS, the quantum vacuum frictional force on the particle is
shown to be a true drag, independent of the model for polarizability and the
polarization state of the particle. Finally, we give an estimate of the quantum

axisymmetric simulations of the COS using the code SNOOPY, showing first how
parasites halt the instability's exponential growth, and second, the different
saturation routes it takes subsequently. As the Reynolds and (pseudo-)
Richardson numbers increase, the system moves successively from (a) a weakly
nonlinear state characterised by relatively ordered nonlinear waves, to (b)
wave turbulence, and finally to (c) the formation of intermittent and then
persistent zonal flows. In three-dimensions, we expect the latter flows to
spawn vortices in the orbital plane. Given the very high Reynolds numbers in
protoplanetary discs, the third regime should be the most prevalent. As a
consequence, we argue that the COS is an important dynamical process in planet

surface in $j=3/2$ superconductors with strong spin-orbit coupling and equally
curved bands in the normal state. In contrast to conventional pairing between
spin-$1/2$ electrons, we derive that pairing can happen between inter-band
electrons having different magnetic quantum numbers, for instance, $m_j=1/2$
and $m_j=3/2$. Such superconducting correlations manifest themselves by a pair
of indirect gap-like structures at finite excitation energies. An observable
signature of this exotic pairing is the emergence of a pair of symmetric
superconducting coherence peaks in the density of states at finite energies.
Moreover, the angular-momentum-resolved density of states in the presence of a
perturbative Zeeman field reflects the $m_j$ composition of the Cooper pairs.
We argue that such finite-energy pairing is a generic feature of $j=3/2$
superconductors, both in presence and absence of inversion symmetry.

  Furthermore, when the base is a projective space we show that two quadratic
forms are hyperbolic equivalent if and only if their cokernel sheaves are
isomorphic up to twist, their fibers over a fixed point of the base are Witt
equivalent, and, in some cases, certain quadratic forms on intermediate

computational advantages and connection to biology. But how the level of
sparsity contributes to performance on visual tasks is not well understood. In
this work, sparse coding has been integrated into an existing hierarchical V2
model (Hosoya and Hyv\""arinen, 2015), but replacing its independent component
analysis (ICA) with an explicit sparse coding in which the degree of sparsity
can be controlled. After training, the sparse coding basis functions with a
higher degree of sparsity resembled qualitatively different structures, such as
curves and corners. The contributions of the models were assessed with image
classification tasks, specifically tasks associated with mid-level vision
including figure-ground classification, texture classification, and angle
prediction between two line stimuli. In addition, the models were assessed in
comparison to a texture sensitivity measure that has been reported in V2
(Freeman et al., 2013), and a deleted-region inference task. The results from
the experiments show that while sparse coding performed worse than ICA at
classifying images, only sparse coding was able to better match the texture
sensitivity level of V2 and infer deleted image regions, both by increasing the
degree of sparsity in sparse coding. Higher degrees of sparsity allowed for
inference over larger deleted image regions. The mechanism that allows for this
inference capability in sparse coding is described here.

light emission is the semiconductor bandgap divided by the elementary charge.
Here we show for many classes of LEDs, including those based on metal halide
perovskite, organic, chalcogenide quantum-dot and commercial III-V

with very different modes of charge injection and recombination (dark
saturation current densities ranging from ~10^-35 to ~10^-21 mA/cm2), their EL
intensity-voltage curves under low voltages exhibit similar behaviors,
revealing a universal origin of ultralow-voltage device operation. Finally, we

further (nonlocal) commuting flows to the standard KdV hierarchy. The second

metasurfaces. In this work, empowered by deep learning algorithms, the complex
gathering coupling can be learned efficiently from the preset dataset so that
the functionalities of nonlocal metasurfaces can be significantly uncovered. As
an example, we demonstrate that nonlocal metasurfaces, which can redirect an
incident wave into multi-channel reflections with arbitrary energy ratios, can
be accurately predicted by deep learning algorithms. Compared to the theory,
the relative error of the energy ratios is less than 1\%. Furthermore,
experiments witness three-channel reflection with three types of energy ratios
of (1, 0, 0), (1/2, 0, 1/2), and (1/3, 1/3, 1/3), proving the validity of the
deep learning enabled nonlocal metasurfaces. Our work might blaze a new trail
in the design of acoustic functional devices, especially for the cases
containing complex wave-matter interactions.

biometric approach to establish the identity of individuals. However, matching
iris images acquired at different spectral bands (i.e., matching a visible
(VIS) iris probe to a gallery of near-infrared (NIR) iris images or vice versa)
shows a significant performance degradation when compared to intraband NIR
matching. Hence, in this paper, we have investigated a range of deep
convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) architectures to further
improve the accuracy of cross-spectral iris recognition methods. Moreover,
unlike the existing works in the literature, we introduce a resolution
difference into the classical cross-spectral matching problem domain. We have
developed two different techniques using the conditional generative adversarial
network (cGAN) as a backbone architecture for cross-spectral iris matching. In
the first approach, we simultaneously address the cross-resolution and
cross-spectral matching problem by training a cGAN that jointly translates
cross-resolution as well as cross-spectral tasks to the same resolution and
within the same spectrum. In the second approach, we design a coupled
generative adversarial network (cpGAN) architecture consisting of a pair of
cGAN modules that project the VIS and NIR iris images into a low-dimensional
embedding domain to ensure maximum pairwise similarity between the feature
vectors from the two iris modalities of the same subject.

At variance with time-series-based approaches, our goal is to learn a

either from classical 1/f{\alpha} noise or from the interaction with a bath of
quantum oscillators. The parameters to be classified are the color {\alpha} of
the classical noise or the Ohmicity parameter s of the quantum environment. In
both cases, we found that NNs are able to exactly classify parameters into 16
classes using noiseless data (a linear NN is enough for the color, whereas a
single-layer NN is needed for the Ohmicity). In the presence of noisy data
(e.g. coming from noisy tomographic measurements), the network is able to
classify the color of the 1/f{\alpha} noise into 16 classes with about 70%
accuracy, whereas classification of Ohmicity turns out to be challenging. We
also consider a more coarse-grained task, and train the network to discriminate

preserving clothing details ( e.g., texture, logos, patterns ) when
transferring desired clothes onto a target person under a fixed pose. However,
the performances of existing methods significantly dropped when extending
existing methods to multi-pose virtual try-on. In this paper, we propose an
end-to-end Semantic Prediction Guidance multi-pose Virtual Try-On Network
(SPG-VTON), which could fit the desired clothing into a reference person under
arbitrary poses. Concretely, SPG-VTON is composed of three sub-modules. First,
a Semantic Prediction Module (SPM) generates the desired semantic map. The
predicted semantic map provides more abundant guidance to locate the desired
clothes region and produce a coarse try-on image. Second, a Clothes Warping
Module (CWM) warps in-shop clothes to the desired shape according to the
predicted semantic map and the desired pose. Specifically, we introduce a
conductible cycle consistency loss to alleviate the misalignment in the clothes
warping process. Third, a Try-on Synthesis Module (TSM) combines the coarse
result and the warped clothes to generate the final virtual try-on image,
preserving details of the desired clothes and under the desired pose. Besides,
we introduce a face identity loss to refine the facial appearance and maintain
the identity of the final virtual try-on result at the same time. We evaluate
the proposed method on the most massive multi-pose dataset (MPV) and the
DeepFashion dataset. The qualitative and quantitative experiments show that
SPG-VTON is superior to the state-of-the-art methods and is robust to the data

ExBERT takes full advantage of contextual word representations obtained from

becomes clear that multiple AI paradigms (such as neural networks, machine

applied to improve the process and eliminate many of the major challenges that
the SE field has been facing. This survey chapter is a review of the most
commonplace methods of AI applied to SE. The review covers methods between

found, 19 for design, 15 for development, 68 for testing, and 15 for release

firstly, to answer the following questions: is there sufficient intelligence in
the SE lifecycle? What does applying AI to SE entail? Secondly, to measure,
formulize, and evaluate the overlap of SE phases and AI disciplines. Lastly,
this chapter aims to provide serious questions to challenging the current

Stieltjes transform of functions with logarithmic growths at the origin, the
relationship is established between the analytic continuation of the Mellin

Mellin integral is extended beyond its strip of analyticity. It is settled that
the analytic continuation and the finite-part integral coincide at the regular
points of the analytic continuation. To establish the connection between the
two at the isolated singularities of the analytic continuation, the concept of
regularized limit is introduced to replace the usual concept of limit due to
Cauchy when the later leads to a division by zero. It is then shown that the
regularized limit of the analytic continuation at its isolated singularities
equals the finite-part integrals at the singularities themselves. The treatment
gives the exact evaluation of the Stieltjes transform in terms of finite-part
integrals and yields the dominant asymptotic behavior of the transform for
arbitrarily small values of the parameter in the presence of arbitrary
logarithmic singularities at the origin.

Here, we introduce a hybrid continuum-discrete approach, built on the coupled

impact dynamics with unparalleled efficiency. To accommodate highly complex
solid-granular interactions, we enhance the existing MP-DEM formulation with
three new ingredients: (i) a robust contact algorithm that couples the
continuum and discrete parts without any interpenetration under extreme impact
loads, (ii) large deformation kinematics employing multiplicative
elastoplasticity, and (iii) a trans-phase constitutive relation capturing
gasification of granular media. For validation, we also generate experimental
data through laboratory measurement of the impact dynamics of solid spheres
dropped onto dry sand. Simulation of the experiments shows that the proposed
approach can well reproduce granular impact dynamics in terms of impact forces,
intrusion depths, and splash patterns. Further, through parameter studies on
material properties, model formulations, and numerical schemes, we identify key
factors for successful continuum-discrete simulation of granular impact
dynamics.

symmetry breaking effects where, a linear electric and constant magnetic field
is considered and analyze its effects on the relativistic quantum oscillator.
Furthermore, the behavior of the quantum oscillator in the presence of a
Cornell-type scalar potential is analyzed and the solution of the bound state
is obtained. We see that the analytical solution to the generalized
Klein-Gordon oscillator can be achieved and the angular frequency of the
oscillator depends on the quantum numbers of the system

  across Great Britain","46 pages, 16 figures, 4 tables",,,,"cs.CY stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Aim: This research proposes the first solely sociodemographic measure of
digital accessibility for Great Britain. Digital inaccessibility affects circa
10 million people who are unable to access or make full use of the internet,
particularly impacting the disadvantaged in society. Method: A geodemographic
classification is developed, analysing literature-guided sociodemographic
variables at the district level. Analysis: Resultant clusters are analysed
against their sociodemographic variables and spatial extent. Findings suggest
three at-risk clusters exist, ""Metropolitan Minority Struggle"", ""Indian
Metropolitan Living"" and ""Pakistani-Bangladeshi Inequality"". These are
validated through nationwide Ofcom telecommunications performance data and
specific case studies using Office for National Statistics internet usage data.
Conclusion: Using solely contemporary and open-source sociodemographic
variables, this paper enhances previous digital accessibility research. The
identification of digitally inaccessible areas allows focussed local and
national government resource and policy targeting, particularly important as a
key data source and methodology post-2021, following the expected final
nationwide census.

  Millimeter Wave Networks",,,,,"cs.NI cs.AI cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a novel framework is proposed for channel charting (CC)-aided
localization in millimeter wave networks. In particular, a convolutional
autoencoder model is proposed to estimate the three-dimensional location of
wireless user equipment (UE), based on multipath channel state information
(CSI), received by different base stations. In order to learn the
radio-geometry map and capture the relative position of each UE, an
autoencoder-based channel chart is constructed in an unsupervised manner, such
that neighboring UEs in the physical space will remain close in the channel
chart. Next, the channel charting model is extended to a semi-supervised
framework, where the autoencoder is divided into two components: an encoder and
a decoder, and each component is optimized individually, using the labeled CSI
dataset with associated location information, to further improve positioning
accuracy. Simulation results show that the proposed CC-aided semi-supervised
localization yields a higher accuracy, compared with existing supervised
positioning and conventional unsupervised CC approaches.

  Surrogate Modelling","Submitted to CDCEO 2021 (1st Workshop on Complex Data Challenges in
  Earth Observation)",,,,"physics.ao-ph cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurately modelling the Earth's climate has widespread applications ranging
from forecasting local weather to understanding global climate change.
Low-fidelity simulations of climate phenomena are readily available, but
high-fidelity simulations are expensive to obtain. We therefore investigate the
potential of Gaussian process-based multi-fidelity surrogate modelling as a way
to produce high-fidelity climate predictions at low cost. Specifically, our
model combines the predictions of a low-fidelity Global Climate Model (GCM) and
those of a high-fidelity Regional Climate Model (RCM) to produce high-fidelity
temperature predictions for a mountainous region on the coastline of Peru. We
are able to produce high-fidelity temperature predictions at significantly
lower computational cost compared to the high-fidelity model alone: our
predictions have an average error of $15.62^\circ\text{C}^2$ yet our approach
only evaluates the high-fidelity model on 6% of the region of interest.

  organic contaminants","28 pages, 4 figures and Supplementary Material","Water Research, 2021, 117492","10.1016/j.watres.2021.117492",,"physics.chem-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Graphene-based sponges doped with atomic nitrogen and boron were applied for
the electrochemical degradation of persistent organic contaminants in one-pass,
flow-through mode, and in a low-conductivity supporting electrolyte. The
B-doped anode and N-doped cathode was capable of >90% contaminant removal at
the geometric anodic current density of 173 A m2. The electrochemical
degradation of contaminants was achieved via the direct electron transfer, the
anodically formed O3, and by the OH radicals formed by the decomposition of
H2O2 produced at the cathode. The identified transformation products of
iopromide show that the anodic cleavage of all three C-I bonds at the aromatic
ring was preferential over scissions at the alkyl side chains, suggesting a
determining role of the pi-pi interactions with the graphene surface. In the
presence of 20 mM sodium chloride (NaCl), the current efficiency for chlorine
production was <0.04%, and there was no chlorate and perchlorate formation,
demonstrating a very low electrocatalytic activity of the graphene-based sponge
anode towards chloride. Graphene-based sponges were produced using a low-cost,
bottom-up method that allows easy introduction of dopants and functionalization
of the reduced graphene oxide coating, and thus tailoring of the material for
the removal of specific contaminants.
