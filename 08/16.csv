registration algorithms plays a critical role in the deployment of image
registration algorithms for clinical applications such as surgical planning,
intraoperative guidance, and longitudinal monitoring of disease progression or
treatment efficacy as well as in research-oriented processing pipelines.
Currently available approaches for uncertainty estimation in DNN-based image
registration algorithms may result in sub-optimal clinical decision making due
to potentially inaccurate estimation of the uncertainty of the registration
stems for the assumed parametric distribution of the registration latent space.
We introduce NPBDREG, a fully non-parametric Bayesian framework for uncertainty
estimation in DNN-based deformable image registration by combining an Adam
optimizer with stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) to characterize the
underlying posterior distribution through posterior sampling. Thus, it has the
potential to provide uncertainty estimates that are highly correlated with the
presence of out of distribution data. We demonstrated the added-value of
NPBDREG, compared to the baseline probabilistic VoxelMorph model (PrVXM), on
brain MRI image registration using $390$ image pairs from four publicly
available databases: MGH10, CMUC12, ISBR18 and LPBA40. The NPBDREG shows a
better correlation of the predicted uncertainty with out-of-distribution data
($r>0.95$ vs. $r<0.5$) as well as a 7.3%improvement in the registration
accuracy (Dice score, $0.74$ vs. $0.69$, $p \ll 0.01$), and 18% improvement in
registration smoothness (percentage of folds in the deformation field, 0.014
vs. 0.017, $p \ll 0.01$). Finally, NPBDREG demonstrated a better generalization
capability for data corrupted by a mixed structure noise (Dice score of $0.73$
vs. $0.69$, $p \ll 0.01$) compared to the baseline PrVXM approach.

based on deep neural networks have been proposed for the pixel-level
segmentation of tumors in brain MRIs. However, the structural variations,
spatial dissimilarities, and intensity inhomogeneity in MRIs make segmentation
a challenging task. We propose a new end-to-end brain tumor segmentation
architecture based on U-Net that integrates Inception modules and dilated
convolutions into its contracting and expanding paths. This allows us to
extract local structural as well as global contextual information. We performed
segmentation of glioma sub-regions, including tumor core, enhancing tumor, and
whole tumor using Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2018 dataset. Our proposed
model performed significantly better than the state-of-the-art U-Net-based
model ($p<0.05$) for tumor core and whole tumor segmentation.

Rose, and Speer (1988). This problem turns out to be critical, exhibiting the
following phase transition. In the weakly nonlinear regime, we prove
normalizability of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure and show that it is singular with
respect to the massive Gaussian free field. Moreover, we show that there exists
a shifted measure with respect to which the $\Phi^3_3$-measure is absolutely

a particular challenge as compared to our previous works. In order to overcome

we prove that the truncated $\Phi^3_3$-measures have no weak limit in a natural

discretely sampled Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, which interpolates between these
two limits. We show that in the limit of large times, its extreme values
converge to those of the equilibrium distribution, instead of those of the
continuously sampled process. This finding folds for any positive sampling
interval, with an abrupt transition at zero. We then analyze the Langevin
equation for any force that gives rise to a stable equilibrium distribution.
For forces which asymptotically grow with the distance from the equilibrium
point, the above conclusion continues to hold, and the extreme values for large

joint beamforming control and power allocation in ad-hoc mmWave networks. Over
the shared spectrum, a number of multi-input-multi-output links attempt to
minimize their supply power by simultaneously finding the locally optimal power
allocation and beamformers in a self-organized manner. Our design considers a
family of non-convex quality-of-service constraint and utility functions
characterized by monotonicity in the strategies of the various users. We
propose a two-stage, decentralized optimization scheme, where the adaptation of
power levels and beamformer coefficients are iteratively performed by each
link. We first prove that given a set of receive beamformers, the power
allocation stage converges to an optimal generalized Nash equilibrium of the
generalized power allocation game. Then we prove that iterative
minimum-mean-square-error adaptation of the receive beamformer results in an
overall converging scheme. Several transmit beamforming schemes requiring
different levels of information exchange are also compared in the proposed
allocation framework. Our simulation results show that allowing each link to
optimize its transmit filters using the direct channel results in a near
optimum performance with very low computational complexity, even though the

problem that is lacking a universal solution. One of the computationally
efficient ways to solve it is to build a geometric path first and then
transform this path into a kinematically feasible one. Gradient-informed Path
Smoothing (GRIPS) is a recently introduced method for such transformation.
GRIPS iteratively deforms the path and adds/deletes the waypoints while trying
to connect each consecutive pair of them via the provided steering function
that respects the kinematic constraints. The algorithm is relatively fast but,
unfortunately, does not provide any guarantees that it will succeed. In
practice, it often fails to produce feasible trajectories for car-like robots
with large turning radius. In this work, we introduce a range of modifications
that are aimed at increasing the success rate of GRIPS for car-like robots. The
main enhancement is adding the additional step that heuristically samples
waypoints along the bottleneck parts of the geometric paths (such as sharp
turns). The results of the experimental evaluation provide a clear evidence
that the success rate of the suggested algorithm is up to 40% higher compared
to the original GRIPS and hits the bar of 90%, while its runtime is lower.

haloes is key to mitigating systematic uncertainties in next-generation cluster
cosmology. We develop a novel method to infer the level of conformity between
the stellar mass of the brightest central galaxies~(BCGs) $M_*^{BCG}$ and the
satellite richness $\lambda$, defined as their correlation coefficient
$\rho_{cc}$ at fixed halo mass, using the abundance and weak lensing of SDSS
clusters as functions of $M_*^{BCG}$ and $\lambda$. We detect a halo
mass-dependent conformity as
$\rho_{cc}{=}0.60{+}0.08\ln(M_h/3{\times}10^{14}M_{\odot}/h)$. The strong
conformity successfully resolves the ""halo mass equality"" conundrum discovered
in Zu et al. 2021 -- when split by $M_*^{BCG}$ at fixed $\lambda$, the low and
high-$M_*^{BCG}$ clusters have the same average halo mass despite having a
$0.34$ dex discrepancy in average $M_*^{BCG}$. On top of the best-fitting
conformity model, we develop a cluster assembly bias~(AB) prescription
calibrated against the CosmicGrowth simulation, and build a conformity+AB model
for the cluster weak lensing measurements. Our model predicts that with a
${\sim}20\%$ lower halo concentration $c$, the low-$M_*^{BCG}$ clusters are
${\sim}10\%$ more biased than the high-$M_*^{BCG}$ systems, in excellent
agreement with the observations. We also show that the observed conformity and
assembly bias are unlikely due to projection effects. Finally, we build a toy
model to argue that while the early-time BCG-halo co-evolution drives the
$M_*^{BCG}$-$c$ correlation, the late-time dry merger-induced BCG growth
naturally produces the $M_*^{BCG}$-$\lambda$ conformity despite the well-known
anti-correlation between $\lambda$ and $c$. Our method paves the path towards

current densities has been explored. The non-equilibrium momentum distribution
of degrees of freedom has been obtained in the presence of space-time varying

It is observed that the electric charge transport is sensitive to the

photoemission spectroscopy, we provide a layer- and momentum-resolved view on
ultrafast interlayer electron and energy transfer in a
monolayer-WSe$_2$/graphene heterostructure. Depending on the nature of the
optically prepared state, we find the different dominating transfer mechanisms:
while electron injection from graphene to WSe$_2$ is observed after
photoexcitation of quasi-free hot carriers in the graphene layer, we establish
an interfacial Meitner-Auger energy transfer process following the excitation
of excitons in WSe$_2$. By analysing the time-energy-momentum distributions of
excited-state carriers with a rate-equation model, we distinguish these two
types of interfacial dynamics and identify the ultrafast conversion of excitons
in WSe$_2$ to valence band transitions in graphene. Microscopic calculations
find interfacial dipole-monopole coupling underlying the Meitner-Auger energy
transfer to dominate over conventional F\""orster- and Dexter-type interactions,
in agreement with the experimental observations. The energy transfer mechanism
revealed here might enable new hot-carrier-based device concepts with van der

techniques such as carbon nanotube (CNT) coating opens the way to novel
molecular transport strategies for biosensing purposes. In this article, we
predict a macromolecular transport mechanism enabling the dielectric
manipulation of the polymer translocation dynamics in dielectric membrane pores
confining mixed electrolytes. In the giant permittivity regime of these
engineered membranes governed by attractive polarization forces, multivalent
ions adsorbed by the membrane nanopore trigger a monovalent ion separation and
set an electroosmotic counterion flow. The drag force exerted by this flow is
sufficiently strong to suppress and invert the electrophoretic velocity of
anionic polymers, and also to generate the mobility of neutral polymers whose
speed and direction can be solely adjusted by the charge and concentration of
the added multivalent ions. These features identify the dielectrically
generated transport mechanism as an efficient mean to drive overall neutral or
weakly charged analytes that cannot be controlled by an external voltage. We
also reveal that in anionic polymer translocation, multivalent cation addition
into the monovalent salt solution amplifies the electric current signal by
several factors. The signal amplification is caused by the electrostatic
many-body interactions replacing the monovalent polymer counterions by the
multivalent cations of higher electric mobility. The strength of this
elektrokinetic charge discrimination points out the potential of multivalent
ions as current amplifiers capable of providing boosted resolution in
nanopore-based biosensing techniques.

anomalous temporal segments (i.e., consecutive time points) in an input

so that it infers the sequential order of normal and anomalous segments within
each instance, which can be used as a rough segmentation mask. Based on the
dynamic time warping (DTW) alignment between the input instance and its
segmentation mask, WETAS obtains the result of temporal segmentation, and
simultaneously, it further enhances itself by using the mask as additional
supervision. Our experiments show that WETAS considerably outperforms other
baselines in terms of the localization of temporal anomalies, and also it
provides more informative results than point-level detection methods.

servers to end users causes increased stress on both the fronthaul and backhaul

closer to the end-users has emerged as an effective method for reducing network
congestion and improving user experience. To find the optimal locations for
content caching, many conventional approaches construct various mixed integer
linear programming (MILP) models. However, such methods may fail to support
online decision making due to the inherent curse of dimensionality. In this
paper, a novel framework for proactive caching is proposed. This framework
merges model-based optimization with data-driven techniques by transforming an
optimization problem into a grayscale image. For parallel training and simple
design purposes, the proposed MILP model is first decomposed into a number of
sub-problems and, then, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained to
predict content caching locations of these sub-problems. Furthermore, since the
MILP model decomposition neglects the internal effects among sub-problems, the
CNNs' outputs have the risk to be infeasible solutions. Therefore, two
algorithms are provided: the first uses predictions from CNNs as an extra
constraint to reduce the number of decision variables; the second employs CNNs'
outputs to accelerate local search. Numerical results show that the proposed
scheme can reduce 71.6% computation time with only 0.8% additional performance
cost compared to the MILP solution, which provides high quality decision making

conclusions from observational data. Two complementary types of approaches have
been developed to address this obstacle. An extensive line of work is based on
taking advantage of fortuitous external aids (such as the presence of an
instrumental variable or other proxy), along with additional assumptions to
ensure identification. A recent line of work of proximal causal inference (Miao
et al., 2018a) has aimed to provide a novel approach to using proxies to deal
with unobserved confounding without relying on stringent parametric
assumptions. On the other hand, a complete characterization of identifiability
of a large class of causal parameters in arbitrary causal models with hidden
variables has been developed using the language of graphical models, resulting
in the ID algorithm and related extensions (Tian and Pearl, 2002; Shpitser and
Pearl, 2006a,b). Celebrated special cases of this approach, such as the
front-door model, are able to obtain non-parametric identification in seemingly
counter-intuitive situations when a treatment and an outcome share an
arbitrarily complicated unobserved common cause.
  In this paper we aim to develop a synthesis of the proximal and graphical
approaches to identification in causal inference to yield the most general
identification algorithm in multi- variate systems currently known - the
proximal ID algorithm. In addition to being able to obtain non-parametric
identification in all cases where the ID algorithm succeeds, our approach
allows us to systematically exploit proxies to adjust for the presence of
unobserved confounders that would have otherwise prevented identification.
  In addition, we outline a class of estimation strategies for causal
parameters identified by our method in an important special case. We
illustration our approach by simulation studies.

with both increased levels of transmissibility and virulence with respect to
the original wild variant. The Delta (B.1.617.2) variation, first seen in
India, dominates COVID-19 infections in several large countries including the
United States and India. Most recently, the Lambda variant of interest with
increased resistance to vaccines has spread through much of South America.
Objective: This research explores the degree to which new variants of concern
1) generate spikes and waves of fluctuations in the daily case fatality rates
(CFR) across countries in several regions in the face of increasing levels of
vaccination of national populations and 2) may increase the vulnerability of
persons with certain comorbidities. Methods: This study uses new, openly
available, epidemiological statistics reported to the relevant national and
international authorities for countries across the Americas, Europe, Africa,
Asia and the Middle East. Daily CFRs and correlations of fatal COVID-19
infections with potential cofactors are computed for the first half of 2021

a country to-country basis in the same region. It also finds minimal variation
of correlation between the cofactors based on WHO data and on the average

of devices for users with these disabilities by creating a simple, inexpensive,
and portable way to enable high accuracy touch interaction with large surfaces
such as a table or even a wall.
  This project uses a novel approach that analyzes the acoustic signals at four
piezoelectric microphones placed on the interactive surface to identify sounds
related to the same event (e.g., a finger tap) at each of the microphones. ALTo
(Acoustic Localized Touch) uses the results of this signal processing to
compute the time difference of arrival (TDOA) across the microphones. The
collected TDOA data is used to compute an approximate location of a sound
source (e.g., a finger tap) using a collection of hyperbolic equations.
  An experimental evaluation of a system prototype was used to identify a
number of software and signal processing optimizations needed to significantly
improve accuracy and create a usable system. The results of the research
indicate that it is possible to detect the location of a touch with high
accuracy. The ALTo prototype achieves an accuracy of 1.45cm in the x-direction
and 2.72cm the y-direction which is within the range for the target usage

Recognition (HAR), applications could track if a patient took his pills and
detect the behavioral changes associated with diseases such as Alzheimer's.
Current systems for HAR require diverse sensors (e.g., cameras, microphones,
proximity sensors, and accelerometers) placed throughout the environment to
provide detailed observations needed for high-accuracy HAR. The difficulty of
instrumenting an environment with these sensors makes this approach
impractical.
  This project considers whether recent advances in indoor localization (Wi-Fi
Round Trip Time) enable high-accuracy HAR using only a smartphone. My design,
called Location-Enhanced HAR (LEHAR), uses machine learning to combine
acceleration, audio, and location data to detect common human activities. A
LEHAR prototype, designed to recognize a dozen common activities conducted in a
typical household, achieved an F1-score of 0.965. In contrast, existing
approaches, which use only acceleration or audio data, obtained F1-scores of
0.660 and 0.865, respectively, on the same activities. In addition, the
F1-score of existing designs dropped significantly as more activities were
added for recognition, while LEHAR was able to maintain high accuracy. The
results show that using a combination of acceleration, audio, and Wi-Fi Round
Trip Time localization can enable a highly accurate and easily deployable HAR
system.

linear precoding strategy that maximizes the sum spectral efficiency of RSMA is
a challenging yet significant problem. In this paper, we put forth a novel
precoder design framework that jointly finds the linear precoders for the

non-smooth minimum function part in the sum spectral efficiency of RSMA using a
LogSumExp technique. Then, we reformulate the sum spectral efficiency
maximization problem as a form of the log-sum of Rayleigh quotients to convert
it into a tractable form. By interpreting the first-order optimality condition
of the reformulated problem as an eigenvector-dependent nonlinear eigenvalue
problem, we reveal that the leading eigenvector of the derived optimality
condition is a local optimal solution. To find the leading eigenvector, we
propose an algorithm inspired by a power iteration. Simulation results show
that the proposed RSMA transmission strategy provides significant improvement
in the sum spectral efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art RSMA
transmission methods.

perceptual image quality in accordance with subjective evaluations, it is a
complex and unsolved problem due to the absence of the pristine reference
image. In this paper, we propose a novel model to address the NR-IQA task by
leveraging a hybrid approach that benefits from Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and self-attention mechanism in Transformers to extract both local and
non-local features from the input image. We capture local structure information
of the image via CNNs, then to circumvent the locality bias among the extracted
CNNs features and obtain a non-local representation of the image, we utilize
Transformers on the extracted features where we model them as a sequential
input to the Transformer model. Furthermore, to improve the monotonicity
correlation between the subjective and objective scores, we utilize the
relative distance information among the images within each batch and enforce
the relative ranking among them. Last but not least, we observe that the
performance of NR-IQA models degrades when we apply equivariant transformations
(e.g. horizontal flipping) to the inputs. Therefore, we propose a method that
leverages self-consistency as a source of self-supervision to improve the
robustness of NRIQA models. Specifically, we enforce self-consistency between
the outputs of our quality assessment model for each image and its
transformation (horizontally flipped) to utilize the rich self-supervisory
information and reduce the uncertainty of the model. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of our work, we evaluate it on seven standard IQA datasets (both
synthetic and authentic) and show that our model achieves state-of-the-art

state and input variables always have homogeneous units despite the generalized
coordinates may involve in both translational and rotational components and the
constraint wrench may involve in both force and moment components. Therefore,
this formulation is inherently invariant with respect to changes in dimensional
units without requiring weighting matrices. Moreover, in this formulation the
equations of motion are completely decoupled from those of constrained force.
This allows the possibility of a simple force control action that is totally
independent of the motion control action facilitating a hybrid force/motion

training a model over heterogeneous data distributed across many clients. A
common approach is local methods, where clients take multiple optimization
steps over local data before communicating with the server (e.g., FedAvg).
Local methods can exploit similarity between clients' data. However, in
existing analyses, this comes at the cost of slow convergence in terms of the
dependence on the number of communication rounds R. On the other hand, global
methods, where clients simply return a gradient vector in each round (e.g.,
SGD), converge faster in terms of R but fail to exploit the similarity between
clients even when clients are homogeneous. We propose FedChain, an algorithmic
framework that combines the strengths of local methods and global methods to
achieve fast convergence in terms of R while leveraging the similarity between
clients. Using FedChain, we instantiate algorithms that improve upon previously
known rates in the general convex and PL settings, and are near-optimal (via an
algorithm-independent lower bound that we show) for problems that satisfy
strong convexity. Empirical results support this theoretical gain over existing

high-dimensional data analysis, but it requires to express data by a matrix
with observations to be continuous. To overcome the limitations, a new method
called flexible PCA (FPCA) for exponential family distributions is proposed.
The goal is to ensure that it can be implemented to arbitrary shaped region for
either count or continuous observations. The methodology of FPCA is developed
under the framework of generalized linear models. It provides statistical
models for FPCA not limited to matrix expressions of the data. A maximum
likelihood approach is proposed to derive the decomposition when the number of
principal components (PCs) is known. This naturally induces a penalized
likelihood approach to determine the number of PCs when it is unknown. By
modifying it for missing data problems, the proposed method is compared with
previous PCA methods for missing data. The simulation study shows that the
performance of FPCA is always better than its competitors. The application uses
the proposed method to reduce the dimensionality of arbitrary shaped
sub-regions of images and the global spread patterns of COVID-19 under normal
and Poisson distributions, respectively.

the movements of quasiparticles. Here we show that these quasiparticles can be
hierarchical. Examples are valley electrons, which move in hyperorbits within a
honeycomb lattice and forms a valley pseudospin, or the self-rotation of the
wave-packet. We demonstrate that twist can induce higher level motions of
valley electrons around the moire superlattice of bilayer systems. Such larger
scale collective movement of the valley electron, can be regarded as the
self-rotation (spin) of a higher-level quasiparticle, or what we call
super-valley electron. This quasiparticle, in principle, may have mesoscopic
size as the moire supercell can be very large. It could result in fascinating
properties like topological and chiral transport, superfluid, etc., even though
these properties are absent in the pristine untwisted system. Using twisted
antiferromagnetically coupled bilayer with honeycomb lattice as example, we
find that there forms a Haldane-like superlattice with periodically staggered
magnetic flux and the system could demonstrate quantum super-valley Hall
effect. Further analyses reveal that the super-valley electron possesses
opposite chirality when projected onto the top and bottom layer, and can be
described as two components (magnetic monopoles) of Dirac fermion entangled in
real-space, or a giant electron. Our theory opens a new way to understand the
collective motions of electrons in solid.

experiments. The propagation of electromagnetic waves is described by Maxwell
equations with an appropriate description of the plasma as a dielectric medium.
Before advancing to the tensor dielectric of a magnetized plasma, this paper
considers wave propagation in a one-dimensional inhomogeneous scalar
dielectric.
  The classic theory of scattering of plane electromagnetic waves at a planar
interface, separating two different dielectric media, leads to Fresnel
equations for reflection and transmission coefficients. In contrast to plane
waves, this paper is on the reflection and transmission of a spatially confined
electromagnetic pulse. An analytical formulation for the scattering of a
Gaussian pulse shows that the maximum transmission coefficient is modified by
the square-root of the ratio of the two permittivities. The theory is
complemented by numerical simulations using a quantum lattice algorithm for
Maxwell equations. The algorithm, based on the Riemann-Silberstein-Weber
representation of the electromagnetic fields and expressed in term of qubits,
is an interleaved sequence of entangling operators at each lattice site and
unitary streaming operators which transmit information from one site to an
adjacent lattice site. Besides substantiating results from the theory for
Gaussian pulses, numerical simulations show their validity for non-Gaussian
pulses.

replaces the corresponding voxels in a second labeled image, and the annotation

exploiting the unique features of the radio physical layer to increase the
overall bandwidth. By exploiting both the original and the conjugate of the

both indoor and outdoor environments. We design a Seirios prototype and
evaluate its performance in an outdoor area of 100 m $\times$ 60 m, and an

the target as using only new data for model updating, meanwhile not sacrificing
the recommendation accuracy compared with full model retraining. This is
non-trivial to achieve, since the interaction data participates in both the
graph structure for model construction and the loss function for model
learning, whereas the old graph structure is not allowed to use in model
updating. Towards the goal, we propose a \textit{Causal Incremental Graph

combine the old representations and the incremental graph and effectively fuse

out-of-date issue of inactive nodes that are not in the incremental graph,
which connects the new data with inactive nodes through causal inference. In
particular, CED estimates the causal effect of new data on the representation

challenging decision-making tasks, the main bones of its success --- deep
neural networks are mostly black-boxes. A feasible way to gain insight into a
black-box model is to distill it into an interpretable model such as a decision
tree, which consists of if-then rules and is easy to grasp and be verified.
However, the traditional model distillation is usually a supervised learning
task under a stationary data distribution assumption, which is violated in
reinforcement learning. Therefore, a typical policy distillation that clones
model behaviors with even a small error could bring a data distribution shift,
resulting in an unsatisfied distilled policy model with low fidelity or low
performance. In this paper, we propose to address this issue by changing the
distillation objective from behavior cloning to maximizing an advantage
evaluation. The novel distillation objective maximizes an approximated
cumulative reward and focuses more on disastrous behaviors in critical states,
which controls the data shift effect. We evaluate our method on several Gym
tasks, a commercial fight game, and a self-driving car simulator. The empirical
results show that the proposed method can preserve a higher cumulative reward
than behavior cloning and learn a more consistent policy to the original one.
Moreover, by examining the extracted rules from the distilled decision trees,
we demonstrate that the proposed method delivers reasonable and robust
decisions.

investigated this question in an extinction-free way, by selecting 1120
infrared galaxies in the $AKARI$ North Ecliptic Pole Wide field at redshift $z$
$\leq$ 1.2. A unique feature of the $AKARI$ satellite is its continuous 9-band
infrared (IR) filter coverage, providing us with an unprecedentedly large
sample of IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies. By taking
advantage of this, for the first time, we explored the AGN activity derived
from SED modelling as a function of redshift, luminosity, and environment. We
quantified AGN activity in two ways: AGN contribution fraction (ratio of AGN
luminosity to the total IR luminosity), and AGN number fraction (ratio of
number of AGNs to the total galaxy sample). We found that galaxy environment
(normalised local density) does not greatly affect either definitions of AGN
activity of our IRG/LIRG samples (log ${\rm L}_{\rm TIR}$ $\leq$ 12). However,
we found a different behavior for ULIRGs (log ${\rm L}_{\rm TIR}$ $>$ 12). At
our highest redshift bin (0.7 $\lesssim$ z $\lesssim$ 1.2), AGN activity
increases with denser environments, but at the intermediate redshift bin (0.3
$\lesssim$ z $\lesssim$ 0.7), the opposite is observed. These results may hint
at a different physical mechanism for ULIRGs. The trends are not statistically
significant (p $\geq$ 0.060 at the intermediate redshift bin, and p $\geq$
0.139 at the highest redshift bin). Possible different behavior of ULIRGs is a
key direction to explore further with future space missions (e.g., $JWST$,

to be carried out even for a small change in domain parameters and/or material
properties. Therefore, fast and generalizable surrogate models are needed to
alleviate the computational burden but the discontinuous nature of fracture
mechanics presents a major challenge to developing such models. We propose a
physics-informed variational formulation of DeepONet (V-DeepONet) for brittle
fracture analysis. V-DeepONet is trained to map the initial configuration of
the defect to the relevant fields of interests (e.g., damage and displacement
fields). Once the network is trained, the entire global solution can be rapidly
obtained for any initial crack configuration and loading steps on that domain.
While the original DeepONet is solely data-driven, we take a different path to
train the V-DeepONet by imposing the governing equations in variational form
and we also use some labelled data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
V-DeepOnet through two benchmarks of brittle fracture, and we verify its
accuracy using results from high-fidelity solvers. Encoding the physical laws
and also some data to train the network renders the surrogate model capable of
accurately performing both interpolation and extrapolation tasks, considering
that fracture modeling is very sensitive to fluctuations. The proposed hybrid
training of V-DeepONet is superior to state-of-the-art methods and can be

control systems, they appear coupled to a linear input-output system in the
form of linear complementarity systems. Mimicking the program that led to the
foundation of bifurcation theory in smooth maps, we introduce a novel notion of
equivalence between linear complementarity problems that sets the basis for a
theory of bifurcations in a large class of nonsmooth maps, including, but not
restricted to, steadystate bifurcations in linear complementarity systems. Our
definition exploits the rich geometry of linear complementarity problems and
leads to constructive algebraic conditions for identifying and classifying the
nonsmooth singularities associated with nonsmooth bifurcations. We thoroughly
illustrate our theory on an extended applied example, the design of bistability
in an electrical network, and a more theoretical one, the identification and
classification of all possible equivalence classes in two-dimensional linear
complementarity problems.

There are some promising approaches, but many of them are based on a ""fair""
ground truth, others are based on a subjective goal to be reached, which leads
to the usual problem of how to define and compute ""fairness"". The different
functioning of algorithmic decision making in contrast to human decision making
leads to a shift from a process-oriented to a result-oriented discrimination
assessment. We argue that with such a shift society needs to determine which
kind of fairness is the right one to choose for which certain scenario. To
understand the implications of such a determination we explain the different
kinds of fairness concepts that might be applicable for the specific
application of hiring decisions, analyze their pros and cons with regard to the
respective fairness interpretation and evaluate them from a legal perspective
(based on EU law).

which introductory students acquire scientific knowledge. However, with modern
developments in science and technology, the social significance of learning
successive theories is steadily increasing, thus opening new areas of interest
to discipline-based education research, e.g., quantum logic, quantum
information and communication. Here we present an initial proposal for modeling
the transition from the understanding of a theory to the understanding of its
successor and explore its generative potential by applying it to a concrete
case: the classical-quantum transition in physics. In pursue of such task, we
make coordinated use of contributions not only from research on conceptual
change in education, but also on the history and philosophy of science, on the
teaching and learning of quantum mechanics, on mathematics education. By means
of analytical instruments developed for characterizing conceptual trajectories
at different representational levels, we review empirical literature in the
search for the connections between theory change and cognitive demands. The
analysis shows a rich landscape of changes and new challenges that are absent
in the traditionally considered cases of conceptual change. In order to fully
disclose the educational potential of the analysis, we visualize categorical
changes by means of dynamic frames, identifying recognizable patterns that
answer to students' need of comparability between the older and the new
paradigm. Finally, we show how the frame representation can be used to suggest
pattern-dependent strategies to promote the understanding of the new content,
and may work as a guide to curricular design.

  diagnosis of neuromuscular disorders",,,,,"cs.SI cs.CE cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Electromyography (EMG) refers to a biomedical signal indicating neuromuscular
activity and muscle morphology. Experts accurately diagnose neuromuscular
disorders using this time series. Modern data analysis techniques have recently
led to introducing novel approaches for mapping time series data to graphs and
complex networks with applications in diverse fields, including medicine. The
resulting networks develop a completely different visual acuity that can be
used to complement physician findings of time series. This can lead to a more
enriched analysis, reduced error, more accurate diagnosis of the disease, and
increased accuracy and speed of the treatment process. The mapping process may
cause the loss of essential data from the time series and not retain all the
time series features. As a result, achieving an approach that can provide a
good representation of the time series while maintaining essential features is
crucial. This paper proposes a new approach to network development named
GraphTS to overcome the limited accuracy of existing methods through EMG time
series using the visibility graph method. For this purpose, EMG signals are
pre-processed and mapped to a complex network by a standard visibility graph
algorithm. The resulting networks can differentiate between healthy and patient
samples. In the next step, the properties of the developed networks are given
in the form of a feature matrix as input to classifiers after extracting
optimal features. Performance evaluation of the proposed approach with deep
neural network shows 99.30% accuracy for training data and 99.18% for test
data. Therefore, in addition to enriched network representation and covering
the features of time series for healthy, myopathy, and neuropathy EMG, the
proposed technique improves accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score.

detectors used in high-energy physics experiments nowadays. It is a very fast
detector having low cost of fabrication. The RPCs are usually built using glass
or bakelite plates having high resistivity $\sim~10^{10}-10^{11}$ $\Omega$~cm.
Bakelite RPCs are generally fabricated with a linseed oil coating inside to
make the inner electrode surface smoother which helps to reduce the micro
discharge probability. Linseed oil coating also reduces the surface UV
sensitivity dramatically and effectively protect the bakelite surfaces from the
Hydrofluoric Acid (HF), produced by the interaction of fluorine with the water
vapour. There is a conventional way to do this linseed oil coating after making
the gas gap as done in experiments $e.g.$ ALICE, CMS etc. A new technique is
introduced here to do the linseed oil coating on the bakelite plate before
making the gas gap. 100\% Tetrafluoroethane (C$_2$H$_2$F$_4$) gas is used to
test the RPC module in the avalanche mode with cosmic rays. Conventional NIM
electronics is used for this study. The efficiency and noise rate are measured.
In this article, the detailed method of fabrication and the first test results

confirmed individually for all bipartitions of the $N$ systems, thus negating
the bilocal hidden state model for each bipartition) and genuine $N$-partite
steering (which excludes all convex combinations of the bilocal hidden state
models). Other definitions of multipartite steering are possible and we derive
inequalities to detect a stricter genuine $N$-partite steering based on only
one trusted site. The inequalities are expressed as variances of quadrature
phase amplitudes and thus apply to continuous variable systems. We show how
genuine $N$-partite steerable states can be created and detected for the nodes
of a network formed from a single-mode squeezed state passed through a sequence
of $N-1$ beam splitters. A stronger genuine $N$-partite steering is created, if
one uses two squeezed inputs, or $N$ squeezed inputs. We are able to confirm
that genuine tripartite steering (by the above definition and the stricter

steering and entanglement is distributed among the systems in the tripartite

benchmark the criteria, the inequalities derived in this paper are not based on
the assumption of Gaussian states, which gives advantage for quantum

where light right-handed neutrinos are coupled to all, or a fraction of, the

interaction only becomes important at late times and is uniquely probed by
late-time cosmological observables. Due to this coupling, the dark matter and
neutrinos behave as a single fluid with a non-trivial sound speed, leading to a
suppression of power on small scales. In current and near-term cosmological

on the origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs). However, it is a significant
observational challenge due to the nature of FRBs as transients with a radio
millisecond duration, which occur randomly in the sky regardless of time and
position. Here, we report the search for short-time fast optical bursts in the
GWAC archived data associated with FRB 20181130B, which were detected by the
Five Hundred Meter Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST) and recently reported. No
new credible sources were detected in all single GWAC images with an exposure
time of 10 s, including image with coverage of the expected arrival time in
optical wavelength by taking the high dispersion measurements into account. Our
results provide a limiting magnitude of 15.43$\pm0.04$ mag in R band,
corresponding to a flux density of 1.66 Jy or 8.35 mag in AB system by assuming
that the duration of the optical band is similar to that of the radio band of
about 10 ms. This limiting magnitude makes the spectral index of $\alpha<0.367$
from optical to radio wavelength. The possible existence of longer duration
optical emission was also investigated with an upper limits of 0.33 Jy (10.10
mag), 1.74 mJy (15.80 mag) and 0.16 mJy (18.39 mag) for the duration of 50 ms,

attributed to the shallow detection capability, as well as the high inferred

key issues when exchanging information between the encoder and decoder: 1)
taking into account the differences in contribution between different-level

Unlike existing CNN-based methods, we adopt a transformer encoder, which learns
more powerful and robust representations. In addition, considering the image
acquisition influence and elusive properties of polyps, we introduce three
standard modules, including a cascaded fusion module (CFM), a camouflage
identification module (CIM), and a similarity aggregation module (SAM). Among
these, the CFM is used to collect the semantic and location information of
polyps from high-level features; the CIM is applied to capture polyp
information disguised in low-level features, and the SAM extends the pixel
features of the polyp area with high-level semantic position information to the
entire polyp area, thereby effectively fusing cross-level features. The
proposed model, named Polyp-PVT, effectively suppresses noises in the features
and significantly improves their expressive capabilities. Extensive experiments
on five widely adopted datasets show that the proposed model is more robust to
various challenging situations (\emph{e.g.}, appearance changes, small objects,
rotation) than existing representative methods. The proposed model is available

research interests because of its scalability and possibility for real-world
applications. State-of-the-art unsupervised re-ID methods usually follow a
clustering-based strategy, which generates pseudo labels by clustering and
maintains a memory to store instance features and represent the centroid of the
clusters for contrastive learning. This approach suffers two problems. First,
the centroid generated by unsupervised learning may not be a perfect prototype.
Forcing images to get closer to the centroid emphasizes the result of
clustering, which could accumulate clustering errors during iterations. Second,
previous methods utilize features obtained at different training iterations to
represent one centroid, which is not consistent with the current training
sample, since the features are not directly comparable. To this end, we propose
an unsupervised re-ID approach with a stochastic learning strategy.
Specifically, we adopt a stochastic updated memory, where a random instance
from a cluster is used to update the cluster-level memory for contrastive
learning. In this way, the relationship between randomly selected pair of
images are learned to avoid the training bias caused by unreliable pseudo
labels. The stochastic memory is also always up-to-date for classifying to keep
the consistency. Besides, to relieve the issue of camera variance, a unified
distance matrix is proposed during clustering, where the distance bias from
different camera domain is reduced and the variances of identities is
emphasized.

  with Few Samples",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Surface defect detection plays an increasingly important role in
manufacturing industry to guarantee the product quality. Many deep learning
methods have been widely used in surface defect detection tasks, and have been
proven to perform well in defects classification and location. However, deep
learning-based detection methods often require plenty of data for training,
which fail to apply to the real industrial scenarios since the distribution of
defect categories is often imbalanced. In other words, common defect classes
have many samples but rare defect classes have extremely few samples, and it is
difficult for these methods to well detect rare defect classes. To solve the
imbalanced distribution problem, in this paper we propose TL-SDD: a novel
Transfer Learning-based method for Surface Defect Detection. First, we adopt a
two-phase training scheme to transfer the knowledge from common defect classes
to rare defect classes. Second, we propose a novel Metric-based Surface Defect
Detection (M-SDD) model. We design three modules for this model: (1) feature
extraction module: containing feature fusion which combines high-level semantic
information with low-level structural information. (2) feature reweighting
module: transforming examples to a reweighting vector that indicates the
importance of features. (3) distance metric module: learning a metric space in
which defects are classified by computing distances to representations of each
category. Finally, we validate the performance of our proposed method on a real
dataset including surface defects of aluminum profiles. Compared to the
baseline methods, the performance of our proposed method has improved by up to
11.98% for rare defect classes.

Conventionally, manual annotation of the corner vowels from speech data is
required before measuring vowel articulation. This process is time-consuming.
The present work aims to reduce human effort in clinical analysis of PD speech
by proposing an automatic pipeline for vowel articulation assessment. The
method is based on automatic corner vowel detection using a language universal
phoneme recognizer, followed by statistical analysis of the formant data. The
approach removes the restrictions of prior knowledge of speaking content and
the language in question. Experimental results on a Finnish PD speech corpus
demonstrate the efficacy and reliability of the proposed automatic method in
deriving VAI, VSA, FCR and F2i/F2u (the second formant ratio for vowels /i/ and

with features computed with manual annotations of corner vowels. In addition,
automatically and manually computed vowel articulation features have comparable
correlations with experts' ratings on speech intelligibility, voice impairment

implementations of such abstractions in RC11 RAR can be verified by developing
a (contextual) refinement framework for abstract objects. Our framework,
including the operational semantics, verification technique for client-library

  for Map Construction","7 pages, 7figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Channel knowledge map (CKM) is an emerging technique to enable
environment-aware wireless communications, in which databases with
location-specific channel knowledge are used to facilitate or even obviate
real-time channel state information acquisition. One fundamental problem for
CKM-enabled communication is how to efficiently construct the CKM based on
finite measurement data points at limited user locations. Towards this end,
this paper proposes a novel map construction method based on the
\emph{expectation maximization} (EM) algorithm, by utilizing the available
measurement data, jointly with the expert knowledge of well-established
statistic channel models. The key idea is to partition the available data
points into different groups, where each group shares the same modelling
parameter values to be determined. We show that determining the modelling
parameter values can be formulated as a maximum likelihood estimation problem
with latent variables, which is then efficiently solved by the classic EM
algorithm. Compared to the pure data-driven methods such as the nearest
neighbor based interpolation, the proposed method is more efficient since only
a small number of modelling parameters need to be determined and stored.
Furthermore, the proposed method is extended for constructing a specific type
of CKM, namely, the channel gain map (CGM), where closed-form expressions are
derived for the E-step and M-step of the EM algorithm. Numerical results are
provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed map construction method as
compared to the benchmark curve fitting method with one single model.

Carlo simulations that in both models, the $\frac{1}{2}$ plateau shows up in
the magnetization curve being relatively robust against the breathing
bond-alternation, although magnetic long-range orders (LRO's) are realized only
in the site-phonon model. In the bond-phonon model, additional further neighbor
interactions are necessary to induce a magnetic LRO. In the site-phonon model,
it is also found that in addition to the low-field, middle-field 1/2-plateau,
and high-field phases appearing on both the uniform and breathing pyrochlore

in units of tetrahedron are induced by the breathing bond-alternation just

We demonstrate that localised and lattice chiral resonances display
enantiomeric sensitivity. However, only the localised resonances exhibit strong
dependency on the structure of the chiral media detected. This can be
attributed to the ability of birefringent chiral layers to strongly modify the
properties of near fields by acting as a sink / source of optical chirality,
and hence alter inductive coupling between nanostructure elements. In addition,
we highlight how surface morphology / defects may amplify sensing capabilities

popularity bias. Moreover, it does so irrespective of user characteristics

propose to investigate popularity differences (between the user profile and

well as similarity measures that consider the entire popularity distributions

results in a more detailed picture of the characteristics of popularity bias.

and conduct experiments on the recently released standardized LFM-2b dataset,
containing listening profiles of Last.fm users. We investigate the algorithmic
popularity bias of seven common recommendation algorithms (five collaborative

provide novel insights into popularity bias in comparison with only using
average differences, (2) algorithms less inclined towards popularity bias
amplification do not necessarily perform worse in terms of utility (NDCG), (3)
the majority of the investigated recommenders intensify the popularity bias of

three--fold: First, for any integer $\ell\geq3$, we show that the densities and
velocities converge to their corresponding equilibrium states at the $L^2$ rate
$(1+t)^{-\frac{3}{4}}$, and the $k$($\in [1, \ell]$)--order spatial derivatives
of them converge to zero at the $L^2$ rate $(1+t)^{-\frac{3}{4}-\frac{k}{2}}$,
which are the same as ones of the compressible Navier--Stokes system,
Navier--Stokes--Korteweg system and heat equation. Second, the linear
combination of the fraction densities
($\beta^+\alpha^+\rho^++\beta^-\alpha^-\rho^-$) converges to its corresponding
equilibrium state at the $L^2$ rate $(1+t)^{-\frac{3}{4}}$, and its $k$($\in
[1, \ell]$)--order spatial derivative converges to zero at the $L^2$ rate
$(1+t)^{-\frac{3}{4}-\frac{k}{2}}$, but the fraction densities
($\alpha^\pm\rho^\pm$) themselves converge to their corresponding equilibrium
states at the $L^2$ rate $(1+t)^{-\frac{1}{4}}$, and the $k$($\in [1,

$(1+t)^{-\frac{1}{4}-\frac{k}{2}}$, which are slower than ones of their linear
combination ($\beta^+\alpha^+\rho^++\beta^-\alpha^-\rho^-$) and the densities.
We think that this phenomenon should owe to the special structure of the
system. Finally, for well--chosen initial data, we also prove the lower bounds
on the decay rates, which are the same as those of the upper decay rates.
Therefore, these decay rates are optimal for the compressible two--fluid model.

supervised label information is no longer available when using the model during

is able to detect real drift, where the drift affects the classification
performance, while it properly ignores virtual drift, where the classification
performance is not affected by the drift. In the proposed framework, the actual
method to detect a change in the statistics of incoming data samples can be
chosen freely. Experimental evaluation on nine benchmarks datasets, with
different types of drift, demonstrates that the proposed framework can reliably
detect drifts, and outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised drift detection

of weights and/or activations to lighten network architectures. Quantization
methods use a rounding function to map full-precision values to the nearest
quantized ones, but this operation is not differentiable. There are mainly two
approaches to training quantized networks with gradient-based optimizers.
First, a straight-through estimator (STE) replaces the zero derivative of the
rounding with that of an identity function, which causes a gradient mismatch
problem. Second, soft quantizers approximate the rounding with continuous
functions at training time, and exploit the rounding for quantization at test
time. This alleviates the gradient mismatch, but causes a quantizer gap
problem. We alleviate both problems in a unified framework. To this end, we
introduce a novel quantizer, dubbed a distance-aware quantizer (DAQ), that
mainly consists of a distance-aware soft rounding (DASR) and a temperature
controller. To alleviate the gradient mismatch problem, DASR approximates the
discrete rounding with the kernel soft argmax, which is based on our insight
that the quantization can be formulated as a distance-based assignment problem
between full-precision values and quantized ones. The controller adjusts the
temperature parameter in DASR adaptively according to the input, addressing the
quantizer gap problem. Experimental results on standard benchmarks show that
DAQ outperforms the state of the art significantly for various bit-widths

In this work a first systematic approach is presented that describes the change
of the abundances from the thermal to the non-thermal state via non-linear
diffusive shock acceleration by a temporally evolving shock. Hereby, not only
time-dependent ionization states of elements contained in the ambient gas are
considered, but also elements condensed on solid, charged dust grains, which
not only can be injected into the acceleration process as well, but are from
our findings even the dominant injection channel for most heavy elements. This
generic parametrized model is then applied to the case of particle acceleration
by supernova remnants in various ISM phases as well as Wolf-Rayet (WR) wind
environments. We show that the overall low to medium energy cosmic ray
distribution by WR explosions yield a significantly harder, which makes this
contribution quite promising in order to explain the spectral hardening of the
flux of certain elements, such as helium, observed by AMS-02 and other
experiments at rigidities of about 1 TV, which would also be an important test

Gravastar is conceptually a substitute for a black hole theory as available in

routinely create approximate implementations of circuits and programs that show
excellent trade-offs between the quality of output and required resources. This
paper deals with evolutionary approximation as one of the popular approximation
methods. The paper provides the first survey of evolutionary algorithm
(EA)-based approaches applied in the context of approximate computing. The
survey reveals that EAs are primarily applied as multi-objective optimizers. We
propose to divide these approaches into two main classes: (i) parameter
optimization in which the EA optimizes a vector of system parameters, and (ii)
synthesis and optimization in which EA is responsible for determining the
architecture and parameters of the resulting system. The evolutionary
approximation has been applied at all levels of design abstraction and in many
different applications. The neural architecture search enabling the automated
hardware-aware design of approximate deep neural networks was identified as a
newly emerging topic in this area.

paradox teaches us that the converse can also happen when randomness is at
play. The paradox comes from probability theory, where it is often illustrated
by measuring how long passengers wait upon arriving at a bus stop at a random

time between bus arrivals -- a counter-intuitive result, since one expects to
wait less when coming some time after the previous bus departed. In this

reliable fault detector and mitigator with respect to relevant bit flips,
adopting an eight-exponent floating point data representation. We further
explore novel, non-uniform range restriction methods that effectively suppress
the probability of silent data corruptions and uncorrectable errors. As a

challenging task in real-world scenarios due to various factors, including
intra-class variance, class imbalance, and occlusion. Most of the previous
methods rarely solve the cases that the prohibited items are deliberately
hidden in messy objects due to the lack of large-scale datasets, restricted
their applications in real-world scenarios. Towards real-world prohibited item
detection, we collect a large-scale dataset, named as PIDray, which covers
various cases in real-world scenarios for prohibited item detection, especially
for deliberately hidden items. With an intensive amount of effort, our dataset
contains $12$ categories of prohibited items in $47,677$ X-ray images with
high-quality annotated segmentation masks and bounding boxes. To the best of
our knowledge, it is the largest prohibited items detection dataset to date.
Meanwhile, we design the selective dense attention network (SDANet) to
construct a strong baseline, which consists of the dense attention module and
the dependency refinement module. The dense attention module formed by the
spatial and channel-wise dense attentions, is designed to learn the
discriminative features to boost the performance. The dependency refinement
module is used to exploit the dependencies of multi-scale features. Extensive
experiments conducted on the collected PIDray dataset demonstrate that the
proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods,
especially for detecting the deliberately hidden items.

We analyse three-Higgs-doublet models with an underlying $S_3$ symmetry. These

are active, and therefore the active sector, in many aspects, behaves like a
two-Higgs-doublet model. The way the fermions couple to the scalar sector is
constrained by the $S_3$ symmetry and is such that the flavour structure of the
model is solely governed by the $V_\text{CKM}$ matrix which, in our framework,

leveraging auxiliary information, such as attribute embedding. Despite the
encouraging results achieved, prior ZSL approaches focus on improving the
discriminant power of seen-class features, yet have largely overlooked the
geometric structure of the samples and the prototypes. The subsequent
attribute-based generative adversarial network (GAN), as a result, also
neglects the topological information in sample generation and further yields
inferior performances in classifying the visual features of unseen classes. In
this paper, we introduce a novel structure-aware feature generation scheme,

introduce a constraint loss to preserve the initial geometric structure when
learning a discriminative latent space, and carry out our GAN training with
additional supervising signals from a structure-aware discriminator and a
reconstruction module. The former supervision distinguishes fake and real

reconstruct the original feature space from the generated latent space. This
topology-preserving mechanism enables our method to significantly enhance the
generalization capability on unseen-classes and consequently improve the

includes a partially specified vaccination policy and takes into account
fatigue from protracted application of social distancing measures. The model
assumes demographic (age related) categories, and is otherwise homogeneous.
Maximum capacity for vaccination is exogenous and the authorities select its
allocation to the categories. They can also adopt measures to uniformly
diminish the contact rate between infected and susceptible individuals at an
economic cost. Total or partial immunity is modeled, while the contact rate is
allowed to exhibit seasonality. We apply optimal control methods to minimize a
cost index while guaranteeing that health system capacity is not exceeded. A
reasonable parameter selection leads to policies specifying that vaccination
priority should be given to the category with a higher demand for the limited
health care resources regardless of cost variations among categories.
Vaccination priority reverses if some demographic category has significantly
higher mobility while for some parameter values vaccination alternates among
categories. Optimal social distancing policies exhibit seasonality, and hence
reducing susceptibles below the average spontaneous disease extinction level
does not necessarily lead to a repeal of social distancing.

thermal protons, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) theory is well equipped to describe
the nature of solar wind turbulence. The turbulent spectrum itself is defined
by a power-law manifesting the energy cascading process. A break in the
turbulence spectrum develops near ion scales, signaling the onset of energy
dissipation. The exact mechanism for the spectral break is still a matter of
debate. In this work, we use the 20 Hz \textit{MESSENGER} magnetic field data
during four planetary flybys at different heliocentric distances to examine the
nature of the spectral break in the solar wind. %By carefully selecting the
spacecraft trajectory, We relate the spectral break frequencies of the solar
wind MHD turbulence, found in the range of $0.3$ to $0.7$ Hz, with the
well-known characteristic spectral bump at frequencies $\sim 1$ Hz upstream of
planetary bow shocks. Spectral breaks and spectral bumps during three planetary
flybys are identified from the \textit{MESSENGER} observations, with
heliocentric distances in the range of $0.3$ to $0.7$ au. The
\textit{MESSENGER} observations are complemented by one \textit{MMS}
observation made at 1 au. We find that the ratio of the spectral bump frequency
to the spectral break frequency appears to be $r$- and $B$- independent. From
this, we postulate that the wavenumber of the spectral break and the frequency
of the spectral bump have the same dependence on the magnetic field strength
$|B|$. The implication of our work on the nature of the break scale is
discussed.

in recognising and fixing bugs. Misconceptions often lead to recurring patterns
of similar bugs, enabling automated tools to provide this support in terms of
hints on occurrences of common bug patterns. In this paper, we investigate to
what extent the hints improve the effectiveness and efficiency of teachers in
debugging learners' programs using a cohort of 163 primary school teachers in
training, tasked to correct buggy Scratch programs, with and without hints on
bug patterns. Our experiment suggests that automatically generated hints can
reduce the effort of finding and fixing bugs from 8.66 to 5.24 minutes, while
increasing the effectiveness by 34% more correct solutions. While this
improvement is convincing, arguably teachers in training might first need to
learn debugging ""the hard way"" to not miss the opportunity to learn by relying
on tools. We therefore investigate whether the use of hints during training
affects their ability to recognise and fix bugs without hints. Our experiment
provides no significant evidence that either learning to debug with hints or
learning to debug ""the hard way"" leads to better learning effects. Overall,
this suggests that bug patterns might be a useful concept to include in the
curriculum for teachers in training, while tool-support to recognise these
patterns is desirable for teachers in practice.

important class of spin systems beyond the usual Gaudin magnet. These systems
are relevant to several realistic setups and serve as an interesting platform
to study interaction controlled decoherence and frustration induced instability
of magnetic order. Using an equations-of-motion method based on analytical
representations of spin-operator matrix elements in the XX chain, we obtain
exact long-time dynamics of a generalized Heisenberg star consisting of a
spin-$S$ central spin and an inhomogeneously coupled XXZ chain of $N\leq 16$
bath spins. In contrast to previous studies where the central spin dynamics is
mainly concerned, we focus on the influence of the central spin on the dynamics
of magnetic orders within the spin bath. By preparing the XXZ bath in a N\'eel
state, we find that in the gapless phase of the bath even weak system-bath
coupling could lead to nearly perfect relaxation of the antiferromagnetic
order. In the gapped phase, the staggered magnetization decays rapidly and
approaches a steady value that increases with increasing anisotropy parameter.
These findings suggest the possibility of controlling internal dynamics of
strongly correlated many-spin systems by certain coupled auxiliary systems of
even few degrees of freedom. We also study the dynamics of the R\'enyi
entanglement entropy of the central spin when the bath is prepared in the
ground state. Both the overall profile and initial growth rate of the R\'enyi
entropy are found to exhibit minima at the critical point of the XXZ bath.

leap-forwards in dense image prediction. However, the issue of feature
alignment remains as neglected by most existing approaches for simplicity.
Direct pixel addition between upsampled and local features leads to feature
maps with misaligned contexts that, in turn, translate to mis-classifications
in prediction, especially on object boundaries. In this paper, we propose a
feature alignment module that learns transformation offsets of pixels to
contextually align upsampled higher-level features; and another feature
selection module to emphasize the lower-level features with rich spatial
details. We then integrate these two modules in a top-down pyramidal
architecture and present the Feature-aligned Pyramid Network (FaPN). Extensive
experimental evaluations on four dense prediction tasks and four datasets have
demonstrated the efficacy of FaPN, yielding an overall improvement of 1.2 - 2.6

and grid operators. To defend against such events, it is necessary to identify
the causes of interruptions in the power distribution network. In this work, we
focus on the power grid of a Norwegian community in the Arctic that experiences
several faults whose sources are unknown. First, we construct a data set
consisting of relevant meteorological data and information about the current
power quality logged by power-quality meters. Then, we adopt machine-learning
techniques to predict the occurrence of faults. Experimental results show that
both linear and non-linear classifiers achieve good classification performance.
This indicates that the considered power-quality and weather variables explain
well the power disturbances. Interpreting the decision process of the
classifiers provides valuable insights to understand the main causes of
disturbances. Traditional features selection methods can only indicate which
are the variables that, on average, mostly explain the fault occurrences in the
dataset. Besides providing such a global interpretation, it is also important
to identify the specific set of variables that explain each individual fault.
To address this challenge, we adopt a recent technique to interpret the
decision process of a deep learning model, called Integrated Gradients. The
proposed approach allows to gain detailed insights on the occurrence of a
specific fault, which are valuable for the distribution system operators to
implement strategies to prevent and mitigate power disturbances.

We propose a mathematical framework to study the underlying physical mechanism
responsible for the entrapment and subsequently delayed settling times of

self-propelling through a cloud of micron-sized evaporating droplets. This
configuration might be utilized to approximate an indoor environment in which
similar unsteady vortical flow structures interact with exhaled respiratory
droplets. We demonstrate the vortex dipole effect on droplet and solid
particles settling distances, depending on the evaporation rate, the vorticity
of the dipole, and the droplet's initial diameter and location relative to the
vortex core. Our theoretical analysis reveals non-intuitive interactions
between the vortex dipole, droplet relaxation time, gravity, and mass transfer.
The existence of optimal conditions for maximum displacement is suggested,
where the droplet entrainment reaches up to an order of magnitude larger than
the vortex core length scale. We present a basic model that may be applied for
evaluating the spread of exhaled respiratory droplets in vortical environments.
Our theoretical study suggests that exhaled respiratory droplets initially at

comparable to well-known sharp bounds in the planted bi-section model; (2) a
construction of confidence sets for the community assignment from credible
sets, with finite graph sizes. The latter enables exact frequentist uncertain
quantification with Bayesian credible sets at non-asymptotic graph sizes, where
posteriors can be simulated well. There turns out to be no proportionality
between credible and confidence levels: for given edge probabilities and a
desired confidence level, there exists a critical graph size where the required
credible level drops sharply from close to one to close to zero. At such graph
sizes the frequentist decides to include not most of the posterior support for
the construction of his confidence set, but only a small subset of community
assignments containing the highest amounts of posterior probability (like the
maximum-a-posteriori estimator). It is argued that for the proposed
construction of confidence sets, a form of early stopping applies to MCMC
sampling of the posterior, which would enable the computation of confidence
sets at larger graph sizes.

  Retrieval",,,,,"cs.IR cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Semantic text matching is a critical problem in information retrieval.
Recently, deep learning techniques have been widely used in this area and
obtained significant performance improvements. However, most models are black
boxes and it is hard to understand what happened in the matching process, due
to the poor interpretability of deep learning. This paper aims at tackling this
problem. The key idea is to test whether existing deep text matching methods
satisfy some fundamental heuristics in information retrieval. Specifically,
four heuristics are used in our study, i.e., term frequency constraint, term
discrimination constraint, length normalization constraints, and TF-length
constraint. Since deep matching models usually contain many parameters, it is
difficult to conduct a theoretical study for these complicated functions. In
this paper, We propose an empirical testing method. Specifically, We first
construct some queries and documents to make them satisfy the assumption in a
constraint, and then test to which extend a deep text matching model trained on
the original dataset satisfies the corresponding constraint. Besides, a famous
attribution based interpretation method, namely integrated gradient, is adopted
to conduct detailed analysis and guide for feasible improvement. Experimental
results on LETOR 4.0 and MS Marco show that all the investigated deep text
matching methods, both representation and interaction based methods, satisfy
the above constraints with high probabilities in statistics. We further extend
these constraints to the semantic settings, which are shown to be better
satisfied for all the deep text matching models. These empirical findings give
clear understandings on why deep text matching models usually perform well in
information retrieval. We believe the proposed evaluation methodology will be
useful for testing future deep text matching models.

non-oscillatory entropy stable flux ($\hat{F}$) as a simple combination of
$(F^*$ and $F^s)$ which inherently optimize the numerical diffusion in the

Various non-oscillatory entropy stable fluxes are constructed and exhaustive

these entropy stable schemes completely remove spurious oscillations in
approximating the discontinuities compared to the non-oscillatory schemes using

information on the thermodynamic and magnetic properties of solar and stellar
atmospheres. In recent years, very sophisticated inversion codes have been
developed that are now routinely applied to spectro-polarimetric observations.
Most of these inversion codes are designed for finding an optimum solution to
the nonlinear inverse problem. However, to obtain the location of potentially
multimodal cases (ambiguities), the degeneracies, and the uncertainties of each
parameter inferred from the inversions, algorithms such as Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC), require to evaluate the likelihood of the model thousand of times
and are computationally costly. Variational methods are a quick alternative to
Monte Carlo methods by approximating the posterior distribution by a
parametrized distribution. In this study, we introduce a highly flexible
variational inference method to perform fast Bayesian inference, known as
normalizing flows. Normalizing flows are a set of invertible, differentiable,
and parametric transformations that convert a simple distribution into an
approximation of any other complex distribution. If the transformations are
conditioned on observations, the normalizing flows can be trained to return
Bayesian posterior probability estimates for any observation. We illustrate the
ability of the method using a simple Milne-Eddington model and a complex
non-LTE inversion. However, the method is extremely general and other more
complex forward models can be applied. The training procedure need only be
performed once for a given prior parameter space and the resulting network can
then generate samples describing the posterior distribution several orders of
magnitude faster than existing techniques.

computational and storage efficiency. Recently, deep unsupervised hashing
methods have attracted increasing attention due to the high cost of human
annotations in the real world and the superiority of deep learning technology.
However, most deep unsupervised hashing methods usually pre-compute a
similarity matrix to model the pairwise relationship in the pre-trained feature
space. Then this similarity matrix would be used to guide hash learning, in
which most of the data pairs are treated equivalently. The above process is
confronted with the following defects: 1) The pre-computed similarity matrix is
inalterable and disconnected from the hash learning process, which cannot
explore the underlying semantic information. 2) The informative data pairs may
be buried by the large number of less-informative data pairs. To solve the
aforementioned problems, we propose a Deep Self-Adaptive Hashing (DSAH) model
to adaptively capture the semantic information with two special designs:
Adaptive Neighbor Discovery (AND) and Pairwise Information Content (PIC).
Firstly, we adopt the AND to initially construct a neighborhood-based
similarity matrix, and then refine this initial similarity matrix with a novel
update strategy to further investigate the semantic structure behind the
learned representation. Secondly, we measure the priorities of data pairs with
PIC and assign adaptive weights to them, which is relies on the assumption that
more dissimilar data pairs contain more discriminative information for hash
learning. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate that the above
two technologies facilitate the deep hashing model to achieve superior
performance.

Binary (HMXB) pulsar Vela X-1 over a period of 46 yr. Our analysis indicates
nearly periodic variations in the spin period of the pulsar on time-scales of
about 5.9 yr. There is suggestion of an overall spin-down behaviour of the
pulsar though it is noticed that the source appears to stay near its
equilibrium period 283.4 s since MJD 51000, with rather erratic
spin-up/spin-down episodes around this value. Our study suggests nearly cyclic
turnover in the spin behaviour of the pulsar from spin-up to spin-down regimes
on time-scales of about 17-19 yr. To our knowledge this is the first report of
periodic variation in the spin behaviour of a wind-fed accreting pulsar. We
also observe erratic episodes of spin-up and spin-down behaviour on relatively
shorter time-scales which is a well known archetype of this wind-fed X-ray
pulsar. We investigate whether nearly periodic long-term spin period changes in
the pulsar can be explained by using known mechanisms of torque reversals in
the accretion powered neutron stars. It appears that changes in the accretion
environment of the pulsar using current ideas can probably lead to long-term
spin period changes in this X-ray pulsar.

with functional regressors and responses. We develop new inference tools to
quantify deviations of the true slope $S$ from a hypothesized operator $S_0$
with respect to the Hilbert--Schmidt norm $\| S- S_0\|^2$, as well as the
prediction error $\mathbb{E} \| S X - S_0 X \|^2$. Our analysis is applicable
to functional time series and based on asymptotically pivotal statistics. This
makes it particularly user friendly, because it avoids the choice of tuning
parameters inherent in long-run variance estimation or bootstrap of dependent
data. We also discuss two sample problems as well as change point detection.
Finite sample properties are investigated by means of a simulation study.\\
Mathematically our approach is based on a sequential version of the popular
spectral cut-off estimator $\hat S_N$ for $S$. It is well-known that the
$L^2$-minimax rates in the functional regression model, both in estimation and
prediction, are substantially slower than $1/\sqrt{N}$ (where $N$ denotes the
sample size) and that standard estimators for $S$ do not converge weakly to
non-degenerate limits. However, we demonstrate that simple plug-in estimators -
such as $\| \hat S_N - S_0 \|^2$ for $\| S - S_0 \|^2$ - are
$\sqrt{N}$-consistent and its sequential versions satisfy weak invariance
principles. These results are based on the smoothing effect of $L^2$-norms and
established by a new proof-technique, the {\it smoothness shift}, which has
potential applications in other statistical inverse problems.

isotropic exchange or dipole-dipole interaction, present in all magnetic
materials, which acquire asymmetric contributions in case of curved geometry of
the specimen. As a result, for example, the spin-wave dispersion in round
magnetic nanotubes becomes asymmetric, namely spin waves of the same frequency
propagating in opposite directions along the nanotube exhibit different
wavelenghts. Here, using time-resolved scanning transmission X-ray microscopy
experiments, standard micromagntic simulations and a dynamic-matrix approach,
we show that the spin-wave spectrum undergoes additional drastic changes when
transitioning from a continuous to a discrete rotational symmetry, i.e. from
round to hexagonal nanotubes, which are much easier to fabricate. The polygonal
shape introduces localization of the modes both to the sharp, highly curved
corners and flat edges. Moreover, due to the discrete rotational symmetry, the
degenerate nature of the modes with azimuthal wave vectors known from round
tubes is partly lifted, resulting in singlet and duplet modes. For comparison
with our experiments, we calculate the microwave absorption from the
numerically obtained mode profiles which shows that a dedicated antenna design
is paramount for magnonic applications in 3D nano-structures. To our knowledge

introduce multi-task learning (MTL) to solve data insufficiency. To this end,
Task-wise Split Gradient Boosting Trees (TSGB) is proposed for the multi-center

bilayer systems. Mechanisms of skyrmion collapse are identified and
corresponding energy barriers and thermal collapse rates are evaluated as
functions of the interlayer exchange coupling and mutual stacking of the
monolayers using transition state theory and an atomistic spin Hamiltonian. In
order to contrast the results to monolayer systems, the magnetic interactions
within each layer are chosen so as to mimic the well-established Pd/Fe/Ir(111)
system. Even bilayer systems demonstrate a rich diversity of skyrmion collapse
mechanisms that sometimes co-exist. For very weakly coupled layers, the
skyrmions in each layer decay successively via radially-symmetric shrinking.
Slightly larger coupling leads to an asymmetric chimera collapse stabilized by
interlayer exchange. When the interlayer exchange coupling reaches a certain
critical value, the skyrmions collapse simultaneously. Interestingly, the
overall energy barrier for the skyrmion collapse does not always converge to a
multiple of that for a monolayer system in the strongly coupled regime. For a
certain stacking of the magnetic layers, the energy barrier as a function of
the interlayer exchange coupling features a maximum and then decreases with the
coupling strength in the strong coupling regime. Calculated mechanisms of
skyrmion collapse are used to ultimately predict the skyrmion lifetime. Our
results reveal a comprehensive picture of thermal stability of skyrmions in
magnetic multilayers and provide a perspective for realizing skyrmions with

reconstruction with minimized LAR artifacts from low- and high-kVp data over

Methods: Image reconstruction from LAR data is formulated as a convex
optimization problem in which data-$\ell_2$ is minimized with constraints on
image's DTVs along orthogonal axes. We then achieve image reconstruction by
applying the DTV algorithm to solve the optimization problem. We conduct
numerical studies from data generated over arcs of LARs, ranging from
$14^\circ$ to $180^\circ$, and perform visual inspection and quantitative
analysis of images reconstructed. Results: Monochromatic images of interest
obtained with the DTV algorithm from LAR data show substantially reduced
artifacts that are observed often in images obtained with existing algorithms.
The improved image quality also leads to accurate estimation of physical
quantities of interest, such as effective atomic number and iodine-contrast
concentration. Conclusion: Our study reveals that from LAR data of low- and
high-kVp, monochromatic images can be obtained that are visually, and physical
quantities can be estimated that are quantitatively, comparable to those

application significance.

quickly assemble working programs and games, but this often leads to low code
quality. Such code can be hard to comprehend, changing it is error-prone, and
learners may struggle and lose interest. The general solution to improve code
quality is to refactor the code. However, Scratch lacks many of the common
abstraction mechanisms used when refactoring programs written in higher

set of atomic code transformations to optimise readability by (1) rewriting
control structures and (2) simplifying scripts using the inherently concurrent
nature of Scratch programs. By automating these transformations it is possible
to explore the space of possible variations of Scratch programs. In this paper,
we describe a multi-objective search-based approach that determines sequences

a significant number of repetitive strokes to create textures. Existing
automatic stroke synthesis methods are usually limited to predefined styles or
require indirect manipulation that may break the spontaneous flow of drawing.
We present a method to autocomplete repetitive short strokes during users'
normal drawing process. Users can draw over a reference image as usual. At the
same time, our system silently analyzes the input strokes and the reference to
infer strokes that follow users' input style when certain repetition is
detected. Users can accept, modify, or ignore the system predictions and
continue drawing, thus maintaining the fluid control of drawing. Our key idea
is to jointly analyze image regions and operation history for detecting and
predicting repetitions. The proposed system can effectively reduce users'
workload in drawing repetitive short strokes and facilitates users in creating
results with rich patterns.

and quality of life. Monitoring stations have been established to continuously
obtain air quality information, but they do not cover all areas. Thus, there
are numerous methods for spatially fine-grained air quality inference. Since
existing methods aim to infer air quality of locations only in monitored
cities, they do not assume inferring air quality in unmonitored cities. In this
paper, we first study the air quality inference in unmonitored cities. To
accurately infer air quality in unmonitored cities, we propose a neural
network-based approach AIREX. The novelty of AIREX is employing a
mixture-of-experts approach, which is a machine learning technique based on the
divide-and-conquer principle, to learn correlations of air quality between
multiple cities. To further boost the performance, it employs attention
mechanisms to compute impacts of air quality inference from the monitored
cities to the locations in the unmonitored city. We show, through experiments
on a real-world air quality dataset, that AIREX achieves higher accuracy than

selective transformations are driven by a control-flow analysis that is

This work introduces a method to count vehicles from traffic videos that

Pan-Tilt-Zoom cameras, which are frequently used in developing countries.
Preliminary results indicate that the proposed method achieves an average

stochastic delay processes with nonlinear time-local forces and linear
time-delayed forces that obey fluctuation theorems and converge to a Boltzmann
equilibrium at long times. From the point of view of control theory, such
``equilibrium stochastic delay processes'' are stable and energetically
passive, by construction. Computationally, they provide diverse exact
constraints on general nonlinear stochastic delay problems and can, in various
situations, serve as a starting point for their perturbative analysis.
Physically, they admit an interpretation in terms of an underdamped Brownian
particle that is either subjected to a time-local force in a non-Markovian
thermal bath or to a delayed feedback force in a Markovian thermal bath. We
illustrate these properties numerically for a setup familiar from feedback
cooling and point out experimental implications.

its interesting properties and important applications. Some typical lattices
have been proposed to generate flat bands, such as Kagome and Lieb lattices.
The flat bands in these lattices contact with other bands rather than isolated.
However, an ideal flat band should be isolated, because isolation is a
prerequisite for a number of important applications. Here, we propose a new
lattice that can produce isolated flat bands. The lattice is named as
interlocking-circles lattice because its pattern seems like interlocking
circles. Moreover, the new lattice is realized in graphene by hydrogenation. In
the hydrogenated graphene, there are two nontrivial isolated flat bands
appearing around the Fermi level. Upon hole or electron doping, the flat bands
split into spin-polarized bands and then result in a ferromagnetic graphene.
Our work not only proposes a new type of lattice but also opens a way to find
systems with isolated flat bands.

Ultra-Violet (UV) light and oxygen is the dominant degradation mechanism
affecting the lifespan of LDPE. In this work, we propose evolution functions
for the material properties in the constitutive equations of
\cite{boyce2000constitutive} to incorporate the effects of photo-oxidation on
the mechanical response of LDPE. The evolution functions are based on
chemically verified processes that are responsible for material degradation,
namely the change in crystallinity and mass loss relative to the initial
pristine films over exposure time. Changes in crystallinity and mass loss are
characterized by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Quartz Crystal
Microbalance with Dissipation Monitoring (QCM-D) experiments, respectively.
Connecting the physio-chemical processes affecting polymer network evolution to
the mechanical response of LDPE bypasses the need for defining fitting
parameters that carry no physical meaning. The developed constitutive framework
is validated with respect to a series of in-house uniaxial tensile tests
performed on LDPE aged for different UV exposure times. Comparison of the
constitutive framework versus experimental mechanical tests also confirms the
accuracy of DSC and QCM-D as rigorous techniques to monitor and characterize
degradation in LDPE films. The outcome shed light on the evolution of the
macromolecular network in LDPE under extreme photo-oxidation and the evolution

of the 6G Radio Access Network (RAN), allowing to exploit the dense cell
infrastructure of 5G for constructing a perceptive network. In this paper, we
provide a comprehensive overview on the background, range of key applications
and state-of-the-art approaches of Integrated Sensing and Communications
(ISAC). We commence by discussing the interplay between sensing and
communications (S&C) from a historical point of view, and then consider
multiple facets of ISAC and its performance gains. By introducing both ongoing
and potential use cases, we shed light on industrial progress and
standardization activities related to ISAC. We analyze a number of performance
tradeoffs between S&C, spanning from information theoretical limits, tradeoffs
in physical layer performance, to the tradeoff in cross-layer designs. Next, we
discuss signal processing aspects of ISAC, namely ISAC waveform design and
receive signal processing. As a step further, we provide our vision on the
deeper integration between S&C within the framework of perceptive networks,
where the two functionalities are expected to mutually assist each other, i.e.,
communication-assisted sensing and sensing-assisted communications. Finally, we
summarize the paper by identifying the potential integration between ISAC and
other emerging communication technologies, and their positive impact on the
future of wireless networks.

prove classification of solutions to the following conformally invariant system

use an $\exp^{L}+L\ln L$ inequality, which is itself of independent interest.

quasi-Hamiltonians, in the sense of Floquet theory, that are otherwise
inaccessible in static condensed matter systems. Although the Floquet
quasi-Hamiltonians are time-independent, however, these continuously driven
systems can still suffer from heating due to a secular growth in the
expectation value of the time-dependent physical Hamiltonian. Here we use an
exact space-time mapping to construct a class of many-body systems with rapid
periodic driving which we nonetheless prove to be completely free of heating,
by mapping them exactly onto time-independent systems. The absence of heating
despite the periodic driving occurs in these cases of harmonically trapped
dilute Bose gas because the driving is a certain periodic but anharmonic
modulation of the gas's two-body contact interaction, at a particular
frequency. Although we prove that the absence of heating is exact within full
quantum many-body theory, we then use mean-field theory to simulate 'Floquet
heating spectroscopy' and compute the heating rate when the driving frequency
is varied away from the critical value for zero heating. In both weakly and
strongly non-linear regimes, the heating rate as a function of driving
frequency appears to show a number of Fano resonances, suggesting that the
exactly proven absence of heating at the critical frequency may be explained in
terms of destructive interferences between excitation modes.

gravitational lens via lensing observations. We consider an extended, compact
gravitational lens, representing its static external gravitational potential
via an infinite set of symmetric trace free (STF) multipole moments. Within the
wave-optical treatment, we evaluate the caustics formed in the lens's point
spread function (PSF). We study the only quantity that is available in
astronomical lensing observations: the image of that PSF formed by an imaging
telescope. This observable may be used to recover some physical characteristics
of the lens, including its shape, orientation and composition. Illustrating
this, we study exotic gravitational lenses formed by several well-known solids
with uniform density. We show that when moments beyond the quadrupole are
observed, some of the symmetry properties of the lens can be recovered. The
presence of an octupole moment implies breaking the ""north-south"" symmetry of
the mass distribution in the lens. The presence of a rotated hexadecapole
moment implies breaking axial symmetry. As such, if observations of lensed
images allow the reconstruction of these moments, important information about
the mass distribution and dynamics of the lens can be obtained. This may help
with choosing the most appropriate mass profile that is used to characterize
the mass distribution of astrophysical lenses, such as the dark matter halos
that are presumed to contain most of the mass of galaxies and clusters of
galaxies. Our results are novel and offer new insight into gravitational
lensing by realistic astrophysical systems.

  Curriculum Learning: An Application to Digital Pathology","Accepted at ICCV 2021 CDpath workshop",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently shown tremendous potential to
learn generic visual representations useful for many image analysis tasks.
Despite their notable success, the existing SSL methods fail to generalize to
downstream tasks when the number of labeled training instances is small or if
the domain shift between the transfer domains is significant. In this paper, we
attempt to improve self-supervised pretrained representations through the lens
of curriculum learning by proposing a hardness-aware dynamic curriculum
learning (HaDCL) approach. To improve the robustness and generalizability of
SSL, we dynamically leverage progressive harder examples via easy-to-hard and
hard-to-very-hard samples during mini-batch downstream fine-tuning. We discover
that by progressive stage-wise curriculum learning, the pretrained
representations are significantly enhanced and adaptable to both in-domain and
out-of-domain distribution data.
  We performed extensive validation on three histology benchmark datasets on
both patch-wise and slide-level classification problems. Our curriculum based
fine-tuning yields a significant improvement over standard fine-tuning, with a
minimum improvement in area-under-the-curve (AUC) score of 1.7% and 2.2% on
in-domain and out-of-domain distribution data, respectively. Further, we
empirically show that our approach is more generic and adaptable to any SSL
methods and does not impose any additional overhead complexity. Besides, we
also outline the role of patch-based versus slide-based curriculum learning in
histopathology to provide practical insights into the success of curriculum
based fine-tuning of SSL methods. Code is released at

this leads to the unjustified primacy of an undetermined scalar field. Instead,
we propose to consider algebraic structures in which all (and only) physical
fields are primitive. We explain how the theory of \emph{natural operations} in

diffeomorphism-invariant constructions -- can be used to obtain concrete
implementations of this idea for any given collection of fields.

evaluate a collection of such models (with between 244M and 137B parameters) on
two new benchmarks, MBPP and MathQA-Python, in both the few-shot and
fine-tuning regimes. Our benchmarks are designed to measure the ability of
these models to synthesize short Python programs from natural language
descriptions. The Mostly Basic Programming Problems (MBPP) dataset contains 974
programming tasks, designed to be solvable by entry-level programmers. The
MathQA-Python dataset, a Python version of the MathQA benchmark, contains 23914
problems that evaluate the ability of the models to synthesize code from more
complex text. On both datasets, we find that synthesis performance scales
log-linearly with model size. Our largest models, even without finetuning on a
code dataset, can synthesize solutions to 59.6 percent of the problems from
MBPP using few-shot learning with a well-designed prompt. Fine-tuning on a
held-out portion of the dataset improves performance by about 10 percentage
points across most model sizes. On the MathQA-Python dataset, the largest
fine-tuned model achieves 83.8 percent accuracy. Going further, we study the
model's ability to engage in dialog about code, incorporating human feedback to
improve its solutions. We find that natural language feedback from a human
halves the error rate compared to the model's initial prediction. Additionally,
we conduct an error analysis to shed light on where these models fall short and
what types of programs are most difficult to generate. Finally, we explore the
semantic grounding of these models by fine-tuning them to predict the results

This paper proposes a novel hybrid model for automatically extracting patient

The model is based on a neural bidirectional sequence model (BiLSTM or BiGRU)
and a CNN layer for phenotypes identification. An extra CNN layer is run
parallel to the hybrid model to extract more features related to each
phenotype. We used pre-trained embeddings such as FastText and Word2vec

Experimental results using MIMIC III database in internal comparison
demonstrate that the proposed model achieved significant performance
improvement over existing models. The enhanced version of our model with an

model. We also showed that BiGRU layer with FastText embedding had better

machine learning. Prior work handles this by assuming that different levels of
quality are ""evenly spaced"" from one another. This assumption runs counter to
intuitions about the relative degrees of effort needed to raise Wikipedia
encyclopedia articles to different quality levels. Furthermore, models from
prior work are fit to datasets that oversample high-quality articles. This
limits their accuracy for representative samples of articles or revisions. I
describe a technique extending the Wikimedia Foundations' ORES article quality
model to address these limitations. My method uses weighted ordinal regression
models to construct one-dimensional continuous measures of quality. While
scores from my technique and from prior approaches are correlated, my approach
improves accuracy for research datasets and provides evidence that the ""evenly
spaced"" assumption is unfounded in practice on English Wikipedia. I conclude
with recommendations for using quality scores in future research and include
the full code, data, and models.

computer vision are streaming applications that take a sequence of inputs over
time. It is challenging to find knob settings that optimize the run-time
performance of such applications because the optimal knob settings are usually
functions of inputs, computing platforms, time as well as user's requirements,
which can be very diverse.
  Most prior works address this problem by offline profiling followed by
training models for control. However, profiling-based approaches incur large
overhead before execution; it is also difficult to redeploy them in other
run-time configurations.
  In this paper, we propose Sonic, a sampling-based online controller for
long-running streaming applications that does not require profiling ahead of
time. Within each phase of a streaming application's execution, Sonic utilizes
the beginning portion to sample the knob space strategically and aims to pick
the optimal knob setting for the rest of the phase, given a user-specified
constrained optimization problem. A hybrid approach of machine learning
regressions and Bayesian optimization are used for better overall sampling
choices.
  Sonic is implemented independent of application, device, input, performance
objective and constraints. We evaluate Sonic on traditional parallel benchmarks
as well as on deep learning inference benchmarks across multiple platforms. Our
experiments show that when using Sonic to control knob settings, application
run-time performance is only 5.3% less than if optimal knob settings were used,
demonstrating that Sonic is able to find near-optimal knob settings under
diverse run-time configurations without prior knowledge quickly.

regarding an unknown parameter in an exponential family when observations are
costly. In a Bayesian setting, the problem can be embedded in a Markovian
framework. Using the conditional probability of one of the hypotheses as the
underlying spatial variable, we show that the cost function is concave and that
the posterior distribution becomes more concentrated as time goes on. Moreover,
we study time monotonicity of the value function. For a large class of model
specifications, the cost function is non-decreasing in time, and the optimal
stopping boundaries are thus monotone.

fields of chemical and materials science with accelerated, high-efficiency
discoveries in design, synthesis, manufacturing, characterization and

The reason is the time efficiency, prediction accuracy and good generalization
abilities, which gradually replaces the traditional experimental or
computational work. With enormous potentiality to tackle more real-world
problems, ML provides a more comprehensive insight into combinations with
molecules/materials under the fundamental procedures for constructing ML
models, like predicting properties or functionalities from given parameters,
nanoarchitecture design and generating specific models for other purposes. The
key to the advances in nanomaterials discovery is how input fingerprints and
output values can be linked quantitatively. Finally, some great opportunities
and technical challenges are concluded in this fantastic field.

and easy generation of realistic synthesized images, but also an increased risk
of malicious abuse of those images. Thus, it is important to develop a
generalized detector for synthesized images of any GAN model or object
category, including those unseen during the training phase. However, the
conventional methods heavily depend on the training settings, which cause a
dramatic decline in performance when tested with unknown domains. To resolve
the issue and obtain a generalized detection ability, we propose Bilateral
High-Pass Filters (BiHPF), which amplify the effect of the frequency-level
artifacts that are known to be found in the synthesized images of generative
models. Numerous experimental results validate that our method outperforms
other state-of-the-art methods, even when tested with unseen domains.

complexity of controlling it and the caveats of current methods. In this
regard, as seen in earlier epidemics, testing has always been an integral part
of containment policy. But one has to consider the optimality of a testing
scheme based on the resultant disease spread in the community and not based on
purely increasing testing efficiency. Therefore, taking a decision is no easy
feat and must consider the community utility constrained by its priorities,
budget, risks, collateral and abilities which can be encoded into the
optimization of the strategy. We thus propose a simple pooling strategy that is
easy to customize and practical to implement, unlike other complex and
computationally intensive methods.

father. However, if a man is promiscuous then his children tend to be
(unwittingly) raised within other families; such children should fare better if
they do not resemble their father. This suggests that father-son facial
similarity should decrease as a function of male promiscuity. To test this
hypothesis, the degree of similarity between each of 37 pairs of father-son
photographs was rated by 83 participants. The promiscuity score of a father was
defined as the number of sexual relationships he had been involved in. A linear
regression of father-son similarity ratings against fathers' promiscuity scores
indicated that the slope of the fitted line was significantly less than zero
(slope=-0.176, p < 0.001), and that fathers' promiscuity scores account for 75%
of the variance father-son facial similarity ratings. Additionally, a
significant negative non-parametric correlation (Spearman's rho rho=-0.886,
p=0.019) between father-son similarity ratings and fathers' promiscuity scores
was found.
