of robotics, allowing the system itself to find a solution for a task otherwise
requiring a complex decision-making algorithm. In this paper, we present a
novel RL-based Tic-tac-toe scenario, i.e. SwarmPlay, where each playing
component is presented by an individual drone that has its own mobility and
swarm intelligence to win against a human player. Thus, the combination of
challenging swarm strategy and human-drone collaboration aims to make the games
with machines tangible and interactive. Although some research on AI for board
games already exists, e.g., chess, the SwarmPlay technology has the potential
to offer much more engagement and interaction with the user as it proposes a
multi-agent swarm instead of a single interactive robot. We explore user's
evaluation of RL-based swarm behavior in comparison with the game theory-based
behavior. The preliminary user study revealed that participants were highly
engaged in the game with drones (70% put a maximum score on the Likert scale)
and found it less artificial compared to the regular computer-based systems
(80%). The affection of the user's game perception from its outcome was
analyzed and put under discussion. User study revealed that SwarmPlay has the
potential to be implemented in a wider range of games, significantly improving
human-drone interactivity.

properties (e.g. elasticity, strength, conductivity) and their relations to
processing conditions. A major drawback is the calibration of model parameters
that depend on processing conditions. Currently, these parameters must be
optimized to fit measured data since their relations to processing conditions
(e.g. deformation temperature, strain rate) are not fully understood. We
present a new approach that identifies the functional dependency of calibration
parameters from processing conditions based on genetic programming. We propose
two (explicit and implicit) methods to identify these dependencies and generate
short interpretable expressions. The approach is used to extend a physics-based
constitutive model for deformation processes. This constitutive model operates
with internal material variables such as a dislocation density and contains a
number of parameters, among them three calibration parameters. The derived
expressions extend the constitutive model and replace the calibration
parameters. Thus, interpolation between various processing parameters is
enabled.
  Our results show that the implicit method is computationally more expensive
than the explicit approach but also produces significantly better results.

The framework can realize both local and cross-regional knowledge sharing.
Then, the framework is applied to autonomous driving applications, wherein
machine learning based models for autonomous driving control can be shared. A
lightweight tip selection algorithm (TSA) is proposed for the DAG based

enhance drivers' ability to avoid crashes. As dashboard cameras have become a
low-cost sensor device accessible to almost every vehicle, deep neural networks
for crash anticipation from a dashboard camera are receiving growing interest.
However, drivers' trust in the Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled safety
function is built on the validation of its safety enhancement toward zero
deaths. This paper is motivated to establish a method that uses gaze data and
corresponding measures to evaluate human drivers' ability to anticipate
crashes. A laboratory experiment is designed and performed, wherein a
screen-based eye tracker collects the gaze data of six volunteers while
watching 100 driving videos that include both normal and crash scenarios.
Statistical analyses of the experimental data show that, on average, drivers
can anticipate a crash up to 2.61 seconds before it occurs in this pilot study.
The chance that drivers have successfully anticipated crashes before they occur
is 92.8%. A state-of-the-art AI model can anticipate crashes 1.02 seconds
earlier than drivers on average. The study finds that crash-involving traffic
agents in the driving videos can vary drivers' instant attention level, average
attention level, and spatial attention distribution. This finding supports the
development of a spatial-temporal attention mechanism for AI models to
strengthen their ability to anticipate crashes. Results from the comparison
also suggest the development of collaborative intelligence that keeps
human-in-the-loop of AI models to further enhance the reliability of AI-enabled
safety functions.

years of observations of the Dark Energy Survey (DES Y3). This correlation is
sensitive to the thermal energy in baryons over a wide redshift range, and is
therefore a powerful probe of astrophysical feedback. We detect the correlation
at a statistical significance of $21\sigma$, the highest significance to date.
We examine the tSZ maps for potential contaminants, including cosmic infrared
background (CIB) and radio sources, finding that CIB has a substantial impact
on our measurements and must be taken into account in our analysis. We use the
cross-correlation measurements to test different feedback models. In
particular, we model the tSZ using several different pressure profile models
calibrated against hydrodynamical simulations. Our analysis marginalises over
redshift uncertainties, shear calibration biases, and intrinsic alignment
effects. We also marginalise over $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$ using ${\it
Planck}$ or DES priors. We find that the data prefers the model with a low
amplitude of the pressure profile at small scales, compatible with a scenario
with strong AGN feedback and ejection of gas from the inner part of the halos.
When using a more flexible model for the shear profile, constraints are weaker,
and the data cannot discriminate between different baryonic prescriptions.

thermal Sunyaev Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. The cross-correlation of gravitational
lensing (which traces the projected mass) with the tSZ effect (which traces the
projected gas pressure) is a powerful probe of the thermal state of ionized
baryons throughout the Universe, and is sensitive to effects such as baryonic
feedback. In a companion paper (Gatti et al. 2021), we present tomographic
measurements and validation tests of the cross-correlation between galaxy shear
measurements from the first three years of observations of the Dark Energy
Survey, and tSZ measurements from a combination of Atacama Cosmology Telescope
and ${\it Planck}$ observations. In this work, we use the same measurements to
constrain models for the pressure profiles of halos across a wide range of halo
mass and redshift. We find evidence for reduced pressure in low mass halos,
consistent with predictions for the effects of feedback from active galactic
nuclei. We infer the hydrostatic mass bias ($B \equiv M_{500c}/M_{\rm SZ}$)
from our measurements, finding $B = 1.8\pm0.1$ when adopting the ${\it
Planck}$-preferred cosmological parameters. We additionally find that our
measurements are consistent with a non-zero redshift evolution of $B$, with the
correct sign and sufficient magnitude to explain the mass bias necessary to
reconcile cluster count measurements with the ${\it Planck}$-preferred
cosmology. Our analysis introduces a model for the impact of intrinsic
alignments (IA) of galaxy shapes on the shear-tSZ correlation. We show that IA
can have a significant impact on these correlations at current noise levels.

girdles of two diatom species with various lattice constants are used as
bio-silica scaffolds for plasmonic crystals, combined with metals chosen for
spectral agreement between permittivity and photonic crystal properties. The
use of frustules as scaffolds for plasmonic application has been tested
earlier, as nano-porous features can enhance scattering and local hotspots,
useful for sensing application or SERS. However, both the use of girdles and of
continuous metal films are new approaches offering previously unseen plasmonic
effects. Angularly resolved dispersions from reflection Fourier spectroscopy
are provided for Coscinodiscus granii girdles, forming well-ordered square

covered with a 40 nm film of silver or with 40 nm of gold, respectively. These
were confirmed with optical modelling of the 3D systems, including both metal
surface layers and internal frustule structures, allowing for the calculation

structures produced via Focused Ion Beam microscopy, demonstrating the
advantages of girdles as photonic crystal scaffolds and as an alternative to
conventional plasmonic crystal fabrication. The results demonstrate that
high-quality plasmonic crystal scaffolds from diatoms are available in nature,

implications for the thermal and compositional gradients within the planet.
Recent studies have shown that planetary volatiles become ionically conducting
under conditions that are present in the ice giants. Rapidly growing electrical
conductivity with increasing depth would couple zonal flows to the background
magnetic field in the planets, inducing poloidal and toroidal field
perturbations $\mathbf{B}^{\omega} = \mathbf{B}^{\omega}_P +
\mathbf{B}^{\omega}_T$ via the $\omega$-effect. Toroidal perturbations
$\mathbf{B}^{\omega}_T$ are expected to diffuse downwards and produce poloidal
fields $\mathbf{B}^{\alpha}_P$ through turbulent convection via the
$\alpha$-effect, comparable in strength to those of the $\omega$-effect;
$\mathbf{B}^{\omega}_P$. To estimate the strength of poloidal field
perturbations for various Uranus models in the literature, we generate wind
decay profiles based on Ohmic dissipation constraints assuming an ionically
conducting H$_2$-He-H$_2$O interior. Due to the higher metallicities in outer
regions of hot Uranus models, zonal winds need to decay to $\sim$0.1% of their
surface values in the outer 1% of Uranus to admit decay solutions in the Ohmic
framework. Our estimates suggest that colder Uranus models could potentially
have poloidal field perturbations that reach up to $\mathcal{O}(0.1)$ of the
background magnetic field in the most extreme case. The possible existence of
poloidal field perturbations spatially correlated with Uranus' zonal flows
could be used to constrain Uranus' interior structure, and presents a further
case for the $\textit{in situ}$ exploration of Uranus.

intense traffic congestion. In recent years, the concept of Urban Air Mobility

this problem, and this approach has been rapidly gaining ground. This
disruptive technology involves aerial vehicles (AVs) for hire than can be
utilized by customers to travel between locations within large cities. This
concept has the potential to drastically decrease traffic congestion and reduce
air pollution, since these vehicles typically use electric motors powered by
batteries. This work studies the problem of scheduling the assignment of AVs to
customers, having as a goal to maximize the serviced customers and minimize the
energy consumption of the AVs by forcing them to fly at the lowest possible
altitude. Initially, an Integer Linear Program (ILP) formulation is presented,
that is solved offline and optimally, followed by a near-optimal algorithm,
that solves the problem incrementally, one AV at a time, to address scalability
issues, allowing scheduling in problems involving large numbers of locations,

the bandwidth of the probing pulse and the medium through which the waves

in the matrix convex setting. Matrix exposed points in finite dimensions were
first defined by Kriel in 2019. Here this notion is extended to matrix convex
sets in infinite-dimensional vector spaces. Then a connection between matrix
exposed points and matrix extreme points is established: a matrix extreme point
is ordinary exposed if and only if it is matrix exposed. This leads to a
Krein-Milman type result for matrix exposed points that is due to
Straszewicz-Klee in classical convexity: a compact matrix convex set is the
closed matrix convex hull of its matrix exposed points.
  Several notions of a fixed-level as well as a multicomponent matrix face and
matrix exposed face are introduced to extend the concepts of a matrix extreme
point and a matrix exposed point, respectively. Their properties resemble those
of (exposed) faces in the classical sense, e.g., it is shown that the
$C^\ast$-extreme (matrix extreme) points of a matrix face (matrix multiface) of
a matrix convex set $K$ are matrix extreme in $K$. As in the case of extreme
points, any fixed-level matrix face is ordinary exposed if and only if it is a
matrix exposed face. From this it follows that every fixed-level matrix face of
a free spectrahedron is matrix exposed. On the other hand, matrix multifaces
give rise to the noncommutative counterpart of the classical theory connecting
(archimedean) faces of compact convex sets and (archimedean) order ideals of
the corresponding function systems.

domain adaptation (SFDA) where only a source pre-trained model is available for
adaptation to the target domain. However, those methods do not consider keeping
source performance which is of high practical value in real world applications.
In this paper, we propose a new domain adaptation paradigm called Generalized
Source-free Domain Adaptation (G-SFDA), where the learned model needs to
perform well on both the target and source domains, with only access to current
unlabeled target data during adaptation. First, we propose local structure
clustering (LSC), aiming to cluster the target features with its semantically
similar neighbors, which successfully adapts the model to the target domain in
the absence of source data. Second, we propose sparse domain attention (SDA),
it produces a binary domain specific attention to activate different feature
channels for different domains, meanwhile the domain attention will be utilized
to regularize the gradient during adaptation to keep source information. In the
experiments, for target performance our method is on par with or better than
existing DA and SFDA methods, specifically it achieves state-of-the-art
performance (85.4%) on VisDA, and our method works well for all domains after
adapting to single or multiple target domains. Code is available in

Adding to this uncertainty is the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that has
triggered profound changes in mobility behaviors as well as accelerated
adoption of new technologies at an unprecedented rate. Accordingly, this study
examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on willingness to adopt the
emerging technology of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Using data from a survey
disseminated in June 2020 to 700 respondents in the United States, we perform a
difference-in-difference regression to analyze the shift in willingness to use
autonomous vehicles as part of a shared fleet before and during the pandemic.
The results reveal that the COVID-19 pandemic has a positive and highly
significant impact on the consideration of using autonomous vehicles. This
shift is present regardless of tech-savviness, gender or urban/rural household
location. Individuals who are younger, left-leaning and frequent users of
shared modes of travel are expected to become more likely to use autonomous
vehicles once offered. Understanding the effects of these attributes on the
increase in consideration of AVs is important for policy making, as these
effects provide a guide to predicting adoption of autonomous vehicles - once
available - and to identify segments of the population likely to be more
resistant to adopting AVs.

reconstruct a high quality sRGB image from the raw sensor data. These steps
consist of demosaicing, denoising, white balancing, gamma correction, colour
enhancement, etc. Since each of them are performed sequentially using
hand-crafted algorithms, the residual error from each processing module
accumulates in the final reconstructed signal. Thus, the traditional ISP
pipeline has limited reconstruction quality in terms of generalizability across
different lighting conditions and associated noise levels while capturing the
image. Deep learning methods using convolutional neural networks (CNN) have
become popular in solving many image-related tasks such as image denoising,

that are connected with compromised substations. For our game formulation, we
propose a double oracle algorithm based approach that solves the best response
for each player. We show that the best responses for the grid operator and
adversary can be formulated as mixed integer linear programs. In addition, the
best response of the adversary is equivalent to a submodular maximization
problem under a cardinality constraint, which can be approximated up to a
$(1-\frac{1}{e})$ optimality bound in polynomial time. We compare the proposed
approach with a baseline where the grid operator computes an islanding strategy
by minimizing the power flow disruption without considering the possible
response from the adversary. We evaluate both approaches using IEEE 9-bus,
14-bus, 30-bus, 39-bus, 57-bus, and 118-bus power system case study data. Our
proposed approach achieves better performance than the baseline in about $44\%$
of test cases, and on average it incurs about 12.27 MW less power flow
disruption.

  admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2006.11798, arXiv:2010.05999",,,,"math.CO cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In 1943, Hadwiger conjectured that every graph with no $K_t$ minor is
$(t-1)$-colorable for every $t\ge 1$. In the 1980s, Kostochka and Thomason
independently proved that every graph with no $K_t$ minor has average degree
$O(t\sqrt{\log t})$ and hence is $O(t\sqrt{\log t})$-colorable. Recently,
Norin, Song and the second author showed that every graph with no $K_t$ minor
is $O(t(\log t)^{\beta})$-colorable for every $\beta > 1/4$, making the first
improvement on the order of magnitude of the $O(t\sqrt{\log t})$ bound. The
first main result of this paper is that every graph with no $K_t$ minor is
$O(t\log\log t)$-colorable.
  This is a corollary of our main technical result that the chromatic number of
a $K_t$-minor-free graph is bounded by $O(t(1+f(G,t)))$ where $f(G,t)$ is the
maximum of $\frac{\chi(H)}{a}$ over all $a\ge \frac{t}{\sqrt{\log t}}$ and
$K_a$-minor-free subgraphs $H$ of $G$ that are small (i.e. $O(a\log^4 a)$
vertices). This has a number of interesting corollaries. First as mentioned,
using the current best-known bounds on coloring small $K_t$-minor-free graphs,
we show that $K_t$-minor-free graphs are $O(t\log\log t)$-colorable. Second, it
shows that proving Linear Hadwiger's Conjecture (that $K_t$-minor-free graphs
are $O(t)$-colorable) reduces to proving it for small graphs. Third, we prove
that $K_t$-minor-free graphs with clique number at most $\sqrt{\log t}/ (\log
\log t)^2$ are $O(t)$-colorable. This implies our final corollary that Linear
Hadwiger's Conjecture holds for $K_r$-free graphs for every fixed $r$.
  One key to proving the main theorem is a new standalone result that every
$K_t$-minor-free graph of average degree $d=\Omega(t)$ has a subgraph on $O(t
\log^3 t)$ vertices with average degree $\Omega(d)$.

Towards this goal, we highlight the role that a certain square matrix that

construction of codes with graphs of desired girth and further explore it in
order to generate the set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a Tanner
graph to have a given girth between 6 and 12. For each such girth, we present
algorithms to construct codes of the desired girth and we show how to use them
to compute the minimum necessary value of the lifting factor. For girth larger
than 12, we show how to use multi-step graph lifting methods to
deterministically modify codes in order to increase their girth. We also give a
new perspective on LDPC protograph-based parity-check matrices by viewing them
as rows of a parity-check matrix equal to the sum of certain permutation
matrices and obtain an important connection between all protographs and those
with variable nodes of degree 2. We also show that the results and methodology

47 Tuc. We have analyzed observations obtained with the Far Ultraviolet
Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE), the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) aboard the
Hubble Space Telescope, and the MIKE Spectrograph on the Magellan Telescope. By
fitting these data with synthetic spectra, we determine various stellar
parameters (T_eff = 10,850 +/- 250 K, log g = 2.20 +/- 0.13) and the
photospheric abundances of 26 elements, including Ne, P, Cl, Ga, Pd, In, Sn,
Hg, and Pb, which have not previously been published for this cluster.
Abundances of intermediate-mass elements (Mg through Ga) generally scale with
Fe, while the heaviest elements (Pd through Pb) have roughly solar abundances.
Its low C/O ratio indicates that the star did not undergo third dredge-up and
suggests that its heavy elements were made by a previous generation of stars.
If so, this pattern should be present throughout the cluster, not just in this
star. Stellar-evolution models suggest that the Bright Star is powered by a
He-burning shell, having left the AGB during or immediately after a thermal
pulse. Its mass (0.54 +/- 0.16 M_sun) implies that single stars in 47 Tuc lose
0.1--0.2 M_sun on the AGB, only slightly less than they lose on the RGB.

ProgTr works, the proposed scheme was simulated in different scenarios

which find widespread use because of their ability to synthesize data from
complex, high-dimensional manifolds. However, even with their increasing
industrial adoption, they haven't been subject to rigorous security and privacy
analysis. In this work we examine one such aspect, namely backdoor attacks on
DGMs which can significantly limit the applicability of pre-trained models
within a model supply chain and at the very least cause massive reputation
damage for companies outsourcing DGMs form third parties.
  While similar attacks scenarios have been studied in the context of classical
prediction models, their manifestation in DGMs hasn't received the same
attention. To this end we propose novel training-time attacks which result in
corrupted DGMs that synthesize regular data under normal operations and
designated target outputs for inputs sampled from a trigger distribution. These
attacks are based on an adversarial loss function that combines the dual
objectives of attack stealth and fidelity. We systematically analyze these
attacks, and show their effectiveness for a variety of approaches like
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), as
well as different data domains including images and audio. Our experiments show
that - even for large-scale industry-grade DGMs (like StyleGAN) - our attacks
can be mounted with only modest computational effort. We also motivate suitable
defenses based on static/dynamic model and output inspections, demonstrate
their usefulness, and prescribe a practical and comprehensive defense strategy
that paves the way for safe usage of DGMs.

that enables fault-tolerance using a total of seven qubits. We encode the
logical qubit using a novel protocol based on repeated multi-qubit measurements
and show that it outperforms non-fault-tolerant encoding schemes. We then
fault-tolerantly manipulate the logical qubit through a complete set of
single-qubit Clifford gates. Finally, we demonstrate flagged stabilizer
measurements with real-time processing of the outcomes. Such measurements are a
primitive for fault-tolerant quantum error correction. While future
improvements in fidelity and the number of qubits will be required, our
realization of fault-tolerant protocols on the logical-qubit level is a key
step towards large-scale quantum information processing based on solid-state
spins.

different color exceeds some threshold. Simulations reveal that even such mild
local color preferences, or homophily, are sufficient to cause segregation. In
this work, we propose a stochastic generalization of the Schelling model, based
on both race and wealth, to understand how carefully architected placement of
incentives, such as urban infrastructure, might affect segregation. In our
model, each agent is assigned one of two colors along with a label, rich or
poor. Further, we designate certain vertices on the lattice as ""urban sites,""
providing civic infrastructure that most benefits the poorer population, thus
incentivizing the occupation of such vertices by poor agents of either color.
We look at the stationary distribution of a Markov process reflecting these
preferences to understand the long-term effects. We prove that when incentives
are large enough, we will have ""urbanization of poverty,"" an observed effect
whereby poor people tend to congregate on urban sites. Moreover, even when
homophily preferences are very small, if the incentives are large and there is
income inequality in the two-color classes, we can get racial segregation on
urban sites but integration on non-urban sites. In contrast, we find overall
mitigation of segregation when the urban sites are distributed throughout the
lattice and the incentives for urban sites exceed the homophily biases. We
prove that in this case, no matter how strong homophily preferences are, it
will be exponentially unlikely that a configuration chosen from stationarity
will have large, homogeneous clusters of agents of either color, suggesting we
will have racial integration with high probability.

underdevelopment for the young group. Deep learning methods have achieved the
state-of-the-art performance in many medical image analysis tasks, including
brain age estimation. However, the performance and generalisability of the deep
learning model are highly dependent on the quantity and quality of the training
data set. Both collecting and annotating brain MRI data are extremely
time-consuming. In this paper, to overcome the data scarcity problem, we
propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) based image synthesis method.
Different from the existing GAN-based methods, we integrate a task-guided
branch (a regression model for age estimation) to the end of the generator in
GAN. By adding a task-guided loss to the conventional GAN loss, the learned
low-dimensional latent space and the synthesised images are more task-specific.
It helps to boost the performance of the down-stream task by combining the
synthesised images and real images for model training. The proposed method was
evaluated on a public brain MRI data set for age estimation. Our proposed
method outperformed (statistically significant) a deep convolutional neural
network based regression model and the GAN-based image synthesis method without
the task-guided branch. More importantly, it enables the identification of
age-related brain regions in the image space. The code is available on GitHub

Specifically, the adaptive graph wavelets are learned with neural
network-parameterized lifting structures, where structure-aware attention-based
lifting operations (i.e., prediction and update operations) are developed to
jointly consider graph structures and node features. We propose to lift based
on diffusion wavelets to alleviate the structural information loss induced by
partitioning non-bipartite graphs. By design, the locality and sparsity of the
resulting wavelet transform as well as the scalability of the lifting structure
are guaranteed. We further derive a soft-thresholding filtering operation by
learning sparse graph representations in terms of the learned wavelets,
yielding a localized, efficient, and scalable wavelet-based graph filters. To
ensure that the learned graph representations are invariant to node
permutations, a layer is employed at the input of the networks to reorder the
nodes according to their local topology information. We evaluate the proposed

paper, we derive an optimal multi-frequency combination to jointly minimize CMB
lensing noise and bias. We focus on the standard lensing quadratic estimator,
as well as the ""shear-only"" and source-hardened estimators, whose responses to
foregrounds differ. We show that an optimal multi-frequency combination is a
compromise between the ILC and joint deprojection, which nulls the thermal
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) and Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB) contributions. In
particular, for a Simons Observatory-like experiment with
$\ell_{\text{max},T}=3000$, we find that profile hardening alone (with the
standard ILC) reduces the bias to the lensing power amplitude by $40\%$, at a
$20\%$ cost in noise, while the bias to the cross-correlation with a LSST-like
sample is reduced by nearly an order of magnitude at a $10\%$ noise cost,
relative to the standard quadratic estimator. With a small amount of joint
deprojection the bias to the profile hardened estimator can be further reduced
to less than half the statistical uncertainty on the respective amplitudes, at
a $20\%$ and $5\%$ noise cost for the auto- and cross-correlation respectively,
relative to the profile hardened estimator with the standard ILC weights.
Finally, we explore possible improvements with more aggressive masking and

discussed. Due to the high dimensionality of the 4PCF, data compression is
required; we use a signal-to-noise-based scheme calibrated from theoretical
covariance matrices to restrict to $\sim$ $100$ basis vectors. The compression
has minimal impact on the detection significance and facilitates traditional
$\chi^2$-like analyses using a suite of mock catalogs. The significance is
stable with respect to different treatments of noise in the sample covariance
(arising from the limited number of mocks), but decreases to $4.7\sigma$ when a
minimum galaxy separation of $14 h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ is enforced on the 4PCF
tetrahedra (such that the statistic can be modelled more easily). The
detectability of the 4PCF in the quasi-linear regime implies that it will

feedback in those galaxies, we construct a semianalytical model of gas
circulation. This model especially focuses on the massive molecular gas
(interstellar cold gas on a scale of ~ 10 kpc) and the circumnuclear disk (~<
0.5 kpc). We consider the destruction of the interstellar cold gas by star
formation and the gravitational instability for the circumnuclear disk. Our
model can reproduce the basic properties of the interstellar cold gas and the
circumnuclear disk, such as their masses. We also find that the circumnuclear
disk tends to stay at the boundary between stable and unstable states. This
works as an 'adjusting valve' that regulates mass accretion toward the
supermassive black hole. On the other hand, the interstellar cold gas serves as
a 'fuel tank' in the AGN feedback. Even if the cooling of the galactic hot gas
is prevented, the interstellar cold gas can sustain the AGN activity for ~> 0.5
Gyr. We also confirm that the small entropy of the hot gas (~< 30 keV cm^2) or
the short cooling time (~< 1 Gyr) is a critical condition for the existence of
the massive amounts of molecular gas in the galaxy. The dissipation time of the
interstellar cold gas may be related to the critical cooling time. The galaxy
behavior is described by a simple relation among the disk stability, the cloud
dissipation time, and the gas cooling rate.

both members in an unresolved quasar pair, supplemented by sub-arcsec pairs
already resolved by Gaia DR2. We find an overall high fraction of HST-resolved

likely physical quasar pairs or gravitationally lensed quasars. We also
discover a triple quasar candidate and a quadruply lensed quasar, which is
among the smallest-separation quadruple lenses. These results provide important

final state hadrons to maximize their sensitivity, with applications ranging
from the use of tracking information (electric charge) for precision jet
substructure measurements, to flavor tagging for nucleon structure studies. For
such measurements, perturbative calculations in terms of quarks and gluons are
insufficient, and non-perturbative track functions describing the energy
fraction of a quark or gluon converted into a subset of hadrons (e.g., charged
hadrons) must be incorporated. Unlike fragmentation functions, track functions
describe correlations between hadrons and therefore satisfy complicated
non-linear evolution equations whose structure has so far eluded calculation
beyond the leading order. In this Letter, we develop an understanding of track
functions and their interplay with energy flow observables beyond the leading
order, allowing them to be used in state-of-the-art perturbative calculations
for the first time. We identify a shift symmetry in the evolution of their
moments that fixes their structure, and we explicitly compute the evolution of
the first three moments at next-to-leading order, allowing for the description
of up to three-point energy correlations. We then calculate the two-point
energy correlator on charged particles at $O(\alpha_s^2)$, illustrating
explicitly that infrared singularities in perturbation theory are absorbed by
moments of the track functions and also highlighting how these moments
seamlessly interplay with modern techniques for perturbative calculations. Our
results extend the boundaries of traditional perturbative QCD, enabling
precision perturbative predictions for energy flow observables sensitive to the
quantum numbers of hadronic states.

homogeneous limit supports a nontrivial steady state, and away from this limit
this state gives rise to a slow logarithmic growth of the decay rate (spectral

triggers the effect of higher derivative operators in the effective theory,

the (beyond) Horndeski theory, hence the name of the compact objects. Moreover,
a remnant of the galileon non-renormalization theorem guarantees that the
existence and properties of these solutions are not affected by quantum

study the set of train track points for ${\mathcal G}$-irreducible
automorphisms $\phi$ with exponential growth (relatively to ${\mathcal G}$).
Such set is known to coincide with the minimally displaced set
$\operatorname{Min}(\phi)$ of $\phi$.
  Our main result is that $\operatorname{Min}(\phi)$ is co-compact, under the
action of the cyclic subgroup generated by $\phi$.
  Along the way we obtain other results that could be of independent interest.
For instance, we prove that any point of $\operatorname{Min}(\phi)$ is in
uniform distance from $\operatorname{Min}(\phi^{-1})$. We also prove that the
action of $G$ on the product of the attracting and the repelling trees for
$\phi$, is discrete. Finally, we get some fine insight about the local topology
of relative outer space.
  As an application, we generalise a classical result of Bestvina, Feighn and
Handel for the centralisers of irreducible automorphisms of free groups, in the
more general context of relatively irreducible automorphisms of a free product.
We also deduce that centralisers of elements of $\operatorname{Out}(F_3)$ are
finitely generated, which was previously unknown. Finally, we mention that an
immediate corollary of co-compactness is that $\operatorname{Min}(\phi)$ is
quasi-isometric to a line.

introduced to fundamental computer vision tasks recently. As a typical example,
the Vision Transformer (ViT) directly applies a pure transformer architecture
on image classification, by simply splitting images into tokens with a fixed
length, and employing transformers to learn relations between these tokens.
However, such naive tokenization could destruct object structures, assign grids
to uninterested regions such as background, and introduce interference signals.
To mitigate the above issues, in this paper, we propose an iterative and
progressive sampling strategy to locate discriminative regions. At each
iteration, embeddings of the current sampling step are fed into a transformer
encoder layer, and a group of sampling offsets is predicted to update the
sampling locations for the next step. The progressive sampling is
differentiable. When combined with the Vision Transformer, the obtained PS-ViT
network can adaptively learn where to look. The proposed PS-ViT is both
effective and efficient. When trained from scratch on ImageNet, PS-ViT performs
3.8% higher than the vanilla ViT in terms of top-1 accuracy with about

now, our understanding of their collective behavior largely comes from the
study of minimal models that coarse-grain the relevant biophysics and the
hydrodynamics of slender structures. Here we build on a detailed biophysical
model to elucidate the emergence of metachronal waves on millimeter scales from
nanometer scale motor activity inside individual cilia. Our study of a 1D
lattice of cilia in the presence of hydrodynamic and steric interactions
reveals how metachronal waves are formed and maintained. We find that in
homogeneous beds of cilia these interactions lead to multiple attracting
states, all of which are characterized by an integer charge that is conserved.
This even allows us to design initial conditions that lead to predictable
emergent states. Finally, and very importantly, we show that in nonuniform

measurements proposed at the EIC, which is to obtain the spatial gluon density
distribution within a lead ($Pb$) nucleus. The proposed experimental process is
the exclusive $J/\psi$ vector-meson production off the $Pb$ nucleus -
$e+Pb\rightarrow e'+J/\psi+Pb'$. The Fourier transformation of the momentum
transfer $|t|$ distribution of the coherent diffraction is the transverse gluon
spatial distribution. In order to measure it, the experiment has to overcome an
overwhelmingly large background arising from the incoherent diffractive
production, where the nucleus $Pb'$ mostly breaks up into fragments of
particles in the far-forward direction close to the hadron-going beam rapidity.
In this paper, we systematically study the rejection of incoherent $J/\psi$
production by vetoing products from these nuclear breakups - protons, neutrons,

up-to-date EIC Far-forward Interaction Region design. The achieved vetoing

such dense system arising from both the parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs. The
proposed preconditioner is a low-rank perturbation of the original matrix and
has two advantages. First, we show that the eigenvalues of the preconditioned
system are highly clustered with some uniform bounds which are independent of
the mesh parameters. Second, the preconditioner can be used parallel for all
the Sinc time points via a block diagonalization procedure. Such a parallel
potential owes to the fact that the eigenvector matrix of the diagonalization
is well conditioned. In particular, we show that the condition number of the
eigenvector matrix only mildly grows as the number of Sinc time points
increases, and thus the roundoff error arising from the diagonalization
procedure is controllable. The effectiveness of our proposed PinT
preconditioners is verified by the observed mesh-independent convergence rates

problem in clinical practice and clinical studies. A novel approach for dealing
with missing data are Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs), which have been
generating huge research interest in image generation and transformation.
Recently, researchers have attempted to apply GANs to missing data generation
and imputation for EHR data: a major challenge here is the categorical nature
of the data. State-of-the-art solutions to the GAN-based generation of
categorical data involve either reinforcement learning, or learning a
bidirectional mapping between the categorical and the real latent feature
space, so that the GANs only need to generate real-valued features. However,
these methods are designed to generate complete feature vectors instead of
imputing only the subsets of missing features. In this paper we propose a
simple and yet effective approach that is based on previous work on GANs for
data imputation. We first motivate our solution by discussing the reason why
adversarial training often fails in case of categorical features. Then we
derive a novel way to re-code the categorical features to stabilize the
adversarial training. Based on experiments on two real-world EHR data with
multiple settings, we show that our imputation approach largely improves the
prediction accuracy, compared to more traditional data imputation approaches.

In such systems, an intrabinary shock can form as a site of particle

our new multizone code which models the X-ray and gamma-ray synchrotron and
inverse Compton spectral components for select spider binaries, including

account for the effect of electromigration on CP with minimal effort. Thirdly,
we use our theory to quantify the effect of electromigration on ion CP in
different dominant salt solutions. Finally, by analyzing two environmental

topological phase unattainable for equilibrium systems, termed the Anomalous
Floquet-Anderson insulator (AFAI). The AFAI features a quasi-energy spectrum
with chiral edge modes and a fully localized bulk, leading to non-adiabatic but
quantized charge pumping. Here, we show how such a Floquet phase can be
realized in a driven, disordered Quantum Anomalous Hall insulator, which is
assumed to have two critical energies where the localization length diverges,
carrying states with opposite Chern numbers. Driving the system at a frequency
close to resonance between these two energies localizes the critical states and
annihilates the Chern bands, giving rise to an AFAI phase. We exemplify this
principle by studying a model for a driven, magnetically doped topological
insulator film, where the annihilation of the Chern bands and the formation of
the AFAI phase is demonstrated using the rotating wave approximation. This is
complemented by a scaling analysis of the localization length for two copies of
a quantum Hall network model with a tunable coupling between them. We find that
by tuning the frequency of the driving close to resonance, the driving strength
required to stabilize the AFAI phase can be made arbitrarily small.

tridiagonal time discretization matrix. Instead of solving the corresponding
all-at-once system iteratively, we diagonalize the time discretization matrix,
which yields a direct parallel implementation across all time levels. A crucial
issue on this methodology is how the condition number of the eigenvector matrix
$V$ grows as $n$ is increased, where $n$ is the number of time levels. A large
condition number leads to large roundoff error in the diagonalization
procedure, which could seriously pollute the numerical accuracy. Based on a
novel connection between the characteristic equation and the Chebyshev
polynomials, we present explicit formulas for computing $V$ and $V^{-1}$, by
which we prove that $\mathrm{Cond}_2(V)=\mathcal{O}(n^{2})$. This implies that
the diagonalization process is well-conditioned and the roundoff error only
increases moderately as $n$ grows and thus, compared to other direct PinT
algorithms, a much larger $n$ can be used to yield satisfactory parallelism.
Numerical results on parallel machine are given to support our findings, where

generically manifest universality. In contrast, limited knowledge has been
gained on possible universal characteristics in the non-equilibrium evolution
of systems in quantum critical phases. In this context, universality is
generically attributed to the insensitivity of observables to the microscopic
system parameters and initial conditions. Here, we present such a universal
feature in the equilibration dynamics of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK)
Hamiltonian -- a paradigmatic system of disordered, all-to-all interacting
fermions that has been designed as a phenomenological description of quantum
critical regions. We drive the system far away from equilibrium by performing a
global quench, and track how its ensemble average relaxes to a steady state.
Employing state-of-the-art numerical simulations for the exact evolution, we
reveal that the disorder-averaged evolution of few-body observables, including
the quantum Fisher information and low-order moments of local operators,
exhibit within numerical resolution a universal equilibration process. Under a
straightforward rescaling, data that correspond to different initial states
collapse onto a universal curve, which can be well approximated by a Gaussian
throughout large parts of the evolution. To reveal the physics behind this
process, we formulate a general theoretical framework based on the
Novikov--Furutsu theorem. This framework extracts the disorder-averaged
dynamics of a many-body system as an effective dissipative evolution, and can
have applications beyond this work. The exact non-Markovian evolution of the
SYK ensemble is very well captured by Bourret--Markov approximations, which
contrary to common lore become justified thanks to the extreme chaoticity of
the system, and universality is revealed in a spectral analysis of the
corresponding Liouvillian.

filamentary structures present in the edge plasma. The waves are reflected,
refracted, and diffracted, leading to a decrease in efficiency of heating
and/or current generation. The scattering of RF waves (lower hybrid, helicon,
and ion cyclotron waves) by a single cylindrical filament is studied using a
full-wave analytical theory. Analysis reveals a variety of common scattering
features among the three different RF waves which can be inferred by examining
the cold plasma dispersion relation. The physical intuition is useful in
understanding experimental observations and results from complex numerical
simulations. While a filament can affect the propagation of RF waves, the
radiation force exerted by the waves can influence the filament. The force on a
filament is determined using the Maxwell stress tensor. In 1905, Poynting was
the first to evaluate and measure the radiation force on an interface
separating two different dielectric media. For ordinary light propagating in
vacuum and incident on a glass surface, Poynting noted that the surface is
""pulled"" towards the vacuum. In a magnetized cold plasma, there are two
independent wave modes. Even if only one of these modes is excited by a RF
antenna, a filament will couple power to the other mode, a consequence of
boundary conditions. This facet of scattering has consequences on the radiation
force that go beyond Poynting's seminal contribution. The direction of the
force depends on the polarization of the incident wave and on the mode
structure of the waves inside and in the vicinity of a filament. It can either
pull a filament towards the RF source or push it away. For all three waves, the
force is large enough to impact the motion of a filament and could be measured
experimentally. It may be possible to modify edge turbulence using RF waves.

Here we propose a methodology based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) for

possible. Leveraging knowledge derived from theoretical and computational
accounts of incentive salience attribution we designed an ANN for estimating
duration and intensity of future interactions between individuals and a series

found video games to be the ideal context for developing such methodology due

many existing transformations, such as Jordan-Wigner, Bravyi-Kitaev, and parity

Multilayer Segmented Parity (MSP) transformation is proposed. The MSP
transformation is a general mapping with an adjustable parameter vector, which
can be viewed as a generalization of the above-mentioned mappings. Furthermore,
the MSP transformation can adjust flexibly when dealing with different systems.
Applying these mappings to the electronic structure Hamiltonians of various

is often known as single-photon entangled and its nonlocal properties have been
the subject of intense debates in the quantum optics and foundations
communities. It is however clear that a standard Bell test made only of passive
optical elements cannot reveal the nonlocality of this state. We show that the
nonlocality of single-photon entangled states can nevertheless be revealed in a
quantum network made only of beamsplitters and photodetectors. In our protocol,
three single-photon entangled states are distributed in a triangle network,
introducing indeterminacy in the photons' paths and creating nonlocal
correlations without the need for measurements choices. We discuss a concrete
experimental realisation and provide numerical evidence of the tolerance of our
protocol to standard noise sources. Our results show that single-photon
entanglement may constitute a promising solution to generate genuine
network-nonlocal correlations useful for Bell-based quantum information

internal energy show an abrupt but continuous jump, whereas quantities
associated with second derivatives of the free energy like the specific heat
exhibit a strong sharp peak, quite similar to a second order phase transition.
We also investigate magnetization patterns and do not find evidence of

can induce a magnetization which resembles a spontaneous magnetization at a

be vulnerable to defects of some important properties such as robustness and
security. This tutorial is based on a stream of research conducted since the
summer of 2018 at a few UK universities, including the University of Liverpool,
University of Oxford, Queen's University Belfast, University of Lancaster,
University of Loughborough, and University of Exeter.
  The research aims to adapt software engineering methods, in particular
software testing methods, to work with machine learning models. Software
testing techniques have been successful in identifying software bugs, and
helping software developers in validating the software they design and
implement. It is for this reason that a few software testing techniques -- such
as the MC/DC coverage metric -- have been mandated in industrial standards for
safety critical systems, including the ISO26262 for automotive systems and the
RTCA DO-178B/C for avionics systems. However, these techniques cannot be
directly applied to machine learning models, because the latter are drastically
different from traditional software, and their design follows a completely
different development life-cycle.
  As the outcome of this thread of research, the team has developed a series of
methods that adapt the software testing techniques to work with a few classes
of machine learning models. The latter notably include convolutional neural
networks, recurrent neural networks, and random forest. The tools developed
from this research are now collected, and publicly released, in a GitHub
repository: \url{https://github.com/TrustAI/DeepConcolic}, with the BSD
3-Clause licence.
  This tutorial is to go through the major functionalities of the tools with a
few running examples, to exhibit how the developed techniques work, what the
results are, and how to interpret them.

sufficient condition to guarantee exact recovery under deterministic forward

validated in a pilot study on subjects with physiological hand tremor. The
processed data sets are suitable for machine learning to classify motor tasks.

GMCs, i.e., an emission significantly larger than what is expected from the
average Galactic cosmic rays illuminating the cloud, can imply a variation in
the local cosmic ray density, due to, for example, the presence of a recent

\cite{DBLP:conf/soda/AugustineHKSS20} in order to characterize from an
algorithmic standpoint the capabilities of networks which combine multiple
communication modes. Concretely, it is assumed that the standard $\local$ model
of distributed computing is enhanced with the feature of all-to-all
communication, but with very limited bandwidth, captured by the
node-capacitated clique ($\ncc$). In this work we provide several new insights
on the power of hybrid networks for fundamental problems in distributed
algorithms.
  First, we present a deterministic algorithm which solves any problem on a
sparse $n$-node graph in $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{n})$ rounds of
$\hybrid$. We combine this primitive with several sparsification techniques to
obtain efficient distributed algorithms for general graphs. Most notably, for
the all-pairs shortest paths problem we give deterministic $(1 + \epsilon)$-
and $\log n/\log \log n$-approximate algorithms for unweighted and weighted
graphs respectively with round complexity $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{n})$
in $\hybrid$, closely matching the performance of the state of the art
randomized algorithm of Kuhn and Schneider \cite{10.1145/3382734.3405719}.
Moreover, we make a connection with the Ghaffari-Haeupler framework of
low-congestion shortcuts \cite{DBLP:conf/soda/GhaffariH16}, leading -- among
others -- to a $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximate algorithm for Min-Cut after
$\log^{\mathcal{O}(1)}n$ rounds, with high probability, even if we restrict
local edges to transfer $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$-bits per round. Finally, we prove
via a reduction from the set disjointness problem that
$\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{1/3})$ rounds are required to determine the radius of an
unweighted graph, as well as a $(3/2 - \epsilon)$-approximation for weighted
graphs.

than 60-year old history of thick-target ISOL mass-separation facilities like
ISOLDE, the extraction of the most refractory elements as radioactive ion beam
has so far not been successful. In ordinary thick ISOL targets, their
radioisotopes produced in the target are stopped within the condensed target
material and have to diffuse through a solid material. Here, we present a
concept which overcomes limitations associated with this method. We exploit the
recoil momentum of nuclear reaction products for their release from the solid
target material. They are thermalized in a carbon monoxide-containing
atmosphere, in which volatile carbonyl complexes form readily at ambient
temperature and pressure. This compound serves as volatile carrier for
transport to the ion source. Excess carbon monoxide is removed by cryogenic gas
separation to enable low pressures in the source region, in which the species
are ionized and hence made available for radioactive ion beam formation. The
setup is operated in batch mode, with the aim to extract isotopes having
half-lives of at least several seconds. We report parameter studies of the key
processes of the method, which validate this concept and which define the
parameters for the setup. This would allow for the first time the extraction of

preferences by having respondents choose between different alternatives. Choice
experiments involving mixtures of ingredients have been largely overlooked in
the literature, even though many products and services can be described as
mixtures of ingredients. As a consequence, little research has been done on the
optimal design of choice experiments involving mixtures. The only existing
research has focused on D-optimal designs, which means that an estimation-based
approach was adopted. However, in experiments with mixtures, it is crucial to
obtain models that yield precise predictions for any combination of ingredient
proportions. This is because the goal of mixture experiments generally is to
find the mixture that optimizes the respondents' utility. As a result, the
I-optimality criterion is more suitable for designing choice experiments with
mixtures than the D-optimality criterion because the I-optimality criterion
focuses on getting precise predictions with the estimated statistical model. In
this paper, we study Bayesian I-optimal designs, compare them with their
Bayesian D-optimal counterparts, and show that the former designs perform
substantially better than the latter in terms of the variance of the predicted

one quarter of these are labeled as radio-quiet. In the population of
nonrecycled gamma-ray pulsars, the fraction of radio-quiet pulsars is higher,
about one half. Most radio observations of gamma-ray pulsars have been
performed at frequencies between 300 MHz and 2 GHz. However, pulsar radio
fluxes increase rapidly with decreasing frequency, and their radio beams often
broaden at low frequencies. As a consequence, some of these pulsars might be
detectable at low radio frequencies even when no radio flux is detected above
300 MHz. Our aim is to test this hypothesis with low-frequency radio
observations. We have observed 27 Fermi-discovered gamma-ray pulsars with the
international LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) station FR606 in single-station mode.
We used the LOFAR high band antenna (HBA) band (110-190 MHz). On average, we
use 9 h of observation per target after the removal of affected datasets,
resulting in a sensitivity for pulse-averaged flux on the order of 1-10 mJy. We
do not detect radio pulsations from any of the 27 sources, and we establish
stringent upper limits on their low-frequency radio fluxes. These nondetections
are compatible with the upper limits derived from radio observations at other
frequencies. We also determine the pulsars' geometry from the gamma-ray
profiles to see for which pulsars the low-frequency radio beam is expected to
cross Earth. This set of observations provides the most constraining upper
limits on the flux density at 150 MHz for 27 radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsars. In
spite of the beam-widening expected at low radio frequencies, most of our
nondetections can be explained by an unfavorable viewing geometry; for the
remaining observations, especially those of pulsars detected at higher
frequencies, the nondetection is compatible with insufficient sensitivity.

they can be transformed efficiently under affine maps, and allow conservative
approximation of Minkowski sums, which let one incorporate uncertainty and
linearization error in a dynamical system by expanding the size of the
reachable set. Zonotopes, a type of symmetric, convex polytope, are similarly
frequently used due to efficient numerical implementation of affine maps and
exact Minkowski sums. Both of these representations also enable efficient,
convex collision detection for fault detection or formal verification tasks,
wherein one checks if the reachable set of a system collides (i.e., intersects)
with an unsafe set. However, both representations often result in conservative
representations for reachable sets of arbitrary systems, and neither is closed
under intersection. Recently, representations such as constrained zonotopes and
constrained polynomial zonotopes have been shown to overcome some of these
conservativeness challenges, and are closed under intersection. However,
constrained zonotopes can not represent shapes with smooth boundaries such as
ellipsoids, and constrained polynomial zonotopes can require solving a
non-convex program for collision checking or fault detection. This paper
introduces ellipsotopes, a set representation that is closed under affine maps,
Minkowski sums, and intersections. Ellipsotopes combine the advantages of
ellipsoids and zonotopes while ensuring convex collision checking. The utility
of this representation is demonstrated on several examples.

the performance of Jacobi and Chebyshev smoothing for two-grid schemes with

analyzed, in both the number of species and the number of genetic loci. Here we
provide a theoretical pointer to more efficient methods, by showing that logDet
distances computed from genomic-scale sequences retain sufficient information
to recover network relationships in the level-1 ultrametric case. This result
is obtained under the Network Multispecies Coalescent model combined with a
mixture of General Time-Reversible sequence evolution models across individual
gene trees, but does not depend on partitioning sequences by genes. Thus under
standard stochastic models statistically justifiable inference of network
relationships from sequences can be accomplished without consideration of
individual genes or gene trees.

polynomial unchanged by the action is called an invariant polynomial. A famous
result of Noether states that in characteristic zero the maximal degree of a
minimal invariant polynomial is bounded above by the order of the group. Our
work establishes that the same bound holds for invariant skew polynomials in
the exterior algebra. Our approach to the problem relies on a theorem of
Derksen that connects invariant theory to the study of ideals of subspace

Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of intersections of linear ideals in the
exterior algebra. We prove the required regularity bound using tools from
representation theory. In particular, the proof relies on the existence of a

ideals of subspace arrangements over the polynomial ring to resolutions of

  Performance Criteria","accepted by IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology (April
  2023)",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The standard approach to risk-averse control is to use the Exponential
Utility (EU) functional, which has been studied for several decades. Like other
risk-averse utility functionals, EU encodes risk aversion through an increasing
convex mapping $\varphi$ of objective costs to subjective costs. An objective
cost is a realization $y$ of a random variable $Y$. In contrast, a subjective
cost is a realization $\varphi(y)$ of a random variable $\varphi(Y)$ that has
been transformed to measure preferences about the outcomes. For EU, the
transformation is $\varphi(y) = \exp(\frac{-\theta}{2}y)$, and under certain
conditions, the quantity $\varphi^{-1}(E(\varphi(Y)))$ can be approximated by a
linear combination of the mean and variance of $Y$. More recently, there has
been growing interest in risk-averse control using the Conditional
Value-at-Risk (CVaR) functional. In contrast to the EU functional, the CVaR of
a random variable $Y$ concerns a fraction of its possible realizations. If $Y$
is a continuous random variable with finite $E(|Y|)$, then the CVaR of $Y$ at
level $\alpha$ is the expectation of $Y$ in the $\alpha \cdot 100 \%$ worst
cases. Here, we study the applications of risk-averse functionals to controller
synthesis and safety analysis through the development of numerical examples,
with emphasis on EU and CVaR. Our contribution is to examine the
decision-theoretic, mathematical, and computational trade-offs that arise when
using EU and CVaR for optimal control and safety analysis. We are hopeful that
this work will advance the interpretability and elucidate the potential
benefits of risk-averse control technology.

the best of our knowledge, this is the first geometric landscape connection

manipulate and transport these quasiparticles would enable excitonic circuits
and devices for quantum photonic technologies. Recently, interlayer excitons in
2D semiconductors have emerged as a promising candidate for engineering
excitonic devices due to their long lifetime, large exciton binding energy, and
gate tunability. However, the charge-neutral nature of the excitons leads to
weak response to the in-plane electric field and thus inhibits transport beyond
the diffusion length. Here, we demonstrate the directional transport of
interlayer excitons in bilayer WSe2 driven by the propagating potential traps
induced by surface acoustic waves (SAW). We show that at 100 K, the SAW-driven
excitonic transport is activated above a threshold acoustic power and reaches
20 mm, a distance at least ten times longer than the diffusion length and only
limited by the device size. Temperature-dependent measurement reveals the
transition from the diffusion-limited regime at low temperature to the acoustic
field-driven regime at elevated temperature. Our work shows that acoustic waves
are an effective, contact-free means to control exciton dynamics and transport,
promising for realizing 2D materials-based excitonic devices such as exciton
transistors, switches, and transducers up to room temperature.

analyze in detail the strengths and weaknesses of the standard Rayleigh

conservative high Bayes factor threshold to obtain the black hole spectroscopy
horizons of current and future detectors, i.e., the distance (averaged in sky
location and binary inclination) up to which one or more additional modes can
be detected and confidently distinguished from each other. We set up all of our
searches for additional modes starting at $t = 10(M_1+M_2)$ after the peak
amplitude in simulated signals of circular nonspinning binaries. An agnostic
multimode analysis allows us to rank the subdominant modes: for nearly equal

asymmetric binaries, $(3,3,0)$ and $(4,4,0)$, for the secondary and tertiary

sources has brought tremendous challenges to both the power grid and its
surrounding markets. As datacenters have become ever-larger and more powerful,
they play an increasingly significant role in the energy arena. With their
unique characteristics, datacenters have been proved to be well-suited for
regulating the power grid yet currently provide little, if any, such active
response. This problem is due to issues such as unsuitability of the market
design, high complexity of the currently proposed solutions, as well as the
potential risks thereof. This work aims to provide individual datacenters with
insights on the feasibility and profitability of directly participating in the
energy market. By modelling the power system of datacenters, and by conducting
simulations on real-world datacenter traces, we demonstrate the substantial
financial incentive for individual datacenters to directly participate in both
the day-ahead and the balancing markets. In turn, we suggest a new short-term,
direct scheme of market participation for individual datacenters in place of
the current long-term, inactive participation. Furthermore, we develop a novel
proactive DVFS scheduling algorithm that can both reduce energy consumption and
save energy costs during the market participation of datacenters. Also, in
developing this scheduler, we propose an innovative combination of machine
learning methods and the DVFS technology that can provide the power grid with
indirect demand response (DR). Our experimental results strongly support that
individual datacenters can and should directly participate in the energy market
both to save their energy costs and to curb their energy consumption, whilst
providing the power grid with indirect DR.

that are incompatible with spatial periodicity. We use the proposed methods to
study gravity-capillary waves generated by flow around several elliptical
obstacles above a flat or variable bottom boundary. In each case, the free
surface eventually self-intersects in a splash singularity or collides with a
boundary. We also show how to evaluate the velocity and pressure with spectral
accuracy throughout the fluid, including near the free surface and solid
boundaries. To assess the accuracy of the time evolution, we monitor energy
conservation and the decay of Fourier modes and compare the numerical results
of the two methods to each other. We implement several solvers for the
discretized linear systems and compare their performance. The fastest approach
employs a graphics processing unit (GPU) to construct the matrices and carry
out iterations of the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES).

most sensitive to those parameters. The use of these high-resolution spectra
reduces the influence of distance uncertainties, reddening, and

total (fit + systematic) uncertainties were 170 K, 0.28 dex, 0.60 kG, 2.5 km

determined B for 41 Taurus YSOs (upper limits for the remainder) and find
systematic offsets (lower $T_{\rm eff}$, higher $\log$ g and $v \sin i$) in
parameters when B is measurable but not considered in the fit. The average
$\log$ g for the Class II and Class III objects differs by 0.23$\pm$0.05dex,
which is consistent with Class III objects being the more evolved members of
the star-forming region. However, the dispersion in $\log$ g is greater than
the uncertainties, which highlights how the YSO classification correlates with
age ($\log$ g), yet there are exceptionally young (lower $\log$ g) Class III
YSOs and relatively old (higher $\log$ g) Class II YSOs with unexplained

function and stability. However, existing recurrent spiking neural networks
(RSNNs) are often constructed by random connections without optimization. While
RSNNs can produce rich dynamics that are critical for memory formation and
learning, systemic architectural optimization of RSNNs is still an opening
challenge. We aim to enable systemic design of large RSNNs via a new scalable
RSNN architecture and automated architectural optimization. We compose RSNNs
based on a layer architecture called Sparsely-Connected Recurrent Motif Layer
(SC-ML) that consists of multiple small recurrent motifs wired together by
sparse lateral connections. The small size of the motifs and sparse inter-motif
connectivity leads to an RSNN architecture scalable to large network sizes. We
further propose a method called Hybrid Risk-Mitigating Architectural Search
(HRMAS) to systematically optimize the topology of the proposed recurrent
motifs and SC-ML layer architecture. HRMAS is an alternating two-step
optimization process by which we mitigate the risk of network instability and
performance degradation caused by architectural change by introducing a novel
biologically-inspired ""self-repairing"" mechanism through intrinsic plasticity.
The intrinsic plasticity is introduced to the second step of each HRMAS
iteration and acts as unsupervised fast self-adaption to structural and
synaptic weight modifications introduced by the first step during the RSNN
architectural ""evolution"". To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the
first work that performs systematic architectural optimization of RSNNs. Using
one speech and three neuromorphic datasets, we demonstrate the significant
performance improvement brought by the proposed automated architecture
optimization over existing manually-designed RSNNs.

that our approach finds similar, if not better, trajectories (in terms of

toxicity of online comments, estimating satiety of food depicted in images, and
estimating age based on portraits. We show that (1) Goldilocks can improve
consistency in domains where interpretation of the scale is not universal, and
that (2) representing items with ranges lets us simultaneously capture

supernovae (PISNe) that are luminous enough to observe even at z > 6 and allow
for the direct characterization of massive star properties at the reionization

tremendous impact on our understanding of massive star evolution and the
formation of stellar mass black holes. The near-infrared Wide Field Instrument
on Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope will excel at discovering such rare
high-redshift supernovae. In this work, we investigate the best survey strategy

methods that generate trajectories only in conservative local space or require
collision checking that has high computational cost, our method directly
generates (local) trajectories with imposing only waypoint constraints. If a
collision occurs, our method then estimates the post-impact state and computes
from there an intermediate waypoint to recover from the collision. To achieve
so, we develop two novel components: 1) a deformation recovery controller that
optimizes the robot's states during post-impact recovery phase, and 2) a
post-impact trajectory replanner that adjusts the next waypoint with the
information from the collision for the robot to pass through and generates a
polynomial-based minimum effort trajectory. The proposed strategy is evaluated
experimentally with an omni-directional impact-resilient wheeled robot. The
robot is designed in house, and it can perceive collisions with the aid of Hall
effect sensors embodied between the robot's main chassis and a surrounding

wide variety of complex cognitive and motor tasks, due to their rich temporal
dynamics and sparse processing. However training spiking RNNs on dedicated
neuromorphic hardware is still an open challenge. This is due mainly to the
lack of local, hardware-friendly learning mechanisms that can solve the
temporal credit assignment problem and ensure stable network dynamics, even
when the weight resolution is limited. These challenges are further
accentuated, if one resorts to using memristive devices for in-memory computing
to resolve the von-Neumann bottleneck problem, at the expense of a substantial
increase in variability in both the computation and the working memory of the
spiking RNNs. To address these challenges and enable online learning in
memristive neuromorphic RNNs, we present a simulation framework of
differential-architecture crossbar arrays based on an accurate and
comprehensive Phase-Change Memory (PCM) device model. We train a spiking RNN
whose weights are emulated in the presented simulation framework, using a
recently proposed e-prop learning rule. Although e-prop locally approximates
the ideal synaptic updates, it is difficult to implement the updates on the
memristive substrate due to substantial PCM non-idealities. We compare several
widely adapted weight update schemes that primarily aim to cope with these
device non-idealities and demonstrate that accumulating gradients can enable
online and efficient training of spiking RNN on memristive substrates.

interior design, where artists create a conceptual design for the space, build
a 3D model of the space, decorate, and then perform rendering. Although the
task is important, it is tedious and requires tremendous effort. In this paper,
we introduce a new problem of domain-specific indoor scene image synthesis,

a list of decorations with layout determined by user, we aim to synthesize a
new image of the same space with desired furnishing and decorations. Neural
scene decoration can be applied to create conceptual interior designs in a
simple yet effective manner. Our attempt to this research problem is a novel
scene generation architecture that transforms an empty scene and an object
layout into a realistic furnished scene photograph. We demonstrate the
performance of our proposed method by comparing it with conditional image
synthesis baselines built upon prevailing image translation approaches both
qualitatively and quantitatively. We conduct extensive experiments to further

  Detection",,,,,"cs.MM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The latest trend in the bottom-up perspective for arbitrary-shape scene text
detection is to reason the links between text segments using Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN). Notwithstanding, the performance of the best
performing bottom-up method is still inferior to that of the best performing
top-down method even with the help of GCN. We argue that this is not mainly
caused by the limited feature capturing ability of the text proposal backbone
or GCN, but by their failure to make a full use of visual-relational features
for suppressing false detection, as well as the sub-optimal route-finding
mechanism used for grouping text segments. In this paper, we revitalize the
classic text detection frameworks by aggregating the visual-relational features
of text with two effective false positive/negative suppression mechanisms.
First, dense overlapping text segments depicting the `characterness' and
`streamline' of text are generated for further relational reasoning and weakly
supervised segment classification. Here, relational graph features are used for
suppressing false positives/negatives. Then, to fuse the relational features
with visual features, a Location-Aware Transfer (LAT) module is designed to
transfer text's relational features into visual compatible features with a Fuse
Decoding (FD) module to enhance the representation of text regions for the
second step suppression. Finally, a novel multiple-text-map-aware
contour-approximation strategy is developed, instead of the widely-used
route-finding process. Experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets, i.e.,
CTW1500, Total-Text, ICDAR2015, MSRA-TD500, and MLT2017 demonstrate that our

automatic speech recognition (ASR) error detection during post-processing.
While error detection systems often take advantage of statistical language
archetypes captured by LMs, at times the pretrained knowledge can hinder error
detection performance. For instance, presence of speech disfluencies might
confuse the post-processing system into tagging disfluent but accurate
transcriptions as ASR errors. Such confusion occurs because both error
detection and disfluency detection tasks attempt to identify tokens at
statistically unlikely positions. This paper proposes a scheme to improve
existing LM-based ASR error detection systems, both in terms of detection
scores and resilience to such distracting auxiliary tasks. Our approach adopts
the popular mixup method in text feature space and can be utilized with any
black-box ASR output. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we
conduct post-processing experiments with both traditional and end-to-end ASR

address the above issues, we propose the Video Similarity and Alignment

model the temporal similarity as the mask map predicted from frame-level

step map is learned from the spatial similarity where the elements indicate
extending directions of the current partial alignments on the spatial-temporal

partial optimal alignments following instructions of the step map. With the
similarity and alignment learning strategy, VSAL achieves the state-of-the-art

reduced to a single degenerate nonlinear second order partial differential

echoes are characterized by the nearly constant time delay, and its precise
measurement can help reveal a Planck-scale deviation outside of the would-be
horizon. Different search methods have been developed for this quasiperiodic
signal, while the searches suffer from large theoretical uncertainties of the
echo waveform associated with the near-horizon physics. On the other hand, a
coherent combination of a large number of pulses gives rise to a generic narrow
resonance structure for the echo amplitude in frequency. The quasiperiodic
resonance structure sets a complementary search target for echoes, and the time
delay is inversely related to the average resonance spacing. A uniform comb has
been proposed to look for the resonance structure in a rather model-independent
way. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian algorithm to search for the resonance
structure based on combs, where a phase-marginalized likelihood plays an
essential role. The algorithm is validated with signal injections in detector
noise from Advanced LIGO. With special treatments of the non-Gaussian

data that is different from the training data. Manually labeling new data for
each test domain is often a time-consuming and laborious task. In this work, we
explore unsupervised domain adaptation in retinal vessel segmentation by using
entropy-based adversarial learning and transfer normalization layer to train a
segmentation network, which generalizes well across domains and requires no
annotation of the target domain. Specifically, first, an entropy-based
adversarial learning strategy is developed to reduce the distribution
discrepancy between the source and target domains while also achieving the
objective of entropy minimization on the target domain. In addition, a new
transfer normalization layer is proposed to further boost the transferability
of the deep network. It normalizes the features of each domain separately to
compensate for the domain distribution gap. Besides, it also adaptively selects
those feature channels that are more transferable between domains, thus further
enhancing the generalization performance of the network. We conducted extensive
experiments on three regular fundus image datasets and an ultra-widefield

performance gains compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

communicate among themselves via discrete tokens, accomplishing as a team what

more desirable aspects of communication such as zero-shot understanding.
Inspired by word embedding techniques from natural language processing, we
propose neural agent architectures that enables them to communicate via
discrete tokens derived from a learned, continuous space. We show in a decision
theoretic framework that our technique optimizes communication over a wide

learn to cluster tokens in semantically-meaningful ways, allowing them

learn a latent embedding as the style information. However, this embedding
process may encode redundant textual information. This phenomenon is called
content leakage. Researchers have attempted to resolve this problem by adding
an ASR or other auxiliary supervision loss functions. In this study, we propose
an unsupervised method called the ""information sieve"" to reduce the effect of
content leakage in prosody transfer. The rationale of this approach is that the
style encoder can be forced to focus on style information rather than on
textual information contained in the reference speech by a well-designed
downsample-upsample filter, i.e., the extracted style embeddings can be
downsampled at a certain interval and then upsampled by duplication.
Furthermore, we used instance normalization in convolution layers to help the
system learn a better latent style space. Objective metrics such as the
significantly lower word error rate (WER) demonstrate the effectiveness of this
model in mitigating content leakage. Listening tests indicate that the model
retains its prosody transferability compared with the baseline models such as
the original GST-Tacotron and ASR-guided Tacotron.

agents cannot interact with the environment and collect experiences during
learning, but have to learn from offline datasets. However, the transition
probabilities calculated from the dataset can be much different from the
transition probabilities induced by the learned policies of other agents,
creating large errors in value estimates. Moreover, the experience
distributions of agents' datasets may vary wildly due to diverse behavior
policies, causing large difference in value estimates between agents.
Consequently, agents will learn uncoordinated suboptimal policies. In this
paper, we propose MABCQ, which exploits value deviation and transition
normalization to modify the transition probabilities. Value deviation
optimistically increases the transition probabilities of high-value next
states, and transition normalization normalizes the biased transition
probabilities of next states. They together encourage agents to discover
potential optimal and coordinated policies. Mathematically, we prove the
convergence of Q-learning under the non-stationary transition probabilities

manifold $M$, we formulate new topological obstructions to $\Gamma$-invariant
metrics of positive scalar curvature on $M$ that take into account the
cohomology of the classifying space $\underline{B}\Gamma$ for proper actions.
In the cocompact case, this leads to a natural generalisation of
Gromov-Lawson's notion of higher $\hat{A}$-genera to the setting of proper
actions by groups with torsion. It is conjectured that these invariants
obstruct the existence of $\Gamma$-invariant positive scalar curvature on $M$.
For classes arising from the subring of $H^*(\underline{B}\Gamma,\mathbb{R})$
generated by elements of degree at most $2$, we are able to prove this, under
suitable assumptions, using index-theoretic methods for projectively invariant
Dirac operators and a twisted $L^2$-Lefschetz fixed-point theorem involving a
weighted trace on conjugacy classes. The latter generalises a result of
Wang-Wang to the projective setting. In the special case of free actions and
the trivial conjugacy class, this reduces to a theorem of Mathai, which
provided a partial answer to a conjecture of Gromov-Lawson on higher
$\hat{A}$-genera. If $M$ is non-cocompact, we obtain obstructions to $M$ being
a partitioning hypersurface inside a non-cocompact $\Gamma$-manifold with
non-negative scalar curvature that is positive in a neighbourhood of the
hypersurface. Finally, we define a quantitative version of the twisted higher

lower bound of the total curvature term in the square of the twisted Dirac

reinforcement learning algorithms in the real world. This paper explores the
possibility of safe RL algorithms with zero training-time safety violations in
the challenging setting where we are only given a safe but trivial-reward
initial policy without any prior knowledge of the dynamics model and additional
offline data. We propose an algorithm, Co-trained Barrier Certificate for Safe
RL (CRABS), which iteratively learns barrier certificates, dynamics models, and
policies. The barrier certificates, learned via adversarial training, ensure
the policy's safety assuming calibrated learned dynamics model. We also add a
regularization term to encourage larger certified regions to enable better
exploration. Empirical simulations show that zero safety violations are already
challenging for a suite of simple environments with only 2-4 dimensional state
space, especially if high-reward policies have to visit regions near the safety
boundary. Prior methods require hundreds of violations to achieve decent
rewards on these tasks, whereas our proposed algorithms incur zero violations.

collision at high collision energies. We study the signatures of turbulence in
this system and find that there are significant departures from isotropic
turbulence in the initial stages of the collision. Since the anisotropic
fluctuations are sub leading to the isotropic fluctuations, the Kolmogorov
spectrum can usually be obtained even for the initial stages. However, the
energy spectrum and the temperature fluctuations indicate deviations from
isotropic turbulence. Since a strong momentum anisotropy exists between the
transverse and the longitudinal plane, we study the energy density spectrum in
these two planes. The geometrical anisotropy is reflected in the anisotropic
turbulence generated in the rotating plasma and we find that the scaling
exponent is different in the two planes. We find that the scaling exponents in
the longitudinal plane are independent of centrality while the scaling exponent
in the transverse plane depends on the centrality range. We also obtain the
temperature spectrum in the initial stages. The spectrum deviates from the
Gaussian spectra expected for an isotropic turbulence. All these seem to
indicate that the large scale momentum anisotropy persists in the smaller
length scales for the relativistic heavy ion collisions.

methods to estimate distribution-associated functions from potentially censored

methods, including the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Turnbull's method, often
result in overfitting, especially when the sample size is small. We propose an
improvement to these methods by applying kernel smoothing to their raw
estimates, based on a BIC-type loss function that balances the trade-off
between optimizing model fit and controlling model complexity. In the context
of a longitudinal study with repeated observations, we detail our proposed
smoothing procedure and optimization algorithm. With extensive simulation
studies over multiple realistic scenarios, we demonstrate that our
smoothing-based procedure provides better overall accuracy in both survival
function estimation and individual-level time-to-event prediction by reducing
overfitting. Our smoothing procedure decreases the discrepancy between the
estimated and true simulated survival function using interval-censored data by
up to 49% compared to the raw un-smoothed estimate, with similar improvements
of up to 41% and 23% in within-sample and out-of-sample prediction,
respectively. Finally, we apply our method to real data on censored breast
cancer diagnosis, which similarly shows improvement when compared to empirical
survival estimates from uncensored data. We provide an R package, SISE, for

an extension of soft actor critic model to estimate the execution risk of a

catalog. We investigate torus knots up to 1023 crossings, establishing a

operation on ropelength, finding that a satellite knot typically has thrice the

the effects of hydrostatic pressure in EuCd$_2$As$_2$. For that, we present
specific heat, transport and $\mu$SR measurements under hydrostatic pressure up
to $\sim\,2.5\,$GPa, combined with {\it ab initio} density functional theory
(DFT) calculations. Experimentally, we establish that the ground state of
EuCd$_2$As$_2$ changes from in-plane antiferromagnetic (AFM$_{ab}$) to
ferromagnetic at a critical pressure of $\,\approx\,$2\,GPa, which is likely
characterized by the moments dominantly lying within the $ab$ plane
(FM$_{ab}$). The AFM$_{ab}$-FM$_{ab}$ transition at such a relatively low
pressure is supported by our DFT calculations. Furthermore, our experimental
and theoretical results indicate that EuCd$_2$As$_2$ moves closer to the
sought-for FM$_c$ state (moments $\parallel$ $c$) with increasing pressure
further. We predict that a pressure of $\approx$\,23\,GPa will stabilize the

hydrostatic pressure as a key tuning parameter that (i) allows for a continuous
tuning between magnetic ground states in a single sample of EuCd$_2$As$_2$ and

applications, such as propellers and fans. Leading edge noise models, e.g.,
Amiet's model, are widely applied to predict the noise produced by these
applications. This noise prediction model relies on the accuracy of the
turbulence spectrum, which is usually assumed to be the von K\'arm\'an energy
spectrum for isotropic turbulence. However, the von K\'arm\'an spectrum does
not model accurately the dissipation range of the turbulent energy, resulting
in incorrect far-field noise predictions for the high-frequency range. An
exponential correction can be applied to the spectrum to model the dissipation
range. This correction depends on the dissipation frequency, which is the
frequency where the energy spectrum changes from a dependence of $k^{-5/3}$ to
an exponential decay. This study experimentally investigates nearly isotropic
inflow turbulence and determines the flow field characteristics that affect the
dissipation frequency in order to model this frequency and the dissipation
range. Experiments have been conducted with two passive grids and hot-wire
anemometry in the Aeroacoustic Wind Tunnel of the University of Twente. The
turbulence uniformity in the test section and the turbulence development in the
streamwise direction were analyzed, showing that the grid generated turbulence
was mostly uniform and nearly isotropic. The dissipation frequency was observed
to depend on the turbulence intensity, the free-stream velocity, and the
turbulence length scale. An expression to compute this frequency is proposed,
as well as a formula to predict the dissipation range. The predicted leading
edge noise is affected by the dissipation range modelling in the high-frequency

frequent disturbances caused by their associated merging, weaving, and
lane-changing behaviors. With real-time communication and precise motion
control, Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) provide an opportunity to
substantially enhance the traffic operational performance of on-ramp
bottlenecks. In this paper, we propose an upper-level control strategy to
coordinate the two traffic streams at on-ramp merging through proactive gap
creation and platoon formation. The coordination consists of three components:
(1) mainline vehicles proactively decelerate to create large merging gaps; (2)
ramp vehicles form platoons before entering the main road; (3) the gaps created
on the main road and the platoons formed on the ramp are coordinated with each
other in terms of size, speed, and arrival time. The coordination is formulated
as a constrained optimization problem, incorporating both macroscopic and
microscopic traffic flow models, for flow-level efficiency gains. The model
uses traffic state parameters as inputs and determines the optimal coordination
plan adaptive to real-time traffic conditions. The benefits of the proposed
coordination are demonstrated through an illustrative case study. Results show
that the coordination is compatible with real-world implementation and can
substantially improve the overall efficiency of on-ramp merging, especially
under high traffic volume conditions, where recurrent traffic congestion is
prevented, and merging throughput increased.

re-acceleration of cosmic ray (CR) protons via diffusive shock acceleration
(DSA) by multiple shocks could enhance the acceleration efficiency and flatten
the CR spectrum, compared to a single episode of DSA. Here we examine the CR
electron acceleration through multiple re-acceleration by considering energy
losses and decompression of the particle distribution and magnetic fields in
the postshock region between consecutive shock passages. We find that the
accumulated effects of repeated re-acceleration are significant, if preceding
shocks are stronger than the last shock and the shock passage interval is
$\lesssim20$ Myr. In such cases, both the CR spectrum and the ensuing radiation
spectrum behind the last shock are enhanced and become flatter than the
canonical DSA power-law forms. As a result, the shock Mach number estimated
from radio observations tends be higher than the actual Mach number of the last
shock. Thus, multiple episodes of DSA may explain the enhanced acceleration
efficiency for CR electrons and the discrepancy of shock Mach numbers, $M_{\rm

propose an online planning algorithm which adapts the UAV paths to obtain
high-resolution semantic segmentations necessary in areas on the terrain with
fine details as they are detected in incoming images. This enables us to
perform close inspections at low altitudes only where required, without wasting
energy on exhaustive mapping at maximum resolution. A key feature of our
approach is a new accuracy model for deep learning-based architectures that

computation demands in Mobile Target Tracking Wireless Sensor Networks
(MTT-WSN). This paradigm can offload time-sensitive tasks to sink nodes to
improve computing efficiency. Nevertheless, it is difficult to execute dynamic
and critical tasks in the MTT-WSN network. Besides, the network cannot ensure
consecutive tracking due to the limited energy. To address the problems, this
paper proposes a new hierarchical target tracking structure based on Edge
Intelligence (EI) technology. The structure integrates the computing resource
of both mobile nodes and edge servers to provide efficient computation
capability for real-time target tracking. Based on the proposed structure, we
formulate an energy optimization model with the constrains of system execution
latency and trajectory prediction accuracy. Moreover, we propose a long-term
dynamic resource allocation algorithm to obtain the optimal resource allocation
solution for the ac- curate and consecutive tracking. Simulation results
demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms the deep Q-learning over 14.5% in
terms of system energy consumption. It can also obtain a significant
enhancement in tracking accuracy compared with the non-cooperative scheme.

showed that any graph $G$ is uniquely determined by its generalized spectrum
(DGS) whenever $2^{-\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}\det W$ is odd and square-free. In this

show that the problem of finding the generalized cospectral mate for a graph in
$\mathcal{F}_n$ is equivalent to that of generating an appropriate rational
orthogonal matrix from a given integral vector. This equivalence essentially
depends on an amazing property of graphs in terms of generalized spectra, which
states that any symmetric integral matrix generalized cospectral with the
adjacency matrix of some graph must be an adjacency matrix. Based on this
equivalence, we develop an efficient algorithm to decide whether a given graph
in $\mathcal{F}_n$ is DGS and further to find the unique generalized cospectral
mate when it is not. We give some experimental results on graphs with at most
20 vertices, which suggest that $\mathcal{F}_n$ may have a positive density
(nearly $3\%$) and possibly almost all graphs in $\mathcal{F}_n$ are DGS as
$n\rightarrow \infty$. This gives a supporting evidence for Haemers' conjecture
that almost all graphs are determined by their spectra.

composite system that promises numerous applications. The present study probes
the collective plasmonic characteristics and resulting photothermal behavior of
closed packed 2D Au nanoparticle clusters in order to delineate the effects of
cluster size, inter-particle distance and particle size. Smaller nanoparticles
(20 nm and 40 nm in diameter) that exhibit low individual scattering and high
absorption were considered for their relevance to photothermal applications. In
contrast to typical literature studies, the present study compares the optical
response of clusters of different sizes ranging from a single nanoparticle up

significant changes to the spectral position and opto-physical characteristics.
Based on the model outcome, an optimal cluster size for maximum absorption per

of particle size and inter-particle distance is investigated in order to
elucidate the nature of interaction in terms of near-field and far-field
coupling. The photothermal effect resulting from absorption is compared for
different cluster sizes and inter-particle distances considering a homogeneous

(PCT) to construct a simple closed-loop model which requires no training

dynamic error signal by subtracting the incoming signal for each perceptual

We tested the same model across two different Atari paddle games Breakout and

current main limitations for broader urban wind energy exploitation. Trailing
edge noise, caused by the turbulent boundary layer interacting with the airfoil
surface, is the primary source of noise of modern horizontal and vertical axis
wind turbines. Low inflow turbulence levels do not affect the trailing edge
noise. However, an inflow of high turbulence intensity has flow structures that
can penetrate the boundary layer, increasing the velocity fluctuations inside
the boundary layer and, consequently, the wall pressure fluctuations and
trailing edge noise. This research investigates the effect of high free-stream
turbulence, observed in the atmospheric boundary layer of urban zones, in the
trailing edge noise generation. This was performed by measuring the increment
of the turbulence inside of the boundary layer and surface pressure
fluctuations near the trailing edge when an airfoil is submitted to high inflow
turbulence. Experimental measurements were performed in the Aeroacoustic Wind
Tunnel of the University of Twente on a NACA 0012 airfoil subjected to a
turbulent inflow. The chord-based Reynolds number of the experiments ranged
from 170 x 10^3 to 500 x 10^3. Results showed that high inflow turbulence
significantly increases the velocity fluctuations and the integral length scale
along the entire boundary layer, resulting in an increment of the surface
pressure spectrum more than 6 dB and 10 dB in the entire frequency range for
10% and 20% of free-stream turbulence, respectively. The 10% free-stream
turbulence increases the velocity fluctuations just in the low--frequency
range, whereas the 20% inflow turbulence influences the velocity spectrum in
the entire frequency range, increasing the size of the smallest structures of
the turbulence. Amiet's theory is applied to predict the trailing edge
far-field noise.

then the category $\mathcal{C}$ of grading-restricted generalized $V$-modules
is a rigid tensor category. We further show, without any assumption on the

The proofs of these theorems use techniques and results from tensor categories
together with the method of Moore-Seiberg and Huang for deriving identities of
two-point genus-one correlation functions associated to $V$. We give two main
applications. First, we prove the conjecture of Kac-Wakimoto and Arakawa that

proof uses the recent result of Arakawa and van Ekeren that such $W$-algebras
have semisimple (Ramond twisted) Zhu algebras. Second, we use our rigidity
results to reduce the ""coset rationality problem"" to the problem of
$C_2$-cofiniteness for the coset. That is, given a vertex operator algebra
inclusion $U\otimes V\hookrightarrow A$ with $A$, $U$ strongly rational and
$U$, $V$ a pair of mutual commutant subalgebras in $A$, we show that $V$ is

task-specific labels but instead adopts regression on a set of manually
designed synthetic signal bases for architecture evaluation. Such a
self-supervised regression task can effectively evaluate the intrinsic power of
an architecture to capture and transform the input signal patterns, and allow
more sufficient usage of training samples. Extensive experiments across 13 CNN

achieving Byzantine fault tolerance (BFT)~\cite{lachesis01}. Each node in
Lachesis protocol operates on a local block DAG, namely \emph{OPERA DAG}.
Aiming for a low time to finality (TTF) for transactions, our general model
considers DAG streams of high speed but asynchronous events. We integrate
Proof-of-Stake (PoS) into a DAG model in Lachesis protocol to improve
performance and security. Our general model of trustless system leverages
participants' stake as their validating power~\cite{stakedag}. Lachesis's
consensus algorithm uses Lamport timestamps, graph layering and concurrent
common knowledge to guarantee a consistent total ordering of event blocks and
transactions. In addition, Lachesis protocol allows dynamic participation of
new nodes into Opera network. Lachesis optimizes DAG storage and processing
time by splitting local history into checkpoints (so-called epochs). We also
propose a model to improve stake decentralization, and network safety and
liveness ~\cite{stairdag}.
  Built on our novel Lachesis protocol, Fantom's Opera platform is a public,
leaderless, asynchronous BFT, layer-1 blockchain, with guaranteed deterministic
finality. Hence, Lachesis protocol is suitable for distributed ledgers by
leveraging asynchronous partially ordered sets with logical time ordering
instead of blockchains. We also present our proofs into a model that can be
applied to abstract asynchronous distributed system.

demonstrate that our proposed FPB based model outperforms state-of-the-art
methods with obvious margin as well as much less model complexity. FPB borrows
the idea of the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) from prevailing object detection
methods. To our best knowledge, it is the first successful application of
similar structure in person Re-ID tasks, which empirically proves that pyramid
network as affiliated branch could be a potential structure in related feature
embedding models. The source code is publicly available at

chamber (LArTPC) that was constructed and operated in the CERN North Area at
the end of the H4 beamline. This detector is a prototype for the first far
detector module of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), which will
be constructed at the Sandford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead,
South Dakota, USA. The ProtoDUNE-SP detector incorporates full-size components
as designed for DUNE and has an active volume of $7\times 6\times 7.2$~m$^3$.
The H4 beam delivers incident particles with well-measured momenta and
high-purity particle identification. ProtoDUNE-SP's successful operation
between 2018 and 2020 demonstrates the effectiveness of the single-phase far
detector design. This paper describes the design, construction, assembly and
operation of the detector components.

  Variability Data Application","6 pages with two columns, 4 figures, 3 tables",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While machine learning techniques are being applied to various fields for
their exceptional ability to find complex relations in large datasets, the
strengthening of regulations on data ownership and privacy is causing
increasing difficulty in its application to medical data. In light of this,
Federated Learning has recently been proposed as a solution to train on private
data without breach of confidentiality. This conservation of privacy is
particularly appealing in the field of healthcare, where patient data is highly
confidential. However, many studies have shown that its assumption of
Independent and Identically Distributed data is unrealistic for medical data.
In this paper, we propose Personalized Federated Cluster Models, a hierarchical
clustering-based FL process, to predict Major Depressive Disorder severity from
Heart Rate Variability. By allowing clients to receive more personalized model,
we address problems caused by non-IID data, showing an accuracy increase in
severity prediction. This increase in performance may be sufficient to use
Personalized Federated Cluster Models in many existing Federated Learning
scenarios.

her private data may, when sent to the model manager, leak information on those
private data. Even more obvious are security attacks, whereby one or several
malicious peers return wrong model updates in order to disrupt the learning
process and lead to a wrong model being learned. In this paper we build a
federated learning framework that offers privacy to the participating peers as
well as security against Byzantine and poisoning attacks. Our framework
consists of several protocols that provide strong privacy to the participating
peers via unlinkable anonymity and that are rationally sustainable based on the
co-utility property. In other words, no rational party is interested in
deviating from the proposed protocols. We leverage the notion of co-utility to
build a decentralized co-utile reputation management system that provides
incentives for parties to adhere to the protocols. Unlike privacy protection
via differential privacy, our approach preserves the values of model updates
and hence the accuracy of plain federated learning; unlike privacy protection
via update aggregation, our approach preserves the ability to detect bad model
updates while substantially reducing the computational overhead compared to

free-free process. These photons can contribute the diffuse free-free
background radiation in the frequency range of the cosmic microwave background
radiation (CMB). We show that the intensity of the free-free background
radiation from PBHs depends on the mass and abundance of PBHs. In particular,
considering the growth of a dark matter (DM) halo around a PBH by non-PBH DM
particles strongly enhances the free-free background radiation. Large PBH
fraction increase the signal of the free-free emission. However, large PBH
fraction also can heat the IGM gas and, accordingly, suppresses the accretion
rate. As a result, the free-free emission decreases when the PBH fraction is
larger than 0.1. We find that the free-free emission from PBHs in the CMB and
radio frequency is much lower than the CMB blackbody spectrum and the observed
free-free emission component in the background radiation. Therefore, it is
difficult to obtain the constraint from the free-free emission observation.
However further theoretical understanding and observation on the free-free
emission from cosmological origin is helpful to study the PBH abundance with
the stellar mass.

dynamo theories. Moreover, flares are thought to crucially affect the
habitability of exoplanets that orbit these stars. Measuring the location of
flares on stars other than the Sun is challenging due to the lack of spatial
resolution. Here we present four fully convective stars observed with the
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) that displayed large,
long-duration flares in white-light which were modulated in brightness by the
stars' fast rotation. This allowed us to determine the loci of these flares
directly from the light curves. All four flares occurred at latitudes between
55 deg and 81 deg, far higher than typical solar flare latitudes. Our findings
are evidence that strong magnetic fields tend to emerge close to the stellar

is an essential performance measure for time-critical applications in Internet
of Things (IoT). With the surge of computing resources at the IoT devices, it
is possible to preprocess the information packets that contain the status
update before sending them to the destination so as to alleviate the
transmission burden. However, the additional time and energy expenditure
induced by computing also make the optimal updating a non-trivial problem. In
this paper, we consider a time-critical IoT system, where the IoT device is
capable of preprocessing the status update before the transmission.
Particularly, we aim to jointly design the preprocessing and transmission so
that the weighted sum of the average AoI of the destination and the energy
consumption of the IoT device is minimized. Due to the heterogeneity in
transmission and computation capacities, the durations of distinct actions of
the IoT device are non-uniform. Therefore, we formulate the status updating
problem as an infinite horizon average cost semi-Markov decision process (SMDP)
and then transform it into a discrete-time Markov decision process. We
demonstrate that the optimal policy is of threshold type with respect to the
AoI. Equipped with this, a structure-aware relative policy iteration algorithm
is proposed to obtain the optimal policy of the SMDP. Our analysis shows that
preprocessing is more beneficial in regimes of high AoIs, given it can reduce
the time required for updates. We further prove the switching structure of the
optimal policy in a special scenario, where the status updates are transmitted
over a reliable channel, and derive the optimal threshold. Finally, simulation
results demonstrate the efficacy of preprocessing and show that the proposed
policy outperforms two baseline policies.

systems. However, the existing systems are not friendly enough for users like
data analysts and algorithm engineers. On the one hand, the programing models
and interfaces differ a lot in the existing systems, leading to high learning
costs and program migration costs. On the other hand, these graph processing
systems are tightly bound to the underlying distributed computing platforms,
requiring users to be familiar with distributed computing. To improve the
usability of distributed graph processing, we propose a unified distributed
graph programming framework UniGPS. Firstly, we propose a unified
cross-platform graph programming model VCProg for UniGPS. VCProg hides details
of distributed computing from users. It is compatible with the popular graph
programming models Pregel, GAS, and Push-Pull. VCProg programs can be executed
by compatible distributed graph processing systems without modification,
reducing the learning overheads of users. Secondly, UniGPS supports Python as
the programming language. We propose an interprocess-communication-based
execution environment isolation mechanism to enable Java/C++-based systems to
call user-defined methods written in Python. The experimental results show that
UniGPS enables users to process big graphs beyond the memory capacity of a
single machine without sacrificing usability. UniGPS shows near-linear data
scalability and machine scalability.

constraints. We present an analysis of the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift
Survey (VIPERS) over the redshift range $0.6 < z < 1$ that is optimised to
extract the cosmological parameters while fully accounting for the complex
survey geometry. We employ the Gibbs sampling algorithm to iteratively draw
samples of the galaxy density field in redshift space, the galaxy bias, the
matter density, baryon fraction and growth-rate parameter $f\sigma_8$ based on
a multivariate Gaussian likelihood and prior on the density field. Despite the
high number of degrees of freedom, the samples converge to the joint posterior
distribution and give self-consistent constraints on the model parameters. We
validate the approach using VIPERS mock galaxy catalogues. Although the
uncertainty is underestimated by the Gaussian likelihood on the scales that we
consider by 50 %, the dispersion of the results from the mock catalogues gives
a robust error estimate. We find that the precision of the results matches
those of the traditional analyses applied to the VIPERS data that use more
constrained models. By relaxing the model assumptions, we confirm that the data
deliver consistent constraints on the $\Lambda$CDM model. This work provides a
case-study for the application of maximum-likelihood analyses for the next

remaining eigenvalues, we demonstrate two qualitatively distinct types of
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking. Within a subset of the parameter space
corresponding to the topologically non-trivial phase of the SSH chains, a gap
opens within the broken $\mathcal{PT}$ regime of the discrete eigenvalue
spectrum. For relatively smaller values of $\gamma$, the eigenvalues are
embedded in the two SSH bands and hence become destabilized primarily due to
the resonance interaction with the continuum. We refer to this as
reservoir-assisted $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking. As the value of $\gamma$
is increased, the eigenvalues exit the SSH bands and the discrete eigenstates
become more strongly localized in the central trimer region. This approximate
decoupling results in the discrete spectrum behaving more like the independent
trimer, including both a region in which the $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry is
restored (the gap) and a second region in which it is broken again. At the
exceptional point (EP) marking the boundary between the gap and the second
$\mathcal{PT}$-broken region, two of the eigenstates coalesce with the
localized zero-energy mode, resulting in a third-order exceptional point (EP3).
At the other boundaries of the parameter space at which the gap vanishes,
similar higher-order EPs can form as pairs of the discrete eigenstates coalesce
with either of the two zero-energy states. The EPs of order $N$ formed of the
localized zero-energy state give rise to a characteristic $\sim t^{2N-2}$
evolution in the survival probability dynamics, which we propose to measure in

superconductors and review theoretical insights into the electronic nematic
order, bond-charge orders, and plasmons. The low-energy charge dynamics is
controlled by the spin-spin interaction J, which generates various bond-charge
ordering tendencies including the electronic nematic order. The nematic order
is driven by a d-wave Pomeranchuk instability and is pronounced in the
underdoped region as well as around van Hove filling in the hole-doped case;
the nematic tendency is weak in the electron-doped region. Nematicity
consistent with the d-wave Pomeranchuk instability was reported for hole-doped
cuprates in various experiments. Although the t-J and Hubbard models correctly
predicted the proximity to the nematic instability in cuprates far before the
experimental indications were obtained, full understanding of the charge
ordering tendencies in hole-doped cuprates still requires further theoretical
studies. In electron-doped cuprates, on the other hand, the d-wave bond-charge
excitations around momentum q=(0.5pi,0) explain the resonant x-ray scattering
data very well. Plasmon excitations are also present and the agreement between
the large-N theory of the t-J model and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering
measurements is nearly quantitative in both hole- and electron-doped cuprates.
Theoretically the charge dynamics in cuprates is summarized as a dual structure
in energy space: the low-energy region scaled by J, where the nematic and
various bond-charge orders are relevant, and the high-energy region typically
larger than J, where plasmons are predominant.

completely automatic method to segment cerebral hemispheres in magnetic
resonance (MR) volumes of rats with lesions. MedicDeepLabv3+ improves the
state-of-the-art DeepLabv3+ with an advanced decoder, incorporating spatial
attention layers and additional skip connections that, as we show in our
experiments, lead to more precise segmentations. MedicDeepLabv3+ requires no MR
image preprocessing, such as bias-field correction or registration to a
template, produces segmentations in less than a second, and its GPU memory
requirements can be adjusted based on the available resources. We optimized
MedicDeepLabv3+ and six other state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks
(DeepLabv3+, UNet, HighRes3DNet, V-Net, VoxResNet, Demon) on a heterogeneous
training set comprised by MR volumes from 11 cohorts acquired at different
lesion stages. Then, we evaluated the trained models and two approaches
specifically designed for rodent MRI skull stripping (RATS and RBET) on a large
dataset of 655 MR rat brain volumes. In our experiments, MedicDeepLabv3+
outperformed the other methods, yielding an average Dice coefficient of 0.952
and 0.944 in the brain and contralateral hemisphere regions. Additionally, we
show that despite limiting the GPU memory and the training data, our
MedicDeepLabv3+ also provided satisfactory segmentations. In conclusion, our
method, publicly available at https://github.com/jmlipman/MedicDeepLabv3Plus,
yielded excellent results in multiple scenarios, demonstrating its capability
to reduce human workload in rat neuroimaging studies.

sublattice states. The uniform squeezed vacuum and one-magnon states were shown
to display a massive sublattice entanglement. Here we expand this investigation
and study the squeezing properties of all sublattice Fock states throughout the
magnetic Brillouin zone. We derive the full statistics of the sublattice magnon
number with wave number $\vec k$ in the ground state and show that magnons are
created in pairs with opposite wavevectors, hence, resulting in entanglement of
both modes. To quantify the degree of entanglement we apply the
Duan-Giedke-Cirac-Zoller inequality and show that it can be violated for all

the N\'eel and the magnetization vectors, thus, allowing to experimentally test
the quantum nature of the squeezed vacuum. The distinct $\vec k$-space
structure of the probabilites shows that the squeezed vacuum has a nonuniform
shape that is revealed through the $\vec k$-dependent correlators for the

larger instruments or sensors at higher altitude, with significant benefits to

these orbits has spurred the development of new technologies that have the
potential to enable sustainable operations in this lower altitude range. In
this paper, system models are developed for (i) novel materials that improve
aerodynamic performance enabling reduced drag or increased lift production and
resistance to atomic oxygen erosion and (ii) atmosphere-breathing electric

Attitude and orbit control methods that can take advantage of the aerodynamic

integrated into a framework for concept-level satellite design and this
approach is used to explore the system-level trade-offs for future EO

magnetic field. We propose that electrons accelerated in these reconnection
regions can be responsible for efficient comptonization of stellar radiation
producing gamma-ray emission. We investigate the propagation of electrons in
the equatorial region of the magnetosphere by including their advection with
the equatorial wind. The synchrotron and IC spectra are calculated assuming
that a significant part of the wind energy is transferred to relativistic
electrons. As an example, the parameters of luminous, strongly magnetized star
HD 37022 ($\Theta^1$ Ori C) are considered. The IC gamma-ray emission is
predicted to be detected either in the GeV energy range by the Fermi-LAT
telescope or in the sub-TeV energies by the Cherenkov Telescope Array. However,
since the stellar winds are often time variable and the magnetic axis can be
inclined to the rotational axis of the star, the gamma-ray emission is expected
to show variability with the rotational period of the star and, on a longer

Leveraging the colorized skeleton point cloud, we design an auto-encoder
framework that can learn spatial-temporal features from the artificial color
labels of skeleton joints effectively. We evaluate our skeleton cloud
colorization approach with action classifiers trained under different
configurations, including unsupervised, semi-supervised and fully-supervised

demonstrated to be a rich platform for x-ray quantum optics. At low excitation,
these systems can be described by effective few-level schemes, thereby
providing tunable artificial quantum systems at hard x-ray energies. With the
recent advent of an ab initio theory, a numerically efficient description of
these systems is now possible. On this basis, we introduce the inverse design
and develop a comprehensive optimization for an archetype system with a single
resonant layer, corresponding to an artificial two-level scheme. We discover a
number of qualitative insights into x-ray photonic environments for nuclei that
will likely impact the design of future x-ray cavities and thereby improve
their performance. The presented methods readily generalize beyond the
two-level case and thus provide a clear perspective towards the inverse design
of more advanced tunable x-ray quantum optical level schemes.

for training, emerging unsupervised VAD (UVAD) aims to discover anomalies
directly from fully unlabeled videos. However, existing UVAD methods still rely
on shallow models to perform detection or initialization, and they are
evidently inferior to classic VAD methods. This paper proposes a full deep
neural network (DNN) based solution that can realize highly effective UVAD.
First, we, for the first time, point out that deep reconstruction can be
surprisingly effective for UVAD, which inspires us to unveil a property named
""normality advantage"", i.e., normal events will enjoy lower reconstruction loss
when DNN learns to reconstruct unlabeled videos. With this property, we propose
Localization based Reconstruction (LBR) as a strong UVAD baseline and a solid
foundation of our solution. Second, we propose a novel self-paced refinement
(SPR) scheme, which is synthesized into LBR to conduct UVAD. Unlike ordinary
self-paced learning that injects more samples in an easy-to-hard manner, the
proposed SPR scheme gradually drops samples so that suspicious anomalies can be
removed from the learning process. In this way, SPR consolidates normality
advantage and enables better UVAD in a more proactive way. Finally, we further
design a variant solution that explicitly takes the motion cues into account.
The solution evidently enhances the UVAD performance, and it sometimes even
surpasses the best classic VAD methods. Experiments show that our solution not
only significantly outperforms existing UVAD methods by a wide margin (5% to 9%
AUROC), but also enables UVAD to catch up with the mainstream performance of
classic VAD.

addresses the need for a new approach to HW sign-off verification which
guarantees the security of processors at the Register Transfer Level (RTL). To
this end, we introduce a formal definition of security with respect to
transient execution attacks, formulated as a HW property. We present a formal
proof methodology based on Unique Program Execution Checking (UPEC) which can
be used to systematically detect all vulnerabilities to transient execution
attacks in RTL designs. UPEC does not exploit any a priori knowledge on known
attacks and can therefore detect also vulnerabilities based on new, so far
unknown, types of channels. This is demonstrated by two new attack scenarios
discovered in our experiments with UPEC. UPEC scales to a wide range of HW
designs, including in-order processors (RocketChip), pipelines with
out-of-order writeback (Ariane), and processors with deep out-of-order
speculative execution (BOOM). To the best of our knowledge, UPEC is the first
RTL verification technique that exhaustively covers transient execution side
channels in processors of realistic complexity.

  Alternative Training and Geometric Constraints from 3D to 2D","9 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Self-supervised learning of depth and ego-motion from unlabeled monocular
video has acquired promising results and drawn extensive attention. Most
existing methods jointly train the depth and pose networks by photometric
consistency of adjacent frames based on the principle of structure-from-motion
(SFM). However, the coupling relationship of the depth and pose networks
seriously influences the learning performance, and the re-projection relations
is sensitive to scale ambiguity, especially for pose learning. In this paper,
we aim to improve the depth-pose learning performance without the auxiliary
tasks and address the above issues by alternative training each task and
incorporating the epipolar geometric constraints into the Iterative Closest
Point (ICP) based point clouds match process. Distinct from jointly training
the depth and pose networks, our key idea is to better utilize the mutual
dependency of these two tasks by alternatively training each network with
respective losses while fixing the other. We also design a log-scale 3D
structural consistency loss to put more emphasis on the smaller depth values
during training. To makes the optimization easier, we further incorporate the
epipolar geometry into the ICP based learning process for pose learning.
Extensive experiments on various benchmarks datasets indicate the superiority
of our algorithm over the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods.

few fundamental problems of quantum mechanics. Nonetheless, its solution is not
complete yet. The known results just indicate that if U(r) decays fast enough
at r tends to zero, the spectrum of the Schrodinger equation is not bounded
from below. However, the wave functions of the problem are singular at r = 0
and do not admit the limiting transition to the wave function of the ground
state. Therefore, the unboundedness of the spectrum is only the necessary
condition. To prove that a quantum particle indeed can fall to the center, a
wave function describing the fall should be obtained explicitly. This is done
in the present paper. Specifically, an exact solution of the time-dependent
Schrodinger equation describing the fall to the center is obtained and
analyzed. The law describing the collapse to a single point of the region of
the wave function localization is obtained explicitly, as well as the temporal
dependences of the average kinetic and potential energy of the falling particle
and its momentum. It is shown that the known necessary conditions for the

been prioritised by the World Health Organisation. Here we present an
age-structured model for the immune response to an HBV infection, which takes
into account contributions from both cell-mediated and humoral immunity. The
model has been validated using published patient data recorded during acute
infection. It has been adapted to the scenarios of chronic infection, clearance
of infection, and flare-ups via variation of the immune response parameters.
The impacts of immune response exhaustion and non-infectious subviral particles
on the immune response dynamics are analysed. A comparison of different
treatment options in the context of this model reveals that drugs targeting
aspects of the viral life cycle are more effective than exhaustion therapy, a
form of therapy mitigating immune response exhaustion. Our results suggest that
antiviral treatment is best started when viral load is declining rather than in
a flare-up. The model suggests that a fast antibody production rate always lead
to viral clearance, highlighting the promise of antibody therapies currently in
clinical trials.

provides a surrogate model of a (potentially expensive) PDE discretization, on
which optimization iterations are executed. Because POD models usually provide
good approximation quality only locally, they have to be updated during
optimization. Updating the POD model is usually expensive, however, and
therefore often impossible in a model-predictive control (MPC) context. Thus,
reduced models of mediocre quality might be accepted. We take the view of a
simplified Newton method for solving semilinear evolution equations to derive
an algorithm that can serve as an offline phase to produce a POD model.
Approaches that build the POD model with impulse response snapshots can be
regarded as the first Newton step in this context.
  In particular, POD models that are based on impulse response snapshots are
extended by adding a second simplified Newton step. This procedure improves the
approximation quality of the POD model significantly by introducing a moderate
amount of extra computational costs during optimization or the MPC loop. We
illustrate our findings with an example satisfying our assumptions.

  arXiv:2006.07214",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Exponential families are widely used in machine learning, including many
distributions in continuous and discrete domains (e.g., Gaussian, Dirichlet,
Poisson, and categorical distributions via the softmax transformation).
Distributions in each of these families have fixed support. In contrast, for
finite domains, recent work on sparse alternatives to softmax (e.g., sparsemax,
$\alpha$-entmax, and fusedmax), has led to distributions with varying support.
  This paper develops sparse alternatives to continuous distributions, based on
several technical contributions: First, we define $\Omega$-regularized
prediction maps and Fenchel-Young losses for arbitrary domains (possibly
countably infinite or continuous). For linearly parametrized families, we show
that minimization of Fenchel-Young losses is equivalent to moment matching of
the statistics, generalizing a fundamental property of exponential families.
When $\Omega$ is a Tsallis negentropy with parameter $\alpha$, we obtain
``deformed exponential families,'' which include $\alpha$-entmax and sparsemax
($\alpha=2$) as particular cases. For quadratic energy functions, the resulting
densities are $\beta$-Gaussians, an instance of elliptical distributions that
contain as particular cases the Gaussian, biweight, triweight, and Epanechnikov
densities, and for which we derive closed-form expressions for the variance,
Tsallis entropy, and Fenchel-Young loss. When $\Omega$ is a total variation or
Sobolev regularizer, we obtain a continuous version of the fusedmax. Finally,
we introduce continuous-domain attention mechanisms, deriving efficient
gradient backpropagation algorithms for $\alpha \in \{1, 4/3, 3/2, 2\}$. Using
these algorithms, we demonstrate our sparse continuous distributions for
attention-based audio classification and visual question answering, showing
that they allow attending to time intervals and compact regions.

$\Pi'$ is solvable in $t-1$ rounds. The theorem applies to the anonymous
variant of the LOCAL model, in graphs with sufficiently large girth, and to
locally checkable labeling (LCL) tasks. In this paper, using combinatorial
topology applied to distributed computing, we dissect the construction in
Brandt's speedup theorem for expressing it in the broader framework of
round-based models supporting full information protocols, which includes models
as different as wait-free shared-memory computing with iterated immediate
snapshots, and synchronous failure-free network computing. In particular, we
provide general definitions for notions such as local checkability and local
independence, in our broader framework. In this way, we are able to identify
the hypotheses on the computing model, and on the tasks, that are sufficient
for Brandt's speedup theorem to apply. More precisely, we identify which
hypotheses are sufficient for the each direction of the if-and-only-if
condition. Interestingly, these hypotheses are of different natures. Our
general approach enables to extend Brandt's speedup theorem from LOCAL to
directed networks, to hypergraphs, to dynamic networks, and even to graphs
including short cyclic dependencies between processes (i.e., the large girth
condition is, to some extend, not necessary). The theorem can even be extended
to shared-memory wait-free computing. In particular, we provide new
impossibility proofs for consensus and perfect renaming in 2-process systems.

examples. Applications of ML to voice biometrics authentication are no
exception. Yet, the implications of audio adversarial examples on these
real-world systems remain poorly understood given that most research targets
limited defenders who can only listen to the audio samples. Conflating
detectability of an attack with human perceptibility, research has focused on
methods that aim to produce imperceptible adversarial examples which humans
cannot distinguish from the corresponding benign samples. We argue that this
perspective is coarse for two reasons: 1. Imperceptibility is impossible to
verify; it would require an experimental process that encompasses variations in
listener training, equipment, volume, ear sensitivity, types of background
noise etc, and 2. It disregards pipeline-based detection clues that realistic
defenders leverage. This results in adversarial examples that are ineffective
in the presence of knowledgeable defenders. Thus, an adversary only needs an
audio sample to be plausible to a human. We thus introduce surreptitious
adversarial examples, a new class of attacks that evades both human and
pipeline controls. In the white-box setting, we instantiate this class with a
joint, multi-stage optimization attack. Using an Amazon Mechanical Turk user
study, we show that this attack produces audio samples that are more
surreptitious than previous attacks that aim solely for imperceptibility.
Lastly we show that surreptitious adversarial examples are challenging to
develop in the black-box setting.

observations towards the supernova remnant (SNR) LMC N132D that were
accumulated between December 2004 and March 2016 during a deep survey of the
Large Magellanic Cloud, adding 104 hours of observations to the previously
published data set to ensure a > 5 sigma detection. To broaden the gamma-ray
spectral coverage required for modeling the spectral energy distribution, an
analysis of Fermi-LAT Pass 8 data was also included. We unambiguously detect
N132D at very high energies (VHE) with a significance of 5.7 sigma. We report
the results of a detailed analysis of its spectrum and localization based on
the extended H.E.S.S. data set. The joint analysis of the extended H.E.S.S and
Fermi-LAT data results in a spectral energy distribution in the energy range
from 1.7 GeV to 14.8 TeV, which suggests a high luminosity of N132D at GeV and
TeV energies. We set a lower limit on a gamma-ray cutoff energy of 8 TeV with a
confidence level of 95%. The new gamma-ray spectrum as well as multiwavelength
observations of N132D when compared to physical models suggests a hadronic
origin of the VHE gamma-ray emission. SNR N132D is a VHE gamma-ray source that
shows a spectrum extending to the VHE domain without a spectral cutoff at a few
TeV, unlike the younger oxygen-rich SNR Cassiopeia A. The gamma-ray properties
of N132D may be affected by an interaction with a nearby molecular cloud that
partially lies inside the 95% confidence region of the source position.

Kawasaki dynamics for the two-dimensional Ising lattice gas at very low
temperature with periodic boundary conditions. Let $\beta>0$ be the inverse
temperature and let $\Lambda\subset\Lambda^\beta\subset\mathbb{Z}^2$ be two
boxes. We consider the asymptotic regime corresponding to the limit as
$\beta\rightarrow\infty$ for finite volume $\Lambda$ and
$\lim_{\beta\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{\beta}\log|\Lambda^\beta|=\infty$. We
study the simplified model, in which particles perform independent random walks
on $\Lambda^\beta\setminus\Lambda$ and inside $\Lambda$ particles perform
simple exclusion, but when they occupy neighboring sites they feel a binding
energy $-U_1<0$ in the horizontal direction and $-U_2<0$ in the vertical one.
Thus the Kawasaki dynamics is conservative inside the volume $\Lambda^\beta$.
The initial configuration is chosen such that $\Lambda$ is empty and
$\rho|\Lambda^\beta|$ particles are distributed randomly over
$\Lambda^\beta\setminus\Lambda$. Our results will use a deep analysis of a
local model, i.e., particles perform Kawasaki dynamics inside $\Lambda$ and
along each bond touching the boundary of $\Lambda$ from the outside to the
inside, particles are created with rate $\rho=e^{-\Delta\beta}$, while along
each bond from the inside to the outside, particles are annihilated with rate
$1$, where $\Delta>0$ is an activity parameter. Thus, in the local model the
boundary of $\Lambda$ plays the role of an infinite gas reservoir with density
$\rho$. We take $\Delta\in{(U_1,U_1+U_2)}$, so that the empty (respectively
full) configuration is a metastable (respectively stable) configuration. We
investigate how the transition from empty to full takes place in the local
model with particular attention to the critical configurations that
asymptotically have to be crossed with probability 1.

wireless communications. Indeed, a tag can send a message to a reader without

generated by a source. In the simplest implementation of such a system, the tag
sends a binary message by oscillating between two states and the reader detects
the bits by comparing the two distinct received powers. In this paper, for the
first time, we propose to study an ambient backscatter communication system, in
the presence of a diffusing surface, a simple flat panel that diffuses in all

contrast in the presence of the surface. We show that the diffusing surface
improves the power contrast. Moreover our approach allows us to express the
contrast to noise ratio, and therefore to establish the BER performance.
Furthermore, we derive the optimum source transmit power for a given target

can be saved at the source side, thanks to the diffusing surface.

photonics-based quantum technologies. Recently, the highly bright and versatile
SPEs from the two-dimensional insulator material hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)
have attracted significant research interest. However, due to the variability
of emitter species and properties, an exact correlation between the underlying
atomistic structures and their photo-physical properties is still lacking. In
this work, we study six boron vacancy-derived defect centers in hBN ($V_B^-$,
$V_B$+$H$, $V_{B2}$, $V_BC_N$, $V_BC_N^-$, and $V_BC_NC_N$) using advanced
first principles techniques, characterizing their quasiparticle defect levels,
optical spectra and excitation energies, and magneto-resonance properties.
These defects have been chosen because of their relatively low formation
energies, and, importantly, because they are amenable to intentional creation
under experimental conditions. We establish the correlation between the
underlying defect atomic structure and their photo-physical properties, thus
facilitating the identification of SPEs that have already been observed in
experiments. Our results lead to clear insights into very recent experiments
where hBN SPEs can be controlled intentionally. On the other hand, our results
also serve as guidelines for the bottom-up design of defect emitter centers in
hBN for target applications that require specific defect properties, such as
emission in the telecom wavelength, optical addressability and high radiative
decay rates. This work thus provides a comprehensive understanding of the
photo-physical characteristics of $V_B$-derived defect emitting centers, aiding
in their identification and manipulation for tailored applications.

event-driven activation and bio-inspired learning algorithms. SNN-based
machine-learning programs are typically executed on tile- based neuromorphic
hardware platforms, where each tile consists of a computation unit called
crossbar, which maps neurons and synapses of the program. However, synthesizing
such programs on an off-the-shelf neuromorphic hardware is challenging. This is
because of the inherent resource and latency limitations of the hardware, which
impact both model performance, e.g., accuracy, and hardware performance, e.g.,
throughput. We propose DFSynthesizer, an end-to-end framework for synthesizing
SNN-based machine learning programs to neuromorphic hardware. The proposed
framework works in four steps. First, it analyzes a machine-learning program
and generates SNN workload using representative data. Second, it partitions the
SNN workload and generates clusters that fit on crossbars of the target
neuromorphic hardware. Third, it exploits the rich semantics of Synchronous
Dataflow Graph (SDFG) to represent a clustered SNN program, allowing for
performance analysis in terms of key hardware constraints such as number of
crossbars, dimension of each crossbar, buffer space on tiles, and tile
communication bandwidth. Finally, it uses a novel scheduling algorithm to
execute clusters on crossbars of the hardware, guaranteeing hardware
performance. We evaluate DFSynthesizer with 10 commonly used machine-learning
programs. Our results demonstrate that DFSynthesizer provides much tighter
performance guarantee compared to current mapping approaches.

state-of-the-art systems generally degrades. As a consequence, robustness and
accuracy for monocular VSLAM are still widely concerned. This paper presents a
monocular VSLAM system that fully exploits learnt features for better state

embeddings at different modules of the system: direct camera pose estimation,
inter-frame feature association, and loop closure detection. With a
probabilistic explanation of keypoint prediction, we formulate the camera pose
tracking in a direct manner and parameterize local features with uncertainty
taken into account. To alleviate the quantization effect, we adapt the mapping
module to generate 3D landmarks better to guarantee the system's robustness.
Detecting temporal loop closure via deep global embeddings further improves the
robustness and accuracy of the proposed system. The proposed system is
extensively evaluated on public datasets (Tsukuba, EuRoC, and KITTI), and

are resilient to the failure of their elements, such as nodes or links. One
such problem is Connectivity Augmentation, where the goal is to cheaply
increase the connectivity of a network from a value k to k+1.
  The most studied setting focuses on edge-connectivity, which reduces to k=2,
called Cactus Augmentation. From an approximation perspective, Byrka, Grandoni,
and Jabal Ameli (2020) were the first to break the 2-approximation barrier for
this problem, by exploiting a connection to the Steiner Tree problem, and by
tailoring the analysis of the iterative randomized rounding technique for
Steiner Tree to the specific instances arising from this connection. Recently,
Nutov (2020) observed that a similar reduction to Steiner Tree holds for a
node-connectivity problem called Block-Tree Augmentation, where the goal is to
add edges to a given spanning tree so that the resulting graph
2-node-connected. Combining Nutov's result with the algorithm of Byrka,
Grandoni, and Jabal Ameli yields a 1.91-approximation for Block-Tree
Augmentation, that is the best bound known so far.
  In this work, we give a 1.892-approximation algorithm for the problem of
augmenting the node-connectivity of any graph from 1 to 2. As a corollary, we
improve upon the state-of-the-art approximation factor for Block-Tree
Augmentation. Our result is obtained by developing a different and simpler
analysis of the iterative randomized rounding technique. Our results also imply
a 1.892-approximation algorithm for Cactus Augmentation. While this does not
beat the best approximation by Cecchetto, Traub, and Zenklusen (2021) known for
this problem, our analysis is quite simple compared to previous results in the
literature. In addition, our work gives new insights on the iterative
randomized rounding method, that might be of independent interest.

and methods of software development are evolving rapidly, a problem has arisen:
programmers can no longer detect all the security flaws and vulnerabilities in
their code manually. To overcome this problem, developers can now rely on
automatic techniques, like machine learning based prediction models, to detect
such issues. An inherent property of such approaches is that they work with
numeric vectors (i.e., feature vectors) as inputs. Therefore, one needs to
transform the source code into such feature vectors, often referred to as code
embedding. A popular approach for code embedding is to adapt natural language
processing techniques, like text representation, to automatically derive the
necessary features from the source code. However, the suitability and
comparison of different text representation techniques for solving Software
Engineering (SE) problems is rarely studied systematically. In this paper, we
present a comparative study on three popular text representation methods,
word2vec, fastText, and BERT applied to the SE task of detecting
vulnerabilities in Python code. Using a data mining approach, we collected a

previous works only employ news articles at the coarse article or sentence

Information Concentrated Entity-aware news image CAPtioning (ICECAP) model,
which progressively concentrates on relevant textual information within the

first creates coarse concentration on relevant sentences using a cross-modality

relevant words within the sentences. Extensive experiments on both BreakingNews

a central role in diverse energy, environmental, and industrial processes.
While this process is typically studied in homogeneous porous media with
uniform permeabilities, in many cases, the media have multiple parallel strata
of different permeabilities. How such stratification impacts the fluid dynamics
of imbibition, as well as the fluid saturation after the wetting fluid breaks
through to the end of a given medium, is poorly understood. We address this gap
in knowledge by developing an analytical model of imbibition in a porous medium
with two parallel strata, combined with a pore network model that explicitly
describes fluid crossflow between the strata. By numerically solving these
models, we examine the fluid dynamics and fluid saturation left after
breakthrough. We find that the breakthrough saturation of nonwetting fluid is
minimized when the imposed capillary number Ca is tuned to a value Ca$^*$ that
depends on both the structure of the medium and the viscosity ratio between the
two fluids. Our results thus provide quantitative guidelines for predicting and
controlling flow in stratified porous media, with implications for water
remediation, oil/gas recovery, and applications requiring moisture management

magnetic field lines. In this model, the plasma is sliced into sub-volumes
separated by ideal interfaces, and in each volume the magnetic field is a
Beltrami field. In the cases where the system is far from possessing a
continuous symmetry, such as in stellarators, the existence of solutions to a
stepped-pressure equilibrium with given constraints, such as a multi-region
relaxed MHD minimum energy state, is not guaranteed but is often taken for
granted. Using SPEC, we have studied two different scenarios in which a
solution fails to exist in a slab with analytic boundary perturbations. We
found that with a large boundary perturbation, a certain interface becomes
fractal, corresponding to the break up of a Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM)
surface. Moreover, an interface can only support a maximum pressure jump while
a solution of the magnetic field consistent with the force balance condition
can be found. An interface closer to break-up can support a smaller pressure
jump. We discovered that the pressure jump can push the interface closer to
being non-smooth through force balance, thus significantly decreasing the
maximum pressure it can support. Our work shows that a convergence study must
be performed on a SPEC equilibrium with interfaces close to break-up. These

commonly found in water, air, and other planetary environments. The growth of
barchans results from the interplay between a fluid flow and a granular bed,
but their size regulation involves intricate exchanges between different
barchans within a field. One size-regulating mechanism is the binary
interaction between nearby dunes, when two dunes exchange mass via the near
flow field or by direct contact (collision). In a recent Letter (Assis and
Franklin, Geophys. Res. Lett., 2020), we identified five different patterns
arising from binary interactions of subaqueous barchans, and proposed
classification maps. In this paper, we further inquire into binary exchanges by
investigating the motion of individual grains while barchans interact with each
other. The experiments were conducted in a water channel where the evolution of
pairs of barchans in both aligned and off-centered configurations was recorded
by conventional and high-speed cameras. Based on image processing, we obtained
the morphology of dunes and motion of grains for all interaction patterns. We
present the trajectories of individual grains, from which we show the origin
and destination of moving grains, and their typical lengths and velocities. We
also show that grains from the impacting dune spread with a diffusion-like
component over the target barchan, and we propose a diffusion length. Our
results provide new insights into the size-regulating mechanisms of barchans

easier to recognise than unexpected words, particularly in noisy environments,
and incorrect expectations can make us misunderstand our conversational
partner. Expectations are combined with the output from the sensory pathways to
form representations of speech in the cerebral cortex. However, it is unclear
whether expectations are propagated further down to subcortical structures to
aid the encoding of the basic dynamic constituent of speech: fast
frequency-modulation (FM). Fast FM-sweeps are the basic invariant constituent
of consonants, and their correct encoding is fundamental for speech
recognition. Here we tested the hypothesis that subjective expectations drive
the encoding of fast FM-sweeps characteristic of speech in the human
subcortical auditory pathway. We used fMRI to measure neural responses in the
human auditory midbrain (inferior colliculus) and thalamus (medial geniculate
body). Participants listened to sequences of FM-sweeps for which they held
different expectations based on the task instructions. We found robust evidence
that the responses in auditory midbrain and thalamus encode the difference
between the acoustic input and the subjective expectations of the listener. The
results indicate that FM-sweeps are already encoded at the level of the human
auditory midbrain and that encoding is mainly driven by subjective
expectations. We conclude that the subcortical auditory pathway is integrated
in the cortical network of predictive speech processing and that expectations
are used to optimise the encoding of even the most basic acoustic constituents
of speech.

AlMo$_{0.5}$NbTa$_{0.5}$TiZr, shows an interesting microstructure with cuboidal
precipitates of a disordered phase (${\beta}$, bcc) coherently embedded in an
ordered phase (${\beta}'$, B2) matrix, unlike the conventional Ni-based
superalloys where the ordered phase (${\gamma}'$, L12) is the precipitate phase
and the disordered phase (${\gamma}$, fcc) is the matrix phase. It becomes
critical to understand the phase transformation pathway (PTP) leading to this
microstructure in order to tailor the microstructure for specific engineering
applications. In this study, we first propose a possible PTP leading to the
microstructure and employ the phase-field method to simulate microstructural
evolution along the PTP. We then explore possible PTPs and materials parameters
that lead to an inverted microstructure with the ordered phase being the
precipitate phase and the disordered phase being the matrix phase, a
microstructure similar to those observed in Ni-based superalloys. We find that
in order to maintain the precipitates as highly discrete particles along these
PTPs, the volume fraction of the precipitate phase needs to be smaller than
that of the matrix phase and the elastic stiffness of the precipitate phase
should be higher than that of the matrix phase.

the stochastic subgradient descent (SGD) to the critical points recently called
active strict saddles by Davis and Drusvyatskiy. Such points lie on a manifold
$M$ where the function $f$ has a direction of second-order negative curvature.
Off this manifold, the norm of the Clarke subdifferential of $f$ is
lower-bounded. We require two conditions on $f$. The first assumption is a
Verdier stratification condition, which is a refinement of the popular Whitney
stratification. It allows us to establish a reinforced version of the
projection formula of Bolte \emph{et.al.} for Whitney stratifiable functions,
and which is of independent interest. The second assumption, termed the angle
condition, allows to control the distance of the iterates to $M$. When $f$ is
weakly convex, our assumptions are generic. Consequently, generically in the
class of definable weakly convex functions, the SGD converges to a local
minimizer.

that the tuning techniques can significantly reduce the ANN hardware complexity

Different researchers motivated the transfer of these benefits into crowd-based
RE (CrowdRE) by using vision videos on social media platforms. So far, however,
little research explored the potential of using vision videos for CrowdRE in
detail. In this paper, we analyze and assess this potential, in particular,
focusing on video comments as a source of feedback. In a case study, we
analyzed 4505 comments on a vision video from YouTube. We found that the video
solicited 2770 comments from 2660 viewers in four days. This is more than 50%
of all comments the video received in four years. Even though only a certain
fraction of these comments are relevant to RE, the relevant comments address
typical intentions and topics of user feedback, such as feature request or
problem report. Besides the typical user feedback categories, we found more
than 300 comments that address the topic safety, which has not appeared in
previous analyses of user feedback. In an automated analysis, we compared the
performance of three machine learning algorithms on classifying the video
comments. Despite certain differences, the algorithms classified the video
comments well. Based on these findings, we conclude that the use of vision
videos for CrowdRE has a large potential. Despite the preliminary nature of the

Networks, once trained, are able to make highly accurate predictions at a

of labelled experiments to train the model. In scenarios where data is scarce

an active learning scheme that can reduce the amount of labelled data required,

We present a scheme for coupling a graph neural network with a Gaussian process
to featurise solid-state materials and predict properties \textit{including} a
measure of confidence in the prediction. We then demonstrate that this scheme
can be used in an active learning context to speed up the training of the

active learning scheme can double the rate at which the performance of the
model on a test data set improves with additional data compared to choosing the

fault-tolerantly implementing quantum circuits. We choose the $[[4, 1, 2]]$
Bacon-Shor subsystem code, which has a particularly simple error-detection

pseudo-thresholds for the Pauli error rate $p$ in a depolarizing noise model,
below which the encoded circuits outperform the unencoded circuits. These
pseudo-threshold values are shown to be as high as $p=3\%$ for short circuits,
and $p=0.6\%$ for circuits of moderate depth. Additionally, we see that
multiple rounds of stabilizer measurements give an improvement over performing

user-independent public knowledge (e.g., business locations and opening times,

mechanisms too restrictive, gives unrealistic outputs, and ultimately leads to
low practical utility. To address these concerns, we propose a local
differentially private mechanism that is based on perturbing
hierarchically-structured, overlapping $n$-grams (i.e., contiguous subsequences

hierarchy over publicly available external knowledge of real-world places of

second, network-based approach incorporates public geographic information, such
as the road network of a city, to constrain the bounds of synthetic data points

requirements of differential privacy, while also enabling accurate generation
of synthetic data that aims to preserve the distribution of the real locations.
We conduct experiments using three large-scale location datasets to show that
the proposed solutions generate synthetic location data with high utility and
strong similarity to the real datasets. We highlight some practical

and empirically that Edge PageRank, an algebraic topological measure originally
defined as an extension of the classical PageRank measure, is a valid
continuous measure of how well a relationship acts as a bridge. Second, we use
the tool of Hodge Decomposition, which allows us to decompose any flow in a
simplicial complex into three orthogonal components, to clarify the
relationship between dyadic tie strength and network structure. We find that
individuals invest less in relationships associated with topological holes in
the network, replicating and explaining recent empirical results that bridging
relationships spanning short network distances tend to be weak, whereas those
spanning longer distances are strong. Our results are validated on 15 large

computational resources for accurate predictions. One promising technique to
obtain an accurate yet lightweight pose estimator is knowledge distillation,
which distills the pose knowledge from a powerful teacher model to a
less-parameterized student model. However, existing pose distillation works
rely on a heavy pre-trained estimator to perform knowledge transfer and require
a complex two-stage learning procedure. In this work, we investigate a novel
Online Knowledge Distillation framework by distilling Human Pose structure
knowledge in a one-stage manner to guarantee the distillation efficiency,
termed OKDHP. Specifically, OKDHP trains a single multi-branch network and
acquires the predicted heatmaps from each, which are then assembled by a
Feature Aggregation Unit (FAU) as the target heatmaps to teach each branch in
reverse. Instead of simply averaging the heatmaps, FAU which consists of
multiple parallel transformations with different receptive fields, leverages
the multi-scale information, thus obtains target heatmaps with higher-quality.
Specifically, the pixel-wise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is utilized to
minimize the discrepancy between the target heatmaps and the predicted ones,
which enables the student network to learn the implicit keypoint relationship.
Besides, an unbalanced OKDHP scheme is introduced to customize the student
networks with different compression rates. The effectiveness of our approach is
demonstrated by extensive experiments on two common benchmark datasets, MPII
and COCO.

Constructing a high-quality co-saliency detection dataset involves
time-consuming and labor-intensive pixel-level labeling, which has forced most
recent works to rely instead on semantic segmentation or saliency detection
datasets for training. However, the lack of proper co-saliency and the absence
of multiple foreground objects in these datasets can lead to spurious
variations and inherent biases learned by models. To tackle this, we introduce
the idea of counterfactual training through context adjustment and propose a
""cost-free"" group-cut-paste (GCP) procedure to leverage off-the-shelf images
and synthesize new samples. Following GCP, we collect a novel dataset called
Context Adjustment Training (CAT). CAT consists of 33,500 images, which is four
times larger than the current co-saliency detection datasets. All samples are
automatically annotated with high-quality mask annotations, object categories,

Here, setting a quantum vortex into directional motion in an open-dissipative
fluid of microcavity polaritons, we observe the self-splitting of the packet,
leading to the trembling movement of its center of mass, whereas the vortex
core undergoes ultrafast spiraling along diverging and converging circles, in a
sub-picosecond precessing fashion. This singular dynamics is accompanied by
vortex-antivortex pairs creation and annihilation, and a periodically changing

to be rotating and splitting itself. Its reshaping is due to three simultaneous
drives along the distinct directions of momentum and complex frequency, by
means of the differential group velocities, Rabi frequency and dissipation

restricted to the CNOT or CZ gate set. In this work, we develop a compiler,
named 2QAN, to optimize quantum circuits for 2-local qubit Hamiltonian
simulation problems, a framework which includes the important quantum
approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). In particular, we exploit the
flexibility of permuting different operators in the Hamiltonian (no matter

2QAN can target different qubit topologies and different hardware gate sets.
Compilation results on four applications (up to 50 qubits) and three quantum

2QAN outperforms state-of-the-art general-purpose compilers and

compress the gradient during communication. However, directly compressing the

diverge for biased compression. Recent work addressed this problem for
stochastic gradient descent by adding back the compression error from the
previous step. This idea was further extended to one class of variance reduced
algorithms, where the variance of the stochastic gradient is reduced by taking
a moving average over all history gradients. However, our analysis shows that
just adding the previous step's compression error, as done in existing work,
does not fully compensate the compression error. So, we propose
ErrorCompensatedX, which uses the compression error from the previous two
steps. We show that ErrorCompensatedX can achieve the same asymptotic
convergence rate with the training without compression. Moreover, we provide a

the nature of the variability of pre-main sequence (PMS) stars. We have

Forty-five of the PMS variables are showing periodicity in their light curves.
We show that the stars with thicker discs and envelopes rotate slower and
exhibit larger photometric variations compared to their disc-less counterparts.
This result suggests that rotation of the PMS stars is regulated by the
presence of circumstellar discs. We also found that the period of the stars
show a decreasing trend with increasing mass in the range of $\sim$0.5-2.5
M$_\odot$. Our result indicates that most of the variability in Class II
sources is ascribed to the presence of thick disc, while the presence of cool
spots on the stellar surface causes the brightness variation in Class III
sources. X-ray activities in the PMS stars were found to be at the saturation
level reported for the main sequence (MS) stars. The younger counterparts of
the PMS variables are showing less X-ray activity hinting towards a less

high-quality videos from low-quality compressed ones. Among them, some restore
the missing details of each frame via exploring the spatiotemporal information
of neighboring frames. However, these methods usually suffer from a narrow
temporal scope, thus may miss some useful details from some frames outside the
neighboring ones. In this paper, to boost artifact removal, on the one hand, we
propose a Recursive Fusion (RF) module to model the temporal dependency within
a long temporal range. Specifically, RF utilizes both the current reference
frames and the preceding hidden state to conduct better spatiotemporal
compensation. On the other hand, we design an efficient and effective
Deformable Spatiotemporal Attention (DSTA) module such that the model can pay
more effort on restoring the artifact-rich areas like the boundary area of a
moving object. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the
existing ones on the MFQE 2.0 dataset in terms of both fidelity and perceptual

surfaces and one topological curve, which lead to an eigenvalue space based on
the tensor mode that we define. In addition, we identify several
non-topological feature surfaces that are nonetheless physically important.
Included in our analysis are the realizations that triple degenerate tensors
are structurally stable and form curves, unlike the case for 3D symmetric
tensors fields. Furthermore, there are two different ways of measuring the
relative strengths of rotation and angular deformation in the tensor fields,
unlike the case for 2D asymmetric tensor fields. We extract these feature
surfaces using the A-patches algorithm. However, since three of our feature
surfaces are quadratic, we develop a method to extract quadratic surfaces at
any given accuracy. To facilitate the analysis of eigenvector fields, we
visualize a hyperstreamline as a tree stem with the other two eigenvectors
represented as thorns in the real domain or the dual-eigenvectors as leaves in
the complex domain. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our analysis and
visualization, we apply our approach to datasets from solid mechanics and fluid

its dual. Conserved currents associated with the gauge and duality symmetries

task that requires a specific series of actions due to sparse rewards. To solve
this problem, reverse curriculum generation (RCG) provides a reverse expansion
approach that automatically generates a curriculum for the agent to learn. More
specifically, RCG adapts the initial state distribution from the neighborhood
of a goal to a distance as training proceeds. However, the initial state
distribution generated for each iteration might be biased, thus making the
policy overfit or slowing down the reverse expansion rate. While training RCG
for actor-critic (AC) based RL algorithms, this poor generalization and slow
convergence might be induced by the tight coupling between an AC pair.
Therefore, we propose a parallelized approach that simultaneously trains
multiple AC pairs and periodically exchanges their critics. We empirically
demonstrate that this proposed approach can improve RCG in performance and

However, existing methods more or less rely on some assumptions on the signal

construct an optimal criterion for unsupervised denoising learning without any
prior knowledge on the degradation model is still an open question. Toward
answering this question, this work proposes a criterion for unsupervised
denoising learning based on the optimal transport theory. This criterion has
favorable properties, e.g., approximately maximal preservation of the
information of the signal, whilst achieving perceptual reconstruction.
Furthermore, though a relaxed unconstrained formulation is used in practical
implementation, we prove that the relaxed formulation in theory has the same
solution as the original constrained formulation. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world data, including realistic photographic, microscopy, depth, and raw
depth images, demonstrate that the proposed method even compares favorably with
supervised methods, e.g., approaching the PSNR of supervised methods while
having better perceptual quality. Particularly, for spatially correlated noise
and realistic microscopy images, the proposed method not only achieves better
perceptual quality but also has higher PSNR than supervised methods. Besides,
it shows remarkable superiority in harsh practical conditions with complex

way public contracting is done, and thus, in the levels and types of corruption
involved in public procurement. In this respect, M\'exico lived a historical

that have now been identified as being involved in corrupt practices. We find
that while the amount of resources spent with companies that turned out to be

measurement matrix that preserves the compressed information at the maximum
level, and finding a reconstruction algorithm for the compressed information.
In the traditional CS setup, the measurement matrices are selected as random
matrices, and optimization-based iterative solutions are used to recover the
signals. However, when we handle large signals, using random matrices become
cumbersome especially when it comes to iterative optimization-based solutions.
Even though recent deep learning-based solutions boost the reconstruction
accuracy performance while speeding up the recovery, still jointly learning the
whole measurement matrix is a difficult process. In this work, we introduce a
separable multi-linear learning of the CS matrix by representing it as the
summation of arbitrary number of tensors. For a special case where the CS
operation is set as a single tensor multiplication, the model is reduced to the
learning-based separable CS; while a dense CS matrix can be approximated and
learned as the summation of multiple tensors. Both cases can be used in CS of
two or multi-dimensional signals e.g., images, multi-spectral images, videos,
etc. Structural CS matrices can also be easily approximated and learned in our
multi-linear separable learning setup with structural tensor sum
representation. Hence, our learnable generalized tensor summation CS operation
encapsulates most CS setups including separable CS, non-separable CS
(traditional vector-matrix multiplication), structural CS, and CS of the
multi-dimensional signals. For both gray-scale and RGB images, the proposed
scheme surpasses most state-of-the-art solutions, especially in lower
measurement rates. Although the performance gain remains limited from tensor to
the sum of tensor representation for gray-scale images, it becomes significant
in the RGB case.

limitations in accounting for the uncertainty, unpredictability, and dynamic

embed lengthscales in their definition. However, the integrands in these
operators are difficult to define from the data that are typically available
for a given physical system, such as laboratory mechanical property tests. In
contrast, molecular dynamics (MD) does not require these integrands, but it
suffers from computational limitations in the length and time scales it can
address. To combine the strengths of both methods and to obtain a
coarse-grained, homogenized continuum model that efficiently and accurately
captures materials' behavior, we propose a learning framework to extract, from
MD data, an optimal Linear Peridynamic Solid (LPS) model as a surrogate for MD
displacements. To maximize the accuracy of the learnt model we allow the
peridynamic influence function to be partially negative, while preserving the
well-posedness of the resulting model. To achieve this, we provide sufficient
well-posedness conditions for discretized LPS models with sign-changing
influence functions and develop a constrained optimization algorithm that
minimizes the equation residual while enforcing such solvability conditions.
This framework guarantees that the resulting model is mathematically
well-posed, physically consistent, and that it generalizes well to settings
that are different from the ones used during training. We illustrate the
efficacy of the proposed approach with several numerical tests for single layer
graphene. Our two-dimensional tests show the robustness of the proposed

longitudinal (dissipative) radiation term that appears instantaneously with
acceleration, leading to the prediction that radiation from a betatron (of any
frequency) will not produce photoelectrons. A major outcome is the dual
unification of Newtonian mechanics and classical electrodynamics with
Einstein's special theory of relativity, without a self-energy divergency, or
need of the problematic Lorentz-Dirac equation or any assumptions about the
size or structure of a particle. The purpose of this paper is to introduce and
develop the dual theory of relativistic quantum mechanics. We obtain three
distinct dual relativistic wave equations that reduce to the Schr{\""o}dinger
equation when minimal coupling is turned off. We show that the dual Dirac
equation provides a new formula for the anomalous magnetic moment of a charged
particle. We can obtain the exact value for the electron g-factor and
phenomenological values for the muon and proton g-factors.

been enabled by the introduction of bianisotropic metasurfaces. A bianisotropic
metasurface is characterized by an electric response, a magnetic response, and
an electromagnetic/magnetoelectric response. In general, these metasur-faces
consists of an array of metallic or dielectric particles located within a
subwavelength thick host medium, and are approximated and modelled as
infinitely-thin, idealized sheet boundaries defined along a surface. An
appropriate sheet boundary condition which effectively models the tangential
field discontinuity due to the array of magnetoelectric inclusions is the
Generalized Sheet Transition Condition or GSTC. Several forms of the GSTC
appear in literature. Here, we present each interpretation and show how they
are related. Synthesis approaches unique to each form are overviewed. By
utilizing the GSTC in metasurface design, new possibilities emerge which are
not possible with conventional design techniques incorporating only electric or
only magnetic responses. Since the metasurfaces are designed using
bianisotropic boundary conditions, they must be realized using particles which
contain magnetoelectric responses. This review article discusses the design of
metasurfaces using the GSTC, and the bianisotropic particles used to realize
GSTCs. Further, it discusses new and recent applications that have emerged due
to bianisotropy, and future prospects in metasurface design using bianisotropic

the first predictions of the model for the spatial variation of the SED in the

real attacks hidden among feints. This work aims to formally define IDoS
attacks, quantify their consequences, and develop human-assistive security
technologies to mitigate the severity level and risks of IDoS attacks. To this
end, we use the semi-Markov process to model the sequential arrivals of feints
and real attacks with category labels attached in the associated alerts. The
assistive technology strategically manages human attention by highlighting
selective alerts periodically to prevent the distraction of other alerts. A
data-driven approach is applied to evaluate human performance under different
Attention Management (AM) strategies. Under a representative special case, we
establish the computational equivalency between two dynamic programming
representations to reduce the computation complexity and enable online learning
with samples of reduced size and zero delays. A case study corroborates the
effectiveness of the learning framework. The numerical results illustrate how
AM strategies can alleviate the severity level and the risk of IDoS attacks.

level of intentional inattention to alerts, which we refer to as the law of
rational risk-reduction inattention.

graph neural networks (GNNs) is adopted in order to efficiently parametrize the
power control policy mapping the channel state information (CSI) to transmit
powers. The specific GNN architecture, known as random edge GNN (REGNN),
defines a non-linear graph convolutional filter whose spatial weights are tied
to the channel coefficients. While prior work assumed a joint training approach
whereby the REGNN-based policy is shared across all topologies, this paper
targets adaptation of the power control policy based on limited CSI data
regarding the current topology. To this end, we propose a novel modular

assignment. While black-box meta-learning optimizes a general-purpose
adaptation procedure via (stochastic) gradient descent, modular meta-learning
finds a set of reusable modules that can form components of a solution for any

like its predecessor, conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), they
still have a common drawback: localized (fixed) kernel operations. This
severely limits the receptive field and information flow between layers and
thus brings the necessity for deep and complex models. It is highly desired to
improve the receptive field size without increasing the kernel dimensions. This
requires a significant upgrade over the generative neurons to achieve the
non-localized kernel operations for each connection between consecutive layers.
In this article, we present superior (generative) neuron models (or super
neurons in short) that allow random or learnable kernel shifts and thus can
increase the receptive field size of each connection. The kernel localization
process varies among the two super-neuron models. The first model assumes
randomly localized kernels within a range and the second one learns (optimizes)
the kernel locations during training. An extensive set of comparative
