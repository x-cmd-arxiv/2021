the uniform complete observability (UCO) of 6-DOF plant inertial parameters for
a stable adaptive identifier for this class of systems. When the UCO condition

convergence of adaptive parameter estimates to true parameter values.

that (a) the UCO condition can be met for fully-actuated plants as well as

photo-realistic high-resolution (HR) images from the low-resolution (LR) image
rather than learning a deterministic mapping. For image rescaling, it achieves
high accuracy by jointly modelling the downscaling and upscaling processes.
While existing approaches employ specialized techniques for these two tasks, we
set out to unify them in a single formulation. In this paper, we propose the
hierarchical conditional flow (HCFlow) as a unified framework for image SR and
image rescaling. More specifically, HCFlow learns a bijective mapping between
HR and LR image pairs by modelling the distribution of the LR image and the
rest high-frequency component simultaneously. In particular, the high-frequency
component is conditional on the LR image in a hierarchical manner. To further
enhance the performance, other losses such as perceptual loss and GAN loss are
combined with the commonly used negative log-likelihood loss in training.
Extensive experiments on general image SR, face image SR and image rescaling
have demonstrated that the proposed HCFlow achieves state-of-the-art
performance in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

variant due to factors such as object motion and out-of-focus. Hence, existing
blind SR methods would inevitably give rise to poor performance in real
applications. To address this issue, this paper proposes a mutual affine
network (MANet) for spatially variant kernel estimation. Specifically, MANet
has two distinctive features. First, it has a moderate receptive field so as to
keep the locality of degradation. Second, it involves a new mutual affine
convolution (MAConv) layer that enhances feature expressiveness without
increasing receptive field, model size and computation burden. This is made
possible through exploiting channel interdependence, which applies each channel
split with an affine transformation module whose input are the rest channel
splits. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real images show that the
proposed MANet not only performs favorably for both spatially variant and
invariant kernel estimation, but also leads to state-of-the-art blind SR
performance when combined with non-blind SR methods.

X-ray astronomical satellite, ""FORCE"". The XRPIX are fabricated with the SOI
technology, which makes it possible to integrate a high-resistivity Si sensor
and a low-resistivity Si CMOS circuit. The CMOS circuit in each pixel is
equipped with a trigger function, allowing us to read out outputs only from the
pixels with X-ray signals at the timing of X-ray detection. This function thus
realizes high throughput and high time resolution, which enables to employ
anti-coincidence technique for background rejection. A new series of XRPIX
named XRPIX6E developed with a pinned depleted diode (PDD) structure improves
spectral performance by suppressing the interference between the sensor and
circuit layers. When semiconductor X-ray sensors are used in space, their
spectral performance is generally degraded owing to the radiation damage caused
by high-energy protons. Therefore, before using an XRPIX in space, it is
necessary to evaluate the extent of degradation of its spectral performance by
radiation damage. Thus, we performed a proton irradiation experiment for
XRPIX6E for the first time at HIMAC in the NIRS. We irradiated XRPIX6E with
high-energy protons with a total dose of up to 40 krad, equivalent to 400 years
of irradiation in orbit. The 40-krad irradiation degraded the energy resolution
of XRPIX6E by 25 $\pm$ 3%, yielding an energy resolution of 260.1 $\pm$ 5.6 eV
at the full width half maximum for 5.9 keV X-rays. However, the value satisfies
the requirement for FORCE, 300 eV at 6 keV, even after the irradiation. It was
also found that the PDD XRPIX has enhanced radiation hardness compared to
previous XRPIX devices. In addition, we investigated the degradation of the
energy resolution; it was shown that the degradation would be due to increasing
energy-independent components, e.g., readout noise.

up to pressures of $\sim2.5$ GPa and the superconducting transition temperature
$T_{\rm c}$ reaches a maximum at around 1 GPa, which is inconsistent with the
theoretical prediction. To understand its non-monotonic variation and
investigate superconductivity at higher pressures, we performed structural
analysis by x-ray diffraction at room temperature below 8 GPa and electrical
resistivity measurements at low temperatures from 1 to 8 GPa. With regard to
the superconductivity beyond 1 GPa, the monotonic decrease in $T_{\rm c}$ is
reproduced without any noticeable anomalies; $T_{\rm c}$ changes from 1.8 K at
1 GPa to 0.82 K at 5.5 GPa with $dT_{\rm c}/dP\sim-0.22$ K/GPa. The crystal
structure with spacegroup $P$\={3}$m$1 is stable in the pressure range we
examined. On the other hand, the normalized pressure-strain analysis (finite
strain analysis) indicates that the compressibility changes around 1 GPa,
suggesting that a Lifshitz transition occurs. We here discuss the effect of
pressure on the superconducting and structural properties based on the

researchers as they are not restricted to the spatial inductive bias of
ConvNets. However, although Transformer-based backbones have achieved much
progress on ImageNet classification, it is still unclear whether the learned
representations are as transferable as or even more transferable than ConvNets'
features. To address this point, we systematically investigate the transfer
learning ability of ConvNets and vision transformers in 15 single-task and
multi-task performance evaluations. Given the strong correlation between the
performance of pre-trained models and transfer learning, we include 2 residual
ConvNets (i.e., R-101x3 and R-152x4) and 3 Transformer-based visual backbones
(i.e., ViT-B, ViT-L and Swin-B), which have close error rates on ImageNet, that
indicate similar transfer learning performance on downstream datasets.
  We observe consistent advantages of Transformer-based backbones on 13
downstream tasks (out of 15), including but not limited to fine-grained
classification, scene recognition (classification, segmentation and depth
estimation), open-domain classification, face recognition, etc. More
specifically, we find that two ViT models heavily rely on whole network
fine-tuning to achieve performance gains while Swin Transformer does not have
such a requirement. Moreover, vision transformers behave more robustly in
multi-task learning, i.e., bringing more improvements when managing mutually
beneficial tasks and reducing performance losses when tackling irrelevant
tasks. We hope our discoveries can facilitate the exploration and exploitation
of vision transformers in the future.

compatible with the double peak solution of the $P_{cs}(4459)^0$ and with what

guaranteed either with respect to only the $H^1$--topology, in the case of
general observables, or to the analytic Gevrey topology, in the case of

stronger topologies, the framework of general interpolant observable operators,

class of operators. A significant effort is dedicated to the development of
this more expanded framework, specifically, their basic approximation
properties, the identification of subclasses of such operators relevant to
obtaining synchronization, as well as the detailed relation between the
structure of these operators and the system regarding the syncrhonization

which allows the observational data itself to dictate the subdivision of the
domain. Lastly, estimates for the radius of the absorbing ball of the 2D NSE in

derive several consequences for multi-loop integrals in general, and we
illustrate them on the example of multi-loop banana integrals. For example, we
show how Griffiths transversality, known from the theory of variation of mixed
Hodge structures, leads quite generically to a set of quadratic relations among
maximal cut integrals associated to Calabi-Yau motives. These quadratic
relations then naturally lead to a compact expression for $l$-loop banana
integrals in $D=2$ dimensions in terms of an integral over a period of a
Calabi-Yau $(l-1)$-fold. This new integral representation generalizes in a
natural way the known representations for $l\le 3$ involving logarithms with

lattice QCD and then combined with an analytic photon propagator, and the mass
splitting is calculated with exponentially-suppressed finite volume errors. The
calculation is performed using six gauge ensembles generated with $2+1$-flavor
domain wall fermions, and five ensembles are at the physical pion mass. Both
Feynman and Coulomb gauge are adopted in the calculation and result in a good
agreement when the lattice spacing approaches zero. After performing the

performance recently and it is of great importance to further understand the
interpretability of these networks. Existing methods attempt to provide posthoc
explanations by investigating visual cues, which may not explore the internal
representations learned by deep networks. In this paper, we find that some
hidden units of the network are selective to certain ranges of depth, and thus
such behavior can be served as a way to interpret the internal representations.
Based on our observations, we quantify the interpretability of a deep MDE
network by the depth selectivity of its hidden units. Moreover, we then propose
a method to train interpretable MDE deep networks without changing their
original architectures, by assigning a depth range for each unit to select.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method is able to enhance the
interpretability of deep MDE networks by largely improving the depth
selectivity of their units, while not harming or even improving the depth
estimation accuracy. We further provide a comprehensive analysis to show the
reliability of selective units, the applicability of our method on different
layers, models, and datasets, and a demonstration on analysis of model error.

criteria are satisfied through self-fulfilling prophecies. We provide concrete

parallel$-$serial structure contains a revolute segment with rigid links
connected by a passive revolute joint and actuated by a linear hydraulic
actuator, thus forming a closed kinematic loop. In addition, prismatic
segments, consisting of prismatic joints driven by hydraulic linear actuators,
also are considered. Expressions for actuator forces are derived using the
Newton$-$Euler (N$-$E) dynamics formulation. The derivation process does not
assume massless actuators decoupled from manipulator links, which is common in
the Lagrange dynamics formulation. Actuator pressure dynamics are included in
the analysis, leading in total to a third-order system of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs). The proposed model in the N$-$E framework, with fewer
parameters than its predecessors, inspires revision of the virtual
decomposition control (VDC) systematic process to formulate a control law based
on the new model. The virtual stability of each generic manipulator revolute
and prismatic segment is obtained, leading to the Lyapunov stability of the
entire robot.

Schwarzschild black hole can be obtained by solving the Wheeler-DeWitt
equation. What is of prime importance is the behavior of the wave function for
the future boundary near the singularity, and the DeWitt boundary condition
implies that it should vanish here. In this paper, we provide several
generalizations, and new interpretations, of the DeWitt boundary condition.
First, we summarize existing works on the wave function inside the black hole
to justify the DeWitt boundary condition. Next, we investigate the wave
function for the collapsing null shell to show that due to the reflection
symmetry in space and time, there exists a destructive interference near the
singularity and hence a vanishing boundary condition can be natural. If we
extend this point of view to the black hole spacetime itself, then the DeWitt
boundary condition is equivalent to saying that there exists a symmetric
anti-black hole contribution, such that eventually these two geometries are
annihilated-to-nothing near the quantum transition surface. This symmetric
model can be realized within black hole models of loop quantum gravity with a

related objects. When an object is a part of the group, its trajectory depends
on the trajectories of the other group members. Most of the current
state-of-the-art trackers follow the approach of tracking each object
independently, with the mechanism to handle the overlapping trajectories where
necessary. Such an approach does not take inter-object relations into account,
which may cause unreliable tracking for the members of the groups, especially
in crowded scenarios, where individual cues become unreliable due to
occlusions. To overcome these limitations and to extend such trackers to
crowded scenes, we propose a plug-in Relation Encoding Module (REM). REM
encodes relations between tracked objects by running a message passing over a
corresponding spatio-temporal graph, computing relation embeddings for the
tracked objects. Our experiments on MOT17 and MOT20 demonstrate that the
baseline tracker improves its results after a simple extension with REM. The
proposed module allows for tracking severely or even fully occluded objects by
utilizing relational cues.

27 sessions yields an INOV duty cycle of ~23% for the comparison sample of

sensitive test does not detect INOV for the sample of BAL_blazar candidates.
This stark INOV contrast found here between the BAL_blazar candidates and
normal blazars can probably be traced to a physical interaction of the
relativistic jet with the thermal wind, within sub-parsec range from the
nucleus. The consequent enfeebling of the jet would additionally explain the
striking deficiency among BAL quasars of powerful FR II radio lobes on the much
larger scale of 10-100 kpc.

attentions. Then, we merge local attentions and stack these merged attentions
with the residual connection as an attention pyramid. The proposed attention
pyramid is a lightweight plug-and-play module that can be applied to

of these approaches heavily depends on their used bug reports. A significant
number of bug reports contain only plain natural language texts. According to
existing studies, IR-based approaches cannot perform well when they use these
bug reports as search queries. On the other hand, there is a piece of recent
evidence that suggests that even these natural language-only reports contain
enough good keywords that could help localize the bugs successfully. On one
hand, these findings suggest that natural language-only bug reports might be a
sufficient source for good query keywords. On the other hand, they cast serious
doubt on the query selection practices in the IR-based bug localization. In
this article, we attempted to clear the sky on this aspect by conducting an
in-depth empirical study that critically examines the state-of-the-art query
selection practices in IR-based bug localization. In particular, we use a
dataset of 2,320 bug reports, employ ten existing approaches from the
literature, exploit the Genetic Algorithm-based approach to construct optimal,
near-optimal search queries from these bug reports, and then answer three
research questions. We confirmed that the state-of-the-art query construction
approaches are indeed not sufficient for constructing appropriate queries (for
bug localization) from certain natural language-only bug reports although they
contain such queries. We also demonstrate that optimal queries and non-optimal
queries chosen from bug report texts are significantly different in terms of
several keyword characteristics, which has led us to actionable insights.
Furthermore, we demonstrate 27%--34% improvement in the performance of
non-optimal queries through the application of our actionable insights to them.

of mass and the thermal history of our Universe. We show how collider
measurements and observations of stochastic gravitational wave signals can
complement each other to explore the multiform scalar potential in the two
Higgs doublet model (2HDM). Accounting for theoretical and current experimental
constraints, we analyze the key ingredients in the shape of the Higgs potential
triggering the transmutation in phase transition, from the smooth crossover to
the strong first-order phase transition ($\xi_c>1$), focusing on the barrier
formation and the upliftment of the true vacuum. In particular, we observe that
the $\xi_c>1$ regime is favored for lower scalar masses, rendering strong extra
motivation for collider searches. We contrast the dominant collider signals at
the HL-LHC (high-luminosity LHC) with observable gravitational wave signals at
LISA. We obtain that the HL-LHC will be able to cover a vast range of the
$\xi_c>1$ parameter space, with scalar decays to heavy fermions $(H,A,H^\pm\to
tt, tb)$ being the most promising smoking gun signature of a strong first-order
electroweak phase transition in the 2HDM.

from their host stars. For planets with primordial hydrogen and helium-rich
envelopes, this can lead to substantial mass loss. Direct observations of
atmospheric escape in young planetary systems can help elucidate this critical
stage of planetary evolution. In this work, we search for metastable helium
absorption---a tracer of tenuous gas in escaping atmospheres---during transits
of three planets orbiting the young solar analogue V1298 Tau. We characterize
the stellar helium line using HET/HPF, and find that it evolves substantially
on timescales of days to months. The line is stable on hour-long timescales
except for one set of spectra taken during the decay phase of a stellar flare,
where absoprtion increased with time. Utilizing a beam-shaping diffuser and a
narrowband filter centered on the helium feature, we observe four transits with
Palomar/WIRC: two partial transits of planet d ($P = 12.4$ days), one partial
transit of planet b ($P = 24.1$ days), and one full transit of planet c ($P =
8.2$ days). We do not detect the transit of planet c, and we find no evidence
of excess absorption for planet b, with $\Delta R_\mathrm{b}/R_\star<0.019$ in
our bandpass. We find a tentative absorption signal for planet d with $\Delta
R_\mathrm{d}/R_\star = 0.0205\pm0.054$, but the best-fit model requires a
substantial (-100$\pm$14 min) transit-timing offset on a two-month timescale.
Nevertheless, our data suggest that V1298 Tau d may have a high present-day
mass-loss rate, making it a priority target for follow-up observations.

that mergers are the dominant mechanism driving the growth of both galaxies and
supermassive black holes (SMBH), in favour of non-merger (secular) processes.
In this pilot study of merger-free SMBH and galaxy growth, we use Keck Cosmic
Web Imager spectral observations to examine four low-redshift ($0.043 < z <
0.073$) disk-dominated `bulgeless' galaxies hosting luminous AGN, assumed to be
merger-free. We detect blueshifted broadened [OIII] emission from outflows in
all four sources, which the \oiii/\hbeta~ratios reveal are ionised by the AGN.
We calculate outflow rates in the range $0.12-0.7~\rm{M}_{\odot}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$,
with velocities of $675-1710~\rm{km}~\rm{s}^{-1}$, large radial extents of
$0.6-2.4~\rm{kpc}$, and SMBH accretion rates of
$0.02-0.07~\rm{M}_{\odot}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$. We find that the outflow rates,
kinematics, and energy injection rates are typical of the wider population of
low-redshift AGN, and have velocities exceeding the galaxy escape velocity by a
factor of $\sim30$, suggesting that these outflows will have a substantial
impact through AGN feedback. Therefore, if both merger-driven and
non-merger-driven SMBH growth lead to co-evolution, this suggests that
co-evolution is regulated by feedback in both scenarios. Simulations find that
bars and spiral arms can drive inflows to galactic centres at rates an order of
magnitude larger than the combined SMBH accretion and outflow rates of our four
targets. This work therefore provides further evidence that non-merger
processes are sufficient to fuel SMBH growth and AGN outflows in disk galaxies.

with stellar population synthesis models that include the effects of stellar
binarity. Over the dynamic range of our sample, there is little variation in
stellar and nebular abundance with Lya equivalent width, W(Lya), and only a
marginal anti-correlation between age and W(Lya). The inferred range of
ionizing spectral shapes is insufficient to solely account for the variation in
W(Lya). Rather, the covering fraction of optically-thick HI appears to be the
principal factor modulating the escape of Lya, with most of the Lya photons in
down-the-barrel observations of galaxies escaping through low-column-density or
ionized channels in the ISM. Our analysis shows that a high star-formation-rate
surface density, Sigma_SFR, particularly when coupled with a low galaxy
potential (i.e., low stellar mass), can aid in reducing the covering fraction
and ease the escape of Lya photons. We conclude with a discussion of the

that the most massive clumps contain too little kinetic energy for virial

questions about how such a state might arise, and how it might persist long
enough to represent the population of massive clumps. In an effort to
re-examine the origins of this conclusion, we use ammonia line data from the
Green Bank Ammonia Survey and Planck-calibrated dust emission data from
Herschel to estimate the masses and kinetic and gravitational energies for
dense clumps in the Gould Belt clouds. We show that several types of systematic
error can enhance the appearance of low kinetic-to-gravitational energy ratios:
insufficient removal of foreground and background material; ignoring the
kinetic energy associated with velocity differences across a resolved cloud;
and over-correcting for stratification when evaluating the gravitational
energy. Using an analysis designed to avoid these errors, we find that the most
massive Gould Belt clumps harbor virial motions, rather than sub-virial ones.
As a byproduct, we present a catalog of masses, energies, and virial energy

increasing number of axion laboratory searches are underway worldwide, but
these efforts are made difficult by the fact that the axion mass is largely
unconstrained. If the axion is generated after inflation there is a unique mass
that gives rise to the observed DM abundance; due to nonlinearities and
topological defects known as strings, computing this mass accurately has been a
challenge for four decades. Recent works, making use of large static lattice
simulations, have led to largely disparate predictions for the axion mass,
spanning the range from 25 microelectronvolts to over 500 microelectronvolts.
In this work we show that adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) simulations are better
suited for axion cosmology than the previously-used static lattice simulations
because only the string cores require high spatial resolution. Using dedicated
AMR simulations we obtain an over three order of magnitude leap in dynamic
range and provide evidence that axion strings radiate their energy with a
scale-invariant spectrum, to within $\sim$5% precision, leading to a mass
prediction in the range (40,180) microelectronvolts.

retains the ""memory"" of the flavor D7-branes of the parent type IIB dual in the
sense that a specific combination of the aforementioned quartic corrections to
the metric components precisely along the compact part of the non-compact
four-cycle ""wrapped"" by the flavor D7-branes, is what determines, e.g., the
Einstein-Hilbert action at O$(R^4)$. The same linear combination of O$(R^4)$
metric corrections, upon matching the phenomenological value of the coupling
constant of one of the SU(3) NLO ChPT Lagrangian, is required to have a
definite sign. Interestingly, in the decompactification limit of the spatial
circle, we ${\it derive}$ this, and obtain the values of the relevant O$(R^4)$
metric corrections. Further, equivalence with Wald entropy for the black hole
at ${\cal O}(R^4)$ imposes a linear constraint on the same linear combination
of metric corrections. Remarkably, when evaluating $T_c$ from an entanglement
entropy computation in the thermal gravity dual, due to a delicate cancelation
between the ${\cal O}(R^4)$ corrections from a subset of the abovementioned
metric components, one sees that there are no corrections to $T_c$ at quartic

$C_{2z}T$-protected corner states of Majorana Kramers pairs appear at the

materialize in Abrikosov vortices. The topology of the superconducting phase
originates from the anomaly [1] -- the absence of a lattice support -- of the
single-valley band structure of twisted bilayer graphene, which is protected by
$C_{2z}T$ and the particle-hole symmetry $\cal P$. We prove that any pairing
(spin-singlet or spin-triplet) term preserving valley-U(1), spin-SU(2),
time-reversal, $C_{2z}T$, and $\cal P$ must drive the system into a
higher-order topological superconductor phase. Here spin-SU(2) is the global
spin-SU(2) for the singlet pairing and a combination of two SU(2)'s in the two
valleys for the triplet pairing. Using a Dirac Hamiltonian, we demonstrate the
existence of corner modes and confirm this with numerical calculations. These
corner states are stable even if the approximate particle-hole symmetry $\cal
P$ is weakly broken, which is true in experimental setups. Finally, we suggest
an experiment to detect the topological superconductivity: by observing the
fractional Josephson effect in a TBG-TSC Josephson system.

offer new possibilities for realizing long-lived interlayer exciton-based

  on academic productivity and performance",,,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.DL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Gender differences in research productivity are well documented, and have
been mostly explained by access parental leave and child-related
responsibilities. Those explanations are based on the assumption that women
take on the majority of childcare responsibilities, and take the same level of
leave at the birth of a child. Changing social dynamics around parenting has
seen fathers increasingly take an active role in parenting. This demands a more
nuanced approach to understanding how parenting affects both men and women.
Using a global survey of 11,226 academic parents, this study investigates the
effect of parental engagement (Lead, Dual (shared), and Satellite parenting),
and partner type, on measures of research productivity and impact for men and
for women. It also analyzes the effect of different levels of parental leave on
academic productivity. Results show that the parenting penalty for men and
women is a function of the level of engagement in parenting activities. Men who
serve in lead roles suffer similar penalties, but women are more likely to
serve in lead parenting roles and to be more engaged across time and tasks.
Taking a period of parental leave is associated with higher levels of
productivity, however the productivity advantage is lost for the US-sample at 6
months, and at 12-months for the non-US sample. These results suggest that
parental engagement is a more powerful variable to explain gender differences
in academic productivity than the mere existence of children, and that policies
should that factor into account.

the electron Green's function. The Luttinger arcs connect surface projections
of Weyl nodes of opposite chirality and form closed loops with the Fermi arcs

projections of bulk Fermi surfaces. Remarkably, unlike Luttinger contours in
strongly interacting systems, the precise shape of the Luttinger arcs can be
determined experimentally by removing a surface layer. We use this principle to
sketch the Luttinger arcs for Co and Sn terminations in

approximately equals the surface particle density in weakly coupled systems

accretion) using two statistics of quasars that are recently turned off (i.e.,
dimmed by a large factor): 1) the fraction of turned-off quasars in a
statistical sample photometrically observed over an extended period (e.g.,
$\Delta t=20$ yrs); 2) the fraction of massive galaxies that show 'orphan'
broad MgII emission, argued to be short-lived echoes of recently turned-off
quasars. The two statistics constrain the average episodic quasar lifetime to
be hundreds to thousands of years. Much longer (or shorter) episodic lifetimes
are strongly disfavored by these observations. This average episodic lifetime
is broadly consistent with the infall timescale (viscous time) in the standard
accretion disk model for quasars, suggesting that quasar episodes are governed
by accretion disk physics rather than by the gas supply on much larger scales.
Compared with the cumulative quasar lifetime of $\sim 10^6-10^8\,$yrs
constrained from quasar clustering and massive black hole demographics, our
results suggest that there are $\sim 10^3-10^5$ episodes of quasar accretion
during the assembly history of the supermassive black hole. Such short episodes
should be clustered over intervals of $\sim 10^4\,$yrs to account for the sizes
of ionized narrow-line regions in quasars. Our statistical argument also
dictates that there will always be a small fraction of extreme variability
quasars caught in 'state transitions' over multi-year observing windows,
despite the much longer episodic lifetime. These transitions could occur in a
rather abrupt fashion during non-steady accretion.

characteristic is that the dynamical system is not only driven by some physics
laws but also impacted by the localized factor in spatial and temporal regions.
One of the major challenges is to infer the underlying causes, which generate
the perceived data stream and propagate the involved causal dynamics through
the distributed observing units. Another challenge is that the success of
machine learning based predictive models requires massive annotated data for
model training. However, the acquisition of high-quality annotated data is
objectively manual and tedious as it needs a considerable amount of human
intervention, making it infeasible in fields that require high levels of

an active learning mechanism with Kriging for actively acquiring the most

more dimmed quasars than brightened ones, due to a selection bias induced at
the time of sample selection. Quasars are continuously varying and there are
more fainter quasars than brighter ones. At the time of selection, even
symmetrical variability will result in more quasars with their instantaneous
fluxes scattered above the flux limit than those scattered below, leading to an
asymmetry in flux changes over time. The same bias would lead to an asymmetry
in the ensemble structure function (SF) of the sample such that the SF based on
pairs with increasing fluxes will be slightly smaller than that based on pairs
with decreasing fluxes. We use simulated time-symmetric quasar light curves
based on the damped random walk prescription to illustrate the effects of this
bias. The level of this bias depends on the sample, the threshold of magnitude
changes, and the coverage of light curves, but the general behaviors are
consistent. In particular, the simulations matched to recent observational
studies with decade-long light curves produce an asymmetry in the SF
measurements at the few percent level, similar to the observed values. These
results provide a cautionary note on the reported time asymmetry in some recent
quasar variability studies.

interesting features in their spectra. The polarized light, and therefore its
properties, i.e. the fractional polarization and the polarized angle, are now

revealed by the data can be studied using the Stokes QU-fitting, which consists
of modeling the Stokes parameters Q and U using wavelength-dependent analytical

environment through chemostats to exchange both energy and materials. At a
mesoscopic scale, the number of each species in those biochemical reactions can
be modeled by a random time-changed Poisson processes. To characterize
macroscopic behaviors in the large volume limit, the law of large numbers in
the path space determines a mean-field limit nonlinear reaction rate equation
describing the dynamics of the concentration of species, while the WKB
expansion for the chemical master equation yields a Hamilton-Jacobi equation
(HJE) and the Lagrangian gives the good rate function in the large deviation
principle. We decompose a general macroscopic reaction rate equation into a
conservative part and a dissipative part in terms of the stationary solution to
HJE. This stationary solution is used to determine the energy landscape and
thermodynamics for general chemical reactions, which particularly maintains a
positive entropy production rate at a non-equilibrium steady state. The
associated energy dissipation law is proved together with the passage from the
mesoscopic to macroscopic one. Furthermore, we use a reversible Hamiltonian to
study a class of non-equilibrium enzyme reactions, which identifies a new
concept of balance within the same reaction vector due to flux grouping
degeneracy. This macroscopic reversibility, brought by the reversibility of the
chemical reaction jumping process, gives an Onsager-type strong gradient flow.
The reversible Hamiltonian also yields a time reversal symmetry for the
corresponding Lagrangian. Thus a modified time reversed least action path
serves as the transition paths with associated path affinities and energy
barriers.

field inflation as well as the question what fraction of phase space leads to
sufficient inflation, and furthermore is compatible with the experimental data.
In the present paper these issues are discussed in the context of modular
inflation, a specialization of the framework of automorphic nonlinear
$\sigma$-models associated to homogeneous spaces $G/K$ in which the continuous
shift symmetry group $G$ is weakly broken to discrete subgroups $\Gamma$. The
target spaces of these theories inherit a curved structure from the group $G$,
which in the case of modular invariant inflation leads to a hyperbolic field
space geometry. It is shown that in this class of models the symmetry structure
leads to both large and small field inflationary trajectories within a single
modular inflation model. The present paper analyzes the concrete model of
$j$-inflation, a hyperbolic model with nontrivial inflaton interactions. It
describes in some detail the structure of the initial conditions, including a
systematic analysis of several phenomenological functions on the target space,
leading to constraints on the curvature scalar of the field space by upcoming
experiments, as well as a discussion of the scaling behavior of the spectral
index, the finite volume fraction of the field space leading to sufficient
inflation, the attractor behavior of $j$-inflation, and a comparison of
inflaton trajectories vs. target space geodesics. The tensor-ratio analysis
shows that $j$-inflation is an interesting target for upcoming ground and
satellite experiments.

modified Yang-Baxter equations, splitting of algebras, weighted infinitesimal

$\lambda \in {\bf k}$, we construct a differential graded Lie algebra whose
Maurer-Cartan elements are given by $\lambda$-weighted relative Rota-Baxter
operators. Using such characterization, we define the cohomology of a
$\lambda$-weighted relative Rota-Baxter operator $T$, and interpret this as the
Hochschild cohomology of a suitable algebra with coefficients in an appropriate
bimodule. We study linear, formal and finite order deformations of $T$ from
cohomological points of view. Among others, we introduce Nijenhuis elements
that generate trivial linear deformations and define a second cohomology class
to any finite order deformation which is the obstruction to extend the
deformation. In the end, we also consider the cohomology of $\lambda$-weighted
relative Rota-Baxter operators in the Lie case and find a connection with the

extraordinary challenge. The multi-dimensional combustion instability problem
involves multi-scale lengths and characteristic times in an unsteady flow
problem with nonlinear acoustics, addressing both transient and
dynamic-equilibrium behaviors, superimposed on a turbulent reacting flow with
very narrow, moving flame regions. Accurate interpolation between the points of
the training data becomes vital. A major novel aspect of the proposed NNs is
that they are trained to reproduce relevant portions of the information stored
in a flamelet table by using only limited data from a few CFD simulations of a
single-injector liquid-propellant rocket engine under different dynamical
configurations. This is made possible by enriching the training set with
contrived data resulting from the physical characteristics of the combustion
model and also by including the flame temperature as an extra input to the NNs
that are trained to model other flame variables of interest. These
physics-aware NN-based closure models are first tested offline by comparing
them directly with the flamelet table and then are successfully implemented
into CFD simulations in place of the flamelet table and verified on various
dynamical configurations. The results from those tests compare favorably with

between its transparent host (i.e., the incidence medium) and an amplifying (or
gainy) second medium, the incident beam splits into a reflected wave and a
transmitted wave. In general, there is a sign ambiguity in connection with the
k-vector of the transmitted beam, which requires at the outset that one decide
whether the transmitted beam should grow or decay as it recedes from the
interface. The question has been posed and addressed most prominently in the
context of incidence at large angles from a dielectric medium of high
refractive index onto a gain medium of lower refractive index. Here, the
relevant sign of the transmitted k-vector determines whether the
evanescent-like waves within the gain medium exponentially grow or decay away
from the interface. We examine this and related problems in a more general
setting, where the incident beam is taken to be a finite-duration wavepacket
whose footprint in the interfacial plane has a finite width. Cases of
reflection from and transmission through a gainy slab of finite-thickness as
well as those associated with a semi-infinite gain medium will be considered.
The broadness of the spatio-temporal spectrum of our incident wavepacket
demands that we develop a general strategy for deciding the signs of all the
k-vectors that enter the gain medium. Such a strategy emerges from a
consideration of the causality constraint that is naturally imposed on both the
reflected and transmitted wavepackets.

Fr\'echet regression has provided an approach for modeling the conditional mean

here that for the case of multivariate Euclidean predictors, the parameters

substitute for the inherent absence of parameters in Fr\'echet regression.
Specifically, we derive the asymptotic consistency of suitable estimates of

$\propto\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon^2)$, where $\epsilon>0$ is the

tackle this issue, we provide an efficient algorithm that utilizes a gap
parameter, $\rho>0$, to reduce the amount of exploration. In particular, for an
unknown finite-horizon Markov decision process, the algorithm takes only
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}} (1/\epsilon \cdot (H^3SA / \rho + H^4 S^2 A) )$
episodes of exploration, and is able to obtain an $\epsilon$-optimal policy for
a post-revealed reward with sub-optimality gap at least $\rho$, where $S$ is

the horizon, obtaining a nearly \emph{quadratic saving} in terms of $\epsilon$.
We show that, information-theoretically, this bound is nearly tight for $\rho <

$\propto\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(1)$ sample bound is possible for $H=1$ (i.e.,
multi-armed bandit) or with a sampling simulator, establishing a stark

more recently, the heavy-fermion CeCu$_{2}$Si$_{2}$ have shown signatures of
fully-gapped but sign-changing superconductivity (SC). A two-orbital pairing
state, called $s\tau_{3}$, with non-trivial matrix structure, was proposed as a
candidate able to reconcile the seemingly contradictory properties of these
SC's. Motivated by the non-trivial orbital structure of the proposed
$s\tau_{3}$ state, which has orbital-selective pairing structure, we study
prototypical Josephson junctions where at least one of the leads is in a SC
state of this kind. An analysis of these junctions in the limit of two
degenerate orbitals (bands) and with a simple form of junction hybridization
reveals several remarkable properties. One is the emergence of gapless, purely
electron- and hole-like bound states for $s\tau_{3}-N-s\tau_{3}$ junctions with
arbitrary global phase difference between the leads, and likewise for
$s\tau_{3}-N-I$ junctions. The other is the absence of static Josephson
currents when both leads are SC's. In both of these signatures, $s\tau_{3}$
junctions are dramatically different from conventional Josephson junctions. We
also find that the gapless bound states are protected by an orbital-exchange
symmetry, although the protection is not topological. Junctions which break
this symmetry, such as $s\tau_{3}-N-s$, have gapped Andreev bound states. In
general, the Josephson effect also re-emerges once the degeneracy of the two
orbitals is lifted. We support these conclusions via analytical and numerical
results for the bound states, together with microscopic calculations of the
Josephson current. Our results indicate that junctions involving $s\tau_{3}$
pairing in alkaline Fe-selenides's will generically have bound states with a
small gap together with a greatly suppressed Josephson current.

presence of remarkably high amplitude (>0.5 mag) modulations, which evolve from
the superhump (16.87 h) period towards the presumed orbital (16.45 h) period.
These modulations appear ~87d after the outburst began, and follow the
Swift/BAT hard X-ray light-curve, which peaks 4 days before the radio flare and
jet ejection, when the source undergoes a rapid hard to soft state transition.
The optical modulation then moves closer to the orbital period, with a light
curve peak that drifts slowly in orbital phase from ~0.8 to ~0.3 during the
soft state. We propose that the unprecedentedly large amplitude modulation
requires a warp in the disc in order to provide a large enough radiating area,
and for the warp to be irradiation-driven. Its sudden turn-on implies a change
in the inner disc geometry that raises the hard X-ray emitting component to a

would generalize poorly and even mislead the decision process in real-life
applications. We propose to remove the bias information misused by the target
task with a cross-sample adversarial debiasing (CSAD) method. CSAD explicitly
extracts target and bias features disentangled from the latent representation
generated by a feature extractor and then learns to discover and remove the
correlation between the target and bias features. The correlation measurement
plays a critical role in adversarial debiasing and is conducted by a
cross-sample neural mutual information estimator. Moreover, we propose joint
content and local structural representation learning to boost mutual
information estimation for better performance. We conduct thorough experiments
on publicly available datasets to validate the advantages of the proposed
method over state-of-the-art approaches.

PID controller. The proportional, integral and derivative gains (KP, KI, KD) of
the PID controller are adjusted according to Fuzzy logic. First of all, the
fuzzy logic controller is designed according to rules so that the systems is
basically robust. There are 25 rules for the auto-tuning of each parameter of
the PID controller. The FLC (fuzzy logic controller) has two inputs. The first
is the motor speed error between the reference (setpoint) and the actual speed.
The second is the variation of the speed error (derivative of the speed error).
Secondly the output of the FLC is the parameters of the PID controller which
are used to control the speed of the DC motor. The study shows that both the
precise characters of PID controllers and the flexible characters of fuzzy
controllers are present in the fuzzy self-tuning PID controller. The fuzzy
auto-tuning approach implemented on a conventional PID structure was able to
control the speed of the DC motor. It also improved the dynamic and static
response of the system. The comparison between the conventional response and
the fuzzy self-tuning response was performed based on the simulation result
obtained by MATLAB/SIMULINK.
  The simulation results show that the designed self-adaptive PID controller
achieves good dynamic behavior of the DC motor, perfect speed tracking with
short rise and settling times, zero overshoot and steady state error and thus
gives better performance compared to the conventional PID controller. We then
model the fuzzy PID using simple code on Arduino IDE and perform a practical
experiment, to confirm our theorical results.

radius and mass coefficients, $\kappa_R$ and $\kappa_M$, for $\sim 19,000$ red
giant stars, which translate directly to radius and mass given a temperature.
As such, K2 GAP DR3 represents the largest asteroseismic sample in the
literature to date. K2 GAP DR3 stellar parameters are calibrated to be on an
absolute parallactic scale based on Gaia DR2, with red giant branch and red
clump evolutionary state classifications provided via a machine-learning
approach. Combining these stellar parameters with GALAH DR3 spectroscopy, we
determine asteroseismic ages with precisions of $\sim 20-30\%$ and compare
age-abundance relations to Galactic chemical evolution models among both low-
and high-$\alpha$ populations for $\alpha$, light, iron-peak, and
neutron-capture elements. We confirm recent indications in the literature of
both increased Ba production at late Galactic times, as well as significant
contribution to r-process enrichment from prompt sources associated with, e.g.,
core-collapse supernovae. With an eye toward other Galactic archaeology
applications, we characterize K2 GAP DR3 uncertainties and completeness using

researches on various tilting multirotors that can increase maneuverability has
been employed. Unfortunately, existing studies on the tilting multirotors
require considerable amounts of prior information on the complex dynamic model.
Meanwhile, reinforcement learning on quadrotors has been studied to mitigate
this issue. Yet, these are only been applied to standard quadrotors, whose
systems are less complex than those of tilting multirotors. In this paper, a
novel reinforcement learning-based method is proposed to control a tilting
multirotor on real-world applications, which is the first attempt to apply
reinforcement learning to a tilting multirotor. To do so, we propose a novel
reward function for a neural network model that takes power efficiency into
account. The model is initially trained over a simulated environment and then
fine-tuned using real-world data in order to overcome the sim-to-real gap
issue. Furthermore, a novel, efficient state representation with respect to the
goal frame that helps the network learn optimal policy better is proposed. As
verified on real-world experiments, our proposed method shows robust
controllability by overcoming the complex dynamics of tilting multirotors.

for predicting extreme events occurring in the flow around an airfoil at low
Reynolds. For certain Reynolds numbers the aerodynamic forces exhibit
intermittent fluctuations caused by changes in the behavior of vortices in the
airfoil wake. Such events are prototypical of the unsteady behavior observed in
airfoils at low Reynolds and their prediction is extremely challenging due to
their intermittency and the chaotic nature of the flow. We seek to forecast
these fluctuations in advance of their occurrence by a specified length of
time. We assume knowledge only of the pressure at a discrete set of points on
the surface of the airfoil, as well as offline knowledge of the state of the
flow. Methods include direct prediction from historical pressure measurements,
flow reconstruction followed by forward integration using a full order solver,
and data-driven dynamic models in various low dimensional quantities. Methods
are compared using several criteria tailored for extreme event prediction. We
show that methods using data-driven models of low order dynamic variables
outperform those without dynamic models and that unlike previous works, low
dimensional initializations do not accurately predict observables with extreme
events such as drag.

many-objective test case generation, the standard crossover operator
(single-point) only alters the structure of the test cases but not the input

Confluent drawings of networks do not have these ambiguities, but require the

method, Edge-Path bundling, to simplify edge clutter while greatly reducing
ambiguities compared to previous bundling techniques. Edge-Path bundling takes
a layout as input and clusters each edge along a weighted, shortest path to
limit its deviation from a straight line. Edge-Path bundling does not incur
independent edge ambiguities typically seen in all edge bundling methods, and
the level of bundling can be tuned through shortest path distances, Euclidean
distances, and combinations of the two. Also, directed edge bundling naturally
emerges from the model. Through metric evaluations, we demonstrate the
advantages of Edge-Path bundling over other techniques.

phase to a Berry phase arising from many-body wave functions is applied to the
circuit quantization for superconducting qubits.
  The phase-charge duality required for the occurrence of superconductivity in
the standard theory becomes irrelevant in the new theory, and the absence of a
dissipative quantum phase transition in Josephson junctions is explained. It is
shown that a charge-decaying term leads to the compact phase description, and
the appearance of Shapiro steps is explained without introducing normal

strategies. This result was extended in several directions; here we strengthen
it further. We construct two special NE realized by a lexicographically safe

polynomial algorithm computing these lexsafe NE. This is trivial when game form
$g$ is given explicitly. Yet, in applications $g$ is frequently realized by an
oracle $\cO$ such that size of $g$ is exponential in size $|\cO|$ of $\cO$. We
assume that game form $g = g(\cO)$ generated by $\cO$ is tight and that an
arbitrary {\em win-lose game} $(g;u,w)$ (in which payoffs $u$ and $w$ are
zero-sum and take only values $\pm 1$) can be solved, in time polynomial in

four types of oracles known in the literature and show that all four satisfy

Although such loss functions typically produce better scores if the evaluation

this phenomenon has been experimentally observed by many studies, it is often

an efficient hybridization of volumetric and surface-based advection-projection

detailed water splashes near moving objects with the FLIP method, and produces
convincing water waves with correct dispersion relationships at modest

MIMO-OFDM system: inter carrier interference (ICI) and channel aging. In
practice, it is common to allot multiple contiguous subcarriers to a user as
well as schedule multiple users on each subcarrier. Motivated by this, we
consider a general subcarrier allocation scheme and derive expressions for the
ICI power, uplink signal to interference plus noise ratio and the achievable
uplink sum-rate, taking into account the ICI and the multi-user interference
due to channel aging. We show that the system incurs a near-constant ICI power
that depends linearly on the ratio of the number of users per subcarrier to the
number of subcarriers per user, nearly independently of how the UEs distribute
their power across the subcarriers. Further, we exploit the coherence bandwidth
of the channel to reduce the length of the pilot sequences required for uplink
channel estimation. We consider both zero-forcing and maximal-ratio combining
at the receiver and compare the respective sum-rate performances. In either
case, the proposed subcarrier allocation scheme leads to significantly higher
sum-rates compared to previous work, owing to the near-constant ICI property as
well as the reduced pilot overhead.

of a galaxy depends on its mass assembly history, which is imprinted in its
morphology and gradients of age, metallicity, and stellar initial mass function
(IMF). Taking a MaNGA sample of 2051 galaxies with stellar masses ranging from
$10^9$ to $10^{12}M_\odot$ released in SDSS DR15, we focus on face-on galaxies,
without merger and bar signatures, and investigate the dependence of the 2D
$\nabla (M_*/L_r)$ on other galaxy properties, including $M_*/L_r$-colour
relationships by assuming a fixed Salpeter IMF as the mass normalization
reference. The median gradient is $\nabla M_*/L_r\sim -0.1$ (i.e., the
$M_*/L_r$ is larger at the centre) for massive galaxies, becomes flat around
$M_*\sim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$ and change sign to $\nabla M_*/L_r\sim 0.1$ at the
lowest masses. The $M_*/L_r$ inside a half light radius increases with
increasing galaxy stellar mass; in each mass bin, early-type galaxies have the
highest value, while pure-disk late-type galaxies have the smallest.
Correlation analyses suggest that the mass-weighted stellar age is the dominant
parameter influencing the $M_*/L_r$ profile, since a luminosity-weighted age is
easily affected by star formation when the specific star formation rate (sSFR)
inside the half light radius is higher than $10^{-3} {\rm Gyr}^{-1}$. With
increased sSFR gradient, one can obtain a steeper negative $\nabla (M_*/L_r)$.
The scatter in the slopes of $M_*/L$-colour relations increases with increasing
sSFR, for example, the slope for post-starburst galaxies can be flattened to
$0.45$ from the global value $0.87$ in the $M_*/L$ vs. $g-r$ diagram. Hence
converting galaxy colours to $M_*/L$ should be done carefully, especially for
those galaxies with young luminosity-weighted stellar ages, which can have
quite different star formation histories.

non-stationary optical parametric amplification in the presence of significant
temporal walk-off between pump and signal leading to half-harmonic generation
accompanied by a substantial pulse compression (exceeding a factor of 40) at
low pump pulse energies ($\sim$ 4 picojoules). The bright quadratic soliton
forms in a low-finesse cavity in both normal and anomalous dispersion regimes,

orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The vulnerability of
traditional key generation technology based on channel frequency response (CFR)

a flexible quantization method is employed to maximize the Key Generation Rate

the attack path variance to the total path variance is 0.17, the Bit
Disagreement Rate (BDR) of the CFR-based method is greater than 0.25, and the
KGR is close to zero. In addition, the proposed detection method can
successfully detect the attacked path for SNR above 0 dB in the case of 16

exploits a heterogeneity-wise fusion module to dynamically fuse the node

scale-wise fusion module to adaptively aggregate the multi-scale features

can jointly perform feature learning and cluster assignment in an unsupervised

local fields that are resonantly enhanced. In this paper, we derive a rigorous
formula for field enhancement, and analyze its dependence on the frequency,
wavevector and amplitude of the incident wave. For resonances with multiple
radiation channels, we determine the incident wave that maximizes the field
enhancement, and find conditions under which the field enhancement can be
related to the radiation and dissipation quality factors. We also show that
with respect to the Bloch wavevector, the largest field enhancement is obtained
approximately when the radiation and dissipation quality factors are equal. Our

Furthermore, the spectrum acquires also accidental nodal lines with enhanced

collision mechanism in the envelope approximation and the so-called bulk flow

calculate the gravitational wave spectrum for a specific model of deformations
on a definite size scale, which gives a peak away from that of the bubble

non-observation of extremely high energy neutrinos -- and their implications
for the observed high energy astrophysical neutrino spectrum. We find
acceleration mechanisms producing power-law CR spectra~$\propto E^{-2}$ are
compatible with UHECR data, if CRs at high rigidities are in the
quasi-ballistic diffusion regime as they escape their source environment. Both
gas-dominated and photon-dominated source environments are able to account for
UHECR observations, however photon-dominated sources give a better fit.
Additionally, gas-dominated sources are in tension with current neutrino
constraints. Accurate measurement of the neutrino flux at $\sim 10$ PeV will
provide crucial information on the viability of gas-dominated sources, as well
as whether diffusive shock acceleration is consistent with UHECR observations.
We also show that UHECR sources are able to give a good fit to the high energy
portion of the astrophysical neutrino spectrum, above $\sim$ PeV. This common
origin of UHECRs and high energy astrophysical neutrinos is natural if air
shower data is interpreted with the Sibyll2.3c hadronic interaction model,

with at worst canonical singularities satisfying $K_X^2 = 4p_g(X)-8$, for any
even integer $p_g\geq 4$. These surfaces also have unbounded irregularity $q$.
We carry out our study by investigating the deformations of the canonical
morphism $\varphi:X\to \mathbb{P}^N$, where $\varphi$ is Galois of degree 4.
These canonical covers are classified in by the first two authors into four
distinct families. We show that any deformation of $\varphi$ factors through a
double cover of a ruled surface and, hence, is never birational. More
interestingly, we prove that, with two exceptions, a general deformation of
$\varphi$ is two-to-one onto its image, whose normalization is a ruled surface
of appropriate irregularity. We also show that with the exception of one
family, the deformations of $X$ are unobstructed, and consequently, $X$ belongs
to a unique irreducible component of the Gieseker moduli space, which we prove
is uniruled. As a result of all this, we show the existence of infinitely many
moduli spaces, satisfying the strict Beauville inequality $p_g > 2q-4$, with an
irreducible component that has a proper ""quadruple"" sublocus where the degree
of the canonical morphism jumps up. The existence of jumping subloci is a
contrast with the moduli of surfaces with $K_X^2 = 2p_g - 4$, studied by
Horikawa. There is a similarity and difference to the moduli of curves of genus
$g\geq 3$, for, like in the case of curves, the degree of the canonical
morphism goes down outside a closed sublocus but, unlike in the case of curves,
it is never birational.

However, for metric learning, due to data limitations, the speech anchor is
highly susceptible to the acoustic environment and speakers. Also, we note that
the 1D-CNN models have limited capability to capture long-term temporal
acoustic features. To address the above problems, we propose to utilize text
anchors to improve the stability of anchors. Furthermore, a new type of model
(LG-Net) is exquisitely designed to promote long-short term acoustic feature
modeling based on 1D-CNN and self-attention. Experiments are conducted on
Google Speech Commands Dataset version 1 (GSCDv1) and 2 (GSCDv2). The results
demonstrate that the proposed text anchor based metric learning method shows
consistent improvements over speech anchor on representative CNN-based models.
Moreover, our LG-Net model achieves SOTA accuracy of 97.67% and 96.79% on two

the robot possesses unique multi-mode locomotion capability. In detail, the
in-pipe earthworm-like peristaltic crawling is achieved based on
servomotor-driven cords and pre-bent spring-steel belts that work
antagonistically, and the three-dimensional underwater swimming is realized by
four independently-controlled propellers. With a robot covering made of silicon
rubber, the two locomotion modes are tested in the underwater environment,
through which, the rationality and the effectiveness of the robot design are
demonstrated. Aiming at predicting the robotic locomotion performance,
mechanical models of the robot are further developed. For the underwater
swimming mode, by considering the robot as a spheroid, an equivalent dynamic
model is constructed, whose validity is verified via computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) simulations; for the in-pipe crawling mode, a classical
kinematics model is employed to predict the average locomotion speeds under
different gait controls. The outcomes of this research could offer useful
design and modeling guidelines for the development of earthworm-like locomotion
robots with unique underwater multi-mode locomotion capability.

envelopes are derived using frequency domain linear prediction (FDLP) which
performs an autoregressive estimation of the Hilbert envelopes. The neural
dereverberation model estimates the envelope gain which when applied to
reverberant signals suppresses the late reflection components in the far-field

recognition. Further, the sequence of steps involved in envelope

evaluate peer prediction mechanisms according to both of these important

mechanisms to peer assessment -- a setting in which ex post fairness concerns
are particularly salient. We find that peer prediction mechanisms, as proposed

concerning robustness against strategic reporting are somewhat noisy predictors

Ultimately, however, we show that supplementing mechanisms with realistic

capacity and energy efficiency by forming platoons with short headways on the
road. However at low CAV penetration, the capacity gain will be small because
the CAVs that randomly enter the road will be sparsely distributed, diminishing
the probability of forming long platoons. Many researchers propose to solve
this issue by platoon organization strategies, where the CAVs search for other
CAVs on the road and change lanes if necessary to form longer platoons.
However, the current literature does not analyze a potential risk of platoon
organization in disrupting the flow and reducing the capacity by inducing more
lane changes. In this research, we use driving model of Cooperative Adaptive
Cruise Control (CACC) vehicles and human-driven vehicles that are validated
with field experiments and find that platoon organization can indeed drop the
capacity with more lane changes. But when the traffic demand is well below
capacity, platoon organization forms longer CAV platoons without reducing the
flow. Based on this finding, we develop the Flow-Aware platoon organization
strategy, where the CAVs perform platoon organization conditionally on the
local traffic state, i.e., a low flow and a high speed. We simulate the
Flow-Aware platoon organization on a realistic freeway network and show that
the CAVs successfully form longer platoons, while ensuring a maximal traffic
flow.

scrutiny, due to the occurrence of exotic quantum phenomena linked to
electronic correlation and interfacial composition. For instance, if two
anti-ferromagnetic insulators as LaMnO$_3$ and SrMnO$_3$ are grown in a
(001)-oriented superlattice, a half-metallic ferromagnet may form, provided
that the thickness is sufficiently small to allow tunneling across interfaces.
In this article, we employ electronic structure calculations to show that all
the layers of a (111)-oriented LaMnO$_3$|SrMnO$_3$ superlattice retain a
half-metallic ferromagnetic character for a much larger thickness than in its
(001) counterpart. This behavior is shown to be linked to the charge transfer
across the interface, favored by the octahedral connectivity between the
layers. This also results in a symmetry-induced quenching of the Jahn-Teller
distortions, which are replaced by breathing modes. The latter are coupled to
charge and spin oscillations, whose components have a pure e g character. Most
interestingly, the magnetization reaches its maximum value inside the LaMnO$_3$
region and not at the interface, which is fundamentally different from what
observed for the (001) orientation. The analysis of the inter-atomic exchange
coupling shows that the magnetic order arises from the double-exchange
mechanism, despite competing interactions inside the SrMnO$_3$ region. Finally,
the van Vleck distortions and the spin oscillations are found to be crucially
affected by the variation of Hund's exchange and charge doping, which allows us
to speculate that our system behaves as a Hund's metal, creating an interesting
connection between manganites and nickelates.

information about their environment via the dynamics of interacting units.
These can transition between distinct macroscopic behaviors. Near such a
transition (or critical point) collective computation is generally thought to
be optimized, due to the associated maximal sensitivity to perturbations and
fast dissemination of information. For biological systems, however, optimality
depends on environmental context, making the flexible, context-dependent
adoption of different distances to a critical point potentially more beneficial
than its unique properties. Here, studying escape waves in schooling fish at
two levels of perceived environmental risk, we investigate a) if and how
distance to criticality is regulated in response to environmental changes and
b) how the individual level benefits derived from special properties of the
critical point compare to those achieved via regulation of the group's distance
to it. We find that the observed fish schools are subcritical (not maximally
responsive and sensitive to environmental cues), but decrease their distance to
criticality with increased perceived risk. Considering an individual's
hypothetical costs of two detection error types, we find that optimal distance
to criticality depends on the riskiness and noisiness of the environment, which
may explain the observed behavior. Our results highlight the benefit of
evaluating biological consequences of different distances to criticality for
individuals within animal collectives. This provides insights into the adaptive
function of a collective system and motivates future questions about the
evolutionary forces that brought the system to make this particular trade-off.

on the human driver. In previous studies, the decision-making of lane-changing
of the human drivers was mainly used to increase the individual's benefit.
However, the lane-changing behavior of these human drivers can sometimes have a
bad influence on the overall traffic flow. As technology for autonomous
vehicles develop, lane changing action as well as lane changing decision making
fall within the control category of autonomous vehicles. However, since many of
the current lane-changing decision algorithms of autonomous vehicles are based
on the human driver model, it is hard to know the potential traffic impact of
such lane change. Therefore, in this study, we focused on the decision-making
of lane change considering traffic flow, and accordingly, we study the lane
change control system considering the whole traffic flow. In this research, the
lane change control system predicts the future traffic situation through the
cell transition model, one of the most popular macroscopic traffic simulation
models, and determines the change probability of each lane that minimizes the
total time delay through the genetic algorithm. The lane change control system
then conveys the change probability to this vehicle. In the macroscopic
simulation result, the proposed control system reduced the overall travel time
delay. The proposed system is applied to microscopic traffic simulation, the
oversaturated freeway traffic flow algorithm (OFFA), to evaluate the potential
performance when it is applied to the actual traffic system. In the traffic
flow-density, the maximum traffic flow has been shown to be increased, and the
points in the congestion area have also been greatly reduced. Overall, the time

efforts on considering the user-item interactions as a user-item bipartite

study, we investigated the interaction of hydrodynamic shocks with Bonnor-Ebert
spheres using 3D hydrodynamical simulations with self-gravity. Our simulations
indicated that the cloud evolution primarily depends on two parameters: the
shock speed and initial cloud radius. The stronger shock can compress the cloud
more efficiently, and when the central region becomes gravitationally unstable,
a shock triggers the cloud contraction. However, if it is excessively strong,
it shreds the cloud more violently and the cloud is destroyed. From simple
theoretical considerations, we derived the condition of triggered gravitational
collapse, which agreed with the simulation results. Introducing sink particles,
we followed the further evolution after star formation. Since stronger shocks
tend to shred the cloud material more efficiently, the stronger the shock is,
the smaller the final (asymptotic) masses of the stars formed (i.e., sink
particles) become. In addition, the shock accelerates the cloud, promoting
mixing of shock-accelerated interstellar medium gas. As a result, the
separation between the sink particles and the shocked cloud center and their
relative speed increase over time. We also investigated the effect of cloud
turbulence on shock-cloud interaction. We observed that the cloud turbulence
prevents rapid cloud contraction; thus, the turbulent cloud is destroyed more
rapidly than the thermally-supported cloud. Therefore, the masses of stars
formed become smaller. Our simulations can provide a general guide to the
evolutionary process of dense cores and Bok globules impacted by shocks.

transfer processes. A common way to characterize the wettability alteration is
by measuring the contact angles of an oil droplet with and without

capture the wettability changes to the surface. Here, we employed several
complementary techniques, such as cryo-scanning electron microscopy, confocal
fluorescence and reflection interference contrast microscopy and droplet probe
atomic force Microscopy (AFM), to visualize and quantify the wettability
alterations by fumed silica nanoparticles. We found that nanoparticles adsorbed
onto glass surfaces to form a porous layer with hierarchical micro- and
nano-structures. The porous layer is able to trap a thin water film, which
reduces contact between the oil droplet and the solid substrate. As a result,
even a small addition of nanoparticles (0.1 wt%) lowers the adhesion force for

Plane Fitting, which is performed to estimate the partial ground for each bin.

actively studied to mitigate the domain gap between label-rich source data and
unlabeled target data. Despite these efforts, UDA still has a long way to go to
reach the fully supervised performance. To this end, we propose a Labeling Only
if Required strategy, LabOR, where we introduce a human-in-the-loop approach to
adaptively give scarce labels to points that a UDA model is uncertain about. In
order to find the uncertain points, we generate an inconsistency mask using the
proposed adaptive pixel selector and we label these segment-based regions to
achieve near supervised performance with only a small fraction (about 2.2%)
ground truth points, which we call ""Segment based Pixel-Labeling (SPL)"". To
further reduce the efforts of the human annotator, we also propose ""Point-based
Pixel-Labeling (PPL)"", which finds the most representative points for labeling
within the generated inconsistency mask. This reduces efforts from 2.2% segment
label to 40 points label while minimizing performance degradation. Through
extensive experimentation, we show the advantages of this new framework for
domain adaptive semantic segmentation while minimizing human labor costs.

  In this paper we study the algorithmic complexity of the unbounded subset

precisely, we study pseudo-polynomial time algorithms with a running time that
depends on the smallest number $a_0$ or respectively the largest number $a_n$.
For the parameter $a_0$, we show that all considered problems are
subquadratically equivalent to $(min,+)$-convolution, a fundamental algorithmic
problem from the area of fine-grained complexity. By this equivalence, we
obtain hardness results for the considered problems (based on the assumption
that an algorithm with a subquadratic running time for $(min,+)$-convolution
does not exist) as well as algorithms with improved running time. The proof for
the equivalence makes use of structural properties of solutions, a technique
that was developed in the area of integer programming.
  In case of the complexity of the problems parameterized by $a_n$, we present
improved algorithms. For example we give a quasi linear time algorithm for the

highly structured molecular clouds require adequate extraction methods that

omnipresence of filamentary structures and their physical connection to
prestellar cores demand methods that are able to disentangle and extract both

methods to compare their detection and measurement qualities and fully
understand their capabilities before their scientific applications. A recent
publication described getsf, the new method for source and filament extraction
that employs the separation of the structural components, a successor to
getsources, getfilaments, and getimages (collectively referred to as getold).
This new paper describes a detailed benchmarking of both getsf and getold using
two multicomponent, multiwavelength benchmarks resembling the Herschel
observations of the nearby star-forming regions. Each benchmark consists of
simulated images at six Herschel wavelengths and one additional surface density
image with a 13 arcsec resolution. The structural components of the benchmarks
include a background cloud, a dense filament, hundreds of starless and
protostellar cores, and instrumental noise. Five variants of benchmark images
of different complexity are used to perform the source and filament extractions
with getsf and getold. A formalism for evaluating source detection and
measurement qualities is presented, allowing quantitative comparisons of
extraction methods in terms of their completeness, reliability, and goodness,
as well as the detection and measurement accuracies and the overall quality. A
detailed analysis shows that getsf has better qualities than getold and that
the best choice for source detection is the high-resolution surface density.

this paper a novel resilience metric for linear time invariant systems is
proposed: the minimum control energy required to disturb the system is set into
relation to the minimum control energy needed to recover. This definition
extends known disturbance rejection metrics considering random effects to

Swift J1644+57 as an example to study the evolution of various properties
related to the short-term X-ray variability, such as the X-ray flux
distribution, power spectral density (PSD), rms variability, time lag and
coherence spectra. We find that the flux distribution of Swift J1644+57 has a
lognormal form in the normal state, but deviates from it significantly in the
dipping state, thereby implying different physical mechanisms in the two
states. We also find that during the first two XMM-Newton observations in the
dipping state, Swift J1644+57 exhibited different variability patterns, which
are characterized by steeper PSDs and larger rms than the normal state. A
significant soft X-ray lag is detected in these two observations, which is ~50
s between 0.3-1 keV and 2-10 keV with a high coherence. Using the 2-10 keV rms
of 0.10-0.50, the black hole mass of Swift J1644+57 is estimated to be
$(0.6-7.9)\times10^{6}M_{\odot}$, but the variation of rms as the TDE evolves
introduces a large uncertainty. Finally, we discuss the value of conducting
similar studies on other TDEs, especially in the coming era of time-domain
astronomy when a lot more TDEs will be discovered in X-rays promptly. This also
heralds a significant increase in the demand for deep follow-up observations of

further find that the relaxation times of the on-site concurrence become

morphologies to gain an insight on the processes that lead galaxy evolution,
e.g. gas condensation, star formation, AGN feedback. The 11 DSFGs are very
compact in the (sub-)millimeter (median r(ALMA) = 1.15 kpc), while the optical
emission extends tolarger radii (median r(H)/r(ALMA) = 2.05). CO lines reveal
the presence of a rotating disc of molecular gas, but we can not exclude either
the presence of interactions and/or molecular outflows. Images at higher
(spectral and spatial) resolution are needed to disentangle from the possible
scenarios. Most of the galaxies are caught in the compaction phase, when gas
cools and falls into galaxy centre, fuelling the dusty burst of star formation

These videos are usually shown in in-person meetings. However, face-to-face
meetings are not suited to every situation and every stakeholder, for example
due to scheduling constraints. Methods for the use of vision videos in online
settings are necessary. Furthermore, methods enabling an asynchronous use of
vision videos are needed for cases when conjoined meetings are impossible even
in an online setting.
  In this paper, we compare synchronous and asynchronous viewings of vision
videos in online settings. The two methods are piloted in a preliminary
experiment. The results show a difference in the amount of arguments regarding
the presented visions. On average, participants who took part in asynchronous
meetings stated more arguments. Our results point to multiple advantages and

appointment to discuss the vision and to quickly resolve ambiguities. An
asynchronous meeting could be held if a joint meeting is not feasible due to
time constraints. We also discuss how our findings can be applied to the

different contrasts is usually acquired in a single study to assess different

acquisition process can be accelerated by having one or more modalities
under-sampled in the $k$-space. Recent research has shown that, considering the
redundancy between different modalities, a target MRI modality under-sampled in
the $k$-space can be more efficiently reconstructed with a fully-sampled
reference MRI modality. However, we find that the performance of the
aforementioned multi-modal reconstruction can be negatively affected by subtle
spatial misalignment between different modalities, which is actually common in
clinical practice. In this paper, we improve the quality of multi-modal
reconstruction by compensating for such spatial misalignment with a spatial
alignment network. First, our spatial alignment network estimates the
displacement between the fully-sampled reference and the under-sampled target
images, and warps the reference image accordingly. Then, the aligned
fully-sampled reference image joins the multi-modal reconstruction of the
under-sampled target image. Also, considering the contrast difference between
the target and reference images, we have designed a
cross-modality-synthesis-based registration loss in combination with the
reconstruction loss, to jointly train the spatial alignment network and the

actions in untrimmed videos with only video-level labels. Currently, most
state-of-the-art WSTAL methods follow a Multi-Instance Learning (MIL) pipeline:
producing snippet-level predictions first and then aggregating to the
video-level prediction. However, we argue that existing methods have overlooked
two important drawbacks: 1) inadequate use of motion information and 2) the
incompatibility of prevailing cross-entropy training loss. In this paper, we
analyze that the motion cues behind the optical flow features are complementary
informative. Inspired by this, we propose to build a context-dependent motion
prior, termed as motionness. Specifically, a motion graph is introduced to
model motionness based on the local motion carrier (e.g., optical flow). In
addition, to highlight more informative video snippets, a motion-guided loss is
proposed to modulate the network training conditioned on motionness scores.
Extensive ablation studies confirm that motionness efficaciously models
action-of-interest, and the motion-guided loss leads to more accurate results.
Besides, our motion-guided loss is a plug-and-play loss function and is
applicable with existing WSTAL methods. Without loss of generality, based on
the standard MIL pipeline, our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance
on three challenging benchmarks, including THUMOS'14, ActivityNet v1.2 and

experiments and computational modeling, which improve imaging significantly

super-resolved reconstructions. Simulations and physical experiments
demonstrate the high-quality super-resolution phase imaging. In the

but practical scenario where out-of-distribution (OOD) samples are contained in
the unlabeled data. While the mainstream technique seeks to completely filter
out the OOD samples for semi-supervised learning (SSL), we propose a novel
training mechanism that could effectively exploit the presence of OOD data for
enhanced feature learning while avoiding its adverse impact on the SSL. We
achieve this goal by first introducing a warm-up training that leverages all
the unlabeled data, including both the in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples.
Specifically, we perform a pretext task that enforces our feature extractor to
obtain a high-level semantic understanding of the training images, leading to
more discriminative features that can benefit the downstream tasks. Since the
OOD samples are inevitably detrimental to SSL, we propose a novel cross-modal
matching strategy to detect OOD samples. Instead of directly applying binary
classification, we train the network to predict whether the data sample is
matched to an assigned one-hot class label. The appeal of the proposed
cross-modal matching over binary classification is the ability to generate a
compatible feature space that aligns with the core classification task.
Extensive experiments show that our approach substantially lifts the
performance on open-set SSL and outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large
margin.

practice, many real-world applications such as e-commerce search require
enforcing certain distributional criteria at the slate-level, due to business

in making these solutions business-grade. One major challenge is to ensure that
the ML solution provides its expected business value. In order to do that, one
has to bridge the gap between the way ML model performance is measured and the
solution requirements. In previous work (Barash et al, ""Bridging the gap..."")
we demonstrated the effectiveness of utilizing feature models in bridging this
gap. Whereas ML performance metrics, such as the accuracy or F1-score of a
classifier, typically measure the average ML performance, feature models shed
light on explainable data slices that are too far from that average, and
therefore might indicate unsatisfied requirements. For example, the overall
accuracy of a bank text terms classifier may be very high, say $98\% \pm 2\%$,
yet it might perform poorly for terms that include short descriptions and
originate from commercial accounts. A business requirement, which may be
implicit in the training data, may be to perform well regardless of the type of
account and length of the description. Therefore, the under-performing data
slice that includes short descriptions and commercial accounts suggests
poorly-met requirements. In this paper we show the feasibility of automatically
extracting feature models that result in explainable data slices over which the
ML solution under-performs. Our novel technique, IBM FreaAI aka FreaAI,
extracts such slices from structured ML test data or any other labeled data. We
demonstrate that FreaAI can automatically produce explainable and

a regularization term imposing the orthogonality of convolutional layers has
been proposed, and impressive empirical results have been obtained in different

to specify the theory behind this.We make the link between this regularization
term and orthogonality measures. In doing so, we show that this regularization
strategy is stable with respect to numerical and optimization errors and that,
in the presence of small errors and when the size of the signal/image is large,
the convolutional layers remain close to isometric.The theoretical results are
confirmed with experiments and the landscape of the regularization term is
studied. Experiments on real data sets show that when orthogonality is used to
enforce robustness, the parameter multiplying the regularization termcan be
used to tune a tradeoff between accuracy and orthogonality, for the benefit of
both accuracy and robustness.Altogether, the study guarantees that the

humans is capable of continually learning concepts. On the contrary,
conventional deep learning models lack this capability of preserving previously
learned knowledge. When a neural network is fine-tuned to learn new tasks, its
performance on previously trained tasks will significantly deteriorate. Many
recent works on incremental object detection tackle this problem by introducing
advanced regularization. Although these methods have shown promising results,
the benefits are often short-lived after the first incremental step. Under
multi-step incremental learning, the trade-off between old knowledge preserving
and new task learning becomes progressively more severe. Thus, the performance
of regularization-based incremental object detectors gradually decays for
subsequent learning steps. In this paper, we aim to alleviate this performance
decay on multi-step incremental detection tasks by proposing a dilatable
incremental object detector (DIODE). For the task-shared parameters, our method
adaptively penalizes the changes of important weights for previous tasks. At
the same time, the structure of the model is dilated or expanded by a limited
number of task-specific parameters to promote new task learning. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets demonstrate substantial
improvements over the state-of-the-art methods. Notably, compared with the
state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves up to 6.0% performance
improvement by increasing the number of parameters by just 1.2% for each newly
learned task.

feature embedding subnetwork which is used for point cloud feature extraction

second subnetwork is region proposal network(RPN), which is used to get the
final 3D bounding box of the target object based on the fusion feature from
cross correlation modules. In this subnetwork, we utilize the regression and
classification branches of a region proposal subnetwork to obtain proposals and

real-world urban scenes, semantic segmentation for urban driving scenes
achieves significant progress. However, semantic segmentation for off-road,
unstructured environments is not widely studied. Directly applying existing
segmentation networks often results in performance degradation as they cannot
overcome intrinsic problems in such environments, such as illumination changes.
In this paper, a built-in memory module for semantic segmentation is proposed
to overcome these problems. The memory module stores significant
representations of training images as memory items. In addition to the encoder
embedding like items together, the proposed memory module is specifically
designed to cluster together instances of the same class even when there are
significant variances in embedded features. Therefore, it makes segmentation
networks better deal with unexpected illumination changes. A triplet loss is
used in training to minimize redundancy in storing discriminative
representations of the memory module. The proposed memory module is general so
that it can be adopted in a variety of networks. We conduct experiments on the
Robot Unstructured Ground Driving (RUGD) dataset and RELLIS dataset, which are
collected from off-road, unstructured natural environments. Experimental
results show that the proposed memory module improves the performance of
existing segmentation networks and contributes to capturing unclear objects
over various off-road, unstructured natural scenes with equivalent
computational cost and network parameters. As the proposed method can be
integrated into compact networks, it presents a viable approach for
resource-limited small autonomous platforms.

fluctuations during the early universe, are candidates for dark matter. When
microlensing background stars, they cause a transient apparent enhancement of
the flux. Measuring these signals with optical telescopes is a powerful method
to constrain the PBH abundance in the range of $10^{-10}\,M_{\odot}$ to
$10^{1}\,M_{\odot}$. Especially for galactic stars, the finiteness of the
sources needs to be taken into account. For low PBH masses (in this work
$\lesssim 10^{-8}\,M_{\odot}$) the average duration of the detectable event
decreases with the mass $\langle t_e\rangle \propto M_{\mathrm{PBH}}$. For
$M_{\mathrm{PBH}}\approx 10^{-11}\,M_{\odot}$ we find $\langle t_e\rangle
\lesssim\,1 \mathrm{s}$. For this reason, fast sampling detectors may be
required as they could enable the detection of low mass PBHs. Current limits
are set with sampling speeds of 2 minutes to 24 hours in the optical regime.
Ground-based Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) are optimized to
detect the $\sim$ns long optical Cherenkov signals induced by atmospheric air
showers. As shown recently, the very-large mirror area of these instruments
provides very high signal to noise ratio for fast optical transients ($\ll
1\,$s) such as asteroid occultations. We investigate whether optical
observations by IACTs can contribute to extending microlensing limits to the
unconstrained mass range $M_{\mathrm{PBH}}<10^{-10}M_\odot$. We discuss the
limiting factors to perform these searches for each telescope type. We
calculate the rate of expected detectable microlensing events in the relevant
mass range for the current and next-generation IACTs considering realistic
source parameters.

nucleus-nucleus collisions in CBM at FAIR. Real-size trapezoidal modules have
been installed in the mCBM experiment and tested in nucleus-nucleus collisions
at the SIS18 beamline of GSI as a part of the FAIR Phase-0 program. In this
report, we discuss the design, installation, commissioning, and response of
these GEM modules in detail. The response has been studied using the
free-streaming readout electronics designed for the CBM-MuCh and CBM-STS
detector system. In free-streaming data, the first attempt on an event building
based on the timestamps of hits has been carried out, resulting in the
observation of clear spatial correlations between the GEM modules in the mCBM
setup for the first time. Accordingly, a time resolution of $\sim$15\,ns have
been obtained for the GEM detectors.

document ranking for information retrieval, which first pre-train a general
language model on an unlabeled large corpus and then conduct ranking-specific
fine-tuning on expert-labeled relevance datasets. Ideally, an IR system would
model relevance from a user-system dualism: the user's view and the system's
view. User's view judges the relevance based on the activities of ""real users""
while the system's view focuses on the relevance signals from the system side,
e.g., from the experts or algorithms, etc. Inspired by the user-system
relevance views and the success of pre-trained language models, in this paper
we propose a novel ranking framework called Pre-Rank that takes both user's
view and system's view into consideration, under the pre-training and
fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, to model the user's view of relevance,
Pre-Rank pre-trains the initial query-document representations based on
large-scale user activities data such as the click log. To model the system's
view of relevance, Pre-Rank further fine-tunes the model on expert-labeled
relevance data. More importantly, the pre-trained representations, are
fine-tuned together with handcrafted learning-to-rank features under a wide and
deep network architecture. In this way, Pre-Rank can model the relevance by
incorporating the relevant knowledge and signals from both real search users
and the IR experts. To verify the effectiveness of Pre-Rank, we showed two
implementations by using BERT and SetRank as the underlying ranking model,
respectively. Experimental results base on three publicly available benchmarks
showed that in both of the implementations, Pre-Rank can respectively
outperform the underlying ranking models and achieved state-of-the-art

propose a mechanism of compressing the weight updates using Autoencoders (AE),
which learn the data features of the weight updates and subsequently perform
compression. The encoder is set up on each of the nodes where the training is

the weights at the end of every communication round using the decoder. This
paper shows that the dynamic and orthogonal AE based weight compression
technique could serve as an advantageous alternative (or an add-on) in a large

and beyond, but can also be modified based on the accuracy requirements,
computational capacity, and other requirements of the given FL setup.

wavelength-dependent variations plays an important role in high-precision
photometric, astrometric, and shape measurements of astronomical objects. Based
on the unique flat data of 47 narrow-band filters provided by JPAS-{\it
Pathfinder}, we analyze the variations of small-scale flats as a function of
wavelength. We find moderate variations (from about $1.0\%$ at 390 nm to
$0.3\%$ at 890 nm) of small-scale flats among different filters, increasing
towards shorter wavelengths. Small-scale flats of two filters close in central
wavelengths are strongly correlated. We then use a simple physical model to
reproduce the observed variations to a precision of about $\pm 0.14\%$, by
considering the variations of charge collection efficiencies, effective areas
and thicknesses between CCD pixels. We find that the wavelength-dependent
variations of small-scale flats of the JPAS-{\it Pathfinder} camera originate
from inhomogeneities of the quantum efficiency (particularly charge collection
efficiency) as well as the effective area and thickness of CCD pixels. The
former dominates the variations in short wavelengths while the latter two
dominate at longer wavelengths. The effects on proper flat-fielding as well as
on photometric/flux calibrations for photometric/slit-less spectroscopic
surveys are discussed, particularly in blue filters/wavelengths. We also find
that different model parameters are sensitive to flats of different
wavelengths, depending on the relations between the electron absorption depth,
the photon absorption length and the CCD thickness. In order to model the
wavelength-dependent variations of small-scale flats, a small number (around
ten) of small-scale flats with well-selected wavelengths are sufficient to
reconstruct small-scale flats in other wavelengths.

there are multiple possible human interactions in the same object region. To
address these problems, we propose a Hand-aided Affordance Grounding Network
(HAGNet) that leverages the aided clues provided by the position and action of
the hand in demonstration videos to eliminate the multiple possibilities and
better locate the interaction regions in the object. Specifically, HAG-Net has
a dual-branch structure to process the demonstration video and object image.
For the video branch, we introduce hand-aided attention to enhance the region

the action features. For the object branch, we introduce a semantic enhancement
module (SEM) to make the network focus on different parts of the object

output features of the object branch with that of the video branch and transfer
the knowledge in the video branch to the object branch. Quantitative and

achieved stateof-the-art results for affordance grounding. The source code will

Recently, it was shown that different model-agnostic nonconformity functions
result in conformal classifiers with different characteristics. For a Neural

allows minimizing the average number of predicted labels, and margin results in
a larger fraction of singleton predictions. In this work, we aim to further

its symbolic representation to a target listener. To further reach its full
potential, we additionally infuse contextual reasoning into SNC such that the
speaker locally and iteratively self-communicates with a virtual agent built on
the physical listener's unique way of coding its semantics, i.e., communication
context. The resultant System 2 SNC allows the speaker to extract the most
effective semantics for its listener. Leveraging the proposed stochastic model,
we show that the reliability of System 2 SNC increases with the number of

random graph theory. If $m$ is such that each edge of $G(n,m)$ belongs to a
copy of $H'$ for every $H' \subseteq H$, in expectation, then it is known that
$G(n,m)$ is $H$-free with probability $\exp(- \Theta(m))$. The KLR conjecture,
slightly rephrased, states that if we further condition on uniform edge
distribution, the archetypal property of random graphs, the probability of
being $H$-free becomes superexponentially small in the number of edges. While
being interesting on its own, the conjecture has received significant attention
due to its connection with the sparse regularity lemma, and the many results in
random graphs that follow. It was proven by Balogh, Morris, and Samotij and,

hypergraph containers method. We give a new direct proof using induction.

Gaar and Rendl enhanced semidefinite programming approaches to tighten the
upper bound given by the Lov\'asz theta function. This is done by carefully
selecting some so-called exact subgraph constraints (ESC) and adding them to
the semidefinite program of computing the Lov\'asz theta function.
  First, we provide two new relaxations that allow to compute the bounds faster
without substantial loss of the quality of the bounds. One of these two
relaxations is based on including violated facets of the polytope representing
the ESCs, the other one adds separating hyperplanes for that polytope.
  Furthermore, we implement a branch and bound (B&B) algorithm using these
tightened relaxations in our bounding routine. We compare the efficiency of our
B&B algorithm using the different upper bounds. It turns out that already the
bounds of Gaar and Rendl drastically reduce the number of nodes to be explored
in the B&B tree as compared to the Lov\'asz theta bound. However, this comes
with a high computational cost. Our new relaxations improve the run time of the
overall B&B algorithm, while keeping the number of nodes in the B&B tree small.

issues by the knowledge transfer from a label-rich source domain to a related

distributions of the two domains. However, the majority of them focus on the
entire image features where irrelevant semantic information, e.g., the messy
background, is inevitably embedded. Enforcing feature alignments in such case
will negatively influence the correct matching of objects and consequently lead
to the semantically negative transfer due to the confusion of irrelevant
semantics. To tackle this issue, we propose Semantic Concentration for Domain
Adaptation (SCDA), which encourages the model to concentrate on the most
principal features via the pair-wise adversarial alignment of prediction
distributions. Specifically, we train the classifier to class-wisely maximize
the prediction distribution divergence of each sample pair, which enables the
model to find the region with large differences among the same class of
samples. Meanwhile, the feature extractor attempts to minimize that
discrepancy, which suppresses the features of dissimilar regions among the same
class of samples and accentuates the features of principal parts. As a general
method, SCDA can be easily integrated into various DA methods as a regularizer
to further boost their performance. Extensive experiments on the cross-domain
benchmarks show the efficacy of SCDA.

analyse the alternative theory of classical mechanics presented by Gisin and

of as being only determined up to finite precision at each point in time, and
that doing so naturally leads to indeterminism. Next, we investigate whether we
can use intuitionistic mathematics to mathematically express the idea of finite
precision of quantities, arriving at the cautious conclusion that, as far as we
can see, such attempts are thwarted by conceptual contradictions. Finally, we
outline another approach to formalising finite-precision quantities in

down. More explicitly, sequences of generating orbits with increasingly
negative action and energies between $-\sqrt{2}$ and zero are constructed.
Using results from Bolotin and MacKay, it is shown that these generating orbits
extend to periodic solutions of the restricted three-body problem for small
mass ratios and the action remains within a small neighbourhood. These orbits
obstruct the existence of contact structures for energy level sets $\Sigma_c$
of the mentioned values and small mass ratios of the spatial problem. In the
planar case the constructed orbits are noncontractible even in the
Moser-regularised energy hypersurface $\overline{\Sigma}_c$. Here, the
constructed orbits still obstruct the existence of contact structures in
certain relative de Rham classes of $\overline{\Sigma}_c$ to the Liouville
1-form. These results are optimal in the sense that for energies above zero the
level sets are again contact for all mass ratios. Numerical results are
additionally given to visualise the computations and give evidence for the

radiation appears thermal and eventually leads to the complete disappearance of

The transition from such an initial state to the final state of pure Hawking
radiation cannot be described by unitary time evolution. In this paper, we
present an analysis in quantum gravity that shows how boundary conditions in
the future prevent a loss of quantum mechanical information from the spacetime.
In classical physics, the future boundary of the spacetime in the black hole
interior is a singularity. Realistic gravitational collapse results in a BKL
type of approach to the singularity. But, solving the Wheeler-DeWitt equation
reveals that the singularity does not form and can be replaced by specifying a
final state density matrix. Such a condition is natural within the context of
consistent histories version of quantum mechanics. We provide a self-contained
treatment of these issues. How information escapes from the black hole will be

short-term memory, so that their non-Markovianity is completely non-detectable
by any interventions up to an arbitrarily large time. Our results raise the
question about the assessibility of non-Markovianity: in principle,
non-Markovian effects that are perfectly elusive to interventions may emerge at
much later times.

determination of classical and quantum states, which reveals a fundamental gap
between classical and quantum world. For finite dimensional quantum system, a
particle moving in one spatial dimension is expressed as a pure quantum state
and projective measurements onto two special orthonormal bases are regarded as
the observations of position and momentum, which are not enough for the
uniquely determination of pure qudit states. In this paper, we focus on the
determination of all finite dimensional pure quantum states with projective
measurements onto two orthonormal bases. Firstly, a new orthonormal basis is
constructed for the replacement of discrete analogy of momentum, which can help
to filter out finite candidates among all pure qudit states with probability 1.
Then, the analogy bases for position and momentum are enough to determine
almost all pure qudits when introducing an adaptive POVM.

systems dual descriptions in terms of non-Hermitian staggered Ising
interactions in a conventional transverse field exist. We perform high-order
series expansions about the high- and low-field limit for both systems to
determine the ground-state energy per site and the one-particle gap. The
one-dimensional non-Hermitian Ising chain is known to be exactly solvable. Its
ground-state phase diagram consists of second-order quantum phase transitions,
which can be characterized by logarithmic singularities of the second
derivative of the ground-state energy and, in the symmetry-broken phase, the
gap closing of the low-field gap. In contrast, the gap closing from the
high-field phase is not accessible perturbatively due to the complex energy and
the occurrence of exceptional lines in the high-field gap expression. For the
two-dimensional toric code in a non-Hermitian staggered field we study the
quantum robustness of the topologically ordered phase by the gap closing of the
low-field gap. We find that the well-known second-order quantum phase
transition of the toric code in a uniform field extends into a large portion of
the non-Hermitian parameter space. However, the series expansions become
unreliable for a dominant anti-Hermitian field. Interestingly, the analysis of
the high-field gap reveals the potential presence of an intermediate region.

approximation algorithm, with a user controlled approximation error,
specifically, on the Bottleneck distance to the exact solution. Our approach is
based on a hierarchical representation of the input data, and relies on local
simplifications of the scalar field to accelerate the computation, while
maintaining a controlled bound on the output error. The locality of our
approach enables further speedups thanks to shared memory parallelism.
Experiments conducted on real life datasets show that for a mild error
tolerance (5% relative Bottleneck distance), our approach improves runtime
performance by 18% on average (and up to 48% on large, noisy datasets) in
comparison to standard, exact, publicly available implementations. In addition
to the strong guarantees on its approximation error, we show that our algorithm
also provides in practice outputs which are on average 5 times more accurate

Lyapunov exponent~($\lambda_{c}$) are explicitly derived to analyze the
stability of equatorial circular geodesics for the stringy BH spacetime with
\emph{electric charge} parameter ($\alpha$) and \emph{magnetic charge}
parameter~($Q$). By computing these exponents for both the cases of BH
spacetime, it is observed that the coordinate time Lyapunov exponent of
magnetically charged stringy BH for both timelike and null geodesics are
independent of magnetic charge parameter $(Q)$. The variation of the ratio of
Lyapunov exponents with radius of timelike circular orbits ($r_{0}/M$) for both
the cases of stringy BH are presented. The behavior of instability exponent for
null circular geodesics with respect to charge parameters ($\alpha$ and $Q$)
are also observed for both the cases of BH. Further, by establishing a relation
between quasinormal modes (QNMs) and parameters related to null circular
geodesics (like angular frequency and Lyapunov exponent), we deduced the QNMs
(or QNM frequencies) for a massless scalar field perturbation around
\emph{both} the cases of stringy BH spacetime in the eikonal limit. The
variation of scalar field potential with charge parameters and angular momentum
of perturbation ($l$) are visually presented and discussed accordingly.

interpretability, i.e., mapping the connectivity patterns of the relations
(i.e., symmetric/asymmetric, inverse, and composition) to a geometric
interpretation such as rotations. Other approaches model the representations in
higher dimensional space such as four-dimensional space (4D) to enhance the
ability to infer the connectivity patterns (i.e., expressiveness). However,
modeling relation and entity in a 4D space often comes at the cost of
interpretability. This paper proposes HopfE, a novel KGE approach aiming to
achieve the interpretability of inferred relations in the four-dimensional
space. We first model the structural embeddings in 3D Euclidean space and view
the relation operator as an SO(3) rotation. Next, we map the entity embedding
vector from a 3D space to a 4D hypersphere using the inverse Hopf Fibration, in
which we embed the semantic information from the KG ontology. Thus, HopfE
considers the structural and semantic properties of the entities without losing
expressivity and interpretability. Our empirical results on four well-known
benchmarks achieve state-of-the-art performance for the KG completion task.

The functions are assumed to be analytical and hence they have a convergent
Maclaurin series with infinity radius of convergence. Using Maclaurin series

infinite series in terms of Riemann zeta function. It is shown that the
infinite series is convergent under a certain condition and consequently the

astrophysical twin of the Earth, however its global cloud layer truncates

Observational indicators that can distinguish an exo-Venus from an exo-Earth
must therefore survive above the cloud layer. The above-cloud atmosphere is
dominated by photochemistry, which depends on the spectrum of the host star and
therefore changes between stellar systems. We explore the systematic changes in
photochemistry above the clouds of Venus-like exoplanets orbiting K-Dwarf or
M-Dwarf host stars, using a recently validated model of the full Venus
atmosphere (0-115 km) and stellar spectra from the MUSCLES Treasury survey.
SO2, OCS and H2S are key gas species in Venus-like planets that are not present
in Earth-like planets, and could therefore act as observational discriminants
if their atmospheric abundances are high enough to be detected. We find that
SO2, OCS and H2S all survive above the cloud layer when irradiated by the
coolest K-Dwarf and all seven M-Dwarfs, whereas these species are heavily
photochemically depleted above the clouds of Venus. The production of sulfuric
acid molecules that form the cloud layer decreases for decreasing stellar
effective temperature. Less steady-state photochemical oxygen and ozone forms
with decreasing stellar effective temperature, and the effect of
chlorine-catalysed reaction cycles diminish in favour of HOx and SOx catalysed
cycles. We conclude that trace sulfur gases will be prime observational

to promote radial cracks in the polymer matrix which facilitate the ingress of

different types of industrial applications. The generally high cost of (AUVs)
restricts the access to them and therefore advances in research and
technological development. However, recent advances have led to lower cost
commercially available Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), which present a
platform that can be enhanced to enable a high degree of autonomy, similar to
that of a high-end (AUV). In this article, we present how a low-cost
commercial-off-the-shelf (ROV) can be used as a foundation for developing

modifications to obtain a system capable of autonomous operations as well as
the necessary software modules. Additionally, we present a set of use cases

an AI agent to perceive its surrounding environment. While significant progress
has been achieved with expensive LiDAR point clouds, it poses a great challenge
for 3D object detection given only a monocular image. While there exist
different alternatives for tackling this problem, it is found that they are
either equipped with heavy networks to fuse RGB and depth information or
empirically ineffective to process millions of pseudo-LiDAR points. With
in-depth examination, we realize that these limitations are rooted in
inaccurate object localization. In this paper, we propose a novel and
lightweight approach, dubbed {\em Progressive Coordinate Transforms} (PCT) to
facilitate learning coordinate representations. Specifically, a localization
boosting mechanism with confidence-aware loss is introduced to progressively
refine the localization prediction. In addition, semantic image representation
is also exploited to compensate for the usage of patch proposals. Despite being
lightweight and simple, our strategy leads to superior improvements on the
KITTI and Waymo Open Dataset monocular 3D detection benchmarks. At the same
time, our proposed PCT shows great generalization to most coordinate-based 3D
detection frameworks. The code is available at:

lifting to prevent back injury is increasingly being challenged by recent
biomechanical evidence. However, most of these studies only focus on very
localized parameters such as lumbar spine flexion, while evaluations of
whole-body lifting strategies are largely lacking. For this reason, a novel
index, the Stoop-Squat-Index, was developed, which describes the proportion
between trunk forward lean and lower extremity joint flexion, with possible
values ranging from 0 (full squat lifting) to 100 (full stoop lifting). To
enable the interpretation of the index in a real-life setting, normative values
were established using motion capture data from 30 healthy pain-free
individuals that were collected in the context of a previous study. The results
showed mean index values of lower than 30 and higher than 90 for the most
relevant phases of the squat and stoop movements, respectively, with mean index
values differing significantly from each other for the full duration of the
lifting phases. The main advantages of the index are that it is simple to
calculate and can not only be derived from motion capture data but also from
conventional video recordings, which enables large-scale in-field measurements
with relatively low expenditure. When used in combination with lumbar spine
flexion measurements, the index can contribute important information, which is
necessary for comprehensively evaluating whole-body lifting strategies and to
shed more light on the debate over the connection between lifting posture and

drawback of these models is that they can work only on the parametrized
geometric features they were trained with. This study evaluates if deep
learning models can predict the drag coefficient for an arbitrary input
geometry without explicit parameterization. We use two similar data sets based
on the publicly available DrivAer geometry for training. We use a modified
U-Net architecture that uses Signed Distance Fields to represent the input
geometries. Our models outperform the existing models by at least 11% in
prediction accuracy for the drag coefficient. We achieved this improvement by
combining multiple data sets that were created using different
parameterizations, which is not possible with the methods currently used. We
have also shown that it is possible to predict velocity fields and drag
coefficient concurrently and that simple data augmentation methods can improve
the results. In addition, we have performed an occlusion sensitivity study on
our models to understand what information is used to make predictions. From the
occlusion sensitivity study, we showed that the models were able to identify
the geometric features and have discovered that the model has learned to
exploit the global information present in the SDF. In contrast to the currently
operational method, where design changes are restricted to the initially
defined parameters, this study brings surrogate models one step closer to the
long-term goal of having a model that can be used for approximate aerodynamic
evaluation of unseen, arbitrary vehicle shapes, thereby providing complete

gas parcel falls into the filament, it will experience different density,
temperature, and extinction values. The rate at which this environment changes
will affect differently the abundance of different molecules. So, a molecule
that forms quickly will better reflect the local physical conditions a gas
parcel experiences than a slower-forming molecule. Since these differences
depend on how the respective timescales compare, the different molecular
distributions should reflect how rapidly the environment changes, i.e., the
accretion rate toward the filament. We find that the filament widths measured
from time-dependent abundances for C2H, CO, CN, CS, and C3H2, are sensitive the
most to this effect, being those molecules the ones presenting also the wider
filament widths. On the contrary, molecules such as N2H+, NH3, H2CO, HNC or

widths. We propose that ratios of filament widths for different tracers could

Majorana model without charge conservation and the complex model with charge
conservation, and demonstrate that in both models taking the random average of
the couplings gives rise to emergent symmetry structures. The random averaging
exactly maps the operator dynamics of the Majorana model and the complex model
to the imaginary time dynamics of an SU(2) spin and an SU(4) spin respectively,
which become solvable in the large $N$ limit. Furthermore, the symmetry
structure drastically reduces the size of the Hilbert space required to
calculate the OTOC from exponential to linear in $N$, providing full access to
the operator dynamics at all times for large finite $N$. In the case of the
complex model with charge conservation, using this approach, we obtain the OTOC
within each charge sector both numerically at finite $N$ and analytically in
the large $N$ limit. We find that the time scale of the scrambling dynamics for
all times and in each sector is characterized by the charge density.
Furthermore, after proper rescaling, the OTOC corresponding to different finite
charge densities collapses into a single curve at large finite $N$. In the
large $N$ limit, the rescaled OTOCs at finite density are described by the same
hydrodynamic equation as in the Majorana case.

into independent batch jobs and (2) simulated across any number of
heterogeneous machines - all without affecting the simulation result.
  We use the Rust programming language to build the extensible and statically
checked simulation package $\texttt{necsim-rust}$. We evaluate our
parallelisation approach by comparing three traditional simulation algorithms
against a CPU and GPU implementation of our Independent algorithm. These
experiments show that as long as some local state is maintained to cull
redundant individuals, our Independent algorithm is as efficient as existing
sequential solutions. The GPU implementation further outperforms all algorithms
on the CPU by a factor ranging from $\sim 2$ to $\sim 80$, depending on the
model parameterisation and the analysis that is performed. Amongst the parallel
algorithms we have investigated, our Independent algorithm provides the only
non-approximate parallelisation strategy that can scale to large simulation
domains.

pattern, and is closely related to the economic situation and social
environment of the city. In Hong Kong, for example, July, August, and October
tend to be the peak season of traffic flow, while there is also a relatively
fixed off-season. In the case of a stable social environment, a carefully
identified and fitted seasonal ARIMA model can predict the traffic flow in the
future months well. This work selects the air traffic data, including arrival
and departure passengers of Hong Kong, after the financial crisis and before
the political storm. A sparse seasonal ARIMA$(0,1,1)\times(4,1,0)_{12}$ is
built, which can correctly predict the air traffic from January to July in 2020
within its $95\%$ confidence interval. Furthermore, this work decomposes the
time-series and find that important events, like the financial crisis,
political storm, and the COVID-19 outbreak, affect the level of air traffic to
some extent. For example, the political storm and epidemic prevention and
control that happened after 2019 made the air traffic drop significantly.
According to my sparse seasonal ARIMA model, the air traffic from February to
November in 2020 is only $5\%$ of what it should be without these two events.
This is a valuable application of the time-series model in the air traffic loss
estimation.

mixing mechanism automatically generates a millicharge for the hidden sector
dark fermions providing a theoretical basis for using millicharged dark matter

lattice QCD input for the gluon and ghost propagators. We observe significant
dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and a mass gap that leads to a constituent
mass of the order of 500 MeV for the light quarks. The flavor dependence of the

sufficient number of $e$-folds. To be consistent with observations at least 60

set of functions among which the classifier is chosen. We study a family of
low-complexity classifiers consisting of thresholding a random one-dimensional
feature. The feature is obtained by projecting the data on a random line after
embedding it into a higher-dimensional space parametrized by monomials of order
up to k. More specifically, the extended data is projected n-times and the best
classifier among those n, based on its performance on training data, is chosen.
We show that this type of classifier is extremely flexible, as it is likely to
approximate, to an arbitrary precision, any continuous function on a compact
set as well as any boolean function on a compact set that splits the support
into measurable subsets. In particular, given full knowledge of the class
conditional densities, the error of these low-complexity classifiers would
converge to the optimal (Bayes) error as k and n go to infinity. On the other
hand, if only a training dataset is given, we show that the classifiers will
perfectly classify all the training points as k and n go to infinity. We also
bound the generalization error of our random classifiers. In general, our
bounds are better than those for any classifier with VC dimension greater than
O (ln n) . In particular, our bounds imply that, unless the number of
projections n is extremely large, there is a significant advantageous gap
between the generalization error of the random projection approach and that of
a linear classifier in the extended space. Asymptotically, as the number of
samples approaches infinity, the gap persists for any such n. Thus, there is a
potentially large gain in generalization properties by selecting parameters at
random, rather than optimization.

initiation technique for labeled random finite set filters. A naive
construction of the multi-sensor measurement adaptive birth set distribution
leads to an exponential number of newborn components in the number of sensors.
A truncation criterion is established for a labeled multi-Bernoulli random
finite set birth density. The proposed truncation criterion is shown to have a
bounded L1 error in the generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli posterior density.
This criterion is used to construct a Gibbs sampler that produces a truncated
measurement-generated labeled multi-Bernoulli birth distribution with quadratic
complexity in the number of sensors. A closed-form solution of the conditional
sampling distribution assuming linear Gaussian likelihoods is provided,
alongside an approximate solution using Monte Carlo importance sampling.
Multiple simulation results are provided to verify the efficacy of the
truncation criterion, as well as the reduction in complexity.

"2109.09456","Soomin Woo","Soomin Woo","Multi-modal Matching Problem of Shared Mobility",,,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Rideshare is one way to share mobility in transportation without increasing
traffic demand, where travel mobility and usage of vehicle capacity can be
improved. However, current literature on rideshare has allowed only one-modal
trips and may be limited in the matching efficiency, especially when there is a
large gap between the supply and demand of mobility. Therefore, the objectives
of this paper are first to develop a multi-modal matching framework of shared
mobility with public transportation to maximize the performance of a rideshare
system, and second to evaluate the effect of the public transportation and of
the schedule flexibility on the matching efficiency. To fulfill the first
objective, a multi-modal matching framework is developed to allow rideshare
with both private and public vehicles with detailed design of detour, using
Genetic Algorithm. Also for the second objective, the effects of public
transportation and schedule flexibility are evaluated with a simplified network
of Sioux Falls. The results show that public transportation helps the match
rate slightly at a low supply of private vehicle, but this must be evaluated
for practical implementation as different cities may bring different results.
Also, a larger schedule flexibility helps greatly in increasing match rate even
at a lower supply level. As well, the planning subject of time schedule is
benefited more with larger schedule flexibility, in this paper the drivers, on
the matching efficiency. Moreover, a rideshare system with private vehicles
outperforms a public transportation system, possibly due to the rigid route of
public transportation that takes no detour burden. This confirms the need for a
flexible design of sharing mobility, as can be fulfilled with the multi-modal
matching framework developed in this research.
