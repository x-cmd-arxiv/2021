for online marketing, which demands automatic approaches to understand the
contents of advertisements effectively. Taking the 2021 TAAC competition as an
opportunity, we developed a multimodal system to improve the ability of
structured analysis of advertising video content. In our framework, we break
down the video structuring analysis problem into two tasks, i.e., scene
segmentation and multi-modal tagging. In scene segmentation, we build upon a
temporal convolution module for temporal modeling to predict whether adjacent
frames belong to the same scene. In multi-modal tagging, we first compute
clip-level visual features by aggregating frame-level features with
NeXt-SoftDBoF. The visual features are further complemented with textual
features that are derived using a global-local attention mechanism to extract
useful information from OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and ASR (Audio
Speech Recognition) outputs. Our solution achieved a score of 0.2470 measured
in consideration of localization and prediction accuracy, ranking fourth in the
2021 TAAC final leaderboard.

  Augmented with Curriculum Learning and Sim2Real",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traversing through a tilted narrow gap is previously an intractable task for
reinforcement learning mainly due to two challenges. First, searching feasible
trajectories is not trivial because the goal behind the gap is difficult to
reach. Second, the error tolerance after Sim2Real is low due to the relatively
high speed in comparison to the gap's narrow dimensions. This problem is
aggravated by the intractability of collecting real-world data due to the risk
of collision damage. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement
learning framework that solves this task successfully by addressing both
problems. To search for dynamically feasible flight trajectories, we use
curriculum learning to guide the agent towards the sparse reward behind the
obstacle. To tackle the Sim2Real problem, we propose a Sim2Real framework that
can transfer control commands to a real quadrotor without using real flight
data. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first work that
accomplishes successful gap traversing task purely using deep reinforcement
learning.

motions is obtained from a collection of 2D images. Almost all methods in the
literature solve for the rotations separately, through rotation averaging
process, and use them for solving the positions. Obtaining positions is the
challenging part because the translation observations only tell the direction

storage applications based on the numerical solution of the Ginzburg-Landau
equation with electrochemical or semiconducting boundary conditions. MOBO is a
low computational cost optimization tool for expensive multi-objective
functions, where we update posterior surrogate Gaussian process models from
prior evaluations, and then select future evaluations from maximizing an
acquisition function. Using the parameters for a prototype bulk
antiferroelectric (PbZrO3), we first develop a physics-driven decision tree of
target functions from the loop structures. We further develop a physics-driven
MOBO architecture to explore multidimensional parameter space and build
Pareto-frontiers by maximizing two target functions jointly: energy storage and
loss. This approach allows for rapid initial materials and device parameter
selection for a given application and can be further expanded towards the
active experiment setting. The associated notebooks provide both the tutorial
on MOBO and allow to reproduce the reported analyses and apply them to other
systems (https://github.com/arpanbiswas52/MOBO_AFI_Supplements).

random environment. While exact performance analysis is difficult, we establish
diffusion approximations to the (re-scaled) number-in-system process by proving
functional central limit theorems (FCLTs) using a stochastic homogenization
framework. This framework permits the establishment of quenched and annealed
limits in a unified manner. At the quantitative level, we identity two
parameter regimes, termed subcritical and supercritical indicating the relative
dominance between the two underlying stochasticities driving our system: the
randomness in the arrival intensity and that in the serivce times. We show that
while quenched FCLTs can only be established in the subcritical regime,
annealed FCLTs can be proved in both cases. Furthermore, the limiting
diffusions in the annealed FCLTs display qualitatively different diffusivity
properties in the two regimes, even though the stochastic primitives are
identical. In particular, when the service time distribution is heavy-tailed,
the diffusion is sub- and super-diffusive in the sub- and super-critical cases.
The results illustrate intricate interactions between the underlying driving
forces of our system.

known distributions, and presented in a uniformly random order. A
decision-maker must accept or reject each value when it is presented, and may

sum of accepted values.
  We analyze the performance of static threshold policies, which accept the
first $k$ values exceeding a fixed threshold (or all such values, if fewer than
$k$ exist). We show that an appropriate threshold guarantees $\gamma_k = 1 -
e^{-k}k^k/k!$ times the value of the offline optimal solution. Note that
$\gamma_1 = 1-1/e$, and by Stirling's approximation $\gamma_k \approx
1-1/\sqrt{2 \pi k}$. This represents the best-known guarantee for the prophet
secretary problem for all $k>1$, and is tight for all $k$ for the class of
static threshold policies.
  We provide two simple methods for setting the threshold. Our first method
sets a threshold such that $k \cdot \gamma_k$ values are accepted in
expectation, and offers an optimal guarantee for all $k$. Our second sets a
threshold such that the expected number of values exceeding the threshold is
equal to $k$. This approach gives an optimal guarantee if $k > 4$, but gives
sub-optimal guarantees for $k \le 4$. Our proofs use a new result for
optimizing sums of independent Bernoulli random variables, which extends a
classical result of Hoeffding (1956) and is likely to be of independent
interest. Finally, we note that our methods for setting thresholds can be
implemented under limited information about agents' values.

to translate an input semantic layout to a realistic image. One open challenge
widely observed in existing methods is the lack of effective semantic
constraints during the image translation process, leading to models that cannot
preserve the semantic information and ignore the semantic dependencies within
the same object. To address this issue, we propose a novel Double Pooing GAN
(DPGAN) for generating photo-realistic and semantically-consistent results from
the input layout. We also propose a novel Double Pooling Module (DPM), which
consists of the Square-shape Pooling Module (SPM) and the Rectangle-shape
Pooling Module (RPM). Specifically, SPM aims to capture short-range semantic
dependencies of the input layout with different spatial scales, while RPM aims
to capture long-range semantic dependencies from both horizontal and vertical
directions. We then effectively fuse both outputs of SPM and RPM to further
enlarge the receptive field of our generator. Extensive experiments on five
popular datasets show that the proposed DPGAN achieves better results than
state-of-the-art methods. Finally, both SPM and SPM are general and can be
seamlessly integrated into any GAN-based architectures to strengthen the

when dealing with large-scale systems. To address this, Information Retrieval
(IR) techniques are increasingly being used to suggest potential buggy source
code locations, for given bug reports. While IR techniques are very scalable,
in practice their effectiveness in accurately localizing bugs in a software
system remains low. Results of empirical studies suggest that the effectiveness
of bug localization techniques can be augmented by the configuration of queries
used to locate buggy code. However, in most IR-based bug localization
techniques, presented by researchers, the impact of the queries' configurations
is not fully considered. In a similar vein, techniques consider all code
elements as equally suspicious of being buggy while localizing bugs, but this
is not always the case either.In this paper, we present a new method-level,
information-retrieval-based bug localization technique called ``BoostNSift''.
BoostNSift exploits the important information in queries by `boost'ing that
information, and then `sift's the identified code elements, based on a novel
technique that emphasizes the code elements' specific relatedness to a bug
report over its generic relatedness to all bug reports. To evaluate the
performance of BoostNSift, we employed a state-of-the-art empirical design that
has been commonly used for evaluating file level IR-based bug localization
techniques: 6851 bugs are selected from commonly used Eclipse, AspectJ, SWT,

describe such atmospheres. In this article, expanding on the work by Li et al.
(2018), we generalize the single-component moist pseudoadiabat derivation in
Pierrehumbert (2010) to allow for multiple condensing components of arbitrary
diluteness and retained condensate fraction. The introduction of a freely
tunable retained condensate fraction allows for a flexible, self-consistent
treatment of atmospheres with non-dilute condensable components. To test the
pseudoadiabat's capabilities for simulating a diverse range of climates, we
apply the formula to planetary atmospheres with compositions, surface
pressures, and temperatures representing important stages with condensable-rich
atmospheres in the evolution of terrestrial planets: a magma ocean planet in a
runaway greenhouse state; a post-impact, late veneer-analogue planet with a
complex atmospheric composition; and an Archean Earth-like planet near the
outer edge of the classical circumstellar habitable zone. We find that
variations in the retention of multiple non-dilute condensable species can
significantly affect the lapse rate and in turn outgoing radiation and the
spectral signatures of planetary atmospheres. The presented formulation allows
for a more comprehensive treatment of the climate evolution of rocky exoplanets

formation of organic dust below 1200 km. Current models cannot fully explain
the observed electron temperature in this dusty environment. To achieve new
insight, we have re-analyzed the data taken in the ionosphere of Titan by the
Cassini Langmuir probe (LP), part of the Radio and Plasma Wave Science package.
A first paper (Chatain et al., 2021) introduces the new analysis method and
discusses the identification of 4 electron populations produced by different
ionization mechanisms. In this second paper, we present a statistical study of
the whole LP dataset below 1200 km which gives clues on the origin of the 4
populations. One small population is attributed to photo- or secondary
electrons emitted from the surface of the probe boom. A second population is
systematically observed, at a constant density (~500 cm-3), and is attributed
to background thermalized electrons from the ionization process of
precipitating particles fom the surrounding magnetosphere. The two last
populations increase in density with pressure, solar illumination and EUV flux.
The third population is observed with varying densities at all altitudes and
solar zenith angles except on the far nightside (SZA > ~140{\deg}), with a
maximum density of 2700 cm-3. It is therefore certainly related to the
photo-ionization of the atmospheric molecules. Finally, a fourth population

value-based methods to CRL, a recent groundbreaking line of game-theoretic
approaches uses the mixed policy that randomizes among a set of carefully
generated policies to converge to the desired constraint-satisfying policy.
However, these approaches require storing a large set of policies, which is not
policy efficient, and may incur prohibitive memory costs in constrained deep
RL. To address this problem, we propose an alternative approach. Our approach
first reformulates the CRL to an equivalent distance optimization problem. With
a specially designed linear optimization oracle, we derive a meta-algorithm
that solves it using any off-the-shelf RL algorithm and any conditional
gradient (CG) type algorithm as subroutines. We then propose a new variant of
the CG-type algorithm, which generalizes the minimum norm point (MNP) method.
The proposed method matches the convergence rate of the existing game-theoretic
approaches and achieves the worst-case optimal policy efficiency. The
experiments on a navigation task show that our method reduces the memory costs
by an order of magnitude, and meanwhile achieves better performance,
demonstrating both its effectiveness and efficiency.

present NeuroCartography, an interactive system that scalably summarizes and
visualizes concepts learned by neural networks. It automatically discovers and
groups neurons that detect the same concepts, and describes how such neuron
groups interact to form higher-level concepts and the subsequent predictions.
NeuroCartography introduces two scalable summarization techniques: (1) neuron
clustering groups neurons based on the semantic similarity of the concepts
detected by neurons (e.g., neurons detecting ""dog faces"" of different breeds
are grouped); and (2) neuron embedding encodes the associations between related
concepts based on how often they co-occur (e.g., neurons detecting ""dog face""
and ""dog tail"" are placed closer in the embedding space). Key to our scalable
techniques is the ability to efficiently compute all neuron pairs'
relationships, in time linear to the number of neurons instead of quadratic
time. NeuroCartography scales to large data, such as the ImageNet dataset with
1.2M images. The system's tightly coordinated views integrate the scalable
techniques to visualize the concepts and their relationships, projecting the
concept associations to a 2D space in Neuron Projection View, and summarizing
neuron clusters and their relationships in Graph View. Through a large-scale
human evaluation, we demonstrate that our technique discovers neuron groups

field. The goal is to move the robots from initial locations to target
locations such that they follow shortest non-colliding paths in the shortest

real-time algorithm for dense and complex 2D and 3D environments is proposed.
This algorithm uses angular calculations to select the optimal direction for
the movement of each robot and it has been shown that these separate
calculations lead to a form of cooperative behavior among agents. We evaluated
the proposed approach on various simulation and experimental scenarios and
compared the results with FMP and ORCA, two important algorithms in this field.
The results show that the proposed approach is at least 25% faster than ORCA

proposed method is shown to enable fully autonomous navigation of a swarm of

to assess equivalence of quantitative measurement techniques. It has been
widely applied, however often misinterpreted by lacking of inferential
statistical support. We aim to develop and distribute a statistical method in R
in order to add robust and suitable inferential statistics of equivalence.
Methods: Three nested tests based on structural regressions are proposed to
assess the equivalence of structural means (accuracy), equivalence of
structural variances (precision), and concordance with the structural bisector
line (agreement in measurements of data pairs obtained from the same subject)
to reach statistical support for the equivalence of measurement techniques.
Graphical outputs illustrating these three tests were added to follow Bland and
Altman's principles of easy communication. Results: Statistical p-values and
robust approach by bootstrapping with corresponding graphs provide objective,
robust measures of equivalence. Five pairs of data sets were analyzed in order
to criticize previously published articles that applied the Bland and Altman's
principles, thus showing the suitability of the present statistical approach.
In one case it was demonstrated strict equivalence, three cases showed partial
equivalence, and one case showed poor equivalence. Package containing open
codes and data is available with installation instructions on GitHub for free
distribution. Conclusions: Statistical p-values and robust approach assess the
equivalence of accuracy, precision, and agreement for measurement techniques.
Decomposition in three tests helps the location of any disagreement as a means
to fix a new technique.

transmission rates and averting secondary infection risk before symptom onset
and by asymptomatic cases. The effectiveness of this contact tracing strategy
to mitigate transmission is sensitive to the adherence to quarantines, which
may be lower for longer quarantine periods or in vaccinated populations (where
perceptions of risk are reduced). This study develops a simulation model to
evaluate contact tracing strategies based on the sequential testing of
identified contacts after exposure as an alternative to quarantines, in which
contacts are isolated only after confirmation by a positive test. The analysis
considers different number and types of tests (PCR and lateral flow antigen
tests (LFA)) to identify the cost-effective testing policies that minimize the
expected infecting days post-exposure considering different levels of testing
capacity. This analysis suggests that even a limited number of tests can be
effective at reducing secondary infection risk: two LFA tests (with optimal
timing) avert infectiousness at a level that is comparable to 14-day quarantine
with 80-90% adherence, or equivalently, 7-9 day quarantine with full adherence
(depending on the sensitivity of the LFA test). Adding a third test (PCR or
LFA) reaches the efficiency of a 14-day quarantine with 90-100% adherence.
These results are robust to the exposure dates of the contact, test sensitivity
of LFA and alternative models of viral load evolution, which suggests that
simple testing rules can be effective for improving contact tracing in settings
where strict quarantine adherence is difficult to implement.

the physical flow features corresponding to this statistical signature in the
inertial subrange. The present study uses boundary layer turbulence
measurements to evaluate the self-similar geometric properties of velocity
isosurfaces and investigate their influence on statistics for the velocity
signal. The fractal dimension of streamwise velocity isosurfaces, indicating
statistical self-similarity in the size of ""wrinkles"" along each isosurface, is
shown to be constant only within the inertial subrange of scales. For the
transition between the inertial subrange and production range, it is inferred
that the largest wrinkles become increasingly confined by the overall size of
large-scale coherent velocity regions such as uniform momentum zones. The
self-similarity of isosurfaces yields power law trends in subsequent
one-dimensional statistics. For instance, the theoretical 2/3 power law
exponent for the structure function can be recovered by considering the
collective behavior of numerous isosurface level sets. The results suggest that
the physical presence of inertial subrange eddies is manifested in the

networks feasible was the adoption of the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
activation function to alleviate the vanishing gradient problem caused by using
saturating activation functions. Since then, many improved variants of the ReLU
activation have been proposed. However, a majority of activation functions used
today are non-oscillatory and monotonically increasing due to their biological

improve gradient flow and reduce network size. Two theorems on limits of
non-oscillatory activation functions are presented. A new oscillatory
activation function called Growing Cosine Unit(GCU) defined as $C(z) = z\cos z$
that outperforms Sigmoids, Swish, Mish and ReLU on a variety of architectures

single GCU neurons to have multiple hyperplanes in the decision boundary. This
allows single GCU neurons to learn the XOR function without feature

develop a corresponding privacy mechanism, Selective-DPSGD, for RNN-based

past decade, the first-principles phonon calculations using density functional

predicting the thermal conductivity of new materials. However, first-principles
calculations are too costly for high-throughput material screening and
multi-scale structural design. First-principles calculations also face several
fundamental challenges in modeling thermal transport properties, e.g., of
crystalline materials with defects, of amorphous materials, and for materials
at high temperatures. In the past five years, machine learning started to play
a role in solving these challenges. This review provides a comprehensive

remaining challenges in implementing machine learning for studying thermal
conductivity. After an introduction to the working principles of machine
learning and descriptors of material structures, recent research using machine
learning to study thermal transport is discussed. Three major applications of
machine learning for predicting thermal properties are discussed. First,
machine learning is applied to solve the challenges in modeling phonon
transport of crystals with defects, in amorphous materials, and at high
temperatures. Machine learning is used to build high-fidelity interatomic
potentials to bridge the gap between first-principles calculations and
molecular dynamics simulations. Second, machine learning can be used to study
the correlation between thermal conductivity and other properties for
high-throughput materials screening. Finally, machine learning is a powerful
tool for structural design to achieve target thermal conductance or thermal

enhances the $(\pi,\pi)$ spin fluctuations but only enhances (suppresses) the

algorithms has been shown to be dependent on the audio features chosen to
represent the audio. Some approaches have proposed learning feature
transformations from music segment annotation data, although, such data is time
consuming or expensive to create and as such these approaches are likely
limited by the size of their datasets. While annotated music segmentation data
is a scarce resource, the amount of available music audio is much greater. In
the neighboring field of semantic audio unsupervised deep learning has shown
promise in improving the performance of solutions to the query-by-example and
sound classification tasks. In this work, unsupervised training of deep feature
embeddings using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is explored for music
segmentation. The proposed techniques exploit only the time proximity of audio
features that is implicit in any audio timeline. Employing these embeddings in

designing both streams as well as the in-between fusion blocks is a daunting
task, requiring to explore a tremendously large design space. Such manual
exploration is time-consuming and often ends up with sub-optimal architectures
when computational resources are limited and the exploration is insufficient.
In this work, we present a pragmatic neural architecture search approach, which
is able to search for two-stream video models in giant spaces efficiently. We
design a multivariate search space, including 6 search variables to capture a
wide variety of choices in designing two-stream models. Furthermore, we propose
a progressive search procedure, by searching for the architecture of individual

demonstrate two-stream models with significantly better performance can be

On Kinetics, compared with the SlowFast model, our Auto-TSNet-L model reduces

generation. The lack of standardized benchmarks makes it difficult to assess
these abilities of a model and fairly compare different models, especially
Chinese models. Therefore, we propose a story-centric benchmark named LOT for

an encoder-decoder-based Chinese long text pretraining model named LongLM with

generative tasks including text infilling and conditional continuation.
Extensive experiments show that LongLM outperforms similar-sized pretraining

neural machine translation. Its core motivation is to simulate the inference

scheduled sampling is merely based on training steps and equally treats all
decoding steps. Namely, it simulates an inference scene with uniform error
rates, which disobeys the real inference scene, where larger decoding steps
usually have higher error rates due to error accumulations. To alleviate the
above discrepancy, we propose scheduled sampling methods based on decoding
steps, increasing the selection chance of predicted tokens with the growth of
decoding steps. Consequently, we can more realistically simulate the inference
scene during training, thus better bridging the gap between training and
inference. Moreover, we investigate scheduled sampling based on both training
steps and decoding steps for further improvements. Experimentally, our

scheduled sampling on three large-scale WMT tasks. Additionally, our approaches
also generalize well to the text summarization task on two popular benchmarks.

it has received interest from both vision and machine learning communities.
Existing approaches address this problem as a direct image-to-image translation
task. In this work, we innovate to explore the generation of font glyphs as 2D
graphic objects with the graph as an intermediate representation, so that more
intrinsic graphic properties of font styles can be captured. Specifically, we
formulate a cross-modality cycled image-to-image model structure with a graph
constructor between an image encoder and an image renderer. The novel graph
constructor maps a glyph's latent code to its graph representation that matches
expert knowledge, which is trained to help the translation task. Our model

ambiguous supervision in foreground, we involve extra correspondence prior with
a flow-depth consistency loss. The dense 2D correspondence of optical flows is
used to regularize the 3D stereo correspondence in MVS. To handle the invalid
supervision in background, we use Monte-Carlo Dropout to acquire the
uncertainty map and further filter the unreliable supervision signals on
invalid regions. Extensive experiments on DTU and Tank&Temples benchmark show
that our U-MVS framework achieves the best performance among unsupervised MVS

exhibit systematic improvement towards the basis set limit as well as good
transferability based on application to a total of 43 simple semiconductors.
Most notably, we found the BSIE of unc-def2-QZVP-GTH to be smaller than 0.7
m$E_h$ per atom in total energies and 20 meV in band gaps for all systems
considered here. Using unc-def2-QZVP-GTH, we report band gap benchmarks of a
combinatorially designed meta generalized gradient functional (mGGA), B97M-rV,
and show that B97M-rV performs similarly (a root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD)
of 1.18 eV) to other modern mGGA functionals, M06-L (1.26 eV), MN15-L (1.29
eV), and SCAN (1.20 eV). This represents a clear improvement over older pure
functionals such as LDA (1.71 eV) and PBE (1.49 eV) though all these mGGAs are
still far from being quantitatively accurate. We also provide several
cautionary notes on the use of our uncontracted bases and on future research on
GTO basis set development for solids.

  Our main result establishes an approximation-preserving equivalence of PB to

than their non-UDG counterparts, i.e., they are more oblate, or diskier. This
is in line with previous results that adopted the same UDG definition and
showed that isolated UDGs form via early, high spin mergers. However, the
choice of UDG definition can drastically affect what subset of a dwarf
population are classified as UDGs, changing the number of UDGs by up to ~45% of
the dwarf population. We also find that a galaxy's classification as a UDG is
dependent on its viewing orientation, and this dependence decreases as
environmental density increases. Overall, we conclude that some definitions for
UDG used in the literature manage to isolate a specific formation mechanism for
isolated dwarfs, while less restrictive definitions erase a link to formation
mechanism. Thus, how we define UDG populations must be considered if we want to
understand the formation and evolution of UDGs.

strategies and game-specific knowledge, which are modeled independently in
modern multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms. In this work, our focus
is on creating agents that can generalize across population-varying MGs.
Instead of learning a unimodal policy, each agent learns a policy set
comprising effective strategies across a variety of games. To achieve this, we
propose Meta Representations for Agents (MRA) that explicitly models the
game-common and game-specific strategic knowledge. By representing the policy
sets with multi-modal latent policies, the game-common strategic knowledge and
diverse strategic modes are discovered through an iterative optimization
procedure. We prove that by approximately maximizing the resulting constrained
mutual information objective, the policies can reach Nash Equilibrium in every
evaluation MG when the latent space is sufficiently large. When deploying MRA
in practical settings with limited latent space sizes, fast adaptation can be
achieved by leveraging the first-order gradient information. Extensive

and careful stability analysis, we can show that the time step can be chosen
not to depend on the contrast or scale as the coarse mesh size. Thus, one can
use larger time step size in an explicit approach. We present stability theory

analysis shows a drastic reduction of the DH type II events during Solar Cycle
24 which includes only 35% of the total events (i.e. 179 out of 514). Despite
having smaller number of DH type II events in the Solar Cycle 24, it contains a
significantly higher fraction of LFG events compared to the previous cycle (32%
$versus$ 24%). However, within the LFG group the cycle 23 exhibits significant
dominance of type II bursts that extend below 50 kHz, suggesting rich
population of powerful CMEs travelling beyond half of the Sun-Earth distance.
The events of LFG group display strongest association with faster and wider
(more than 82% events are halo) CMEs while at the source location they
predominantly trigger large M/X class flares (in more than 83% cases). Our
analysis also indicates that CME initial speed or flare energetics are partly
related with the duration of type II burst and that survival of CME associated
shock is determined by multiple factors/parameters related to CMEs, flares, and
state of coronal and interplanetary medium. The profiles relating CME heights
with respect to the end frequencies of DH type II bursts suggest that for HFG
and MFG categories, the location for majority of CMEs ($\approx$65%-70%) is in
well compliance with ten-fold Leblanc coronal density model, while for LFG
events a lower value of density multiplier ($\approx$3) seems to be compatible.

applied to solve this problem, most machine learning-based approaches assume
that the training and test data follow the same distribution, which is not
always true in real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce
SHIFT15M, a dataset that can be used to evaluate set-to-set matching models
when the distribution of data changes between training and testing. We conduct
benchmark experiments that demonstrate the performance drop of naive methods
due to distribution shift. Additionally, we provide software to handle the
SHIFT15M dataset in a simple manner, with the URL for the software to be made
available after publication of this manuscript. We believe proposed SHIFT15M
dataset provide a valuable resource for evaluating set-to-set matching models
under the distribution shift.

regarded as the first excited state of $^1S_{0}$ charmed-strange meson. Its
mass is, however, lower than the Godfrey-Isgur quark model prediction by about
80 MeV. In this work, we take into account the $D^{\ast}K$ contribution to the
bare $c\bar{s}$ state, and show that the coupled-channel interaction induces an
88 MeV shift with respect to the conventional quark model $c\bar{s}$ state,
which is much closer to the experimental mass. Our study shows that in addition
to $S$-wave, $P$-wave coupled-channel interactions also play a role for hadrons
located close to two-hadron thresholds. We further scrutinize the unquenched
quark model results with a model independent approach. It is shown that the
two-body $D^*K$ decay width is proportional to the weight of the $D^*K$
component. To saturate the experimental total decay width with the $D^*K$
partial decay width we need a weight of about 60\% while to reproduce the
unquenched quark model result a weight of about 5\% is needed. Therefore, we
encourage future experimental studies on the two-body $D^*K$ partial decay of
$D_{s0}(2590)$.

approximation of Koopman operators results in a class of linear predictors,
useful for formulating linear model predictive control (MPC) of nonlinear
dynamical systems with reduced computational complexity. However, the
robustness of the closed-loop Koopman MPC under modeling approximation errors
and possible exogenous disturbances is still a crucial issue to be resolved.
Aiming at the above problem, this paper presents a robust tube-based MPC
solution with Koopman operators, i.e., r-KMPC, for nonlinear discrete-time
dynamical systems with additive disturbances. The proposed controller is
composed of a nominal MPC using a lifted Koopman model and an off-line
nonlinear feedback policy. The proposed approach does not assume the
convergence of the approximated Koopman operator, which allows using a Koopman
model with a limited order for controller design. Fundamental properties, e.g.,
stabilizability, observability, of the Koopman model are derived under standard
assumptions with which, the closed-loop robustness and nominal point-wise
convergence are proven. Simulated examples are illustrated to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stab2488",,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We study the density structures of planetary nebulae implied by four

$\lambda5518/\lambda5538$, and [Ar IV] $\lambda4711/\lambda4740$. We use a

different atomic data have on the results. We compare the observational results
with those obtained from photoionization models characterized by three
different density structures. We conclude that the atomic data used in the
calculations of electron density fully determine the density structures that
are derived for the objects. We illustrate this by selecting three combinations
of atomic data that lead to observational results that are compatible with each

random tree in dimension $d$ ($d$-NN tree for short) defined as follows. Fix
the flat torus $\mathbb T^d_n$ of dimension $d$ and area $n$, equipped with the
metric inherited from the Euclidean metric of $\mathbb R^d$. Then, embed
consecutively $n$ vertices in $\mathbb T^d_n$ uniformly at random and let each
vertex but the first one connect to its (already embedded) nearest neighbor.
Call the resulting graph $G_n$. We show that asymptotically almost surely
(a.a.s.) the number of vertices of degree at least $k\in \mathbb N$ in the
$d$-NN tree decreases exponentially with $k$, and we obtain en passant that the
maximum degree of $G_n$ is of order $\Theta_d(\log n)$ a.a.s. Moreover, the
number of copies of any finite tree in the $d$-NN tree is shown to be a.a.s.
$\Theta_d(n)$, and all aforementioned counts are, by a general concentration
lemma that we show, tightly concentrated around their expectations. We also
give explicit bounds for the number of leaves that are independent of the
dimension. Next, we show that a.a.s. the height of a uniformly chosen vertex in
$\mathbb T^d_n$ is $(1+o(1))\log n$ independently of the dimension, and the
diameter of $\mathbb T^d_n$ is a.a.s. $(2e+o(1))\log n$, again, independently
of the dimension. Finally, we define a natural infinite version of a $d$-NN
tree $G_{\infty}$ via a Poisson Point Process in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where the
vertices are equipped with uniform arrival times in $[0,1]$ - and show that it
corresponds to the local limit of the sequence of finite graphs $(G_n)_{n \ge

simple random walk on $G_{\infty}$ is a.s. recurrent, and that a.s.

an alternative self-attention architecture, Shatter, that more efficiently

  Systems","3 figures, submitted to Asilomar 2021",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) are emerging as promising enablers for
the next generation of wireless communication systems, because of their ability
to customize favorable radio propagation environments. However, with the
conventional passive architecture, IRSs can only adjust the phase of the
incident signals limiting the achievable beamforming gain. To fully unleash the
potential of IRSs, in this paper, we consider a more general IRS architecture,
i.e., active IRSs, which can adapt the phase and amplify the magnitude of the
reflected incident signal simultaneously with the support of an additional
power source. To realize green communication in active IRS-assisted multiuser
systems, we jointly optimize the reflection matrix at the IRS and the
beamforming vector at the base station (BS) for the minimization of the BS
transmit power. The resource allocation algorithm design is formulated as an
optimization problem taking into account the maximum power budget of the active
IRS and the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of the users. To handle the
non-convex design problem, we develop a novel and computationally efficient
algorithm based on the bilinear transformation and inner approximation methods.
The proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a locally optimal solution
of the considered problem. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of
the proposed scheme compared to the two baseline schemes. Moreover, the results
unveil that deploying active IRSs is a promising approach to enhance the system
performance compared to conventional passive IRSs, especially when strong
direct links exist.

quantifies the best possible accuracy any classifier can achieve on a fixed

lower and upper bounds for the BER, these were usually compared only on
synthetic datasets with known probability distributions, leaving two key
questions unanswered: (1) How well do they perform on real-world datasets?, and
(2) How practical are they? Answering these is not trivial. Apart from the
obvious challenge of an unknown BER for real-world datasets, there are two main
aspects any BER estimator needs to overcome in order to be applicable in
real-world settings: (1) the computational and sample complexity, and (2) the
sensitivity and selection of hyper-parameters. In this work, we propose FeeBee,
the first principled framework for analyzing and comparing BER estimators on
any modern real-world dataset with unknown probability distribution. We achieve
this by injecting a controlled amount of label noise and performing multiple
evaluations on a series of different noise levels, supported by a theoretical
result which allows drawing conclusions about the evolution of the BER. By
implementing and analyzing 7 multi-class BER estimators on 6 commonly used
datasets of the computer vision and NLP domains, FeeBee allows a thorough study
of these estimators, clearly identifying strengths and weaknesses of each,
whilst being easily deployable on any future BER estimator.

nonstandard interactions, a homogeneous and isotropic gas of Majorana neutrinos
placed in a strong magnetic field can exhibit an angular flavor instability
mixing the two neutrino helicities (i.e., a `neutrino-antineutrino'
instability). This instability is most pronounced for the inverted mass
hierarchy and high neutrino number densities; at the same time, even a tiny
transition magnetic moment of the order of $10^{-24}\mu_{\text{B}}$ is quite
sufficient to trigger it. We study the properties of the neutrino-antineutrino
mode using the linear stability analysis and then perform a numerical
simulation to analyze the late-time properties of an oscillating neutrino gas
with V-A and (pseudo)scalar interactions. The latter analysis reveals three
phases of a chaotic, `thermalized' late-time state of neutrinos: along with a
low-density phase with the SO(3) symmetry broken by V-A interactions and a
symmetric high-density phase, another, (pseudo)scalar-induced phase with a
broken rotational symmetry appears. The phases can be distinguished by the
average late-time probabilities of (anti)neutrino flavors and/or by the
neutrino-to-antineutrino ratio, the latter being a key quantity for the
(pseudo)scalar phase. We thus show that observations of these quantities from a
supernova could place new constraints on the (pseudo)scalar nonstandard
neutrino interactions.

on-board computation. However, most of the current researches focuses on
simplified intersections considering only the surrounding vehicles and
idealized traffic lights. This paper improves the integrated decision and
control framework and develops a learning-based algorithm to deal with complex
intersections with mixed traffic flows, which can not only take account of
realistic characteristics of traffic lights, but also learn a safe policy under
different safety constraints. We first consider different velocity models for
green and red lights in the training process and use a finite state machine to
handle different modes of light transformation. Then we design different types
of distance constraints for vehicles, traffic lights, pedestrians, bicycles
respectively and formulize the constrained optimal control problems (OCPs) to
be optimized. Finally, reinforcement learning (RL) with value and policy
networks is adopted to solve the series of OCPs. In order to verify the safety

the existence of large-scale mixed traffic participants and set practical
traffic light phases. The simulation results indicate that the trained decision

aim, in this paper we first show that the steady-state transfer function of a

explicit model identification. Then, we leverage the estimated transfer
function to design a controller -- which is inspired by stochastic gradient

optimization problem. A distinguishing feature of our methods is that they do
not require any knowledge of the system dynamics, disturbance terms, or their

behavioral system theory, stochastic optimization with decision-dependent

the observing strategy in order to compensate for various time losses. There
are a number of updates in the image processing pipeline. Of particular
importance is the change in the sky subtraction algorithm; we subtract the sky
on small scales before the detection and measurement stages, which has
significantly reduced false detections. Thanks to this and other updates, the
overall quality of the processed data has improved since the previous release.
However, there are limitations in the data (for example, the pipeline is not

However, the robustness of natural language understanding (NLU) systems to
errors introduced by automatic speech recognition (ASR) is under-examined. %To
facilitate the research on ASR-robust general language understanding, In this
paper, we propose ASR-GLUE benchmark, a new collection of 6 different NLU tasks
for evaluating the performance of models under ASR error across 3 different
levels of background noise and 6 speakers with various voice characteristics.
Based on the proposed benchmark, we systematically investigate the effect of
ASR error on NLU tasks in terms of noise intensity, error type and speaker
variants. We further purpose two ways, correction-based method and data
augmentation-based method to improve robustness of the NLU systems. Extensive
experimental results and analysises show that the proposed methods are
effective to some extent, but still far from human performance, demonstrating
that NLU under ASR error is still very challenging and requires further
research.

practical attack scenario that the attacker injects malicious nodes rather than
modifying original nodes or edges to affect the performance of GNNs. However,
existing node injection attacks ignore extremely limited scenarios, namely the
injected nodes might be excessive such that they may be perceptible to the
target GNN. In this paper, we focus on an extremely limited scenario of single
node injection evasion attack, i.e., the attacker is only allowed to inject one
single node during the test phase to hurt GNN's performance. The discreteness
of network structure and the coupling effect between network structure and node
features bring great challenges to this extremely limited scenario. We first
propose an optimization-based method to explore the performance upper bound of
single node injection evasion attack. Experimental results show that 100%,
98.60%, and 94.98% nodes on three public datasets are successfully attacked
even when only injecting one node with one edge, confirming the feasibility of
single node injection evasion attack. However, such an optimization-based
method needs to be re-optimized for each attack, which is computationally
unbearable. To solve the dilemma, we further propose a Generalizable Node
Injection Attack model, namely G-NIA, to improve the attack efficiency while
ensuring the attack performance. Experiments are conducted across three
well-known GNNs. Our proposed G-NIA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines and is 500 times faster than the optimization-based method when
inferring.

optimization problems. In this work we modify QAOA to apply to finding ground

approximations to construct suitable QAOA operators and initial state. We find
robust qualitative behavior for QAOA as a function of the number of steps and

truth. Occlusion and scene dynamics in real-world scenes still adversely affect
the learning, despite significant progress made recently. In this paper, we
show that deliberately manipulating photometric errors can efficiently deal
with these difficulties better. We first propose an outlier masking technique
that considers the occluded or dynamic pixels as statistical outliers in the
photometric error map. With the outlier masking, the network learns the depth
of objects that move in the opposite direction to the camera more accurately.
To the best of our knowledge, such cases have not been seriously considered in
the previous works, even though they pose a high risk in applications like
autonomous driving. We also propose an efficient weighted multi-scale scheme to
reduce the artifacts in the predicted depth maps. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI dataset and additional experiments on the Cityscapes dataset have
verified the proposed approach's effectiveness on depth or ego-motion
estimation. Furthermore, for the first time, we evaluate the predicted depth on
the regions of dynamic objects and static background separately for both

effectiveness of our proposed technical approach and provides some interesting

virtual Datathon based on deidentified governmental data. Organized by a
multidisciplinary committee, Israel's research community was invited to offer
insights to COVID-19 policy challenges. The Datathon was designed to (1)
develop operationalizable data-driven models to address COVID-19 health-policy
challenges and (2) build a community of researchers from academia, industry,
and government and rebuild their trust in the government. Three specific
challenges were defined based on their relevance (significance, data
availability, and potential to anonymize the data): immunization policies,
special needs of the young population, and populations whose rate of compliance
with COVID-19 testing is low. The MoH team extracted diverse, reliable,
up-to-date, and deidentified governmental datasets for each challenge. Secure
remote-access research environments with relevant data science tools were set
on Amazon Web. The MoH screened the applicants and accepted around 80
participants, teaming them to balance areas of expertise as well as represent
all sectors of the community. One week following the event, anonymous surveys
for participants and mentors were distributed to assess overall usefulness and
points for improvement. The 48-hour Datathon and pre-event sessions included 18
multidisciplinary teams, mentored by 20 data scientists, 6 epidemiologists, 5
presentation mentors, and 12 judges. The insights developed by the 3 winning
teams are currently considered by the MoH as potential data science methods
relevant for national policies. The most positive results were increased trust
in the MoH and greater readiness to work with the government on these or future
projects. Detailed feedback offered concrete lessons for improving the
structure and organization of future government-led datathons.

essays are a genre of scientific writing that combine live, executable computer
code with narrative text to present a computational model or analysis. The
study took place across two contrasting university contexts: an
interdisciplinary data science and modeling course at Michigan State
University, USA, and a third-semester physics course at the University of Oslo,
Norway. Over the course of a semester, computational essays were simultaneously
and independently used in both courses, and comparable datasets of student
artifacts and retrospective interviews were collected from both student
populations. These data were analyzed using a framework which operationalized
the construct of epistemic agency across the dimensions of programming,
inquiry, data analysis and modeling, and communication. Based on this analysis,
we argue that computational essays can be a useful tool in redistributing
epistemic agency to students within higher education science due to their
combination of adaptability and disciplinary authenticity. However, we also
argue that educational contexts, scaffolding, expectations, and student
backgrounds can constrain and influence the ways in which students choose to

correlated materials. In most iron-based superconductors, the nematic
anisotropy is oriented in the Fe-Fe direction of the iron square lattice.
Recently, a novel type of nematicity along the diagonal Fe-As direction has
been suggested in heavily hole-doped $A$Fe$_2$As$_2$ ($A=$ Rb or Cs). However,
the transport studies focusing on the fluctuations of such nematicity have
provided controversial results regarding the presence of diagonal nematic
order. Here we report high-resolution heat capacity measurements under in-plane
field rotation in RbFe$_2$As$_2$. While the temperature dependence of specific
heat shows no discernible anomaly associated with the nematic transition, the
field-angle dependence of specific heat near the superconducting transition (at
$\sim 2.8$ K) reveals clear two-fold oscillations within the plane, providing
thermodynamic evidence for the diagonal nematicity. Moreover, we find that
M\""ossbauer spectroscopy sensitively probes the nematic transition at $\sim 50$
K with no evidence of static magnetism. These results imply that the diagonal
nematicity in RbFe$_2$As$_2$ has a unique mechanism involving charge degrees of
freedom, having unusual thermodynamic properties of the transition.

function of the Galactic longitudes. Based on the median $V_{\rm LSR}$ and two

study the effects of adversarial training on the neural policy learned by the

the outcomes of adversarial training on deep neural policies based on
worst-case distributional shift and feature sensitivity. For the first
approach, we compare the Fourier spectrum of minimal perturbations computed for
both adversarially trained and vanilla trained neural policies. Via experiments
in the OpenAI Atari environments we show that minimal perturbations computed
for adversarially trained policies are more focused on lower frequencies in the

measure the feature sensitivities of deep neural policies and we compare these

neural policies and vanilla trained deep neural policies. We believe our
results can be an initial step towards understanding the relationship between
adversarial training and different notions of robustness for neural policies.

potential imbalance, we suddenly switch on the tunnel-coupling and analyze the
post-quench equilibration in terms of particle number and energy imbalances. We
find that, in certain parameter regimes, the net energy can flow from the
colder quasicondensate to the hotter one and is governed by the surplus of low
energy particles flowing from the cold to the hot system relative to the
high-energy particles flowing in the reverse direction. In all cases, the
approach to the new thermal equilibrium occurs through transient, damped
oscillations. We also find that for a balanced initial state the coupled
quasicondensates can relax into a final thermal equilibrium state in which they
display a thermal phase coherence length that is larger than their initial
phase coherence length, even though the new equilibrium temperature is higher.
The increase in the phase coherence length occurs due to phase locking which
manifests itself via an increased degree of correlation between the local
relative phases of the quasicondensates at two arbitrary points.

ability to transform inputs across multiple layers to build good high-level
representations. It is therefore critical to understand this process of
representation learning. However, standard theoretical approaches (formally
NNGPs) involving infinite width limits eliminate representation learning. We
therefore develop a new infinite width limit, the Bayesian representation
learning limit, that exhibits representation learning mirroring that in
finite-width models, yet at the same time, retains some of the simplicity of
standard infinite-width limits. In particular, we show that Deep Gaussian
processes (DGPs) in the Bayesian representation learning limit have exactly
multivariate Gaussian posteriors, and the posterior covariances can be obtained
by optimizing an interpretable objective combining a log-likelihood to improve
performance with a series of KL-divergences which keep the posteriors close to
the prior. We confirm these results experimentally in wide but finite DGPs.
Next, we introduce the possibility of using this limit and objective as a
flexible, deep generalisation of kernel methods, that we call deep kernel
machines (DKMs). Like most naive kernel methods, DKMs scale cubically in the
number of datapoints. We therefore use methods from the Gaussian process
inducing point literature to develop a sparse DKM that scales linearly in the
number of datapoints. Finally, we extend these approaches to NNs (which have
non-Gaussian posteriors) in the Appendices.

seen fine-grained objects in the query set, given only a few samples of this
class in the support set. Previous works focus on learning discriminative image
features from a limited number of training samples for distinguishing various
fine-grained classes, but ignore one important fact that spatial alignment of
the discriminative semantic features between the query image with arbitrary
changes and the support image, is also critical for computing the semantic
similarity between each support-query pair. In this work, we propose an
object-aware long-short-range spatial alignment approach, which is composed of
a foreground object feature enhancement (FOE) module, a long-range semantic
correspondence (LSC) module and a short-range spatial manipulation (SSM)
module. The FOE is developed to weaken background disturbance and encourage
higher foreground object response. To address the problem of long-range object
feature misalignment between support-query image pairs, the LSC is proposed to
learn the transferable long-range semantic correspondence by a designed feature
similarity metric. Further, the SSM module is developed to refine the
transformed support feature after the long-range step to align short-range
misaligned features (or local details) with the query features. Extensive
experiments have been conducted on four benchmark datasets, and the results
show superior performance over most state-of-the-art methods under both 1-shot

utilization of signal samples captured from a known set of unauthorized

Since acquiring new transmitters to use as known transmitters is highly
expensive, we propose to use generative deep learning methods to emulate
unauthorized signal samples for the augmentation of training datasets. We
develop two different data augmentation techniques, one that exploits a limited
number of known unauthorized transmitters and the other that does not require
any unauthorized transmitters. Experiments conducted on a dataset captured from

  We aim to investigate if the merger histories and environments are
significantly different between AGN and non-AGN dwarf galaxies in cosmological
simulations, which may be indicative of the importance of these for AGN
activity in dwarf galaxies, and whether these results are in line with
observations.
  Using the IllustrisTNG flagship TNG100-1 run, 6\,771 dwarf galaxies are found
with 3\,863 ($\sim$57 per cent) having some level of AGN activity. In order to
quantify `environment', two measures are used: 1) the distance to a galaxy's
10th nearest neighbour at 6 redshifts and 2) the time since last merger for
three different minimum merger mass ratios. A similar analysis is run on
TNG50-1 and Illustris-1 to test for the robustness of the findings.
  Both measures yield significantly different distributions between AGN and
non-AGN galaxies; more non-AGN than AGN galaxies have long term residence in
dense environments while recent ($\leq 4 \text{ Gyr}$) minor mergers are more
common for intermediate AGN activity. While no statements are made about the
micro- or macrophysics from these results, it is nevertheless indicative of a

detector from its original source domain with rich labeled data to a new target
domain with unlabeled data. Previous works focus on improving the domain
adaptability of region-based detectors, e.g., Faster-RCNN, through matching
cross-domain instance-level features that are explicitly extracted from a
region proposal network (RPN). However, this is unsuitable for region-free
detectors such as single shot detector (SSD), which perform a dense prediction
from all possible locations in an image and do not have the RPN to encode such
instance-level features. As a result, they fail to align important image
regions and crucial instance-level features between the domains of region-free
detectors. In this work, we propose an adversarial module to strengthen the
cross-domain matching of instance-level features for region-free detectors.
Firstly, to emphasize the important regions of image, the DSEM learns to
predict a transferable foreground enhancement mask that can be utilized to
suppress the background disturbance in an image. Secondly, considering that
region-free detectors recognize objects of different scales using multi-scale
feature maps, the DSEM encodes both multi-level semantic representations and
multi-instance spatial-contextual relationships across different domains.
Finally, the DSEM is pluggable into different region-free detectors, ultimately
achieving the densely semantic feature matching via adversarial learning.
Extensive experiments have been conducted on PASCAL VOC, Clipart, Comic,
Watercolor, and FoggyCityscape benchmarks, and their results well demonstrate
that the proposed approach not only improves the domain adaptability of
region-free detectors but also outperforms existing domain adaptive
region-based detectors under various domain shift settings.

expressions under the language semantics, Milner (1984) formulated a sound
proof system for bisimilarity of regular expressions under the process
interpretation he introduced. He asked whether this system is complete.
Proof-theoretic arguments attempting to show completeness of this equational
system are complicated by the presence of a non-algebraic rule for solving
fixed-point equations by using star iteration.
  We characterize the derivational power that the fixed-point rule adds to the
purely equational part $\text{Mil$^{\boldsymbol{-}}$}$ of Milner's system
$\text{$\text{Mil}$}$: it corresponds to the power of coinductive proofs over
$\text{Mil$^{\boldsymbol{-}}$}$ that have the form of finite process graphs
with the loop existence and elimination property $\text{LEE}$. We define a
variant system $\text{cMil}$ by replacing the fixed-point rule in $\text{Mil}$
with a rule that permits $\text{LEE}$-shaped circular derivations in
$\text{Mil$^{\boldsymbol{-}}$}$ from previously derived equations as a premise.
With this rule alone we also define the variant system $\text{CLC}$ for merely
combining $\text{LEE}$-shaped coinductive proofs over
$\text{Mil$^{\boldsymbol{-}}$}$. We show that both $\text{cMil}$ and
$\text{CLC}$ have proof interpretations in $\text{Mil}$, and vice versa. As
this correspondence links, in both directions, derivability in $\text{Mil}$
with derivation trees of process graphs, it widens the space for graph-based
approaches to finding a completeness proof of Milner's system.

fast deployment of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) in subterranean
Search-and-Rescue (SAR) missions. A COMPRA-enabled MAV is able to autonomously
explore previously unknown areas while specific mission criteria are considered
e.g. an object of interest is identified and localized, the remaining useful
battery life, the overall desired exploration mission duration. The proposed
architecture follows a low-complexity algorithmic design to facilitate fully
on-board computations, including nonlinear control, state-estimation,
navigation, exploration behavior and object localization capabilities. The
framework is mainly structured around a reactive local avoidance planner, based
on enhanced Potential Field concepts and using instantaneous 3D pointclouds, as
well as a computationally efficient heading regulation technique, based on
depth images from an instantaneous camera stream. Those techniques decouple the
collision-free path generation from the dependency of a global map and are
capable of handling imprecise localization occasions. Field experimental
verification of the overall architecture is performed in relevant unknown
Global Positioning System (GPS)-denied environments.

factor $d_\tau(s)$ in $\tau$ pair production by $e^+ e^-$ collisions at BEPC-II
collider energies.
  We compute the expectation values and covariances of simple and optimal
$CP$-odd observables for $\tau$-pair production at $\sqrt{s}=4.18$ GeV and
$4.95$ GeV with subsequent decays of $\tau^\pm$ into major leptonic or
semihadronic modes. For the $\tau$ decays to two pions and three charged pions
we take the full kinematic information of the hadronic system into account.
  Applying cuts and using realistic assumptions on the eventually attainable
integrated luminosities at these energies, ${\cal L}(4.18) = 3\times 10^4~{\rm
pb}^{-1}$ and ${\cal L}(4.95) = 10^4~{\rm pb}^{-1}$, respectively, we find the
following.
  By taking into account purely semihadronic and semihadronic-leptonic
$\tau^+\tau^-$ decays one can achieve with optimal $CP$-odd observables the 1
s.d. sensitivities $\delta {\rm Re} d_\tau = 4.5\times 10^{-18}$ ecm
($5.3\times 10^{-18}$ ecm) and $\delta {\rm Im} d_\tau = 2.2 \times 10^{-18}$

  methodological review on biomedical applications",,,,,"physics.med-ph eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Significance: Speckle has historically been considered a source of noise in
coherent light imaging. However, a number of works in optical coherence
tomography (OCT) imaging have shown that speckle patterns may contain relevant
information regarding sub-resolution and structural properties of the tissues
from which it is originated.
  Aim: The objective of this work is to provide a comprehensive overview of the
methods developed for retrieving speckle information in biomedical OCT
applications.
  Approach: PubMed and Scopus databases were used to perform a systematic
review on studies published until April 2021. From 134-screened studies, 37
were eligible for this review.
  Results: The studies have been clustered according to the nature of their
analysis, namely static or dynamic, and all features were described and
analysed. The results show that features retrieved from speckle can be used
successfully in different applications, such as classification and
segmentation. However, the results also show that speckle analysis is highly
application-dependant, and the best approach varies between applications.
  Conclusions: Several of the reviewed analysis were only performed in a
theoretical context or using phantoms, showing that signal-carrying speckle
analysis in OCT imaging is still in its early stage, and further work is needed
to validate its applicability and reproducibility in a clinical context.

$-7.5$^{\circ}$, using the Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO) 13.7 m millimeter
telescope. Adopting a distance of 470 pc, the mass of the observed molecular
cloud estimated from $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O is about
2.59$\times$10$^{4}$ M$_\odot$, 0.85$\times$10$^{4}$ M$_\odot$, and
0.09$\times$10$^{4}$ M$_\odot$, respectively. A large-scale continuous filament
extending about 72 pc is revealed from the $^{13}$CO images. A systematic
velocity gradient perpendicular to the major axis appears and is measured to be
$\sim$ 0.82 km s$^{-1}$ pc$^{-1}$. The kinematics along the filament shows an
oscillation pattern with a fragmentation wavelength of $\sim$ 2.3 pc and
velocity amplitude of $\sim$ 0.92 km s$^{-1}$, which may be related with
core-forming flows. Furthermore, assuming an inclination angle to the plane of
the sky of 45$^{\circ}$, the estimated average accretion rate is $\sim$ 101
M$_\odot$ Myr$^{-1}$ for the cluster LkH$\alpha$ 101 and $\sim$ 21 M$_\odot$
Myr$^{-1}$ for the other regions. In the C$^{18}$O observations, the
large-scale filament could be resolved into multiple substructures and their
dynamics are consistent with the scenario of filament formation from converging
flows. Approximately 225 C$^{18}$O cores are extracted, of which 181 are
starless cores. Roughly 37$\%$ (67/181) of the starless cores have
$\alpha_{\text{vir}}$ less than 1. Twenty outflow candidates are identified
along the filament. Our results indicate active early-phase star formation
along the large-scale filament in the CMC region.

and analysis of complex systems arising in many scientific disciplines (e.g.
feature-oriented systems, gene regulatory networks, etc.). One of the
fundamental problems for edge-coloured graphs is the detection of strongly
connected components, or SCCs. The size of edge-coloured graphs appearing in
practice can be enormous both in the number of vertices and colours. The large
number of vertices prevents us from analysing such graphs using explicit SCC
detection algorithms, such as Tarjan's, which motivates the use of a symbolic
approach. However, the large number of colours also renders existing symbolic
SCC detection algorithms impractical. This paper proposes a novel algorithm
that symbolically computes all the monochromatic strongly connected components
of an edge-coloured graph. In the worst case, the algorithm performs $O(p \cdot
n \cdot log~n)$ symbolic steps, where $p$ is the number of colours and $n$ is
the number of vertices. We evaluate the algorithm using an experimental
implementation based on binary decision diagrams (BDDs). Specifically, we use
our implementation to explore the SCCs of a large collection of coloured graphs
(up to $2^{48}$) obtained from Boolean networks -- a modelling framework
commonly appearing in systems biology.

of cell images with low quality. It is difficult to capture cells with strong
light. Therefore, the microscopic images of cells tend to have low image
quality but these images are not good for semantic segmentation. Here we
propose a method to translate an input image to the images that are easy to
recognize by deep learning. The proposed method consists of two deep neural
networks. The first network is the usual training for semantic segmentation,
and penultimate feature maps of the first network are used as filters to
translate an input image to the images that emphasize each class. This is the
automatic preprocessing and translated cell images are easily classified. The
input cell image with low quality is translated by the feature maps in the
first network, and the translated images are fed into the second network for
semantic segmentation. Since the outputs of the second network are multiple
segmentation results, we conduct the weighted ensemble of those segmentation
images. Two networks are trained by end-to-end manner, and we do not need to
prepare images with high quality for the translation. We confirmed that our
proposed method can translate cell images with low quality to the images that
are easy to segment, and segmentation accuracy has improved using the weighted
ensemble learning.

between two parallel plates, with a specific focus on the signatures for the
onset of transient shear banding using the Johnson-Segalman, non-stretching
Rolie-Poly and Giesekus models. We explore the dynamics of shear start-up in
monotonic regions of the constitutive curves using two different methodologies:
(i) the oft-used `frozen-time' linear stability (eigenvalue) analysis, wherein
we examine whether infinitesimal perturbations imposed on instantaneous stress
components (treated as quasi steady states) exhibit exponential growth, and
(ii) the more mathematically rigorous fundamental-matrix approach that
characterizes the transient growth via a numerical solution of the
time-dependent linearized governing equations, wherein the linearized
perturbations co-evolve with the start-up shear flow. Our results reinforce the
hitherto understated point that there is no universal connection between the
overshoot and subsequent decay of shear stress in the base state and the
unstable eigenvalues obtained from the frozen-time stability analysis. It may
therefore be difficult to subsume the occurrence of transient shear banding
during shear start-up within the ambit of a single model-independent criterion.
Our work also suggests that the strong transients during shear start-up seen in
earlier work could well be a consequence of consideration of the limit of small
solvent viscosity in the absence of otherwise negligible terms such as fluid
inertia.

consisting of six diverse datasets spanning various domains (e.g., natural

multispectral). Using this benchmark, we re-evaluate the standard cross-entropy
baseline and eight methods for data-efficient deep learning published between
2017 and 2021 at renowned venues. For a fair and realistic comparison, we
carefully tune the hyper-parameters of all methods on each dataset.
Surprisingly, we find that tuning learning rate, weight decay, and batch size

outperforms all but one specialized method and performs competitively to the

co-deformation of both phases under external load are not yet fully understood.
We therefore used nano- and microindentation in combination with electron
microscopy to study the deformation behaviour of an Mg-3.68Al-3.8Ca alloy.
  We found that the hardness of the Mg$_2$Ca phase was significantly larger
than the $\alpha$-Mg phase and stays constant within the measured temperature
range. The strain rate sensitivity of the softer $\alpha$-Mg phase and of the
interfaces increased while activation volume decreased with temperature. The
creep deformation of the Mg$_2$Ca Laves phase was significantly lower than the
$\alpha$-Mg phase at 170 $^{\circ}$C. Moreover, the deformation zone around and
below microindents depends on the matrix orientation and is influenced by the
presence of Laves phases. Most importantly, slip transfer from the $\alpha$-Mg
phase to the (Mg,Al)$_2$Ca Laves phase occurred, carried by the basal planes.
Based on the observed orientation relationship and active slip systems, a slip
transfer mechanism from the soft $\alpha$-Mg phase to the hard Laves phase is
proposed. Further, we present implications for future alloy design strategies.

triplets, i.e., subject, predicate, object, in an image, providing a structural
vision layout for scene understanding. However, current models are stuck in
common predicates, e.g., ""on"" and ""at"", rather than informative ones, e.g.,
""standing on"" and ""looking at"", resulting in the loss of precise information
and overall performance. If a model only uses ""stone on road"" rather than
""blocking"" to describe an image, it is easy to misunderstand the scene. We
argue that this phenomenon is caused by two key imbalances between informative
predicates and common ones, i.e., semantic space level imbalance and training
sample level imbalance. To tackle this problem, we propose BA-SGG, a simple yet
effective SGG framework based on balance adjustment but not the conventional
distribution fitting. It integrates two components: Semantic Adjustment (SA)
and Balanced Predicate Learning (BPL), respectively for adjusting these
imbalances. Benefited from the model-agnostic process, our method is easily
applied to the state-of-the-art SGG models and significantly improves the SGG
performance. Our method achieves 14.3%, 8.0%, and 6.1% higher Mean Recall (mR)

efficient coupling of quantum entangled photon sources with narrow-linewidth
quantum memories we performed the frequency stabilization of two lasers at 1514

frequency stability of 3.6 \times 10^{-12} (\tau = 1 s). The 1010 nm pump laser
of the wavelength conversion system exhibited a frequency stability of 3.4

two orders of magnitude smaller than the frequency width of 4 MHz of the Pr:YSO

existing metrics either neglect the intrinsic cause of the factual

light of these challenges, we propose a novel metric to evaluate the factual

formulates the causal relationship among the source document, the generated

can cause factual inconsistency, from the total causal effect on the generated

without relying on other auxiliary tasks. We conduct a series of experiments on
three public abstractive text summarization datasets, and demonstrate the
advantages of the proposed metric in both improving the correlation with human

  Here, we propose the so-called Thermodynamics-based Artificial Neural

TANN manage to identify the internal state variables that characterize the
inelastic deformation of the complex microstructural fields. These internal
state variables are then used to reconstruct the microdeformation fields of the
microstructure at a given state. Finally, a double-scale homogenization scheme
(FEMxTANN) is used to solve a large scale boundary value problem. The high
performance of the homogenized model using TANN is illustrated through detailed
comparisons with microstructural calculations at large scale. An excellent
agreement is shown for a variety of monotonous and cyclic stress-strain paths.

containing the topic-level structure of the dialogue. We define tasks in CSDS
as generating the overall summary and different role-oriented summaries for a

analyzing the performance on role-oriented summaries and topic structures. We
hope that this study could benchmark Chinese dialogue summarization and benefit

video codec and format-compliant encryption schemes, we propose a new
compressed-domain feature to capture motion information in complex surveillance
scenarios. Based on this feature, we design an adaptive clustering algorithm
for moving object segmentation with an accuracy of 4x4 pixels. We then propose
a multiple object tracking scheme that uses Kalman filter estimation and
adaptive measurement refinement. The proposed scheme does not require video
decryption or full decompression and has a very low computation load. The
experimental results demonstrate that our scheme achieves the best detection
and tracking performance compared with existing works in the encrypted and

scenarios with different challenges, such as camera movement/jitter, dynamic

clusters, near the phase transition temperature $\left(T_{\rm ch} \approx 155
\, \rm{MeV} \right)$ has been a puzzling observation that seems to be at odds
with Big Bang nucleosynthesis suggesting that deuterons and other clusters are
formed only below a temperature $T\approx 0.1-1 \, \text{MeV}$. We solve this
puzzle by showing that the light cluster abundancies in heavy ion reactions
stay approximately constant from chemical freeze-out to kinetic freeze-out. To
this aim we develop an extensive network of coupled reaction rate equations
including stable hadrons and hadronic resonances to describe the temporal
evolution of the abundancies of light (anti-)(hyper-)nuclei in the late
hadronic environment of an ultrarelativistic heavy ion collision. It is
demonstrated that the chemical equilibration of the light nuclei occurs on a
very short timescale as a consequence of the strong production and dissociation
processes. However, because of the partial chemical equilibrium of the stable
hadrons, including the nucleon feeding from $\Delta$ resonances, the
abundancies of the light nuclei stay nearly constant during the evolution and
cooling of the hadronic phase. This solves the longstanding contradiction
between the thermal fits and the late stage coalescence (and the Big Bang
nucleosynthesis) and explains why the observed light cluster yields are
compatible with both a high chemical production temperature and a late state
emission as modelled by coalescence. We also note in passing that the
abundancies of the light clusters in the present approach are in excellent
agreement with those measured by ALICE at LHC.

architecture and a training pipeline to tackle the mentioned challenges. Our
architecture takes the best from the previous ones and brings the ability to be
successful not only in appearance-based action recognition tasks but in
motion-based problems too. Furthermore, the induced label noise problem is
formulated and Adaptive Clip Selection (ACS) framework is proposed to deal with
it. Together it makes the LIGAR framework the general-purpose action
recognition solution. We also have reported the extensive analysis on the
general and gesture datasets to show the excellent trade-off between the
performance and the accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art solutions.

principle behind this approach involves reformulating potential natural

differentially optimizing the prompt template as well as the target label with
backpropagation. Furthermore, the proposed approach can be: (i) Plugged to any

horizonless rotating boson star, a small body could pass through the center and
follow novel types of orbits. These will generate the gravitational waves that
can not be obtained in the scenario corresponding to an extreme-mass-ratio
inspiral with a central supermassive black hole. This can be used to examine
whether a supermassive rotating boson star is present at the centers of
galaxies. In this work, we consider an extreme-mass-ratio inspiral system
described by a small compact object inspiralling into a central supermassive
rotating boson star. Integrating four types of special equatorial geodesics and
using the numerical kludge method with quadrupole approximation, we obtain the
corresponding gravitational waveforms and find that there are high-frequency
gravitational radiation pulses in such system. The frequencies of the
gravitational radiation pulses could be in the magnitude of $10^{-1}$Hz and the
whole gravitational wave parts are in the milli-Hz. By assuming the masses of
the central supermassive rotating boson star and small compact object to be
$10^6 M_\odot$ and $10 M_\odot$ and assuming a distance of $1\text{Gpc}$, we

Field theoretical considerations are applied in order to construct a

Here, we point out the importance of introducing renormalized coupling
constants for coarse-grained densities. We show that the low-energy excitation
spectra for the two kindsof fields are related to each other by suitable
rescaling using the renormalized constants. By calculating the entanglement
entropy, we find that for an intercomponent repulsion (attraction), the two
components are more strongly entangled in the case of parallel (antiparallel)
fields, in qualitative agreement with recent studies for a quantum (spin) Hall
regime. We also find that the entanglement spectrum exhibits an anomalous
square-root dispersion relation, which leads to a subleading logarithmic term
in the entanglement entropy. All of these are confirmed by numerical
calculations based on the Bogoliubov theory with the lowest-Landau-level
approximation. Finally, we investigate the effects of quantum fluctuations on
the phase diagrams by calculating the correction to the ground-state energy due
to zero-point fluctuations in the Bogoliubov theory. We find that the

statistical closure problem is the lack of training data, which is a
configuration that is not desirable in supervised learning with neural network
models. In this study with the 40-dimensional Lorenz-96 model, the shortage of
data (in temporal) is due to the stationarity of the statistics beyond the
decorrelation time, thus, the only informative content in the training data is
on short-time transient statistics. We adopted a unified closure framework on
various truncation regimes, including and excluding the detailed dynamical
equations for the variances. The closure frameworks employ a
Long-Short-Term-Memory architecture to represent the higher-order unresolved
statistical feedbacks with careful consideration to account for the intrinsic
instability yet producing stable long-time predictions. We found that this
unified agnostic ML approach performs well under various truncation scenarios.
Numerically, the ML closure model can accurately predict the long-time
statistical responses subjected to various time-dependent external forces that
are not (and maximum forcing amplitudes that are relatively larger than those)

application of these theorems, we analyze the convergence of inner and outer

the the cavity detuning and driving field strength, the width of minimum energy

which allows us to speed up the evolution along the adiabatic path. Compared
with the previous proposal of preparing the cat state by only controlling
two-photon pumping strength in a Kerr nonlinear resonator, our method can
prepare the target state with much shorter time, as well as a high fidelity and
a large non-classical volume. It is worth noting that the cat state prepared by
our method is also robust against single-photon loss very well. Moreover, when
our proposal has a large initial detuning, it will creates a large-size cat
state successfully. This proposal of preparing cat states can be implemented in
superconducting quantum circuits, which provides a quantum state resource for
quantum information encoding and fault-tolerant quantum computing.

enable the reuse of already available iterative solvers and preconditioners, in
our case, from the DuMux framework. Our results indicate that the approaches
can yield performance and scalability improvements compared to using direct
solvers: Partitioned coupling is able to solve large problems faster if
iterative solvers with suitable preconditioners are applied for the
subproblems. The monolithic approach shows even stronger requirements on
preconditioning, as standard simple solvers fail to converge. Our monolithic
block preconditioning yields the fastest runtimes for large systems, but they
vary strongly with the preconditioner configuration. Interestingly, using a
specialized Uzawa preconditioner for the Stokes subsystem leads to overall
increased runtimes compared to block preconditioners utilizing a more general
algebraic multigrid. This highlights that optimizing for the non-coupled cases

humans and other mammals, and form ultra-large, spatial, structured graphs.
Their neuronal organization is closely interconnected with the spatial
organization of the brain's microvasculature, which supplies oxygen to the
neurons and builds a complementary spatial graph. This vasculature (or the
vessel structure) plays an important role in neuroscience; for example, the
organization of (and changes to) vessel structure can represent early signs of
various pathologies, e.g. Alzheimer's disease or stroke. Recently, advances in
tissue clearing have enabled whole brain imaging and segmentation of the
entirety of the mouse brain's vasculature. Building on these advances in
imaging, we are presenting an extendable dataset of whole-brain vessel graphs
based on specific imaging protocols. Specifically, we extract vascular graphs
using a refined graph extraction scheme leveraging the volume rendering engine
Voreen and provide them in an accessible and adaptable form through the OGB and
PyTorch Geometric dataloaders. Moreover, we benchmark numerous state-of-the-art
graph learning algorithms on the biologically relevant tasks of vessel
prediction and vessel classification using the introduced vessel graph dataset.
Our work paves a path towards advancing graph learning research into the field
of neuroscience. Complementarily, the presented dataset raises challenging
graph learning research questions for the machine learning community, in terms
of incorporating biological priors into learning algorithms, or in scaling
these algorithms to handle sparse,spatial graphs with millions of nodes and

serious problem to models based on these symmetries. A famous example is the
Peccei-Quinn solution to the strong CP problem in QCD axion models; it requires
a global U(1) symmetry to be respected with high quality, and even the
Planck-scale suppressed operators that violate the U(1) symmetry would spoil
this solution. Indeed, it is known that gravitational instantons do break the
U(1) Peccei-Quinn symmetry and induce the U(1)-violating operators, bringing
back the strong CP problem to the axion models. This conclusion is, however,
dependent highly on the structure of the theory around the Planck scale and,
therefore, may be evaded if we go beyond the minimal setup. In this paper, we
study the effect of a non-minimal coupling of the Peccei-Quinn field to
gravity, $\xi$, on the gravitational instanton effect. This setup is frequently
considered in cosmology as it can realize a successful inflation if $\xi

increasing the amount of nonlinearity, the system self-organizes into a
large-scale incoherent localized structure that contains ""hidden"" coherent
soliton states: The solitons can hardly be identified in the usual spatial or
spectral domains, while their existence is unveiled in the phase-space
representation (spectrogram). We develop a theoretical approach that provides
the coupled description of the coherent soliton component (governed by an
effective Schr\""odinger-Poisson equation) and of the incoherent component
(governed by a wave turbulence Vlasov-Poisson equation). The theory shows that
the incoherent structure introduces an effective trapping potential that
stabilizes the hidden coherent soliton, a mechanism that we verify by direct

incoherent structure, such as its compactly supported spectral shape. It also
clarifies the quantum-to-classical correspondence in the presence of

used to experimentally measure the thermal conductivity of the suspended and
the Si/SiO2 substrate supported monolayer WS2 at a temperature range of 200 K -
400 K. The room-temperature thermal conductivity of suspended and supported WS2
are 28.45 W/mK and 15.39 W/mK, respectively, with a ~50% reduction due to
substrate effect. To systematically study the underlying mechanism behind the
striking reduction, we employed the Raman spatial mapping analysis combined
with the molecular dynamics simulation. The analysis of Raman spectra showed
the increase of doping level, reduction of phonon lifetime and suppression of
out-of-plane vibration mode due to substrate effect. In addition, the phonon
transmission coefficient was mutually verified with Raman spectra analysis and
further revealed that the substrate effect significantly enhances the phonon
scattering at the interface and mainly suppresses the acoustic phonon, thus
leading to the reduction of thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity of
other suspended and supported monolayer TMDCs (e.g. MoS2, MoSe2 and WSe2) were
also listed for comparison. Our researches can be extended to understand the
substrate effect of other 2D TMDCs and provide guidance for future TMDCs-based
electrical and optoelectronic devices.

multiple equilibrium states, either conductive rather than convective, or
convective but with different ice front patterns. The shape of the ice front
appears to be always determined by the large scale circulation in the system.
In RB, the precise shape depends on the degree of lateral confinement. In the
VC case the ice front morphology is more robust, due to the presence of two
vertically stacked counter-rotating convective rolls for all the studied cell

express pain through their facial and body behavior, but may hide signs of pain
from unfamiliar human observers. In addition, collecting visual data with
detailed annotation of horse behavior and pain state is both cumbersome and not
scalable. Consequently, a pragmatic equine pain classification system would use
video of the unobserved horse and weak labels. This paper proposes such a
method for equine pain classification by using multi-view surveillance video
footage of unobserved horses with induced orthopaedic pain, with temporally
sparse video level pain labels. To ensure that pain is learned from horse body
language alone, we first train a self-supervised generative model to
disentangle horse pose from its appearance and background before using the
disentangled horse pose latent representation for pain classification. To make
best use of the pain labels, we develop a novel loss that formulates pain
classification as a multi-instance learning problem. Our method achieves pain
classification accuracy better than human expert performance with 60% accuracy.
The learned latent horse pose representation is shown to be viewpoint
covariant, and disentangled from horse appearance. Qualitative analysis of pain
classified segments shows correspondence between the pain symptoms identified
by our model, and equine pain scales used in veterinary practice.

applying a custom neural network classifier (NNC) tuned to select galaxies with

best third of the galaxy sample, the NNC achieves a 35% improvement in outlier
rate and a 23% improvement in $\sigma_z$ compared to using uncertainties from
TPZ. For cosmology and galaxy evolution studies, this method can be tuned to
retain a particular sample size or to achieve a desired photo-$z$ accuracy; our

with the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), the shift towards

focus mainly on road inundation exposure assessment based on flood maps. This
study addresses this limitation by using crowdsourced and fine-grained traffic
data as an indicator of road inundation, and topographic, hydrologic, and
temporal precipitation features as predictor variables. Two tree-based machine
learning models (random forest and AdaBoost) were then tested and trained for
predicting road inundations in the contexts of 2017 Hurricane Harvey and 2019
Tropical Storm Imelda in Harris County, Texas. The findings from Hurricane
Harvey indicate that precipitation is the most important feature for predicting
road inundation susceptibility, and that topographic features are more
essential than hydrologic features for predicting road inundations in both
storm cases. The random forest and AdaBoost models had relatively high AUC
scores (0.860 and 0.810 for Harvey respectively and 0.790 and 0.720 for Imelda

significantly for Imelda. This study advances the emerging field of smart flood
resilience in terms of predictive flood risk mapping at the road level. For
example, such models could help impacted communities and emergency management
agencies develop better preparedness and response strategies with improved
situational awareness of road inundation likelihood as an extreme weather event

However, their capabilities are limited to the knowledge of the designer and
consequently lack generalizability to initially unconsidered situations. This
makes deep reinforcement learning (DRL) especially interesting, as these
algorithms promise a self-learning system only relying on feedback from the
environment. In this paper, we consider the problem of lidar-based robot
navigation in continuous action space using DRL without providing any
goal-oriented or global information. By relying solely on local sensor data to
solve navigation tasks, we design an agent that assigns its own waypoints based
on intrinsic motivation. Our agent is able to learn goal-directed navigation
behavior even when facing only sparse feedback, i.e., delayed rewards when
reaching the target. To address this challenge and the complexity of the
continuous action space, we deploy a hierarchical agent structure in which the
exploration is distributed across multiple layers. Within the hierarchical
structure, our agent self-assigns internal goals and learns to extract
reasonable waypoints to reach the desired target position only based on local
sensor data. In our experiments, we demonstrate the navigation capabilities of
our agent in two environments and show that the hierarchical structure
seriously improves the performance in terms of success rate and success
weighted by path length in comparison to a flat structure. Furthermore, we
provide a real-robot experiment to illustrate that the trained agent can be

negative, unintended consequences, such as biasing readers' interpretations, a
loss of trust as a result of too much transparency, and the possibility of
opening visualization creators with minoritized identities up to undeserved
critique. To help future visualization researchers and practitioners decide
what kinds of metadata to include, we discuss some of the potential benefits
and risks of disclosing five kinds of metadata: metadata about the source of
the underlying data; the cleaning and processing conducted; the marks,
channels, and other design elements used; the people who directly created the
visualization; and the people for whom the visualization was created. We
conclude by proposing a few open research questions related to how to

dispatch problem (EDP) and load shedding. For the EDP, an extension of the
problem considering the transmission losses is presented. Because the
optimization problem is non-convex owing to quadratic equality constraints
modeling the transmission losses, a convex relaxation method is presented.
Under a particular assumption, it is shown that a distributed algorithm can be
designed to solve the considered EDP. Furthermore, this work aims to handle an
overloading problem by employing an optimal load shedding method. Emphasis is
placed on scheduling the load shedding when there exist some priorities on the
loads. First, a novel optimization problem is proposed to obtain the load
shedding according to the predefined priority order. Then, a distributed
algorithm solving the optimization problem is presented. Finally, this paper
presents how to integrate the proposed algorithms, i.e., the EDP and the load
shedding, in a distributed manner. Simulation results are presented to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

acoustic phonons that are transmitted through an intercalated crystal. By
tuning the ferromagnetic resonances of the two magnets to an acoustic resonance
of the crystal, we control a coherent three levels system. We show that the

out-of-phase / in-phase lattice displacements at the magnets, leading to bright

The sample is a tri-layer garnet consisting of two thin magnetic layers
epitaxially grown on both sides of a half-millimeter thick non-magnetic single

this long range strong coupling. This demonstrates that garnets are a great
platform to study multi-partite hybridization process between magnon and

non-gravitational interactions with ordinary matter, we propose an experiment
using a \pbo ~calorimeter to search for or set new limits on the production
rate of i) hidden sector particles in the $3 - 60$ MeV mass range via their
$e^+e^-$ decay (or $\gamma\gamma$ decay with limited tracking), and ii) the
hypothetical X17 particle, claimed in multiple recent experiments. The search
for these particles is motivated by new hidden sector models and dark matter
candidates introduced to account for a variety of experimental and
observational puzzles: the small-scale structure puzzle in cosmological
simulations, anomalies such as the 4.2$\sigma$ disagreement between experiments
and the standard model prediction for the muon anomalous magnetic moment, and
the excess of $e^+e^-$ pairs from the $^8$Be M1 and $^4$He nuclear transitions
to their ground states observed by the ATOMKI group. In these models, the $1 -
100$ MeV mass range is particularly well-motivated and the lower part of this
range still remains unexplored. Our proposed direct detection experiment will
use a magnetic-spectrometer-free setup (the PRad apparatus) to detect all three
final state particles in the visible decay of a hidden sector particle allowing
for an effective control of the background and will cover the proposed mass
range in a single setting. The use of the well-demonstrated PRad setup allows
for an essentially ready-to-run and uniquely cost-effective search for hidden
sector particles in the $3 - 60$ MeV mass range with a sensitivity of
8.9$\times$10$^{-8}$ - 5.8$\times$10$^{-9}$ to $\epsilon^2$, the square of the
kinetic mixing interaction constant between hidden and visible sectors. This
updated proposal includes our response to the PAC49 comments.

over a wide range of scales, is an extremely challenging problem. In
statistical mechanics, the Mori-Zwanzig (MZ) formalism provides a
mathematically formal procedure for constructing reduced-order representations
of high-dimensional dynamical systems, where the effect due to the unresolved
dynamics are captured in the memory kernel and orthogonal dynamics. Turbulence
models based on MZ formalism have been scarce due to the limited knowledge of
the MZ operators, which originates from the difficulty in deriving MZ kernels
for complex nonlinear dynamical systems. In this work, we apply a recently
developed data-driven learning algorithm, which is based on Koopman's
description of dynamical systems and Mori's linear projection operator, on a
set of fully-resolved isotropic turbulence datasets to extract the Mori-Zwanzig
operators. With data augmentation using known turbulence symmetries, the
extracted Markov term, memory kernel, and orthogonal dynamics are statistically
converged and the Generalized Fluctuation-Dissipation Relation can be verified.
The properties of the memory kernel and orthogonal dynamics, and their
dependence on the choices of observables are investigated to address the
modeling assumptions that are commonly used in MZ-based models. A series of
numerical experiments are then constructed using the extracted kernels to
evaluate the memory effects on predictions. Results show that the prediction
errors are strongly affected by the choice of observables and can be further
reduced by including the past history of the observables in the memory kernel.

strongly deform and envelop particles. This wrapping plays a key role in many

the safety assurance of ML-based components, proposals have recently emerged
for unit-level safety cases addressing these components. Unfortunately, AD

essential materials throughout branched geometries of neurons for their
survival and function. Many neurodegenerative diseases have been associated
with the disruption of transport. Therefore, it is essential to study how
neurons control the transport process to localize materials to necessary
locations. Here, we develop a novel optimization model to simulate the traffic
regulation mechanism of material transport in complex geometries of neurons.
The transport is controlled to avoid traffic jam of materials by minimizing a
pre-defined objective function. The optimization subjects to a set of partial
differential equation (PDE) constraints that describe the material transport
process based on a macroscopic molecular-motor-assisted transport model of
intracellular particles. The proposed PDE-constrained optimization model is
solved in complex tree structures by using isogeometric analysis (IGA).
Different simulation parameters are used to introduce traffic jams and study
how neurons handle the transport issue. Specifically, we successfully model and
explain the traffic jam caused by reduced number of microtubules (MTs) and MT
swirls. In summary, our model effectively simulates the material transport
process in healthy neurons and also explains the formation of a traffic jam in
abnormal neurons. Our results demonstrate that both geometry and MT structure
play important roles in achieving an optimal transport process in neuron.

exhibits a new type of transverse-momentum singularity, which has a quantum

amplitude (cross section) level, this transverse-momentum singularity produces
contributions to multijet production processes in hadron collisions. The

which proves the effectiveness of the Convention. The Gini coefficient of 0.66
shows the inequality in risk changes relative to income levels among regions,
but risk reductions across all nations vary without particularly high risks for
SIDS and LDCs than for large economies. Similarly, we reveal inequality in
economic impacts relative to income levels (the Gini coefficient is 0.58), but
there is no evidence that SIDS and LDCs are disproportionately impacted
compared to more developed regions. Most changes in GDP, real exports, and real
imports of studied regions are minor (smaller than 0.1%). However, there are
more noteworthy changes for select sectors and trade partners including Togo,

decentralized data. In federated learning, clients need to communicate their
local model updates in each iteration of model learning. However, model updates
are large in size if the model contains numerous parameters, and there usually
needs many rounds of communication until model converges. Thus, the
communication cost in federated learning can be quite heavy. In this paper, we
propose a communication efficient federated learning method based on knowledge
distillation. Instead of directly communicating the large models between
clients and server, we propose an adaptive mutual distillation framework to
reciprocally learn a student and a teacher model on each client, where only the
student model is shared by different clients and updated collaboratively to
reduce the communication cost. Both the teacher and student on each client are
learned on its local data and the knowledge distilled from each other, where
their distillation intensities are controlled by their prediction quality. To
further reduce the communication cost, we propose a dynamic gradient
approximation method based on singular value decomposition to approximate the
exchanged gradients with dynamic precision. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets in different tasks show that our approach can effectively reduce the
communication cost and achieve competitive results.

This can provide a valuable complement to analyses focussing on the causal
relation between individual treatment-outcome pairs. Constraint-based causal
discovery algorithms rely on conditional independence testing when building the
graph. Until recently, these algorithms have been unable to handle missing
values. In this paper, we investigate two alternative solutions: Test-wise
deletion and multiple imputation. We establish necessary and sufficient
conditions for the recoverability of causal structures under test-wise
deletion, and argue that multiple imputation is more challenging in the context
of causal discovery than for estimation. We conduct an extensive comparison by
simulating from benchmark causal graphs: As one might expect, we find that
test-wise deletion and multiple imputation both clearly outperform list-wise
deletion and single imputation. Crucially, our results further suggest that
multiple imputation is especially useful in settings with a small number of
either Gaussian or discrete variables, but when the dataset contains a mix of
both neither method is uniformly best. The methods we compare include random
forest imputation and a hybrid procedure combining test-wise deletion and
multiple imputation. An application to data from the IDEFICS cohort study on
diet- and lifestyle-related diseases in European children serves as an
illustrating example.

successful; it is the number one attack vector. Many approaches have been

Examples include nucleation of defects in crystalline materials, scars and
pleats in curved crystals, wrinkles in strongly confined thin sheets, and
cell-rearrangements in biological tissue. Available theories of such screening
usually contain a crucial ingredient, which is the existence of an ordered
reference state, with respect to which screening elements nucleate to release
stresses. In contradistinction, amorphous materials in which a unique reference
state does not exist, nevertheless exhibits plastic events that act as
screening geometric charges with significant implications on the mechanical
response. In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. E 104, 024904] it was proposed that
mechanical strains in amorphous solids can be either weakly or strongly
screened by the formation of low or high density of plastic events. At low
densities the screening effect is reminiscent of the role of dipoles in
dielectrics, in only renormalizing the elastic moduli. The effect of high
density screening has no immediate electrostatic analog and is expected to
change qualitatively the mechanical response, as seen for example in the
displacement field. On the basis of experiments and simulations, we show that
in granular matter, strong screening results in significant deviation from
elasticity theory. The theoretical analysis, which accounts for an emergent
inherent length scale, the experimental measurements and the numerical
simulations of frictional granular amorphous assemblies are in agreement with
each other, and provide a strong support for the novel continuum theory.

Collaboration (DESC) 3x2pt tomography challenge, which served as a first step
toward optimizing the tomographic binning strategy for the main DESC analysis.
The task of choosing an optimal tomographic binning scheme for a photometric
survey is made particularly delicate in the context of a metacalibrated lensing
catalogue, as only the photometry from the bands included in the
metacalibration process (usually riz and potentially g) can be used in sample
definition.
  The goal of the challenge was to collect and compare bin assignment
strategies under various metrics of a standard 3x2pt cosmology analysis in a
highly idealized setting to establish a baseline for realistically complex
follow-up studies; in this preliminary study, we used two sets of cosmological
simulations of galaxy redshifts and photometry under a simple noise model
neglecting photometric outliers and variation in observing conditions, and
contributed algorithms were provided with a representative and complete
training set.
  We review and evaluate the entries to the challenge, finding that even from
this limited photometry information, multiple algorithms can separate
tomographic bins reasonably well, reaching figures-of-merit scores close to the
attainable maximum. We further find that adding the g band to riz photometry
improves metric performance by ~15% and that the optimal bin assignment
strategy depends strongly on the science case: which figure-of-merit is to be
optimized, and which observables (clustering, lensing, or both) are included.

electronic shell structures of atoms. Nuclear shell structure varies across the
nuclear landscape due to changes of the nuclear mean field with the number of
neutrons $N$ and protons $Z$. These variations can be probed with mass
differences. The $N=Z=40$ self-conjugate nucleus $^{80}$Zr is of particular
interest as its proton and neutron shell structures are expected to be very
similar, and its ground state is highly deformed. In this work, we provide
evidence for the existence of a deformed double shell closure in $^{80}$Zr
through high precision Penning trap mass measurements of $^{80-83}$Zr. Our new
mass values show that $^{80}$Zr is significantly lighter, and thus more bound
than previously determined. This can be attributed to the deformed shell
closure at $N=Z=40$ and the large Wigner energy. Our statistical Bayesian model
mixing analysis employing several global nuclear mass models demonstrates
difficulties with reproducing the observed mass anomaly using current theory.

  engineering and component-based deep learning","17 pages",,,,"cs.LG cs.SE cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Data-driven models created by machine learning gain in importance in all
fields of design and engineering. They have high potential to assists
decision-makers in creating novel artefacts with better performance and
sustainability. However, limited generalization and the black-box nature of
these models lead to limited explainability and reusability. These drawbacks
provide significant barriers retarding adoption in engineering design. To
overcome this situation, we propose a component-based approach to create
partial component models by machine learning (ML). This component-based
approach aligns deep learning to systems engineering (SE). By means of the
example of energy efficient building design, we first demonstrate better
generalization of the component-based method by analyzing prediction accuracy
outside the training data. Especially for representative designs different in
structure, we observe a much higher accuracy (R2 = 0.94) compared to
conventional monolithic methods (R2 = 0.71). Second, we illustrate
explainability by exemplary demonstrating how sensitivity information from SE
and rules from low-depth decision trees serve engineering. Third, we evaluate
explainability by qualitative and quantitative methods demonstrating the
matching of preliminary knowledge and data-driven derived strategies and show
correctness of activations at component interfaces compared to white-box
simulation results (envelope components: R2 = 0.92..0.99; zones: R2 =
0.78..0.93). The key for component-based explainability is that activations at
interfaces between the components are interpretable engineering quantities. In
this way, the hierarchical component system forms a deep neural network (DNN)
that a priori integrates information for engineering explainability. ...

Being able to quantify homophily into a number has a significant real-world
impact, ranging from government fund-allocation to finetuning the parameters in
a sociological model. This paper introduces the Popularity-Homophily Index (PH
Index) as a new metric to measure homophily in directed graphs. The PH Index
takes into account the popularity of each actor in the interaction network,
with popularity precalculated with an importance algorithm like Google
PageRank. The PH Index improves upon other existing measures by weighting a
homophilic edge leading to an important actor over a homophilic edge leading to
a less important actor. The PH Index can be calculated not only for a single
node in a directed graph but also for the entire graph. This paper calculates
the PH Index of two sample graphs and concludes with an overview of the
strengths and weaknesses of the PH Index, and its potential applications in the

mitigate them. Choosing how and when to deploy those resources is, therefore, a
fateful decision. Here, I analyze the priority for allocating resources to
mitigate the risk of superintelligences.
  Part I observes that a superintelligence unconnected to the outside world
(de-efferented) carries no threat, and that any threat from a harmful
superintelligence derives from the peripheral systems to which it is connected,
e.g., nuclear weapons, biotechnology, etc. Because existentially-threatening
peripheral systems already exist and are controlled by humans, the initial
effects of a superintelligence would merely add to the existing human-derived
risk. This additive risk can be quantified and, with specific assumptions, is
shown to decrease with the square of the number of humans having the capability
to collapse civilization.
  Part II proposes that biotechnology ranks high in risk among peripheral
systems because, according to all indications, many humans already have the
technological capability to engineer harmful microbes having pandemic spread.
Progress in biomedicine and computing will proliferate this threat. ``Savant''
software that is not generally superintelligent will underpin much of this
progress, thereby becoming the software responsible for the highest and most
imminent existential risk -- ahead of hypothetical risk from
superintelligences.
  The analysis concludes that resources should be preferentially applied to

every year. However, the lack of support for i) locating contents of interest;
ii) discovering information on specific contents; and iii) ease of navigation
within the heritage site; hinders the overall experience of the visitor. To
this end, in this work, we present a Digital Object Space Management service
developed as a part of the VASARI project. The service generates a digital twin
(with 3D visualization) of a given cultural heritage site and further provides
support for navigation and localization, thereby providing an immersive
cultural experience to the visitor.

  Abstractive Summarization",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  State-of-the-art abstractive summarization systems often generate
\emph{hallucinations}; i.e., content that is not directly inferable from the
source text. Despite being assumed incorrect, we find that much hallucinated
content is factual, namely consistent with world knowledge. These factual
hallucinations can be beneficial in a summary by providing useful background
information. In this work, we propose a novel detection approach that separates
factual from non-factual hallucinations of entities. Our method utilizes an
entity's prior and posterior probabilities according to pre-trained and
finetuned masked language models, respectively. Empirical results suggest that
our approach vastly outperforms two baselines %in both accuracy and F1 scores
and strongly correlates with human judgments. % on factuality classification
tasks. Furthermore, we show that our detector, when used as a reward signal in
an off-line reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, significantly improves the
factuality of summaries while maintaining the level of abstractiveness.

complex problems with large search spaces that reliably yields good
optimisation results. However, with the rise of cyber-physical systems, emerges
a new challenge of noisy fitness functions, whose objective value for a given
configuration is non-deterministic, producing varying results on each
execution. This leads to an optimisation process that is based on
stochastically sampled information, ultimately favouring solutions with fitness
values that have co-incidentally high outlier noise. In turn, the results are
unfaithful due to their large discrepancies between sampled and expectable
objective values. Motivated by our work on noisy automated driving systems, we
present the results of our ongoing research to counteract the effect of noisy
fitness functions without requiring repeated executions of each solution. Our
method kNN-Avg identifies the k-nearest neighbours of a solution point and uses
the weighted average value as a surrogate for its actually sampled fitness. We
demonstrate the viability of kNN-Avg on common benchmark problems and show that
it produces comparably good solutions whose fitness values are closer to the
expected value.

new actuarial-consistent procedure, which we call ""two-step actuarial

actuarial-consistent valuations are equivalent to two-step actuarial

increasing fatigue crack growth rates and decreasing the number of cycles to

hydrogen concentrations. In addition, Virtual S-N curves are obtained for both
notched and smooth samples, exhibiting a good agreement with experiments.
