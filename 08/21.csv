neutrino- and electron-nucleon scattering cross sections using effective
leading order parton distribution functions with a new scaling variable
$\xi_w$. Non-perturbative effects are well described using the $\xi_w$ scaling
variable in combination with multiplicative $K$ factors at low $Q^2$. The model
describes all inelastic charged-leptron-nucleon scattering data
(HERA/NMC/BCDMS/SLAC/JLab) ranging from very high $Q^2$ to very low $Q^2$ and
down to the $Q^2=0$ photo-production region. The model has been developed to be
used in analysis of neutrino oscillation experiments in the few GeV region. The
2021 update accounts for the difference between axial and vector structure
function which brings it into much better agreement with neutrino-nucleon total
cross section measurements. The model has been developed primarily for hadronic
final state masses $W$ above 1.8 GeV. However with additional parameters the
model also describe the $average$ neutrino cross sections in the resonance
region down to $W$=1.4 GeV.

sentence containing both entities or a fact in a Knowledge Graph (KG). However,
these instances may not well capture the general relations between entities,
may be difficult to understand by humans, even may not be found due to the
incompleteness of the knowledge source. In this paper, we introduce the Open
Relation Modeling problem - given two entities, generate a coherent sentence
describing the relation between them. To solve this problem, we propose to
teach machines to generate definition-like relation descriptions by letting
them learn from defining entities. Specifically, we fine-tune Pre-trained
Language Models (PLMs) to produce definitions conditioned on extracted entity
pairs. To help PLMs reason between entities and provide additional relational
knowledge to PLMs for open relation modeling, we incorporate reasoning paths in
KGs and include a reasoning path selection mechanism. Experimental results show
that our model can generate concise but informative relation descriptions that
capture the representative characteristics of entities.

often characterized by a streamwise-oriented vortex pair, whose strength

characteristics of the vortex pair emerging over an abstraction comprised of a
streamwise-aligned cylinder terminated with an upswept plane. The Reynolds
number is fixed at 5000 and the upsweep angle is increased from 20deg to 32deg.
At 20deg, the LES yields a steady streamwise-oriented vortex pair, and the
global modes are also stable. At 32deg, the LES displays unsteady flow
behavior. Linear analysis of the mean flow reveals different unstable modes.
The lowest oscillation frequency is an antisymmetric mode, which is attached to
the entire slanted base. At the highest frequency, the mode is symmetric and
has the same rotational orientation as the mean vortex pair. Its support is
prominent in the rear part of the slanted base and spreads relatively rapidly
downstream with prominent helical structures. A receptivity analysis of low-
and high-frequency modes suggests the latter holds promise to affect the
vortical flow, providing a potential starting point for a control strategy to
modify the vortex pair.

and advection-diffusion equations to regularize reconstructions. Tomography is
increasingly employed to infer 2D or 3D fluid flow and combustion structures
from a series of line-of-sight (LoS) integrated measurements using a wide array
of imaging modalities. The high-dimensional flow field is reconstructed from
low-dimensional measurements by inverting a projection model that comprises
path integrals along each LoS through the region of interest. Regularization
techniques are needed to obtain realistic estimates, but current methods rely
on truncating an iterative solution or adding a penalty term that is
incompatible with the flow physics to varying degrees. Physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs) are new tools for inverse analysis that enable regularization
of the flow field estimates using the governing physics. We demonstrate how a
PINN can be leveraged to reconstruct a 2D flow field from sparse LoS-integrated
measurements with no knowledge of the boundary conditions by incorporating the
measurement model into the loss function used to train the network. The
resulting reconstructions are remarkably superior to reconstructions produced
by state-of-the-art algorithms, even when a PINN is used for post-processing.
However, as with conventional iterative algorithms, our approach is susceptible
to semi-convergence when there is a high level of noise. We address this issue
through the use of a Bayesian PINN, which facilitates comprehensive uncertainty
quantification of the reconstructions, enables the use of a more intuitive loss
function, and reveals the source of semi-convergence.

offer unique challenges for this technique. Further, specification miners
traditionally capture functional specifications without a notion of security,

  This work demonstrates specification mining for hardware security. On CISC

carriers alters the statistics of rogue waves by enhancing their formation in
smaller ratios of carrier lifetimes in the active and passive materials while
suppressing them when the ratio is larger. Temporal dynamics of the emitted
rogue waves is also studied and shown that finite nonzero transverse carrier
diffusion coefficient gives them a longer duration. To further approach the
realistic experimental situation, we also investigated statistics and dynamics
of rogue waves by simulating a circular disk-shape pump which replaces the flat
pump profile typically used in numerical simulations of broad-area lasers. We
show that finite pump shape reduces the number emitted rogue waves per unit
area for large carrier lifetime ratios and increases that for smaller values of
the ratio in both below and above laser threshold. Temporal width of the
emitted rogue waves is also shown to reduce as a consequence of removing the
nonphysical effects of infinite flat pump on carrier dynamics.

the torque from the binary speeds up the planet formation process by promoting
body-body interactions but also drives the ejection of planet building material
from the system at an early time. Fewer but more massive planets form around a
close binary compared to a single star system. A sufficiently wide or eccentric
binary can prohibit terrestrial planet formation. Eccentric binaries and
exterior giant planets exacerbate these effects as they both reduce the radial
range of the stable orbits. However, with a large enough stable region, the
planets that do form are more massive, more eccentric and more inclined. The
giant planets remain on stable orbits in all our simulations suggesting that

the edges of the network. It is clear that over short length scales a particle
moves along a single edge and thus undergoes one-dimensional diffusion.
However, on larger length scales it is no longer immediately clear how the
transport will behave. One could intuit that as the network is embedded in two
dimensions for ""large enough"" length scales the transport will also appear
two-dimensional. Is this true for all networks? Can we quantify the length
scales upon which this transition occurs? What is the transport behaviour on
intermediate spatial scales? In this paper, we answer these question by
presenting a numerical linear algebra approach that provides the exact moments
of first passage times for a given network. Comparing these networked
first-passage times to first-passage times for planar diffusion reveals several
interesting properties of networked transport. In particular we can directly
quantify the length scale upon which networked diffusion will appear planar if
it does at all. Finally, we introduce an adaptation of the method of maximum

refractive index, known as Veselago lensing, may enable optical imaging below
the diffraction limit. Similarly, focusing electrons across a $pn$-junction
could realize a technologically promising electronic Veselago lens. However,
its scope remains limited by the lack of three-dimensional platforms and its
insensitivity to computational degrees of freedom, like spin or chirality. Here
we propose a single-material three-dimensional electronic Veselago lens that
selectively focuses electrons of a given chirality. Using the chiral anomaly of
topological semimetals it is possible to create a sharp $pn$-junction for a
single chirality, a chiral Veselago lens, and tune it with a magnetic field to
an ideal lensing condition. We estimate that chiral Veselago lensing is
observable in non-local transport and spectroscopy experiments. In particular
we show that the chiral Veselago lens leads to giant non-local
magnetoresistance.

inversion problem has been systematically solved using maximum a-posteriori
regularized methods assuming smoothness or maximum entropy. Our aim in this
work is to solve the full Bayesian inference problem, by providing access to
the posterior distribution of the surface temperature in the star. We use
amortized neural posterior estimation to produce a model that approximates the
high-dimensional posterior distribution for spectroscopic observations of
selected spectral ranges sampled at arbitrary rotation phases. The posterior
distribution is approximated with conditional normalizing flows, which are
flexible, tractable and easy to sample approximations to arbitrary
distributions. When conditioned on the spectroscopic observations, they provide
a very efficient way of obtaining samples from the posterior distribution. The
conditioning on observations is obtained through the use of Transformer
encoders, which can deal with arbitrary wavelength sampling and rotation
phases. Our model can produce thousands of posterior samples per second. Our
validation of the model for very high signal-to-noise observations shows that
it correctly approximates the posterior, although with some overestimation of
the broadening. We apply the model to the moderately fast rotator II Peg,
producing the first Bayesian map of its temperature inhomogenities. We conclude
that conditional normalizing flows are a very promising tool to carry out
approximate Bayesian inference in more complex problems in stellar physics,

observed that these ingredients can lead to a fundamental, density-dependent
dephasing of optical spin waves in a disordered atomic medium. Here, we go
beyond the short-time and dilute limits considered previously, to develop a
comprehensive theory of dephasing dynamics for arbitrary times and atomic
densities. In particular, we develop a novel, non-perturbative theory based on
strong disorder renormalization group, in order to quantitatively predict the
dominant role that near-field optical interactions between nearby neighbors has
in driving the dephasing process. This theory also enables one to capture the
key features of the many-atom dephasing dynamics in terms of an effective
single-atom model. These results should shed light on the limits imposed by
near-field interactions on quantum optical phenomena in dense atomic media, and
illustrate the promise of strong disorder renormalization group as a method of
dealing with complex microscopic optical phenomena in such systems.

under the joint and individual privacy guarantees. In this problem, identical
copies of a dataset comprised of $K$ messages are stored on $N$ non-colluding
servers, and a user wishes to obtain one linear combination of a $D$-subset of
messages belonging to the dataset. The goal is to design a scheme for
performing the computation such that the total amount of information downloaded
from the servers is minimized, while the privacy of the $D$ messages required
for the computation is protected. When joint privacy is required, the
identities of all of these $D$ messages must be kept private jointly, and when
individual privacy is required, the identity of every one of these $D$ messages
must be kept private individually. In this work, we characterize the capacity,
which is defined as the maximum achievable download rate, under both joint and
individual privacy requirements. In particular, we show that when joint privacy
is required the capacity is given by ${(1+1/N+\dots+1/N^{K-D})^{-1}}$, and when
individual privacy is required the capacity is given by
${(1+1/N+\dots+1/N^{\lceil K/D\rceil-1})^{-1}}$ assuming that $D$ divides $K$,
or $K\pmod D$ divides $D$. Our converse proofs are based on reduction from two
variants of the multi-server Private Information Retrieval problem in the
presence of side information. Our achievability schemes build up on our
recently proposed schemes for single-server Private Linear Transformation and
the multi-server private computation scheme proposed by Sun and Jafar. Using
similar proof techniques, we also establish upper and lower bounds on the
capacity for the cases in which the user wants to compute $L$ (potentially more

found that the morphology of the Wolf-Rayet nebulae of blue supergiant

transition time interval, generating either a broadened peanut-like or a
collimated jet-like gas nebula. Radiative transfer calculations of our
Wolf-Rayet nebulae for dust infrared emission at 24 $\mu$m show that the

time dependence of complexity and the complexity of formation for two
dimensional states dual to rotating BTZ. The obtained results and their
dependence on angular momentum turn out to be analogous to those of charged
states dual to Reissner-Nordstr\""om AdS black holes. For CA, our computation
carefully accounts for the counterterm in the gravity action, which was not
included in previous analysis in the literature. This affects the complexity
early time dependence and its effect becomes negligible close to extremality.
In the grand canonical ensemble, the CA and CV complexity of formation are
linear in the temperature, and diverge with the same structure in the speed of
light angular velocity limit. For CA the inclusion of the counterterm is
crucial for both effects. We also address the problem of studying holographic
complexity for higher dimensional rotating black holes, focusing on the four
dimensional Kerr-AdS case. Carefully taking into account all ingredients, we
show that the late time limit of the CA growth rate saturates the expected
bound, and find the CV complexity of formation of large black holes diverges in
the critical angular velocity limit. Our holographic analysis is complemented

the decays $B^0\to\mu^+\mu^-$ and $B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-\gamma$ are performed at
the LHCb experiment using data collected in proton-proton collisions at
$\sqrt{s} = 7,~8$ and $13$ TeV, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 1,
2 and 6 fb$^{-1}$, respectively. The $B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ branching fraction
and effective lifetime are measured to be
${\mathcal{B}}(B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-)=\left(3.09^{+0.46+0.15}_{-0.43-0.11}\right)\times
10^{-9}$ and $\tau(B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-)=(2.07\pm 0.29\pm 0.03)$ ps,
respectively, where the uncertainties include both statistical and systematic
contributions. No significant signal for $B^0\to\mu^+\mu^-$ and
$B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-\gamma$ decays is found and the upper limits
$\mathcal{B}(B^0\to\mu^+\mu^-)<2.6\times 10^{-10}$ and
$\mathcal{B}(B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-\gamma)<2.0\times 10^{-9}$ at 95% confidence
level are determined, where the latter is limited to the range $m_{\mu\mu} >
4.9$ GeV$/c^2$. Additionally, the ratio between the $B^0\to\mu^+\mu^-$ and
$B^0_s\to\mu^+\mu^-$ branching fractions is measured to be
$\mathcal{R}_{\mu^+\mu^-}<0.095$ at 95% confidence level. The results are in
agreement with the Standard Model predictions.

hard cylindrical channel, such that spheres can only contact their first and
second neighbours, is studied using an analytical model that extends previous
results [Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 025702 (2015)] to provide a comprehensive
picture of jammed packings over a range of packing densities. In the model, a
packing is described as an arrangement of $k$ helical sections, separated by
defects, that have alternating helical twist directions and where all spheres
satisfy local jamming constraints. The structure of each helical section is
determined by a single helical twist angle, and a jammed packing is obtained by
minimizing the length of the channel per particle with respect to the $k$
helical section angles. An analysis of a small system of $N=20$ spheres shows
that the basins on the inherent structure landscape associated with these
helical arrangements split into a number of distinct jammed states separated by
low barriers giving rise to a degree of hierarchical organization. The model
accurately predicts the geometric properties of packings generated using the
Lubachevsky and Stillinger compression scheme ($N=10^4$) and provides insight
into the nature of the probability distribution of helical section lengths.

  reionization signals in the CMB","7 pages, 3 figures; comments welcome",,"10.1093/mnras/stac3146",,"astro-ph.CO hep-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The search for cosmic polarization rotation or birefringence in the CMB is
well-motivated because it can provide powerful constraints on parity-violating
new physics, such as axion-like particles. In this paper we point out that
since the CMB polarization is produced at two very different redshifts - it is
generated at both reionization and recombination - new parity-violating physics
can generically rotate the polarization signals from these different sources by
different amounts. We explore two implications of this. First, measurements of
CMB birefringence are challenging because the effect is degenerate with a
miscalibration of CMB polarization angles; however, by taking the difference of
the reionization and recombination birefringence angles (measured from
different CMB angular scales), we can obtain a cosmological signal that is
immune to instrumental angle miscalibration. Second, we note that the
combination with other methods for probing birefringence can give tomographic
information, constraining the redshift origin of any physics producing
birefringence. We forecast that the difference of the reionization and
recombination birefringence angles can be competitively determined to within
~0.05 degrees for future CMB satellites such as LiteBIRD. Although much further
work is needed, we argue that foreground mitigation for this measurement should
be less challenging than for inflationary B-mode searches on similar scales due
to larger signals and lower foregrounds.

$100-1000$ comoving kpc around $z=3.3$ LAEs at the $4.1\sigma$ level and

SB_{Ly\alpha}}$ profiles have similar amplitudes at $z=2.2-6.6$ within the
uncertainties, the intrinsic ${\rm SB_{Ly\alpha}}$ profiles (corrected for the
cosmological dimming effect) increase toward high redshifts. This trend may be
explained by increasing hydrogen gas density due to the evolution of the cosmic
volume. Comparisons with theoretical models suggest that extended Ly$\alpha$
emission around a LAE is powered by resonantly scattered Ly$\alpha$ photons in
the CGM and IGM that originates from the inner part of the LAE, and/or
neighboring galaxies around the LAE.

Ly$\alpha$ by enclosing the optical path, so the detector only receives light

but the overall effective area can be regained and improved through the use of
new high efficiency reflective coatings, and with the use of a blazed
diffraction grating. This latter key technology has been enabled by recent
advancements in creating very high efficiency blazed gratings with impressive
smoothness using electron beam lithography and chemical etching to create
grooves in crystalline silicon. Here we discuss the derivation for the
OAxFORTIS grating solution as well as methods used to transform the FORTIS
holographic grating recording parameters (following the formalism of Noda et

Remarkably, no entropy is produced at the end of matter domination and hence
these eras of matter and kination domination may occur even after Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis. We derive constraints on these eras from both the cosmic
microwave background and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. We investigate how this

future observations of gravitational waves can probe the viable parameter

misalignment mechanism or the baryon asymmetry by axiogenesis. For QCD axion
dark matter produced by the kinetic misalignment mechanism, a modification to
the inflationary gravitational wave spectrum occurs above 0.01 Hz and, for high

standard single-label ZSL since several objects can co-exist in a natural
image. However, the occurrence of multiple objects complicates the reasoning
and requires region-specific processing of visual features to preserve their
contextual cues. We note that the best existing multi-label ZSL method takes a
shared approach towards attending to region features with a common set of
attention maps for all the classes. Such shared maps lead to diffused
attention, which does not discriminatively focus on relevant locations when the
number of classes are large. Moreover, mapping spatially-pooled visual features
to the class semantics leads to inter-class feature entanglement, thus
hampering the classification. Here, we propose an alternate approach towards
region-based discriminability-preserving multi-label zero-shot classification.
Our approach maintains the spatial resolution to preserve region-level
characteristics and utilizes a bi-level attention module (BiAM) to enrich the
features by incorporating both region and scene context information. The
enriched region-level features are then mapped to the class semantics and only
their class predictions are spatially pooled to obtain image-level predictions,
thereby keeping the multi-class features disentangled. Our approach sets a new
state of the art on two large-scale multi-label zero-shot benchmarks: NUS-WIDE
and Open Images. On NUS-WIDE, our approach achieves an absolute gain of 6.9%
mAP for ZSL, compared to the best published results.

clearly alters the physical properties of the films. Structural
characterization shows that both La-rich and V-rich films have different levels
of structural distortion, with La-rich (V-rich) films showing a larger
(smaller) out-of-plane lattice parameter compared to what one would expect from
epitaxial strain effects alone. Both types of films show deviation from the
behavior of bulk LVO in optical measurement, i.e., they do not show signatures
of the expected long range orbital order, which can be a result of the
structural distortions or the presence of structural domains. In transport
measurements, La-rich films display clear signatures of electronic phase
separation accompanying a temperature induced metal-insulator transition, while
V-rich films behave as Mott insulators. The out-of-plane lattice parameter
plays a crucial role in determining the transport properties, as the crossover
from Mott-insulating to disorder-induced phase-separated behavior occurs around

particles effectively hop on a discrete tessellation of 2D hyperbolic space, a
non-Euclidean space of uniform negative curvature. To describe the
single-particle eigenstates and eigenenergies for hopping on such a lattice, a
hyperbolic generalization of band theory was previously constructed, based on
ideas from algebraic geometry. In this hyperbolic band theory, eigenstates are
automorphic functions, and the Brillouin zone is a higher-dimensional torus,
the Jacobian of the compactified unit cell understood as a higher-genus Riemann
surface. Three important questions were left unanswered: whether a band theory
can be expected to hold for a non-Euclidean lattice, where translations do not
generally commute; whether a formal Bloch theorem can be rigorously
established; and whether hyperbolic band theory can describe finite lattices
realized in experiment. In the present work, we address all three questions
simultaneously. By formulating periodic boundary conditions for finite but
arbitrarily large lattices, we show that a generalized Bloch theorem can be
rigorously proved, but may or may not involve higher-dimensional irreducible
representations (irreps) of the nonabelian translation group, depending on the
lattice geometry. Higher-dimensional irreps corrrespond to points in a moduli
space of higher-rank stable holomorphic vector bundles, which further
generalizes the notion of Brillouin zone beyond the Jacobian. For a large class
of finite lattices, only 1D irreps appear, and the hyperbolic band theory

metastability of the electroweak vacuum, i.e., that whatever mechanism is
responsible for the latter also sets the running Higgs mass to a value smaller
than its natural value by many orders of magnitude. This perspective is
motivated by the early-time framework for eternal inflation put forth recently,
which favors vacua that are relatively short-lived, but applies more generally
to any theoretical approach predicting that our vacuum should be metastable. We
find that the metastability of the electroweak vacuum, together with the
requirement that such a non-trivial vacuum exists, requires the Higgs mass to
be smaller than the instability scale by around one order of magnitude. While
this bound is quite weak in the Standard Model (SM), as the instability scale
is $\sim 10^{11}$ GeV, simple and well-motivated extensions of the SM -
concretely, the $\nu$MSM with an approximate $B-\tilde{L}$ symmetry and the
minimal SU(4)/Sp(4) composite Higgs model - can significantly tighten the bound
by lowering the instability scale. We find that the bound can be brought down
to $\simeq 10$ TeV where our perturbative treatment of the decay rate becomes
unreliable. Our results imply that, assuming the SM symmetry breaking pattern,
small running Higgs masses are a universal property of theories giving rise to
metastability, suggesting a common origin of the two underlying fine-tunings
and providing a strong constraint on any attempt to explain metastability.

around the phase transition generates the stochastic background of GW with peak
frequencies lower than the ideal gas-based signal (around nHz). Instead, the
strain amplitudes corresponding to the peak frequencies are of the same order
of magnitude of the expected signal from ideal gas. This may be promising in
the sense that although the strong magnetic field could mask the expected
stochastic background of GWs by upgrading the frequency sensitivity of
detectors in the future, the magnetized GW is expected to be identified. Faced
with the projected reach of detectors EPTA, IPTA, and SKA, we find that for the
tail of the magnetized GW signals there remains a mild possibility of detection

Numerically resolving singular current sheets in the ideal MHD limit has been a

multi-region relaxed magnetohydrodynamics (MRxMHD), where the solution relaxes
to a Taylor state in each region while maintaining force balance across the

solution approaches the ideal MHD solution assuming a continuum of nested flux
surfaces. We demonstrate excellent agreement between the numerical solutions
obtained from the two codes through a thorough convergence study.

$p-$wave superconducting order. Assuming that the $p$-wave superconducting
order is in either a chiral or helical phase, we find that when a $d_{x^2-y^2}$
wave superconducting order is induced, the system exhibits quite different
behavior depending on the nature of the parent $p$-wave phase. In particular,
we find that while in the helical phase, a localized Majorana mode appears at
each of the four corners, in the chiral phase, it is localized only along two
of the four edges. We furthermore demonstrate that the Majoranas can be
directly controlled by the form of the edges, as we explicitly show in case of
the circular edges. We argue that the application of strain may provide
additional means of fine-tuning the Majorana zero modes in the system, in
particular, it can partially gap them out. Our findings may be relevant for
probing the topology in two-dimensional mixed-pairing superconductors.

min-shuffle decomposition. The former is used to extract shuffling patterns
from shear coupled migration trajectories and the latter is used to analyze
temperature dependent shuffling mechanisms. As an application of the
displacement texture framework, we characterize the GB geometry dependence of
shuffling mechanisms for a crystallographically diverse set of mobile GBs in
FCC Ni bicrystals. Two scientific contributions from this analysis include 1)
an explanation of the boundary plane dependence of shuffling patterns via
metastable GB geometry and 2) a taxonomy of multimodal constrained GB migration

understanding the role of heterogeneity by investigating the effects of

payoff fluctuations induce a very slow dynamic, making the cooperation decay
behave as power laws with varying exponents, instead of the usual exponential
decay after the critical point, showing the emergence of a Griffiths phase. We
also find a symmetric Griffiths phase near the defector's extinction point when

input's complexity by using early-exit DNNs. These DNNs have side branches
throughout their architecture, allowing the inference to end earlier in the
edge. The branches estimate the accuracy for a given input. If this estimated
accuracy reaches a threshold, the inference ends on the edge. Otherwise, the
edge offloads the inference to the cloud to process the remaining DNN layers.
However, DNNs for image classification deals with distorted images, which
negatively impact the branches' estimated accuracy. Consequently, the edge
offloads more inferences to the cloud. This work introduces expert side
branches trained on a particular distortion type to improve robustness against
image distortion. The edge detects the distortion type and selects appropriate
expert branches to perform the inference. This approach increases the estimated
accuracy on the edge, improving the offloading decisions. We validate our

between neighboring repeater nodes, with probability $p$ in each time slot, and
performs Bell State Measurements at nodes with success probability $q<1$, the
end to end entanglement generation rate drops exponentially with the distance
between consumers, despite multi-path routing. If repeaters can perform
multi-qubit projective measurements in the GHZ basis that succeed with
probability $q$, the rate does not change with distance in a certain $(p,q)$
region, but decays exponentially outside. This region where the distance
independent rate occurs is the supercritical region of a new percolation
problem. We extend this GHZ protocol to incorporate a time-multiplexing
blocklength $k$, the number of time slots over which a repeater can
mix-and-match successful links to perform fusion on. As $k$ increases, the
supercritical region expands. For a given $(p,q)$, the entanglement rate
initially increases with $k$, and once inside the supercritical region for a
high enough $k$, it decays as $1/k$ GHZ states per time slot. When memory
coherence time exponentially distributed with mean $\mu$ is incorporated, it is
seen that increasing $k$ does not indefinitely increase the supercritical

incorporating space-division multiplexing, i.e., running the above protocol
independently in up to $d$ disconnected network regions, where $d$ is the
network's node degree, one can go beyond the 1 GHZ state per time slot rate

Specifically, leveraging the benefits of Transformer on language understanding,
we train a personalized language model to construct a general user profile from

The dynamic profile mainly describes what and how the user has responded to
similar posts in history. To explicitly utilize users' frequently used words,
we design a personalized decoder to fuse two decoding strategies, including
generating a word from the generic vocabulary and copying one word from the

the magnetized, multiphase interstellar medium (ISM). In this work, we
post-process a high-resolution TIGRESS magnetohydrodynamic simulation modeling
a local galactic disk patch with a two-moment fluid algorithm for cosmic ray
transport. We consider a variety of prescriptions for the cosmic rays, from a
simple purely diffusive formalism with constant scattering coefficient, to a
physically-motivated model in which the scattering coefficient is set by
critical balance between streaming-driven Alfv\'en wave excitation and damping
mediated by local gas properties. We separately focus on cosmic rays with
kinetic energies of $\sim 1$ GeV (high-energy) and $\sim 30$~MeV (low-energy),
respectively important for ISM dynamics and chemistry. We find that
simultaneously accounting for advection, streaming, and diffusion of cosmic
rays is crucial for properly modeling their transport. Advection dominates in
the high-velocity, low-density, hot phase, while diffusion and streaming are
more important in higher density, cooler phases. Our physically-motivated model
shows that there is no single diffusivity for cosmic-ray transport: the
scattering coefficient varies by four or more orders of magnitude, maximal at
density $n_\mathrm{H} \sim 0.01\, \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. Ion-neutral damping of
Alfv\'en waves results in strong diffusion and nearly uniform cosmic ray
pressure within most of the mass of the ISM. However, cosmic rays are trapped
near the disk midplane by the higher scattering rate in the surrounding
lower-density, higher-ionization gas. The transport of high-energy cosmic rays
differs from that of low-energy cosmic rays, with less effective diffusion and
greater energy losses for the latter.

Iron oxides, such as LaFeO$_{3}$, are particularly promising due to the

epitaxial films of varying thicknesses on Nb-doped SrTiO$_{3}$. Using cyclic

As our first goal, we construct a family
$\mathcal{M}_G$ of Gibbs like measures on the set of piecewise linear convex
functions $g:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}$. It turns out that there is a
one-to-one correspondence between the gradient of such convex functions and
$\textit{Laguerre tessellations}$. Each cell in a Laguerre tessellation is a
convex polygon that is marked by a vector $\rho\in\mathbb{R}^2$. Each measure
$\nu^f\in\mathcal{M}_G$ in our family is uniquely characterized by a kernel
$f(x,\rho^-,\rho^+)$, which represents the rate at which a line separating two
cells associated with marks $\rho^-$ and $\rho^+$ passes through $x$. To
construct our measures, we give a precise recipe for the law of the restriction
of our tessellation to a box. This recipe involves a boundary condition, and a
dynamical description of our random tessellation inside the box. As we enlarge
the box, the consistency of these random tessellations requires that the kernel
satisfies a suitable kinetic like PDE. As our second goal, we study the
invariance of the set $\mathcal{M}_G$ with respect to the dynamics of such
Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs. In particular we $\textit{conjecture}$ the invariance of
a suitable subfamily $\widehat{\mathcal{M}_G}$ of $\mathcal{M}_G$. More
precisely, we expect that if the initial slope $u_x(\cdot,0)$ is selected
according to a measure $\nu^{f}\in \widehat{\mathcal{M}_G}$, then at a later
time the law of $u_x(\cdot, t)$ is given by a measure
$\nu^{\Theta_t(f)}\in\widehat{\mathcal{M}_G}$, for a suitable kernel
$\Theta_t(f)$. As we vary $t$, the kernel $\Theta_t(f)$ must satisfy a suitable
kinetic equation. We remark that the function $u$ is also piecewise linear
convex function in $(x,t)$, and its law is an example of a Gibbs-like measure
on the set of Laguerre tessellations of certain convex subsets of
$\mathbb{R}^3$.

increases variability and uncertainty of the net demand, making the power
system operation challenging. Operating reserve is used by system operators to
manage and hedge against such variability and uncertainty. Traditionally,
reserve requirements are determined by rules-of-thumb (static reserve
requirements, e.g., NERC Reliability Standards), and more recently, dynamic
reserve requirements from tools and methods which are in the adoption process
(e.g., DynADOR, DRD, and RESERVE, among others). While these methods/tools
significantly improve the static rule-of-thumb approaches, they rely
exclusively on deterministic data (i.e., best guess only). Consequently, these
methods disregard the probabilistic uncertainty thresholds associated with
specific days and their weather conditions (i.e., best guess plus probabilistic
uncertainty).
  This work presents practical approaches to determine the operating reserve
requirements leveraging the wealth information from probabilistic forecasts.
Proposed approaches are validated and tested using actual data from the CAISO
system. Results show the benefits in terms of risk reduction of considering the
probabilistic forecast information into the dimensioning process of operating

that it allows us to probe the properties of the proposed multi-boundary TFD

pyramids made of alternating stacks of metal/dielectric layers. We target
ultra-broadband quasi-perfect absorption of normally incident electromagnetic
radiations in the visible and near-infrared ranges (wavelength comprised

one, two or three stacks of either Ni, Ti, Al, Cr, Ag, Cu, Au or W for the
metal, and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) for the dielectric. More than 10^17
configurations of geometrical parameters are explored and reduced to a few
optimal ones. This extensive study shows that Ni/PMMA, Ti/PMMA, Cr/PMMA and
W/PMMA provide high-quality solutions with an integrated absorptance higher
than 99% over the considered wavelength range, when considering realistic
implementation of these ultra-broadband perfect electromagnetic absorbers.
Robustness of optimal solutions with respect to geometrical parameters is
investigated and local absorption maps are provided. Moreover, we confirm that
these optimal solutions maintain quasi-perfect broadband absorption properties
over a broad angular range when changing the inclination of the incident
radiation.
  The study also reveals that noble metals (Au, Ag, Cu) do not provide the

However, it is a challenging task requiring numerous information from the scene

explicit model using an ellipsoid whose projection fits the specularity image
contours for a given camera pose. These ellipsoid-based approaches belong to a
family of models called JOint-LIght MAterial Specularity (JOLIMAS), which we
have gradually improved by removing assumptions on the scene geometry. However,
our most recent approach is still limited to uniformly curved surfaces. This
paper generalises JOLIMAS to any surface geometry while improving the quality

proposed method establishes a link between surface curvature and specularity
shape in order to lift the geometric assumptions made in previous work.
Contrary to previous work, our new model is built from a physics-based local
illumination model namely Torrance-Sparrow, providing an improved
reconstruction. Specularity prediction using our new model is tested against
the most recent JOLIMAS version on both synthetic and real sequences with

first extend the existing least squares (LS) ON/OFF channel estimation protocol
to a multi-user system, where we derive minimum mean squared error (MMSE)
estimates of all RIS-assisted channels over multiple sub-phases. We also
consider a low-complexity direct estimation (DE) scheme, where the BS obtains
the MMSE estimate of the overall channel in a single sub-phase. Under both
protocols, the BS implements maximum ratio transmission (MRT) precoding while
the RIS phases are studied in the large system limit, where we derive
deterministic equivalents of the signal- to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) and the sum-rate. The derived asymptotic expressions reveal that under
Rayleigh fading, the RIS phase-shift values do not play a significant role in
improving the sum-rate but the RIS still provides an array gain. However, under
Rician fading, we show that RIS provides both array and reflect beamforming
gains. A projected gradient ascent-based algorithm is used to optimize the

been separately gathered from video observations. Despite considerable advances
in automated tracking, these methods are still very expensive or unreliable
when tracking large numbers of animals simultaneously. Moreover, this approach
assumes that the human-chosen features include sufficient features to explain
important patterns in collective behavior. To address these issues, we propose
training deep network models to predict system-level states directly from
generic graphical features from the entire view, which can be relatively
inexpensive to gather in a completely automated fashion. Because the resulting
predictive models are not based on human-understood predictors, we use
explanatory modules (e.g., Grad-CAM) that combine information hidden in the
latent variables of the deep-network model with the video data itself to
communicate to a human observer which aspects of observed individual behaviors

trajectory of a nonlinear simple pendulum undergoing librating and rotating
motion for all time. Although the series coefficients were previously given in
[V. Fair\'en, V. L\'opez, and L. Conde, Am. J. Phys 56 (1), (1988), pp. 57-61],
the series itself -- as well as the optimal location about which an expansion
should be chosen to assure series convergence and maximize the domain of
convergence -- was not examined, and is provided here. By virtue of its
representation as an elliptic function, the pendulum function has singularities
that lie off of the real axis in the complex time plane. This, in turn, imposes
a radius of convergence on the physical problem in real time. By choosing the
expansion point at the top of the trajectory, the power series converges all
the way to the bottom of the trajectory without being affected by these
singularities. In constructing the series solution, we re-derive the
coefficients using an alternative approach that generalizes to other nonlinear
problems of mathematical physics. Additionally, we provide an exact resummation
of the pendulum series -- Motivated by the asymptotic approximant method given
in [Barlow et al., Q. J. Mech. Appl. Math., 70 (1) (2017), pp. 21-48] -- that
accelerates the series' convergence uniformly from the top to the bottom of the
trajectory. We also provide an accelerated exact resummation of the infinite
series representation for the elliptic integral used in calculating the period
of a pendulum's trajectory. This allows one to preserve analyticity in the use
of the period to extend the pendulum series for all time via symmetry.

to remain near the endothelium for extended periods, including a novel platelet
motion that can be seen only in 3-dimensional simulations that we term

platelets and the endothelium for which the platelet has reduced speed. We

quantum walk in the loopless hypercube. We saw that neighbor vertices are also
amplified and that approximately $1/2$ of the system energy is concentrated in
them. We show that the optimal value of $l$ for a single marked vertex is not
optimal for multiple marked vertices. We define a new value of $l = (n/N)\cdot

to analyze the search for multiple marked vertices non-adjacent and show that
the probability of success is close to $1$. We also use the new value of $l$

show that the probability of success is directly proportional to the density of
marked vertices in the neighborhood. We also show that, in the case where

structures of large-scale solar eruptive activities, which inflict dramatic
impacts on the solar-terrestrial system. Previous studies have demonstrated
that varying magnetic properties of a coronal flux rope system could result in
a catastrophe of the rope, which may trigger solar eruptive activities. Since
the total mass of a flux rope also plays an important role in stabilizing the
rope, we use 2.5-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) numerical simulations in
this letter to investigate how a flux rope evolves as its total mass varies. It
is found that an unloading process that decreases the total mass of the rope
could result in an upward (eruptive) catastrophe in the flux rope system,
during which the rope jumps upward and the magnetic energy is released. This
indicates that mass unloading processes could initiate the eruption of the flux
rope. Moreover, when the system is not too diffusive, there is also a downward
(confined) catastrophe that could be caused by mass loading processes, via
which the total mass accumulates. The magnetic energy, however, is increased
during the downward catastrophe, indicating that mass loading processes could
cause confined activities that may contribute to the storage of energy before
the onset of coronal eruptions.

persistent memory. It has been rigorously proven that this algorithm will
aggregate one robot to another, but it remained open whether it would always
aggregate a system of $n > 2$ robots as was observed in experiments and
simulations. We prove that there exist deadlocked configurations from which
this algorithm cannot achieve aggregation for $n > 3$ robots when the robots'
motion is uniform and deterministic. On the positive side, we show that the
algorithm (i) is robust to small amounts of error, enabling deadlock avoidance,
and (ii) provably achieves a linear runtime speedup for the $n = 2$ case when
using a cone-of-sight sensor. Finally, we introduce a noisy, discrete
adaptation of this algorithm that is more amenable to rigorous analysis of
noise and whose simulation results align qualitatively with the original,
continuous algorithm.

of competition for TAI show firms face strong competitive pressure to deploy

significant portion of any eventual extremely large profits to good causes.
However, a key challenge for a Windfall Clause is that firms must have reason
to join one. Firms must also believe these commitments are credible. We extend
a model of TAI competition with a Windfall Clause to show how firms and
policymakers can design a Windfall Clause which overcomes these challenges.
Encouragingly, firms benefit from joining a Windfall Clause under a wide range
of scenarios. We also find that firms join the Windfall Clause more often when
the competition is more dangerous. Even when firms learn each other's
capabilities, firms rarely wish to withdraw their support for the Windfall
Clause. These three findings strengthen the case for using a Windfall Clause to
promote the safe development of TAI.

organizations, to collaboratively learn a shared model for prediction while
protecting local data privacy. However, most recent research and applications
of federated learning assume that all clients have fully labeled data, which is
impractical in real-world settings. In this work, we focus on a new scenario
for cross-silo federated learning, where data samples of each client are
partially labeled. We borrow ideas from semi-supervised learning methods where
a large amount of unlabeled data is utilized to improve the model's accuracy
despite limited access to labeled examples. We propose a new framework dubbed
SemiFed that unifies two dominant approaches for semi-supervised learning:
consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling. SemiFed first applies advanced
data augmentation techniques to enforce consistency regularization and then
generates pseudo-labels using the model's predictions during training. SemiFed
takes advantage of the federation so that for a given image, the pseudo-label
holds only if multiple models from different clients produce a high-confidence
prediction and agree on the same label. Extensive experiments on two image
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach under both homogeneous

requirement is often used to ensure that the execution of the concurrent
program can be serialized. Without synchronization requirement, a program
suffers from consistency violations. Recently, it was shown that if programs
are designed to tolerate such consistency violation faults (\cvf{s}) then one
can obtain substantial performance gain. Previous efforts to analyze the effect
of \cvf-tolerance are limited to run-time analysis of the program to determine
if tolerating \cvf{s} can improve the performance. Such run-time analysis is
very expensive and provides limited insight.
  In this work, we consider the question, `Can static analysis of the program
predict the benefit of \cvf-tolerance?' We find that the answer to this
question is affirmative. Specifically, we use static analysis to evaluate the
cost of a \cvf and demonstrate that it can be used to predict the benefit of
\cvf-tolerance. We also find that when faced with a large state space, partial
analysis of the state space (via sampling) also provides the required
information to predict the benefit of \cvf-tolerance. Furthermore, we observe
that the \cvf-cost distribution is exponential in nature, i.e., the probability
that a \cvf has a cost of $c$ is $A.B^{-c}$, where $A$ and $B$ are constants,
i.e., most \cvf{s} cause no/low perturbation whereas a small number of \cvf{s}
cause a large perturbation. This opens up new aveneus to evaluate the benefit
of \cvf-tolerance.

module takes advantage of two view feature maps from the same domain to
generate a disparity map, which is used to reconstruct the right view so as to
improve the confidence of the probability estimate of the right view. The
probability estimation module provides pixel-wise logistic mixture

outperforms the hand-crafted compression methods and the learning-based method

resistivity size effect due to steps on Ru thin films. The resistivity of two
different film orientations, $(0001)$ and $(1 \bar{1}00)$, is computed for
transport along a $[1 1 \bar{2} 0]$ direction both for smooth surfaces and for
surfaces with monolayer-high steps. In the case of smooth films, the systems
are also studied using solutions to the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE).
Interestingly, the resistivity of $(1 \bar{1}00)$ surfaces exhibits a
significant size effect even in the absence of surface steps. When
monolayer-high steps are spaced $\sim 10$ nm apart, the resistivity is shown to
increase due to scattering from the steps. However, only a small increase was
found which cannot explain the large effect seen in recent experiments with Ru
thin films. This highlights the need for further elucidation of the resistivity
size effect. Theoretical analysis suggest that films made from materials with a
relatively large ballistic conductance per area like Ru should exhibit a
reduced resistivity size effect. This result points to Ru as a promising
interconnect material. Finally, because a very efficient algorithm for
computing resistivity based on the kernel polynomial method (KPM) is used, the
approach fulfills a need for realistic models that can span length scales
directly relevant to experimental results. The calculations described here

showed a marked slowing down prior to glass formation, with increasing
activation energy, the slowdown in surface dynamics was relatively subtle. The
surface exhibited a lower glass transition temperature than the bulk, and the
dynamics preceding the transition were accurately described by a
temperature-independent activation energy. Surface dynamics were much faster
than bulk at a given temperature in the supercooled state, but surface and bulk
dynamics were found to be very similar when compared at their respective glass
transition temperatures. The manifestation of dynamical heterogeneity, as
characterized by the non-Gaussian parameter and breakdown of the

Individual atom motion was dominated by a cage and jump mechanism in the glassy

applications which rely on region-class semantics. Some document collections
contain densely laid out, highly irregular and overlapping multi-class region

approaches tend to be data intensive, cannot handle variable-sized images and
produce sub-optimal results for aforementioned images. To address these issues,
we propose BoundaryNet, a novel resizing-free approach for high-precision
semi-automatic layout annotation. The variable-sized user selected region of
interest is first processed by an attention-guided skip network. The network
optimization is guided via Fast Marching distance maps to obtain a good quality
initial boundary estimate and an associated feature representation. These
outputs are processed by a Residual Graph Convolution Network optimized using
Hausdorff loss to obtain the final region boundary. Results on a challenging
image manuscript dataset demonstrate that BoundaryNet outperforms strong
baselines and produces high-quality semantic region boundaries. Qualitatively,
our approach generalizes across multiple document image datasets containing
different script systems and layouts, all without additional fine-tuning. We
integrate BoundaryNet into a document annotation system and show that it
provides high annotation throughput compared to manual and fully automatic

revealed one after another. Although it provides a sub-linear regret bound,
such techniques completely ignore the importance of learning with fairness

Fairness-Aware Learning. This setting captures many classification problems for
which fairness is a concern. But it aims to attain zero-shot generalization
without any task-specific adaptation. This therefore limits the capability of a
model to adapt onto newly arrived data. To overcome such issues and bridge the
gap, in this paper for the first time we proposed a novel online meta-learning
algorithm, namely FFML, which is under the setting of unfairness prevention.
The key part of FFML is to learn good priors of an online fair classification
model's primal and dual parameters that are associated with the model's
accuracy and fairness, respectively. The problem is formulated in the form of a
bi-level convex-concave optimization. Theoretic analysis provides sub-linear
upper bounds for loss regret and for violation of cumulative fairness
constraints. Our experiments demonstrate the versatility of FFML by applying it
to classification on three real-world datasets and show substantial

Coulomb interactions, a 2-parametric correlated Hylleraas-type trial function
is used to calculate the ground state energy of the system in the domain $Z
\leq 10$. For odd $d=3,5$, the variational energy is given by a rational
algebraic function of the variational parameters whilst for even $d=2,4$ it is
shown for the first time that it corresponds to a more complicated
non-algebraic expression. This twofold analyticity will hold for any $d$. It
allows us to construct reasonably accurate approximate solutions for the ground
state energy $E_0(Z,d)$ in the form of compact analytical expressions. We call
them generalized Majorana solutions. They reproduce the first leading terms in
the celebrated $\frac{1}{Z}$ expansion, and serve as generating functions for
certain correlation-dependent properties. The (first) critical charge $Z_{\rm

within the present variational approach. In the light of these results, for the
physically important case $d=3$ a more general 3-parametric correlated

solution for a three-body Coulomb system with arbitrary charges and masses. It
admits a straightforward generalization to any $d$ as well. Concrete results

effective in alleviating the high demand for expensive annotations. Current
methods mainly focus on instance-wise comparisons to learn the global
discriminative features, however, pretermitting the local details to
distinguish tiny anatomical structures, lesions, and tissues. To address this
challenge, in this paper, we propose a general unsupervised representation
learning framework, named local discrimination (LD), to learn local
discriminative features for medical images by closely embedding semantically
similar pixels and identifying regions of similar structures across different
images. Specifically, this model is equipped with an embedding module for
pixel-wise embedding and a clustering module for generating segmentation. And
these two modules are unified through optimizing our novel region
discrimination loss function in a mutually beneficial mechanism, which enables
our model to reflect structure information as well as measure pixel-wise and
region-wise similarity. Furthermore, based on LD, we propose a center-sensitive
one-shot landmark localization algorithm and a shape-guided cross-modality
segmentation model to foster the generalizability of our model. When
transferred to downstream tasks, the learned representation by our method shows
a better generalization, outperforming representation from 18 state-of-the-art

significantly better performances. The source codes are publicly available at

  Emerging energy-related technologies deal with multiscale hierarchical
structures, intricate surface morphology, non-axisymmetric interfaces, and
complex contact lines where wetting is difficult to quantify with classical
methods. We hypothesis that a universal description of wetting on multiscale
surfaces can be developed by using integral geometry coupled to thermodynamic
laws. The proposed approach separates the different hierarchy levels of
physical description from the thermodynamic description, allowing for a
universal description of wetting on multiscale surfaces.
  Theory and Simulations
  The theoretical framework is presented followed by application to limiting
cases of various wetting states. The wetting states include those considered in
the Wenzel, Cassie-Baxter and wicking state models. The wetting behaviour of
multiscale surfaces is then explored by conducting direct simulations of a
fluid droplet on a structurally rough surface and a chemically heterogeneous
surface.
  Findings
  The underlying origin of the classical wetting models is shown to be rooted
within the proposed theoretical framework. In addition, integral geometry
provides a topological-based wetting metric that is not contingent on any type
of wetting state. Being of geometrical origin the wetting metric is applicable
to describe any type of wetting phenomena on complex surfaces. The proposed
framework is applicable to any complex fluid topology and multiscale surface.

diffraction pattern in slits experiments is seen as a consequence of zero
Minkowski momentum. Those findings are appealing for a better understanding of

model learning for performance improvement or on the visual explanation of a
trained diagnostic model. We propose a novel learn-explain-reinforce (LEAR)
framework that unifies diagnostic model learning, visual explanation generation
(explanation unit), and trained diagnostic model reinforcement (reinforcement
unit) guided by the visual explanation. For the visual explanation, we generate
a counterfactual map that transforms an input sample to be identified as an
intended target label. For example, a counterfactual map can localize
hypothetical abnormalities within a normal brain image that may cause it to be
diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We believe that the generated
counterfactual maps represent data-driven and model-induced knowledge about a
target task, i.e., AD diagnosis using structural MRI, which can be a vital
source of information to reinforce the generalization of the trained diagnostic
model. To this end, we devise an attention-based feature refinement module with
the guidance of the counterfactual maps. The explanation and reinforcement
units are reciprocal and can be operated iteratively. Our proposed approach was
validated via qualitative and quantitative analysis on the ADNI dataset. Its
comprehensibility and fidelity were demonstrated through ablation studies and
comparisons with existing methods.

black-box function optimization (BBFO) problems and implicitly constrained BBFO
problems. BBFO problems are known to be difficult because explicit
representations of objective functions are not available. Implicit constraints
make the problems more difficult because whether or not a solution is feasible
is revealed when the solution is evaluated with the objective function.
DX-NES-IC is one of the promising methods for implicitly constrained BBFO
problems. DX-NES-IC has shown better performance than conventional methods on
implicitly constrained benchmark problems. However, DX-NES-IC has a problem in
that the moving speed of the probability distribution is slow on ridge
structure. To address the problem, we propose the Fast Moving Natural Evolution
Strategy (FM-NES) that accelerates the movement of the probability distribution
on ridge structure by introducing the rank-one update into DX-NES-IC. The
rank-one update is utilized in CMA-ES. Since naively introducing the rank-one
update makes the search performance deteriorate on implicitly constrained
problems, we propose a condition of performing the rank-one update. We also
propose to reset the shape of the probability distribution when an infeasible
solution is sampled at the first time. In numerical experiments using
unconstrained and implicitly constrained benchmark problems, FM-NES showed
better performance than DX-NES-IC on problems with ridge structure and almost
the same performance as DX-NES-IC on the others. Furthermore, FM-NES
outperformed xNES, CMA-ES, xNES with the resampling technique, and CMA-ES with
the resampling technique.

a variety of reconfigurable approaches have been implemented to achieve color
change. However, it is still a challenge to enable a continuous color tuning
over the entire hue range in a simple, stable and rapid manner without changes
in configuration and material properties. Here, we demonstrate an all-optical
continuously tunable plasmonic pixel scheme via a modular design approach to
realize polarization-controlled full color tuning by breaking the intrinsic
symmetry of the unit cell layout. The polarization-controlled full color
tunable plasmonic pixels consist of three different types of color modules
oriented at an angle of 60{\deg} with respect to each other, corresponding to
three subtractive primary colors. Without changing the structural properties or
surrounding environment, the structural colors can be continuously and
precisely tuned across all hues by illuminating linearly polarized light with
different polarization directions. Meanwhile, the plasmonic pixels can be
flexibly customized for various color tuning processes, such as different
initial output colors and color tuning sequences, through the appropriate
choice of component modules and the elaborate design of module layouts.
Furthermore, we extend the color tuning to achromatic colors, white or black,
with the utilization of a single module or the introduction of a black module.
The proposed polarization-controlled full color tunable plasmonic pixels hold
considerable potential to function as next-generation color pixels integrated
with liquid-crystal polarizers.

beam itself to create images. The technique works by sending a low-intensity
beam of protons through the patient and measuring the position, direction, and
energy loss of each exiting proton. The pCT technique allows reconstruction of
the volumetric distribution of the relative stopping power (RSP) of the patient
tissues for use in treatment planning and pre-treatment range verification. We
have investigated new ways to make the reconstruction both efficient and
accurate. Better accuracy of RSP also enables more robust inverse approaches to
IMPT. For IMPT, we developed a framework for performing intensity-modulation of
the proton pencil beams. We expect that these developments will lead to
additional project work in the years to come, which requires a regular exchange

than 500,000 women annually, owing to the slow detection procedure. Early
diagnosis can help in treating and even curing cancer, but the tedious,
time-consuming testing process makes it impossible to conduct population-wise
screening. To aid the pathologists in efficient and reliable detection, in this
paper, we propose a fully automated computer-aided diagnosis tool for
classifying single-cell and slide images of cervical cancer. The main concern
in developing an automatic detection tool for biomedical image classification
is the low availability of publicly accessible data. Ensemble Learning is a
popular approach for image classification, but simplistic approaches that
leverage pre-determined weights to classifiers fail to perform satisfactorily.
In this research, we use the Sugeno Fuzzy Integral to ensemble the decision
scores from three popular pretrained deep learning models, namely, Inception
v3, DenseNet-161 and ResNet-34. The proposed Fuzzy fusion is capable of taking
into consideration the confidence scores of the classifiers for each sample,
and thus adaptively changing the importance given to each classifier, capturing
the complementary information supplied by each, thus leading to superior
classification performance. We evaluated the proposed method on three publicly
available datasets, the Mendeley Liquid Based Cytology (LBC) dataset, the
SIPaKMeD Whole Slide Image (WSI) dataset, and the SIPaKMeD Single Cell Image
(SCI) dataset, and the results thus yielded are promising. Analysis of the
approach using GradCAM-based visual representations and statistical tests, and
comparison of the method with existing and baseline models in literature

the energy functional is always unbounded on the product of $L^2$-spheres. We
show that under suitable conditions on $b_1$ and $b_2$, at least two normalized

Furthermore, by refining the upper bound of the ground state energy, we provide
a precise mass collapse behavior of the ground state and a precise limit
behavior of the excited state as $\beta\rightarrow 0$. Finally, we deal with
the high dimensional cases $N\geq 4$. Several non-existence results are

rotation of the extremely compact objects on the trapping of null geodesics was
treated in the simplest possible model of internal linearised
\mbox{Hartle--Thorne} spacetime with uniform energy density distribution and
uniform emissivity distribution of null geodesics. Here we extend the study of
the rotation influence on the trapping effect in the case of linearized
\mbox{Hartle--Thorne} spacetimes based on the Tolman VII spherically symmetric
solutions, where we assume the emissivity of the null geodesics proportional to
the energy density of the Tolman VII object having quadratic radial profile. We
demonstrate enhancement (suppression) of the trapping effect in the case of
counter-rotating (co-rotating) null geodesics due to the behavior of the
effective potentials and escape cones of the null geodesics in the linearised
Hartle--Thorne--Tolman VII spacetimes. In dependence on the parameters of these
spacetimes we determine the ""local"" and ""global"" coefficients of efficiency of
the trapping and compare the results to those related to the rotating
spacetimes based on the internal Schwarzschild spacetimes. We demonstrate that
in the Tolman VII spacetimes the trapping is more efficient, being allowed in
objects with radii larger than those of the trapping internal Schwarzschild

equal time second order correlation function g(2)(0), we find that the
unconventional photon blockade and the conventional photon blockade appear in
the atom-driven scheme, and they are both significantly affected by the
Rydberg-Rydberg interaction. We also find that under appropriate parameters,
the photon antibunching and the mean photon number can be significantly
enhanced by combining the conventional photon blockade and the unconventional
photon blockade. In the cavity-driven scheme, the existence of the
Rydberg-Rydberg interaction severely destroys the photon antibunching under the
unconventional photon blockade mechanism. These results will help to guide the
implementation of the single photon emitter in the Rydberg atoms-cavity system.

Here,
heavy quarks of a confining gauge theory produced by de Sitter fluctuations are
pushed apart by inflation and get confined after horizon re-entry. The large
amount of energy stored in the colour flux tubes connecting the quark pair
leads to black-hole formation. These are much lighter and can be of higher spin
than those produced by standard collapse of horizon-size inflationary
overdensities. Other difficulties exhibited by such mechanisms are also
avoided. Phenomenological features of the new mechanism are discussed as well
as accounting for both the entirety of the dark matter and the supermassive
black holes in the galactic centres. Under proper conditions, the mechanism can
be realised in a generic confinement theory, including ordinary QCD. We discuss
a possible string-theoretic realisation via $D$-branes. Interestingly, for
conservative values of the string scale, the produced gravity waves are within
the range of recent NANOGrav data. Simple generalisations of the mechanism
allow for the existence of a significant scalar component of gravity waves with
distinct observational signatures.

Among them, the most prevalent method is adversarial domain adaptation, which
can shorten the distance between the source domain and the target domain.
Although adversarial learning is very effective, it still leads to the
instability of the network and the drawbacks of confusing category information.
In this paper, we propose a Robust Ensembling Network (REN) for UDA, which
applies a robust time ensembling teacher network to learn global information
for domain transfer. Specifically, REN mainly includes a teacher network and a
student network, which performs standard domain adaptation training and updates
weights of the teacher network. In addition, we also propose a dual-network
conditional adversarial loss to improve the ability of the discriminator.
Finally, for the purpose of improving the basic ability of the student network,
we utilize the consistency constraint to balance the error between the student
network and the teacher network. Extensive experimental results on several UDA
datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model by comparing with
other state-of-the-art UDA algorithms.

resilience is currently predominantly measured in a way that quantifies the
quality of a system's response, for example the speed of its recovery. We
present a broadly applicable complementary measurement framework that
quantifies resilience similarly to basin stability by estimating a ""resilience
basin"" which represents the extent of adverse influences that the system can
recover from in a sufficient manner.
  As a proof of concept, the resilience measurement framework is applied to a
stochastic low-voltage DC power grid model which faces the unregulated rise of
decentralized energy supply by solar-powered prosumers. Two response options
are examined regarding their resilience effect and efficiency: Upgrading the
load capacity of existing power lines and installing batteries in the prosumer
households.
  The framework is able to show that line upgrades, while being more laborious
to execute, can provide potentially unlimited resilience against energy
decentralization. Household batteries, on the other hand, are simpler to
realize but also inherently limited in terms of their resilience benefit
(achieving only 70% of the resilience of line upgrades in our scenario). This
is explained by considering that they can only reduce fluctuations in the power
flows, but not the mean flow magnitude. Further, the framework can aid in
optimizing budget efficiency by pointing towards threshold budget values as
well as ideal strategies for the allocation of the line upgrades and for the
battery charging algorithm, respectively, which both happen to depend on the
budget size.

equation arising from the forced vibrations of a nonhomogeneous string and the
propagation of seismic waves in nonisotropic media. The variable coefficient
characterizes the inhomogeneity of media and its presence usually leads to the
destruction of the compactness of the inverse of linear wave operator with
periodic-Dirichlet boundary conditions on its range. In the pioneering work of
Barbu and Pavel (1997), it gives the existence and regularity of periodic
solution for Lipschitz, nonresonant and monotone nonlinearity under the
assumption $\eta_u>0$ (see Sect. 2 for its definition) on the coefficient
$u(x)$ and leaves the case $\eta_u=0$ as an open problem. In this paper, by
developing the invariant subspace method and using the complete reduction
technique and Leray-Schauder theory, we obtain the existence of periodic
solutions for such a problem when the nonlinear term satisfies the asymptotic
nonresonance conditions. Our result not only does not need any requirements on
the coefficient except for the natural positivity assumption (i.e., $u(x)>0$),
but also does not need the monotonicity assumption on the nonlinearity. In
particular, when the nonlinear term is an odd function and satisfies the global
nonresonance conditions, there is only one (trivial) solution to this problem
on the invariant subspace.

seeks to balance minimizing this cost and a movement cost associated with
changing decisions in-between rounds. We implement the algorithms in their most
general form, inviting future research on their performance in other
application areas. We evaluate the algorithms for the application of
right-sizing data centers using traces from Facebook, Microsoft, Alibaba, and
Los Alamos National Lab. Our experiments show that the online algorithms
perform close to the dynamic offline optimum in practice and promise a
significant cost reduction compared to a static provisioning of servers. We
discuss how features of the data center model and trace impact the performance.
Finally, we investigate the practical use of predictions to achieve further
cost reductions.

manipulators in a narrow workspace. Primarily, we propose the overall scheme of
iSAGO informed by the mixed momenta for an efficient constrained optimization
based on the penalty method. In the stochastic part, we generate the adaptive
stochastic momenta via the random selection of sub-functionals based on the
adaptive momentum (Adam) method to solve the body-obstacle stuck case. Due to
the slow convergence of the stochastic part, we integrate the accelerated
gradient descent (AGD) to improve the planning efficiency. Moreover, we adopt
the Bayesian tree inference (BTI) to transform the whole trajectory
optimization (SAGO) into an incremental sub-trajectory optimization (iSAGO),
which improves the computation efficiency and success rate further. Finally, we
tune the key parameters and benchmark iSAGO against the other 5 planners on
LBR-iiwa in a bookshelf and AUBO-i5 on a storage shelf. The result shows the
highest success rate and moderate solving efficiency of iSAGO.

platooning of constant time headway spacing policy with a varying-speed leader
using a multiple-predecessor-following strategy via vehicle-to-vehicle
communication. Unlike the common case in which the leader's speed is constant
and different kinds of Proportional-Integral-Derivative controllers are
implemented, in this case, the fact that the leader has a time-varying speed
necessitates the design of an observer. First, in order to estimate its
position, speed and acceleration error with respect to the leader, each
follower designs an observer. The observer is designed by means of constructing
an observer matrix whose parameters should be determined. We simplifies the
design of the matrix of the observer in such a way that the design boils down
to choosing a scalar value. The resulting observer turns out to have a third
order integrator dynamics, which provides an advantage of simplifying the
controller structure and, hence, derive conditions for string stability using a
frequency response method. A new heuristic searching algorithm is developed to
deduce the controller parameter conditions, given a fixed time headway, for
string stability. Additionally, a bisection-like algorithm is incorporated into
the above algorithm to obtain the minimum (with some deviation tolerance)
available value of the time headway by fixing one controller parameter. The
effectiveness of the internal and string stabilities of the proposed
observer-based controller is demonstrated via comparison examples.

of multiple-input multiple-output(MIMO) systems. A multi-antenna base station
(BS) and multiple single-antenna users are considered in these systems. A huge
portion of the system resources is dedicated as orthogonal pilots for accurate
channel estimation which imposes a huge training overhead. This overhead can be
highly mitigated by exploiting intrinsic angular domain sparsity of massive
MIMO channels and the sporadic traffic of users, i.e., few number of users are
active to sent or receive data in each coherence interval. In fact, the angles
of arrivals (AoAs) coming from active users are continuous parameters and can
take any arbitrary values. Besides, the AoAs corresponding to each active user
are alongside each other forming a specific cluster. This work revolves around
exploiting these features. Specifically, a blind clustering-based algorithm is
proposed that not only recovers the transmitted data by users in grant free
random access and primary pilots in random access blocks of coherent
transmission, but also provides accurate channel estimation. Our approach is
based on transforming the unknown variables into a higher dimensional space
with matrix variables. An off-grid atomic norm minimization is then proposed to
obtain the unknown matrix from only a few observed arrays at the BS. Then, a
clustering-based approach is employed to identify which AoAs correspond to
which active users. After identifying active users and their AoAs, an
alternating-based approach is performed to obtain the channels and data or
primary pilots of active users. Simulation results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in AoA detection as well as data recovery.

operations. The process of collecting data, however, may experience
irregularities, resulting in databases with missing data. Missing entries might
alter analysis efficiency and, consequently, the associated decision-making
process. This paper focuses on databases collecting information related to the
natural environment. Given the broad spectrum of recorded activities, these
databases typically are of mixed nature. It is therefore relevant to evaluate
the performance of missing data processing methods considering this
characteristic. In this paper we investigate the performances of several
missing data imputation methods and their application to the problem of missing
data in environment. A computational study was performed to compare the method
missForest (MF) with two other imputation methods, namely Multivariate
Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Tests
were made on 10 pretreated datasets of various types. Results revealed that MF
generally outperformed MICE and KNN in terms of imputation errors, with a more
pronounced performance gap for mixed typed databases where MF reduced the
imputation error up to 150%, when compared to the other methods. KNN was
usually the fastest method. MF was then successfully applied to a case study on
Quebec wastewater treatment plants performance monitoring. We believe that the
present study demonstrates the pertinence of using MF as imputation method when
dealing with missing environmental data.

minima generalize better, and that SGD discourages curvature. We offer a more
complete and nuanced view in support of both. First, we show that curvature
harms test performance through two new mechanisms, the shift-curvature and
bias-curvature, in addition to a known parameter-covariance mechanism. The
three curvature-mediated contributions to test performance are
reparametrization-invariant although curvature is not. The shift in the
shift-curvature is the line connecting train and test local minima, which
differ due to dataset sampling or distribution shift. Although the shift is
unknown at training time, the shift-curvature can still be mitigated by
minimizing overall curvature. Second, we derive a new, explicit SGD
steady-state distribution showing that SGD optimizes an effective potential
related to but different from train loss, and that SGD noise mediates a
trade-off between deep versus low-curvature regions of this effective
potential. Third, combining our test performance analysis with the SGD steady
state shows that for small SGD noise, the shift-curvature may be the most
significant of the three mechanisms. Our experiments confirm the impact of
shift-curvature on test loss, and further explore the relationship between SGD

XY (X=C, Si, Ge, Sn, Y=H, F, Cl), 2D hexagonal group V materials (blue

various graph structure related tasks such as node classification and graph
classification. However, GNNs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Existing
works mainly focus on attacking GNNs for node classification; nevertheless, the
attacks against GNNs for graph classification have not been well explored.
  In this work, we conduct a systematic study on adversarial attacks against
GNNs for graph classification via perturbing the graph structure. In
particular, we focus on the most challenging attack, i.e., hard label black-box
attack, where an attacker has no knowledge about the target GNN model and can
only obtain predicted labels through querying the target model.To achieve this
goal, we formulate our attack as an optimization problem, whose objective is to
minimize the number of edges to be perturbed in a graph while maintaining the
high attack success rate. The original optimization problem is intractable to
solve, and we relax the optimization problem to be a tractable one, which is
solved with theoretical convergence guarantee. We also design a coarse-grained
searching algorithm and a query-efficient gradient computation algorithm to
decrease the number of queries to the target GNN model. Our experimental
results on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our attack can
effectively attack representative GNNs for graph classification with less
queries and perturbations. We also evaluate the effectiveness of our attack
under two defenses: one is well-designed adversarial graph detector and the
other is that the target GNN model itself is equipped with a defense to prevent
adversarial graph generation. Our experimental results show that such defenses
are not effective enough, which highlights more advanced defenses.

CFL-one time-step. Curved interfaces between different materials are accurately

is maintained using high-order upwind dissipation designed for Maxwell's

biometric recognition systems, such as speaker recognition. SincNet, a deep
neural network architecture, gained popularity in speaker recognition tasks due
to its parameterized sinc functions that allow it to work directly on the
speech signal. The original SincNet architecture uses the softmax loss, which
may not be the most suitable choice for recognition-based tasks. Such loss
functions do not impose inter-class margins nor differentiate between easy and
hard training samples. Curriculum learning, particularly those leveraging
angular margin-based losses, has proven very successful in other biometric
applications such as face recognition. The advantage of such a curriculum
learning-based techniques is that it will impose inter-class margins as well as
taking to account easy and hard samples. In this paper, we propose Curricular
SincNet (CL-SincNet), an improved SincNet model where we use a curricular loss
function to train the SincNet architecture. The proposed model is evaluated on
multiple datasets using intra-dataset and inter-dataset evaluation protocols.
In both settings, the model performs competitively with other previously
published work. In the case of inter-dataset testing, it achieves the best
overall results with a reduction of 4\% error rate compare to SincNet and other
published work.

recent studies, equations of state for the quark-gluon plasma issued from the
lattice approach were adopted. The duration of the transition, an important
parameter affecting the amplitude of the gravitational wave spectrum, was
estimated self-consistently with the dynamics of the universe controlled by the
Einstein equations. The gravitational signal generated during the transition
peaks around 0,28 \mu Hz, being unable to explain the claimed NANOGrav signal.
However, the expected QCD gravitational wave background could be detected by
the planned spatial interferometer Big Bang Observer in its advanced version
for frequencies above 1.0 mHz. This possible detection assumes that algorithms
recently proposed will be able to disentangle the cosmological signal from that
expected for the astrophysical background generated by black hole binaries.

However, full-scale deep neural networks are often too resource-intensive in
terms of energy and storage. As a result, the bulk part of the machine learning
operation is therefore often carried out on an edge server, where the data is
compressed and transmitted. However, compressing data (such as images) leads to
transmitting information irrelevant to the supervised task. Another popular
approach is to split the deep network between the device and the server while
compressing intermediate features. To date, however, such split computing
strategies have barely outperformed the aforementioned naive data compression
baselines due to their inefficient approaches to feature compression. This
paper adopts ideas from knowledge distillation and neural image compression to
compress intermediate feature representations more efficiently. Our supervised
compression approach uses a teacher model and a student model with a stochastic
bottleneck and learnable prior for entropy coding (Entropic Student). We
compare our approach to various neural image and feature compression baselines

rate-distortion performance while maintaining smaller end-to-end latency. We
furthermore show that the learned feature representations can be tuned to serve

namely how the material stores the energy and how the entropy is produced. This
information is expressed in the form of the constitutive equations for two
scalars: the Helmholtz free energy and the entropy production. Additionally, we
follow the goal to determine the response of a mixture from a small (minimal)
set of material parameters, including shear viscosity, bulk viscosity and heat
conductivity associated with the mixture as a whole and the drag coefficient
connected with the interaction force between the constituents. The same
thermodynamic approach is used to obtain the model when the mixture as a whole
responses as an incompressible material. For both the compressible and

phased arrays to realize beamforming gain and overcome high path loss. However,
due to a limited number of simultaneous beams that can be created with
analog/hybrid phased antenna arrays, the overheads of beam training and beam
scheduling become a bottleneck for emerging networks that need to support a
large number of users and low latency applications. This paper introduces
rainbow-link, a novel multiple access protocol, that can achieve low latency
and massive connectivity by exploiting wide bandwidth at mmW frequencies and
novel analog true-time-delay array architecture with frequency dependent
beamforming capability. In the proposed design, the network infrastructure is
equipped with the true-time-delay array to simultaneously steer different
frequency resource blocks towards distinct directions covering the entire cell
sector. Users or devices, equipped with a narrowband receiver and either a
single antenna or small phased antenna array, connect to the network based on
their angular positions by selecting frequency resources within their rainbow
beam allocation. Rainbow-link is combined with a contention-based grant-free
access to eliminate the explicit beam training and user scheduling. The
proposed design and analysis show that rainbow-link grant-free access is a
potential candidate for latency-critical use cases within massive connectivity.
Our results show that, given less than 1e-5 probability of packet loss, a

processes became increasingly popular. Typically, the production hall is
equipped with satellites which receive position data of sensors that can be
pinned on components, load carriers or industrial trucks. This enables a
company e.g. to reduce search efforts and to optimize individual system
processes. In our research context, a sensor only sends position information
when it is moved. However, various circumstances frequently affect that data is
undesirably sent, e.g. due to disrupting factors nearby. This has a negative
impact on the data quality, the energy consumption, and the reliability of the
whole system. Motivated by this, we aim to distinguish between actual movements
and signals that were undesirably sent which is in particular challenging due
to the susceptibility of indoor systems in terms of noise and measuring errors.
Therefore, we propose two novel unsupervised classification algorithms suitable
for this task. Depending on the question of interest, they rely either on a
distance-based or on a time-based criterion, which allows to make use of all
essential information. Furthermore, we propose an approach to combine both
classifications and to aggregate them on spatial production areas. This enables
us to generate a comprehensive map of the underlying production hall with the
sole usage of the position data. Aside from the analysis and detection of the
underlying movement structure, the user benefits from a better understanding of
own system processes and from the detection of problematic system areas which
leads to a more efficient usage of positioning systems. Since all our
approaches are constructed with unsupervised techniques, they are handily
applicable in practice and do not require more information than the output data
