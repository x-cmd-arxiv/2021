with the charge density wave (CDW) order. Identifying the structure of the CDW
order is crucial for understanding the exotic normal state and
superconductivity in this system. Here, we report $^{51}$V nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) and $^{121/123}$Sb nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) studies
on kagome-metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. Below the CDW transition temperature
$T_\textrm{CDW} \sim$ 98 K, an abrupt change of spectra was observed,
indicating that the transition is of the first order. By further analysing the
spectra, we find that the CDW order is commensurate. And most remarkably, the
obtained experimental results suggest that the charge modulation of the CDW
order is of star-of-David pattern and accompanied by an additional charge
modulation in bulk below $T^* \sim$ 40 K. Our results revealing the
unconventional CDW order provide new insights into $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$.

smarter life. However, biased algorithms will negatively influence us. For
instance, groups targeted by biased algorithms will feel unfairly treated and
even fearful of negative consequences of these biases. This work targets biased
generative models' behaviors, identifying the cause of the biases and
eliminating them. We can (as expected) conclude that biased data causes biased
predictions of face frontalization models. Varying the proportions of male and
female faces in the training data can have a substantial effect on behavior on
the test data: we found that the seemingly obvious choice of 50:50 proportions
was not the best for this dataset to reduce biased behavior on female faces,
which was 71% unbiased as compared to our top unbiased rate of 84%. Failure in
generation and generating incorrect gender faces are two behaviors of these
models. In addition, only some layers in face frontalization models are
vulnerable to biased datasets. Optimizing the skip-connections of the generator
in face frontalization models can make models less biased. We conclude that it
is likely to be impossible to eliminate all training bias without an unlimited
size dataset, and our experiments show that the bias can be reduced and
quantified. We believe the next best to a perfect unbiased predictor is one
that has minimized the remaining known bias.

is sent to all the users, and one user can relay data to the other. In order to
provide enough power for the users, energy harvesting techniques have been
introduced with Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT)
coming to prominence in recent times. In this paper, analysis has been made
comparing two different power allocation schemes in NOMA, Fixed Power
allocation Scheme (FPS) and Dynamic Power allocation Scheme (DPS). The
comparisons were made in terms of their performance and characteristics while
undergoing SWIPT. It has been found that by using DPS, an almost 25% increase
in peak spectral efficiency can be obtained compared to FPS. However, DPS
suffers from a higher outage probability as the increase of power causes the
signal bandwidth to drop below the target rate a significant number of times.
Based on the detailed results, conclusions were drawn as to which power
allocation coefficient scheme would be used in real-time and non-real time
communication standards, respectively. The results suggest that for real-time
communication, FPS is more suitable while for non-real-time communication, DPS
appears to work better than FPS.

with unsupervised learning capabilities due to their biologically-inspired
computation. However, they may suffer from accuracy degradation if their
processing is performed under the presence of hardware-induced faults in
memories, which can come from manufacturing defects or voltage-induced
approximation errors. Since recent works still focus on the fault-modeling and
random fault injection in SNNs, the impact of memory faults in SNN hardware
architectures on accuracy and the respective fault-mitigation techniques are
not thoroughly explored. Toward this, we propose ReSpawn, a novel framework for
mitigating the negative impacts of faults in both the off-chip and on-chip
memories for resilient and energy-efficient SNNs. The key mechanisms of ReSpawn
are: (1) analyzing the fault tolerance of SNNs; and (2) improving the SNN fault
tolerance through (a) fault-aware mapping (FAM) in memories, and (b)
fault-aware training-and-mapping (FATM). If the training dataset is not fully
available, FAM is employed through efficient bit-shuffling techniques that
place the significant bits on the non-faulty memory cells and the insignificant
bits on the faulty ones, while minimizing the memory access energy. Meanwhile,
if the training dataset is fully available, FATM is employed by considering the
faulty memory cells in the data mapping and training processes. The
experimental results show that, compared to the baseline SNN without
fault-mitigation techniques, ReSpawn with a fault-aware mapping scheme improves
the accuracy by up to 70% for a network with 900 neurons without retraining.

the perspective of data-efficiency. Data-efficient RL has gone through three
major stages: pure on-line RL where every data-point is considered only once,
RL with a replay buffer where additional learning is done on a portion of the
experience, and finally transition memory based RL, where, conceptually, all
transitions are stored and re-used in every update step. While inferring
knowledge from all explicitly stored experience has lead to a tremendous gain
in data-efficiency, the question of how this data is collected has been vastly
understudied. We argue that data-efficiency can only be achieved through
careful consideration of both aspects. We propose to make this insight explicit
via a paradigm that we call 'Collect and Infer', which explicitly models RL as
two separate but interconnected processes, concerned with data collection and
knowledge inference respectively. We discuss implications of the paradigm, how
its ideas are reflected in the literature, and how it can guide future research

This development has spurred research in the area of automatic fact checking,
from approaches to detect check-worthy claims and determining the stance of
tweets towards claims, to methods to determine the veracity of claims given
evidence documents. These automatic methods are often content-based, using
natural language processing methods, which in turn utilise deep neural networks
to learn higher-order features from text in order to make predictions. As deep
neural networks are black-box models, their inner workings cannot be easily
explained. At the same time, it is desirable to explain how they arrive at
certain decisions, especially if they are to be used for decision making. While
this has been known for some time, the issues this raises have been exacerbated
by models increasing in size, and by EU legislation requiring models to be used
for decision making to provide explanations, and, very recently, by legislation
requiring online platforms operating in the EU to provide transparent reporting
on their services. Despite this, current solutions for explainability are still
lacking in the area of fact checking. This thesis presents my research on
automatic fact checking, including claim check-worthiness detection, stance
detection and veracity prediction. Its contributions go beyond fact checking,
with the thesis proposing more general machine learning solutions for natural
language processing in the area of learning with limited labelled data.
Finally, the thesis presents some first solutions for explainable fact
checking.

We prove that this iterated random-walk conditional sequential Monte Carlo

acceptance rates and expected squared jumping distance converge to non-trivial

equilibrium crystallization for active Brownian spheres. This effect appears to
be general for a wide class of active systems, including those driven by
deterministic time-dependent external fields, whose nonequilibrium patterns
ultimately disappear with increasing inertia. The path to this effective
equilibrium limit can be complex, with finite inertia sometimes acting to
accentuate nonequilibrium transitions. The restoration of near equilibrium
statistics can be understood through the conversion of active momentum sources
to passive-like stresses. Unlike truly equilibrium systems, the effective
temperature is now density dependent, the only remnant of the nonequilibrium
dynamics. This density-dependent temperature can in principle introduce
departures from equilibrium expectations, particularly in response to strong

direct grid search of the parameter space tends to be extremely time-consuming,
leading to the development of strategies balancing exploration of unknown
parameter spaces and exploitation towards required performance metrics.
However, classical Bayesian optimization strategies based on the Gaussian
process (GP) do not readily allow for the incorporation of the known physical

algorithm created by augmenting the standard GP with a structured probabilistic
model of the expected system's behavior. This approach balances the flexibility
of the non-parametric GP approach with a rigid structure of physical knowledge
encoded into the parametric model. The fully Bayesian treatment of the latter

the solution by successively including structure atoms into the estimated

cross-resolution face recognition approaches used simple, arbitrary, and
unrealistic down- and up-scaling techniques to measure robustness against
real-world edge-cases in image quality. Thus, we propose a new standardized

in the Wild (LFW). In contrast to previous derivatives, which focus on pose,
age, similarity, and adversarial attacks, our Cross-Quality Labeled Faces in
the Wild (XQLFW) maximizes the quality difference. It contains only more
realistic synthetically degraded images when necessary. Our proposed dataset is
then used to further investigate the influence of image quality on several
state-of-the-art approaches. With XQLFW, we show that these models perform
differently in cross-quality cases, and hence, the generalizing capability is
not accurately predicted by their performance on LFW. Additionally, we report
baseline accuracy with recent deep learning models explicitly trained for
cross-resolution applications and evaluate the susceptibility to image quality.
To encourage further research in cross-resolution face recognition and incite
the assessment of image quality robustness, we publish the database and code

an expansion of the Ni$_{0.33}$Co$_{0.67}$O lattice due to strain relaxation.
At low He+ fluence ($\leq$ 2$\times$10$^{14}$ ions cm$^{-2}$), the
redox-induced interfacial magnetic moment initially increases, owing to
enhanced oxygen migration. At higher fluence, the exchange bias is suppressed
due to reduction of pinned uncompensated interfacial Ni$_{0.33}$Co$_{0.67}$O
spins. For oxygen implanted samples, an initial lattice expansion below a dose
of 5$\times$10$^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ is subsequently dominated at higher dose by a
lattice contraction and phase segregation into NiO and CoO-rich phases, which
in turn alters the exchange bias. These results highlight the possibility of

While
possibly caused by a range of processes, detailed pattern analysis points at
close stellar flybys as cause for some of them. Surprisingly, these discs
reside in young low-mass clusters, where close stellar flybys are expected to
be rare. This fact motivated us to take a fresh look at the frequency of close
flybys in low-mass clusters. In the solar neighbourhood, low-mass clusters have
smaller half-mass radii than their more massive counterparts. We show that this
observational fact results in the mean and central stellar density of low-mass
clusters being approximately the same as in high-mass clusters, which is rarely
reflected in theoretical studies. We perform N-body simulations of the stellar
dynamics in young clusters obeying the observed mass-radius relation. Taking
the mean disc truncation radius as a proxy for the degree of influence of the
environment, we find that the influence of the environment on discs is more or
less the same in low- and high-mass clusters. Even the fraction of small
discs($<$ 10 au) is nearly identical. Our main conclusion is that the frequency
of close flybys seems to have been severely underestimated for low-mass
clusters. A testable prediction of this hypothesis is that low-mass clusters
should contain 10%-15% of discs smaller than 30 au truncated by flybys. These
truncated discs should be distinguishable from primordially small discs by
their steep outer edge.

Field Theory, which are respectively the T- and U-duality covariant
formulations of the supergravity limit of String Theory and M-theory. Extended
Field Theories do not live on spacetime, but on an extended spacetime, locally
modelled on the space underlying the fundamental representation of the duality
group. Despite its importance in M-theory, however, the global understanding of
Extended Field Theories is still an open problem. In this thesis we propose a
global geometric formulation of Extended Field Theory. Recall that ordinary
Kaluza-Klein theory unifies a metric with a gauge field on a principal bundle.
We propose a generalisation of the Kaluza-Klein principle which unifies a
metric and a higher gauge field on a principal infinity-bundle. This is
achieved by introducing an atlas for the principal infinity-bundle, whose local
charts can be naturally identified with the ones of Extended Field Theory.
Thus, DFT is interpreted as a higher Kaluza-Klein theory set on the total space
of a bundle gerbe underlying Kalb-Ramond field. As first application, we define
the higher Kaluza-Klein monopole by naturally generalising the ordinary
Gross-Perry monopole. Then we show that this monopole is exactly the NS5-brane
of String Theory. Secondly, we show that our higher geometric formulation gives
automatically rise to global abelian T-duality and global Poisson-Lie
T-duality. In particular, we globally recover the abelian T-fold and we define
the notion of Poisson-Lie T-fold. Crucially, we will investigate the global
geometric formulation of tensor hierarchies and gauged supergravity. In
particular, we will provide a global formulation of generalised Scherk-Schwarz
reductions and we will discuss their global non-geometric properties. Finally,
we explore the T-duality covariant geometric quantisation of DFT.

extensions of algebras, going beyond the Poincar\'e and Anti-de Sitter ones,
contain additional bosonic generators $Z_{ab}$ (Lorentz-like), and $U_a$
(translational-like) added to the standard Lorentz generator $J_{ab}$ and
translation generator $P_{a}$. Our analysis includes all cases up to two
fermionic supercharges, $Q_{\alpha}$ and $Y_{\alpha}$. The delivered plethora
of superalgebras includes few past results and offers a vastness of new
examples. The list of the cases is complete and contains all superalgebras up
to two of Lorentz-like, translation-like, and supercharge-like generators
$(JP+Q)+(ZU+Y)=JPZU+QY$. In the latter class, among $667$ founded
superalgebras, the $264$ are suitable for direct supergravity construction. For
each of them, one can construct a unique supergravity model defined by the
Lagrangian. As an example, we consider one of the algebra configurations and
provide its Lagrangian realization.

structural information for organic chemists but that has been largely ignored
by the ML community. Our technique requires no edited molecule pairs to train
and only a rough estimate of molecular properties, and it has the potential to
model long-range dependencies and symmetric molecular structures more easily
than graph-based methods. C5T5 also provides a powerful interface to domain
experts: it grants users fine-grained control over the generative process by
selecting and replacing IUPAC name fragments, which enables experts to leverage
their intuitions about structure-activity relationships. We demonstrate C5T5's
effectiveness on four physical properties relevant for drug discovery, showing
that it learns successful and chemically intuitive strategies for altering

the vehicles in the region to create a dynamic fog for rogue nodes detection.
We aim to reduce the data processing delays, overhead, and FPR in detecting
rogue nodes causing Sybil attacks at high vehicle densities. The performance of
our framework was carried out with simulations using OMNET++ and SUMO
simulators. Results show that our framework ensures 43% lower processing

extensive additive Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG). The assumption that the particle
production, the dynamical nonequilibrium process, is {\it priori} to be
analyzed by extensive BG or nonextensive Tsallis statistics, seems being a
failed path followed over the past decades. With generic (non)extensive
statistics, two equivalence classes $(c,d)$ belittle such an {\it ad hoc}
assumption. Accordingly, the statistical ensemble itself determines its degree
of (non)extensivity, including extensive BG and nonextensive Tsallis
statistics, which are characterized by $(1,1)$ and $(0,q)$, respectively. The
energy dependence of light-, $\gamma_q$, and strange-quark occupation factor,
$\gamma_s$, indicates that the produced particles are best described as a
nonequilibrium ensemble, where a remarkable nonmonotonic behavior associates
the $\mathrm{K}^+/\pi^+$ horn, for example. On other hand, the resulting
equivalence classes $(c,d)$ refer to a generic nonextensivity associated with
extended exponential and Lambert-$W_0$ exponentially generating distribution
function, which obviously emerge from free, short- and long-range correlations.
With this generic statistical approach, the hadron resonance gas model
excellently reproduces the $\mathrm{K}^+/\pi^+$ ratio, including its
nonmonotonic horn-like structure.

self-calibration observations for large scales, the application of sky
flat-fielding will enhance the sensitivity of the VIS detector at scales of

identified through asteroseismology of red giant stars using measurements of
the gravity mode period spacing together with the asteroseismic mass. For
mergers that occur after the formation of a degenerate core, remnant stars have
over-massive envelopes relative to their cores, which is manifested
asteroseismically by a g~mode period spacing smaller than expected for the
star's mass. Remnants of mergers which occur when the primary is still on the
main sequence or whose total mass is less than $\approx\! 2 \, M_\odot$ are
much harder to distinguish from single stars. Using the red giant asteroseismic
catalogs of Vrard et al. 2016 and Yu et al. 2018, we identify $24$ promising
candidates for merger remnant stars. In some cases, merger remnants could also
be detectable using only their temperature, luminosity, and asteroseismic mass,
a technique that could be applied to a larger population of red giants without
a reliable period spacing measurement.

fragmentation, where the former refers to fragmentation in the product state
basis. We explicitly construct the commutant algebra in several systems
exhibiting classical fragmentation, including the $t-J_z$ model and the spin-1
dipole-conserving model, and we illustrate the connection to previously-studied
""Statistically Localized Integrals of Motion"" (SLIOMs). We also revisit the
Temperley-Lieb spin chains, including the spin-1 biquadratic chain widely
studied in the literature, and show that they exhibit quantum Hilbert space
fragmentation. Finally, we study the contribution of the full commutant algebra
to the Mazur bounds in various cases. In fragmented systems, we use expressions
for the commutant to analytically obtain new or improved Mazur bounds for
autocorrelation functions of local operators that agree with previous numerical
results. In addition, we are able to rigorously show the localization of the
on-site spin operator in the spin-1 dipole-conserving model.

how this signal is enhanced by a short temporary kination era in the
cosmological history (less than 10 e-folds), that can arise at any energy scale
between a GeV and the inflationary scale $10^{16}$ GeV. We argue that such
kination era is naturally generated by a spinning axion before it gets trapped
by its potential. It is usually assumed that the axion starts oscillating
around its minimum from its initially frozen position. However, the early
dynamics of the Peccei-Quinn field can induce a large kinetic energy in the
axion field, triggering a kination era, either before or after the axion
acquires its mass, leading to a characteristic peak in the primordial
gravitational-wave background. This represents a smoking-gun signature of axion
physics as no other scalar field dynamics is expected to trigger such a
sequence of equations of state in the early universe. We derive the resulting
gravitational-wave spectrum, and present the parameter space that leads to such
a signal as well as the detectability prospects, in particular at LISA,
Einstein Telescope, Cosmic Explorer and Big Bang Observer. We show both

convenient critical points for renormalization group perturbative expansions,
allied with the usual difficulty in the convergence of numerical methods in

well-understood phase diagram of spin-1 chains and searching for signatures

determine that the hypothetical SU$(3)$ spin-2 phase is, in fact, dominated by

forced to move a large distance across the Brillouin zone and to braid, all

simplifying approximation (often called the Andreev approximation), which
assumes that excitations are fixed at the Fermi momentum and only Andreev
reflections, with no normal reflections, occur at interfaces. While this
approximation is appropriate for superconductors with high carrier density (for
which the chemical potential vastly exceeds the pairing gap), it breaks down
for low-carrier-density superconductors, such as topological superconductors,
doped semiconductors, or superfluid quantum gases. Here, we present a general
$analytical$ framework for transport in superconducting junctions that does not
rely on this limiting Andreev approximation. We apply our framework to describe
transport in junctions between $s$-wave superconductors along the BCS-BEC
crossover, which interpolates between the conventional high-carrier-density
(BCS-)regime and moderate- as well as low-carrier-density regimes (unitary and
BEC regimes), for which the Andreev approximation is not valid. As the system
is tuned from the BCS to the BEC regime, the magnitude of a subgap current due
to multiple Andreev reflections (MAR) decreases. However, nonlinearities in the
current-voltage characteristic become more pronounced near the intermediate
unitary limit, giving rise to sharp peaks and dips in the differential
conductance with even $negative$ differential conductance at specific voltages.
Microscopically, the negative differential conductance is related to the van
Hove points in the band structures, at which enhanced normal reflection occurs
and that become accessible only when the chemical potential is comparable to or
smaller than the pairing gap. The subgap current due to MAR vanishes at a
critical interaction strength on the BEC side, which we identify as the
splitting point where the particle dispersion changes curvature.

complexity of PGW for various cosmological models, such as de Sitter,

we have also computed Von-Neumann entanglement entropy. By making the
comparison of complexity with entanglement entropy, we are able to probe
various features regarding the dynamics of evolution for different cosmological
models. Because entanglement entropy is independent of the squeezing angle, we
are able to understand more details of the system using Nielsen's measure of
complexity which is dependent on both squeezing parameter and angle. This
implies that quantum complexity could indeed be a useful probe to study quantum
features in cosmological scale. Quantum complexity is also becoming a powerful
technique to understand the chaotic behaviour and random fluctuations of
quantum fields. Using the growth of complexity, we are able to compute quantum
Lyapunov exponent for various cosmological models and comment on it's chaotic

have been introduced for the task of image super-resolution (SR), using several
convolutional layers and numerous filters. These methods have taken over the
benchmarks of image quality for upscaling tasks. Would it be possible to
replace classic upscalers with deep learning architectures on edge devices such
as display panels, tablets, laptop computers, etc.? On one hand, the current
trend in Edge-AI chips shows a promising future in this direction, with rapid
development of hardware that can run deep-learning tasks efficiently. On the
other hand, in image SR only few architectures have pushed the limit to extreme
small sizes that can actually run on edge devices at real-time. We explore
possible solutions to this problem with the aim to fill the gap between classic
upscalers and small deep learning configurations. As a transition from classic
to deep-learning upscaling we propose edge-SR (eSR), a set of one-layer
architectures that use interpretable mechanisms to upscale images. Certainly, a
one-layer architecture cannot reach the quality of deep learning systems.
Nevertheless, we find that for high speed requirements, eSR becomes better at
trading-off image quality and runtime performance. Filling the gap between

massive adoption of this technology. It is equally important to have an
interpretable system that can reveal the inner strategies to solve this problem

sound in the moir\'e superlattice. Specifically, the phason modes become
overdamped at low energies and acquire a finite gap, which displays a universal

manifested not only in the non-interacting electronic structure of moir\'e

lack explanations of their predictions for given instances. In this work, we
bring together these two perspectives of transparency into a holistic
explanation framework for explaining BNNs. Within the Bayesian framework, the
network weights follow a probability distribution. Hence, the standard
(deterministic) prediction strategy of DNNs extends in BNNs to a predictive
distribution, and thus the standard explanation extends to an explanation
distribution. Exploiting this view, we uncover that BNNs implicitly employ
multiple heterogeneous prediction strategies. While some of these are inherited
from standard DNNs, others are revealed to us by considering the inherent

unprecedented size, providing observations of more than a billion objects
distributed over a third of the full sky. Approximately 20 million of these
galaxies will have their spectroscopy available, allowing us to map the 3D
large-scale structure of the Universe in great detail. This paper investigates
prospects for the detection of cosmic voids therein and the unique benefit they
provide for cosmology. In particular, we study the imprints of dynamic and
geometric distortions of average void shapes and their constraining power on
the growth of structure and cosmological distance ratios. To this end, we made
use of the Flagship mock catalog, a state-of-the-art simulation of the data
expected to be observed with Euclid. We arranged the data into four adjacent
redshift bins, each of which contains about 11000 voids and estimated the
stacked void-galaxy cross-correlation function in every bin. Fitting a
linear-theory model to the data, we obtained constraints on $f/b$ and $D_M H$,
where $f$ is the linear growth rate of density fluctuations, $b$ the galaxy
bias, $D_M$ the comoving angular diameter distance, and $H$ the Hubble rate. In
addition, we marginalized over two nuisance parameters included in our model to
account for unknown systematic effects. With this approach, Euclid will be able
to reach a relative precision of about 4% on measurements of $f/b$ and 0.5% on
$D_M H$ in each redshift bin. Better modeling or calibration of the nuisance
parameters may further increase this precision to 1% and 0.4%, respectively.
Our results show that the exploitation of cosmic voids in Euclid will provide
competitive constraints on cosmology even as a stand-alone probe. For example,
the equation-of-state parameter $w$ for dark energy will be measured with a
precision of about 10%, consistent with previous more approximate forecasts.

find both shear-thinning and shear-thickening effects, depending on the
capillary number. We apply our model to the existing community code for lava

formation in the protosolar nebula, from the condensation of pure ices to the
crystallization of mixtures of pure condensates and clathrates in various

our formulation allows to deal with two important challenges of face-centric

there are different facial concepts that simultaneously occur in the same
region of the image, like ""nose"" (facial part) and ""pointy nose"" (facial
attribute); and (2) global concepts: there are units with affinity to concepts
that do not refer to specific locations of the face (e.g. apparent age). We use
Hierarchical Network Dissection to dissect different face-centric inference
models trained on widely-used facial datasets. The results show models trained
for different tasks learned different internal representations. Furthermore,
the interpretability results can reveal some biases in the training data and
some interesting characteristics of the face-centric inference tasks. Finally,
we conduct controlled experiments on biased data to showcase the potential of

rotators and the rate of lithium depletion is very sensitive to the changes in
the stellar structure. Additionally, observations show a correlation between
slow rotation and lithium depletion, contrary to expectations from standard
models of rotationally driven mixing. By suppressing convection, and therefore
decreasing the temperature at the base of the convective envelope, lithium
burning is strongly quenched in our rapidly rotating models to an extent
sufficient to account for the lithium spread observed in young open clusters.

phenomenology on cosmological scales while simultaneously possessing a
screening mechanism, allowing it to avoid solar system constraints. Such models
result in non-linear field equations, which can be solved analytically only in
simple highly symmetric systems. In this work we study the equation of motion
of a scalar-tensor theory with chameleon screening using the finite element
method. More specifically, we solve the field equation for spherical and
triaxial NFW cluster-sized halos. This allows a detailed investigation of the
relationship between the NFW concentration and the virial mass parameters and
the magnitude of the chameleon acceleration, as measured at the virial radius.
In addition, we investigate the effects on the chameleon acceleration due to
halo triaxiality. We focus on the parameter space regions that are still
allowed by the observational constraints. We find that given our dataset, the
largest allowed value for the chameleon-to-NFW acceleration ratio at the virial
radius is $\sim 10^{-7}$. This result strongly indicates that the chameleon
models that are still allowed by the observational constraints would not lead
to any measurable effects on galaxy cluster scales. Nonetheless, we also find
that there is a direct relationship between the NFW potential and the
chameleon-to-NFW acceleration ratio at the virial radius. Similarly, there is a
direct (yet a much more complicated) relationship between the NFW
concentration, the virial mass and the acceleration ratios at the virial
radius. Finally, we find that triaxiality introduces extra directional effects
on the acceleration measurements. These effects in combination could
potentially be used in future observational searches for fifth forces.

distant metastasis and what clinicopathological factors are associated with
such a risk? In this paper, we propose a ranking based censoring-aware machine
learning model for answering such questions. The proposed model is able to
generate an interpretable formula for risk stratifi-cation using a minimal
number of clinicopathological covariates through L1-regulrization. Using this
approach, we analyze the association of time to distant metastasis (TTDM) with
various clinical parameters for early stage, luminal (ER+ or HER2-) breast

The TTDM risk stratification formula obtained using the proposed approach is
primarily based on mitotic score, histolog-ical tumor type and lymphovascular
invasion. These findings corroborate with the known role of these covariates in
increased risk for distant metastasis. Our analysis shows that the proposed
risk stratification formula can discriminate between cases with high and low
risk of distant metastasis (p-value < 0.005) and can also rank cases based on
their time to distant metastasis with a concordance-index of 0.73.

convergence of the particles. Similar to the case of homogeneous, isotropic
turbulence, the cluster formation is present at large volumes, while cluster
destruction is prominent at small volumes and these effects are amplified with
Stokes number. However, unlike homogeneous, isotropic turbulence, formation of
large number of very small volumes was observed at all Stokes numbers and is
attributed to the collision of particles with the pore wall. Multiscale wavelet
analysis of the particle number density showed peak of clustering shifts

high-Tc superconductors is proposed, based on the picture of Euclidean Q-balls

Unlike the baryonic Q-balls in supersymmetric standard model, the Euclidean
Q-balls describe spin-/charge densities, that oscillate in Matsubara time, and
are found in the 'nested' repulsive Hubbard model of high-Tc superconductors.
Euclidean Q-balls arise due to global invariance of the effective theory under
the phase rotation of the Fourier amplitudes of spin-/charge fluctuations,
leading to conservation of the 'Noether charge' Q in Matsubara time. Due to
local minimum of their potential energy at finite amplitude of the density
fluctuations, the Q-balls provide greater binding energy of fermions into
local/Cooper pairs than an exchange with infinitesimal lattice/charge/spin
quasiparticles in the usual Frohlich mechanism. We show that below some
temperature T* the Q-balls arise with a finite density of superconducting
condensate inside them. The Q-balls expand their sizes to infinity at
superconducting transition temperature Tc. Fermionic spectral gap inside the
Q-balls arises in the vicinity of the 'nested' regions of the bare Fermi
surface. Solutions are found analytically from the Eliashberg like equations
with the 'nesting' wave vectors connecting different 'hot spots' on the bare
Fermi surface. The experimental dependences of Uemura (1989) of Tc on
superconducting density n_s, as well as of Li et al. (2010) of diamagnetic
moment on magnetic field above Tc in cuprates follow naturally from the
proposed theory. The 'breathing modes' of the Q-balls in Matsubara time, as

handle severe occlusions, different reconstruction granularities from body to

total motion capture system for multi-person interactive scenarios using only
sparse multi-view cameras. By contributing a novel hand and face bootstrapping
algorithm, our method is capable of efficient localization and accurate
association of the hands and faces even on severe occluded occasions. We
leverage both pose regression and keypoints detection methods and further
propose a unified two-stage parametric fitting method for achieving
pixel-aligned accuracy. Moreover, for extremely self-occluded poses and close
interactions, a novel feedback mechanism is proposed to propagate the
pixel-aligned reconstructions into the next frame for more accurate
association. Overall, we propose the first light-weight total capture system
and achieves fast, robust and accurate multi-person total motion capture
performance. The results and experiments show that our method achieves more
accurate results than existing methods under sparse-view setups.

The challenges of low-energy electron transport in cases of low field are
discussed, such as the growth of the cyclotron radius with decreasing magnetic
field, which puts a ceiling on filter performance relative to fixed filter
dimensions. Additionally, low pitch angle trajectories are dominated by motion
parallel to the magnetic field lines and introduce non-adiabatic conditions and
curvature drift. To minimize these effects and maximize electron acceptance
into the filter, we present a three-potential-well design to simultaneously
drain the parallel and transverse kinetic energies throughout the length of the

electron transport from a 1 T iron core (or 3 T superconducting) starting field

and thus require a suitable definition of entanglement. We find that the
entanglement of the ground state is strongly conditioned by those
one-dimensional space features. We also find that in the strongly attractive
regime the relative ground state is a highly localized state leading to maximum
entanglement. Our analysis shows that in the strongly repulsive regime the
ground state changes smoothly from a superposition of Slater-like states to a
finite superposition of Slaters, this lack of accessible states yields to Pauli
blocking as a strong signature of fermionization. Our results indicate that
entangled states could be obtained in current experiments by reaching the
non-interacting regime from the interacting regime. Entangled states could also
be obtained when a state is brought from the interacting regime into the
strongly repulsive regime by changing the scattering length near the
confinement-induced resonance. Finally, we show that the first excited state

the proposed scheme consists of two new aspects, i.e., selection of a tailored
multiple access mode for each UE while considering the UE-specific radio
resource utilization cost; and multi-dimensional radio resource allocation
among coexisting UEs under dynamic network conditions. To reduce the
UE-specific resource utilization cost, the base station (BS) organizes UEs with
disparate multi-domain resource constraints as UE coalition by considering each
UE's specific resource availability, perceived quality, and utilization
capability. Each UE within a coalition could utilize its preferred radio
resources, which leads to low utilization cost while avoiding resource-sharing
conflicts with remaining UEs. Furthermore, to meet UE-specific QoS requirements
and varying resource conditions at the UE side, the multi-dimensional radio
resource allocation among coexisting UEs is formulated as an optimization
problem to maximize the summation of cost-aware utility functions of all UEs. A
solution to solve this NP-hard problem with low complexity is developed using
the successive convex approximation and the Lagrange dual decomposition

of similar (or given) orders is a classical problem that has been intensively
investigated since late seventies. Given a connected graph $G=(V,E)$ and a
weight function $w : V \to \mathbb{Q}_\geq$, a connected $k$-partition of $G$
is a partition of $V$ such that each class induces a connected subgraph. The
balanced connected $k$-partition problem consists in finding a connected
$k$-partition in which every class has roughly the same weight. To model this
concept of balance, one may seek connected $k$-partitions that either maximize
the weight of a lightest class $(\text{max-min BCP}_k)$ or minimize the weight
of a heaviest class $(\text{min-max BCP}_k)$. Such problems are equivalent when
$k=2$, but they are different when $k\geq 3$. In this work, we propose a simple
pseudo-polynomial $\frac{k}{2}$-approximation algorithm for $\text{min-max
BCP}_k$ which runs in time $\mathcal{O}(W|V||E|)$, where $W = \sum_{v \in V}
w(v)$. Based on this algorithm and using a scaling technique, we design a

LEarning human MOtion priors for 4D human body capture. By leveraging the
large-scale motion capture dataset AMASS, we introduce a novel motion
smoothness prior, which strongly reduces the jitters exhibited by poses
recovered over a sequence. Furthermore, to handle contacts and occlusions
occurring frequently in body-scene interactions, we design a contact friction
term and a contact-aware motion infiller obtained via per-instance
self-supervised training. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed motion

reconstructing smooth motions and physically plausible body-scene interactions.

by comparing data and models. The credible intervals placed on model parameters
are often as important as the maximum a posteriori probability values, as the
intervals indicate concordance or discordance between models and with
measurements from other data. Intermediate statistics (e.g. the power spectrum)
are usually measured and inferences made by fitting models to these rather than
the raw data, assuming that the likelihood for these statistics has
multivariate Gaussian form. The covariance matrix used to calculate the
likelihood is often estimated from simulations, such that it is itself a random
variable. This is a standard problem in Bayesian statistics, which requires a
prior to be placed on the true model parameters and covariance matrix,
influencing the joint posterior distribution. As an alternative to the
commonly-used Independence-Jeffreys prior, we introduce a prior that leads to a
posterior that has approximately frequentist matching coverage. This is
achieved by matching the covariance of the posterior to that of the
distribution of true values of the parameters around the maximum likelihood
values in repeated trials, under certain assumptions. Using this prior,
credible intervals derived from a Bayesian analysis can be interpreted
approximately as confidence intervals, containing the truth a certain
proportion of the time for repeated trials. Linking frequentist and Bayesian
approaches that have previously appeared in the astronomical literature, this
offers a consistent and conservative approach for credible intervals quoted on
model parameters for problems where the covariance matrix is itself an

squared sum of various $3$-uniform hypergraphs using various proof techniques.
Some of our proofs rely on the flag algebra method while others use more

an in-depth look at this rubble-pile near-Earth asteroid. In particular, the
measured gravity field and the detailed shape model of Bennu indicate
significant heterogeneities in its interior structure, compatible with a lower
density at its center. Here we combine gravity inversion methods with a
statistical rubble-pile model to determine the density and size-frequency
distribution (SFD) index of the rubble that constitutes Bennu. The best-fitting
models indicate that the SFD of the interior is consistent with that observed
on the surface, with a cumulative SFD index of approximately $-2.9$. The rubble
bulk density is approximately $1.35$ g/cm$^3$, corresponding to a $12$%
macro-porosity. We find the largest rubble particle to be approximately $145$
m, whereas the largest void is approximately $10$ m.

In particular, the early exercise features with the asset option and option
sensitivity are computed based on a coupled of nonlinear PDEs with fixed
boundaries for which a high order analytical approximation is obtained.
Furthermore, we implement a new treatment at the left boundary by introducing a
third-order Robin boundary condition. Rather than computing the optimal
exercise boundary from the analytical approximation, we simply obtain it from
the asset option based on the linear relationship at the left boundary. As
such, a high order convergence rate can be achieved. We validate by examples
that the improvement at the left boundary yields a fourth-order convergence
rate without further implementation of mesh refinement, Rannacher
time-stepping, and/or smoothing of the initial condition. Furthermore, we
extensively compare, the performance of our present method with several 5(4)
Runge-Kutta pairs and observe that Dormand and Prince and Bogacki and Shampine

emerge naturally from generic analytical growth rules in a distributed

different locales, and {\bf (ii)} stochasticity in the growth rate, also known
as ""seascape noise."" The latter leads to a wide (power-law) distribution in

without relying on manual labeling. Recently, a number of SSL methods for graph
representation learning have achieved performance comparable to SOTA
semi-supervised GNNs. A Siamese network, which relies on data augmentation, is
the popular architecture used in these methods. However, these methods rely on
heuristically crafted data augmentation techniques. Furthermore, they use
either contrastive terms or other tricks (e.g., asymmetry) to avoid trivial
solutions that can occur in Siamese networks. In this study, we propose,
GraphSurgeon, a novel SSL method for GNNs with the following features. First,
instead of heuristics we propose a learnable data augmentation method that is
jointly learned with the embeddings by leveraging the inherent signal encoded
in the graph. In addition, we take advantage of the flexibility of the
learnable data augmentation and introduce a new strategy that augments in the
embedding space, called post augmentation. This strategy has a significantly
lower memory overhead and run-time cost. Second, as it is difficult to sample
truly contrastive terms, we avoid explicit negative sampling. Third, instead of
relying on engineering tricks, we use a scalable constrained optimization
objective motivated by Laplacian Eigenmaps to avoid trivial solutions. To
validate the practical use of GraphSurgeon, we perform empirical evaluation
using 14 public datasets across a number of domains and ranging from small to
large scale graphs with hundreds of millions of edges. Our finding shows that
GraphSurgeon is comparable to six SOTA semi-supervised and on par with five
SOTA self-supervised baselines in node classification tasks. The source code is

question: given specific restrictions on a set of samplers, what kind of signal
can be uniquely represented by the corresponding samples attained, as the
foundation of sparse sensing. It is different from compressed sensing, which
exploits the sparse representation of a signal to reduce sample complexity
(compressed sampling or acquisition). We use sparse sensing to denote a board
concept of methods whose main focus is to improve the efficiency and cost of
sampling implementation itself. The ""sparse"" here is referred to sampling at a
low temporal or spatial rate (sparsity constrained sampling or acquisition),
which in practice models cheaper hardware such as lower power, less memory and
throughput.
  We take frequency and direction of arrival (DoA) estimation as concrete
examples and give the necessary and sufficient requirements of the sampling
strategy. Interestingly, we prove that these problems can be reduced to some
(multiple) remainder model. As a straightforward corollary, we supplement and
complete the theory of co-prime sampling, which receives considerable attention
over last decade.
  On the other hand, we advance the understanding of the robust multiple
remainder problem, which models the case when sampling with noise. A sharpened
tradeoff between the parameter dynamic range and the error bound is derived. We
prove that, for N-frequency estimation in either complex or real waveforms,
once the least common multiple (lcm) of the sampling rates selected is
sufficiently large, one may approach an error tolerance bound independent of N.

Diophantine equation theory and higher-order sparse ruler to strengthen the
sampling time, the degree of freedom (DoF), and the sampling sparsity,
simultaneously. Resorting to higher-moment statistics, the proposed Diophantine
framework presents two fundamental improvements. First, on frequency
estimation, we prove that given arbitrarily large down-sampling rates, there
exist sampling schemes where the number of samples needed is only proportional
to the sum of DoF and the number of snapshots required, which implies a linear
sampling time. Second, on Direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation, we propose two
generic array constructions such that given N sensors, the minimal distance
between sensors can be as large as a polynomial of N, O(N^q), which indicates
that an arbitrarily sparse array (with arbitrarily small mutual coupling)
exists given sufficiently many sensors. In addition, asymptotically, the
proposed array configurations produce the best known DoF bound compared to
existing sparse array designs.

simplify expressions or prove equivalences. Developing rewrite rules can be
difficult: rules may be subtly incorrect, profitable rules are easy to miss,
and rulesets must be rechecked or extended whenever semantics are tweaked.
Large rulesets can also be challenging to apply: redundant rules slow down
rule-based search and frustrate debugging. This paper explores how equality
saturation, a promising technique that uses e-graphs to apply rewrite rules,
can also be used to infer rewrite rules. E-graphs can compactly represent the
exponentially large sets of enumerated terms and potential rewrite rules. We
show that equality saturation efficiently shrinks both sets, leading to faster
synthesis of smaller, more general rulesets.
  We prototyped these strategies in a tool dubbed ruler. Compared to a similar
tool built on CVC4, ruler synthesizes 5.8X smaller rulesets 25X faster without
compromising on proving power. In an end-to-end case study, we show
ruler-synthesized rules which perform as well as those crafted by domain
experts, and addressed a longstanding issue in a popular open source tool.

the alignment mechanism proposed in RAD-TTS as a generic alignment learning

combines forward-sum algorithm, the Viterbi algorithm, and a simple and
efficient static prior. In our experiments, the alignment learning framework
improves all tested TTS architectures, both autoregressive (Flowtron, Tacotron

improves alignment convergence speed of existing attention-based mechanisms,
simplifies the training pipeline, and makes the models more robust to errors on

attenuation and realistic observational effects (aperture effects and noise).
We compare the simulated $D_n4000$ and EW(H$\delta$) of galaxies with $10.5
\leq \log(M_\ast/M_\odot) \leq 11.5$ at $0.6 \leq z \leq 1.0$ to the observed
distributions from the LEGA-C survey. TNG100 globally reproduces the observed
distributions of spectral indices, implying that the age distribution of
galaxies in TNG100 is generally realistic. Yet there are small but significant
differences. For old galaxies, TNG100 shows small $D_n4000$ when compared to
LEGA-C, while LEGA-C galaxies have larger EW(H$\delta$) at fixed $D_n4000$.
There are several possible explanations: 1) LEGA-C galaxies have overall older
ages combined with small contributions (a few percent in mass) from younger
($<1$~Gyr) stars, while TNG100 galaxies may not have such young
sub-populations; 2) the spectral mismatch could be due to systematic
uncertainties in the stellar population models used to convert stellar ages and
metallicities to observables. In conclusion, the latest cosmological galaxy
formation simulations broadly reproduce the global age distribution of galaxies
at $z\sim1$ and, at the same time, the high quality of the latest observed and

By annotating and categorizing over 700 cues, we found that the most common cue
modalities were conversation turn timing and verbal content. Conversation turn
timing cues occurred more frequently overall, whereas verbal content cues

honeycomb lattice. Remarkably, this honeycomb code assembles weight-six parity
checks using only two-local measurements. The sparse connectivity and two-local
measurements are desirable features for certain hardware, while the weight-six
parity checks enable robust performance in the circuit model.
  In this work, we quantify the robustness of logical qubits preserved by the
honeycomb code using a correlated minimum-weight perfect-matching decoder.
Using Monte Carlo sampling, we estimate the honeycomb code's threshold in
different error models, and project how efficiently it can reach the ""teraquop
regime"" where trillions of quantum logical operations can be executed reliably.
We perform the same estimates for the rotated surface code, and find a
threshold of $0.2\%-0.3\%$ for the honeycomb code compared to a threshold of
$0.5\%-0.7\%$ for the surface code in a controlled-not circuit model. In a
circuit model with native two-body measurements, the honeycomb code achieves a
threshold of $1.5\% < p <2.0\%$, where $p$ is the collective error rate of the
two-body measurement gate - including both measurement and correlated data
depolarization error processes. With such gates at a physical error rate of
$10^{-3}$, we project that the honeycomb code can reach the teraquop regime
with only $600$ physical qubits.

perform efficient biased all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. The reaction

relative free energies for different polymorphs. This includes accurate
prediction of the approximate pressure at which urea undergoes a phase
transition and one of the metastable polymorphs becomes the most stable

assuming that $\kappa \frac{\xi '}{\xi''}\ll 1$, which is motivated by
slow-roll arguments, we succeed in providing much more simpler expressions for
the slow-roll indices and for the tensor and scalar spectral indices and for
the tensor-to-scalar ratio. We exemplify our refined theoretical framework by
using an illustrative example with a simple power-law scalar coupling function
$\xi(\phi)\sim \phi^{\nu}$ and as we demonstrate the resulting inflationary

to effectively schedule jobs. State-of-the-art online cluster job schedulers
use history-based learning, which uses past job execution information to
estimate the runtime properties of newly arrived jobs. However, with fast-paced
development in cluster technology (in both hardware and software) and changing
user inputs, job runtime properties can change over time, which lead to
inaccurate predictions. In this paper, we explore the potential and limitation
of real-time learning of job runtime properties, by proactively sampling and
scheduling a small fraction of the tasks of each job. Such a
task-sampling-based approach exploits the similarity among runtime properties
of the tasks of the same job and is inherently immune to changing job behavior.
Our study focuses on two key questions in comparing task-sampling-based
learning (learning in space) and history-based learning (learning in time): (1)
Can learning in space be more accurate than learning in time? (2) If so, can
delaying scheduling the remaining tasks of a job till the completion of sampled
tasks be more than compensated by the improved accuracy and result in improved
job performance? Our analytical and experimental analysis of 3 production
traces with different skew and job distribution shows that learning in space
can be substantially more accurate. Our simulation and testbed evaluation on
Azure of the two learning approaches anchored in a generic job scheduler using
3 production cluster job traces shows that despite its online overhead,
learning in space reduces the average Job Completion Time (JCT) by 1.28x,
1.56x, and 1.32x compared to the prior-art history-based predictor.

parameters lying on a constrained space is of general interest (e.g., in
monotonic or convex regression), but often constructing valid prior
distributions supported on a subspace spanned by a set of linear inequality
constraints can be challenging, especially when some of the constraints might
be binding leading to a lower dimensional subspace. For the general case with
canonical link, it is shown that a generalized truncated multivariate normal
supported on a desired subspace can be used. Moreover, it is shown that such
prior distribution facilitates the construction of a general purpose product
slice sampling method to obtain (approximate) samples from corresponding
posterior distribution, making the inferential method computationally efficient
for a wide class of GLMs with an arbitrary set of linear inequality
constraints. The proposed product slice sampler is shown to be uniformly
ergodic, having a geometric convergence rate under a set of mild regularity
conditions satisfied by many popular GLMs (e.g., logistic and Poisson
regressions with constrained coefficients). One of the primary advantages of
the proposed Bayesian estimation method over classical methods is that
uncertainty of parameter estimates is easily quantified by using the samples
simulated from the path of the Markov Chain of the slice sampler. Numerical
illustrations using simulated data sets are presented to illustrate the
superiority of the proposed methods compared to some existing methods in terms
of sampling bias and variances. In addition, real case studies are presented

$\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q}=\frac{1}{2},p\geq 4$ still guarantees the validity of
energy conservation of $u$, no boundary layer assumptions are required when
dealing with domains with Lipschitz boundary. Compared to the existed methods,
our critical strategies are that we first separate the mollification of weak
solution from the boundary effect by considering non-standard local energy
equality and transform the boundary effects into the estimates of the gradient
of the cut-off functions, then by establishing a sharp $L^2L^2$ estimate for
pressure $P$ and using the zero boundary condition, we obtain global energy
equality by taking suitable cut-off functions. Our result provides a unified
method to deal with domains with or without boundary and improves the
corresponding results in \cite{C-L,Yu}.

condensation of electron-hole pairs. Bilayer heterostructures, consisting of
two-dimensional electron and hole layers separated by a tunnel barrier, provide
a versatile platform to realize and study EC. The tunnel barrier suppresses
recombination yielding long-lived excitons. However, this separation also
reduces interlayer Coulomb interactions, limiting the exciton binding strength.
Here, we report the observation of EC in naturally occurring 2H-stacked bilayer
WSe$_2$. In this system, the intrinsic spin-valley structure suppresses
interlayer tunneling even when the separation is reduced to the atomic limit,
providing access to a previously unattainable regime of strong interlayer
coupling. Using capacitance spectroscopy, we investigate magneto-EC, formed
when partially filled Landau levels (LL) couple between the layers. We find
that the strong-coupling EC show dramatically different behaviour compared with
previous reports, including an unanticipated variation of the EC robustness
with the orbital number, and find evidence for a transition between two types
of low-energy charged excitations. Our results provide a demonstration of
tuning EC properties by varying the constituent single-particle wavefunctions.

astrometric parameters (position, parallax, and proper motion) for more than 1
billion sources and is revolutionizing astrometry. For a fast-moving target
such as an asteroid, with many stars in the field of view that are brighter
than the faint limit magnitude of Gaia (21 Gmag), its measurement accuracy and
precision can be greatly improved by taking advantage of Gaia reference stars.
However, if we want to study the relative motions of cluster members, we could
cross-match them in different epochs based on pixel positions. For both types
of targets, the determination of optical field-angle distortion or called
geometric distortion (GD) in this paper is important for image calibration
especially when there are few reference stars to build a high-order plate
model. For the former, the GD solution can be derived based on the astrometric
catalogue's position, while for the latter, a reference system called 'master
frame' is constructed from these observations in pixel coordinates, and then
the GD solution is derived. But, are the two GD solutions in agreement with
each other? In this paper, two types of GD solutions, which are derived either
from the Gaia DR2 catalogue or from the self-constructed master frame, are
applied respectively for the observations taken by 1-m telescope at Yunnan
Observatory. It is found that two GD solutions enable the precision to achieve
a comparable level (~10 mas) but their GD patterns are different. Synthetic
distorted positions are generated for further investigation into the
discrepancy between the two GD solutions. We aim to find the correlation and
distinction between the two types of GD solutions and their applicability in
high precision astrometry.

Moreover, it proposes a strategy to build efficient preconditioners for any of

perform systematic benchmarking of a set of formulations and preconditioners,
focusing on the time to solution, matrix conditioning, and eigenvalue spectrum.
We see that the eigenvalue clustering is a good indicator of the matrix

preconditioner. Our results suggest that the optimal choice is problem-size

reconnection. This process removes a substantial amount of magnetic flux from
the system, and forms closed poloidal magnetic flux loops encircling the outer
disk in quasi-steady-state. These magnetic flux loops can drive expansion
beyond truncation radius, corresponding to substantial mass loss through
magnetized disk outflow beyond truncation radius analogous to a combination of
viscous spreading and external photoevaporation. The magnetic flux loops
gradually shrink over time whose rates depend on level of disk magnetization

formation. It is widely believed that planetesimal formation is the outcome of
dust clumping by the streaming instability (SI). However, recent analytical and
numerical studies have shown that the SI can be damped or suppressed by
external turbulence, and at least the outer regions of protoplanetary disks are
likely weakly turbulent due to magneto-rotational instability (MRI). We conduct
high-resolution local shearing-box simulations of hybrid particle-gas
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), incorporating ambipolar diffusion as the dominant
non-ideal MHD effect, applicable to outer disk regions. We first show that dust
backreaction enhances dust settling towards the midplane by reducing turbulence
correlation time. Under modest level of MRI turbulence, we find that dust
clumping is in fact easier than the conventional SI case, in the sense that the
threshold of solid abundance for clumping is lower. The key to dust clumping
includes dust backreaction and the presence of local pressure maxima, which in
our work is formed by the MRI zonal flows overcoming background pressure
gradient. Overall, our results support planetesimal formation in the
MRI-turbulent outer protoplanetary disks, especially in ring-like

we consider the effects of translational and rotational diffusion as well as
tumbling, i.e. sudden jumps in the swimmer orientation. Regardless of whether
diffusion or tumbling are the primary source of fluctuations, we find that
noise significantly increases the probability that a swimmer crosses one-way
barriers in the flow, which block the swimmer from returning to its initial

density of noisy swimmer trajectories in a given fluid flow, which produces
solutions to the time-dependent Fokker-Planck equation in the weak-noise limit.
This procedure mirrors the semiclassical approximation in quantum mechanics and
similarly involves calculating the least-action paths of a Hamiltonian system
derived from the swimmer's Fokker-Planck equation. Using the semiclassical
technique, we compute (i) the steady-state orientation distribution of swimmers

Prefetching, a method to mitigate the cost of reading in mixed workloads, masks
data transfer costs within processing time of prior tasks. We present an
implementation of ""Rolling Prefetch"", a Python library that implements a
particular form of prefetching from AWS S3 object store, and we quantify its
benefits.
  Rolling Prefetch extends S3Fs, a Python library exposing AWS S3 functionality
via a file object, to add prefetch capabilities. In measured analysis
performance of a 500 GB brain connectivity dataset stored on S3, we found that
prefetching provides significant speed-ups of up to 1.86x, even in applications
consisting entirely of data loading. The observed speed-up values are
consistent with our theoretical analysis. Our results demonstrate the

Commonly used random crop operation keeps the distribution of the difference

different scale objects, and the feature fusion method is improved to obtain
more information beneficial to small objects; secondly, batch normalization
layer is introduced to accelerate the training of neural network and make the
model sparse; finally, the model is pruned by scaling factor to get the

intelligent surface (RIS) for joint data modulation and signal beamforming in a
multi-user downlink cellular network by leveraging the idea of backscatter
communication. We present a general framework in which the RIS, referred to as
modulating intelligent surface (MIS) in this paper, is used to: i) beamform the
signals for a set of users whose data modulation is already performed by the
base station (BS), and at the same time, ii) embed the data of a different set
of users by passively modulating the deliberately sent carrier signals from the
BS to the RIS. To maximize each user's spectral efficiency, a joint non-convex
optimization problem is formulated under the sum minimum mean-square error
(MMSE) criterion. Alternating optimization is used to divide the original joint
problem into two tasks of: i) separately optimizing the MIS phase-shifts for
passive beamforming along with data embedding for the BS- and MIS-served users,
respectively, and ii) jointly optimizing the active precoder and the receive
scaling factor for the BS- and MIS-served users, respectively. While the
solution to the latter joint problem is found in closed-form using traditional
optimization techniques, the optimal phase-shifts at the MIS are obtained by
deriving the appropriate optimization-oriented vector approximate message
passing (OOVAMP) algorithm. Moreover, the original joint problem is solved
under both ideal and practical constraints on the MIS phase shifts, namely, the
unimodular constraint and assuming each MIS element to be terminated by a
variable reactive load. The proposed MIS-assisted scheme is compared against
state-of-the-art RIS-assisted wireless communication schemes and simulation
results reveal that it brings substantial improvements in terms of system
throughput while supporting a much higher number of users.

then model the multimodal entity inconsistency and mutual enhancement with the

learning initial parameters of the model and thus allowing fast adaptation to a
specific task from limited data examples. Though with significant performance
improvement, it commonly suffers from two critical issues: the
non-compatibility with mainstream industrial deployment and the heavy
computational burdens, both due to the inner-loop gradient operation. These two
issues make them hard to be applied in practical recommender systems. To enjoy
the benefits of meta learning framework and mitigate these problems, we propose
a recommendation framework called Contextual Modulation Meta Learning (CMML).
CMML is composed of fully feed-forward operations so it is computationally
efficient and completely compatible with the mainstream industrial deployment.
CMML consists of three components, including a context encoder that can
generate context embedding to represent a specific task, a hybrid context
generator that aggregates specific user-item features with task-level context,
and a contextual modulation network, which can modulate the recommendation
model to adapt effectively. We validate our approach on both scenario-specific

nonlinear integral equations. If the only wake fields are from cavity
resonators, the unknowns can be the Fourier transforms of bunch densities at
the resonator frequencies. The solution scheme based on this choice of unknowns
proved to be deficient at the design current when multiple resonators were
included. Here we return to the conventional formulation of Ha\""issinski
equations in coordinate space, the unknowns being charge densities at mesh
points on a fine grid. This system would be awkward to solve by the Newton
method used previously, because the Jacobian matrix is very large. Here a new
solution is described, which is both Jacobian-free and much simpler. It is
based on an elementary fixed point iteration, accelerated by Anderson's method.
The scheme is notably fast and robust, accommodating even the case of extreme
over-stretching at current far beyond the design value. The Anderson method is
promising for many problems in accelerator theory and beyond, since it is quite
simple and can be used to attack all kinds of nonlinear and linear integral and
differential equations. Results are presented for ALS-U, with updated design
parameters. The model includes harmonic and main r.f. cavities, compensation of
beam loading of the main cavity by adjustment of the generator voltage, and a
realistic short range wake field (rather than the broad-band resonator wake
invoked previously).

(UQ): (A) robust optimization, (B) Bayesian, (C) decision theory. Although (A)
is robust, it is unfavorable with respect to accuracy and data assimilation.
(B) requires a prior, it is generally brittle and posterior estimations can be
slow. Although (C) leads to the identification of an optimal prior, its
approximation suffers from the curse of dimensionality and the notion of risk
is one that is averaged with respect to the distribution of the data. We
introduce a 4th kind which is a hybrid between (A), (B), (C), and hypothesis
testing. It can be summarized as, after observing a sample $x$, (1) defining a
likelihood region through the relative likelihood and (2) playing a minmax game
in that region to define optimal estimators and their risk. The resulting
method has several desirable properties (a) an optimal prior is identified
after measuring the data, and the notion of risk is a posterior one, (b) the
determination of the optimal estimate and its risk can be reduced to computing
the minimum enclosing ball of the image of the likelihood region under the
quantity of interest map (which is fast and not subject to the curse of
dimensionality). The method is characterized by a parameter in $ [0,1]$ acting
as an assumed lower bound on the rarity of the observed data (the relative
likelihood). When that parameter is near $1$, the method produces a posterior
distribution concentrated around a maximum likelihood estimate with tight but
low confidence UQ estimates. When that parameter is near $0$, the method
produces a maximal risk posterior distribution with high confidence UQ
estimates. In addition to navigating the accuracy-uncertainty tradeoff, the
proposed method addresses the brittleness of Bayesian inference by navigating
the robustness-accuracy tradeoff associated with data assimilation.

dynamically assigned by the teacher (LAD). Our experiments reveal that: (i) LAD
is more effective than soft-label, but they are complementary. (ii) Using LAD,
a smaller teacher can also improve a larger student significantly, while
soft-label can't. We then introduce Co-learning LAD, in which two networks
simultaneously learn from scratch and the role of teacher and student are
dynamically interchanged. Using PAA-ResNet50 as a teacher, our LAD techniques
can improve detectors PAA-ResNet101 and PAA-ResNeXt101 to $46 \rm AP$ and

almost insurmountable obstacle to gauge the effectiveness of new mechanisms. In
view of those, we present the first fair and reproducible benchmark dedicated

to reconstruct the global distribution of this old stellar component is to
employ the superposition of the orbits covering over the large MW's space,
where each of the orbit-weighting factor is assigned following the probability
that the star is located at its currently observed position. The selected
local, metal-poor sample with ${\rm [Fe/H]}<-1$ using {\it Gaia} EDR3 and SDSS
DR16 shows that the global shape of the halo is systematically rounder at all
radii in more metal-poor ranges, such that an axial ratio, $q$, is nearly 1 for
${\rm [Fe/H]}<-2.2$ and $\sim 0.7$ for $-1.4<{\rm [Fe/H]}<-1.0$. It is also
found that a halo in relatively metal-rich range of ${\rm [Fe/H]}>-1.8$
actually shows a boxy/peanut-like shape, suggesting a major merger event. The
distribution of azimuthal velocities shows a disk-like flattened structure at
$-1.4<{\rm [Fe/H]}<-1.0$, which is thought to be the metal-weak thick disk. For
the subsample of stars showing GSE-like kinematics and at ${\rm [Fe/H]}>-1.8$,
its global density distribution is more spherical with $q \sim 0.9$ than the
general halo sample, having an outer ridge at $r\sim20$~kpc. This spherical
shape is consistent with the feature of accreted halo components and the ridge
suggests that the orbit of GSE's progenitor has an apocenter of $\sim 20$~kpc.
Implications for the formation of the stellar halo are also presented.

  Segmentation","ICCV2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  RGB-D semantic segmentation has attracted increasing attention over the past
few years. Existing methods mostly employ homogeneous convolution operators to
consume the RGB and depth features, ignoring their intrinsic differences. In
fact, the RGB values capture the photometric appearance properties in the
projected image space, while the depth feature encodes both the shape of a
local geometry as well as the base (whereabout) of it in a larger context.
Compared with the base, the shape probably is more inherent and has a stronger
connection to the semantics, and thus is more critical for segmentation
accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a Shape-aware
Convolutional layer (ShapeConv) for processing the depth feature, where the
depth feature is firstly decomposed into a shape-component and a
base-component, next two learnable weights are introduced to cooperate with
them independently, and finally a convolution is applied on the re-weighted
combination of these two components. ShapeConv is model-agnostic and can be
easily integrated into most CNNs to replace vanilla convolutional layers for
semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments on three challenging indoor RGB-D
semantic segmentation benchmarks, i.e., NYU-Dv2(-13,-40), SUN RGB-D, and SID,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our ShapeConv when employing it over five
popular architectures. Moreover, the performance of CNNs with ShapeConv is
boosted without introducing any computation and memory increase in the
inference phase. The reason is that the learnt weights for balancing the
importance between the shape and base components in ShapeConv become constants
in the inference phase, and thus can be fused into the following convolution,
resulting in a network that is identical to one with vanilla convolutional
layers.

$Y, (Y-K_{\rm s})$ colour-magnitude diagrams. In any of our selected
subregions, the RGB slope is used as an indicator of the average metallicity,
based on calibration to metallicity using spectroscopic data. The mean LMC
metallicity is [Fe/H] = $-$0.42~dex ($\sigma$[Fe/H] = 0.04~dex). We find the
bar to be mildly metal-rich compared with the outer disc, showing evidence of a
shallow gradient in metallicity ($-0.008 \pm 0.001$ dex kpc$^{-1}$) from the

The LMC's radial metallicity gradient is asymmetric. It is metal-poor and
flatter towards the southwest, in the direction of the Bridge. This hints at
mixing and/or distortion of the spatial metallicity distribution, presumably
caused by tidal interactions between the Magellanic Clouds.

hydrogen to three optical and near/mid-infrared spectral features of HI clouds:
extended red emission (ERE), diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs), and the
unidentified infrared bands (UIBs). DIBs, ERE, and UIBs are observed
predominantly at the edge of HI clouds, are manifestly related, and remain
poorly understood. Their salient properties correspond to two major
characteristics of HI Raman scattering: unusual line broadenings and a
concentration of the Raman scattered ultraviolet continuum in the vicinity of
hydrogen's optical and infrared transitions. Raman scattering by atomic
hydrogen has now been detected in several object classes where the spectral
features are observed, and I argue that it can account for all three features.
I further identify three factors that condition observation of Raman scattering
in HI clouds, and thus of DIBs, ERE, and UIBs: the hardness of the radiation
field, interstellar dust extinction, and the geometry of the observation. The
geometry determines whether complete forward scattering, yielding DIBs, or
scattering at large angles, yielding ERE in the vicinity of H{\alpha} and UIBs
in the infrared spectrum, will be observed. ERE results from Raman scattering
of photons near Ly\b{eta} and UIBs from excitation of hydrogen atoms close to
the ionization limit. DIBs, ERE, UIBs are thus different facets of the same
interstellar phenomenon: Raman scattering by atomic hydrogen.

understanding and decision making, explainable recommendation has been an
important research problem. In this paper, we propose Counterfactual
Explainable Recommendation (CountER), which takes the insights of
counterfactual reasoning from causal inference for explainable recommendation.
CountER is able to formulate the complexity and the strength of explanations,
and it adopts a counterfactual learning framework to seek simple (low
complexity) and effective (high strength) explanations for the model decision.
Technically, for each item recommended to each user, CountER formulates a joint
optimization problem to generate minimal changes on the item aspects so as to
create a counterfactual item, such that the recommendation decision on the
counterfactual item is reversed. These altered aspects constitute the
explanation of why the original item is recommended. The counterfactual
explanation helps both the users for better understanding and the system
designers for better model debugging. Another contribution of the work is the
evaluation of explainable recommendation, which has been a challenging task.
Fortunately, counterfactual explanations are very suitable for standard
quantitative evaluation. To measure the explanation quality, we design two
types of evaluation metrics, one from user's perspective (i.e. why the user
likes the item), and the other from model's perspective (i.e. why the item is
recommended by the model). We apply our counterfactual learning algorithm on a
black-box recommender system and evaluate the generated explanations on five
real-world datasets. Results show that our model generates more accurate and
effective explanations than state-of-the-art explainable recommendation models.

the system as edges, which are indexed in adjacency list indices and serve as
pointers. This contrasts with and can be more performant than value-based joins
in RDBMSs and has lead researchers to investigate ways to integrate predefined
joins directly into RDBMSs. Existing approaches adopt a strict separation of
graph and relational data and processors, where a graph-specific processor uses
left-deep and index nested loop joins for a subset of joins. This may be
suboptimal, and may lead to non-sequential scans of data in some queries. We
propose a purely relational approach to integrate predefined joins in columnar
RDBMSs that uses row IDs (RIDs) of tuples as pointers. Users can predefine
equality joins between any two tables, which leads to materializing RIDs in
extended tables and optionally in RID indices. Instead of using the RID index
to perform the join directly, we use it primarily in hash joins to generate
semi-join filters that can be passed to scans using sideways information
passing, ensuring sequential scans. In some settings, we also use RID indices
to reduce the number of joins in query plans. Our approach does not introduce
any graph-specific system components, can execute predefined joins on any join
plan, and can improve performance on any workload that contains equality joins
that can be predefined. We integrated our approach to DuckDB and call the
resulting system {\em GRainDB}. We demonstrate that GRainDB far improves the
performance of DuckDB on relational and graph workloads with large many-to-many
joins, making it competitive with a state-of-the-art GDBMS, and incurs no major
overheads otherwise.

denote the proximity parameter. A remarkable theorem of Newman-Sohler (SICOMP
2013) asserts that all properties of planar graphs (more generally hyperfinite)
are testable with query complexity only depending on $\varepsilon$. Recent
advances in testing minor-freeness have proven that all additive and monotone
properties of planar graphs can be tested in $poly(\varepsilon^{-1})$ queries.
Some properties falling outside this class, such as Hamiltonicity, also have a
similar complexity for planar graphs. Motivated by these results, we ask: can
all properties of planar graphs can be tested in $poly(\varepsilon^{-1})$
queries? Is there a uniform query complexity upper bound for all planar
properties, and what is the ""hardest"" such property to test? We discover a
surprisingly clean and optimal answer. Any property of bounded degree planar
graphs can be tested in $\exp(O(\varepsilon^{-2}))$ queries. Moreover, there is
a matching lower bound, up to constant factors in the exponent. The natural
property of testing isomorphism to a fixed graph needs
$\exp(\Omega(\varepsilon^{-2}))$ queries, thereby showing that (up to
polynomial dependencies) isomorphism to an explicit fixed graph is the hardest
property of planar graphs. The upper bound is a straightforward adapation of
the Newman-Sohler analysis that tracks dependencies on $\varepsilon$ carefully.
The main technical contribution is the lower bound construction, which is
achieved by a special family of planar graphs that are all mutually far from
each other. We can also apply our techniques to get analogous results for
bounded treewidth graphs. We prove that all properties of bounded treewidth
graphs can be tested in $\exp(O(\varepsilon^{-1}\log \varepsilon^{-1}))$

$\exp(\Omega(\varepsilon^{-1}))$ queries.

dense optical flow estimation from event cameras. Modern frame-based optical
flow methods heavily rely on matching costs computed from feature correlation.
In contrast, there exists no optical flow method for event cameras that
explicitly computes matching costs. Instead, learning-based approaches using
events usually resort to the U-Net architecture to estimate optical flow
sparsely. Our key finding is that the introduction of correlation features
significantly improves results compared to previous methods that solely rely on
convolution layers. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our proposed approach
computes dense optical flow and reduces the end-point error by 23% on MVSEC.
Furthermore, we show that all existing optical flow methods developed so far
for event cameras have been evaluated on datasets with very small displacement
fields with a maximum flow magnitude of 10 pixels. Based on this observation,
we introduce a new real-world dataset that exhibits displacement fields with
magnitudes up to 210 pixels and 3 times higher camera resolution. Our proposed
approach reduces the end-point error on this dataset by 66%.

behaviors within a short time period. Compared with other recommendation
paradigms, session-based recommendation suffers more from the problem of data
sparsity due to the very limited short-term interactions. Self-supervised
learning, which can discover ground-truth samples from the raw data, holds vast
potentials to tackle this problem. However, existing self-supervised
recommendation models mainly rely on item/segment dropout to augment data,
which are not fit for session-based recommendation because the dropout leads to
sparser data, creating unserviceable self-supervision signals. In this paper,
for informative session-based data augmentation, we combine self-supervised
learning with co-training, and then develop a framework to enhance
session-based recommendation. Technically, we first exploit the session-based
graph to augment two views that exhibit the internal and external
connectivities of sessions, and then we build two distinct graph encoders over
the two views, which recursively leverage the different connectivity
information to generate ground-truth samples to supervise each other by
contrastive learning. In contrast to the dropout strategy, the proposed
self-supervised graph co-training preserves the complete session information
and fulfills genuine data augmentation. Extensive experiments on multiple

the first dialogue system was commercialized, the basic architecture of such
systems has remained substantially unchanged, consisting of four pipelined
basic components, namely, natural language understanding (NLU), dialogue state

The dialogue manager, which is the critical component of the modularized
system, controls the response content and style. This module is usually
programmed by rules and is designed to be highly controllable and easily
extendable. With the emergence of powerful ""deep learning"" architectures,
end-to-end generative dialogue systems have been proposed to optimize overall
system performance and simplify training. However, these systems cannot be
easily controlled and extended as the modularized dialogue manager can. This is
because a single neural system is used, which is usually a large pre-trained
language model (e.g., GPT-2), and thus it is hard to surgically change
desirable attributes (e.g., style, topics, etc.). More importantly,
uncontrollable dialogue systems can generate offensive and even toxic
responses. Therefore, in this thesis, we study controllable methods for
end-to-end generative dialogue systems in task-oriented and chit-chat

Radio halos are megaparsec-scale diffuse radio sources{ mostly}
located at the centres of merging galaxy clusters. The common mechanism invoked
to explain their origin is the re-acceleration of relativistic particles caused
by large-scale turbulence. Aims. Current re-acceleration models predict that a
significant number of halos at high redshift should be characterised by very
steep spectra ($\alpha<-1.5$) because of increasing inverse Compton energy
losses. In this paper, we investigate the spectral index properties of a sample
of nine clusters selected from the second Planck Sunyaev-Zel'dovich catalogue
showing diffuse radio emission with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) in the
120-168 MHz band. This is the first time that radio halos discovered at low
frequencies are followed up at higher frequencies. Methods. We analysed
upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) observations in Bands 3 and 4,
that is, 250-500 and 550-900 MHz respectively. These observations were combined
with existing LOFAR data to obtain information on the spectral properties of
the diffuse radio emission. Results. We find diffuse radio emission in the
uGMRT observations for five of the nine high-$z$ radio halos previously
discovered with LOFAR. For those, we measure spectral indices in the range of
$-1$ to $-1.4$. For the uGMRT non-detections, we estimated that the halos
should have a spectral index steeper than $-1.5$. We also confirm the presence
of one candidate relic. Conclusions. Despite the small number of clusters, we
find evidence that about half of the massive and merging clusters at high
redshift host radio halos with a very steep spectrum. This is in line with
theoretical predictions, although larger statistical samples are necessary to
test models.

The nonlinear terms are treated perturbatively, using an $L^\infty$ control

with Arbitrary DERivative time stepping (ADER-DG) that copes with stiff source

  To integrate this source term with a reasonable time step size, we use an
element-local space-time predictor, which needs to solve medium-sized linear
systems - with 1000 to 10000 unknowns - in each element update (i.e., billions
of times). We present a novel block-wise back-substitution algorithm for
solving these systems efficiently. In comparison to LU decomposition, we reduce
the number of floating-point operations by a factor of up to 25. The block-wise
back-substitution is mapped to a sequence of small matrix-matrix
multiplications, for which code generators are available to generate highly
optimised code.
  We verify the new solver thoroughly in problems of increasing complexity. We
demonstrate high-order convergence for 3D problems. We verify the correct
treatment of point sources, material interfaces and traction-free boundary
conditions. In addition, we compare against a finite difference code for a
newly defined layer over half-space problem. We find that extremely high
accuracy is required to resolve the slow P-wave at a free surface, while solid
particle velocities are not affected by coarser resolutions. By using a
clustered local time stepping scheme, we reduce time to solution by a factor of
6 to 10 compared to global time stepping. We conclude our study with a scaling

large-scale DNN accelerators. In particular, interconnections between tiles are
critical for high performance in these tile-based architectures. In this work,
we identify the inefficiency of the widely used traditional on-chip networks
and the opportunity of software-hardware co-design. We propose METRO with the
basic idea of decoupling the traffic scheduling policies from hardware fabrics
and moving them to the software level. METRO contains two modules working in
synergy: METRO software scheduling framework to coordinate the traffics and
METRO hardware facilities to deliver the data based on software configurations.
We evaluate the co-design using different flit sizes for synthetic study,
illustrating its effectiveness under various hardware resource constraints, in
addition to a wide range of DNN models selected from real-world workloads. The
results show that METRO achieves 56.3% communication speedup on average and up
to 73.6% overall processing time reduction compared with traditional on-chip
network designs.

a promising technology for various tasks, such as sensing, inspection and
delivery. However, a typical UAV has limited energy storage and cannot fly a
long distance without being recharged. This motivates several existing
proposals to use trucks and other ground vehicles to offer riding to help UAVs
save energy and expand the operation radius. We present the first theoretical
study regarding how UAVs should optimally hitch on ground vehicles, considering
vehicles' different travelling patterns and supporting capabilities. For a
single UAV, we derive closed-form optimal vehicle selection and hitching
strategy. When vehicles only support hitching, a UAV would prefer the vehicle
that can carry it closest to its final destination. When vehicles can offer
hitching plus charging, the UAV may hitch on a vehicle that carries it farther
away from its destination and hitch a longer distance. The UAV may also prefer
to hitch on a slower vehicle for the benefit of battery recharging. For
multiple UAVs in need of hitching, we develop the max-saving algorithm (MSA) to
optimally match UAV-vehicle collaboration. We prove that the MSA globally
optimizes the total hitching benefits for the UAVs.

enables deep neural networks to learn hierarchically. We define the ""staircase""
property for functions over the Boolean hypercube, which posits that high-order
Fourier coefficients are reachable from lower-order Fourier coefficients along
increasing chains. We prove that functions satisfying this property can be
learned in polynomial time using layerwise stochastic coordinate descent on
regular neural networks -- a class of network architectures and initializations
that have homogeneity properties. Our analysis shows that for such staircase
functions and neural networks, the gradient-based algorithm learns high-level
features by greedily combining lower-level features along the depth of the
network. We further back our theoretical results with experiments showing that
staircase functions are also learnable by more standard ResNet architectures
with stochastic gradient descent. Both the theoretical and experimental results
support the fact that staircase properties have a role to play in understanding
the capabilities of gradient-based learning on regular networks, in contrast to
general polynomial-size networks that can emulate any SQ or PAC algorithms as
recently shown.

However, it is hard to learn the complicated multi-modal relations by only
architecture designing in fact. In this paper, we introduce a novel Support-set
Based Cross-Supervision (Sscs) module which can improve existing methods during
training phase without extra inference cost. The proposed Sscs module contains
two main components, i.e., discriminative contrastive objective and generative
caption objective. The contrastive objective aims to learn effective
representations by contrastive learning, while the caption objective can train
a powerful video encoder supervised by texts. Due to the co-existence of some
visual entities in both ground-truth and background intervals, i.e., mutual
exclusion, naively contrastive learning is unsuitable to video grounding. We
address the problem by boosting the cross-supervision with the support-set
concept, which collects visual information from the whole video and eliminates
the mutual exclusion of entities. Combined with the original objectives, Sscs
can enhance the abilities of multi-modal relation modeling for existing
approaches. We extensively evaluate Sscs on three challenging datasets, and

effects of spin wave fluctuations are ignored in sLLG. We propose to represent
the effect of these fluctuations by a ""FUll-Spinwave-Scaled Stochastic LLG"", or
FUSSS LLG method. In FUSSS LLG, the intrinsic parameters of the sLLG
simulations are first scaled by scaling factors that integrate out the spin
wave fluctuations up to the mesh size, and the sLLG simulation is then
performed with these scaled parameters. We developed FUSSS LLG by studying the
Ferromagnetic Resonance (FMR) in Nd$_2$Fe$_{14}$B cubes. The nominal scaling
greatly reduced the mesh size dependence relative to sLLG. We further
discovered that adjusting one scaling exponent by less than 10% delivered fully
mesh-size-independent results for the FMR peak. We then performed three tests
and validations of our FUSSS LLG with this modified scaling. 1) We studied the
same FMR but with magnetostatic fields included. 2) We simulated the total
magnetization of the Nd$_2$Fe$_{14}$B cube. 3) We studied the effective,
temperature- and sweeping rate-dependent coercive field of the cubes. In all
three cases we found that FUSSS LLG delivered essentially mesh-size-independent
results, which tracked the theoretical expectations better than unscaled sLLG.
Motivated by these successful validations, we propose that FUSSS LLG provides
marked, qualitative progress towards accurate, high precision modeling of
micromagnetics in hard, permanent magnets.

node-level representation based on neighborhood aggregation schemes, and to
obtain graph-level representation, pooling methods are applied after the
aggregation operation in existing GNN models to generate coarse-grained graphs.
However,due to highly diverse applications of graph classification, and the
performance of existing pooling methods vary on different graphs. In other
words, it is a challenging problem to design a universal pooling architecture
to perform well in most cases, leading to a demand for data-specific pooling
methods in real-world applications. To address this problem, we propose to use
neural architecture search (NAS) to search for adaptive pooling architectures

four modules: Aggregation, Pooling, Readout, and Merge, which can cover

few or no assumption on the nature of the signal. However, the computational
cost of those searches remains a limiting factor, which leads to sub-optimal

high-energy-density environment, especially in the inertial confinement fusion.
Due to the large gradient of macroscopic physical quantities and the coupled
thermal, electrical, magnetic and optical phenomena, there exist not only
hydrodynamic non-equilibrium (HNE) effects, but also strong thermodynamic
non-equilibrium (TNE) effects around the wavefront. In this work, a
two-dimensional single-fluid discrete Boltzmann model is proposed to
investigate the physical structure of ion shock. The electron is assumed
inertialess and always in thermodynamic equilibrium. The Rankine-Hugoniot
relations for single fluid theory of plasma shock wave is derived. It is found
that the physical structure of shock wave in plasma is significantly different
from that in normal fluid and somewhat similar to that of detonation wave from
the sense that a peak appears in the front. The non-equilibrium effects around
the shock front become stronger with increasing Mach number. The charge of
electricity deviates oppositely from neutrality in upstream and downstream of
the shock wave. The large inertia of the ions causes them to lag behind, so the
wave front charge is negative and the wave rear charge is positive. The
variations of HNE and TNE with Mach number are numerically investigated. The

BiCGStab, has been proposed. This method can achieve a higher degree of
scalability and speed-up rates through a mechanism in which the communication
phase for the computation of the inner product can be overlapped with the
computation of the matrix-vector product. On the other hand, there exist
several generalized iteration methods with better convergence behavior than
BiCGStab such as ssBiCGSafe, BiCGSafe, GPBi-CG. Of these methods, ssBiCGSafe,
which requires a single phase of computing inner products per one iteration, is
best suited for high-performance computing systems. In this paper, inspired by
the success of the pipelined BiCGStab method, we propose variations of the
ssBiCGSafe method, in which only one phase of inner product computation per
iteration is required and this inner product computation phase can be
overlapped with the matrix-vector computation. Through numerical experiments,
we show that the proposed methods lead to improvements in convergence behavior

computing complexity is reduced from $O(2^n)$ to $O(n^2)$, which makes it
possible to compute a large-scale repeated game's payoff. We explore the
evolution of cooperation in both infinitely and finitely repeated public goods

We adopt a data splitting technique to first reduce the dimensionality via
screening and then conduct GKnockoff on the refined selection set. Furthermore,
the powers of proposed methods are systematically studied. Numerical
comparisons with other methods show the superior performance of GKnockoff, in

an important and well-known feature in two-dimensional semiconductors,

theoretical and practical interest. To get a quantitative understanding of this
effect, here we calculate the quasiparticle band-gap renormalization of the
electron-doped monolayer MoS$_2$, a prototypical member of TMDs. The many-body
electron-electron interaction induced renormalization of the self-energy is
found within the random phase approximation and to account for the quasi-2D

with a nonlocal dielectric constant is used. Considering the renormalization of
both the valence and the conduction bands, our calculations reveal a large and
nonlinear band-gap renormalization upon adding free carriers to the conduction
band. We find a 410 meV reduction of the band gap for the monolayer MoS$_2$ on
SiO$_2$ substrate at the free carrier density $n=4.9\times 10^{12}

environment is also demonstrated in this work, and a much larger shrinkage of

in sleep scoring, the Monte Carlo dropout technique to enhance the performance
of the architecture and to also detect the uncertain instances. The evaluation

design and analyze numerical approximation methods to approximatively solve
nonlinear high-dimensional BSDEs. Although there are a large number of research
articles in the scientific literature which analyze numerical approximation

quality.
  This work presents an accurate and tool-less online OST calibration method to
update an offline-calibrated eye-display model. The user's bare hand is
markerlessly tracked by a commercial RGBD camera anchored to the OST headset to
generate a user-specific cursor for correspondence collection. The required
alignment is object-wise, and can provide thousands of unordered corresponding
points in tracked space. The collected correspondences are registered by a
proposed rotation-constrained iterative closest point (rcICP) method to
optimise the viewpoint-related calibration parameters. We implemented such a

to noisy data was evaluated through simulated tests and real experiments
performed with an eye-replacement camera. According to the simulation test, the

non-equilibrium electronic dynamics and finds wide applications across a range
of fields, from physics and chemistry to material science and biology. However,
a shortcoming of conventional pump-probe spectroscopy is that photoinduced
changes in transmission, reflection and scattering can simultaneously
contribute to the measured differential spectra, leading to ambiguities in
assigning the origin of spectral signatures and ruling out quantitative
interpretation of the spectra. Ideally, these methods would measure the
underlying dielectric function (or the complex refractive index) which would
then directly provide quantitative information on the transient excited state
dynamics free of these ambiguities. Here we present and test a model
independent route to transform differential transmission or reflection spectra,
measured via conventional optical pump-probe spectroscopy, to changes in the
quantitative transient dielectric function. We benchmark this method against
changes in the real refractive index measured using time-resolved Frequency
Domain Interferometry in prototypical inorganic and organic semiconductor

sets, allowing for an unambiguous and quantitative characterisation of the

recently been proposed to measure the target anatomy in a markerless and
effortless way, but the existing methods fail under real-world occlusion caused
by intraoperative interventions. Furthermore, such methods are
hardware-specific and not accurate enough for surgical applications. In this
paper, we propose a RGB-D sensing-based markerless tracking method that is
robust against occlusion. We design a new segmentation network that features
dynamic region-of-interest prediction and robust 3D point cloud segmentation.
As it is expensive to collect large-scale training data with occlusion
instances, we also propose a new method to create synthetic RGB-D images for
network training. Experimental results show that our proposed markerless
tracking method outperforms recent state-of-the-art approaches by a large
margin, especially when an occlusion exists. Furthermore, our method
generalises well to new cameras and new target models, including a cadaver,
without the need for network retraining. In practice, by using a high-quality
commercial RGB-D camera, our proposed visual tracking method achieves an
accuracy of 1-2 degress and 2-4 mm on a model knee, which meets the standard

open-loop control optimization. Due to its flexible assumptions, it can be
applied in a large variety of systems, including discontinuous ones or even
so-called black boxes, whose equations are not fully known. This aspect is
particularly important in mechanical systems, where friction or impact induced
discontinuities are common. The paper includes a mathematical background of the
new method, a detailed discussion of the algorithm and a numerical example, in
which control function of a discontinuous capsule drive is optimized. It is
expected that the proposed method can facilitate research in all areas where
control of non-smooth, discontinuous or black box systems is crucial. In
particular, authors hope that the presented algorithm is going to be used for
control optimization of other capsule drives.

telecommunication (Telco) cellular networks. For example, measurement records
(MRs) are generated to report the connection states between mobile devices and
Telco networks, e.g., received signal strength. MR data have been widely used
to localize outdoor mobile devices for human mobility analysis, urban planning,
and traffic forecasting. Existing works using first-order sequence models such
as the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) attempt to capture spatio-temporal locality in
underlying mobility patterns for lower localization errors. The HMM approaches
typically assume stable mobility patterns of the underlying mobile devices. Yet
real MR datasets exhibit heterogeneous mobility patterns due to mixed
transportation modes of the underlying mobile devices and uneven distribution
of the positions associated with MR samples. Thus, the existing solutions
cannot handle these heterogeneous mobility patterns. we propose a multi-task
learning-based deep neural network (DNN) framework, namely PRNet+, to
incorporate outdoor position recovery and transportation mode detection. To
make sure the framework work, PRNet+ develops a feature extraction module to
precisely learn local-, short- and long-term spatio-temporal locality from
heterogeneous MR samples. Extensive evaluation on eight datasets collected at
three representative areas in Shanghai indicates that PRNet+ greatly
outperforms state-of-the-arts.

wireless sensor networks using multiple unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) to gather
data at designated rendezvouses, where the goal is to maximize the network
lifetime. Previous proposals often consider a practical approach where the
problem of determining a data gathering scheme is decomposed into 2
sub-problems: i) partitioning the networks into clusters for determining the
rendezvouses as these obtained cluster heads; and ii) determining the paths for
a set of a given number of UAVs to come gathering data at these rendezvouses
which have been harvesting data within each local clusters, respectively. We
try to deal with this as a whole optimization problem, expecting a significant
increase in computation complexity which would bring new challenge in creating
practical solutions for large-scale WSNs. We introduce two alternatives
mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulations, namely the 2-index model
with $O(n^2)$ variables and the 3-index model that has $O(n^3)$ variables,
where $n$ denotes the number of sensor nodes. We show that our best model could
solve optimally the problem instances with up to 50 sensor nodes in less than
30 minutes. Next, we propose a heuristic idea to reduce the number of variables
in implementing the 3-index model to effectively handle larger-scale networks
with size in hundreds. The experiment results show that our heuristic approach
significantly prolongs the network lifetime compared to existing most efficient
proposals.

structured illumination and single-pixel detection together, to efficiently

with the subsequent reconstruction neural network, which directly infers

strain on the next-nearest neighbor coupling, and the second-order
contributions of the strain tensor. We derive the corresponding low-energy

we evaluate the transmission across a strained graphene heterostructure
consisting of a central segment sandwiched between two unstrained leads.
Modulation of the transmitted current can be effected by varying the magnitude

Based on realistic parameter values, we predict that high ON-OFF ratios of up

shown that the LF-LFWFs get narrower in $x$ (the longitudinal momentum fraction
of meson carried by the quark) with the increasing current quark mass, and the
leading twist parton distribution amplitudes (PDAs) inherit this feature.
Meanwhile, we find in the pion the LF-LFWFs only contribute around 30\% to the

between human and autonomous robot commands. We present a reinforcement
learning solution that learns an optimal arbitration strategy that allocates
more control authority to the human when the robot comes across a decision
point in the task. A decision point is where the robot encounters multiple
options (sub-policies), such as having multiple paths to get around an obstacle
or deciding between two candidate goals. By expressing each directional
sub-policy as a von Mises distribution, we identify the decision points by
observing the modality of the mixture distribution. Our reward function reasons
on this modality and prioritizes to match its learned policy to either the user
or the robot accordingly. We report teleoperation experiments on
reach-and-grasping objects using a robot manipulator arm with different
simulated human controllers. Results indicate that our shared control agent
outperforms direct control and improves the teleoperation performance among
different users. Using our reward term enables flexible blending between human

some Hilbert space $\mathcal H,$ which has a $\Gamma_3$-isometric dilation, but
it fails to satisfy the following condition: $$E_1^*E_1-E_1E_1^*=

solution of PDEs is non-trivial and often involves significant computational
time. With recent developments in the field of artificial intelligence and
machine learning, the solution of PDEs using neural network has emerged as a
domain with huge potential. However, most of the developments in this field are
based on either fully connected neural networks (FNN) or convolutional neural
networks (CNN). While FNN is computationally inefficient as the number of
network parameters can be potentially huge, CNN necessitates regular grid and
simpler domain. In this work, we propose a novel framework referred to as the
Graph Attention Differential Equation (GrADE) for solving time dependent
nonlinear PDEs. The proposed approach couples FNN, graph neural network, and
recently developed Neural ODE framework. The primary idea is to use graph
neural network for modeling the spatial domain, and Neural ODE for modeling the
temporal domain. The attention mechanism identifies important inputs/features
and assign more weightage to the same; this enhances the performance of the
proposed framework. Neural ODE, on the other hand, results in constant memory
cost and allows trading of numerical precision for speed. We also propose depth
refinement as an effective technique for training the proposed architecture in
lesser time with better accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed framework
is illustrated using 1D and 2D Burgers' equations. Results obtained illustrate
the capability of the proposed framework in modeling PDE and its scalability to

techniques from 2G to upcoming 5G. Precise outdoor localization is important
for Telco operators to manage, operate and optimize Telco networks. Differing
from GPS, Telco localization is a technique employed by Telco operators to
localize outdoor mobile devices by using measurement report (MR) data. When
given MR samples containing noisy signals (e.g., caused by Telco signal
interference and attenuation), Telco localization often suffers from high
errors. To this end, the main focus of this paper is how to improve Telco
localization accuracy via the algorithms to detect and repair outlier positions
with high errors. Specifically, we propose a context-aware Telco localization
technique, namely RLoc, which consists of three main components: a
machine-learning-based localization algorithm, a detection algorithm to find
flawed samples, and a repair algorithm to replace outlier localization results
by better ones (ideally ground truth positions). Unlike most existing works to
detect and repair every flawed MR sample independently, we instead take into
account spatio-temporal locality of MR locations and exploit trajectory context
to detect and repair flawed positions. Our experiments on the real MR data sets
from 2G GSM and 4G LTE Telco networks verify that our work RLoc can greatly
improve Telco location accuracy. For example, RLoc on a large 4G MR data set
can achieve 32.2 meters of median errors, around 17.4% better than
state-of-the-art.

understanding the principles of their work and improving their design. We
present a new pseudospectral method for two-dimensional magnetization and
transport current superconducting strip problems with an arbitrary
current-voltage relation, spatially inhomogeneous strips, and strips in a
nonuniform applied field. The method is based on the bivariate expansions in
Chebyshev polynomials and Hermite functions. It can be used for numerical
modeling magnetic flux pumps of different types and investigating AC losses in
coated conductors with local defects. Using a realistic two-dimensional version
of the superconducting dynamo benchmark problem as an example, we showed that
our new method is a competitive alternative to finite element methods.

Most of the review articles that handle the energy TSF problem are systematic

twofold, first it provides a comprehensive analytical assessment for
conventional,machine learning, and deep learning methods that can be utilized

natural gas problem, and electric power consumption of an individual household
problem.The first two problems are univariate TSF and the third problem is a
multivariate TSF. Com-pared to both conventional and machine learning
contenders, the deep learning methods attain a significant improvement in terms
of accuracy and forecasting horizons examined. In the mean-time, their
computational requirements are notably greater than other contenders.
Eventually,the paper identifies a number of challenges, potential research

emerge from the introduction of fractional calculus in a usual model of

feature of the model is that all measurable quantities are predicted to depend
in a non-trivial way on external parameters (e.g. the experimental set-up
geometry, in particular the sample size). On the basis of an unprecedented
comparative analysis of a collection of published experimental data, the
modeling is applied to the case of water in all its fluid phases, in particular
in the supercooled phase. It is shown that the discrepancies in the literature

experimental configurations. This approach makes it possible to reproduce the
water viscosity with a better accuracy than the 2008 IAPWS formulation and also
with a more physically satisfying modeling of the isochors. Moreover, it also
allows the modeling within experimental accuracy of the translational
self-diffusion data available in the literature in all water fluid phases.

anomalies observed on the dynamic viscosity and self-diffusion coefficient and
their possible links.

cluster in the very nearby M81 galaxy. The associated globular cluster has an

work, we consider that an FRB source is in a close binary system with a
low-mass main sequence star as its companion. Due to the large burst energy of
the FRB, when the companion star stops the FRB, its surface would be heated by
the radiation-induced shock, and make re-emission. For a binary system with a
solar-like companion star and an orbital period of a few days, we find that the
re-emission is mainly at optical band, and with delays of a few seconds after
the FRB. Its luminosity is several times larger than the solar luminosity, and
the duration is about hundreds of seconds. Such a transient might be observable
in the future multiwavelength follow-up observation for Galactic FRB sources.

multi-tracer analysis of LOFAR data to three additional fields in the
surroundings of the 3C 196 field. For the first time, we study the
three-dimensional structure of the LOFAR emission by determining the distance
to the depolarisation canals. We use the Rolling Hough Transform to compare the
orientation of the depolarisation canals with that of the filamentary structure
seen in HI and, based on starlight and dust polarisation data, with that of the
plane-of-the-sky magnetic field. Stellar parallaxes from $Gaia$ complement the
starlight polarisation with the corresponding distances. Faraday tomography of
the three fields shows a rich network of diffuse polarised emission at Faraday
depths between $-10~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$ and $+15~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$. A complex
system of straight depolarisation canals resembles that of the 3C 196 field.
The depolarisation canals align both with the HI filaments and with the
magnetic field probed by dust. The observed alignment suggests that an ordered
magnetic field organises the multiphase ISM over a large area
($\sim$20$^{\circ}$). In one field, two groups of stars at distances below and
above 200 pc, respectively, show distinct magnetic-field orientations. These
are both comparable with the orientations of the depolarisation canals in the

change of the magnetic field as probed by the stars, which corresponds to the
edge of the Local Bubble.

Furthermore, we provide quantifications of the intrinsic quality and use them

perform Monte-Carlo (MC) and statistical calculations to determine dissociation
rates for coronene, circumcoronene and circumcoronene clusters with sizes
between 2 and 200 cluster members. By applying general disk models to our
Herbig Ae/Be and T Tauri star model, we estimate the formation rate of PAH
dimers and compare these with the dissociation rates. We show that the
formation of PAH dimers can take place in the inner 100 AU of protoplanetary
disks in sub-photospheric layers. Dimer formation takes seconds to years
allowing them to grow beyond dimer size in a short time. We further demonstrate
that PAH cluster increase their stability while they grow if they are located
beyond a critical distance that depends on stellar properties and PAH species.
The comparison with the local vertical mixing time scale allows a determination
of the minimum cluster size necessaryfor survival of PAH clusters. Considering
the PAH cluster formation sites, cluster survival in the photosphere of the
inner disk of Herbig stars isunlikely because of the high UV radiation. For the
T Tauri stars, survival of coronene, circumcoronene and circumcircumcoronene

climatic and anthropogenic risk factors and potential hosts from a literature
review. Geographical data layers, representing risk factors, were combined to
produce suitability maps of Ebola virus spillover at the landscape scale. Our
maps show high spatial and temporal variability in the suitability for Ebola
virus spillover at a fine regional scale. Reported spillover events fell in
areas of intermediate to high suitability in our maps, and a sensitivity
analysis showed that the maps produced were robust. There are still important
gaps in our knowledge about what factors are associated with the risk of Ebola
virus spillover. As more information becomes available, maps produced using the
GIS-MCE approach can be easily updated to improve surveillance and the
prevention of future outbreaks.

NLSE solutions as its outputs. By taking into account of pulses and signals

them very attractive for ultrafast science. However, for capturing sub-200 fs
dynamics, efficient, high-fidelity, and high-stability pulse compression
techniques are essential. Spectral broadening using an all-solid-state
free-space geometry is particularly attractive, as it is simple, robust, and
low-cost. However, spatial and temporal losses caused by spatio-spectral
inhomogeneities have been a major challenge to date, due to coupled space-time
dynamics associated with unguided nonlinear propagation. In this work, we use
all-solid-state free-space compressors to demonstrate compression of 170 fs
pulses at a wavelength of 1030nm from a Yb:KGW laser to ~9.2 fs, with a highly
spatially homogeneous mode. This is achieved by ensuring that the nonlinear
beam propagation in periodic layered Kerr media occurs in soliton modes and
confining the nonlinear phase through each material layer to less than 1.0 rad.
A remarkable spatio-spectral homogeneity of ~0.87 can be realized, which yields
a high efficiency of >50% for few-cycle compression. The universality of the
method is demonstrated by implementing high-quality pulse compression under a
wide range of laser conditions. The high spatiotemporal quality and the
exceptional stability of the compressed pulses are further verified by
high-harmonic generation. This work represents the highest efficiency and the
best spatio-spectral quality ever achieved by an all-solid-state free-space

can be a useful tool for observing nonclassical features of both radiation and
motion. While this tool has been employed in experiments with pulsed laser
driving of a cavity mode, it has not been readily accessible to experiments
with continuous and constant laser driving. To address this, we present a study
of a standard optomechanical system where the cavity mode is continuously
driven at two different frequencies, and where sideband photons are detected by
single photon detectors after frequency filtering the output from the cavity
mode around its resonance frequency. We first derive the normalized second
order coherence associated with the detected photons, and show that it contains
signatures of the quantum nature of the mechanical mode which would be absent
with only single-tone driving. To identify model-independent nonclassical
features, we derive two inequalities for the sideband photon statistics that
should be valid in any classical model of the system. We show that these
inequalities are violated in the proposed setup. This is provided that the
average phonon occupation number of the mechanical mode is sufficiently small,
which in principle can be achieved through sideband cooling intrinsic to the
setup. Violation of the first inequality means that there is no well-defined
probability distribution of the Glauber-Sudarshan type for the cavity mode. In
contrast, a violation of the second inequality means that there is no joint
probability distribution for the cavity mode at two times separated by a finite
interval, which originates from the noncommutativity of the motional
quadratures of the mechanical mode. The proposed setup thus employs a
mechanical oscillator in order to generate a steady-state source of
nonclassical radiation.

choosing a fiducial model one can also use it to constrain the model
parameters. We compare the constraining power of redshift drift measurements by
the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), as studied by Liske {\it et al.} (2008),
with that of two recently proposed alternatives: the cosmic accelerometer of
Eikenberry {\it et al.} (2020), and the differential redshift drift of Cooke
(2020). We find that the cosmic accelerometer with a 6-year baseline leads to
weaker constraints than those of the ELT (by $60\%$), but with identical time
baselines it outperforms the ELT by up to a factor of 6. The differential
redshift drift always performs worse that the standard approach if the goal is
to constrain the matter density, but it can perform significantly better than
it if the goal is to constrain the dark energy equation of state. Our results
show that accurately measuring the redshift drift and using these measurements
to constrain cosmological parameters are different merit functions: an
experiment optimized for one of them will not be optimal for the other. These
non-trivial trade-offs must be kept in mind as next generation instruments
enter their final design and construction phases.

CSEs of low-mass-loss-rate (low-MLR) S-stars fall between the sizes of the CSEs
of C-stars, which are larger, and those of M-stars, which are smaller, as
expected because of the differences in their respective CO abundances. The
sizes of the low-MLR S-type stars show no dependence on circumstellar density,
while a steeper density dependence is observed at high MLR. Furthermore, our
results show that the CO CSEs of most of the S-stars in our sample are
consistent with a spherically symmetric and smooth outflow. The CO envelope
sizes obtained in this paper will be used to constrain detailed radiative
transfer modelling to directly determine more accurate MLR estimates for the

from spherical symmetry, further high-resolution observations would be
necessary to investigate the nature of, and the physical processes behind,
these asymmetrical structures. This will provide further insight into the

electrical breakdown physics of low-pressure nitrogen irradiated by an intense
pulsed electron beam. The rapidly rising beam current induces an electric field
which drives a return current in the plasma. The rigid-beam model is a
reduction of the problem geometry to cylindrical coordinates and
simplifications to Maxwell's equations that are driven by a prescribed electron
beam current density. The model is convenient for comparing various reductions
of the plasma dynamics and plasma chemistry while maintaining a good
approximation to the overall magnitude of the beam-created electric field. The
usefulness of this model is demonstrated by coupling the rigid-beam model to a
fluid plasma model and a simplified nitrogen plasma chemistry. The dynamics of
this coupled system are computed for a range of background gas pressures, and
the results are compared with experimental measurements. At pressures 1 Torr
and above, the simulated line-integrated electron densities are within a factor
of two of measurements, and show the same trend with pressure as observed in

between pairs of columns of a table. Generally, RE models for this task require
labelled tables for training. These labelled tables can also be generated

much lower in comparison to manual annotations. However, unlike real tables,
these synthetic tables lack associated metadata, such as, column-headers,

degradation of the target surface caused by ablation. An alternative to
mounting the target onto a rotation wheel or $x-y$ translation stage, is to
shift the laser position with a final reflection from a motorized kinematic
mirror mount. Such a system has been developed, assembled and characterized
with a two axis motorized mirror and various metal targets. In the system
presented here, ions are ablated from the target surface and guided by a 90

Spatially resolved scans of the target are produced by actuating the mirror
motors, thus moving the laser spot across the target, and performing
synchronous measurements of the ion current to construct 2D images of a target
surface which can be up to 50~mm in diameter. The spatial resolution of the
system has been measured by scanning the interfaces between metals such as
steel and niobium, where it was demonstrated that the LAS can selectively
ablate an area of diameter $\approx$50 $\mu$m. This work informs the
development of subsequent LAS systems, that are intended to serve as
multi-element ion sources for commercial and custom-built time-of-flight mass
spectrometers, or to selectively study surface specific regions of samples.

globule (mass ~240 Msun, length ~1.5 pc) with an internal HII region created by
the stellar feedback of embedded intermediate-mass stars, in particular, one
Herbig Be star. Here, we present a Herschel/HIFI CII 158 mu map of the whole
globule and a large set of other FIR lines (mid-to high-J CO lines observed
with Herschel/PACS and SPIRE, the OI 63 mu line and the CO 16-15 line observed
with upGREAT on SOFIA), covering the globule head and partly a position in the
tail. The CII map revealed that the whole globule is probably rotating. Highly
collimated, high-velocity CII emission is detected close to the Herbig Be star.
We performed a PDR analysis using the KOSMA-tau PDR code for one position in
the head and one in the tail. The observed FIR lines in the head can be
reproduced with a two-component model: an extended, non-clumpy outer PDR shell
and a clumpy, dense, and thin inner PDR layer, representing the interface
between the HII region cavity and the external PDR. The modelled internal UV
field of ~2500 Go is similar to what we obtained from the Herschel FIR fluxes,
but lower than what we estimated from the census of the embedded stars.
External illumination from the ~30 pc distant Cyg OB2 cluster, producing an UV
field of ~150-600 G0 as an upper limit, is responsible for most of the CII
emission. For the tail, we modelled the emission with a non-clumpy component,
exposed to a UV-field of around 140 Go.

gradients onto the qubits, making the spin states susceptible to electric field
noise and limiting their coherence times. We describe here a magnet design that
minimizes qubit dephasing, while allowing for fast qubit control and
addressability. Specifically, we design and optimize magnet dimensions and
position relative to the quantum dots, minimizing dephasing from magnetic field
gradients. The micromagnet-induced dephasing rates with this design are up to
3-orders of magnitude lower than state-of-the-art implementations, allowing for
long coherence times. This design is robust against fabrication errors, and can
be combined with a wide variety of silicon qubit device geometries, thereby
allowing exploration of coherence limiting factors and novel upscaling

potential health risks of CT-associated X-ray radiation to patients. Reducing
the radiation dose, however, decreases the quality of the reconstructed images,
which consequently compromises the diagnostic performance. Various deep
learning techniques have been introduced to improve the image quality of LDCT
images through denoising. GANs-based denoising methods usually leverage an
additional classification network, i.e. discriminator, to learn the most
discriminate difference between the denoised and normal-dose images and, hence,
regularize the denoising model accordingly; it often focuses either on the
global structure or local details. To better regularize the LDCT denoising
model, this paper proposes a novel method, termed DU-GAN, which leverages U-Net
based discriminators in the GANs framework to learn both global and local
difference between the denoised and normal-dose images in both image and
gradient domains. The merit of such a U-Net based discriminator is that it can
not only provide the per-pixel feedback to the denoising network through the
outputs of the U-Net but also focus on the global structure in a semantic level
through the middle layer of the U-Net. In addition to the adversarial training
in the image domain, we also apply another U-Net based discriminator in the
image gradient domain to alleviate the artifacts caused by photon starvation
and enhance the edge of the denoised CT images. Furthermore, the CutMix
technique enables the per-pixel outputs of the U-Net based discriminator to
provide radiologists with a confidence map to visualize the uncertainty of the
denoised results, facilitating the LDCT-based screening and diagnosis.
Extensive experiments on the simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate
superior performance over recently published methods both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

energies, on account of their nonthermal emission. The observational progress
from radio to gamma-ray observations reveals more and more morphological
features that need to be accounted for when modeling the emission from those
objects.
  We use our time-dependent acceleration code RATPaC to study the formation of
extended gamma-ray halos around supernova remnants and the morphological
implications that arise when the high-energetic particles start to escape from
the SNRs.
  We performed spherically symmetric 1D simulations in which we simultaneously
solved the transport equations for cosmic rays, magnetic turbulence, and the
hydrodynamical flow of the thermal plasma. Our simulations span 25,000 years,
thus covering the free-expansion and the Sedov-Taylor phase of the SNR's
evolution.
  We find a strong difference in the morphology of the gamma-ray emission from
SNRs at later stages dependent on the emission process. At early times, both
the inverse-Compton and the Pion-decay morphology are shell-like. However, as
soon as the maximum-energy of the freshly accelerated particles starts to fall,
the inverse-Compton morphology starts to become center-filled, whereas the
Pion-decay morphology keeps its shell-like structure. Escaping high-energy
electrons start to form an emission halo around the SNR at this time. There are
good prospects for detecting this spectrally hard emission with the future
Cerenkov Telescope Array, as there are for detecting variations in the
gamma-ray spectral index across the interior of the SNR. Further, we find a
constantly decreasing nonthermal X-ray flux that makes a detection of X-ray
unlikely after the first few thousand years of the SNR's evolution. The radio
flux is increasing throughout the SNR's lifetime and changes from a shell-like
to a more center-filled morphology later on.

ultra-high cosmic rays (UHECRs), constrain the distribution of binary
black-hole mergers and identify some of the components of the extragalactic
gamma-ray background. This contribution summarizes the efforts of cleaning and
complementing the catalogs developed by the gravitational-wave and
near-infrared communities, in order to obtain a cosmographic view on stellar
mass ($M_*$) and star formation rate (SFR). Unprecedented cosmography is
offered by a sample of about 400,000 galaxies within 350 Mpc, with a 50-50
ratio of spectroscopic and photometric distances, $M_*$, SFR and corrections
for incompleteness with increasing distance and decreasing Galactic latitude.
The inferred 3D distribution of $M_*$ and SFR is consistent with Cosmic Flows.
The $M_*$ and SFR densities converge towards values compatible with deep-field
observations beyond 100 Mpc, suggesting a close-to-isotropic distribution of
more distant sources. In addition to highlighting relevant applications for the
four astroparticle communities, this contribution explores the distribution of
$B$-fields at Mpc scales deduced from the 3D distribution of matter, which is
believed to be crucial in shaping the ultra-high-energy sky. These efforts
provide a new basis for modeling UHECR anisotropies, which bodes well for the

one-impurity embedded models, requiring at most four qubits and relatively
shallow circuits, we solve a two-impurity model requiring eight qubits with an
advanced hybrid scheme on top of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver algorithm.
This iterative scheme, dubbed Natural Orbitalization (NOization), gradually
transforms the single-particle basis to the approximate Natural-Orbital basis,
in which the ground state can be minimally expressed, at the cost of measuring
the one-particle reduced density-matrix of the embedded problem. We show that
this transformation tends to make the variational optimization of existing (but
too deep) ansatz circuits faster and more accurate, and we propose an ansatz,
the Multireference Excitation Preserving (MREP) ansatz, that achieves great
expressivity without requiring a prohibitive gate count. The one-impurity
version of the ansatz has only one parameter, making the ground state
preparation a trivial step, which supports the optimal character of our
approach. Within a Rotationally Invariant Slave Boson embedding scheme that
requires a minimal number of bath sites and does not require computing the full
Green's function, the NOization combined with the MREP ansatz allow us to
compute accurate, space-resolved quasiparticle weights and static self-energies
for the Hubbard model even in the presence of noise levels representative of

between the LSCO films and the substrates induces in-plane strain ranging from
-2.06% (compressive) to +1.75% (tensile). The electric conductivity can be
controlled over 2 orders of magnitude, ranging from 0.5 S/cm (tensile strain)
to 35 S/cm (compressive strain). Consistently, the Seebeck coefficient S can be
finely tuned by a factor of almost 2 from 127 microV/K (compressive strain) to

classical polyline simplification problem. Given a set of polylines, which may
share line segments and points, PBS asks for the smallest consistent
simplification of these polylines with respect to a given distance threshold.
Here, consistent means that each point is either kept in or discarded from all
polylines containing it. In previous work, it was proven that PBS is NP-hard to
approximate within a factor of $n^{\frac{1}{3}-\varepsilon}$ for any
$\varepsilon > 0$ where $n$ denotes the number of points in the input. This
hardness result holds even for two polylines. In this paper we first study the
practically relevant setting of planar inputs. While for many combinatorial
optimization problems the restriction to planar settings makes the problem
substantially easier, we show that the inapproximability bound known for
general inputs continues to hold even for planar inputs. We proceed with the
interesting special case of PBS where the polylines form a rooted tree. Such
tree bundles naturally arise in the context of movement data visualization. We
prove that optimal simplifications of these tree bundles can be computed in
$O(n^3)$ for the Fr\'echet distance and in $O(n^2)$ for the Hausdorff distance
(which both match the computation time for single polylines). Furthermore, we
present a greedy heuristic that allows to decompose polyline bundles into tree
bundles in order to make our exact algorithm for trees useful on general
inputs. The applicability of our approaches is demonstrated in an experimental
evaluation on real-world data.

paper, we address the representation of lattice bosonic fields in a discretized

efficient qubit implementation strategies. A low-energy subspace of the bosonic
Hilbert space, defined by a boson occupation cutoff, can be represented with
exponentially good accuracy by a low-energy subspace of a finite size Hilbert

directly related to the accuracy of the Nyquist-Shannon sampling and the Finite
Fourier transforms of the boson number states in the field and the
conjugate-field bases. We analyze the relation between the boson mass, the
discretization parameters used for wavefunction sampling and the finite
representation size. Numerical simulations of small size $\Phi^4$ problems
demonstrate that the boson mass optimizing the sampling of the ground state
wavefunction is a good approximation to the optimal boson mass yielding the
minimum low-energy subspace size. However, we find that accurate sampling of
general wavefunctions does not necessarily result in accurate representation.

QDAfs applies Partial Correlation Screening to estimate $\hat{\Omega}_0$ and

dense signals; 2) QDAfs for relatively strong but sparse signals. We figure out
the classification boundary on the 4-dim parameter space: 1) Region of
possibility, where either QDAw or QDAfs will achieve a mis-classification error
rate of 0; 2) Region of impossibility, where all classifiers will have a
constant error rate.

three-dimensional hydrodynamical code FLASH we follow the evolution of the RSG

90 per cent of the RSG envelope mass inner to the merger site stays bound to
the RSG. NSs that experience a CEE are likely to accrete RSG envelope mass
through an accretion disk that launches jets. These jets power a luminous
transient event, a common envelope jets supernova (CEJSN). The merger process
adds to the CEJSN energy. Our finding implies that the interaction of the
merger product, a massive NS or a BH, with the envelope can continue to release
more energy, both by further in-spiral and by mass accretion by the merger
product. Massive RSG envelopes can force the merger product to spiral-in into
the core of the RSG, leading to an even more energetic CEJSN.

  Models via Low-Rank Approximation",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  In this thesis, we introduce Greenformers, a collection of model efficiency
methods to improve the model efficiency of the recently renowned transformer
models with a low-rank approximation approach. The development trend of deep
learning models tends to results in a more complex and larger model. Although
it leads to a better and more accurate prediction, the resulting model becomes
even more costly, as it requires weeks of training with a huge amount of GPU
resources. Particularly, the size and computational cost of transformer-based
models have increased tremendously since its first debut in 2017 from ~100
million parameters up to ~1.6 trillion parameters in early 2021. This
computationally hungry model also incurs a substantial cost to the environment
and even reaches an alarming level of carbon footprint. Some of these models
are so massive that it is even impossible to run the model without a GPU
cluster.
  Greenformers improve the model efficiency of transformer models by applying
low-rank approximation approaches. Specifically, we propose a low-rank
factorization approach to improve the efficiency of the transformer model
called Low-Rank Transformer. We further compare our model with an existing
low-rank factorization approach called Linformer. Based on our analysis, the
Low-Rank Transformer model is suitable for improving both the time and memory
efficiency in processing short-sequence (<= 512) input data, while the
Linformer model is suitable for improving the efficiency in processing
long-sequence input data (>= 512). We also show that Low-Rank Transformer is
more suitable for on-device deployment, as it significantly reduces the model
size. Additionally, we estimate that applying LRT to the existing BERT-base
model can significantly reduce the computational, economical, and environmental
costs for developing such models by more than 30% of its original costs.

CNN-based detectors, these two pillars are optimized independently. Without
direct interactions between them, the classification loss and the regression
loss can not be optimized synchronously toward the optimal direction in the
training phase. This clearly leads to lots of inconsistent predictions with
high classification score but low localization accuracy or low classification
score but high localization accuracy in the inference phase, especially for the
objects of irregular shape and occlusion, which severely hurts the detection
performance of existing detectors after NMS. To reconcile prediction
consistency for balanced object detection, we propose a Harmonic loss to
harmonize the optimization of classification branch and localization branch.
The Harmonic loss enables these two branches to supervise and promote each
other during training, thereby producing consistent predictions with high
co-occurrence of top classification and localization in the inference phase.
Furthermore, in order to prevent the localization loss from being dominated by
outliers during training phase, a Harmonic IoU loss is proposed to harmonize
the weight of the localization loss of different IoU-level samples.
Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks PASCAL VOC and MS COCO demonstrate the
generality and effectiveness of our model for facilitating existing object
detectors to state-of-the-art accuracy.

phases of Si through e.g. a repulsive 3-body term that favors the ideal
tetrahedral angle. Along the vapor-liquid coexistence, between 3000K and 6000K,
the densities for the two coexisting phases are found to vary significantly (by
$5$ orders of magnitude for the vapor and by up to 25% for the liquid) and to
provide a stringent test of the models. Transitions from vapor to liquid are
predicted to occur for chemical potentials that are $10-15$% higher for CMB
models than for QMB models, and a ranking of the force fields is provided by
comparing the predictions for the vapor pressure to the experimental data. QMB
models also reveal the formation of a gap in the electronic density of states
of the coexisting liquid at high temperatures. Subjecting Si to a nanoscopic
confinement has a dramatic effect on the phase diagram, with e.g. at 6000K a
decrease in liquid densities by about 50% for both CMB and QMB models and an
increase in vapor densities between 90% (CMB) and 170% (QMB). The results
presented here provide a full picture of the impact of the strategy (CMB or

identify the cause-effect pairs in models and have been successfully applied to
observational real-world data in order to determine the direction of causal
relationships. Many of these methods require simplifying assumptions, such as
absence of confounding, cycles, and selection bias. Yet in bivariate situations
causal discovery problems remain challenging. One class of such methods, that
also allows tackling the bivariate case, is based on Additive Noise Models
(ANMs). Unfortunately, one aspect of these methods has not received much
attention until now: what is the impact of different noise levels on the
ability of these methods to identify the direction of the causal relationship.
This work aims to bridge this gap with the help of an empirical study. For this
work, we considered bivariate cases, which is the most elementary form of a
causal discovery problem where one needs to decide whether X causes Y or Y
causes X, given joint distributions of two variables X, Y. Furthermore, two
specific methods have been selected, \textit{Regression with Subsequent
Independence Test} and \textit{Identification using Conditional Variances},
which have been tested with an exhaustive range of ANMs where the additive
noises' levels gradually change from 1% to 10000% of the causes' noise level
(the latter remains fixed). Additionally, the experiments in this work consider
several different types of distributions as well as linear and non-linear ANMs.
The results of the experiments show that these methods can fail to capture the
true causal direction for some levels of noise.

scales with dust like matter, a minimally coupled Galileon field and radiation.
We use the mechanical approach. Therefore, the peculiar velocities of the
inhomogeneities as well as the fluctuations of the other perfect fluids can be
considered nonrelativistic. Such fluids are said to be coupled because they are
concentrated around the inhomogeneities. We investigate the conditions under
which the physical Galileon field, i.e. compatible with results of the latest
gravitational wave experiments GW150914, GW151226, GW170104, GW170814, GW170817
and GW170608, can become coupled. We know that at the background level coupled
scalar fields behave as a two-component perfect fluids: one which mimics a
network of frustrated cosmic string and an another one which corresponds to an
effective cosmological constant. We found a correction for the Galileon field,
which behaves like a matter component.

(ERI) tensor rapidly becomes the bottleneck in terms of memory and disk space.
When an external finite magnetic field is employed, this problem becomes even
more pronounced because of the reduced permutational symmetry and the need to
work with complex integrals and wave-function parameters. One way to alleviate
the problem is to employ a Cholesky decomposition (CD) to the complex ERIs over
gauge-including atomic orbitals. The CD scheme establishes favourable
compression rates by selectively discarding linearly dependent product
densities from the chosen basis set while maintaining a rigorous and robust
error control. This error control constitutes the main advantage over
conceptually similar methods such as density fitting which rely on employing
pre-defined auxiliary basis sets. We implemented the use of the CD in the
framework of finite-field (ff) Hartree-Fock and ff second-order M{\o}ller
Plesset perturbation theory. Our work demonstrates that the CD compression
rates are particularly beneficial in calculations in the presence of a finite
magnetic field. The ff-CD-MP2 scheme enables the correlated treatment of
systems with more than 2000 basis functions in strong magnetic fields within a
reasonable time span.

embedding learning but also memory costly. Existing methods that attempt to
resolve these problems, either rule-based or neural architecture search

They are also not flexible in embedding size selection or in warm-start-based
applications. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective embedding size
selection scheme. Specifically, we design an Adaptively-Masked Twins-based

to mask the undesired dimensions for each embedding vector. The mask vector
brings flexibility in selecting the dimensions and the proposed layer can be
easily added to either untrained or trained DLRMs. Extensive experimental
evaluations show that the proposed scheme outperforms competitive baselines on
all the benchmark tasks, and is also memory-efficient, saving 60\% memory usage
without compromising any performance metrics.

Networks (CNNs) have become popular for vision-based tasks. It is generally
admirable to have larger-sized datasets for higher network training accuracies.
However, the impact of dataset quality has not to be involved. It is reasonable
to assume the near-duplicate images exist in the datasets. For instance, the
Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset having cropped house plate digits from
0 to 9 are likely to have repetitive digits from the same/similar house plates.
Redundant images may take up a certain portion of the dataset without
consciousness. While contributing little to no accuracy improvement for the
CNNs training, these duplicated images unnecessarily pose extra resource and
computation consumption. To this end, this paper proposes a framework to assess
the impact of the near-duplicate images on CNN training performance, called
CE-Dedup. Specifically, CE-Dedup associates a hashing-based image deduplication
approach with downstream CNNs-based image classification tasks. CE-Dedup
balances the tradeoff between a large deduplication ratio and a stable accuracy
by adjusting the deduplication threshold. The effectiveness of CE-Dedup is
validated through extensive experiments on well-known CNN benchmarks. On one
hand, while maintaining the same validation accuracy, CE-Dedup can reduce the

accuracy drop (by 5%), CE-Dedup can trim the dataset size by 75%.

logic since the dissipation of the kinetic energy of the surface screening
