  For a given $1$-Lipschitz map $u\colon\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$, $m\leq

set of Lebesgue measure zero, into maximal closed convex sets such that

  We consider a disintegration, with respect to this partition, of a
log-concave measure. We prove that for almost every set of the partition of

is proven also in the context of the curvature-dimension condition for weighted
Riemannian manifolds. This partially confirms a conjecture of Klartag.

formulation of linear prediction for speech dereverberation, for speaker
separation in reverberant conditions. The key idea is to first use a deep
neural network (DNN) to estimate the direct-path signal of each speaker, and
then identify delayed and decayed copies of the estimated direct-path signal.
Such copies are likely due to reverberation, and can be directly removed for
dereverberation or used as extra features for another DNN to perform better
dereverberation and separation. To identify such copies, we solve a linear
regression problem per frequency efficiently in the time-frequency (T-F) domain
to estimate the underlying room impulse response (RIR). In the multi-channel
extension, we perform minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR)
beamforming on the outputs of convolutive prediction. The beamforming and
dereverberation results are used as extra features for a second DNN to perform
better separation and dereverberation. State-of-the-art results are obtained on
the SMS-WSJ corpus.

subject to a torque-free condition are both considered to evaluate the
importance of spin-induced effects. The separation distance between the sphere
and wall is varied from values at which the wall influence is weak down to gaps
of half the sphere radius. The Reynolds number based on the sphere diameter and
relative velocity with respect to the ambient fluid spans the range $0.1-250$,
and the relative shear rate defined as the ratio of the shear-induced velocity
variation across the sphere to the relative velocity is varied from $-0.5$ to
$+0.5$, so that the sphere either leads the fluid or lags behind it. The

analyzed qualitatively by examining the flow structure, especially the spanwise

salient humans, ignoring the unspecified others in the video. Few studies have
focused on segmenting and tracking all humans in a complex video, including
pedestrians and humans of other states (e.g., seated, riding, or occluded). In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, abbreviated as HVISNet, that segments
and tracks all presented people in given videos based on a one-stage detector.
To better evaluate complex scenes, we offer a new benchmark called HVIS (Human
Video Instance Segmentation), which comprises 1447 human instance masks in 805
high-resolution videos in diverse scenes. Extensive experiments show that our
proposed HVISNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy
at a real-time inference speed (30 FPS), especially on complex video scenes. We
also notice that using the center of the bounding box to distinguish different
individuals severely deteriorates the segmentation accuracy, especially in
heavily occluded conditions. This common phenomenon is referred to as the
ambiguous positive samples problem. To alleviate this problem, we propose a
mechanism named Inner Center Sampling to improve the accuracy of instance
segmentation. Such a plug-and-play inner center sampling mechanism can be
incorporated in any instance segmentation models based on a one-stage detector
to improve the performance. In particular, it gains 4.1 mAP improvement on the
state-of-the-art method in the case of occluded humans. Code and data are
available at https://github.com/IIGROUP/HVISNet.

  Camera-IMU System","11 pages, 9 figures",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The rolling shutter (RS) mechanism is widely used by consumer-grade cameras,
which are essential parts in smartphones and autonomous vehicles. The RS effect
leads to image distortion upon relative motion between a camera and the scene.
This effect needs to be considered in video stabilization, structure from
motion, and vision-aided odometry, for which recent studies have improved
earlier global shutter (GS) methods by accounting for the RS effect. However,
it is still unclear how the RS affects spatiotemporal calibration of the camera
in a sensor assembly, which is crucial to good performance in aforementioned
applications.
  This work takes the camera-IMU system as an example and looks into the RS
effect on its spatiotemporal calibration. To this end, we develop a calibration
method for a RS-camera-IMU system with continuous-time B-splines by using a
calibration target. Unlike in calibrating GS cameras, every observation of a
landmark on the target has a unique camera pose fitted by continuous-time
B-splines. With simulated data generated from four sets of public calibration
data, we show that RS can noticeably affect the extrinsic parameters, causing
errors about 1$^\circ$ in orientation and 2 $cm$ in translation with a RS
setting as in common smartphone cameras. With real data collected by two
industrial camera-IMU systems, we find that considering the RS effect gives
more accurate and consistent spatiotemporal calibration. Moreover, our method
also accurately calibrates the inter-line delay of the RS. The code for
simulation and calibration is publicly available.

The recent estimates of the 3D shape of the M/Xe-type triple
asteroid system (216) Kleopatra indicated a density of 5 g.cm$^{-3}$. Such a
high density implies a high metal content and a low porosity which is not easy
to reconcile with its peculiar dumbbell shape. Aims. Given the unprecedented
angular resolution of the VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL camera, we aim to constrain the
mass and the shape of Kleopatra with high accuracy, hence its density. Methods.
We combined our new VLT/SPHERE observations of Kleopatra recorded in 2017 and
2018 with archival data, as well as lightcurve, occultation, and delay-Doppler
images, to derive its 3D shape model using two different algorithms (ADAM,
MPCD). Furthermore, an N-body dynamical model allowed us to retrieve the
orbital elements of the two moons as explained in the accompanying paper.
Results. The shape of Kleopatra is very close to an equilibrium dumbbell figure
with two lobes and a thick neck. Its volume equivalent diameter
(118.75$\pm$1.40) km and mass (2.97$\pm$0.32) 10$^{18}$ kg imply a bulk density
of (3.38$\pm$0.50) g cm$^{-3}$. Such a low density for a supposedly metal-rich
body indicates a substantial porosity within the primary. This porous structure
along with its near-equilibrium shape is compatible with a formation scenario
including a giant impact followed by reaccumulation. Kleopatra's current
rotation period and dumbbell shape imply that it is in a critically rotating
state. The low effective gravity along the equator of the body, together with
the equatorial orbits of the moons and possibly rubble-pile structure, opens
the possibility that the moons formed via mass shedding. Conclusions. Kleopatra
is a puzzling multiple system due to the unique characteristics of the primary.
It deserves particular attention in the future, with the Extremely Large
Telescopes and possibly a dedicated space mission.

group known as the Weyl group, whose terms involve the $q$-analog of Kostant's
partition function. The $q$-analog of the partition function is a
polynomial-valued function defined by $\wp_q(\xi)=\sum_{i=0}^k c_i q^i$, where
$c_i$ is the number of ways the weight $\xi$ can be written as a sum of exactly
$i$ positive roots of a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$. The evaluation of the
$q$-multiplicity formula at $q = 1$ recovers the multiplicity of a weight in an
irreducible highest weight representation of $\mathfrak{g}$. In this paper, we
specialize to the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sp}_6(\mathbb{C})$ and we provide a
closed formula for the $q$-analog of Kostant's partition function, which
extends recent results of Shahi, Refaghat, and Marefat. We also describe the
supporting sets of the multiplicity formula (known as the Weyl alternation sets
of $\mathfrak{sp}_6(\mathbb{C})$), and use these results to provide a closed
formula for the $q$-multiplicity for any pair of dominant integral weights of

efficiently estimate the nested integrations of the expected information gain.
The Gaussian approximation and associated importance sampling have been shown
to be effective at reducing the numerical costs. However, they may fail due to
the non-negligible biases and the numerical instabilities. A new approach is
developed to compute the expected information gain, when the posterior
distribution is multimodal - a situation previously ignored by the methods
aiming at accelerating the nested numerical integrations. Specifically, the
posterior distribution is approximated using a mixture distribution constructed
by multiple runs of global search for the modes and weighted local Laplace
approximations. Under any given probability of capturing all the modes, we
provide an estimation of the number of runs of searches, which is dimension
independent. It is shown that the novel global-local multimodal approach can be
significantly more accurate and more efficient than the other existing
approaches, especially when the number of modes is large. The methods can be
applied to the designs of experiments with both calibrated and uncalibrated
observation noises.

deg$^2$ area across the main body of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), using
the near-infrared photometry from the VISTA survey of the Magellanic Clouds

and a low sensitivity to the interstellar extinction. 756 subregions of size
$0.125$ deg$^2$ -- corresponding to projected sizes of about
$296\times322\,\mathrm{pc}^{2}$ in the LMC -- are analysed. The resulting SFH
maps, with typical resolution of $0.2$--$0.3$ dex in logarithm of age, reveal
main features in the LMC disc at different ages: the patchy star formation at
recent ages, the concentration of star formation on three spiral arms and on
the Bar up to ages of $\sim\!1.6$ Gyr, and the wider and smoother distribution
of older populations. The period of most intense star formation occurred
roughly between 4 and 0.5 Gyr ago, at rates of
$\sim\!0.3\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. We compare young and old star
formation rates with the observed numbers of RR Lyrae and Cepheids. We also
derive a mean extinction and mean distance for every subregion, and the plane
that best describes the spatial distribution of the mean distances. Our results
cover an area about 50 per cent larger than the classical SFH maps derived from
optical data by Harris & Zaritsky (2009). Main differences with respect to
those maps are lower star formation rates at young ages, and a main peak of
star formation being identified at ages slightly younger than $1$ Gyr.

  in Mobile Edge Networks",,,,,"cs.DC cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Securing necessary resources for edge computing processes via effective
resource trading becomes a critical technique in supporting
computation-intensive mobile applications. Conventional onsite spot trading
could facilitate this paradigm with proper incentives, which, however, incurs
excessive decision-making latency/energy consumption, and further leads to
underutilization of dynamic resources. Motivated by this, a hybrid market
unifying futures and spot is proposed to facilitate resource trading among an
edge server (seller) and multiple smart devices (buyers) by encouraging some
buyers to sign a forward contract with seller in advance, while leaving the
remaining buyers to compete for available resources with spot trading.
Specifically, overbooking is adopted to achieve substantial utilization and
profit advantages owing to dynamic resource demands. By integrating overbooking
into futures market, mutually beneficial and risk-tolerable forward contracts
with appropriate overbooking rate can be achieved relying on analyzing
historical statistics associated with future resource demand and communication
quality, which are determined by an alternative optimization-based negotiation
scheme. Besides, spot trading problem is studied via considering
uniform/differential pricing rules, for which two bilateral negotiation schemes
are proposed by addressing both non-convex optimization and knapsack problems.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism achieves mutually
beneficial players' utilities, while outperforming baseline methods on critical
indicators, e.g., decision-making latency, resource usage, etc.

B), we systematically assess robustness of patch attacks to 3D position and
orientation for various conditions; in particular, we conduct a sensitivity
analysis which provides important qualitative insights into attack
effectiveness as a function of the 3D pose of a patch relative to the camera
(rotation, translation) and sets forth some properties for patch attack 3D
invariance; and C), we draw novel qualitative conclusions including: 1) we
demonstrate that for some 3D transformations, namely rotation and loom,
increasing the training distribution support yields an increase in patch
success over the full range at test time. 2) We provide new insights into the
existence of a fundamental cutoff limit in patch attack effectiveness that
depends on the extent of out-of-plane rotation angles. These findings should
collectively guide future design of 3D patch attacks and defenses.

contributions, which is accomplished by constructing them using the integrity
bases and invariants of VGT. The developed models can be expressed using the
extended Tensor Basis Neural Network (TBNN). Physical constraints, such as
Galilean invariance, rotational invariance, and incompressibility condition,
are thus embedded in the models explicitly. Our PIML models are trained on the
Lagrangian data from a high-Reynolds number Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS).
To validate the results, we perform a comprehensive out-of-sample test. We
observe that the PIML model provides an improved representation for the
magnitude and orientation of the small-scale pressure Hessian contributions.
Statistics of the flow, as indicated by the joint PDF of second and third
invariants of the VGT, show good agreement with the ""ground-truth"" DNS data. A
number of other important features describing the structure of HIT are
reproduced by the model successfully. We have also identified challenges in
modeling inertial range dynamics, which indicates that a richer modeling
strategy is required. This helps us identify important directions for future
research, in particular towards including inertial range geometry into TBNN.

inflexion points, exceptional points at band-edges, and complex modal
transitions in leaky-wave structures. We then apply these concepts to the
important area of thermal photonics, and provide the first theoretical

  Approach","arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1607.06339",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We provide a complete taxonomic characterization of robust hierarchical
clustering methods for directed networks following an axiomatic approach. We
begin by introducing three practical properties associated with the notion of
robustness in hierarchical clustering: linear scale preservation, stability,
and excisiveness. Linear scale preservation enforces imperviousness to change
in units of measure whereas stability ensures that a bounded perturbation in
the input network entails a bounded perturbation in the clustering output.
Excisiveness refers to the local consistency of the clustering outcome.
Algorithmically, excisiveness implies that we can reduce computational
complexity by only clustering a subset of our data while theoretically
guaranteeing that the same hierarchical outcome would be observed when
clustering the whole dataset. In parallel to these three properties, we
introduce the concept of representability, a generative model for describing
clustering methods through the specification of their action on a collection of
networks. Our main result is to leverage this generative model to give a
precise characterization of all robust -- i.e., excisive, linear scale
preserving, and stable -- hierarchical clustering methods for directed
networks. We also address the implementation of our methods and describe an
application to real data.

or more physical subsystems when the coupling strength between subsystems
exceeds the relaxation rate. The relaxation arises due to the interaction of
the system with environment. For this reason, it is usually believed that the
enhancement of the interaction with environment inevitably leads to a
transition of the system from the strong to weak coupling regime. In this
paper, we refute this common opinion. We demonstrate the interaction of the
coupled system with environment induces an additional coupling between the
subsystems that contribute to retention the system in the strong coupling
regime. We show that the environmental-induced coupling strength is
proportional to the product of the Rabi coupling strength by the gradient of
the density of states of the reservoir. There is a critical Rabi coupling
strength above which the environmental-induced coupling ensures that the system
remains in the strong coupling regime at any relaxation rate. In this case, the
strong coupling regime takes place even when the relaxation rate is
significantly above the Rabi coupling strength between the subsystems. The
critical coupling depends on the gradient of the reservoir density of states.
We demonstrate that managing this gradient can serve as an additional tool to
control the properties of the coupled systems.

capability of BloomNet by evaluating it on different distributions which our

distortions survive in the metallic phase of some materials, there is a desire
to create devices that are both switchable and take advantage of the novel
functionalities afforded by polar interfaces. In this work, we explore a simple
model for such an interface and demonstrate a mechanism by which a metallic
ferroelectric substrate may be switched by a bias voltage. This finding is in
contrast to the reasonable expectation that hysteresis is prevented by
screening of external fields in ferroelectric metals. Instead, the electron gas
binds to polarization gradients to form a compensated state. Uncompensated
electrons, which may screen external fields, are generated either when the
electron density exceeds the ferroelectric polarization or when the bias
voltage exceeds a ""spillover"" threshold. We propose that switchable thin films
may be optimized by choosing an electron density that is slightly less than the
lattice polarization. In addition to the high-polarization states, we find that
thin metallic films also have a low-polarization state with average
polarization near zero. Unlike in insulating films, where the polarization is
small everywhere in this state, the low-polarization state in the metallic
films consists of two head-to-head domains of opposite polarization. This
domain formation is enabled by the screening of depolarizing fields by the

DALL-E, GPT-3) that are trained on broad data at scale and are adaptable to a
wide range of downstream tasks. We call these models foundation models to
underscore their critically central yet incomplete character. This report
provides a thorough account of the opportunities and risks of foundation
models, ranging from their capabilities (e.g., language, vision, robotics,
reasoning, human interaction) and technical principles(e.g., model
architectures, training procedures, data, systems, security, evaluation,
theory) to their applications (e.g., law, healthcare, education) and societal
impact (e.g., inequity, misuse, economic and environmental impact, legal and
ethical considerations). Though foundation models are based on standard deep
learning and transfer learning, their scale results in new emergent
capabilities,and their effectiveness across so many tasks incentivizes
homogenization. Homogenization provides powerful leverage but demands caution,
as the defects of the foundation model are inherited by all the adapted models
downstream. Despite the impending widespread deployment of foundation models,
we currently lack a clear understanding of how they work, when they fail, and
what they are even capable of due to their emergent properties. To tackle these
questions, we believe much of the critical research on foundation models will
require deep interdisciplinary collaboration commensurate with their
fundamentally sociotechnical nature.

whether the system exhibits CST or DST. A second is that the stress per

at the onset of DST; in CST, the difference is mild.

emitted from binary black hole (BBH) mergers at redshifts $z\gtrsim 30$, where
the formation of astrophysical black holes is unlikely. Future ground-based GW
detectors, Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, will be able to observe
equal-mass BBH mergers with total mass of $\mathcal{O}(10-100)~M_{\odot}$ at
such distances. In this work, we investigate whether the redshift measurement
of a single BBH source can be precise enough to establish its primordial
origin. We simulate BBHs of different masses, mass ratios and orbital
orientations. We show that for BBHs with total masses between $20~M_{\odot}$

network made of one Einstein Telescope and one 40-km Cosmic Explorer in the US
measures $z>30$ at larger than 90\% credibility for roughly half of the sources
than the larger network. We then assess the dependence of this result on the
Bayesian redshift priors used for the analysis, specifically on the relative
abundance of the BBH mergers originated from the first stars, and the
primordial BBH mergers.

given that the localization uncertainties of events in LIGO and Virgo's third
observing run, O3, were much larger than predicted. We explain this by showing
that improvements in data analysis that now allow LIGO/Virgo to detect weaker
and hence more poorly localized events have increased the overall number of
detections, of which well-localized, gold-plated events make up a smaller
proportion overall. We present simulations of the next two LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA

non-Gaussian, and this non-Gaussianity encodes important information about this
era. The bispectrum is the lowest order statistic able to capture this inherent
non-Gaussianity. Here we are the first to demonstrate that bispectra for large
and intermediate length scales and for all unique $k$-triangle shapes provide
tighter constraints on the EoR parameters compared to the power spectrum or the
bispectra for a limited number of shapes of $k$-triangles. We use the Bayesian
inference technique to constrain EoR parameters. We have also developed an
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based emulator for the EoR 21-cm power spectrum
and bispectrum which we use to remarkably speed up our parameter inference
pipeline. Here we have considered the sample variance and the system noise
uncertainties corresponding to $1000$ hrs of SKA-Low observations for
estimating errors in the signal statistics. We find that using all unique
$k$-triangle bispectra improves the constraints on parameters by a factor of
$2-4$ (depending on the stage of reionization) over the constraints that are

the theory of core-collapse supernova (CCSN). Despite the potentially
significant impact on CCSN dynamics, it is usually neglected in numerical
models of CCSN because of the formidable technical difficulties of
self-consistently incorporating this physics. In this paper, we investigate the
prospects for the occurrence of fast flavor conversion by diagnosing electron
neutrino lepton number (ELN) crossing in more than a dozen state-of-the-art
three-dimensional CCSN models. ELN crossings is a necessary condition for
triggering flavor conversion. Although only zeroth and first angular moments
are available from the simulations, our new method enables us to look into the
angular distributions of neutrinos in momentum space and provide accurate
insight into ELN crossings. Our analysis suggests that fast flavor conversion
generally occurs in the post-shock region of CCSNe, and that explosive models
provide more favorable conditions for the flavor conversion than failed CCSNe.
We also find that there are both common and progenitor-dependent
characteristics. Classifying ELN crossings into two types, we analyze the
generation mechanism of each case by scrutinizing the neutrino radiation field
and matter interactions. We find key ingredients of CCSN dynamics driving the
ELN crossings: proto-neutron star (PNS) convection, asymmetric neutrino
emission, neutrino absorptions and scatterings. This study suggests that we
need to accommodate fast flavor conversions in realistic CCSN models.

produced the experiment's first upper limits on the power spectrum of 21-cm
fluctuations at z~8 and 10. Here, we use several independent theoretical models
to infer constraints on the intergalactic medium (IGM) and galaxies during the
epoch of reionization (EoR) from these limits. We find that the IGM must have
been heated above the adiabatic cooling threshold by z~8, independent of
uncertainties about the IGM ionization state and the nature of the radio
background. Combining HERA limits with galaxy and EoR observations constrains
the spin temperature of the z~8 neutral IGM to 27 K < T_S < 630 K (2.3 K < T_S
< 640 K) at 68% (95%) confidence. They therefore also place a lower bound on
X-ray heating, a previously unconstrained aspects of early galaxies. For
example, if the CMB dominates the z~8 radio background, the new HERA limits
imply that the first galaxies produced X-rays more efficiently than local ones
(with soft band X-ray luminosities per star formation rate constrained to
L_X/SFR = { 10^40.2, 10^41.9 } erg/s/(M_sun/yr) at 68% confidence), consistent
with expectations of X-ray binaries in low-metallicity environments. The z~10
limits require even earlier heating if dark-matter interactions (e.g., through
millicharges) cool down the hydrogen gas. Using a model in which an extra radio
background is produced by galaxies, we rule out (at 95% confidence) the
combination of high radio and low X-ray luminosities of L_{r,\nu}/SFR > 3.9 x
10^24 W/Hz/(M_sun/yr) and L_X/SFR<10^40 erg/s/(M_sun/yr). The new HERA upper
limits neither support nor disfavor a cosmological interpretation of the recent

stations spread across Europe. With baselines of up to ~2,000 km, LOFAR has the
unique capability of achieving sub-arcsecond resolution at frequencies below
200 MHz, although this is technically and logistically challenging. Here we
present a calibration strategy that builds on previous high-resolution work
with LOFAR. We give an overview of the calibration strategy and discuss the
special challenges inherent to enacting high-resolution imaging with LOFAR, and
describe the pipeline, which is publicly available, in detail. We demonstrate
the calibration strategy by using the pipeline on P205+55, a typical LOFAR
Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) pointing. We perform in-field delay calibration,
solution referencing to other calibrators, self-calibration, and imaging of
example directions of interest in the field. For this specific field and these
ionospheric conditions, dispersive delay solutions can be transferred between
calibrators up to ~1.5 degrees away, while phase solution transferral works
well over 1 degree. We demonstrate a check of the astrometry and flux density
scale. Imaging in 17 directions, the restoring beam is typically 0.3"" x 0.2""
although this varies slightly over the entire 5 square degree field of view. We
achieve ~80 to 300 $\mu$Jy/bm image rms noise, which is dependent on the
distance from the phase centre; typical values are ~90 $\mu$Jy/bm for the 8
hour observation with 48 MHz of bandwidth. Seventy percent of processed sources
are detected, and from this we estimate that we should be able to image ~900
sources per LoTSS pointing. This equates to ~3 million sources in the northern
sky, which LoTSS will entirely cover in the next several years. Future
optimisation of the calibration strategy for efficient post-processing of LoTSS
at high resolution (LoTSS-HR) makes this estimate a lower limit.

conducted between 2014 and 2019 in order to obtain a set of suitable
calibrators for the LOFAR array. In this paper we present the complete survey,
building on the preliminary analysis published in 2016 which covered
approximately half the survey area. The final catalogue consists of 30006
observations of 24713 sources in the northern sky, selected for a combination
of high low-frequency radio flux density and flat spectral index using existing
surveys (WENSS, NVSS, VLSS, and MSSS). Approximately one calibrator per square
degree, suitable for calibration of $\geq$ 200 km baselines is identified by
the detection of compact flux density, for declinations north of 30 degrees and
away from the Galactic plane, with a considerably lower density south of this
point due to relative difficulty in selecting flat-spectrum candidate sources
in this area of the sky. Use of the VLBA calibrator list, together with
statistical arguments by comparison with flux densities from lower-resolution
catalogues, allow us to establish a rough flux density scale for the LBCS
observations, so that LBCS statistics can be used to estimate compact flux
densities on scales between 300 mas and 2 arcsec, for sources observed in the
survey. The LBCS can be used to assess the structures of point sources in
lower-resolution surveys, with significant reductions in the degree of
coherence in these sources on scales between 2 arcsec and 300 mas. The LBCS
survey sources show a greater incidence of compact flux density in quasars than
in radio galaxies, consistent with unified schemes of radio sources. Comparison
with samples of sources from interplanetary scintillation (IPS) studies with
the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) shows consistent patterns of detection of
compact structure in sources observed both interferometrically with LOFAR and
using IPS.

the origin of the rings within the lobes of Hercules A, and test whether their
properties are best described by a shock model, where shock waves are produced
by the jet propagating in the radio lobe, or by an inner-lobe model, where the
rings are formed by decelerated jetted plasma. From spectral index mapping our
large frequency coverage reveals that the curvature of the different ring
spectra increases with distance away from the central active galactic nucleus.
We demonstrate that the spectral shape of the rings is consistent with
synchrotron aging, which speaks in favor of an inner-lobe model where the rings

has been discovered about this historically notable source, its low-frequency

traditionally lacked the resolution required to explore small-scale structures
that are key to understanding the processes that result in the observed
emission. In this paper we use the first sub-arcsecond images of 3C273 at MHz

LOFAR's international stations, we produce $0.31 \times 0.21$ arcsec images of

bulk speed and inclination angle of the jets, and look for evidence of the
elusive counter-jet at 150 MHz. Using ancillary data at GHz frequencies, we fit
free-free absorption (FFA) and synchrotron self-absorption (SSA) models to
determine their validity in explaining the observed spectra. The images
presented display for the first time that robust, high-fidelity imaging of
low-declination complex sources is now possible with the LOFAR international
baselines. We show that the main small-scale structures of 3C273 match those
seen at higher frequencies and that absorption is present in the observed
emission. We determine the kinetic power of the jet to be in the range of $3.5
\times 10^{43}$ - $1.5 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ which agrees with estimates
made using higher frequency observations. We derive lower limits for the bulk
speed and Lorentz factor of $\beta \gtrsim 0.55$ and $\Gamma \geq 1.2$
respectively. The counter-jet remains undetected at $150$ MHz, placing a limit
on the peak brightness of $S_\mathrm{cj\_150} < 40$ mJy beam$^{-1}$.

that exhibit restarted radio jets. These restarted jets can interact with their
environment, leaving signatures on the radio spectral energy distribution.
Tracing these signatures requires resolved spectral index measurements over a
broad frequency range including low frequencies. We present such a study for
the radio galaxy 3C 293. Using the International LOFAR telescope (ILT) we
probed spatial scales as fine as ~0.2"" at 144 MHz, and to constrain the
spectrum we combined these data with Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer
Network (MERLIN) and Very Large Array (VLA) archival data. In the inner lobes
(~2 kpc), we detect the presence of a spectral turnover that peaks at ~225 MHz
and is most likely caused by free-free absorption from the rich surrounding
medium. We confirm that these inner lobes are part of a jet-dominated young
radio source (spectral age $\lesssim$0.17 Myr), which is strongly interacting
with the rich interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy. The outer lobes
(~100 kpc) have a spectral index of $\alpha$~0.6-0.8 from 144-4850 MHz with a
remarkably uniform spatial distribution and only mild spectral curvature
($\Delta\alpha\lesssim$ 0.2). We propose that intermittent fuelling and jet
flow disruptions are powering the mechanisms that keep the spectral index in
the outer lobes from steepening and maintain the spatial uniformity of the
spectral index. Overall, it appears that 3C 293 has gone through multiple (two
to three) epochs of activity. This study adds 3C 293 to the new sub-group of
restarted galaxies with short interruption time periods. This is the first time
a spatially resolved study simultaneously studies a young source as well as the
older outer lobes at such low frequencies. This illustrates the potential of
the ILT to expand such studies to a larger sample of radio galaxies.

distant galaxies, the $\alpha-z$ relation, but the reason for this relation is
an open question. The spatial distribution of spectra in high-z radio sources
can be used to study this relation, and low-frequency observations are
particularly important in understanding the particle acceleration and injection
mechanisms. However, the small angular sizes of high-z sources together with
the inherently low resolution of low-frequency radio telescopes until now has
prevented high angular resolution low-frequency observations of distant
objects. Here we present subarcsecond observations of a $z = 2.4$ radio galaxy
at frequencies between $121$ MHz and $166$ MHz. We measure the spatial
distribution of spectra, and discuss the implications for models of the

the \textit{International LOFAR Telescope} (ILT) with a range of baselines up
to $1300\ \mathrm{km}$. At the central frequency of $143$ MHz we achieve an

\textit{Very Large Array} (VLA) data we study the spectral index distribution
across 4C 43.15 between $55\ \mathrm{MHz}$ and $8.4\ \mathrm{GHz}$ at
resolutions of $0.4''$ and $0.9''$. With a magnetic field strength of $B = 5.2$

surface brightness sensitivity of our LOFAR observations ($\sim$100
$\mu$Jy/beam) allowed us to detect all of the nuclear components detected at
higher frequencies, as well as the extended steep-spectrum emission surrounding
the nuclei. We obtained spatially resolved, two-point spectral index maps for
the whole galaxy: the compact nuclei show relatively flat spectra, while the
extended, diffuse component shows a steep spectrum. We fitted the radio SED of
the nuclear regions using two different models: a continuous free-free medium
model and a clumpy model. The continuous model can explain the SED of the
nuclei assuming a population of relativistic electrons subjected to
synchrotron, bremsstrahlung, and ionization losses. The clumpy model fits
assuming relativistic electrons with negligible energy losses, and thermal
fractions that are more typical of star-forming galaxies than those required
for the continuous model. Our results confirm the usefulness of combining
spatially resolved radio imaging at both MHz and GHz frequencies to
characterize in detail the radio emission properties of LIRGs from the central

In the case of MG 0751+2716, lens modelling is used to derive a size estimate
of around 2 kpc for the low-frequency source, which is consistent with a
previous 27.4 GHz study in the radio continuum with Karl G. Jansky Very Large
Array (VLA). This consistency implies that the low-frequency radio source is
cospatial with the core-jet structure that forms the radio structure at higher
frequencies, and no significant lobe emission or further components associated
with star formation are detected within the magnified region of the lens. CLASS
B1600+434 is a two-image lens where one of the images passes through the
edge-on spiral lensing galaxy, and the low radio frequency allows us to derive
limits on propagation effects, namely scattering, in the lensing galaxy. The
observed flux density ratio of the two lensed images is 1.19 +/- 0.04 at an
observed frequency of 150 MHz. The widths of the two images give an upper limit
of 0.035 kpc m^-20/3 on the integrated scattering column through the galaxy at
a distance approximately 1 kpc above its plane, under the assumption that image
A is not affected by scattering. This is relatively small compared to limits
derived through very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) studies of
differential scattering in lens systems. These observations demonstrate that
LOFAR is an excellent instrument for studying gravitational lenses. We also

integrated radio spectral energy distribution (SED) from 132 MHz to 15 GHz.
However, spatially resolved spectral studies have been limited due to a lack of
high resolution images at low radio frequencies. These frequencies are crucial
for measuring absorption processes, and anchoring the overall spectral
modelling of the radio SED. In this paper, we use International LOFAR
(LOw-Frequency ARray) Telescope (ILT) observations of 3C295 to study its
spatially resolved spectral properties with sub-arcsecond resolution at 132
MHz. Combining our new 132 MHz observation with archival data at 1.6 GHz, 4.8
GHz, and 15 GHz, we are able to carry out a resolved radio spectral analysis.
The spectral properties of the hotspots provides evidence for low frequency
flattening. In contrast, the spectral shape across the lobes is consistent with
a JP spectral ageing model. Using the integrated spectral information for each
component, we then fit low-frequency absorption models to the hotspots, finding
that both free-free absorption and synchrotron self-absorption models provide a
better fit to the data than a standard power law. Although we can say there is
low-frequency absorption present in the hotspots of 3C295, future observations
with the Low Band Antenna of the ILT at 55 MHz may allow us to distinguish the
type of absorption.

principle ingredients of the continuum model are a nonlocal term and Q-Wiener
process describing the interactions among the particles in the network and
stochastic forcing respectively. The network connectivity is given by a square
integrable function called a graphon.
  We prove that the initial value problem for the continuum model is
well-posed. Further, we construct a semidiscrete (discrete in space and
continuous in time) and a fully discrete schemes for the nonlocal model. The
former is obtained by a discontinuous Galerkin method and the latter is based
on further discretizing time using the Euler-Maruyama method. We prove
convergence and estimate the rate of convergence in each case. For the
semidiscrete scheme, the rate of convergence estimate is expressed in terms of
the regularity of the graphon, Q-Wiener process, and the initial data. We work
in generalized Lipschitz spaces, which allows to treat models with data of
lower regularity. This is important for applications as many interesting types
of connectivity including small-world and power-law are expressed by graphons
that are not smooth. The error analysis of the fully discrete scheme, on the
other hand, reveals that for some models common in applied science, one has a
higher speed of convergence than that predicted by the standard estimates for
the Euler-Maruyama method. The rate of convergence analysis is supplemented
with detailed numerical experiments, which are consistent with our analytical
results.

environment, followed by education and then crime, were highly correlated with
higher opioid risk. We also explored the change in these correlations over the

discovered that, as the epidemic has shifted from legal (i.e., prescription
opioids) to illegal (e.g.,heroin and fentanyl) drugs in recent years, the
correlation of environment, crime and health related variables with the opioid
risk has increased significantly while the correlation of economic and

the 321.2257 GHz (10(2,9) - 9(3,6)) line detection towards AS 205 is
inconsistent with a normal inner disk temperature structure and that the

vertical mixing continuously sequestering water from the warm surface layers

often requires balancing conflicting objectives. A simple interpretation may be
easier to understand for humans while being less precise in its predictions
vis-a-vis a complex interpretation. Existing methods for synthesizing
interpretations use a single objective function and are often optimized for a
single class of interpretations. In contrast, we provide a more general and
multi-objective synthesis framework that allows users to choose (1) the class
of syntactic templates from which an interpretation should be synthesized, and
(2) quantitative measures on both the correctness and explainability of an
interpretation. For a given black-box, our approach yields a set of
Pareto-optimal interpretations with respect to the correctness and
explainability measures. We show that the underlying multi-objective
optimization problem can be solved via a reduction to quantitative constraint
solving, such as weighted maximum satisfiability. To demonstrate the benefits
of our approach, we have applied it to synthesize interpretations for black-box
neural-network classifiers. Our experiments show that there often exists a rich

  Given a Borel set $A$ in the plane, we study the set of exceptional vantage
points, for which the pinned distance $\Delta_p(A)$ has small dimension, that
is, close to $(\dim A)/2$. We show that if this set has positive dimension,
then it must have very special structure. This result follows from a more
general single-scale nonlinear projection theorem, which says that if
$\phi_1,\phi_2,\phi_3$ are three smooth functions whose associated 3-web has
non-vanishing Blaschke curvature, and if $A$ is a $(\delta,\alpha)_2$-set in
the sense of Katz and Tao, then at least one of the images $\phi_i(A)$ must
have measure much larger than $|A|^{1/2}$, where $|A|$ stands for the measure
of $A$. We prove analogous results for $d$ smooth functions
$\phi_1,\ldots,\phi_d$, whose associated $d$-web is not parallelizable.
  We use similar tools to characterize when bivariate real analytic functions
are ""dimension expanding"" when applied to a Cartesian product: if $P$ is a
bivariate real analytic function, then $P$ is either locally of the form
$h(a(x) + b(y))$, or $P(A,B)$ has dimension at least $\alpha+c$ whenever $A$

quiescent XRBs. Frequent X-ray monitoring of the GC revealed that the 12
non-thermal X-ray sources, as well as four X-ray transients have shown at most
a single outburst over the last two decades. They are distinct from the six
known neutron star LMXBs in the GC, which have all undergone multiple outbursts
with <~ 5 year recurrence time on average. Based on the outburst history data
of the broader population of X-ray transients, we conclude that the 16 sources
represent a population of ~240-630 tightly-bound BH-LMXBs with ~4-12 hour
orbital periods, consistent with the stellar/binary dynamics modelling in the
vicinity of Sgr A*. The distribution of the 16 BH-LMXB candidates is disk-like
(at 87% CL) and aligned with the nuclear star cluster. Our results have
implications for XRB formation and the rate of gravitational wave events in
other galactic nuclei.

to minimize each client's loss using information from all of the clients. We
analyze a linear regression model where, for a given client, we may
theoretically compare the performance of various algorithms in the
high-dimensional asymptotic limit. This asymptotic multi-criterion approach
naturally models the high-dimensional, many-device nature of federated
learning. These tools make fairly precise predictions about the benefits of
personalization and information sharing in federated scenarios -- at least in
our (stylized) model -- including that Federated Averaging with simple client
fine-tuning achieves the same asymptotic risk as the more intricate
meta-learning and proximal-regularized approaches and outperforming Federated
Averaging without personalization. We evaluate these predictions on federated

simulations of a spherical MW halo that recently captured a massive (1.8$\times

may enhance the clustering of orbital poles of objects orbiting the MW. The LMC
deviates the orbital poles of MW dark matter (DM) particles from the
present-day random distribution. Instead, the orbital poles of particles beyond
$R\approx 50$kpc cluster near the present-day orbital pole of the LMC along a
sinusoidal pattern across the sky. The density of orbital poles is enhanced
near the LMC by a factor $\delta \rho_{max}$=30\%(50\%) with respect to
underdense regions, and $\delta \rho_{iso}$=15\%(30\%) relative to the isolated
MW simulation (no LMC) between 50-150 kpc (150-300 kpc). The clustering appears
after the LMC's pericenter ($\approx$ 50 Myr ago, 49 kpc) and lasts for at
least 1 Gyr. Clustering occurs because of three effects: 1) the LMC shifts the
velocity and position of the central density of the MW's halo and disk; 2) the
DM dynamical friction wake and collective response induced by the LMC changes
the kinematics of particles; 3) observations of particles selected within
spatial planes suffer from a bias, such that measuring orbital poles in a great
circle in the sky enhances the probability of their orbital poles being
clustered. This scenario should be ubiquitous in hosts that recently captured a
massive satellite (at least $\approx$ 1:10 mass ratio), causing the clustering
of orbital poles of halo tracers.

imply that the hole's tidally induced multipole moments vanish also. An
obstacle to establishing a link between these statements is that the multipole
moments of individual bodies are not defined in general relativity, when the
bodies are subjected to a mutual gravitational interaction. In a previous
publication [Phys. Rev. D 103, 064023 (2021)] I promoted the view that
individual multipole moments can be defined when the mutual interaction is
sufficiently weak to be described by a post-Newtonian expansion. In this view,
a compact body is perceived far away as a skeletonized post-Newtonian object
with a multipole structure, and the multipole moments can then be related to
the body's Love numbers. I expand on this view, and demonstrate that all
static, tidally induced, mass multipole moments of a nonrotating black hole
vanish to all post-Newtonian orders. The proof rests on a perturbative solution
to the Einstein-Maxwell equations that describes an electrically charged
particle placed in the presence of a charged black hole. The gravitational
attraction between particle and black hole is balanced by electrostatic
repulsion, and the system is in an equilibrium state. The particle provides a
tidal environment to the black hole, and the multipole moments vanish for this
environment. I argue that the vanishing is robust, and applies to all
slowly-varying tidal environments. The black hole's charge can be as small as
desired (though not identically zero); by continuity, the multipole moments of
an electrically neutral black hole will continue to vanish.

as the volatile element responsible for this activity. We conduct theoretical
modeling which indicates that sodium has the potential to sublimate in the
conditions that Phaethon experiences, depending on the mineral phase it is held
in. To test this, we then exposed samples of the carbonaceous chondrite Allende
to varying heating events similar to what would be experienced by low
perihelion asteroids. We measured the change in sodium present in each sample,
and find that the highest temperature samples show a significant loss of sodium
from specific mineral phases over a single heating event, comparable to a day
on the surface of Phaethon. Under specific thermal histories possible for
Phaethon, this outgassing could be sufficient to explain this object's observed
activity. This effect would also be expected to be observed for other

superconductivity of topological insulator (TI)-superconductor (SC) interface
states. In particular we calculate the conductance of lateral heterojunctions
which comprise a TI surface that is only partially covered by a superconducting
material. Interface potentials at the TI-SC interface may lead to a Fermi
velocity and spin texture mismatch between the two regions of the lateral
heterojunction. By enforcing the hermiticity of the total Hamiltonian, we
derive the boundary conditions and calculate the conductance of the structure
in both the normal and superconducting state. The total Andreev conductance is
calculated for both $s$-wave and spin-triplet parent SCs, and for several
examples of nonhelical spin textures which lead to different Fermi surface
mismatches between the two planar regions of the heterojunction. We find that
for spin-triplet SCs, nonzero conductance signatures only appear for certain
combinations of nonhelical spin textures and parent superconducting material.

the electron microscope it is of interest to explore whether defects such as
dislocations or grain boundaries will result in measurable changes of the
spectra. Phonon densities of states were calculated for a set of high angle
grain boundaries in silicon. Since these boundaries are modeled by supercells
with up to 160 atoms, the density of states was calculated by taking the
Fourier transform of the velocity-velocity autocorrelation function from
molecular dynamics simulations based on new supercells doubled in each
direction. In select cases the results were checked on the original supercells
with fewer atoms by comparison with the densities of states obtained by
diagonalizing the dynamical matrix calculated using density functional theory.
Near the core of the grain boundary the height of the optic phonon peak in the
density of states at 60 meV was suppressed relative to features due to acoustic
phonons that are largely unchanged relative to their bulk values. This can be
attributed to the variation in the strength of bonds in grain boundary core
regions where there is a range of bond lengths. It also means that changes in
the density of states intrinsic to grain boundaries are unlikely to affect
thermal conductivity at ambient temperatures, which are most likely dominated
by the scattering of acoustic phonons.

use of single-arm studies to make certain internal drug development and
regulatory decisions, particularly in oncology. Hybrid controlled trials with
real-world data (RWD), in which the control arm is composed of both trial and

shortcomings of both RCTs and single-arm studies in particular situations, such
as when a disease has low prevalence or when the standard of care to be used in

shows early promise. This paper discusses why it may be beneficial to consider
hybrid controlled trials with RWD, what such a design entails, when it may be

supernova-driven galactic winds. The mass-loading of a wind by the cool medium
modifies the bulk velocity, temperature, density, entropy, and abundance
profiles of the hot phase relative to an un-mass-loaded outflow. We provide
general equations and limits for this physics that can be used to infer the
rate of cool gas entrainment from X-ray observations, accounting for
non-spherical expansion. In general, mass-loading flattens the density and
temperature profiles, decreases the velocity and increases the entropy if the
Mach number is above a critical value. We first apply this model to a recent
high-resolution galactic outflow simulation where the mass-loading can be
directly inferred. We show that the temperature, entropy, and composition
profiles are well-matched, providing evidence that this physics sets the bulk
hot gas profiles. We then model the diffuse X-ray emission from the local
starburst M82. The non-spherical (more cylindrical) outflow geometry is
directly taken from the observed X-ray surface brightness profile. These models
imply a total mass-loading rate that is about equal to that injected in the
starburst, $\simeq 10$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, and they predict an asymptotic hot
wind velocity of $\sim 1000\,{\rm km \ s^{-1}}$ that is $\sim1.5-2$ times
smaller than previous predictions. We also show how the observed entropy
profile can be used to constrain the outflow velocity, making predictions for

The simulations start from identical initial conditions and we regulate the

forms a constant density core of similar size and shape for several
combinations of those two parameters. Haloes with cores that are formed due to
SIDM (adiabatic cusp-core transformation) have velocity dispersion profiles
which are closer to isothermal than those of haloes with cores that are formed

increase random motion in the gas at the centre of the galaxy. Simulated
galaxies in haloes with cores that were formed adiabatically are spatially more
extended, with stellar metallicity gradients that are shallower (at late times)
than those of galaxies in other simulations. Such observable properties of the

spin degrees of freedom, leading to unusual transport phenomena of spin and
heat, has been a subject of continuing interests for decades. Despite its
pivotal role in transport processes, the effect of spin-phonon coupling on the
phonon system, especially acoustic phonon properties, has so far been elusive.
By means of inelastic neutron scattering and first-principles calculations,
anomalous scattering spectral intensity from acoustic phonons was identified in
the exemplary collinear antiferromagnetic nickel (II) oxide, unveiling strong
spin-lattice correlations that renormalize the polarization of acoustic phonon.
In particular, a clear magnetic scattering signature of the measured neutron
scattering intensity from acoustic phonons is demonstrated by its momentum
transfer and temperature dependences. The anomalous scattering intensity is
successfully modeled with a modified magneto-vibrational scattering cross
section, suggesting the presence of spin precession driven by phonon. The
renormalization of phonon eigenvector is indicated by the observed
""geometry-forbidden"" neutron scattering intensity from transverse acoustic
phonon. Importantly, the eigenvector renormalization cannot be explained by
magnetostriction but instead, it could result from the coupling between phonon
and local magnetization of ions.

built-in as the extra-space component of the higher dimensional gauge field.
The coupling of $A_y$ with gluons is attributed to the radiatively induced
""Chern-Simons"" (CS) term. We adopt a toy model with some unknown gauge symmetry
U(1)$_X$. The CS term is obtained in two ways: first by a concrete 1-loop
calculation and next by use of the Fujikawa's method to deal with the chiral
anomaly in 4D space-time. The obtained results are identical, which implies
that the radiative correction to the CS term is ""1-loop exact"" and is also free
from UV-divergence even though the theory itself is non-renormalizable. As a
novel feature of this scenario, such obtained CS term is no longer linear in
the field $A_y$ as in the usually discussed CS term in 5D space-time but a
periodic function of $A_y$, since $A_y$ has a physical meaning as the
Wilson-loop phase. We argue how such novel feature of this scenario causes the
modification of the ordinary solutions of the strong CP problem based on the
axion fields.

several unique features, such as programmable all-to-all Ising coupling in the

frequencies than would be seen in actual stars possessing identical interior
structure, due to modelling error near the surface. This asteroseismic ""surface
term"" must be corrected when mode frequencies are used to infer stellar
structure. Subgiants exhibit oscillations of mixed acoustic ($p$-mode) and
gravity ($g$-mode) character, which defy description by the traditional
$p$-mode asymptotic relation. Since nonparametric diagnostics of the surface
term rely on this description, they cannot be applied to subgiants directly. In
Paper I, we generalised such nonparametric methods to mixed modes, and showed
that traditional surface-term corrections only account for mixed-mode coupling
to, at best, first order in a perturbative expansion. Here, we apply those
results, modelling subgiants using asteroseismic data. We demonstrate that, for
grid-based inference of subgiant properties using individual mode frequencies,
neglecting higher-order effects of mode coupling in the surface term results in
significant systematic differences in the inferred stellar masses, and
measurable systematics in other fundamental properties. While these systematics
are smaller than those resulting from other choices of model construction, they
persist for both parametric and nonparametric formulations of the surface term.
This suggests that mode coupling should be fully accounted for when correcting
for the surface term in seismic modelling with mixed modes, irrespective of the
choice of correction used. The inferred properties of subgiants, in particular
masses and ages, also depend on the choice of surface-term correction, in a
different manner from both main-sequence and red giant stars.

phase ramp of opposite signs, which prevents model-based focal plane wavefront
sensing and control strategies in natural light. We thus have to work with a
polarization state than ensures circularly polarized light at the VVC mask.
However, achieving this polarization state can be non trivial if there are
optics that add phase retardance of any kind between the circular polarizer and
the focal plane mask. Here we present the method currently used at the Caltech

learning, where a deep neural network (DNN) is trained to predict the direct
sound from noisy-reverberant speech. This data-driven approach is based on
leveraging prior knowledge of clean speech patterns and seldom explicitly
exploits the linear-filter structure in reverberation, i.e., that reverberation
results from a linear convolution between a room impulse response (RIR) and a
dry source signal. In this work, we propose to exploit this linear-filter
structure within a deep learning based monaural speech dereverberation
framework. The key idea is to first estimate the direct-path signal of the
target speaker using a DNN and then identify signals that are decayed and
delayed copies of the estimated direct-path signal, as these can be reliably
considered as reverberation. They can be either directly removed for
dereverberation, or used as extra features for another DNN to perform better
dereverberation. To identify the copies, we estimate the underlying filter (or
RIR) by efficiently solving a linear regression problem per frequency in the
time-frequency domain. We then modify the proposed algorithm for speaker
separation in reverberant and noisy-reverberant conditions. State-of-the-art
speech dereverberation and speaker separation results are obtained on the
REVERB, SMS-WSJ, and WHAMR! datasets.

propose a learning to defer with uncertainty (LDU) algorithm which identifies
patients for whom diagnostic uncertainty is high and defers them for evaluation
by human experts. LDU was evaluated on the diagnosis of myocardial infarction
(using discharge summaries), the diagnosis of any comorbidities (using
structured data), and the diagnosis of pleural effusion and pneumothorax (using
chest x-rays), and compared with 'learning to defer without uncertainty

the same F1 score as LD but deferred considerably fewer patients (e.g. 36% vs.
69% deferral rate for diagnosing pleural effusion with an F1 score of 0.96).
Furthermore, even when many patients were assigned the wrong diagnosis with
high confidence (e.g. for the diagnosis of any comorbidities) LDU achieved a
17% increase in F1 score, whereas DT was not applicable. Importantly, the
weight of the defer loss in LDU can be easily adjusted to obtain the desired
trade-off between diagnostic accuracy and deferral rate. In conclusion, LDU can
readily augment any existing diagnostic network to reduce the risk of erroneous

within geometry. However, this is hopefully just a first step towards a

compressible wall-bounded turbulent flows to the incompressible law of the wall

successfully collapses, without specific tuning, numerical simulation data from
fully developed channel and pipe flows, and boundary layers with or without
heat transfer. In all these cases, the transformation is successful across the
entire inner layer of the boundary layer (including the viscous sublayer,
buffer layer, and logarithmic layer), recovers the asymptotically exact
near-wall behavior in the viscous sublayer, and is consistent with the near
balance of turbulence production and dissipation in the logarithmic region of
the boundary layer. The performance of the transformation is verified for
compressible wall-bounded flows with edge Mach numbers ranging from 0 to 15 and
friction Reynolds numbers ranging from 200 to 2000. Based on physical

orchestrate many heterogeneous mechatronic components and control multiple

model-driven fashion where abstractions of physical processes called plant
models are co-developed and iteratively refined along with the control code.
Testing such multi-dimensional systems is extremely difficult because often
models might not be accurate, do not correspond accurately with subsequent
refinements, and the software must eventually be tested on the real plant,
especially in safety-critical systems like nuclear plants. This paper proposes
a framework wherein high-level functional requirements are used to
automatically generate test cases for designs at all abstraction levels in the
model-driven engineering process. Requirements are initially specified in
natural language and then analyzed and specified using a formalized ontology.
The requirements ontology is then refined along with controller and plant
models during design and development stages such that test cases can be
generated automatically at any stage. A representative industrial water process
system case study illustrates the strengths of the proposed formalism. The
requirements meta-model proposed by the CESAR European project is used for
requirements engineering while IEC 61131-3 and model-driven concepts are used
in the design and development phases. A tool resulting from the proposed

attention in software testing, especially in mobile application (app) testing

it utilize the diverse testing environments of different crowdworkers faced
with the mobile testing fragmentation problem. However, crowdsourced testing
also brings some problem. The crowdworkers involved are with different
expertise, and they are not professional testers. Therefore, the reports they
may submit are numerous and with uneven quality. App developers have to
distinguish high-quality reports from low-quality ones to help the bug
revealing and fixing. Some crowdworkers would submit inconsistent test reports,
which means the textual descriptions are not focusing on the attached bug
occurring screenshots. Such reports cause the waste on both time and human
resources of app developing and testing.
  To solve such a problem, we propose ReCoDe in this paper, which is designed
to detect the consistency of crowdsourced test reports via deep image-and-text
fusion understanding. First, according to a pre-conducted survey, ReCoDe
classifies the crowdsourced test reports into 10 categories, which covers the
vast majority of reported problems in the test reports. Then, for each category
of bugs, we have distinct processing models. The models have a deep fusion
understanding on both image information and textual descriptions. We also have
conducted an experiment to evaluate ReCoDe, and the results show the

views, we first construct a lightweight neural network to dynamically learn
weights for interpolating neighbouring pixels from input views to synthesize
each pixel of novel views independently. In contrast to the fixed and
content-independent weights employed in the geometry warping operation, the
learned interpolation weights implicitly incorporate the correspondences
between the source and novel views and adapt to different image content
information. Then, we recover the spatial correlation between the independently
synthesized pixels of each novel view by referring to that of input views using
a geometry-based spatial refinement module. We also constrain the angular
correlation between the novel views through a disparity-oriented LF structure
loss. Experimental results on LF datasets with wide baselines show that the
reconstructed LFs achieve much higher PSNR/SSIM and preserve the LF parallax

in the long-time limit, the Dicke state $|S,0\rangle_x$, conditioned upon there

a jump, however, the system evolves probabilistically into one of a finite

metastability are also observed for amorphous carbon films. Finally, the highly

valid if the time series is stationary since the frequency bins are otherwise
not statistically independent. We show that if time series are non-stationary,
the significance of QPOs can be highly overestimated and estimates of the

the QPO is only present for a fraction of the time series and the noise level
is varying throughout the time series. This can occur for example if background
noise from before or after the transient is included in the time series or if
the low-frequency noise profile varies strongly over the time series. We

feature interactions in linear time, was primarily proposed for collaborative
recommendation and have been broadly used for regression, classification and
ranking tasks. Subspace Encoding Factorization Machine (SEFM) has been proposed
recently to overcome the expressiveness limitation of Factorization Machines
(FM) by applying explicit nonlinear feature mapping for both individual
features and feature interactions through one-hot encoding to each input
feature. Despite the effectiveness of SEFM, it increases the memory cost of FM
by $b$ times, where $b$ is the number of bins when applying one-hot encoding on
each input feature. To reduce the memory cost of SEFM, we propose a new method
called Binarized FM which constraints the model parameters to be binary values
(i.e., 1 or $-1$). Then each parameter value can be efficiently stored in one
bit. Our proposed method can significantly reduce the memory cost of SEFM
model. In addition, we propose a new algorithm to effectively and efficiently
learn proposed FM with binary constraints using Straight Through Estimator
(STE) with Adaptive Gradient Descent (Adagrad). Finally, we evaluate the
performance of our proposed method on eight different classification datasets.
Our experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed method achieves

infrared cameras, in a cross-modal setting. Two main challenges in VI-reID are
intra-class variations across person images, and cross-modal discrepancies
between visible and infrared images. Assuming that the person images are
roughly aligned, previous approaches attempt to learn coarse image- or rigid
part-level person representations that are discriminative and generalizable
across different modalities. However, the person images, typically cropped by
off-the-shelf object detectors, are not necessarily well-aligned, which
distract discriminative person representation learning. In this paper, we
introduce a novel feature learning framework that addresses these problems in a
unified way. To this end, we propose to exploit dense correspondences between
cross-modal person images. This allows to address the cross-modal discrepancies
in a pixel-level, suppressing modality-related features from person
representations more effectively. This also encourages pixel-wise associations
between cross-modal local features, further facilitating discriminative feature
learning for VI-reID. Extensive experiments and analyses on standard VI-reID
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which significantly
outperforms the state of the art.

limited (i.e they have a finite synchronization region) and they have no memory
of past interactions (i.e. they return to their intrinsic frequency whenever
the entraining signal disappears). We previously proposed a general mechanism
to transform an oscillator into an adaptive frequency oscillator which adapts
its parameters to learn the frequency of any input signal. The synchronization
region then becomes infinite and the oscillator retains the entrainment
frequency when the driving signal disappears. While this mechanism has been
successfully used in various applications, such as robot control or observer
design for active prosthesis, a formal understanding of its properties is still
missing. In this paper, we study the adaptation mechanism in the case of
strongly coupled phase oscillators and show that non-trivial slow-fast dynamics
is at the origin of the adaptation. We show the existence of a layered
structure of stable and unstable invariant slow manifolds and demonstrate how
the input signal forces the dynamics to jump between these manifolds at regular
intervals, leading to exponential convergence of the frequency adaptation. We
extend the idea to a network of oscillators with amplitude adaptation and show
that the slow invariant manifolds structure persists. Numerical simulations
validate our analysis and extend the discussion to more complex cases.

analysis is that it is backed up by a stability (isometry) property:
persistence diagrams of $1$-parameter persistence modules are stable in the
sense that the bottleneck distance between two diagrams equals the interleaving
distance between their generating modules. However, in multi-parameter setting
this property breaks down in general. A simple special case of persistence
modules called rectangle decomposable modules is known to admit a weaker
stability property. Using this fact, we derive a stability-like property for
$2$-parameter persistence modules. For this, first we consider interval
decomposable modules and their optimal approximations with rectangle
decomposable modules with respect to the bottleneck distance. We provide a
polynomial time algorithm to exactly compute this optimal approximation which,
together with the polynomial-time computable bottleneck distance among interval
decomposable modules, provides a lower bound on the interleaving distance.
Next, we leverage this result to derive a polynomial-time computable distance
for general multi-parameter persistence modules which enjoys similar
stability-like property. This distance can be viewed as a generalization of the

the Hot Universe Baryon Surveyor (\textit{HUBS}) is proposed. \textit{HUBS} is
designed to probe hot CGM by detecting its emission or absorption lines with a
non-dispersive X-ray spectrometer of high resolution and high throughput. The
spectrometer consists of a $60\times60$ array of microcalorimeters, with each
detector providing an energy resolution of $2~\mathrm{eV}$, and is placed in
the focal plane of an X-ray telescope of $1^{\circ}$ field-of-view. With such a

have begun to leverage deep learning methods to model large biological

evolutionary information is encoded in protein sequences. Inspired by the

effect of the non-straight particle trajectory, because it seems to be
impossible to obtain the curvature information from a pair of particle images.
As a result, the computed vector underestimates the real velocity due to the
straight-line approximation, that further causes a systematic error for the PIV
instrument. In this work, the particle curved trajectory between two recordings
is firstly explained with the streamline segment of a steady flow
(diffeomorphic transformation) instead of a single vector, and this idea is
termed as diffeomorphic PIV. Specifically, a deformation field is introduced to
describe the particle displacement, i.e., we try to find the optimal velocity
field, of which the corresponding deformation vector field agrees with the
particle displacement. Because the variation of the deformation function can be
approximated with the variation of the velocity function, the diffeomorphic PIV
can be implemented as iterative PIV. That says, the diffeomorphic PIV warps the
images with deformation vector field instead of the velocity, and keeps the
rest as same as iterative PIVs. Two diffeomorphic deformation schemes --
forward diffeomorphic deformation interrogation (FDDI) and central
diffeomorphic deformation interrogation (CDDI) -- are proposed. Tested on
synthetic images, the FDDI achieves significant accuracy improvement across
different one-pass displacement estimators (cross-correlation, optical flow,
deep learning flow). Besides, the results on three real PIV image pairs
demonstrate the non-negligible curvature effect for CDI-based PIV, and our FDDI
provides larger velocity estimation (more accurate) in the fast curvy
streamline areas. The accuracy improvement of the combination of FDDI and
accurate dense estimator means that our diffeomorphic PIV paves a new way for
complex flow measurement.

Dual-coupled cavities have been proposed to generate Kerr optical frequency

we obtain a quadric algebraic equation describing the modulation instability

platicons can be generated via pump scanning scheme for the case that both the
two cavities possess normal dispersion, and a single dissipative Kerr soliton
can be generated in the cavity with anomalous dispersion while the dispersion
of the other cavity is normal. Our analysis of modulation instability provides
a powerful tool for Kerr optical frequency-comb generation via pump modulation

problem involving $N$ pursuers and a single evader in an unbounded
two-dimensional game domain. Throughout the game, the pursuers are required to
maintain encirclement of the evader, i.e., the evader should always stay inside
the convex hull generated by all the pursuers, in addition to achieving the
classical capture condition. To tackle this challenging cooperative pursuit
problem, a robust model predictive control (RMPC) based formulation framework
is first introduced, which simultaneously accounts for the encirclement and
capture requirements under the assumption that the evader's action is
unavailable to all pursuers. Despite the reformulation, the resulting RMPC
problem involves a bilinear constraint due to the encirclement requirement. To
further handle such a bilinear constraint, a novel encirclement guaranteed
partitioning scheme is devised that simplifies the original bilinear RMPC
problem to a number of linear tube MPC (TMPC) problems solvable in a
decentralized manner. Simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed solution framework. Furthermore, comparisons with existing
approaches show that the explicit consideration of the encirclement condition
significantly improves the chance of successful capture of the evader in
various scenarios.

source in a broad energy range using archival data from Swift/XRT, MAXI/GSC and

observed during the outburst. The combined 1-50 keV spectra are analyzed using
the transonic flow solution based Two Component Advective Flow (TCAF) model.
Based on the variations of soft and hard X-ray fluxes, their hardness ratios
and the variations of the spectral model fitted parameters, we find that the
source has evolved through six spectral states. We interpret this spectral
state evolution to be a result of two connected outbursts where the leftover
matter from a primary outburst is released from the pile-up radius due to a
sudden rise of viscosity causing a reflare/secondary outburst. We show a
possible configuration of the evolution of accretion flow during the outburst.
From the spectral analysis with TCAF model, we estimate the mass of the black

underdamped regime, we observe long-lived coherent dynamics that lasts for
$\tau_c\simeq 1/r$, even though the initial state of the $\Lambda$-system
contains no coherences in the energy basis. In the overdamped regime for $p =

machine learning has been drawing much attention in both academia and industry.
However, most existing methods have their limitations in practical
applications. On the one hand, although most cryptographic methods are provable
secure, they bring heavy computation and communication. On the other hand, the
security of many relatively efficient private methods (e.g., federated learning
and split learning) is being questioned, since they are non-provable secure.
Inspired by previous work on privacy-preserving machine learning, we build a
privacy-preserving machine learning framework by combining random permutation
and arithmetic secret sharing via our compute-after-permutation technique.
Since our method reduces the cost for element-wise function computation, it is
more efficient than existing cryptographic methods. Moreover, by adopting
distance correlation as a metric for privacy leakage, we demonstrate that our
method is more secure than previous non-provable secure methods. Overall, our
proposal achieves a good balance between security and efficiency. Experimental
results show that our method not only is up to 6x faster and reduces up to 85%

leaks less privacy during the training process compared with non-provable

$\boldsymbol{a}$-multiset permutation is a string of length $n$ that contains
exactly $a_i$ symbols $i$ for each $i=1,\ldots,k$. In this work we consider the
problem of exhaustively generating all $\boldsymbol{a}$-multiset permutations
by star transpositions, i.e., in each step, the first entry of the string is
transposed with any other entry distinct from the first one. This is a
far-ranging generalization of several known results. For example, it is known
that permutations ($a_1=\cdots=a_k=1$) can be generated by star transpositions,
while combinations ($k=2$) can be generated by these operations if and only if
they are balanced ($a_1=a_2$), with the positive case following from the middle
levels theorem. To understand the problem in general, we introduce a parameter
$\Delta(\boldsymbol{a}):=n-2\max\{a_1,\ldots,a_k\}$ that allows us to
distinguish three different regimes for this problem. We show that if
$\Delta(\boldsymbol{a})<0$, then a star transposition Gray code for
$\boldsymbol{a}$-multiset permutations does not exist. We also construct such
Gray codes for the case $\Delta(\boldsymbol{a})>0$, assuming that they exist
for the case $\Delta(\boldsymbol{a})=0$. For the case
$\Delta(\boldsymbol{a})=0$ we present some partial positive results. Our proofs
establish Hamilton-connectedness or Hamilton-laceability of the underlying flip

dense scribbles are propagated to the entire image. To alleviate incorrect

more on external open source dependencies, made available through package
managers. Key ecosystem packages that go unmaintained create a health risk for
the projects that depend on them and for the ecosystem as a whole. Therefore,
community initiatives can emerge to alleviate the problem by adopting packages
in need of maintenance. b) Objective: The goal of our study is to explore such
community initiatives, that we will designate from now on as Community Package
Maintenance Organizations (CPMOs) and to build a theory of how and why they
emerge, how they function and their impact on the surrounding ecosystems. c)
Method: To achieve this, we plan on using a qualitative methodology called
Grounded Theory. We have begun applying this methodology, by relying on
""extant"" documents originating from several CPMOs. We present our preliminary
results and the research questions that have emerged. We plan to answer these
questions by collecting appropriate data (theoretical sampling), in particular
by contacting CPMO participants and questioning them by e-mails, questionnaires
or semi-structured interviews. d) Impact: Our theory should inform developers
willing to launch a CPMO in their own ecosystem and help current CPMO
participants to better understand the state of the practice and what they could
do better.

Therefore, any reliable model of such physical processes must consider the
coupling of fluids and solids. However, complexity increases for non-Newtonian
fluid models, as used, e.g., for blood or polymer flows. In these fluids,
subtle differences in the local shear rate can have a drastic impact on the
flow and hence on the coupled problem. There, existing (semi-)implicit solution
strategies based on split-step or projection schemes for Newtonian fluids are
not applicable, while extensions to non-Newtonian fluids can lead to
substantial numerical overhead depending on the chosen fluid solver. To address
these shortcomings, we present here a higher-order accurate, added-mass-stable
fluid-structure interaction scheme centered around a split-step fluid solver.
We compare several implicit and semi-implicit variants of the algorithm and
verify convergence in space and time. Numerical examples show good performance

scene understanding. It is yet challenging due to the compound factors of data
irregularity and uncertainty in the numbers of instances. State-of-the-art
methods largely rely on a general pipeline that first learns point-wise
features discriminative at semantic and instance levels, followed by a separate
step of point grouping for proposing object instances. While promising, they
have the shortcomings that (1) the second step is not supervised by the main
objective of instance segmentation, and (2) their point-wise feature learning
and grouping are less effective to deal with data irregularities, possibly
resulting in fragmented segmentations. To address these issues, we propose in
this work an end-to-end solution of Semantic Superpoint Tree Network (SSTNet)
for proposing object instances from scene points. Key in SSTNet is an
intermediate, semantic superpoint tree (SST), which is constructed based on the
learned semantic features of superpoints, and which will be traversed and split
at intermediate tree nodes for proposals of object instances. We also design in
SSTNet a refinement module, termed CliqueNet, to prune superpoints that may be
wrongly grouped into instance proposals. Experiments on the benchmarks of
ScanNet and S3DIS show the efficacy of our proposed method. At the time of
submission, SSTNet ranks top on the ScanNet (V2) leaderboard, with 2% higher of
mAP than the second best method. The source code in PyTorch is available at

imitation paradigm introduces imitation masks to focus on informative
foreground areas while excluding the background noises. However, we find that
those methods fail to fully utilize the semantic information in all feature

FPN-based detectors. To this end, we propose a novel semantic-guided feature
imitation technique, which automatically performs soft matching between feature
pairs across all pyramid levels to provide the optimal guidance to the student.
To push the envelop even further, we introduce contrastive distillation to
effectively capture the information encoded in the relationship between
different feature regions. Finally, we propose a generalized detection KD
pipeline, which is capable of distilling both homogeneous and heterogeneous
detector pairs. Our method consistently outperforms the existing detection KD
techniques, and works when (1) components in the framework are used separately

inverted parabola. Our theory is applicable under certain technical assumptions
on the nature of the Gibbs property and the underlying random walk measure. As
a particular application of our general framework we show that a certain
sequence of Gibbsian line ensembles, which naturally arises in the log-gamma
polymer, is tight in the ubiquitous KPZ class $1/3: 2/3$ scaling, and also that
all subsequential limits satisfy the Brownian Gibbs property, introduced by
Corwin and Hammond in (Invent. Math. 195, 441-508, 2014).
  One of the core results proved in the paper, which underlies many of our
arguments, is the construction of a continuous grand monotone coupling of
Gibbsian line ensembles with respect to their boundary data (entrance and exit
values, and bounding curves). Continuous means that the Gibbsian line ensemble
measure varies continuously as one varies the boundary data, grand means that
all uncountably many measures (one for each boundary data) are coupled to the
same probability space, and monotone means that raising the values of the
boundary data likewise raises the associated measure. Our continuous grand
monotone coupling generalizes an analogous construction, which was recently
implemented by Barraquand, Corwin and Dimitrov in (arXiv:2101.03045), from line
ensembles with a single curve to ones with an arbitrary finite number of

conceptual developments about possible criteria to guarantee the uniqueness of
the quantization in a variety of situations that are found in cosmological

any existing symmetry of the spatial sections. These symmetries may or may not
be sufficient for the purpose of uniqueness and may have to be complemented
with other remaining symmetries that affect the time direction, or with
dynamical transformations that in fact are not symmetries. We discuss the
extent to which a unitary implementation of the resulting group suffices to fix
the quantization, a demand that can be seen as a weaker version of the
requirement of invariance. In particular, a strict invariance under certain
transformations may eliminate some physically interesting possibilities in the
passage to the quantum theory. This is the first review in which this unified
perspective is adopted to discuss otherwise rather different uniqueness
criteria proposed either in homogeneous loop quantum cosmology or in the Fock

controls, respectively. We compare performance against six clinical readers,
including two radiologists, two hepato-pancreatico-biliary (HPB) surgeons, and
two hepatologists. The area under curve (AUC) of the localization receiver
operating characteristic (LROC) for NC-only, NC plus VP, and full DCE CT
yielded 0.71, 0.81, 0.89 respectively. At a high sensitivity operating point of
80% on DCE CT, HPVD achieved 97% specificity, which is comparable to measured
physician performance. We also demonstrate performance improvements over more
typical and less flexible non hetero-phase detectors. Thus, we demonstrate that
a single deep learning algorithm can be effectively applied to diverse HCC
detection clinical scenarios.

applications of the C*-envelope theory for cosystems of nonselfadjoint operator
algebras recently produced. We derive several applications of these methods
that generalize results on single C*-correspondences.
  First we show that if the controlling group is exact then the co-universal
C*-algebra of the product system coincides with the quotient of the Fock
C*-algebra by the ideal of strong covariance relations. We show that if the
controlling group is amenable then the product system is amenable. In
particular if the controlling group is abelian then the co-universal C*-algebra
is the C*-envelope of the tensor algebra.
  Secondly we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the Fock C*-algebra
to be nuclear and exact. When the controlling group is amenable we completely
characterize nuclearity and exactness of any equivariant injective
Nica-covariant representation of the product system.
  Thirdly we consider controlled maps that enjoy a saturation property. In this
case we induce a compactly aligned product system over the controlling pair
that shares the same Fock representation, and preserves injectivity. By using
co-universality, we show that they share the same reduced covariance algebras.
If in addition the controlling pair is a total order then the fixed point
algebra of the controlling group induces a super-product system that has the
same reduced covariance algebra and is moreover reversible.

coherent communications, microwave synthesis or the calibration of astronomical

rates <50GHz. However, attaining soliton microcombs with low repetition rates
using photonic integration technologies represents a formidable challenge.
Expanding the cavity volume results in a drop of intracavity intensity that can
only be offset by an encompassing rise in quality factor. In addition, reducing
the footprint of the microresonator on a planar integrated circuit requires
race-track designs that typically result into extra modal coupling losses and
disruptions into the dispersion, preventing the generation of the dissipative
single soliton state. Here, we report the generation of sub-50GHz soliton
microcombs in dispersion-engineered silicon nitride microresonators. In
contrast to other approaches, our devices feature an optimized racetrack design
that minimizes the coupling to higher-order modes and reduces the footprint
size by an order of magnitude to ~1mm2. The statistical intrinsic Q reaches 19
million, and soliton microcombs at 20.5GHz and 14.0GHz repetition rates are
successfully generated. Importantly, the fabrication process is entirely
subtractive, meaning that the devices can be directly patterned on the Si3N4

to simulate the elastic/acoustic waveguide problem in anisotropic media with

length, making it difficult to extract the long-term interest of users. On the
other hand, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP)-based models, renowned for their

From experiments, we observed that introducing explicit high-order interactions

investigated this question as to the nature of doping induced superconductivity

pairing. We employed the {\it ab initio} density functional theory and density
functional perturbation theory to compute the electron-phonon coupling
Eliashberg function from which to calculate the superconducting (SC) critical
temperature $T_c$. The calculated $T_c $ as a function of the doping
concentration $x$ exhibits a dome shape with the maximum $T_c$ of $2-6$ K at $x

maximal $T_c$ was found to be pinned to the quantum critical point at which the
CDW is completely suppressed and the corresponding phonon mode becomes soft.
Underlying physics is that the reduced phonon frequency enhances the
electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda$ which overcompensates the frequency
decrease to produce a net increase of $T_c$. The doping induced
superconductivity in Cu$_x$TiSe$_2$ seems to be consistent with the

In RBN, the processes communicate by selective broadcast: a process can
broadcast a message which is received by all of its neighbors, and the set of
neighbors of a process can change arbitrarily over time. In ASMS, the processes
communicate by shared memory: a process can either write to or read from a
shared register. Our main result is that RBN and ASMS can simulate each other,

LiDAR hinder its performance, \ie, how to effectively fuse these two modalities
and how to precisely align them (suffering from the weak spatiotemporal
synchronization problem). In this paper, we propose a coarse-to-fine LiDAR and
camera fusion-based network (termed as LIF-Seg) for LiDAR segmentation. For the
first issue, unlike these previous works fusing the point cloud and image
information in a one-to-one manner, the proposed method fully utilizes the
contextual information of images and introduces a simple but effective
early-fusion strategy. Second, due to the weak spatiotemporal synchronization
problem, an offset rectification approach is designed to align these
two-modality features. The cooperation of these two components leads to the
success of the effective camera-LiDAR fusion. Experimental results on the
nuScenes dataset show the superiority of the proposed LIF-Seg over existing
methods with a large margin. Ablation studies and analyses demonstrate that our
proposed LIF-Seg can effectively tackle the weak spatiotemporal synchronization
problem.

photon flux of approx. 7 x $10^{9}$ photons/s to a dose of approximately
760$\pm$65 kGy at the location of the Si/SiO$_2$ interfaces in the sensor. A
dose dependent increase in both offset and noise of the ePix100a detector have
been observed originating from an increase of the sensor leakage current.
Moreover, we observed an effect directly after irradiation resulting in the
saturation of individual pixels by their dark current. Changes in gain are
evaluated one and half hours post irradiation and suggest damage to occur also
on the ASIC level. Based on the obtained results, thresholds for beam
parameters are deduced and the detector lifetime is estimated with respect to
the requirements to the data quality in order to satisfy the scientific
standards defined by the experiments. We conclude the detector can withstand a
beam with an energy up to 1 $\mu$J at a photon energy of 9 keV impacting on an
area of 1 mm$^2$. The detector can be used without significant degradation of
its performance for several years if the incident photon beam intensities do

we present an unsupervised approach to conduct the pose transfer between any

propose a co-occurrence discriminator to capture the structural/pose invariance
from distinct Laplacians of the mesh. Meanwhile, intrinsically, a local
intrinsic-preserved loss is introduced to preserve the geodesic priors while
avoiding heavy computations. At last, we show the possibility of using IEP-GAN
to manipulate 3D human meshes in various ways, including pose transfer,
identity swapping and pose interpolation with latent code vector arithmetic.
The extensive experiments on various 3D datasets of humans, animals and hands

heat of crystalline bulk materials are well described by Debye theory, which
successfully predicts the quadratic $\omega^{2}$ low-frequency scaling of the
vibrational density of states (VDOS) in bulk ordered solids from few
fundamental assumptions. However, the analogous framework for nanoconfined
materials with fewer degrees of freedom has been far less well explored. Using
inelastic neutron scattering, we characterize the VDOS of amorphous ice
confined to a thickness of $\approx 1$ nm inside graphene oxide membranes and
we observe a crossover from the Debye $\omega^2$ scaling to an anomalous
$\omega^3$ behaviour upon reducing the confinement size $L$. Additionally,
using molecular dynamics simulations, we confirm the experimental findings and
also prove that such a scaling of the VDOS appears in both crystalline and
amorphous solids under slab-confinement. We theoretically demonstrate that this
low-frequency $\omega^3$ law results from the geometric constraints on the
momentum phase space induced by confinement along one spatial direction.
Finally, we predict that the Debye scaling reappears at a characteristic
frequency $\omega_\times= v L/2\pi$, with $v$ the speed of sound of the
material, and we confirm this quantitative estimate with simulations. This new
physical phenomenon, revealed by combining theoretical, experimental and
simulations results, is relevant to a myriad of systems both in synthetic and
biological contexts and it could impact various technological applications for
systems under confinement such as nano-devices or thin films.

dense $npe$ matter induced by the Urca processes in the neutrino trapped regime
to $npe\mu$ matter by adding the muonic Urca processes as well as the purely
leptonic electroweak processes involving electron-muon transition. The nuclear
matter is modeled in a relativistic density functional approach with two
different parametrizations which predict neutrino dominated matter (DDME2
model) and antineutrino dominated matter (NL3 model) at temperatures for which
neutrinos/antineutrinos are trapped. In the case of neutrino-dominated matter,
the main equilibration mechanism is lepton capture, whereas in the case of
antineutrino-dominated matter this is due to neutron decay. We find that the
equilibration rates of Urca processes are higher than that of the pure leptonic
processes, which implies that the Urca-process-driven bulk viscosity can be
computed with the leptonic reactions assumed to be frozen. We find that the
bulk viscosity decreases with temperature as $\zeta\sim T^{-2}$ at moderate
temperatures. At high temperatures this scaling breaks down by sharp drops of
the bulk viscosity close to the temperature where the proton fraction is
density-independent and the matter becomes scale-invariant. This occurs also
when the matter undergoes a transition from the antineutrino-dominated regime
to the neutrino-dominated regime where the bulk viscosity attains a local
maximum. We also estimate the bulk viscous dissipation timescales and find that
these are in the range $\gtrsim$ 1 s for temperatures above the neutrino

we present a new method to derive muon rescaling factors by analyzing
reconstructions of simulated showers. The z-variable used (difference of
initially simulated and reconstructed total signal in detectors) is connected
to the muon signal and is roughly independent of the zenith angle but depends
on the mass of primary cosmic ray. The performance of the method is tested
using Monte Carlo shower simulations for the hybrid detector of the Pierre
Auger Observatory. Having an individual z-value from each simulated hybrid
event, the corresponding signal at 1000 m from the shower axis, and using a
parametrization of the muon fraction in simulated showers, we can calculate the
multiplicative rescaling parameters of the muon signals in the ground detector
even for an individual event. We can also study its dependence as a function of
zenith angle and the mass of primary cosmic ray. This gives a possibility not
only to test/calibrate the hadronic interaction models, but also to derive the
$\beta$-exponent, describing an increase of the number of muons as a function
of primary energy and mass of the cosmic ray. Detailed simulations show
dependence of the $\beta$-exponent on hadronic interaction properties, thus the
determination of this parameter is important for understanding the muon deficit

be noted that, if one of the steady states is an extinction state, the
catastrophic change may lead to extinction. A suitable manual measure may
control the prevention of catastrophic changes of different species from one
equilibrium to another. We consider two stochastic models with linear and
nonlinear harvesting terms. We inspect either density regulation or Allee type
density regulated models [Saha et al., Ecological Modelling, 2013], which have
substantial applications in the herring fish population's viability study. Both
the deterministic models we consider here contain bi-stability under certain
restrictions, and in that case, one of the stable states is the extinction
state. We assume that the dynamical system under consideration is closed, i.e.,
immigration and emigration are absent. The demographic noise is introduced in
the system by substituting an ordinary differential equation with a stochastic
differential equation model, where the birth and death rates of the
deterministic process are used to obtain the instantaneous mean and variance in
the stochastic differential equation. Our study reveals that, the catastrophic
changes can be avoided manually by a suitable choice of handling time that will
eventually help to prevent the sudden extinction of the harvested population.

using visible cross section data. It is assumed that the initial state
radiation is taken into account in a visible cross section, while in a Born
cross section this effect is ommited. Since the equation that connects Born and
visible cross sections is an integral equation of the first kind, the problem
of finding its numerical solution is ill-posed. Various regularization-based
approaches are often used to solve ill-posed problems, since direct methods
usually do not lead to an acceptable result. However, in this article it is
shown that a direct method can be successfully used to numerically solve the
considered equation under the condition of a small beam energy spread and
uncertainty. This naive method is based on finding a numerical solution to the
integral equation by reducing it to a system of linear equations. The naive
method works well because the kernel of the integral operator is a rapidly
decreasing function of the variable $x$. This property of the kernel leads to
the fact that the condition number of the matrix of the system of linear
equations is of the order of unity, which makes it possible to neglect the
ill-posedness of the problem when the above condition is satisfied. The
advantages of the naive method are its model independence and the possibility
of obtaining the covariance matrix of a Born cross section in a simple way.

to the formation of the dispersion with a stationary inflection point and
consequently to the high coupling efficiency of this mode with a dipole source.
We show that the distribution of the field polarization inside the waveguide is
relatively homogeneous maintaining the circular polarization in a large area.
Consequently, this leads to a high degree of tolerance of the coupling
asymmetry and strength to the position of the quantum emitter. We believe, that
our results will extend the variety of designs of the efficient chiral

the aggregation capability of Capsule Network and the graph-based structure

stable pseudo-flow is a nonzero-stable pseudo-flow, there exists no feasible
solution for multicommodity flow problem; if the stable pseudo-flow is a
zero-stable pseudo-flow, there exists a feasible solution and the zero-stable
pseudo-flow is the feasible solution. Additionally, the algorithms work in a
localized manner and can be efficiently implemented in parallel, which would
further improve the performance.

However, often we require inference on the second-order behaviour of the

article, we propose a method, using differencing, to jointly estimate the
time-varying trend and second-order structure of a nonstationary time series,
within the locally stationary wavelet modelling framework. We develop a
wavelet-based estimator of the second-order structure of the original time

into the estimation of the trend of the time series. We perform a simulation
study to investigate the performance of the methodology, and demonstrate the
utility of the method by analysing data examples from environmental and

almost-clique separators in the context of computing the treewidth $\tw(G)$ of
a given graph $G$. A separator $S \subseteq V(G)$ of $G$ is an
\emph{almost-clique separator} if $S \setminus \{v\}$ is a clique of $G$ for
some $v \in S$. $S$ is a \emph{minimal separator} if $S$ has at least two full
components, where a full component of $S$ is a connected component $C$ of $G
\setminus S$ such that $N_G(C) = S$. They observed that if $S$ is an
almost-clique minimal separator of $G$ then $\tw(G \cup K(S)) = \tw(G)$, where
$K(S)$ is the complete graph on vertex set $S$: in words, filling an
almost-clique minimal separator into a clique does not increase the treewidth.
Based on this observation, they proposed a preprocessing method for treewidth
computation, a fundamental step of which is to find a preferably maximal set of
pairwise non-crossing almost-clique minimal separators of a graph.
  In this paper, we present a heuristic for this step, which is based on the
following empirical observation. For graph $G$ and a minimal triangulation $H$
of $G$, let $\QQ(H, G)$ denote the set of all almost-clique minimal separators
of $G$ that are minimal separators of $H$. Note that since the minimal
separators of $H$ are pairwise non-crossing, so are those in $\QQ(H, G)$. We
observe from experiments that $\QQ(H, G)$ is remarkably close to maximal,
especially when the minimal triangulation $H$ is computed by an algorithm
aiming for small treewidth.
  This observation leads to an efficient implementation of the preprocessing
method proposed by Bodlaender and Koster. Experiments on instances from PACE
2017 and other sources show that this implementation is extremely fast and
effective for graphs of practical interest.

they will readily learn to associate odors with both electric shock or sugar
rewards. The mechanisms of the insect brain apparently responsible for odor
learning form a relatively shallow neuronal architecture. Olfactory inputs are
received by the antennal lobe (AL) of the brain, which produces an encoding of
each odor mixture across ~50 sub-units known as glomeruli. Each of these
glomeruli then project its component of this feature vector to several of ~2000
so-called Kenyon Cells (KCs) in a region of the brain known as the mushroom
body (MB). Fly responses to odors are generated by small downstream neuropils
that decode the higher-order representation from the MB. Research has shown
that there is no recognizable pattern in the glomeruli--KC connections (and
thus the particular higher-order representations); they are akin to
fingerprints~-- even isogenic flies have different projections. Leveraging
insights from this architecture, we propose KCNet, a single-hidden-layer neural
network that contains sparse, randomized, binary weights between the input
layer and the hidden layer and analytically learned weights between the hidden
layer and the output layer. Furthermore, we also propose a dynamic optimization
algorithm that enables the KCNet to increase performance beyond its structural
limits by searching a more efficient set of inputs. For odorant-perception
tasks that predict perceptual properties of an odorant, we show that KCNet
outperforms existing data-driven approaches, such as XGBoost. For
image-classification tasks, KCNet achieves reasonable performance on benchmark
datasets (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and EMNIST) without any data-augmentation
methods or convolutional layers and shows particularly fast running time. Thus,
neural networks inspired by the insect brain can be both economical and perform
well.

clouds with gas column densities of $\sim10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, the theory
predicts depletion of sub-GeV CR electrons, occurring due to self-modulation of
CR protons and leading to harder synchrotron spectra in the sub-GHz range. The
predicted imprints of electron depletion in the synchrotron spectra agree well
with the spectral hardening seen in available radio observations of the CMZ. A
similar, but even stronger effect on the synchrotron emission is predicted for
individual (denser) CMZ clouds, such as the Sgr B2. However, the emission at
frequencies above $\sim$ GHz, where observational data are available, is
completely dominated by the thermal component, and therefore new observations
at lower frequencies are needed to verify the predictions.

cumbersome. Here we compare the classical (non-relativistic) with the

sections and offer a prescription for the use of the much simpler classical
expressions with impressively accurate results. We have expanded the
quantum-mechanical differential cross sections and kept terms up to first order
in $\epsilon \equiv E/m_ec^2$ and $B \equiv {\cal B}/{\cal B}_{cr}$, where $E$
is the photon energy and ${\cal B}_{cr}$ is the critical magnetic field, and
recovered the classical differential cross sections plus terms that are due to
spin flip, which is a pure quantum-mechanical phenomenon. Adding by hand the
spin-flip terms to the polarization-dependent classical differential cross
sections, we find that they are in excellent agreement with the quantum
mechanical ones for all energies near resonance and all angles. We have plotted
both of them and the agreement is impressive. We give a prescription for the
use of the classical differential cross sections that guarantees very accurate
results.

exhibit a cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF) and, sometimes, higher
harmonics of it. Two places are suspect for the formation of a CRSF: the
surface of the neutron star and the radiative shock in the accretion column.
Here we explore the first possibility: reflection at the neutron-star surface
of the continuum produced at the radiative shock. It has been proposed that for
high-luminosity sources, as the luminosity increases, the height of the
radiative shock increases, thus a larger polar area is illuminated, and as a
consequence the energy of the CRSF decreases because the dipole magnetic field
decreases by a factor of two from the pole to the equator. We used a Monte
Carlo code to compute the reflected spectrum from the atmosphere of a magnetic
neutron star, when the incident spectrum is a power-law one. We restricted
ourselves to cyclotron energies $\ll m_ec^2$ and used polarization-dependent
scattering cross sections, allowing for polarization mode change. As expected,
a prominent CRSF is produced in the reflected spectra if the incident photons
are in a pencil beam, which hits the neutron-star surface at a point with a
well-defined magnetic field strength. However, the incident beam from the
radiative shock has a finite width and thus various magnetic field strengths
are sampled. As a result of overlap, the reflected spectra have a CRSF, which
is close to that produced at the magnetic pole, independent of the height of
the radiative shock. Reflection at the surface of a magnetic neutron star
cannot explain the observed decrease in the CRSF energy with luminosity in the
high-luminosity X-ray pulsar V 0332+53.

collaborative behaviors untapped. In fact, the collaborative filtering signals
between users intuitively offer a complementary information for the semantic
matching. To close the gap between collaborative filtering and product search,
we propose a Hierarchical Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (HHGNN) approach
in this paper. Specifically, we organize HHGNN with a hierarchical graph
structure according to the three edge types. The sequence edge accounts for the
syntax formulation from word nodes to sentence nodes; the composition edge
aggregates the semantic features to the user and product nodes; and the
interaction edge on the top performs graph convolutional operation between user
and product nodes. At last, we integrate the higher-order neighboring
collaborative features and the semantic features for better representation
learning. We conduct extensive experiments on six Amazon review datasets. The
results show that our proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art
baselines with a large margin. In addition, we empirically prove that
collaborative filtering and semantic matching are complementary to each other
in product search performance enhancement.

Animal cognition is modeled by integrating three separate networks: (i) a

precoding is a promising technique to meet the high data rate requirements for
future 6G communications. To realize efficient hybrid precoding, it is
essential to obtain accurate channel state information. Existing channel
estimation algorithms with low pilot overhead heavily rely on the channel
sparsity in the angle domain, which is achieved by the classical far-field
planar wavefront assumption. However, due to the non-negligible near-field
spherical wavefront property in XL-MIMO systems, this channel sparsity in the
angle domain is not available anymore, and thus existing far-field channel
estimation schemes will suffer from severe performance loss. To address this
problem, in this paper we study the near-field channel estimation by exploiting
the polar-domain sparse representation of the near-field XL-MIMO channel.
Specifically, unlike the classical angle-domain representation that only
considers the angle information of the channel, we propose a new polar-domain
representation, which simultaneously accounts for both the angle and distance
information. In this way, the near-field channel also exhibits sparsity in the
polar domain. By exploiting the channel sparsity in the polar domain, we
propose the on-grid and off-grid near-field channel estimation schemes for
XL-MIMO. Firstly, an on-grid polar-domain simultaneous orthogonal matching
pursuit (P-SOMP) algorithm is proposed to efficiently estimate the near-field
channel. Furthermore, to solve the resolution limitation of the on-grid P-SOMP
algorithm, an off-grid polar-domain simultaneous iterative gridless weighted
(P-SIGW) algorithm is proposed to improve the estimation accuracy, where the
parameters of the near-field channel are directly estimated. Finally, numerical
results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

couplings between the layers. We find that the flat bands and the gaps

at the vapour-liquid interface is controlled by the vapour diffusion process,
which nevertheless hardly senses the macroscopic shape of this interface. Here,
deformed sessile drops due to gravity and surface tension with various
interfacial profiles are realised by tilting flat substrates. The symmetry
broken of the sessile drop geometry leads to a different evaporation behavior
compared to a drop with a symmetric cap on a horizontal substrate. Rather than
the vapour-diffusion mechanism, heat-diffusion regime is defined here to
calculate the local evaporation flux along the deformed drop interface. A local
heat resistance, characterised by the liquid layer thickness perpendicular to
the substrate, is proposed to relate the local evaporation flux. We find that
the drops with and without deformation evaporate with a minimum flux at the
drop apex, while up to a maximum one with a significantly larger but finite
value at the contact line. Counterintuitively, the deviation from the symmetric
shape due to the deformation on a slope, surprisingly enhances the total
evaporation rate; and the smaller contact angle, the more significant
enhancement. Larger tilt quickens the overall evaporation process and induces a
more heterogeneous distribution of evaporative flux under gravity.
Interestingly, with this concept of heat flux, an intrinsic heat resistance is
conceivable around the contact line, which naturally removes the singularity of
the evaporation flux showing in the vapour-diffusion model. The detailed
non-uniform evaporation flux suggests ways to control the self-assembly,
microstructures of deposit with engineering applications particularly in three
dimensional printing where drying on slopes is inevitable.

It
plays a crucial role in astrophysical nuclear reactions. However, it is not
straightforward for variational nuclear structure models to describe it.
Purpose: We propose a tractable method to describe the isospin mixing within a
framework of the generator coordinate method and demonstrate its usability.
Method: We generate the basis wave functions by applying the Fermi transition
operator to the wave functions of isobars. The superposition of these basis
wave functions and variationally obtained wave functions quantitatively
describes the isospin mixing. Results: Using 14N as an example, we demonstrate
that our method reasonably describes both T = 0 and 1 states and their mixing.
Energy spectrum and E1 transition strengths are compared with the experimental
data to confirm isospin mixing. Conclusion: The proposed method is effective
enough to describe isospin mixing and is useful, for example, when we discuss
{\alpha} capture reactions of N = Z nuclei.

obtained competitive accuracy and learning speed across several benchmarks,
with frugal memory- and energy footprint. A TM represents patterns as
conjunctive clauses in propositional logic (AND-rules), each clause voting for
or against a particular output. While efficient for single-output problems, one
needs a separate TM per output for multi-output problems. Employing multiple
TMs hinders pattern reuse because each TM then operates in a silo. In this
paper, we introduce clause sharing, merging multiple TMs into a single one.
Each clause is related to each output by using a weight. A positive weight
makes the clause vote for output $1$, while a negative weight makes the clause
vote for output $0$. The clauses thus coalesce to produce multiple outputs. The
resulting coalesced Tsetlin Machine (CoTM) simultaneously learns both the
weights and the composition of each clause by employing interacting Stochastic
Searching on the Line (SSL) and Tsetlin Automata (TA) teams. Our empirical
results on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and Kuzushiji-MNIST show that CoTM obtains
significantly higher accuracy than TM on $50$- to $1$K-clause configurations,
indicating an ability to repurpose clauses. E.g., accuracy goes from $71.99$%
to $89.66$% on Fashion-MNIST when employing $50$ clauses per class (22 Kb
memory). While TM and CoTM accuracy is similar when using more than $1$K
clauses per class, CoTM reaches peak accuracy $3\times$ faster on MNIST with
$8$K clauses. We further investigate robustness towards imbalanced training
data. Our evaluations on imbalanced versions of IMDb- and CIFAR10 data show
that CoTM is robust towards high degrees of class imbalance. Being able to
share clauses, we believe CoTM will enable new TM application domains that
involve multiple outputs, such as learning language models and auto-encoding.

atomic-scale reactions is not possible, modeling is the only way to reveal
atomistic mechanisms which can lead to selection of abundant fullerene isomers
(like C60-Ih). In the present paper we review the results obtained for
different atomistic mechanisms by various modeling techniques. Although it
seems that atomic-scale processes related to odd fullerenes (such as growth by
consecutive insertions of single carbon atoms and rearrangements of the sp$^2$
structure promoted by extra sp atoms) provide the main contribution to
selection of abundant isomers, at the moment there is no conclusive evidence in
favor of any particular atomistic mechanism. Thus, the following multiscale
modeling strategy to solve the mystery of the high yield of abundant fullerene
isomers is suggested. On the one hand, sets of reactions between fullerene
isomers can be described using theoretical graph techniques. On the other hand,
reaction schemes can be revealed by classical molecular dynamics simulations
with subsequent refinement of the activation barriers by ab initio
calculations. Based on the reaction sets with the reaction probabilities
derived in this way, the different atomistic mechanisms of abundant fullerene
isomer selection can be compared by kinetic models.

follows: 1) A cross-correlation of the input data (i.e. images) with a randomly
picked sample pixel (or pixels) of all images from that domain or the mean of
all randomly picked sample pixel (or pixels) of all images. 2) The convolution
of the resulting data with the mean of the autocorrelated input images from the

source domain, and the mean of auto-correlated images are evaluated from the
target domain. In the inference/application stage, the input images are from
the target domain, and the mean of auto-correlated images are evaluated from
the source domain. The proposed method only manipulates the data from the

Similar to the non-reactive case, the present LBM features Stefan--Maxwell
diffusion of chemical species and a fully on-lattice mean-field realization of
the momentum and energy of the flow. Besides introducing the reaction mechanism
into the kinetic equations for the species, the proposed LBM also features a
new realization of the compressible flow by using a concept of extended
equilibrium on a standard lattice in three dimensions. The full thermodynamic
consistency of the original non-reactive multicomponent LBM enables to extend
the temperature dynamics to the reactive mixtures by merely including the
enthalpy of formation in addition to the previously considered sensible energy.
Furthermore, we describe in detail the boundary conditions to be used for
reactive flows of practical interest. The model is validated against a direct
numerical simulation of various burning regimes of a hydrogen/air mixture in a
microchannel, in two and three dimensions. Excellent comparison in these
demanding benchmarks indicates that the proposed LBM can be a valuable and

significantly deviate from normal appearance. Recent surface anomaly detection
methods rely on generative models to accurately reconstruct the normal areas
and to fail on anomalies. These methods are trained only on anomaly-free
images, and often require hand-crafted post-processing steps to localize the
anomalies, which prohibits optimizing the feature extraction for maximal
detection capability. In addition to reconstructive approach, we cast surface
anomaly detection primarily as a discriminative problem and propose a
discriminatively trained reconstruction anomaly embedding model (DRAEM). The
proposed method learns a joint representation of an anomalous image and its
anomaly-free reconstruction, while simultaneously learning a decision boundary
between normal and anomalous examples. The method enables direct anomaly
localization without the need for additional complicated post-processing of the
network output and can be trained using simple and general anomaly simulations.
On the challenging MVTec anomaly detection dataset, DRAEM outperforms the
current state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by a large margin and even
delivers detection performance close to the fully-supervised methods on the
widely used DAGM surface-defect detection dataset, while substantially
outperforming them in localization accuracy.

reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where the beamforming at the base station (BS)
is adapted to the rapidly-changing instantaneous channel state information
(CSI), while the passive beamforming at the RIS is adapted to the
slowly-changing statistical CSI.
  Specifically, we first propose a linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE)
estimator to obtain the aggregated channel from the users to the BS in each
channel coherence interval. Based on the estimated channel, we apply the
low-complexity maximal ratio combining (MRC) beamforming at the BS, and then
derive the ergodic achievable rate in a closed form expression.
  To draw design insights, we perform a detailed theoretical analysis departing
from the derived ergodic achievable rate. If the BS-RIS channel is Rician
distributed, we prove that the transmit power can be scaled proportionally to
$1/M$, as the number of BS antennas, $M$, grows to infinity while maintaining a
non-zero rate.
  If the BS-RIS channel is Rayleigh distributed, the transmit power can be
scaled either proportionally to $1/\sqrt{M}$ as $M$ grows large, or
proportionally to $1/N$ as the number of reflecting elements, $N$, grows large,
while still maintaining a non-zero rate.
  By capitalizing on the derived expression of the data rate under the
statistical knowledge of the CSI, we maximize the minimum user rate by
designing the passive beamforming at the RIS.
  Numerical results confirm that, even in the presence of imperfect CSI, the
integration of an RIS in massive MIMO systems results in promising performance
gains. In addition, the obtained results reveal that it is favorable to place
the RIS close to the users rather than close to the BS.

estimation approaches. However, most of these approaches can only handle either
day-time or night-time images, while their performance degrades for all-day
images due to large domain shift and the variation of illumination between day
and night images. To relieve these limitations, we propose a domain-separated
network for self-supervised depth estimation of all-day images. Specifically,
to relieve the negative influence of disturbing terms (illumination, etc.), we
partition the information of day and night image pairs into two complementary
sub-spaces: private and invariant domains, where the former contains the unique
information (illumination, etc.) of day and night images and the latter
contains essential shared information (texture, etc.). Meanwhile, to guarantee
that the day and night images contain the same information, the
domain-separated network takes the day-time images and corresponding night-time
images (generated by GAN) as input, and the private and invariant feature
extractors are learned by orthogonality and similarity loss, where the domain
gap can be alleviated, thus better depth maps can be expected. Meanwhile, the
reconstruction and photometric losses are utilized to estimate complementary
information and depth maps effectively. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation results for all-day
images on the challenging Oxford RobotCar dataset, proving the superiority of
our proposed approach.

the action of in-phase spanwise wall oscillations by computing properties of

measures are used to quantify the chosen control strategy on
laminar-to-turbulent transition: the kinetic energy of edge states (local
attractors on the edge of chaos), the form of the minimal seed (least energetic
perturbation on the edge of chaos), and the laminarization probability (the
probability that a random perturbation from the laminar flow of given kinetic
energy will laminarize). A novel Bayesian approach is introduced to enable the
accurate computation of the laminarization probability at a fraction of the
cost of previous methods. While the edge state and the minimal seed provide
useful information about the dynamics of transition to turbulence, neither
measure is particularly useful to judge the effectiveness of the control
strategy since they are not representative of the global geometry of the edge.
In contrast, the laminarization probability provides global information about
the edge and can be used to evaluate the control effectiveness by computing a
laminarization score (the expected laminarization probability) and the
associated expected dissipation rate of the controlled flow. These two
quantities allow for the determination of optimal control parameter values
subject to desired constraints. The results discussed in the paper are expected
to be applied to a wide range of transitional flows and control strategies

$\|\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}-\boldsymbol{\beta}^*\|_2$ for a Chebyshev estimator
$\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$, in a regression setting with uniformly distributed
noise $\varepsilon_i\sim U([-a,a])$ where $a$ is either known or unknown. With
relatively mild assumptions on the (random) design matrix $\mathbf{X}$, we can
bound the error rate by $\frac{C_p}{n}$ with high probability, for some
constant $C_p$ depending on the dimension $p$ and the law of the design.
Furthermore, we illustrate that there exist designs for which the Chebyshev
estimator is (nearly) minimax optimal. On the other hand we also argue that
there exist designs for which this estimator behaves sub-optimally in terms of
the constant $C_p$'s dependence on $p$. In addition we show that ""Chebyshev's
LASSO"" has advantages over the regular LASSO in high dimensional situations,
provided that the noise is uniform. Specifically, we argue that it achieves a
much faster rate of estimation under certain assumptions on the growth rate of
the sparsity level and the ambient dimension with respect to the sample size.

additive regression trees (BART). In the semi-parametric BART paradigm, the
response variable is approximated by a linear predictor and a BART model, where
the linear component is responsible for estimating the main effects and BART
accounts for non-specified interactions and non-linearities. Previous
semi-parametric models based on BART have assumed that the set of covariates in
the linear predictor and the BART model are mutually exclusive in an attempt to
avoid poor coverage properties and reduce bias in the estimates of the
parameters in the linear predictor. The main novelty in our approach lies in
the way we change the tree-generation moves in BART to deal with this bias and
resolve non-identifiability issues between the parametric and non-parametric
components, even when they have covariates in common. This allows us to model
complex interactions involving the covariates of primary interest, both among
themselves and with those in the BART component. Our novel method is developed
with a view to analysing data from an international education assessment, where
certain predictors of students' achievements in mathematics are of particular
interpretational interest. Through additional simulation studies and another
application to a well-known benchmark dataset, we also show competitive
performance when compared to regression models, alternative formulations of

regard, recently twisting of bilayer van der Waals (vdW)-bounded
two-dimensional (2D) materials has attracted much attention, because the
reduction of Brillouin zone will eventually lead to a diminishing kinetic
energy. Alternatively, one may start with a 2D Kagome lattice, which already
possesses flat bands at the Fermi level, but unfortunately these bands connect
quadratically to other (dispersive) bands, leading to undesirable effects.
Here, we propose, by first-principles calculation and tight-binding modeling,
that the same bilayer twisting approach can be used to isolate the Kagome flat
bands. As the starting kinetic energy is already vanishingly small, the
interlayer vdW potential is always sufficiently large irrespective of the
twisting angle. As such the electronic states in the (connected) flat bands
become unstable against a spontaneous Wigner crystallization, which is expected
to have interesting interplays with other flat-band phenomena such as novel
superconductivity and anomalous quantum Hall effect.

formulation of learning whereby the goal is minimizing the global empirical
loss. Frequentist learning, however, is known to be problematic in the regime
of limited data as it fails to quantify epistemic uncertainty in prediction.
Bayesian learning provides a principled solution to this problem by shifting
the optimization domain to the space of distribution in the model parameters.
{\color{black}This paper proposes a novel mechanism for the efficient
implementation of Bayesian learning in wireless systems. Specifically, we focus
on a standard gradient-based Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, namely
Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC), and we introduce a novel protocol, termed Wireless
Federated LMC (WFLMC), that is able to repurpose channel noise for the double
role of seed randomness for MCMC sampling and of privacy preservation.} To this
end, based on the analysis of the Wasserstein distance between sample
distribution and global posterior distribution under privacy and power
constraints, we introduce a power allocation strategy as the solution of a
convex program. The analysis identifies distinct operating regimes in which the
performance of the system is power-limited, privacy-limited, or limited by the
requirement of MCMC sampling. Both analytical and simulation results
demonstrate that, if the channel noise is properly accounted for under suitable
conditions, it can be fully repurposed for both MCMC sampling and privacy
preservation, obtaining the same performance as in an ideal communication
setting that is not subject to privacy constraints.

echoes recorded by the Canadian Meteor Orbit Radar (CMOR). The amplitude-time
profile of each echo was fit to our model using three different choices for the

electron density varied from the trail axis as an exponential-parabolic
distribution. While fewer than 5% of all examined echoes had self-consistent
fits, the estimates of r0 and D as a function of height obtained were broadly
similar to earlier studies, though with considerable scatter. Most meteor

and angular momentum mediated by photons. Using the nonequilibrium Green's
function method, we propose a unified Meir-Wingreen formalism for the energy
emitted, force experienced, and torque experienced by the objects due to the
fluctuating electromagnetic field. Our theory does not require the local
thermal equilibrium that is the central assumption of the conventional theory
of fluctuational electrodynamics (FE). The obtained formulas are valid for
arbitrary objects as well as the environment without the requirement of
reciprocity. To show the capability of our microscopic theory, we apply the
general formulas to transport problems of graphene edges in both equilibrium
and nonequilibrium situations. We show the local equilibrium energy radiation
of graphene obeys the well-known $T^4$ law with a converged theoretical
emissivity of 2.058$\%$. In the ballistic nonequilibrium situation driven by
chemical potential biases, we observe nonzero results for force and torque from
the graphene edges, which go beyond the predictive ability of the FE theory.
Our method is general and efficient for large systems, which paves the way for
studying more complex transport phenomena in the nonequilibrium regime.

automatic diagnostic systems for computed tomography (CT) have achieved many

annotations, which are often scarce in practice. This drives our interest to
the unsupervised representation learning. \emph{Introduction}. Recent studies
have shown that self-supervised learning is an effective approach for learning
representations, but most of them rely on the empirical design of
transformations and pretext tasks. \emph{Methods}. To avoid the subjectivity
associated with these methods, we propose the MVCNet, a novel unsupervised
three dimensional (3D) representation learning method working in a
transformation-free manner. We view each 3D lesion from different orientations
to collect multiple two dimensional (2D) views. Then, an embedding function is
learned by minimizing a contrastive loss so that the 2D views of the same 3D
lesion are aggregated, and the 2D views of different lesions are separated. We
evaluate the representations by training a simple classification head upon the
embedding layer. \emph{Results}. Experimental results show that MVCNet achieves
state-of-the-art accuracies on the LIDC-IDRI (89.55\%), LNDb (77.69\%) and
TianChi (79.96\%) datasets for \emph{unsupervised representation learning}.
When fine-tuned on 10\% of the labeled data, the accuracies are comparable to
the supervised learning model (89.46\% vs. 85.03\%, 73.85\% vs. 73.44\%,
83.56\% vs. 83.34\% on the three datasets, respectively). \emph{Conclusion}.
Results indicate the superiority of MVCNet in \emph{learning representations
with limited annotations}.

Vadhan [FOCS '10] proved that this gap is inherent, showing upper bounds on the

the development of next-generation data-driven surrogate models for turbulent

super-resolution flow network. SURFNet primarily trains the DL model on
low-resolution datasets and transfer learns the model on a handful of
high-resolution flow problems - accelerating the traditional numerical solver
independent of the input size. We propose two approaches to transfer learning
for the task of super-resolution, namely one-shot and incremental learning.
Both approaches entail transfer learning on only one geometry to account for
fine-grid flow fields requiring 15x less training data on high-resolution
inputs compared to the tiny resolution (64x256) of the coarse model,
significantly reducing the time for both data collection and training. We
empirically evaluate SURFNet's performance by solving the Navier-Stokes
equations in the turbulent regime on input resolutions up to 256x larger than
the coarse model. On four test geometries and eight flow configurations unseen
during training, we observe a consistent 2-2.1x speedup over the OpenFOAM
physics solver independent of the test geometry and the resolution size (up to
2048x2048), demonstrating both resolution-invariance and generalization
capabilities. Our approach addresses the challenge of reconstructing

and exploiting deep generative models. Recently, SeFa tries to find latent
disentangled directions by performing SVD on the first projection of a
pre-trained GAN. However, it is only applied to the first layer and works in a
post-processing way. Hessian Penalty minimizes the off-diagonal entries of the
output's Hessian matrix to facilitate disentanglement, and can be applied to
multi-layers.However, it constrains each entry of output independently, making
it not sufficient in disentangling the latent directions (e.g., shape, size,
rotation, etc.) of spatially correlated variations. In this paper, we propose a
simple Orthogonal Jacobian Regularization (OroJaR) to encourage deep generative
model to learn disentangled representations. It simply encourages the variation
of output caused by perturbations on different latent dimensions to be
orthogonal, and the Jacobian with respect to the input is calculated to
represent this variation. We show that our OroJaR also encourages the output's
Hessian matrix to be diagonal in an indirect manner. In contrast to the Hessian
Penalty, our OroJaR constrains the output in a holistic way, making it very
effective in disentangling latent dimensions corresponding to spatially

strategy. Although many methods for query strategies have been proposed in the
past, no clear superior method that works well in general for all domains has
been found yet. Additionally, many strategies are computationally expensive
which further hinders the widespread use of AL for large-scale annotation
projects.
  We, therefore, propose ImitAL, a novel query strategy, which encodes AL as a
learning-to-rank problem. For training the underlying neural network we chose
Imitation Learning. The required demonstrative expert experience for training
is generated from purely synthetic data.
  To show the general and superior applicability of \ImitAL{}, we perform an
extensive evaluation comparing our strategy on 15 different datasets, from a
wide range of domains, with 10 different state-of-the-art query strategies. We
also show that our approach is more runtime performant than most other
strategies, especially on very large datasets.

  Graph Drawing and Network Visualization (GD 2021)",,,,"cs.DM math.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Sprouts is a two-player pencil-and-paper game invented by John Conway and
Michael Paterson in 1967. In the game, the players take turns in joining dots
by curves according to simple rules, until one player cannot make a move. The
game of Sprouts is very popular and simple-looking, so it may come as a
surprise that there are essentially no AI Sprouts players available. This lack
of computer opponents is caused by the fact that the game hides a surprisingly
high combinatorial complexity and implementing it involves fascinating
programming challenges.
  We overcome all the implementation barriers and create the first
user-friendly Sprouts application with a strong artificial intelligence after
more than 50 years of the existence of the game. In particular, we combine
results from the theory of nimbers with new methods based on Delaunay
triangulations and crossing-preserving force-directed algorithms to develop an
AI Sprouts player which plays a perfect game on up to 11 spots.

in our work, the conventional computational ghost imaging results,
reconstructed imaging results using white noise and pink noise via deep
learning are compared under multiple sampling rates at different noise
conditions. We show that the proposed scheme can provide high-quality images
with a sampling rate of 0.8% even when the object is outside the training
dataset, and it is robust to noisy environments. This method is excellent for
various applications, particularly those that require a low sampling rate, fast
reconstruction efficiency, or experience strong noise interference.

  International Conference on Holography, String Theory and Discrete Approach,
  Hanoi, Vietnam, 2020",,,,"hep-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We review the results of refs. [1,2], in which the entanglement entropy in
spaces with horizons, such as Rindler or de Sitter space, is computed using
holography. This is achieved through an appropriate slicing of anti-de Sitter
space and the implementation of a UV cutoff. When the entangling surface
coincides with the horizon of the boundary metric, the entanglement entropy can
be identified with the standard gravitational entropy of the space. For this to
hold, the effective Newton's constant must be defined appropriately by
absorbing the UV cutoff. Conversely, the UV cutoff can be expressed in terms of
the effective Planck mass and the number of degrees of freedom of the dual
theory. For de Sitter space, the entropy is equal to the Wald entropy for an
effective action that includes the higher-curvature terms associated with the
conformal anomaly. The entanglement entropy takes the expected form of the de
Sitter entropy, including logarithmic corrections.

  Computing",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider a mobile edge computing scenario where users want to perform a
linear inference operation $\boldsymbol{W} \boldsymbol{x}$ on local data
$\boldsymbol{x}$ for some network-side matrix $\boldsymbol{W}$. The inference
is performed in a distributed fashion over multiple servers at the network
edge. For this scenario, we propose a coding scheme that combines a rateless
code to provide resiliency against straggling servers--hence reducing the
computation latency--and an irregular-repetition code to provide spatial
diversity--hence reducing the communication latency. We further derive a lower
bound on the total latency--comprising computation latency, communication
latency, and decoding latency. The proposed scheme performs remarkably close to
the bound and yields significantly lower latency than the scheme based on
maximum distance separable codes recently proposed by Zhang and Simeone.

that the C/O distribution is not described by a simple radial dependence. The
transport of icy pebbles has been suggested to alter the local elemental
abundances in protoplanetary disks, through settling, drift and trapping in
pressure bumps resulting in a depletion of volatiles in the surface and an
increase of the elemental C/O. We combine all disks with spatially resolved
ALMA C$_2$H observations with high-resolution continuum images and constraints
on the CO snowline to determine if the C$_2$H emission is indeed related to the
location of the icy pebbles. We report a possible correlation between the
presence of a significant CO-icy dust reservoir and high C$_2$H emission, which
is only found in disks with dust rings outside the CO snowline. In contrast,
compact dust disks (without pressure bumps) and warm transition disks (with
their dust ring inside the CO snowline) are not detected in C$_2$H, suggesting
that such disks may never have contained a significant CO ice reservoir. This
correlation provides evidence for the regulation of the C/O profile by the
complex interplay of CO snowline and pressure bump locations in the disk. These
results demonstrate the importance of including dust transport in chemical disk
models, for a proper interpretation of exoplanet atmospheric compositions, and
a better understanding of volatile depletion in disks, in particular the use of
CO isotopologues to determine gas surface densities.

show that the solution either exists globally in time or blows up at finite

FCN encodes each object instance or stuff category with the proposed kernel

point-based annotation for weakly-supervised panoptic segmentation. It only
needs several random points for both things and stuff, which dramatically
reduces the annotation cost of human. The proposed Panoptic FCN is also proved
to have much superior performance in this weakly-supervised setting, which
achieves 82% of the fully-supervised performance with only 20 randomly
annotated points per instance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of Panoptic FCN on COCO, VOC 2012, Cityscapes, and

to account for obscuration along the polar directions, modeled as a foreground

short wavelengths or is much grayer. By comparing the results of different

  We find a similar fraction of sources with positive evidence for and against
polar dust. Applying statistical corrections, we estimate that half of our
sample could contain polar dust and among them, 60% exhibit a steep extinction
curve and 40% a flat extinction curve; although these latter percentages are
found to depend on the adopted extinction curves. The obscuration in the V-band
is not found to correlate with the X-ray column density, while A_V/N_H ratios
span a large range of values and higher dust temperatures are found with the
flat, rather than with the steep extinction curve. Ignoring this polar dust
component in the fit of the spectral energy distribution of these composite
systems leads to an overestimation of the stellar contribution. A single fit

overcomes this issue but it fails at identifying all the AGN with polar dust

understand where the roads lead, then get a car ...
  The renaissance of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) over the last
decade is accompanied by an unscalable computational cost, limiting its
advancement and weighing on the field in practice. In this thesis we take a
systematic approach to address the algorithmic and methodological limitations
at the root of these costs. We first demonstrate that DL training and pruning
are predictable and governed by scaling laws -- for state of the art models and
tasks, spanning image classification and language modeling, as well as for
state of the art model compression via iterative pruning. Predictability, via
the establishment of these scaling laws, provides the path for principled
design and trade-off reasoning, currently largely lacking in the field. We then
continue to analyze the sources of the scaling laws, offering an
approximation-theoretic view and showing through the exploration of a noiseless
realizable case that DL is in fact dominated by error sources very far from the
lower error limit. We conclude by building on the gained theoretical
understanding of the scaling laws' origins. We present a conjectural path to
eliminate one of the current dominant error sources -- through a data bandwidth
limiting hypothesis and the introduction of Nyquist learners -- which can, in
principle, reach the generalization error lower limit (e.g. 0 in the noiseless
case), at finite dataset size.

Appl. Phys. 126, 110902 (2019)]. However, since $\bar{g}$ is a constant it is
not able to provide local information about a particular atom in the system.
Furthermore, while $\overline{g}$ can be used only for periodic bulk solids, a
local (i.e., position-dependent) version would allow us to consider also
low-dimensional systems and interfaces. Such a local function has been proposed
by Rauch et al. [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 16, 2654 (2020)] for the local mBJ
potential. Actually, a local version of $\overline{g}$, or of another similar
quantity like the reduced density gradient $\overline{s}$, could also be used
in the framework of other methods. Here, we explored the idea to use such a
local function $\tilde{g}$ (or $\tilde{s}$), defined as the average of $g$ (or
$s$) over a certain region around a transition-metal atom, to estimate the
degree of on-site correlation on this atom. We found a large difference in our
correlation estimators between non-correlated and correlated materials, proving
its usefulness and reliability. Our estimators can subsequently be used to
determine whether or not a Hubbard $U$ on-site correction in the DFT+$U$ method
should be applied to a particular atom. This is particularly interesting in
cases where the degree of correlation of the transition-metal atoms is not
clear, like interfaces between correlated and non-correlated materials or
oxygen-covered metal surfaces. In such cases, our estimators could also be used
for an interpolation of $U$ between correlated and non-correlated atoms.

there exist stable circular orbits in this geometry for very small values of

$0<\alpha<<1$. We observe that if the values of $\gamma$ and $\alpha$ increase,
the test particle can more easily escape the gravitational field of the black

potential is just opposite to that of the $\gamma$ and $\alpha$. Further, we
investigate the quasi-periodic oscillations of test particles near the stable
circular orbits. With the increasing values of $Q$, the stable circular orbits
get away from the central object; therefore, one can observe lower epicyclic
frequencies away from the central gravitating source with the increase in the
values of $Q$. The redshift parameter $z$ of the photons emitted by the charged
test particles moving in the stable circular orbits around the central source
increases with an increase in the parameter $\alpha$ and decreases with an

we have found that the free motion of atoms can lead to other effects nonlinear
in atomic density $n$, using a previously unknown self-consistent solution of
the Maxwell-Bloch equations in the mean-field approximation for a gas of
two-level atoms with an optical transition at unperturbed frequency
$\omega^{}_0$. These effects distort the Doppler lineshape (shift, asymmetry,
broadening), but are not associated with an atom-atom interaction. In
particular, in the case of $nk^{-3}_0<1$ (where $k^{}_0=\omega^{}_0/c$) and
significant Doppler broadening (with respect to collisional broadening),
atomic-motion-induced nonlinear effects significantly exceed the well-known
influence of the dipole-dipole interatomic interaction (e.g., Lorentz-Lorenz
shift) by more than one order of magnitude. Moreover, under some conditions a
frequency interval appears in which a non-trivial self-consistent solution of
the Maxwell-Bloch equations is absent due to atomic motion effects. Thus, the
existing physical picture of spectroscopic effects nonlinear in atomic density

unsafe, callback-driven, error-prone and difficult-to-maintain code.
  We address this challenge by introducing $\texttt{SenseVM}$ - a
bytecode-interpreted virtual machine that provides a message-passing based
$\textit{higher-order concurrency}$ model, originally introduced by Reppy, for
microcontroller programming. This model treats synchronous operations as
first-class values (called $\texttt{Events}$) akin to the treatment of
first-class functions in functional languages. This primarily allows the
programmer to compose and tailor their own concurrency abstractions and,
additionally, abstracts away unsafe memory operations, common in shared-memory
concurrency models, thereby making microcontroller programs safer, composable
and easier-to-maintain.
  Our VM is made portable via a low-level $\textit{bridge}$ interface, built
atop the embedded OS - Zephyr. The bridge is implemented by all drivers and
designed such that programming in response to a software message or a hardware
interrupt remains uniform and indistinguishable. In this paper we demonstrate
the features of our VM through an example, written in a Caml-like functional
language, running on the $\texttt{nRF52840}$ and $\texttt{STM32F4}$

scheme to obtain reliable specialized models when data is imbalanced and
distributed in a non-i.i.d. (non-independent and identically distributed)
fashion amongst clients. While a similarity measure metric, like the cosine
similarity, can be used to endow groups of the client with a specialized model,
this process can be arduous as the server should involve all clients in each of
the federated learning rounds. Therefore, it is imperative that a subset of
clients is selected periodically due to the limited bandwidth and latency
constraints at the network edge. To this end, this paper proposes a new client
selection algorithm that aims to accelerate the convergence rate for obtaining
specialized machine learning models that achieve high test accuracies for all
client groups. Specifically, we introduce a client selection approach that
leverages the devices' heterogeneity to schedule the clients based on their
round latency and exploits the bandwidth reuse for clients that consume more
time to update the model. Then, the server performs model averaging and
clusters the clients based on predefined thresholds. When a specific cluster
reaches a stationary point, the proposed algorithm uses a greedy scheduling
algorithm for that group by selecting the clients with less latency to update
the model. Extensive experiments show that the proposed approach lowers the
training time and accelerates the convergence rate by up to 50% while imbuing
each client with a specialized model that is fit for its local data

models are two standards of mathematical biology important for the evolution of
populations. An agent based model is presented which reproduces these models
and then explores where these models agree and disagree under relaxed
specifications. For the population models, the requirement of homogeneous
mixing prevents prediction of extinctions due to local resource depletion.
These models also suggest equilibrium based on attainment of constant
population levels though underlying population characteristics may be nowhere
close to equilibrium. The discrete stochastic gene frequency models assume well
mixed populations at constant levels. The models' predictions for non-constant
populations in strongly oscillating and chaotic regimes are surprisingly good,
only diverging from the ABM at the most chaotic levels.

engineering, but it is very difficult to be determined. The current accepted
improvement is taking advantage of the depth phases, such as the pP, to
constrain this parameter. However, it is not easy to pick such a phase in a
seismogram from the other phases and the backgound noises. Here we propose the
use of the minimum entropy deconvolution (MED) to detect it. Synthetic tests
show that impulse(s) hidden in the seimic noises, eg. discrete unit impulses or
the Gaussian mono impulses, can be detected completely. Further, we assume that
the pP phase is an impulse-like signal buried in the Z component of the
seismogram and applied this technique to 12 earthquakes in the International
Association of Seismology and Physics (IASPEI) Ground Truth (GT) reference
events list. Results show that 9 out of 12 earthquakes have absolute errors of
less than 2.00 s for the travel-time differences of pP-P, and the maximum
absolute error is 3.06 s . This demonstrate that the assumption above is
reasonable, and this technique works well and effectively even for a single
seismogram. Due to its little cost and effectiveness, this technique may be
also useful in the starting points for other methods to detect pP phase.

attention for its high computation efficiency and low storage cost. However,
the existing approaches still have some limitations, which need to be explored.
1) A fixed hash length (e.g., 16bits or 32bits) is predefined before learning
the binary codes. Therefore, these models need to be retrained when the hash
length changes, that consumes additional computation power, reducing the
scalability in practical applications. 2) Existing cross-modal approaches only
explore the information in the original multimedia data to perform the hash
learning, without exploiting the semantic information contained in the learned
hash codes. To this end, we develop a novel Multiple hash cOdes jOint learNing

synchronously learns the hash codes with multiple lengths in a unified

solutions for infected subject detection using chest X-ray images have been
proposed. However, deep learning models usually need large labelled datasets to
be effective. Semi-supervised deep learning is an attractive alternative, where
unlabelled data is leveraged to improve the overall model's accuracy. However,
in real-world usage settings, an unlabelled dataset might present a different
distribution than the labelled dataset (i.e. the labelled dataset was sampled
from a target clinic and the unlabelled dataset from a source clinic). This
results in a distribution mismatch between the unlabelled and labelled
datasets. In this work, we assess the impact of the distribution mismatch
between the labelled and the unlabelled datasets, for a semi-supervised model
trained with chest X-ray images, for COVID-19 detection. Under strong
distribution mismatch conditions, we found an accuracy hit of almost 30\%,
suggesting that the unlabelled dataset distribution has a strong influence in
the behaviour of the model. Therefore, we propose a straightforward approach to
diminish the impact of such distribution mismatch. Our proposed method uses a
density approximation of the feature space. It is built upon the target dataset
to filter out the observations in the source unlabelled dataset that might harm
the accuracy of the semi-supervised model. It assumes that a small labelled
source dataset is available together with a larger source unlabelled dataset.
Our proposed method does not require any model training, it is simple and
computationally cheap. We compare our proposed method against two popular state
of the art out-of-distribution data detectors, which are also cheap and simple
to implement. In our tests, our method yielded accuracy gains of up to 32\%,
when compared to the previous state of the art methods.

algorithms. On a curved double lane road created according to this scenario,
MIT RACECAR has to follow the lanes and when it encounters an obstacle, it has
to change lanes without leaving the road and pass without hitting the obstacle.
In addition, an image processing algorithm was developed to obtain the position

detects the target point by processing the image taken from the ZED camera and
gives the target point information to the path planning algorithm.

meaningfully, one has to employ regularization methods. Traditionally, popular
regularization methods are the penalized Variational approaches. In recent
years, the classical regularization approaches have been outclassed by the
so-called plug-and-play (PnP) algorithms, which copy the proximal gradient
minimization processes, such as ADMM or FISTA, but with any general denoiser.
However, unlike the traditional proximal gradient methods, the theoretical
underpinnings, convergence, and stability results have been insufficient for
these PnP-algorithms. Hence, the results obtained from these algorithms, though
empirically outstanding, can't always be completely trusted, as they may
contain certain instabilities or (hallucinated) features arising from the
denoiser, especially when using a pre-trained learned denoiser. In fact, in
this paper, we show that a PnP-algorithm can induce hallucinated features, when
using a pre-trained deep-learning-based (DnCNN) denoiser. We show that such
instabilities are quite different than the instabilities inherent to an
ill-posed problem. We also present methods to subdue these instabilities and
significantly improve the recoveries. We compare the advantages and
disadvantages of a learned denoiser over a classical denoiser (here, BM3D), as
well as, the effectiveness of the FISTA-PnP algorithm vs. the ADMM-PnP
algorithm. In addition, we also provide an algorithm to combine these two
denoisers, the learned and the classical, in a weighted fashion to produce even
better results. We conclude with numerical results which validate the developed
theories.

Gauthier, Andrew Pomerance","High-Resolution Waveform Capture Device on a Cyclone-V FPGA",,,,,"cs.AR cs.SY eess.SY hep-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce the waveform capture device (WCD), a flexible measurement system
capable of recording complex digital signals on trillionth-of-a-second (ps)
time scales. The WCD is implemented via modular code on an off-the-shelf
field-programmable gate-array (FPGA, Intel/Altera Cyclone V), and incorporates
both time-to-digital converter (TDC) and digital storage oscilloscope (DSO)
functionality. The device captures a waveform by taking snapshots of a signal
as it propagates down an ultra-fast transmission line known as a carry chain
(CC). It is calibrated via a novel dynamic phase-shifting (DPS) method that
requires substantially less data and resources than the state-of-the-art. Using
DPS, we find the measurement resolution - or mean propagation delay from one CC
element to the next - to be 4.91 +/- 0.04 ps (4.54 +/- 0.02 ps) for a pulse of
logic high (low). Similarly, we find the single-shot precision - or mean error
on the timing of the waveform - to be 29.52 ps (27.14 ps) for pulses of logic
high (low). We verify these findings by reproducing commercial oscilloscope
measurements of asynchronous ring-oscillators on FPGAs, finding the mean pulse
width to be 0.240 +/- 0.002 ns per inverter gate. Finally, we present a careful
analysis of design constraints, introduce a novel error correction algorithm,
and sketch a simple extension to the analog domain. We also provide the Verilog
code instantiating the our design on an FPGA in an Appendix, and make our
methods available as an open-source Python library at

  Ku & Ka Bands","International Conference on Robotics,Electrical and Signal Processing
  Techniques (ICREST), 2018",,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the extensive use of lower frequency bands & huge demand of large
bandwidth in satellite communications, engineers need to use the higher
frequency bands such as Ku to Ka bands. However, the rain attenuation is severe
in these bands. Before installing an earth station, the estimation of the rain
attenuation is a prerequisite task to know the required fade margin to ensure a
certain availability of the network. In this paper, we estimate the rain
attenuation for different regions of Nepal. The R-H and ITU models are used for
rain rate and rain attenuation estimation, respectively. A significant temporal
and spatial variation in rain attenuation is observed. Among three different
regions of Nepal, namely Terai, Hilly, and Himalaya, while the maximum rain
attenuation is found in Terai region, the minimum is in Himalaya. Jhapa of the
Terai region experiences the highest attenuation and requires 80 dB and 24 dB
fade margin for Ka and Ku bands, respectively. Solukhumbu of Himalaya region,
on the other hand, is found to be the least rain attenuation affected site. The
required fade margin for an earth station site in Solukhumbu for using Ku and
Ka bands are 12 dB and 40 dB, respectively. The minimum attenuation, which is
observed in November and December, is several times lower compared to the
highest rain attenuation, observed in July. The minimum attenuation caused by
the Ka band is higher than the maximum attenuation caused by the Ku band
irrespective of the locations of the earth station sites.

  Case With One-Dimensional PN Junctions",,,,,"physics.app-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Thermophotonics (TPX) is a technology close to thermophotovoltaics (TPV),
where a heated light-emitting diode (LED) is used as the active thermal emitter
of the system. It allows to tune the heat flux, by means of
electroluminescence, to a spectral range matching better the gap of a
photovoltaic cell. The concept is extended to near-field thermophotonics
(NF-TPX), where enhanced energy conversion is due to both electric control and
wave tunneling. We perform a thorough numerical analysis of a GaAs-based NF-TPX
device, by coupling a near-field radiative heat transfer solver based on
fluctuational electrodynamics with an algorithm based on a simplified version
of the drift-diffusion equations in 1D. This allows for the investigation of
the emission and absorption profiles in the LED and the photovoltaic (PV) cell,
and for the scrutiny of the impact of key parameters. We also demonstrate that
the performance obtained with this algorithm can approach idealized cases for
improved devices. For the considered simplified architecture and 300 K
temperature difference, we find a power density output of 1 W.cm--2 ,
underlining the potential for waste heat harvesting close to ambient
temperature.
