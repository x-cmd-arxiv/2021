  Universal Trees","30 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.DS cs.DM cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Parity games have witnessed several new quasi-polynomial algorithms since the
breakthrough result of Calude et al. (2017). The central combinatorial object
underlying these approaches is a universal tree, as identified by Czerwi\'nski
et al. (2019). By providing a quasi-polynomial lower bound on the size of
universal trees, they have highlighted a barrier that must be overcome by all
existing approaches to attain polynomial runtime. This is due to the existence
of worst case instances which force these algorithms to explore a large portion
of the tree.
  As an attempt to overcome this barrier, we propose a strategy iteration
framework which can be applied on any universal tree. It is at least as fast as
its value iteration counterparts, while allowing one to take bigger leaps in
the universal tree. Value iteration - asymptotically the fastest known
algorithm for parity games - is a repeated application of operators associated
with arcs in the game graph to obtain the least fixed point. Our main technical
contribution is an efficient method for computing the least fixed point of
operators associated with arcs in a strategy subgraph. This is achieved via a
careful adaptation of shortest path algorithms to the setting of ordered trees.
By plugging in the universal tree of Jurdzi\'nski and Lazi\'c (2017), or the
Strahler universal tree of Daviaud et al. (2020), we obtain instantiations of
the general framework that take time $O(mn^2\log n\log d)$ and $O(mn^2\log^3 n
\log d)$ respectively per iteration.

applications on mobile devices. To achieve high accuracy, DNN models have
become increasingly deep with hundreds or even thousands of operator layers,
leading to high memory and computational requirements for inference. Operator
fusion (or kernel/layer fusion) is key optimization in many state-of-the-art
DNN execution frameworks, such as TensorFlow, TVM, and MNN. However, these
frameworks usually adopt fusion approaches based on certain patterns that are
too restrictive to cover the diversity of operators and layer connections.
Polyhedral-based loop fusion techniques, on the other hand, work on a low-level
view of the computation without operator-level information, and can also miss
potential fusion opportunities. To address this challenge, this paper proposes
a novel and extensive loop fusion framework called DNNFusion. The basic idea of
this work is to work at an operator view of DNNs, but expand fusion
opportunities by developing a classification of both individual operators and
their combinations. In addition, DNNFusion includes 1) a novel
mathematical-property-based graph rewriting framework to reduce evaluation
costs and facilitate subsequent operator fusion, 2) an integrated fusion plan
generation that leverages the high-level analysis and accurate light-weight
profiling, and 3) additional optimizations during fusion code generation.
DNNFusion is extensively evaluated on 15 DNN models with varied types of tasks,
model sizes, and layer counts. The evaluation results demonstrate that
DNNFusion finds up to 8.8x higher fusion opportunities, outperforms four
state-of-the-art DNN execution frameworks with 9.3x speedup. The memory
requirement reduction and speedups can enable the execution of many of the
target models on mobile devices and even make them part of a real-time
application.

which postulates a deep and powerful connection between the stochastic
thermodynamics of self-organization and learning through variational inference.
Specifically, it claims that any self-organizing system which can be
statistically separated from its environment, and which maintains itself at a
non-equilibrium steady state, can be construed as minimizing an
information-theoretic functional -- the variational free energy -- and thus
performing variational Bayesian inference to infer the hidden state of its
environment. This principle has also been applied extensively in neuroscience,
and is beginning to make inroads in machine learning by spurring the
construction of novel and powerful algorithms by which action, perception, and
learning can all be unified under a single objective. While its expansive and
often grandiose claims have spurred significant debates in both philosophy and
theoretical neuroscience, the mathematical depth and lack of accessible
introductions and tutorials for the core claims of the theory have often
precluded a deep understanding within the literature. Here, we aim to provide a
mathematically detailed, yet intuitive walk-through of the formulation and

generalizability typically requires a substantial amount of labeled data,
spanning a broad range of variation. This data-labeling process can be both
labor and cost intensive. To achieve desirable predictive performance, a
trained model is typically applied into a domain where the data distribution is
similar to the training dataset. However, for many agricultural machine
learning problems, training datasets are collected at a specific location,
during a specific period in time of the growing season. Since agricultural
systems exhibit substantial variability in terms of crop type, cultivar,
management, seasonal growth dynamics, lighting condition, sensor type, etc, a
model trained from one dataset often does not generalize well across domains.
To enable more data efficient and generalizable neural network models in
agriculture, we propose a method that generates photorealistic agricultural
images from a synthetic 3D crop model domain into real world crop domains. The
method uses a semantically constrained GAN (generative adversarial network) to
preserve the fruit position and geometry. We observe that a baseline CycleGAN
method generates visually realistic target domain images but does not preserve
fruit position information while our method maintains fruit positions well.
Image generation results in vineyard grape day and night images show the visual
outputs of our network are much better compared to a baseline network.
Incremental training experiments in vineyard grape detection tasks show that
the images generated from our method can significantly speed the domain
adaption process, increase performance for a given number of labeled images
(i.e. data efficiency), and decrease labeling requirements.

In the 25 years since, the subject has blossomed to include many related
phenomena. The focus of this short note is to survey the conceptual influence
of the concept of a ""production-dissipation (input-output) energy balance"" that
they identified. Our recent results on nonlinear periodic waves as dissipative
solitons (in a model equation for a ferrofluid interface in a parallel-flow
rectangular geometry subject to an inhomogeneous magnetic field) have shown
that the classical concept also applies to nonlocalized (specifically,
spatially periodic) nonlinear coherent structures. Thus, we revisit the
so-called KdV-KSV equation studied by C. I. Christov and M. G. Velarde to
demonstrate that it also possesses spatially periodic dissipative soliton
solutions. These coherent structures arise when the linearly unstable flat film
state evolves to sufficiently large amplitude. The linear instability is then
arrested when the nonlinearity saturates, leading to permanent traveling waves.
Although the two model equations considered in this short note feature the same
prototypical linear long-wave instability mechanism, along with similar linear
dispersion, their nonlinearities are fundamentally different. These nonlinear
terms set the shape and eventual dynamics of the nonlinear periodic waves.
Intriguingly, the nonintegrable equations discussed in this note also exhibit
multiperiodic nonlinear wave solutions, akin to the polycnoidal waves discussed
by J. P. Boyd in the context of the completely integrable KdV equation.

for the global division of work. Remote work could connect labour markets, but
it could also increase spatial polarisation. However, our understanding of the
geographies of remote work is limited. Specifically, does remote work bring
jobs to rural areas or is it concentrating in large cities, and how do skill
requirements affect competition for jobs and wages? We use data from a fully
remote labour market - an online labour platform - to show that remote work is
polarised along three dimensions. First, countries are globally divided: North
American, European, and South Asian remote workers attract most jobs, while
many Global South countries participate only marginally. Secondly, remote jobs
are pulled to urban regions; rural areas fall behind. Thirdly, remote work is
polarised along the skill axis: workers with in-demand skills attract
profitable jobs, while others face intense competition and obtain low wages.
The findings suggest that remote work is shaped by agglomerative forces, which
are deepening the gap between urban and rural areas. To make remote work an
effective tool for rural development, it needs to be embedded in local
skill-building and labour market programmes.

well-sampled jet features show either accelerated or non-radial motion. In 47
jets there is at least one non-accelerating feature with an unusually slow
apparent speed. Most of the jets show variations of 10 to 50 deg in their inner
jet position angle (PA) over time, although the overall distribution has a
continuous tail out to 200 deg. AGN with SEDs peaked at lower frequencies tend
to have more variable PAs, with BL Lacs being less variable than quasars. The
Fermi LAT gamma-ray associated AGN also tend to have more variable PAs than the
non-LAT AGN in our sample. We attribute these trends to smaller viewing angles
for the lower spectral peaked and LAT-associated jets. We identified 13 AGN
where multiple features emerge over decade-long periods at systematically
increasing or decreasing PAs. Since the ejected features do not fill the entire
jet cross-section, this behavior is indicative of a precessing flow instability
near the jet base. Although some jets show indications of oscillatory PA
evolution, we claim no bona fide cases of periodicity since the fitted periods
are comparable to the total VLBA time coverage.

However, delineating different tissue regions manually is a laborious,
time-consuming and costly task that requires expert knowledge. On the other
hand, the state-of-the-art automatic deep learning models for semantic
segmentation require lots of annotated training data and there are only a
limited number of tissue region annotated images publicly available. To obviate
this issue in computational pathology projects and collect large-scale region
annotations efficiently, we propose an efficient interactive segmentation
network that requires minimum input from the user to accurately annotate
different tissue types in the histology image. The user is only required to
draw a simple squiggle inside each region of interest so it will be used as the
guiding signal for the model. To deal with the complex appearance and amorph
geometry of different tissue regions we introduce several automatic and
minimalistic guiding signal generation techniques that help the model to become
robust against the variation in the user input. By experimenting on a dataset
of breast cancer images, we show that not only does our proposed method speed
up the interactive annotation process, it can also outperform the existing

ruling the dynamics of the internal degrees of freedom becomes unitary and

holographic traffic data, would be a breakthrough, for it could reproduce every
detail of the traffic flow evolution and reveal the personal mobility pattern
within the city. Due to the high coverage of Automatic Vehicle Identification
(AVI) devices in Xuancheng city, we constructed one-month continuous
trajectories of daily 80,000 vehicles in the city with accurate intersection
passing time and no travel path estimation bias. With such holographic traffic
data, it is possible to reproduce every detail of the traffic flow evolution.
We presented a set of traffic flow data based on the holographic trajectories
resampling, covering the whole 482 road segments in the city round the clock,
including stationary average speed and flow data of 5-minute intervals and
dynamic floating car data.

transfer using devices that support both storage and logic. Stateful logic
techniques such as IMPLY, MAGIC and FELIX can perform logic gates within
memristive crossbar arrays with massive parallelism. Multiplication via
stateful logic is an active field of research due to the wide implications.
Recently, RIME has become the state-of-the-art algorithm for stateful
single-row multiplication by using memristive partitions, reducing the latency
of the previous state-of-the-art by 5.1x. In this paper, we begin by proposing
novel partition-based computation techniques for broadcasting and shifting
data. Then, we design an in-memory multiplication algorithm based on the
carry-save add-shift (CSAS) technique. Finally, we develop a novel stateful
full-adder that significantly improves the state-of-the-art (FELIX) design.
These contributions constitute MultPIM, a multiplier that reduces
state-of-the-art time complexity from quadratic to linear-log. For 32-bit
numbers, MultPIM improves latency by an additional 4.2x over RIME, while even
slightly reducing area overhead. Furthermore, we optimize MultPIM for
full-precision matrix-vector multiplication and improve latency by 25.5x over

segmentation. Approaches based on click-level annotations have therefore
attracted increasing attention due to their superior trade-off between
supervision and annotation cost. In this paper, we propose seminar learning, a
new learning paradigm for semantic segmentation with click-level supervision.
The fundamental rationale of seminar learning is to leverage the knowledge from
different networks to compensate for insufficient information provided in
click-level annotations. Mimicking a seminar, our seminar learning involves a
teacher-student and a student-student module, where a student can learn from
both skillful teachers and other students. The teacher-student module uses a
teacher network based on the exponential moving average to guide the training
of the student network. In the student-student module, heterogeneous
pseudo-labels are proposed to bridge the transfer of knowledge among students
to enhance each other's performance. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of seminar learning, which achieves the new state-of-the-art
performance of 72.51% (mIOU), surpassing previous methods by a large margin of
up to 16.88% on the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset.

such that the nodal values are the design variables to be identified.
Independent FE analysis and material discretization, as well as flexible
incorporation of experimental data, offer high robustness and control. Three
elementary test cases and one application example, which exhibit large

bending, sheet inflation, and abdominal wall pressurization. Experiment-like
results are generated from high-resolution simulations with the subsequent
addition of up to 4% noise. Local optimization based on the trust-region

algorithm is capable to reconstruct material distributions with high precision

facilitating its extension to other material models, optimization algorithms

Galactic halo. However, most substructures host no stars and can only be
detected indirectly. Stellar streams present a promising probe of this dark
substructure. These streams arise from tidally stripped star clusters or dwarf
galaxies, and their low dynamical temperature and negligible self-gravity give
them a sharp memory of gravitational perturbations caused by passing dark
substructures. For this reason, perturbed stellar streams have been the subject
of substantial study. While previous studies have been largely numerical, we
show here that in the diffusion regime -- where stream stars are subjected to
many small velocity kicks -- stream perturbations can be understood on a fully
analytic level. In particular, we derive how the (three-dimensional) power
spectrum of the substructure density field determines the power spectrum of the
(one-dimensional) density of a stellar stream. Our analytic description
supplies a clear picture of the behaviour of stream perturbations in response
to a perturbing environment, which may include contributions from both dark and
luminous substructure. In particular, stream perturbations grow in amplitude
initially, settle into a steady state, and ultimately decay. By directly
relating stellar stream perturbations to the surrounding matter distribution,
this analytic framework represents a versatile new tool for probing the nature
of dark matter through astrophysical observations.

question of their impact onto the monopole moment of the galaxy power spectrum,
$P_0(k)$. Specifically, we use an upgraded numerical implementation of the
LIGER method to generate $140$ mock galaxy density fields for a full
Euclid-like survey and we measure $P_0(k)$ in each of them utilising a standard
estimator. We compare the spectra obtained by turning on and off different
effects. Our results show that wide-angle effects due to radial peculiar
velocities generate excess power above the level expected within the
plane-parallel approximation. They are detectable with a signal-to-noise ratio
of 2.7 for $k<0.02\,h$ Mpc$^{-1}$. Weak-lensing magnification also produces
additional power on large scales which, if the current favourite model for the
luminosity function of H$\alpha$ emitters turns out to be realistic, can only
be detected with a signal-to-noise ratio of 1.3 at best. Finally, we
demonstrate that measuring $P_0(k)$ in the standard of rest of the observer
generates an additive component reflecting the kinematic dipole overdensity
caused by the peculiar velocity. This component is characterised by a damped
oscillatory pattern on large scales. We show that this `finger of the observer'
effect is detectable in some redshift bins and suggest that its measurement
could possibly open new research directions in connection with the
determination of the cosmological parameters, the properties of the galaxy

We apply two independent full-spectral-fitting approaches, measuring a total
metallicity, [Z/H]=$-0.13\pm0.08$ with Bagpipes, and [Z/H]=$0.04\pm0.14$ with
Alf, a fall of $\sim0.2-0.3$ dex compared with the local Universe. We also
measure an iron abundance, [Fe/H] =$-0.18\pm0.08$, a fall of $\sim0.15$ dex

magnesium abundance, obtaining [Mg/Fe]=$0.23\pm$0.12, consistent with
similar-mass galaxies in the local Universe, indicating no evolution in the
average alpha enhancement of log$(M_*/\rm{M_\odot})=11$ quiescent galaxies over
the last $\sim8$ Gyr. This suggests the very high alpha enhancements recently
reported for several bright $z\sim1-2$ quiescent galaxies are due to their
extreme masses, log$(M_*/\rm{M_\odot})\gtrsim11.5$, rather than being typical
of the $z\gtrsim1$ population. The metallicity evolution we observe with
redshift (falling [Z/H], [Fe/H], constant [Mg/Fe]) is consistent with recent
studies. We recover a mean stellar age of $2.5^{+0.6}_{-0.4}$ Gyr,
corresponding to a formation redshift, $z_\rm{form}=2.4^{+0.6}_{-0.3}$. Recent
studies have obtained varying average formation redshifts for $z\gtrsim1$
massive quiescent galaxies, and, as these studies report consistent
metallicities, we identify different star-formation-history models as the most
likely cause. Larger spectroscopic samples from upcoming ground-based
instruments will provide precise constraints on ages and metallicities at
$z\gtrsim1$. Combining these with precise JWST $z>2$ quiescent-galaxy

feasibility has been debated for a long time, with the promise of
reconstructing the detailed star-formation history of a large fraction of stars

  We investigate the feasibility of strong chemical tagging using known member
stars of open clusters.
  We analysed the largest sample of cluster members that have been
homogeneously characterised with high-resolution differential abundances for 16
different elements. We also investigated the possibility of finding the known
clusters in the APOGEE DR16 red clump sample with 18 chemical species. For both
purposes, we used a clustering algorithm and an unsupervised dimensionality
reduction technique to blindly search for groups of stars in chemical space.
  Even if the internal coherence of the stellar abundances in the same cluster
is high, typically 0.03 dex, the overlap in the chemical signatures of the
clusters is large. In the sample with the highest precision and no field stars,
we only recover 9 out of the 31 analysed clusters at a 40% threshold of
homogeneity and precision. This ratio slightly increases when we only use
clusters with 7 or more members. In the APOGEE sample, field stars are present
along with four populated clusters. In this case, only one of the open clusters
was moderately recovered.
  In our best-case scenario, more than 70% of the groups of stars are in fact
statistical groups that contain stars belonging to different real clusters.
This indicates that the chances of recovering the majority of birth clusters
dissolved in the field are slim, even with the most advanced clustering
techniques. We show that different stellar birth sites can have overlapping

phase of a supernova blast wave expansion in dense red supergiant winds. We
solve in spherical geometry a system combining a diffusive-convection equation
which treats cosmic-ray dynamics coupled to magnetohydrodynamics to follow gas
dynamics. The fast shock expanding in a dense ionized wind is able to trigger
the fast non-resonant streaming instability over day timescales, and energizes
cosmic-rays even under the effect of p-p losses. We find that such environments
make the blast wave a Pevatron, although the maximum energy depends on various
parameters such as the injection rate and mass-loss rate of the winds.
Multi-PeV energies can be reached if the progenitor mass loss rates are of the
order of $10^{-3}$ Msun yr$^{-1}$. It has been recently invoked that, prior to
the explosion, hydrogen rich massive stars can produce enhanced mass loss
rates. These enhanced rates would then favor the production of a Pevatron phase

by the interaction with the surrounding stars and gas. While stellar
interactions are found to always shrink the binary, recent studies predict the
possibility of binary outspiral mediated by the presence of a gaseous disk,
which could endlessly delay the coalescence and impact the merger rates of
massive binaries. Here we implement a semi-analytical treatment that follows
the binary evolution under the combined effect of stars and gas. We find that
binaries may outspiral only if they accrete near or above their Eddington limit
and only until their separation reaches the gaseous disk self-gravitating
radius. Even in case of an outspiral, the binary eventually reaches a large
enough mass for GW to take over and drive it to coalescence. The combined
action of stellar hardening, mass growth and GW-driven inspiral brings binaries
to coalescence in few hundreds Myr at most, implying that gas-driven expansion
will not severely affect the detection prospects of upcoming GW facilities.

Using near-IR high-resolution spectra from Gemini/IGRINS, we obtain a projected
rotational velocity of $v\sin{i_p}$ = 9.5 $\pm$ 0.2 km/s for HD 106906 b. This
measurement together with a published photometric rotation period implies the
companion is viewed nearly pole-on, with a line-of-sight spin axis inclination
of $i_p$ = 14 $\pm$ 4 degrees or 166 $\pm$ 4 degrees. By contrast, the debris

constraints on their flux are scarce. Here we model how C-O-H outgassing could
have evolved through the late Hadean and early Archean, under the conditions
that global plate tectonics had not yet initiated, all outgassing was
subaerial, and graphite was the stable carbon phase in the melt source regions.
The model fully couples numerical mantle convection, partitioning of volatiles
into the melt, and chemical speciation in the gas phase. The mantle oxidation
state (which may not have reached late Archean values in the Hadean) is the
dominant control on individual species' outgassing rates because it affects
both the carbon content of basaltic magmas and the speciation of degassed
volatiles. Volcanic gas from mantles more reduced than the iron-w\""ustite
mineral redox buffer would contain virtually no CO2 because (i) carbonate ions
dissolve in magmas only in very limited amounts, and (ii) almost all degassed
carbon takes the form of CO instead of CO2. For oxidised mantles near the
quartz-fayalite-magnetite buffer, we predict median CO2 outgassing rates of
less than approximately 5 Tmol/yr, still lower than the outgassing rates used
in many Archean climate studies. Relatively weak outgassing is due in part to
the redox-limited CO2 contents of graphite-saturated melts, and also to a
stagnant lid regime's inefficient replenishment of upper mantle volatiles. Our
results point to certain chemical and geodynamic prerequisites for sustaining a
clement climate with a volcanic greenhouse under the Faint Young Sun.

softness, can be written as a product of infrared (IR) divergent loop-expanded
soft gluon currents and the matrix elements. In a more recent work,
Angeles-Martinez, Forshaw and Seymour \cite{Angeles-Martinez:2016dph} (AMFS)
showed that the result for this amplitude can in fact be re-expressed in an
ordered evolution approach, involving \textit{IR finite} one-loop insertions
where the virtual loop momentum is constrained in a highly non-trivial way by
the $k_T$ of the adjacent real emissions. The result thus exhibits a novel
amplitude level QCD coherence where the IR divergences originating only from
the very last, softest, gluon emission remain, and the rest cancel. The proof
of the AMFS result at one-loop in QCD, however, involves many diagrams, and
only after carefully grouping and summing over all the diagrams does the
correct ordering variable emerge, making the higher order extension a
challenging task. Moreover, the compact, Markovian nature of the final AMFS
result is suggestive of a deeper underlying physics that is obscured in the
derivation using traditional diagrammatic QCD. By considering a (recursive)
sequence of effective field theories (EFTs) with Glauber-SCET operators, we
present an elegant derivation of this result involving only a handful of
diagrams. The SCET derivation offers clean physical insights, and makes a
higher order extension of the AMFS result tractable. We also show that the
grouping of QCD graphs necessary to derive the AMFS result in full theory is
already implicit in the Feynman rules of Glauber-SCET operators such that the
same result can alternatively be derived with significantly less effort in a
single EFT with multiple ordered soft gluon emissions.

which has been limited to moderate cosmological distances for individual
galaxies due to the weakness of the hyperfine HI 21-cm transition. Here we
present a new approach that allows us to infer the HI gas mass $M_{\rm HI}$ of
individual galaxies up to $z\approx 6$, based on a direct measurement of the
[CII]-to-HI conversion factor in star-forming galaxies at $z\gtrsim 2$ using
$\gamma$-ray burst afterglows. By compiling recent [CII]-158 $\mu$m emission
line measurements we quantify the evolution of the HI content in galaxies
through cosmic time. We find that the HI mass starts to exceed the stellar mass
$M_\star$ at $z\gtrsim 1$, and increases as a function of redshift. The HI
fraction of the total baryonic mass increases from around $20\%$ at $z = 0$ to
about $60\%$ at $z\sim 6$. We further uncover a universal relation between the
HI gas fraction $M_{\rm HI}/M_\star$ and the gas-phase metallicity, which seems
to hold from $z\approx 6$ to $z=0$. The majority of galaxies at $z>2$ are
observed to have HI depletion times, $t_{\rm dep,HI} = M_{\rm HI}/{\rm SFR}$,
less than $\approx 2$ Gyr, substantially shorter than for $z\sim 0$ galaxies.
Finally, we use the [CII]-to-HI conversion factor to determine the cosmic mass
density of HI in galaxies, $\rho_{\rm HI}$, at three distinct epochs: $z\approx
0$, $z\approx 2$, and $z\sim 4-6$. These measurements are consistent with
previous estimates based on 21-cm HI observations in the local Universe and
with damped Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers (DLAs) at $z\gtrsim 2$, suggesting an
overall decrease by a factor of $\approx 5$ in $\rho_{\rm HI}(z)$ from the end
of the reionization epoch to the present.

Modularity, which measures the quality of a division of the vertices into

claim that this unequal treatment negatively impacts the performance of
clustering algorithms based on modularity for graphs with heavy-tailed degree

Monte Carlo approach-that does not suffer from teleportation effects, on the

(IMC) techniques for modeling radiative transfer have existed from the 1970s.
When they are used for optically thick problems, however, the basic algorithm
suffers from ""teleportation"" errors, where the photons propagate faster than
the exact physical behavior, due to the absorption-blackbody emission
processes. One possible solution is to use semianalog Monte Carlo, in its new
implicit form (ISMC), which uses two kinds of particles, photons and discrete
material particles. This algorithm yields excellent teleportation-free results,
but it also produces noisier solutions (relative to classic IMC), due to its
discrete nature. Here, we derive a new Monte Carlo algorithm, Discrete Implicit
Monte Carlo (DIMC), which also uses the idea of two kinds of discrete
particles, and thus does not suffer from teleportation errors. DIMC implements
the IMC discretization and creates new radiation photons for each time step,
unlike ISMC. Using the continuous absorption technique, DIMC yields smooth
results like classic IMC. One of the main elements of the algorithm is the
avoidance of the explosion of the particle population, by using particle
merging. We test the new algorithm on 1D and 2D cylindrical problems, and show
that it yields smooth, teleportation-free results. We finish by demonstrating
the power of the new algorithm on a classic radiative hydrodynamic problem-an
opaque radiative shock wave. This demonstrates the power of the new algorithm

Josephson effect at the twisted interface between $d$-wave superconductors. We
demonstrate that for clean interfaces with a twist angle $\theta_0$ in the
range $0^\circ<\theta_0<45^\circ$ the critical current can exhibit nonmonotonic
temperature dependence with a maximum at a nonzero temperature as well as a
complex dependence on the twist angle at low temperatures. The former is shown
to arise quite generically due to the contributions of the momenta around the
gap nodes, which are negative for nonzero twist angles. It is demonstrated that
these features reflect the geometry of the Fermi surface and are sensitive to
the form of the momentum dependence of the tunneling at the twisted interface.
Close to $\theta_0=45^\circ$ we find that the critical current does not vanish
due to Cooper pair cotunneling, which leads to a transition to a time-reversal
breaking topological superconducting $d+id$ phase. Weak interface roughness,
quasiperiodicity, and inhomogeneity broaden the momentum dependence of the
interlayer tunneling leading to a critical current $I_c\sim \cos(2\theta_0)$
with $\cos(6\theta_0)$ corrections. Furthermore, strong disorder at the
interface is demonstrated to suppress the time-reversal breaking
superconducting phase near $\theta_0=45^\circ$. Last, we provide a
comprehensive theoretical analysis of experiments that can reveal the full
current-phase relation for twisted superconductors close to
$\theta_0=45^\circ$. In particular, we demonstrate the emergence of the
Fraunhofer interference pattern near $\theta_0=45^\circ$, while accounting for
realistic sample geometries, and show that its temperature dependence can yield
unambiguous evidence of Cooper pair cotunneling, necessary for topological
superconductivity.

form topological phases with spontaneously broken time reversal symmetry ${\cal
T}$ for certain twist angles. With the goal of helping to identify unambiguous
signatures of these topological phases in transport experiments, we
theoretically investigate a suite of Josephson phenomena between twisted
layers. We find an unusual non-monotonic temperature dependence of the critical
current at intermediate twist angles which we attribute to the unconventional
sign structure of the $d$-wave order parameter. The onset of the ${\cal
T}$-broken phase near $45^\circ$ twist is marked by a crossover from the
conventional $2\pi$-periodic Josephson relation $J(\varphi)\simeq
J_c\sin{\varphi}$ to a $\pi$-periodic function as the single-pair tunneling
becomes dominated by a second order process that involves two Cooper pairs.
Despite this fundamental change, the critical current remains a smooth function
of the twist angle $\theta$ and temperature $T$ implying that a measurement of
$J_c$ alone will not be a litmus test for the ${\cal T}$-broken phase. To
obtain clear signatures of the ${\cal T}$-broken phase one must measure $J_c$
in the presence of an applied magnetic field or radio-frequency drive, where
the resulting Fraunhofer patterns and Shapiro steps are altered in a
characteristic manner. We discuss these results in light of recent experiments
on twisted bilayers of the high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductor

We first use density based DBSCAN clustering techniques, associating pulses

so-called mini-giant pulses, with $\sim10\times$ the average pulse amplitude.
We then perform an independent study, with Self-Organizing Maps (SOM)

the state sum to 4-manifolds with corners, making it an extended TQFT. We also

are often based on the tendency of electrons to localize even in large atomic
and molecular systems. However, in many cases of actual interest, for example
in semiconductor nanocrystals, system sizes can reach very large extension
before significant electron localization sets in and the scaling of the
numerical methods may deviate strongly from linear. Here, we address this class
of systems, by developing a massively parallel density functional theory (DFT)
approach which doesn't rely on electron localizationa and is formally quadratic
scaling, yet enables highly efficient linear wall-time complexity in the weak
scalability regime. The approach extends from the stochastic DFT method
described in Fabian et. al. WIRES: Comp. Mol. Science, e1412 2019 but is fully
deterministic. It uses standard quantum chemical atom-centered Gaussian basis
sets for representing the electronic wave functions combined with Cartesian
real space grids for some of the operators and for enabling a fast solver for
the Poisson equation. Our main conclusion is, that when a processor-abundant
high performance computing (HPC) infrastructure is available, this type of
approach has the potential to allow the study of large systems in regimes where
quantum confinement or electron delocalization prevents linear-scaling.

derive the dust temperature, $T_{\rm d}$, and mass, $M_{\rm d}$, of A1689-zD1
using both traditional modified blackbody spectral energy density fitting, and
a new method that relies only on the [CII] $158\ \mathrm{\mu m}$ line and

the accuracy of the dust temperature (mass) estimate by $\sim 50$% (6 times).
The derived temperatures confirm the reported increasing $T_{\rm d}$-redshift

prerequisite when constructing a detailed network model of the brain. The

reconstruction of crossing nerve fiber pathways in whole brain tissue samples
with micrometer resolution: The individual fiber orientations are determined by
illuminating unstained histological brain sections from different directions,
measuring the transmitted scattered light under normal incidence, and studying
the light intensity profiles of each pixel in the resulting image series. So
far, SLI measurements were performed with a fixed polar angle of illumination

the nerve fiber directions and limited information about the underlying tissue
structure. Here, we use an LED display with individually controllable
light-emitting diodes to measure the full distribution of scattered light
behind the sample (scattering pattern) for each image pixel at once, enabling
scatterometry measurements of whole brain tissue samples. We compare our
results to coherent Fourier scatterometry (raster-scanning the sample with a
non-focused laser beam) and previous SLI measurements with fixed polar angle of
illumination, using sections from a vervet monkey brain and human optic tracts.
Finally, we present SLI scatterometry measurements of a human brain section

ethograms. However, recent technological advances have led to a major
revolution in behavioral measurement. Specifically, digital video cameras and
automated pose tracking software can provide detailed measures of full body
position (i.e., pose) of multiple primates over time (i.e., behavior) with high
spatial and temporal resolution. Pose-tracking technology in turn can be used
to detect behavioral states, such as eating, sleeping, and mating. The
availability of such data has in turn spurred developments in data analysis
techniques. Together, these changes are poised to lead to major advances in
scientific fields that rely on behavioral as a dependent variable. In this

by the generalized Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equation, a Riccati
equation in the radial pressure. For a perfect fluid source, it is known that
finding a new solution from an existing solution requires solving a Bernoulli
equation, if the density profile is kept the same. In this paper, we consider
maps between static (an)isotropic fluid spheres with the same (arbitrary)
density profile and present solution-generating techniques to find new
solutions from existing ones. The maps, in general, require solving an
associated Riccati equation, which, unlike the Bernoulli equation, cannot be
solved by quadrature. In any case, it can be shown that the output solution is
not, in general, regular for a given regular input solution. However, if
pressure anisotropy is kept the same, the new solution is both regular and can
be found by solving a Bernoulli equation. We give a few examples where the
generalized TOV equation, under algebraic constraints, can be converted into a
Bernoulli equation and thus, solved exactly. We discuss the physical
significance of these Bernoulli equations. Since the density profile remains
the same in our approach, the spatial line element is identical for all
solutions, which facilitates direct comparison between various equilibrium
configurations using fluid variables as functions of the radial coordinate.
Finally, combining with the previous study on generation algorithms, we show
how this study leads us to a new three-parameter family of exact solutions that

that can be tuned by varying the temperature and pressure. As-synthesized
CuInP$_2$S$_6$ is a layered material that displays ferrielectric behavior at
room temperature. When synthesized with Cu deficiencies, CuInP$_2$S$_6$
spontaneously phase segregates to form ferrielectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$ (CIPS) and
paraelectric In$_{4/3}$P$_2$S$_6$ (IPS) domains in a two-dimensional
self-assembled heterostructure. Here, we study the effect of hydrostatic
pressure on the structure of Cu-deficient CuInP$_2$S$_6$ by Raman spectroscopy
measurements up to 20 GPa. Detailed analysis of the frequencies, intensities,
and linewidths of the Raman peaks reveals four discontinuities in the spectra
around 2, 10, 13 and 17 GPa. At ~2 GPa, we observe a structural transition
initiated by the diffusion of IPS domains, which culminates in a drastic
reduction of the number of peaks around 10 GPa. We attribute this to a possible
monoclinic-trigonal phase transition at 10 GPa. At higher pressures (~ 13 GPa),
significant increases in peak intensities and sharpening of the Raman peaks
suggest a bandgap-lowering and an isostructural electronic transition, with a
possible onset of metallization at pressures above 17 GPa. When the pressure is
released, the structure again phase-separates into two distinct chemical
domains within the same single crystalline framework -- however, these domains
are much smaller in size than the as-synthesized material resulting in
suppression of ferroelectricity through nanoconfinement. Hydrostatic pressure
can thus be used to tune the electronic and ferrielectric properties of
Cu-deficient layered CuInP$_2$S$_6$.

galaxy clusters (CFP) using ~250 simulated clusters from The Three Hundred
project, focusing on the stability of the plane against different temperature
definitions and its dependence on the dynamical relaxation state of clusters.
The CFP is characterised by $T\propto M_\mathrm{s}^\alpha\,r_\mathrm{s}^\beta$,
defined with the gas temperature ($T$) and the characteristic halo scale radius
and mass ($r_\mathrm{s}$ and $M_\mathrm{s}$) assuming a Navarro-Frenk-White
halo description. We explore two definitions of weighted temperatures, namely
mass-weighted and spectroscopic-like temperatures, in three radial ranges. The
Three Hundred project clusters at $z=0$ lie on a thin plane whose parameters
($\alpha,\beta$) and dispersion ($0.015-0.030$ dex) depend on the gas
temperature definition. The CFP for mass-weighted temperatures is closer to the
virial equilibrium expectation ($\alpha=1,\beta=-1$) with a smaller dispersion.
For gas temperatures measured within $500h^{-1}$ kpc, the resulting CFP
deviates the most from the virial expectation and shifts towards the similarity
solution for a secondary infall model ($\alpha=1.5,\beta=-2$). Independently of
the temperature definition, we find that clusters at $z=1$ and relaxed clusters
form a CFP similar to the virial expectation, unlike disturbed clusters
exhibiting stronger evolution. Only systems formed over the last 4 Gyr present
a CFP that is closer to the similarity solution. All these findings are
compatible with the CFP obtained for a CLASH subsample excluding the hottest
clusters with $T_\mathrm{X}>12$ keV.

problem in neural synthesis with immediate applications in architectural CAD,
computer graphics, as well as in generating virtual robot training
environments. This task is challenging because 3D scenes exhibit diverse
patterns, ranging from continuous ones, such as object sizes and the relative
poses between pairs of shapes, to discrete patterns, such as occurrence and
co-occurrence of objects with symmetrical relationships. This paper introduces
a novel neural scene synthesis approach that can capture diverse feature
patterns of 3D scenes. Our method combines the strength of both neural
network-based and conventional scene synthesis approaches. We use the
parametric prior distributions learned from training data, which provide
uncertainties of object attributes and relative attributes, to regularize the
outputs of feed-forward neural models. Moreover, instead of merely predicting a
scene layout, our approach predicts an over-complete set of attributes. This
methodology allows us to utilize the underlying consistency constraints among
the predicted attributes to prune infeasible predictions. Experimental results
show that our approach outperforms existing methods considerably. The generated
3D scenes interpolate the training data faithfully while preserving both
continuous and discrete feature patterns.

today, many aspects of the underlying consensus protocols are poorly
understood. Therefore, the search for protocols that improve either throughput
or security (or both) continues. Bitcoin always selects the longest chain
(i.e., the one with most work). Forks may occur when two miners extend the same
block simultaneously, and the frequency of forks depends on how fast blocks are
propagated in the network. In the GHOST protocol, used by Ethereum, all blocks
involved in the fork contribute to the security. However, the greedy chain
selection rule of GHOST does not consider the full information available in the
block tree, which has led to some concerns about its security.
  This paper introduces a new family of protocols, called Medium, which takes
the structure of the whole block tree into account, by weighting blocks
differently according to their depths. Bitcoin and GHOST result as special
cases. This protocol leads to new insights about the security of Bitcoin and
GHOST and paves the way for developing network- and application-specific
protocols, in which the influence of forks on the chain-selection process can
be controlled. It is shown that almost all protocols in this family achieve
strictly greater throughput than Bitcoin (at the same security level) and
resist attacks that can be mounted against GHOST.

site of continuous magnetic reconnection. Using grid-adaptive,
non-relativistic, resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, we establish
that slow, near-steady Sweet-Parker reconnection transits to a chaotic,
multi-plasmoid fragmented state, when the Lundquist number exceeds about ten to
the fourth power, well in the range of previous studies on plasmoid
instability. The extreme resolution employed in the MHD study shows significant
magnetic island substructures. With relativistic test-particle simulations, we
explore how charged particles can be accelerated in the vicinity of an O-point,
either at embedded tiny-islands within larger ""monster""-islands or near the
centers of monster-islands. While the planar MHD setting artificially causes
strong acceleration in the ignored third direction, it also allows for the full
analytic study of all aspects leading to the acceleration and the
in-plane-projected trapping of particles in the vicinities of O-points. Our
analytic approach uses a decomposition of the particle velocity in slow- and
fast-changing components, akin to the Reynolds decomposition in turbulence
studies. Our analytic description is validated with several representative
test-particle simulations. We find that after an initial non-relativistic
motion throughout a monster island, particles can experience acceleration in
the vicinity of an O-point beyond 0.7c, at which speed the acceleration is at

arbitraging the hourly price spreads in the day-ahead auction. The optimal
approach to this is challenging if risk is a consideration as this requires the
estimation of density functions. Since the hourly prices are not normal and not
independent, creating spread densities from the difference of separately
estimated price densities is generally intractable. Thus, forecasts of all
intraday hourly spreads were directly specified as an upper triangular matrix
containing densities. The model was a flexible four-parameter distribution used
to produce dynamic parameter estimates conditional upon exogenous factors, most
importantly wind, solar and the day-ahead demand forecasts. These forecasts
supported the optimal daily scheduling of a storage facility, operating on
single and multiple cycles per day. The optimization is innovative in its use
of spread trades rather than hourly prices, which this paper argues, is more
attractive in reducing risk. In contrast to the conventional approach of
trading the daily peak and trough, multiple trades are found to be profitable
and opportunistic depending upon the weather forecasts.

functionality as a response to changing operational conditions, which makes
them more versatile than their static counterparts. However, most active
structures currently lack the capability to achieve multiple, different target
states with a single input actuation or require a tedious material programming
step. Furthermore, the systematic design and fabrication of active structures
is still a challenge as many structures are designed by hand in a trial and
error process and thus are limited by engineers' knowledge and experience. In
this work, a computational design and fabrication framework is proposed to
generate structures with multiple target states for one input actuation that
don't require a separate training step. A material dithering scheme based on
multi-material 3D printing is combined with locally applied copper coil heating
elements and sequential heating patterns to control the thermo-mechanical
properties of the structures and switch between the different deformation
modes. A novel topology optimization approach based on power diagrams is used
to encode the different target states in the structure while ensuring the
fabricability of the structures and the compatibility with the drop-in heating
elements. The versatility of the proposed framework is demonstrated for four
different example structures from engineering and computer graphics. The
numerical and experimental results show that the optimization framework can
produce structures that show the desired motion, but experimental accuracy is
limited by current fabrication methods. The generality of the proposed method
makes it suitable for the development of structures for applications in many
different fields from aerospace to robotics to animated fabrication in computer

exploit either (i) implicit document information (e.g., latent relations among
entity mentions, or general language models) or (ii) connections between the
candidate links (e.g, as inferred from the external knowledge base).
Specifically, we cluster mentions that are linked via coreference, and enforce
a single EL for all of the clustered mentions together. The latter constraint
has the added benefit of increased coverage by joining EL candidate lists for
the thus clustered mentions. We formulate the coref+EL problem as a structured
prediction task over directed trees and use a globally normalized model to
solve it. Experimental results on two datasets show a boost of up to +5%
F1-score on both coref and EL tasks, compared to their standalone counterparts.
For a subset of hard cases, with individual mentions lacking the correct EL in
their candidate entity list, we obtain a +50% increase in accuracy.

interrogated Nb thin films and transmon qubit structures fabricated by Rigetti

events of neutron star-black hole mergers. An interesting property of this
merger is that the black hole, if spinning rapidly, has its spin axis
negatively aligned (with a misalignment angle $> 90^{\circ}$) with the binary
orbital angular momentum vector. Although such a large spin-orbit misalignment
angle naturally points toward a dynamical origin, the measured neutron
star-black hole merger rate exceeds theoretical predictions of the dynamical
formation channel. In the canonical isolated binary formation scenario, the
immediate progenitor of GW200115 is likely to be a binary consisting of a black
hole and a helium star, with the latter forming a neutron star during a
supernova explosion. Since the black hole is generally expected to spin along
the pre-supernova binary orbital angular momentum axis, a large neutron star
natal kick is required to produce the observed misalignment angle. Using simple
kinematic arguments, we find that a misalignment angle $> 90^{\circ}$ in
GW200115-like systems implies a kick velocity $\sim 600\, \text{km/s}$ and a
kick direction within $\approx 30 ^{\circ}$ of the pre-supernova orbital plane.

interacting simultaneously with an array of other skyrmions and quenched
disorder. For drives just above depinning, we observe a broad band noise signal
with a $1/f$ characteristic, while at higher drives, narrow band or white noise
appears. Even in the absence of quenched disorder, the threshold force that
must be applied to translate the driven skyrmion is finite due to elastic
interactions with other skyrmions. The depinning threshold increases as the
strength of the quenched disorder is raised. Above the depinning force, the
skyrmion moves faster in the presence of quenched disorder than in a
disorder-free system since the pinning sites prevent other skyrmions from being
dragged along with the driven skyrmion. For strong pinning, we find a
stick-slip motion of the driven skyrmion which produces a telegraph noise
signature. The depinning threshold increases monotonically with skyrmion
density in the absence of quenched disorder, but when pinning is present, the
depinning threshold changes nonmonotonically with skyrmion density and there
are reentrant pinned phases due to a competition between pinning induced by the
quenched disorder and that produced by the elastic interactions of the skyrmion
lattice.

some examples of why quantum properties are problematic: they depend on the

to the indistinguishability of elementary particles. We argue that one could be
in trouble in applying the classical theory of identity to the quantum domain
if we take indiscernibility as a core and fundamental concept. Thus, in
considering indistinguishability as such a fundamental notion, it implies, if
taken earnestly, that one should not apply standard logic to quantum objects.
Consequently, we end with a discussion about novel aspects this new mathematics
brings and how it relates to some issues associated with the quantum world's
ontology and the classical limit. We emphasize that, despite several different
ways of questioning classical logic in the quantum domain, our approach is
distinct. It involves one of the core concepts of classical logic, namely,
identity. So, we are in a different paradigm from standard quantum logics.

both to vary over time (time-dependent). This tutorial illustrates adding two
types of time-dependency using a previously published cost-effectiveness
analysis of multiple strategies as an example. The first is simulation-time
dependence, which allows for the transition probabilities to vary as a function
of time as measured since the start of the simulation (e.g., varying
probability of death as the cohort ages). The second is state-residence time
dependence, allowing for history by tracking the time spent in any particular
health state using tunnel states. We use these time-dependent cSTMs to conduct
cost-effectiveness and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. We also obtain
various epidemiological outcomes of interest from the outputs generated from
the cSTM, such as survival probability and disease prevalence, often used for
model calibration and validation. We present the mathematical notation first,

Our aim was to find out whether the availability of architectural views
produced by RELAX can help maintainers who are new to a project in becoming
productive with development tasks sooner, and find out how they felt about
working in such an environment. Method. We conducted a user study with nine
participants. They were subjected to a controlled experiment in which
maintenance success and speed with and without access to RELAX recovery results
were compared to each other. Results. We have observed that employing
architecture views produced by RELAX helped participants reduce time to get
started on maintenance tasks by a factor of 5.38 or more. While most
participants were unable to finish their tasks within the allotted time when
they did not have recovery results available, all of them finished them
successfully when they did. Additionally, participants reported that these
views were easy to understand, helped them to learn the system's structure and
enabled them to compare different versions of the system. Conclusions. In the
speedup experienced to the start of maintenance experienced by the participants
as well as in their experience-based opinions, RELAX has shown itself to be a
valuable help that could form the basis for further tools that specifically

recursively aggregating information from its neighbors, have become a
predominant computational tool in many domains. To handle large-scale graphs,
most of the existing methods partition the input graph into multiple sub-graphs
(e.g., through node clustering) and apply batch training to save memory cost.
However, such batch training will lead to label bias within each batch, and
then result in over-confidence in model predictions. Since the connected nodes
with positively related labels tend to be assigned together, the traditional
cross-entropy minimization process will attend on the predictions of biased
classes in the batch, and may intensify the overfitting issue. To overcome the
label bias problem, we propose the adaptive label smoothing (ALS) method to
replace the one-hot hard labels with smoothed ones, which learns to allocate
label confidences from the biased classes to the others. Specifically, ALS
propagates node labels to aggregate the neighborhood label distribution in a
pre-processing step, and then updates the optimal smoothed labels online to
adapt to specific graph structure. Experiments on the real-world datasets
demonstrate that ALS can be generally applied to the main scalable learning
frameworks to calibrate the biased labels and improve generalization
performances.

contentious content and structure can be a predictor for this task, however,
most of them have been focused on conversation in general, very specific

fills these gaps by focusing on conversations from highly divisive topics
(abortion, climate change, and gun control), operationalizing a set of novel
linguistic and conversational characteristics and user factors, and
incorporating them to build interpretable models. We demonstrate that such
characteristics can largely improve the performance of prediction on this task,

contentious topics suggest that certain generic linguistic characteristics are
highly correlated with contentiousness in conversations while others
demonstrate significant contextual influences on specific divisive topics.

track of the idle time each station spends during backoff. To correctly
estimate each backoff value, we present a cross-correlation-based technique
that uses the frequency offset between the AP and each station to identify
stations involved in uplink collisions. The AP constructs empirical
distributions for the monitored backoff values and compares them with a set of
nominal PMF's, created via Markov analysis of the DCF protocol to estimate
CWmin of various stations. After detecting the aggressive stations, the AP can
choose to stop serving those stations. Simulation results show that the

to adversarial examples to devastate the perturbation previously added to
normal examples. Experimental results show that the method performs well. For
the devastation of examples, the original speech similarity after adding noise

However, many phenomena are non-Gaussian, and these estimators can therefore
have poor efficiency. This paper proposes a new tunable S-estimator, termed the
S-q estimator, for the general class of symmetric elliptical distributions, a
class containing many common families such as the multivariate Gaussian, t-,
Cauchy, Laplace, hyperbolic, and normal inverse Gaussian distributions. Across
this class, the S-q estimator is shown to generally provide higher maximum
efficiency than other leading high-breakdown estimators while maintaining the
maximum breakdown point. Furthermore, its robustness is demonstrated to be on

broadly applicable for practitioners. This is demonstrated with an example

structure was centered at 6.6 keV and significantly broadened with a large
equivalent width of 4.3 keV, corresponding to a line photon flux of 4.7
$\times$ 10$^{-3}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The 3-20 keV spectrum was reproduced
successfully by a power law continuum with narrow and broad (2.7 keV in FWHM)
Gaussian emission components. Alternatively, the feature can be described by
four narrow Gaussians, centered at 5.5 keV, 6.5 keV, 7.5 keV and 8.6 keV.
Considering the strength and shape of the feature, it is unlikely to have
originated from reflection of the continuum X-rays by some optically thick
materials, such as an accretion disk. Moreover, the intensity of the emission
structure decreased significantly with an exponential time scale of 1 hr. The
feature was not detected in an INTEGRAL observation performed 10 h before the

gravitationally redshifted charge exchange emission from Ti, Cr, Fe, and Co. We
suggest that the emission results from a charge exchange interaction between a

be problematic due to the difficulty in implementing complex modeling
approaches, low precision of estimates, and absence of rigor in testing of
model assumptions and their influence on results. Here, we describe a novel
approach that uses still image camera traps to estimate animal density without
the need for individual identification, based on the Time spent In Front of the
Camera (TIFC). Using results from a large-scale multi-species monitoring
program with nearly 3,000 cameras deployed over six years in Alberta, Canada,
we provide a reproducible methodology to estimate parameters and we test key
assumptions of the TIFC model. We compare moose (Alces alces) density estimates
from aerial surveys and TIFC, including incorporating correction factors for
known TIFC assumption violations. The resulting corrected TIFC density
estimates are comparable to aerial density estimates. We discuss the
limitations of the TIFC method and areas needing further investigation,
including the need for long-term monitoring of assumption violations and the
number of cameras necessary to provide precise estimates. Despite the
challenges of assumption violations and high measurement error, cameras and the
TIFC method can provide useful alternative or complementary animal density
estimates for multi-species monitoring when compared to traditional monitoring
methods.

significant role in the generation of prominent shallow angle noise radiation
of jets. Economical prediction tools often model these wavepackets in the
frequency-domain using stability modes of the mean flow. The use of simplifying
choices, such as parabolized equations and azimuthal decomposition, provide
efficient methods but can impose constraints on rate of streamwise variation of
the mean state or geometric complexity. The current investigation develops a
time-domain linearized Navier-Stokes-based approach predicated on the mean
basic state for two goals: i) to obtain the radiated shallow-angle noise field,
including that from imperfectly expanded jets containing shock trains, and ii)
to estimate noise control trends with actuator frequency. A previously
developed implicit linearization technique repurposing native non-linear
Navier-Stokes code capabilities avoids any additional constraints on nozzle
geometry, while its time-domain nature facilitates control analysis through
transient pulse response. Two other integral components of the method are the
sifting of linearized perturbations to isolate the acoustic component with
Doak's Momentum Potential Theory, and subsequently Dynamic Mode Decomposition
to analyze the response in different spectral ranges. Comparisons with
well-validated LES databases show accurate model predictions for
super-radiative shallow angle noise, including for hot jets from military-style
nozzles. For a specific jet with extensive published experimental data using
plasma actuators, it is shown that the method correctly predicts noise
amplification at lower frequencies and reduction at higher values, at the
observed crossover location. Considerations on the costs associated with the
approach, which exploits linearity to extract multiple frequencies with each
simulation, are outlined.

behaviors of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). First, we evaluated the size
of the receptive field. Previous studies have attempted to increase or control
the size of the receptive field. However, we observed that the size of the
receptive field does not describe the classification accuracy. The size of the
receptive field would be inappropriate for representing superiority in
performance because it reflects only depth or kernel size and does not reflect
other factors such as width or cardinality. Second, using the effective
receptive field, we examined the pixels contributing to the output.
Intuitively, each pixel is expected to equally contribute to the final output.
However, we found that there exist pixels in a partially dead state with little
contribution to the output. We reveal that the reason for this lies in the
architecture of CNN and discuss solutions to reduce the phenomenon.
Interestingly, for general classification tasks, the existence of dead pixels
improves the training of CNNs. However, in a task that captures small
perturbation, dead pixels degrade the performance. Therefore, the existence of
these dead pixels should be understood and considered in practical applications
of CNN.

limiting its application in real-time TBI risk monitoring. To accelerate,
machine learning head models (MLHMs) were developed, and the model accuracy was
found to decrease when the training/test datasets were from different head
impacts types. However, the size of dataset for specific impact types may not
be enough for model training. To address the computational cost of FEM, the
limited strain rate prediction, and the generalizability of MLHMs to on-field
datasets, we propose data fusion and transfer learning to develop a series of
MLHMs to predict the maximum principal strain (MPS) and maximum principal
strain rate (MPSR). We trained and tested the MLHMs on 13,623 head impacts from
simulations, American football, mixed martial arts, car crash, and compared
against the models trained on only simulations or only on-field impacts. The
MLHMs developed with transfer learning are significantly more accurate in
estimating MPS and MPSR than other models, with a mean absolute error (MAE)
smaller than 0.03 in predicting MPS and smaller than 7 (1/s) in predicting MPSR
on all impact datasets. The MLHMs can be applied to various head impact types
for rapidly and accurately calculating brain strain and strain rate. Besides
the clinical applications in real-time brain strain and strain rate monitoring,
this model helps researchers estimate the brain strain and strain rate caused

with high probability, well-spread with respect to the $\ell_2$-norm. Namely,
every nonzero $x \in X$ is ""robustly non-sparse"" in the following sense: $x$ is
$\varepsilon \|x\|_2$-far in $\ell_2$-distance from all $\delta n$-sparse
vectors, for positive constants $\varepsilon, \delta$ bounded away from $0$.
This ""$\ell_2$-spread"" property is the natural counterpart, for subspaces over
the reals, of the minimum distance of linear codes over finite fields, and
corresponds to $X$ being a Euclidean section of the $\ell_1$ unit ball.
Explicit $\ell_2$-spread subspaces of dimension $\Omega(n)$, however, are
unknown, and the best known constructions (which achieve weaker spread
properties), are analogs of low density parity check (LDPC) codes over the
reals, i.e., they are kernels of sparse matrices.
  We study the spread properties of the kernels of sparse random matrices.
Rather surprisingly, we prove that with high probability such subspaces contain
vectors $x$ that are $o(1)\cdot \|x\|_2$-close to $o(n)$-sparse with respect to
the $\ell_2$-norm, and in particular are not $\ell_2$-spread.
  On the other hand, for $p < 2$ we prove that such subspaces are
$\ell_p$-spread with high probability. Moreover, we show that a random sparse
matrix has the stronger restricted isometry property (RIP) with respect to the
$\ell_p$ norm, and this follows solely from the unique expansion of a random
biregular graph, yielding a somewhat unexpected generalization of a similar
result for the $\ell_1$ norm [BGI+08]. Instantiating this with explicit

be factorized with collinear parton distributions and fragmentation functions.
We study the factorization up to twist-3 level and obtain gauge invariant

hyperspectral face images come at the cost of limited amount of photons reached
a narrow spectral window on average, which greatly reduces the spatial
resolution of hyperspectral face images. In this paper, we investigate how to
adapt the deep learning techniques to hyperspectral face image super-resolution
(HFSR), especially when the training samples are very limited. Benefiting from
the amount of spectral bands, in which each band can be seen as an image, we
present a spectral splitting and aggregation network (SSANet) for HFSR with
limited training samples. In the shallow layers, we split the hyperspectral
image into different spectral groups. Then, we gradually aggregate the neighbor
bands at deeper layers to exploit spectral correlations. By this spectral
splitting and aggregation strategy (SSAS), we can divide the original
hyperspectral image into multiple samples (\emph{from less to more}) to support
the efficient training of the network and effectively exploit the spectral
correlations among spectrum. To cope with the challenge of small training
sample size (S3) problem, we propose to expand the training samples by a
self-representation model and symmetry-induced augmentation. Experiments show
that SSANet can well model the joint correlations of spatial and spectral
information. By expanding the training samples, SSANet can effectively
alleviate the S3 problem.

radiobiological model was developed to estimate clonogen survival fraction
(SF), using 18F-fluoroazomycin arabinoside PET (FAZA PET) images from ten
patients with pancreatic cancer to quantify oxygen enhancement effects. For
each patient, four simulated five-fraction stereotactic body radiotherapy
(SBRT) plans were generated: 1) a standard SBRT plan aiming to cover the
planning target volume with 40 Gy, 2) dose painting plans delivering escalated
doses to FAZA-avid hypoxic sub-volumes, 3) dose painting plans with simulated
spacer separating the duodenum and pancreatic head, and 4), plans with
integrated boosts to geometric contractions of the tumour (GTV). All plans
saturated at least one OAR dose limit. SF was calculated for each plan and
sensitivity of SF to simulated hypoxia quantification errors was evaluated.
Dose painting resulted in a 55% reduction in SF as compared to standard SBRT;
78% with spacer. Integrated boosts to hypoxia-blind geometric contractions
resulted in a 41% reduction in SF. The reduction in SF for dose-painting plans
persisted for all hypoxia quantification parameters studied, including
registration and rigid motion errors that resulted in shifts and rotations of
the GTV and hypoxic sub-volumes by as much as 1 cm and 10 degrees. Although
proximity to OARs ultimately limited dose escalation, with estimated SFs
(~10^-5) well above levels required to completely ablate a ~10 cm^3 tumour,
dose painting robustly reduced clonogen survival when accounting for expected
treatment and imaging uncertainties and thus, may improve local response and
associated morbidity.

(CNNs) take a fair amount of computation cost. Meanwhile, existing research
reveals the salient parameter redundancy in CNNs. The current pruning methods
can compress CNNs with little performance drop, but when the pruning ratio
increases, the accuracy loss is more serious. Moreover, some iterative pruning
methods are difficult to accurately identify and delete unimportant parameters
due to the accuracy drop during pruning. We propose a novel adversarial
iterative pruning method (AIP) for CNNs based on knowledge transfer. The
original network is regarded as the teacher while the compressed network is the
student. We apply attention maps and output features to transfer information
from the teacher to the student. Then, a shallow fully-connected network is
designed as the discriminator to allow the output of two networks to play an
adversarial game, thereby it can quickly recover the pruned accuracy among
pruning intervals. Finally, an iterative pruning scheme based on the importance
of channels is proposed. We conduct extensive experiments on the image
classification tasks CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ILSVRC-2012 to verify our pruning
method can achieve efficient compression for CNNs even without accuracy loss.
On the ILSVRC-2012, when removing 36.78% parameters and 45.55% floating-point
operations (FLOPs) of ResNet-18, the Top-1 accuracy drop are only 0.66%. Our
method is superior to some state-of-the-art pruning schemes in terms of

address the cold-start recommendation (CSR) problem for recommender systems. In
MAIL, one unique tower is constructed to tackle the CSR from a zero-shot view,
and the other tower focuses on the general ranking task. Specifically, the
zero-shot tower first performs cross-modal reconstruction with dual
auto-encoders to obtain virtual behavior data from highly aligned hidden
features for new users; and the ranking tower can then output recommendations
for users based on the completed data by the zero-shot tower. Practically, the
ranking tower in MAIL is model-agnostic and can be implemented with any
embedding-based deep models. Based on the co-training of the two towers, the
MAIL presents an end-to-end method for recommender systems that shows an
incremental performance improvement. The proposed method has been successfully
deployed on the live recommendation system of NetEase Cloud Music to achieve a
click-through rate improvement of 13% to 15% for millions of users. Offline

background to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Such excess can be
produced by the decay of unstable particles into small mass dark photons which
have a non-zero mixing angle with electromagnetism. We use the EDGES-LOW band
measurements to derive joint constraints on the properties of the early
galaxies and the parameters of such a particle physics model for the excess
radio background. A Bayesian analysis shows that a high star formation
efficiency and X-ray emission of $4-7 \times 10^{48} ~\rm erg$ per solar mass
in stars are required along with a suppression of star formation in halos with
virial temperatures $\lesssim 2\times 10^4$ K. The same analysis also suggests
a 68 percent credible intervals for the mass of the decaying dark matter

systems, where occlusions stand as one of the biggest challenges. If the target
is occluded from the sensor, detecting and grasping such objects become very
challenging. For example, when multiple robot arms cooperate in a single
workplace, occlusions will be created under the robot arm itself and hide
objects underneath. While occlusions can be greatly reduced by installing
multiple sensors, the increase in sensor costs cannot be ignored. Moreover, the
sensor placements must be rearranged every time the robot operation routine and
layout change.
  To diminish occlusions, we propose the first robot vision system with
tilt-type mirror reflection sensing. By instantly tilting the sensor itself, we
obtain two sensing results with different views: conventional direct
line-of-sight sensing and non-line-of-sight sensing via mirror reflections. Our
proposed system removes occlusions adaptively by detecting the occlusions in
the scene and dynamically configuring the sensor tilt angle to sense the
detected occluded area. Thus, sensor rearrangements are not required even after
changes in robot operation or layout. Since the required hardware is the
tilt-unit and a commercially available mirror, the cost increase is marginal.
Through experiments, we show that our system can achieve a similar detection
accuracy as systems with multiple sensors, regardless of the single-sensor
implementation.

against adversarial attacks in machine learning. Variants of this method have
been used as regularization mechanisms to achieve SOTA results on NLP
benchmarks, and they have been found to be useful for transfer learning and
continual learning. We search for the reasons for the effectiveness of AT by
contrasting vanilla and adversarially fine-tuned BERT models. We identify
partial preservation of BERT's syntactic abilities during fine-tuning as the
key to the success of AT. We observe that adversarially fine-tuned models
remain more faithful to BERT's language modeling behavior and are more
sensitive to the word order. As concrete examples of syntactic abilities, an
adversarially fine-tuned model could have an advantage of up to 38% on anaphora
agreement and up to 11% on dependency parsing. Our analysis demonstrates that
vanilla fine-tuning oversimplifies the sentence representation by focusing
heavily on a small subset of words. AT, however, moderates the effect of these
influential words and encourages representational diversity. This allows for a
more hierarchical representation of a sentence and leads to the mitigation of
BERT's loss of syntactic abilities.

powered communication network (WPCN), where devices first harvest energy from a

non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to a data sink in the uplink (UL).
However, most existing works on WPCNs adopted the simplified linear
energy-harvesting model and also cannot guarantee strict user
quality-of-service requirements. To address these issues, we aim to minimize
the total transmit energy consumption at the PS by jointly optimizing the
resource allocation and IRS phase shifts over time, subject to the minimum
throughput requirements of all devices. The formulated problem is decomposed
into two subproblems, and solved iteratively in an alternative manner by
employing difference of convex functions programming, successive convex
approximation, and penalty-based algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate the
significant performance gains achieved by the proposed algorithm over benchmark
schemes and reveal the benefits of integrating IRS into WPCNs. In particular,
employing different IRS phase shifts over UL and DL outperforms the case with
static IRS beamforming.

abundances, and Galactic structures and kinematics. Accurate estimation of the
RC parameters -- absolute magnitude and intrinsic color -- is the basis for
obtaining high-precision RC distances. By combining astrometric data from Gaia,
spectroscopic data from APOGEE and LAMOST, and multi-band photometric data from
Gaia, APASS, Pan-STARRS1, 2MASS, and WISE surveys, we use the Gaussian process
regression to train machine learners to derive the multi-band absolute
magnitudes $M_\lambda$ and intrinsic colors $(\lambda_1-\lambda_2)_0$ for each
spectral RC. The dependence of $M_\lambda$ on metallicity decreases from
optical to infrared bands, while the dependence of $M_\lambda$ on age is
relatively similar in each band. $(\lambda_1-\lambda_2)_0$ are more affected by
metallicity than age. The RC parameters are not suitable to be represented by
simple constants but are related to the Galactic stellar population structure.
By analyzing the variation of $M_\lambda$ and $(\lambda_1-\lambda_2)_0$ in the
spatial distribution, we construct $(R, z)$ dependent maps of mean absolute
magnitudes and mean intrinsic colors of the Galactic RCs. Through external and
internal validation, we find that using three-dimensional (3D) parameter maps
to determine RC parameters avoids systematic bias and reduces dispersion by
about 20% compared to using constant parameters. Based on Gaia's EDR3 parallax,
our 3D parameter maps, and extinction-distance profile selection, we obtain a
photometric RC sample containing 11 million stars with distance and extinction
measurements.

observe the LD and HD phases, and the maximal-current phase disappears.
Further, we also measure the dynamics for a single dynein particle which is
logarithmically slower than a TASEP particle with a shorter waiting time. Our
results also confirm experimental observations of the dwell time distribution.
The dwell time distribution for dyneins is exponential in less crowded

Based on period analysis, there is a short-term variation superimposed on the
long-term period decrease. The trend of period change can be fitted with a
downward parabolic curve indicating a period decrease at a rate of
$\mathrm{d}P/\mathrm{d}t = -3.36(\pm 0.02)\times10^{-8}$ d $\textrm{yr}^{-1}$.
This long-term period decrease can be explained by mass transfer from the more
massive component ($M_2 \sim 0.79 M_{\odot}$) to the less massive one ($M_1
\sim 0.39 M_{\odot}$), combination with AML. For photometric study, we found
that the binary consists of K0\,V stars and at the middle shallow contact phase
with evolution of fill-out factor from 8.8\,\% (in 2007) to 23.2\,\% (in 2020).
Those results suggest that the binary is at pre-transition stage of evolution
from W-type to A-type, agreeing to the results of statistical study of W-type
contact binaries. The mass of $M_2$ will be decreased close to or below $M_1$
and the mass ratio will be decreased ($q < 1.0$). By this way, the binary will
evolve into A-type as a deeper normal over-contact system with period increase.

the mass ratio meet the critical value ($q < 0.094$), as well as produce a red

mixed boundary value conditions and a membrane surface charge density to
reflect the effects of ion sizes and membrane charges on electrostatics and
ionic concentrations. To overcome the difficulties of strong singularities and
exponential nonlinearities, it is split into three submodels with a solution of
Model 1 collecting all the singular points and Models 2 and 3 much easier to
solve numerically than the original nuSMPBIC model. A damped two-block
iterative method is then presented to solve Model 3, along with a novel
modified Newton iterative scheme for solving each related nonlinear algebraic
system. To this end, an effective nuSMPBIC finite element solver is derived and
then implemented as a program package that works for an ion channel protein
with a three-dimensional molecular structure and a mixture solution of multiple
ionic species. Numerical results for a voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC)
in a mixture of four ionic species demonstrate a fast convergence rate of the
damped two-block iterative method, the high performance of the software
package, and the importance of considering nonuniform ion sizes. Moreover, the
nuSMPBIC model is validated by the anion selectivity property of VDAC.

boosted trees) are the leading machine learning methods for structured and
tabular data, respectively. Many papers have empirically compared large numbers
of classifiers on one or two different domains (e.g., on 100 different tabular
data settings). However, a careful conceptual and empirical comparison of these
two strategies using the most contemporary best practices has yet to be
performed. Conceptually, we illustrate that both can be profitably viewed as
""partition and vote"" schemes. Specifically, the representation space that they
both learn is a partitioning of feature space into a union of convex polytopes.
For inference, each decides on the basis of votes from the activated nodes.
This formulation allows for a unified basic understanding of the relationship
between these methods. Empirically, we compare these two strategies on hundreds
of tabular data settings, as well as several vision and auditory settings. Our
focus is on datasets with at most 10,000 samples, which represent a large
fraction of scientific and biomedical datasets. In general, we found forests to
excel at tabular and structured data (vision and audition) with small sample
sizes, whereas deep nets performed better on structured data with larger sample
sizes. This suggests that further gains in both scenarios may be realized via
further combining aspects of forests and networks. We will continue revising
this technical report in the coming months with updated results.

wherein high-dimensional slices of a free energy surface are independently
sampled and combined. The method enables one to accomplish a controlled
exploration of the CV-space with a restraining bias as in umbrella sampling
(US), and enhance-sampling of one or more orthogonal CVs using a metadynamics
(MTD) like bias. The new hybrid method proposed here enables boosting the
sampling of more slow degrees of freedom in WSMTD simulations, without the need
to specify associated CVs, through a replica exchange scheme within the
framework of REST2. The high-dimensional slices of the probability
distributions of CVs computed from the united WSMTD and REST2 simulations are
subsequently combined using the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) to
obtain the free energy surface. We show that the new method proposed here is
accurate, improves the conformational sampling, and achieves quick convergence

Assuming particle DM, this exotic form of matter cannot consist of Standard
Model (SM) particles. Many models have been developed to attempt unraveling the
nature of DM such as Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), the most
favored particle candidates. WIMP annihilations and decay could produce SM
particles which in turn hadronize and decay to give SM secondaries such as high
energy $\gamma$ rays. In the framework of indirect DM search, observations of
promising targets are used to search for signatures of DM annihilation. Among

estimation are used to infer the linear coefficient (fixed effects) in a
partially linear mixed-effects model for repeated measurements. Using machine
learning algorithms allows us to incorporate complex interaction structures and
high-dimensional variables. We employ double machine learning to cope with the
nonparametric part of the partially linear mixed-effects model: the nonlinear
variables are regressed out nonparametrically from both the linear variables
and the response. This adjustment can be performed with any machine learning
algorithm, for instance random forests, which allows to take complex
interaction terms and nonsmooth structures into account. The adjusted variables
satisfy a linear mixed-effects model, where the linear coefficient can be
estimated with standard linear mixed-effects techniques. We prove that the
estimated fixed effects coefficient converges at the parametric rate, is
asymptotically Gaussian distributed, and semiparametrically efficient. Two
simulation studies demonstrate that our method outperforms a penalized
regression spline approach in terms of coverage. We also illustrate our
proposed approach on a longitudinal dataset with HIV-infected individuals.
Software code for our method is available in the R-package dmlalg.

$d$ for which there is an embedding of $G$ into $\mathbb{R}^d$, such that any
pair of disjoint edges is separated by some hyperplane normal to one of the
axes. The perfect separation dimension further requires that any pair of
disjoint edges is separated by the same amount of such (pairwise nonparallel)
hyperplanes. While it is known that for any fixed $r \ge 2$, the separation
dimension of any $n$-vertex $r$-graph is $O(\log n)$, the perfect separation
dimension is much larger. In fact, no polynomial upper-bound for the perfect
separation dimension of $r$-uniform hypergraphs is known.
  In our first result we essentially resolve the case $r=2$, i.e. graphs. We
prove that the perfect separation dimension of $K_n$ is linear in $n$, up to a
small polylogarithmic factor. In fact, we prove it is at least $n/2-1$ and at
most $n(\log n)^{1+o(1)}$.
  Our second result proves that the perfect separation dimension of almost all
graphs is also linear in $n$, up to a logarithmic factor. This follows as a
special case of a more general result showing that the perfect separation
dimension of the random graph $G(n,p)$ is w.h.p. $\Omega(n p /\log n)$ for a
wide range of values of $p$, including all constant $p$.
  Finally, we prove that significantly relaxing perfection to just requiring
that any pair of disjoint edges of $K_n$ is separated the same number of times
up to a difference of $c \log n$ for some absolute constant $c$, still requires
the dimension to be $\Omega(n)$. This is perhaps surprising as it is known that
if we allow a difference of $7\log_2 n$, then the dimension reduces to $O(\log
n)$.

simulations of sparse E-I networks composed of N spiking neurons with
analytical investigations of low dimensional neural mass models. The
bifurcation diagrams, derived for the neural mass model, allow to classify the
asynchronous and coherent behaviours emerging any finite in-degree K. In the
limit N >> K >> 1 both supra and sub-threshold balanced asynchronous regimes
can be observed. Due to structural heterogeneity the asynchronous states are
characterized by the splitting of the neurons in three groups: silent,
fluctuation and mean driven. The coherent rhythms are characterized by regular
or irregular temporal fluctuations joined to spatial coherence similar to
coherent fluctuations observed in the cortex over multiple spatial scales.
Collective Oscillations (COs) can emerge due to two different mechanisms. A
first mechanism similar to the pyramidal-interneuron gamma (PING) one. The
second mechanism is intimately related to the presence of current fluctuations,
which sustain COs characterized by an essentially simultaneous bursting of the
two populations. We observe period-doubling cascades involving the PING-like
COs finally leading to the appearance of coherent chaos. For sufficiently
strong current fluctuations we report a novel mechanism of frequency locking
among collective rhythms promoted by these intrinsic fluctuations. Our analysis
suggest that despite PING-like or fluctuation driven COS are observable for any

coexisting balanced regimes: an asynchronous and a fully synchronized one.

Agent must directly pack these items into the target bin stably without
changing their arrival order, and no further adjustment is permitted. Online
3D-BPP can be naturally formulated as Markov Decision Process (MDP). We adopt
deep reinforcement learning, in particular, the on-policy actor-critic
framework, to solve this MDP with constrained action space. To learn a
practically feasible packing policy, we propose three critical designs. First,
we propose an online analysis of packing stability based on a novel stacking
tree. It attains a high analysis accuracy while reducing the computational
complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N \log N)$, making it especially suited for RL
training. Second, we propose a decoupled packing policy learning for different
dimensions of placement which enables high-resolution spatial discretization
and hence high packing precision. Third, we introduce a reward function that
dictates the robot to place items in a far-to-near order and therefore
simplifies the collision avoidance in movement planning of the robotic arm.
Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive discussion on several key implemental
issues. The extensive evaluation demonstrates that our learned policy
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly and is practically
usable for real-world applications.

  reliably reveal consumer preferences for misinformation",,,,,"econ.TH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A great deal of empirical research has examined who falls for misinformation
and why. Here, we introduce a formal game-theoretic model of engagement with
news stories that captures the strategic interplay between (mis)information
consumers and producers. A key insight from the model is that observed patterns
of engagement do not necessarily reflect the preferences of consumers. This is
because producers seeking to promote misinformation can use strategies that
lead moderately inattentive readers to engage more with false stories than true
ones -- even when readers prefer more accurate over less accurate information.
We then empirically test people's preferences for accuracy in the news. In
three studies, we find that people strongly prefer to click and share news they
perceive as more accurate -- both in a general population sample, and in a
sample of users recruited through Twitter who had actually shared links to
misinformation sites online. Despite this preference for accurate news -- and
consistent with the predictions of our model -- we find markedly different
engagement patterns for articles from misinformation versus mainstream news
sites. Using 1,000 headlines from 20 misinformation and 20 mainstream news
sites, we compare Facebook engagement data with 20,000 accuracy ratings
collected in a survey experiment. Engagement with a headline is negatively
correlated with perceived accuracy for misinformation sites, but positively
correlated with perceived accuracy for mainstream sites. Taken together, these
theoretical and empirical results suggest that consumer preferences cannot be
straightforwardly inferred from empirical patterns of engagement. Rather,
understanding people's preferences requires that we account for the strategic
interplay between consumers and producers of news.

the effective rotation rate of a fluid (since the resonant frequencies are
modified by the flows). To be accurate, this method requires a prior knowledge
of the acoustic modes in rotating fluids. Contrary to the Coriolis force,
centrifugal gravity has received much less attention in the experimental
context. Motivated by on-going experiments in rotating ellipsoids, we study how
global rotation and buoyancy modify the acoustic modes of fluid-filled
ellipsoids in isothermal (or isentropic) hydrostatic equilibrium. We go beyond
the standard acoustic equation, which neglects solid-body rotation and gravity,
by deriving an exact wave equation for the acoustic velocity. We then solve the
wave problem using a polynomial spectral method in ellipsoids, which is
compared with finite-element solutions of the primitive fluid-dynamic
equations. We show that the centrifugal acceleration has measurable effects on
the acoustic frequencies when $M_\Omega \gtrsim 0.3$, where $M_\Omega$ is the
rotational Mach number defined as the ratio of the sonic and rotational time
scales. Such a regime can be reached with experiments rotating at a few tens of
Hz, by replacing air with a highly compressible gas (e.g. SF$_6$ or
C$_4$F$_8$).

overcome the ill-posed problem of image super-resolution by providing
additional information from a high-resolution reference image. Multi-reference
super-resolution extends this approach by providing a more diverse pool of
image features to overcome the inherent information deficit whilst maintaining
memory efficiency. A novel hierarchical attention-based sampling approach is
introduced to learn the similarity between low-resolution image features and
multiple reference images based on a perceptual loss. Ablation demonstrates the
contribution of both multi-reference and hierarchical attention-based sampling
to overall performance. Perceptual and quantitative ground-truth evaluation
demonstrates significant improvement in performance even when the reference
images deviate significantly from the target image. The project website can be

with the coherence length, so vortices should not form. This was confirmed by
the fact that no marked difference between the spectra with terahertz electric
field set perpendicular and parallel to the external magnetic field was
observed. Simultaneous use of Maxwell-Garnett effective medium theory and the
model of optical conductivity by Herman and Hlubina proved to correctly
reproduce the terahertz spectra obtained experimentally in a magnetic field of

pair-breaking effects was found to linearly increase with magnetic field.

order to consider the time varying nature of the parameters that define qubit
decoherence. This dynamic nature of quantum channels causes a degradation of
the performance of quantum error correction codes (QECC) that is portrayed as a
flattening of their error rate curves. In this article, we introduce the
concepts of quantum outage probability and quantum hashing outage probability
as asymptotically achievable error rates by a QECC with quantum rate $R_Q$
operating over a TVQC. We derive closed-form expressions for the family of
time-varying amplitude damping channels (TVAD) and study their behaviour for

the relative variation of $T_1$ around its mean. We conclude that the

their decoherence parameters and corroborate that parameter stability is
crucial to maintain the excellent performance observed over static quantum

performance of hypothetical policies leveraging only offline log data. It is
particularly useful in applications where the online interaction involves high
stakes and expensive setting such as precision medicine and recommender
systems. Since many OPE estimators have been proposed and some of them have
hyperparameters to be tuned, there is an emerging challenge for practitioners
to select and tune OPE estimators for their specific application.
Unfortunately, identifying a reliable estimator from results reported in
research papers is often difficult because the current experimental procedure
evaluates and compares the estimators' performance on a narrow set of
hyperparameters and evaluation policies. Therefore, it is difficult to know
which estimator is safe and reliable to use. In this work, we develop
Interpretable Evaluation for Offline Evaluation (IEOE), an experimental
procedure to evaluate OPE estimators' robustness to changes in hyperparameters
and/or evaluation policies in an interpretable manner. Then, using the IEOE
procedure, we perform extensive evaluation of a wide variety of existing
estimators on Open Bandit Dataset, a large-scale public real-world dataset for
OPE. We demonstrate that our procedure can evaluate the estimators' robustness
to the hyperparamter choice, helping us avoid using unsafe estimators. Finally,
we apply IEOE to real-world e-commerce platform data and demonstrate how to use
our protocol in practice.

The ESA PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) mission
will search for terrestrial planets in the habitable zone of solar-type stars.
Because of telemetry limitations, PLATO targets need to be pre-selected. Aims.
In this paper, we present an all sky catalogue that will be fundamental to
selecting the best PLATO fields and the most promising target stars, deriving
their basic parameters, analysing the instrumental performances, and then
planing and optimising follow-up observations. This catalogue also represents a
valuable resource for the general definition of stellar samples optimised for
the search of transiting planets. Methods. We used Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2)
astrometry and photometry and 3D maps of the local interstellar medium to
isolate FGK (V$\leq$13) and M (V$\leq$16) dwarfs and subgiant stars. Results.
We present the first public release of the all-sky PLATO Input Catalogue
(asPIC1.1) containing a total of 2 675 539 stars including 2 378 177 FGK dwarfs
and subgiants and 297 362 M dwarfs. The median distance in our sample is 428 pc
for FGK stars and 146 pc for M dwarfs, respectively. We derived the reddening
of our targets and developed an algorithm to estimate stellar fundamental
parameters (Teff, radius, mass) from astrometric and photometric measurements.
Conclusions. We show that the overall (internal+external) uncertainties on the
stellar parameter determined in the present study are $\sim$230 K (4%) for the
effective temperatures, $\sim$0.1 R$_{\odot}$ (9%) for the stellar radii, and
$\sim$0.1 M$_{\odot}$ (11%) for the stellar mass. We release a special target
list containing all known planet hosts cross-matched with our catalogue.

vaccination, and by their combination. We compare the epidemic burden for
subpopulations which apply competing or co-operative control strategies. The
simulation experiments are conducted on randomised social-contact graphs that
are designed to exhibit realistic person-person contact characteristics and
which follow near `homogeneous' or `block-localised' subpopulation spreading.
The scalarization method is used for the multi-objective optimization problem

description of deuteron scattering and resulting in a modification of the
two-body interactions in a three-body system, are investigated for several
$(d,p)$ reactions serving as indirect tools for studying the astrophysical
$(p,\gamma)$ reactions relevant to $rp$-process. The three-body nature of
deuteron-target potential is treated within adiabatic distorted wave
approximation (ADWA) which relies on dominant contribution from the components
of the three-body deuteron-target wave function with small $n$-$p$ separations.
This results in a simple prescription for treating the explicit
energy-dependence of two-body optical potentials in a three-body system
requiring nucleon optical potentials to be evaluated at a shifted energy with
respect to the standard value of half the deuteron incident energy. In
addition, the ADWA allows for leading-order multiple scattering effects to be
estimated, which leads to a simple renormalization of the adiabatic potential's
imaginary part by the factor of two. These effects are assessed using both
nonlocal and local optical potential systematics for $^{26}$Al, $^{30}$P,
$^{34}$Cl and $^{56}$Ni targets at deuteron incident energy of 12 MeV typical
for experiments with radioactive beams in inverse kinematics. The model
uncertainties induced by the three-body nature of deuteron-target scattering
are found to be within 40$\%$ both in the main peak of angular distributions
and in total $(d,p)$ cross sections. At higher deuteron energies, around 60
MeV, model uncertainties can reach 100\% in the total cross sections. A few
examples of application to astrophysically interesting proton resonances in
$^{27}$Si and $^{57}$Cu obtained using $(d,p)$ reactions and mirror symmetry

we formalize the equivalence of distance-based inverse kinematics and the

geometry and low-rank matrix completion to find inverse kinematics solutions by
completing a partial Euclidean distance matrix through local optimization.
Furthermore, we parametrize the space of Euclidean distance matrices with the
Riemannian manifold of fixed-rank Gram matrices, allowing us to leverage a
variety of mature Riemannian optimization methods. Finally, we show that bound
smoothing can be used to generate informed initializations without significant
computational overhead, improving convergence. We demonstrate that our inverse

The outcome of our reduction produces incompatible results between STIS visit 1

by modelling the WFC3 data alone, we can extract atmospheric information

A retrieval that includes an extreme photospheric activity of the host star is
the preferred model, but we recognise that such a scenario is unlikely for an

further observations with this instrument would allow us to properly constrain

a strong surface magnetic field potentially challenging the process of wind
magnetic braking. The Gaia satellite provides an accurate distance to that star
and confirms its membership to the sigma Ori cluster. We account for these two
key pieces of information to investigate whether single star models can
reproduce the observed properties of sigma Ori E and provide new estimates for
its metallicity, mass, and age. We compute rotating stellar models accounting
for wind magnetic braking and magnetic quenching of the mass loss. We obtain
that sigma Ori E is a very young star (age less than 1 Myr) with an initial
mass around 9 Msol, a surface equatorial magnetic field around 7 kG and having
a metallicity Z (mass fraction of heavy elements) around 0.020. No solution is
obtained with the present models for a metallicity Z=0.014. The initial
rotation of the models fitting sigma Ori E is not much constrained and can be
anywhere in the range studied in the present work. Because of its very young
age, models predict no observable changes of the surface abundances due to
rotational mixing. The simultaneous high surface rotation and high surface
magnetic field of sigma Ori E may simply be a consequence of its young age.
This young age implies that the processes responsible for producing the
chemical inhomogeneities that are observed at its surface should be rapid. Thus
for explaining the properties of sigma Ori E, there is no necessity to invoke a
merging event although such a scenario cannot be discarded. Other stars (HR
5907, HR 7355, HR 345439, HD 2347, CPD -50^{o}3509$) showing similar properties
as sigma Ori E (fast rotation and strong surface magnetic field) may also be
very young stars, although determination of the braking timescales is needed to
confirm such a conclusion.

perform poorly on multidimensional array scientific data. Bitmap indices are
widely used in commercial databases for processing complex queries, due to
their effective use of bit-wise operations and space-efficiency. However,
bitmap indices apply natively to relational or linearized datasets, which is
especially notable in binned or compressed indices.
  We propose a new method for multidimensional array indexing that overcomes
the dimensionality-induced inefficiencies. The hierarchical indexing method is
based on $n$-di\-men\-sional sparse trees for dimension partitioning, with
bound number of individual, adaptively binned indices for attribute
partitioning. This indexing performs well on range involving both dimensions
and attributes, as it prunes the search space early, avoids reading entire
index data, and does at most a single index traversal. Moreover, the indexing
is easily extensible to membership queries.
  The indexing method was implemented on top of a state of the art bitmap
indexing library Fastbit. We show that the hierarchical bitmap index
outperforms conventional bitmap indexing built on auxiliary attribute for each
dimension. Furthermore, the adaptive binning significantly reduces the amount
of bins and therefore memory requirements.

solitons in the long wave-short wave resonance interaction (LSRI) system. The
model that we consider here describes the nonlinear interaction of the
long-wave and two-short waves and it generically appears in several physical
settings. To derive this class of nondegenerate vector soliton solutions we
adopt the Hirota bilinear method with the more general form of admissible seed
solutions with nonidentical distinct propagation constants. We express the
resultant fundamental as well as multi-soliton solutions in a compact way using
Gram-determinants. The general fundamental vector soliton solution possesses
several interesting properties. For instance, the double-hump or a single-hump
profile structure including a special flattop profile form results in when the
soliton propagates in all the components with identical velocities.
Interestingly, in the case of nonidentical velocities, the soliton number is
increased to two in the long-wave (LW) component, while a single-humped soliton
propagates in the two short-wave (SW) components. We establish through a
detailed analysis that the nondegenerate multi-solitons in contrast to the
already known vector solitons (with identical wave numbers) can undergo three
types of elastic collision scenarios: (i) shape preserving, (ii) shape
altering, and (iii) a novel shape changing collision, depending on the choice
of the soliton parameters. In addition, we point out the coexistence of
nondegenerate and degenerate solitons simultaneously along with the associated
physical consequences. We also indicate the physical realizations of these
general vector solitons in nonlinear optics, hydrodynamics, and Bose-Einstein
condensates. Our results are generic and they will be useful in these physical
systems and other closely related systems including plasma physics.

the quality of the captured dynamic texture appearance which depends on both
the camera resolution and capture volume. Typically the requirement to frame
cameras to capture the volume of a dynamic performance ($>50m^3$) results in
the person occupying only a small proportion $<$ 10% of the field of view. Even
with ultra high-definition 4k video acquisition this results in sampling the
person at less-than standard definition 0.5k video resolution resulting in
low-quality rendering. In this paper we propose a solution to this problem
through super-resolution appearance transfer from a static high-resolution
appearance capture rig using digital stills cameras ($> 8k$) to capture the
person in a small volume ($<8m^3$). A pipeline is proposed for super-resolution
appearance transfer from high-resolution static capture to dynamic video
performance capture to produce super-resolution dynamic textures. This
addresses two key problems: colour mapping between different camera systems;
and dynamic texture map super-resolution using a learnt model. Comparative
evaluation demonstrates a significant qualitative and quantitative improvement
in rendering the 4D performance capture with super-resolution dynamic texture
appearance. The proposed approach reproduces the high-resolution detail of the
static capture whilst maintaining the appearance dynamics of the captured

exponentially richer than that of clausal formulas. Yet, clausal efficiency
outperforms non-clausal one. Indeed, a major weakness of the latter is that,
while Horn clausal formulas, along with Horn algorithms, are crucial for the
high efficiency of clausal reasoning, no Horn-like formulas in non-clausal form
had been proposed. To overcome such weakness, we define the hybrid class
$\mathbb{H_{NC}}$ of Horn Non-Clausal (Horn-NC) formulas, by adequately lifting
the Horn pattern to NC form, and argue that $\mathbb{H_{NC}}$, along with
future Horn-NC algorithms, shall increase non-clausal efficiency just as the
Horn class has increased clausal efficiency. Secondly, we: (i) give the
compact, inductive definition of $\mathbb{H_{NC}}$; (ii) prove that
syntactically $\mathbb{H_{NC}}$ subsumes the Horn class but semantically both
classes are equivalent, and (iii) characterize the non-clausal formulas

Unit-Resolution calculus, $UR_{NC}$, and prove that it checks the
satisfiability of $\mathbb{H_{NC}}$ in polynomial time. This fact, to our
knowledge, makes $\mathbb{H_{NC}}$ the first characterized polynomial class in

recognizable, and also that it is both strictly succincter and exponentially
richer than the Horn class. We discuss that in NC automated reasoning, e.g.
satisfiability solving, theorem proving, logic programming, etc., can directly
benefit from $\mathbb{H_{NC}}$ and $UR_{NC}$ and that, as a by-product of its
proved properties, $\mathbb{H_{NC}}$ arises as a new alternative to analyze

The free energy barriers to crystallisation are computed using umbrella

reconstruct the free energy from a mean first passage time formulation. We
focus on state points that have been described in earlier work [Sastry and
Angell, Nature Mater., 2, 739, 2003] as straddling a first order liquid-liquid
phase transition (LLPT) between two metastable liquid states. It was argued
subsequently [Ricci et al., Mol. Phys., 117, 3254, 2019] that the apparent
phase transition is in fact due the loss of metastability of the liquid state
with respect to the globally stable crystalline state. The presence or absence
of a barrier to crystallization for these state points is therefore of
importance to ascertain, with due attention to ambiguities that may arise from
the choice of order parameters. We discuss our choice of order parameters and
also our choice of methods to calculate the free energy at deep supercooling.
We find a well-defined free energy barrier to crystallisation and demonstrate
that both umbrella sampling and mean first passage time methods yield results
that agree quantitatively. Our results thus provide strong evidence against the
possibility that the liquids at state points close to the reported LLPT exhibit
slow, spontaneous crystallisation, but they do not address the existence of a
LLPT (or lack thereof). We also compute the free energy barriers to
crystallisation at other state points over a broad range of temperatures and
pressures, and discuss the effect of changes in the microscopic structure of
the metastable liquid on the free energy barrier heights.

Using a suitably defined, feasible candidate solution based on an auxiliary
observer, robust stability of the proposed suboptimal estimator is inherited
independently of the horizon length and even if no optimization is performed.
Moreover, the proposed design allows for the choice between two cost functions
different in structure: the former in the manner of a standard least squares
approach, which is typically used in practice, and the latter following a
time-discounted modification, resulting in better theoretical guarantees. We
apply the proposed suboptimal estimator to a nonlinear chemical reactor
process, verify the theoretical assumptions, and show that even a few

  silico",,,,,"q-bio.BM physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Far from being a passive information store, the genome is a mechanically
dynamic and diverse system in which torsion and tension fluctuate and combine
to determine structure and help regulate gene expression. Much of this
mechanical perturbation is due to molecular machines such as topoisomerases
which must stretch and twist DNA as part of various functions including DNA
repair and replication. While the broad-scale mechanical response of nucleic
acids to tension and torsion is well characterized, detail at the single base
pair level is beyond the limits of even super-resolution imaging. Here, we
present a straightforward, flexible, and extensible umbrella-sampling protocol
to twist and stretch nucleic acids in silico using the popular biomolecular
simulation package Amber -- though the principles we describe are applicable
also to other packages such as GROMACS. We discuss how to set up the simulation
system, decide forcefields and solvation models, and equilibrate. We then
introduce the torsionally-constrained stretching protocol, and finally we
present some analysis techniques we have used to characterize structural motif
formation. Rather than define forces or fictional pseudoatoms, we instead
define a fixed translation of specified atoms between each umbrella sampling
step, which allows comparison with experiment without needing to estimate
applied forces by simply using the fractional end-to-end displacement as a
comparison metric. We hope that this easy to implement solution will be
valuable for interrogating optical and magnetic tweezers data on nucleic acids
at base pair resolution.

segmentation of MR images using a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained with
chest computed tomography (CT) datasets. The feasibility is demonstrated for 2D
coronal ultra-fast balanced steady-state free precession (ufSSFP) MRI.
  Methods: Lung lobes of 250 publicly accessible CT datasets of adults were
segmented with an open-source CT-specific algorithm. To match 2D ufSSFP MRI
data of pediatric patients, both CT data and segmentations were translated into
pseudo-MR images, masked to suppress anatomy outside the lung. Network-1 was
trained with pseudo-MR images and lobe segmentations, and applied to 1000
masked ufSSFP images to predict lobe segmentations. These outputs were directly
used as targets to train Network-2 and Network-3 with non-masked ufSSFP data as
inputs, and an additional whole-lung mask as input for Network-2. Network
predictions were compared to reference manual lobe segmentations of ufSSFP data
in twenty pediatric cystic fibrosis patients. Manual lobe segmentations were
performed by splitting available whole-lung segmentations into lobes.
  Results: Network-1 was able to segment the lobes of ufSSFP images, and
Network-2 and Network-3 further increased segmentation accuracy and robustness.
The average all-lobe Dice similarity coefficients were 95.0$\pm$2.8
(mean$\pm$pooled SD [%]), 96.4$\pm$2.0, 93.0$\pm$2.0, and the average median
Hausdorff distances were 6.1$\pm$0.9 (mean$\pm$SD [mm]), 5.3$\pm$1.1,
7.1$\pm$1.3, for Network-1, Network-2, and Network-3, respectively.
  Conclusions: RNN lung lobe segmentation of 2D ufSSFP imaging is feasible, in
good agreement with manual segmentations. The proposed workflow might provide
access to automated lobe segmentations for various lung MRI examinations and
quantitative analyses.

We find that M5 is a mono-metallic GC with a small metallicity dispersion. Our
carbon abundances show that the $\sigma$[C/Fe] of the M5 CN-s population, with
depleted carbon and enhanced nitrogen abundances, is significantly large for a
single stellar population. Our new analysis reveals that the M5 CN-s population
is well described by the two stellar populations: the CN-s$_{\rm I}$, being the
major CN-s component, with the intermediate carbon and nitrogen abundance and
the CN-s$_{\rm E}$ with the most carbon-poor and nitrogen-rich abundance. We
find that the CN-s$_{\rm E}$ is significantly more centrally concentrated than
the others, while CN-w and CN-s$_{\rm I}$ have similar cumulative radial
distributions. The red giant branch bump $V$ magnitude, the helium abundance
barometer in mono-metallic populations, of individual populations appears to be
correlated with their mean carbon abundance, indicating that carbon abundances
are anticorrelated with helium abundances. We propose that the CN-s$_{\rm E}$
formed out of gas that experienced proton-capture processes at high
temperatures in the innermost region of the proto-GC of M5 that resided in a
dense ambient density environment. Shortly after, the CN-s$_{\rm I}$ formed out
of gas diluted from the pristine gas in the more spatially extended region,

compounds from microalgae were virtually screened against the modeled protein

a good binding score comparable, greater or a bit lower than that of the
standard inhibitor (camostat). Physicochemical properties, ADME (absorption,

depths, we investigate transition paths of NADW in its upper (UNADW) and lower
(LNADW) layers. We find that the majority of UNADW transition paths sourced in
the Labrador and southwestern Irminger Seas reach the western side of a target
arranged zonally along the southern edge of the subpolar North Atlantic domain
visited by the floats. This is accomplished in the form of a well-organized
deep boundary current (DBC). LNADW transition paths sourced west of the
Reykjanes Ridge reveal a similar pattern, while those sourced east of the ridge
are found to hit the western side of the target via a DBC and also several
other places along it in a less organized fashion, indicating southward flow
along the eastern and western flanks of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Naked-eye
inspection of trajectories suggest generally much more diffusive equatorward
NADW routes. A source-independent dynamical decomposition of the flow domain
into analogous backward-time basins of attraction, beyond the reach of direct
inspection of trajectories, reveals a much wider influence of the western side
of the target for UNADW than for LNADW. For UNADW, the average expected
duration of the pathways from the Labrador and Irminger Seas was found to be of
2 to 3 years. For LNADW, the duration was found to be influenced by the
Reykjanes Ridge, being as long as 8 years from the western side of the ridge
and of about 3 years on average from its eastern side.

widely used evolutionary algorithms for minimising optimisation and practical
problems in nearly all fields. In this thesis, a new evolutionary clustering
algorithm star (ECA*) is proposed. Additionally, a number of experiments were
conducted to evaluate ECA* against five state-of-the-art approaches. For this,
32 heterogeneous and multi-featured datasets were used to examine their
performance using internal and external clustering measures, and to measure the
sensitivity of their performance towards dataset features in the form of
operational framework. The results indicate that ECA* overcomes its competitive
techniques in terms of the ability to find the right clusters. Based on its
superior performance, exploiting and adapting ECA* on the ontology learning had
a vital possibility. In the process of deriving concept hierarchies from
corpora, generating formal context may lead to a time-consuming process.
Therefore, formal context size reduction results in removing uninterested and
erroneous pairs, taking less time to extract the concept lattice and concept
hierarchies accordingly. In this premise, this work aims to propose a framework
to reduce the ambiguity of the formal context of the existing framework using
an adaptive version of ECA*. In turn, an experiment was conducted by applying
385 sample corpora from Wikipedia on the two frameworks to examine the
reduction of formal context size, which leads to yield concept lattice and
concept hierarchy. The resulting lattice of formal context was evaluated to the
original one using concept lattice-invariants. Accordingly, the homomorphic
between the two lattices preserves the quality of resulting concept hierarchies
by 89% in contrast to the basic ones, and the reduced concept lattice inherits
the structural relation of the original one.

detection, logo detection is a challenging task, especially for small logo
objects and large aspect ratio logo objects in the real-world scenario. In this
paper, we propose a novel approach, named Discriminative Semantic Feature
Pyramid Network with Guided Anchoring (DSFP-GA), which can address these
challenges via aggregating the semantic information and generating different
aspect ratio anchor boxes. More specifically, our approach mainly consists of
Discriminative Semantic Feature Pyramid (DSFP) and Guided Anchoring (GA).
Considering that low-level feature maps that are used to detect small logo
objects lack semantic information, we propose the DSFP, which can enrich more
discriminative semantic features of low-level feature maps and can achieve
better performance on small logo objects. Furthermore, preset anchor boxes are
less efficient for detecting large aspect ratio logo objects. We therefore
integrate the GA into our method to generate large aspect ratio anchor boxes to
mitigate this issue. Extensive experimental results on four benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DSFP-GA. Moreover, we further
conduct visual analysis and ablation studies to illustrate the advantage of our
method in detecting small and large aspect logo objects. The code and models

interference (MUI) with consideration of bounded channel uncertainty. The joint
beamforming design is formulated into a nonconvex worst-case robust programming
to minimize the transmit power subject to single-to-noise ratio (SNR)
requirements. To address the challenges due to the constant modulus and the
coupling of the beamformers, we first study the single-user case. Specifically,
we propose and compare two algorithms based on the semidefinite relaxation

that the AO-based algorithm has much lower computational complexity but with
almost the same power to the SDR-based algorithm. Then, we apply the AO
technique to the multiuser case and thereby develop an algorithm based on the
proximal gradient descent (PGD) method. The algorithm can be generalized to the
case of finite-resolution IRS and the scenario with direct links from the
transmitter to the users. Numerical results show that the SLP can significantly
improve the system performance. Meanwhile, 3-bit phase shifters can achieve

subjected to a Zeeman field and thus does not exhibit nontrivial
single-particle band topology. Of special interest then is the role of particle
interaction as well as its interplay with the symmetry properties of the system
in producing topologically non-trivial excitations. We find that the
non-interacting system possesses a rich set of symmetries, including the
$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, the modified dihedral point group symmetry $\tilde
D_4$ and the nonsymmorphic symmetry. These combined symmetries ensure the
existence of pairs of degenerate Dirac points at the edge of Brillouin zone for
the single-particle energy bands. In the presence of particle interaction and
with sufficient spin-orbit coupling, the atoms condense in a ground state with
net magnetization which spontaneously breaks the $\mathcal{PT}$ and $\tilde
D_4$ symmetry. We demonstrate that this symmetry breaking leads to a gap
opening at the Dirac point for the Bogoliubov spectrum and consequentially
topologically non-trivial excitations. We confirm the non-trivial topology by
calculating the Chern numbers of the lowest excitation bands and show that
gapless edge states form at the interface of systems characterized by different

the practical application of model predictive control are the online
computational cost and burden of the existence frameworks. For model predictive
control of T-S fuzzy large-scale systems, the online computational burden is
even worse and in some cases, they cannot be solved in an expected time.
Especially for severe large-scale systems with disturbances, existing model
predictive control of T-S fuzzy large-scale systems usually leads to a very
conservative solution. So, researchers have many challenges and difficulties in
finding a reasonable solution in a short time. Although, more relaxed results
can be achieved by the proposed fuzzy model predictive control approach which
adopts T-S large-scale systems with nonlinear subsystems, many restrictions are
not considered in these approaches. In this paper, challenges are solved and
the MPC is designed for a nonlinear IT2 fuzzy large-scale system with
uncertainties and disturbances. Besides, online optimization problem is solved

required for accurate planetary applications, which has hitherto been largely
overlooked in ellipsoidal models. To go beyond the incompressible theory, we
present a Galerkin method in rigid coreless ellipsoids, based on a global
polynomial description. We apply the method to investigate the normal modes of
fully compressible, rotating and diffusionless fluids. We consider an idealized
model, which fairly reproduces the density variations in the Earth's liquid
core and Jupiter-like gaseous planets. We successfully benchmark the results
against standard finite-element computations. Notably, we find that the
quasi-geostrophic inertial modes can be significantly modified by
compressibility, even in moderately compressible interiors. Finally, we discuss
the use of the normal modes to build reduced dynamical models of planetary

in real world settings, but most modern defenses have narrow scope and
expensive costs. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised method to detect
adversarial attacks and classify them to their respective threat models, based
on a linear model operating on the embeddings from a pre-trained
self-supervised encoder. We use a SimCLR encoder in our experiments, since we
show the SimCLR embedding distance is a good proxy for human perceptibility,
enabling it to encapsulate many threat models at once. We call our method
SimCat since it uses SimCLR encoder to catch and categorize various types of
adversarial attacks, including L_p and non-L_p evasion attacks, as well as data
poisonings. The simple nature of a linear classifier makes our method efficient
in both time and sample complexity. For example, on SVHN, using only five pairs
of clean and adversarial examples computed with a PGD-L_inf attack, SimCat's
detection accuracy is over 85%. Moreover, on ImageNet, using only 25 examples
from each threat model, SimCat can classify eight different attack types such
as PGD-L_2, PGD-L_inf, CW-L_2, PPGD, LPA, StAdv, ReColor, and JPEG-L_inf, with
over 40% accuracy. On STL10 data, we apply SimCat as a defense against
poisoning attacks, such as BP, CP, FC, CLBD, HTBD, halving the success rate
while using only twenty total poisons for training. We find that the detectors
generalize well to unseen threat models. Lastly, we investigate the performance
of our detection method under adaptive attacks and further boost its robustness

math-related contexts. Originally thought to affect only inexperienced,
low-achieving students, recent investigations show how math anxiety is vastly
diffused even among high-performing learners. This review of data-informed
studies outlines math anxiety as a complex system that: (i) cripples
well-being, self-confidence and information processing on both conscious and
subconscious levels, (ii) can be transmitted by social interactions, like a
pathogen, and worsened by distorted perceptions, (iii) affects roughly 20% of
students in 63 out of 64 worldwide educational systems but correlates weakly
with academic performance, and (iv) poses a concrete threat to students'
well-being, computational literacy and career prospects in science. These
patterns underline the crucial need to go beyond performance for estimating
math anxiety. Recent advances with network psychometrics and cognitive network
science provide ideal frameworks for detecting, interpreting and intervening
upon such clinical condition. Merging education research, psychology and data
science, the approaches reviewed here reconstruct psychological constructs as
complex systems, represented either as multivariate correlation models (e.g.
graph exploratory analysis) or as cognitive networks of semantic/emotional
associations (e.g. free association networks or forma mentis networks). Not
only can these interconnected networks detect otherwise hidden levels of math
anxiety but - more crucially - they can unveil the specific layout of
interacting factors, e.g. key sources and targets, behind math anxiety in a
given cohort. As discussed here, these network approaches open concrete ways
for unveiling students' perceptions, emotions and mental well-being, and can
enable future powerful data-informed interventions untangling math anxiety.

rough estimation of the phonon mean free path ($\ell_\textrm{ph}$) from the

An extrapolation of $\ell_\textrm{ph}$ to higher temperatures indicates that
this system approaches the Ioffe-Regel limit at about 1100 K. In light of the
phonon dispersions, we argue that the ultralow $\ell_\textrm{ph}$ is attributed
to intense anharmonic phonon-phonon scattering, including Umklapp process and

frequently in practice. Proper analysis of such data needs to consider not only
dependencies on-sight but also dependencies in and in-between variables as a
function of spatial separation. Spatial Blind Source Separation (SBSS) is a
recently developed unsupervised statistical tool that deals with such data by
assuming that the observable data is formed by a linear latent variable model.
In SBSS the latent variable is assumed to be constituted by weakly stationary
random fields which are uncorrelated. Such a model is appealing as further
analysis can be carried out on the marginal distributions of the latent
variables, interpretations are straightforward as the model is assumed to be
linear, and not all components of the latent field might be of interest which
acts as a form of dimension reduction. The weakly stationarity assumption of
SBSS implies that the mean of the data is constant for all sample locations,
which might be too restricting in practical applications. Therefore, an
adaptation of SBSS that uses scatter matrices based on differences was recently
suggested in the literature. In our contribution we formalize these ideas,
suggest an adapted SBSS method and show its usefulness on synthetic and real

The key idea is to embed the mesh into a high-dimensional space, such that the
Euclidean distance in the high-dimensional space can induce the geodesic
distance in the original manifold surface. However, directly solving the
high-dimensional embedding problem is not feasible due to the large number of
variables and the fact that the embedding problem is highly nonlinear. We
overcome the challenges with two novel ideas. First, instead of taking all
vertices as variables, we embed only the saddle vertices, which greatly reduces
the problem complexity. We then compute a local embedding for each non-saddle
vertex. Second, to reduce the large approximation error resulting from the
purely Euclidean embedding, we propose a cascaded optimization approach that
repeatedly introduces additional embedding coordinates with a non-Euclidean
function to reduce the approximation residual. Using the precomputation data,
our approach can determine the geodesic distance between any two vertices in
near-constant time. Computational testing results show that our method is more
desirable than previous geodesic distance queries methods.

loss can notice changes in neural network structure because it is very strict,

channel estimation exploits space-time channel sparsity through the computation
of position-dependent MIMO channel eigenmodes leveraging recurrent training
vehicle passages in the coverage cell. LR requires vehicles' geographical
positions and tens to hundreds of training vehicles' passages for each
position, leading to significant complexity and control signalling overhead.
Here we design a DL-based LR channel estimation method to infer MIMO channel

and without needing vehicle's position information. Numerical results show that
the proposed method attains comparable Mean Squared Error (MSE) performance as
the position-based LR. Moreover, we show that the proposed model can be trained
on a reference scenario and be effectively transferred to urban contexts with
different space-time channel features, providing comparable MSE performance

considers the reproduction number which measures the amount of secondary cases

of the well established estimator of the country level reproduction number to
the county level by applying techniques from small-area estimation. This new
estimator yields sensible estimates of reproduction numbers both on the country

been proposed to that effect, but the recent shift in focus towards network

rendered them void of performance guarantees. We here introduce a new measure
of node's centrality, which is no longer a scalar value, but a vector with
dimension one lower than the highest order of interaction in a hypergraph. Such
a vectorial measure is linked to the eigenvector centrality for networks
containing only dyadic interactions, but it has a significant added value in
all other situations where interactions occur at higher-orders. In particular,
it is able to unveil different roles which may be played by the same node at
different orders of interactions -- information that is otherwise impossible to
retrieve by single scalar measures. We demonstrate the efficacy of our measure
with applications to synthetic networks and to three real world hypergraphs,
and compare our results with those obtained by applying other scalar measures
of centrality proposed in the literature.

nonlinear target (the tag), causing the return signal to consist of harmonics
at multiples of the transmitted carrier frequency. Of them, the second harmonic
is usually the strongest and the one to which the receiver is tuned. This
frequency difference distinguishes the tag reflection from environmental
clutter, which remains at the uplink (transmitter to tag) frequency. However,
the passive nature of HR tags severely limits the reflected power, and
therefore the range of the downlink (tag to receiver) path. We propose to
increase the range and/or signal to noise ratio (SNR) by novel restructuring at
the physical and signal levels. For this, we accompany the original transmitter
with auxiliary transmitters able to send simple tones that are synchronized to
arrive at the tag in phase, and we design the receiver to detect an
intermodulation component. The resulting range and SNR are much greater than
those of the original, conventional HR system, and greater even than if the
original system were to transmit with power equal to the aggregate power of our
new system. Achieving mutually coherent, i.e., in phase, arrival of the tones
at the tag is the focus of the present paper. We provide a system framework
that models the tag and the uplink and downlink, then present the adaptive
phase coherence algorithm and analyze the probabilistic growth of the output
signal power. We also account for the effects of frequency shifts due to
transmitter mobility and the frequency offset errors in the transmitter local
oscillators.

interpreted as a measure of cell aggregation and as a biomarker of
inflammation. It is well known that an increase of fibrinogen concentration, an
aggregation-inducing protein for erythrocytes, leads to an increase of the
sedimentation rate of erythrocytes, which is generally explained through the
formation and faster settling of large disjoint aggregates. However, many
aspects of erythrocyte sedimentation conform well with the collapse of a
colloidal gel rather than with the sedimentation of disjoint aggregates. Using
experiments and cell-level numerical simulations, we systematically investigate
the dependence of ESR on fibrinogen concentration and its relation to the
microstructure of the gel-like erythrocyte suspension. We show that for
physiological aggregation interactions, an increase in the attraction strength
between cells results in a cell network with larger void spaces. This
geometrical change in the network structure occurs due to anisotropic shape and
deformability of erythrocytes and leads to an increased gel permeability and
faster sedimentation. Our results provide a comprehensive relation between the
ESR and the cell-level structure of erythrocyte suspensions and support the gel

generate synthetic question-answer pairs that are used for training. However,
existing methods for question generation rely on large amounts of synthetically
generated datasets and costly computational resources, which render these
techniques widely inaccessible when the text corpora is of limited size. This
is problematic as many niche domains rely on small text corpora, which
naturally restricts the amount of synthetic data that can be generated. In this

domain adaptation for QA (CAQA). Specifically, CAQA combines techniques from
question generation and domain-invariant learning to answer out-of-domain
questions in settings with limited text corpora. Here, we train a QA system on
both source data and generated data from the target domain with a contrastive
adaptation loss that is incorporated in the training objective. By combining
techniques from question generation and domain-invariant learning, our model
achieved considerable improvements compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

approach for common support recovery of a row-sparse matrix. However, compared
to the noiseless scenario, the performance analysis of noisy SOMP is still
nascent, especially in the scenario of unbounded noise. In this paper, we
present a new study based on the mutual incoherence property (MIP) for
performance analysis of noisy SOMP. Specifically, when noise is bounded, we
provide the condition on which the exact support recovery is guaranteed in
terms of the MIP. When noise is unbounded, we instead derive a bound on the
successful recovery probability (SRP) that depends on the specific distribution
of the $\ell_2$-norm of the noise matrix. Then we focus on the common case when
noise is random Gaussian and show that the lower bound of SRP follows
Tracy-Widom law distribution. The analysis reveals the number of measurements,
noise level, the number of sparse vectors, and the value of mutual coherence
that are required to guarantee a predefined recovery performance.
Theoretically, we show that the mutual coherence of the measurement matrix must
decrease proportionally to the noise standard deviation, and the number of
sparse vectors needs to grow proportionally to the noise variance. Finally, we
extensively validate the derived analysis through numerical simulations.

types to the properties of the progenitors remains an open issue. Rotation and
magnetic fields in Wolf-Rayet stars of subsolar metallicity may explain extreme
events such as superluminous supernovae and gamma-ray bursts powered by
proto-magnetars or collapsars. Continuing numerical studies of
magnetorotational core collapse including detailed neutrino physics, we focus
on progenitors with zero-age main-sequence masses in the range between 5 and 39
solar masses. The pre-collapse stars are one dimensional models employing
prescriptions for the effects of rotation and magnetic fields. Eight of the ten
stars we consider being the results of chemically homogeneous evolution due to
enhanced rotational mixing (Aguilera-Dena et al. 2018). All but one of them
produce explosions driven by neutrino heating (more likely for low mass
progenitors up to 8 solar masses) and non-spherical flows or by
magnetorotational stresses (more frequent above 26 solar masses). In most of
them and for the one non-exploding model, ongoing accretion leads to black-hole
formation. Rapid rotation makes a subsequent collapsar activity plausible.
Models not forming black holes show proto-magnetar driven jets. Conditions for
the formation of nickel are more favourable in magneto-rotationally driven
models, though our rough estimates fall short of the requirements for extremely
bright events if these are powered by radioactive decay. However, approximate
light curves of our models suggest that a proto-magnetar or black hole

architecture to synthesize a multiple-instance depth image with independent

random noise vectors), each encoding the 3D pose of an object that is
represented by a learned implicit object template. The generator has two
distinct modules. The first module, the instance feature generator, uses each
encoded pose to transform the implicit template into a feature map
representation of each object instance. The second module, the depth image
renderer, aggregates all of the single-instance feature maps output by the
first module and generates a multiple-instance depth image. A discriminator
distinguishes the generated multiple-instance depth images from the

evaluate our approach, we introduce a new synthetic dataset, ""Insta-10"",
consisting of 100,000 depth images, each with 5 instances of an object from one
of 10 classes. Our experiments on Insta-10, as well as on real-world noisy
depth images, show that InSeGAN achieves state-of-the-art performance, often

electroacoustic actuator operating on the atmospheric corona discharge
principle is used to achieve sound absorption in real-time. Two control
strategies are introduced and tested for both normal in the impedance tube and
grazing incidence in the flow duct. The performance of plasma-based active
absorber is competitive with conventional passive technologies in terms of
effective absorption bandwidth and low-frequency operation, however, it
presents some inherent limitations that are discussed. The study reveals that
the corona discharge technology is suitable for active noise control in ducts

provides superior focal resolution, due to the finer sampling capability of its
deeply-subwavelength metasurface particles compared to that of typical array
antenna elements, 2) it features much lower complexity and cost, due to its
direct illumination principle compared to the heavy feeding network of the
array system. The system leverages reflecting metallic walls and a rich

of generative models. Recently, multiple works have explored possible
techniques to generate such modifications using the latent structure of
pre-trained GAN models. However, such approaches often require training an
encoder network and that is typically a time-consuming and resource intensive
process. A possible alternative to such a GAN-based architecture can be
styleALAE, a latent-space based autoencoder that can generate photo-realistic

does not preserve the identity of the input facial image. This limits the
application of styleALAE for semantic face editing of images with known
identities. In our work, we use a recent advancement in one-shot domain
adaptation to address this problem. Our work ensures that the identity of the
reconstructed image is the same as the given input image. We further generate
semantic modifications over the reconstructed image by using the latent space

of various spherical packing phases. The results are summarized in a set of
phase diagrams covering a large phase space of the system. Besides the commonly
observed body-centered-cubic (BCC) phase, complex spherical packing phases
including the Frank-Kasper A15 and $\sigma$ and the Laves C14 and C15 phases
could be stabilized by the addition of longer A$_2$B$_2$-copolymers to
asymmetric A$_1$B$_1$-copolymers. Stabilizing the complex spherical packing
phases requires that the added A$_2$B$_2$-copolymers have a longer A-block and
an overall chain length at least comparable to the host copolymer chains. A
detailed analysis of the block distributions reveals the existence of inter-
and intra-domain segregation of different copolymers, which depends sensitively
on the copolymer length ratio and composition. The predicted phase behaviours
of the A$_1$B$_1$/A$_2$B$_2$ diblock copolymer blends are in good agreement
with available experimental and theoretical results. The study demonstrated
that binary blends of diblock copolymers provide an efficient route to regulate

stochastic gradient descent automatically. In traditional optimization, line
searches are a commonly used method to determine step sizes. One problem in
Deep Learning is that finding appropriate step sizes on the full-batch loss is
unfeasibly expensive. Therefore, classical line search approaches, designed for
losses without inherent noise, are usually not applicable. Recent empirical
findings suggest, inter alia, that the full-batch loss behaves locally
parabolically in the direction of noisy update step directions. Furthermore,
the trend of the optimal update step size changes slowly. By exploiting these
and more findings, this work introduces a line-search method that approximates
the full-batch loss with a parabola estimated over several mini-batches.
Learning rates are derived from such parabolas during training. In the
experiments conducted, our approach is on par with SGD with Momentum tuned with
a piece-wise constant learning rate schedule and often outperforms other line
search approaches for Deep Learning across models, datasets, and batch sizes on
validation and test accuracy. In addition, our approach is the first line
search approach for Deep Learning that samples a larger batch size over
multiple inferences to still work in low-batch scenarios.

injection of 180$^\circ$ domain walls (DW) from a nucleation pad into magnetic
nanowires, as typically used for DW-based sensors. In our study the strain,
generated by substrate bending, induces in the material a uniaxial anisotropy
due to magnetoelastic coupling. To compare the strain effects,
$Co_{40}Fe_{40}B_{20}$, $Ni$ and $Ni_{82}Fe_{18}$ samples with in-plane
magnetization and different magnetoelastic coupling are deposited. In these
samples, we measure the magnetic field required for the injection of a DW, by
imaging differential contrast in a magneto-optical Kerr microscope. We find
that strain increases the DW injection field, however, the switching mechanism
depends strongly on the direction of the strain with respect to the wire axis.
We observe that low magnetic anisotropy facilitates the creation of a domain
wall at the junction between the pad and the wire, whereas a strain-induced
magnetic easy axis significantly increases the coercive field of the nucleation
pad. Additionally, we find that the effects of mechanical strain can be
counteracted by a magnetic uniaxial anisotropy perpendicular to the
strain-induced easy axis. In $Co_{40}Fe_{40}B_{20}$, we show that this
anisotropy can be induced by annealing in a magnetic field. We perform
micromagnetic simulations to support the interpretation of our experimental
findings. Our simulations show that the above described observations can be
explained by the effective anisotropy in the device. The anisotropy influences
the switching mechanism in the nucleation pad as well as the pinning of the DW
at the wire entrance. As the DW injection is a key operation for sensor
performances, the observations show that strain is imposing a lower limit for
the sensor field operating window.

applied and recently proved vulnerable under backdoor attacks: the released
pre-trained weights can be maliciously poisoned with certain triggers. When the
triggers are activated, even the fine-tuned model will predict pre-defined
labels, causing a security threat. These backdoors generated by the poisoning
methods can be erased by changing hyper-parameters during fine-tuning or
detected by finding the triggers. In this paper, we propose a stronger
weight-poisoning attack method that introduces a layerwise weight poisoning
strategy to plant deeper backdoors; we also introduce a combinatorial trigger
that cannot be easily detected. The experiments on text classification tasks
show that previous defense methods cannot resist our weight-poisoning method,
which indicates that our method can be widely applied and may provide hints for
future model robustness studies.

foliage which makes it difficult for a robotic arm to grasp a lime without
coming in contact with leaves. Existing approaches either do not consider
leaves, or treat them as obstacles and completely avoid them, often resulting
in undesirable or infeasible plans. We focus on reaching a lime in the presence
of dense foliage by considering the leaves of a plant as 'permeable obstacles'
with a collision cost. We then adapt the rapidly exploring random tree star
(RRT*) algorithm for the problem of fruit harvesting by incorporating the cost
of collision with leaves into the path cost. To reduce the time required for
finding low-cost paths to goal, we bias the growth of the tree using an
artificial potential field (APF). We compare our proposed method with prior
work in a 2-D environment and a 6-DOF robot simulation. Our experiments and a
real-world demonstration on a robotic lime picking task demonstrate the

  media",,,"10.1038/s41566-022-01023-w",,"physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Optical aberrations have been studied for centuries, placing fundamental
limits on the achievable resolution in focusing and imaging. In the context of
structured light, the spatial pattern is distorted in amplitude and phase,
often arising from optical imperfections, element misalignment, or even from
dynamic processes due to propagation through perturbing media such as living
tissue, free-space, underwater and optical fibre. Here we show that the
polarisation inhomogeneity that defines vectorial structured light is immune to
all such perturbations, provided they are unitary. By way of example, we study
the robustness of vector vortex beams to tilted lenses and atmospheric
turbulence, both highly asymmetric aberrations, demonstrating that the
inhomogeneous nature of the polarisation remains unaltered from the near-field
to far-field, even as the structure itself changes. The unitary nature of the
channel allows us to undo this change through a simple lossless operation,
tailoring light that appears robust in all its spatial structure regardless of
the medium. Our insight highlights the overlooked role of measurement in
describing classical vectorial light fields, in doing so resolving prior
contradictory reports on the robustness of vector beams in complex media. This
paves the way to the versatile application of vectorial structured light, even
through non-ideal optical systems, crucial in applications such as imaging deep
into tissue and optical communication across noisy channels.

gradient descent techniques to search for optimal detector designs. We provide
a proof of principle for this technique by searching 1D detectors varying the
bulk properties of the detector until the optimal detector design is obtained.
Remarkably, we find the detector is capable of out-performing a human designed
experiment on which the search was initiated. This opens the door to further
gradient descent searches of more complex 2D and 3D designs across a wider
variety of materials and boundary geometries of the detector. There is also an
opportunity to use more sophisticated gradient descent algorithms to complete a

one-dimensional zig-zag ladder system of such spin-orbit coupled Rydberg atoms
at half filling. The second-order hopping is shown to be associated with an
effective gauge field, which in mean-field approximation is static and
homogeneous. Beyond the mean-field level the gauge potential attains a
transverse quantum component whose amplitude is dynamical and linked to density
modulations. We here study the effects of this to the possible ground-state
phases of the system. In a phase where strong repulsion leads to a density
wave, we find that as a consequence of the induced quantum gauge field a
regular pattern of current vortices is formed. However also in the absence of
density-density interactions the quantum gauge field attains a non-vanishing
amplitude. Above a certain critical strength of the second-order hopping the
energy gain due to gauge-field induced transport overcomes the energy cost from
the associated build-up of density modulations leading to a spontaneous

original Hamiltonian and inspired by the Lie-Schwinger procedure. To control
the ranges and supports of the effective potentials generated in the course of
our block-diagonalization steps, we use methods introduced in [DFPR3] for
Hamiltonians with bounded interactions potentials. However, due to the
unboundedness of the interaction potentails, weighted operator norms must be
introduced, and some of the steps of the inductive proof by which we control
the weighted norms of the effective potentials require special care to cope
with matrix elements of unbounded operators. We stress that no large-field
problems appear in our construction. In this respect our operator methods turn
out to be an efficient tool to separate the low-energy spectral region of the
Hamiltonian from other spectral regions, where the unbounded nature of the
interaction potentials would become manifest.

encoder and a decoder, which provide a straightforward way to map n-dimensional
data in input space to a lower m-dimensional representation space and back. The
decoder itself defines an m-dimensional manifold in input space. Inspired by
manifold learning, we show that the decoder can be trained on its own by
learning the representations of the training samples along with the decoder
weights using gradient descent. A sum-of-squares loss then corresponds to
optimizing the manifold to have the smallest Euclidean distance to the training
samples, and similarly for other loss functions. We derive expressions for the
number of samples needed to specify the encoder and decoder and show that the
decoder generally requires much less training samples to be well-specified
compared to the encoder. We discuss training of autoencoders in this
perspective and relate to previous work in the field that use noisy training
examples and other types of regularization. On the natural image data sets
MNIST and CIFAR10, we demonstrate that the decoder is much better suited to
learn a low-dimensional representation, especially when trained on small data
sets. Using simulated gene regulatory data, we further show that the decoder
alone leads to better generalization and meaningful representations. Our
approach of training the decoder alone facilitates representation learning even
on small data sets and can lead to improved training of autoencoders. We hope
that the simple analyses presented will also contribute to an improved
conceptual understanding of representation learning.

future behavior of the controlled system. For this purpose, digital twins of
the building can be used. However, with current methods in existing buildings,
a digital twin set up is usually labor-intensive. Especially connecting the
different components of the technical system to an overall digital twin of the
building is time-consuming. Piping and instrument diagrams (P&ID) can provide
the needed information, but it is necessary to extract the information and
provide it in a standardized format to process it further.
  In this work, we present an approach to recognize symbols and connections of
P&ID from buildings in a completely automated way. There are various standards
for graphical representation of symbols in P&ID of building energy systems.
Therefore, we use different data sources and standards to generate a holistic
training data set. We apply algorithms for symbol recognition, line recognition
and derivation of connections to the data sets. Furthermore, the result is
exported to a format that provides semantics of building energy systems.
  The symbol recognition, line recognition and connection recognition show good
results with an average precision of 93.7%, which can be used in further
processes like control generation, (distributed) model predictive control or
fault detection. Nevertheless, the approach needs further research.

raised questions about its trustworthiness in security-critical environments.
Part of the quest for trustworthy ML is robustness evaluation of ML models to
test-time adversarial examples. Inline with the trustworthy ML goal, a useful
input to potentially aid robustness evaluation is feature-based explanations of
model predictions. In this paper, we present a novel approach called EG-Booster
that leverages techniques from explainable ML to guide adversarial example
crafting for improved robustness evaluation of ML models before deploying them
in security-critical settings. The key insight in EG-Booster is the use of
feature-based explanations of model predictions to guide adversarial example
crafting by adding consequential perturbations likely to result in model
evasion and avoiding non-consequential ones unlikely to contribute to evasion.
EG-Booster is agnostic to model architecture, threat model, and supports
diverse distance metrics used previously in the literature. We evaluate
EG-Booster using image classification benchmark datasets, MNIST and CIFAR10.
Our findings suggest that EG-Booster significantly improves evasion rate of
state-of-the-art attacks while performing less number of perturbations. Through
extensive experiments that covers four white-box and three black-box attacks,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of EG-Booster against two undefended neural
networks trained on MNIST and CIFAR10, and another adversarially-trained ResNet

proportional to the common interface area. Therefore alterations across the
interface will lead to changes on the behavior of entanglement entropy. In this
work, the effects of bond defects at the boundaries of Kitaev ladders are
considered. We find a logarithmic scaling for the ground state entanglement
entropy between the two pieces. The prefactor of the logarithm (effective
central charge) varies continuously with the defect strength. The energy
dispersion is also obtained and sharp features in the von Neumann entanglement
entropy are observed when bands cross. Phase diagrams for homogeneous Kitaev
hamiltonians with nonzero superconducting paring potential are presented. They
show that for chains/legs that are connected to one another through inter-leg
hopping, when certain parameters are fine-tuned, the phase transition lines
correspond to either single or double gapless modes dispersion. Moreover, even
when the defect is turned on, the effective central charge for ladders with two
gapless modes is exactly twice the one for ladders with a single gapless mode.
On the other hand, in the absence of superconductivity, we can tune the
parameters to obtain homogeneous systems whose number of gapless modes is up to
the number of legs of the ladder. Additionally, in this situation, the presence
of the bond defect makes the effective central charge becomes smaller than the
number of gapless modes times the effective central charge of hamiltonians with
one gapless mode. Furthermore, the relationship between the cases with and
without superconductivity is presented.

it has been established that in the absence of a good fit, such regression

observation that control units not contributing to the construction of an SC

which allows for binary and count outcomes that are understudied in the SC
literature. We illustrate with simulation studies and an application to

curves can be characterized by a smooth single-peaked component coupled with a
more complex emission structure that is temporally-symmetric around the time of
the pulse peak. The model successfully fits 86% of BATSE GRB pulses bright
enough for structure properties to be measured. Surprisingly, a GRB pulse's
light curve morphology can be accurately predicted by the pulse asymmetry and
the stretching/compression needed to align the structural components preceding
the temporal mirror with the time-reversed components following it. Such a
prediction is only possible because GRB pulses exhibit temporal symmetry.
Time-asymmetric pulses include FREDs, rollercoaster pulses, and asymmetric
u-pulses, while time-symmetric pulses include u-pulses and crowns. Each
morphological type is characterized by specific asymmetries, stretching
parameters, durations, and alignments between the smooth and structured
components, and a delineation in the asymmetry/stretching distribution suggests
that symmetric pulses and asymmetric pulses may belong to separate populations.
Furthermore, pulses belonging to the short GRB class exhibit similar
morphologies to the long GRB class, but appear to simply occur on shorter
timescales.

attractive solution while lifting or dropping payloads during emergency
evacuations, construction works, etc. During such operations, dynamic
variations in (possibly unknown) payload cause considerable changes in the
system dynamics. However, a systematic control solution to tackle such varying
dynamical behaviour is still missing. In this work, two control solutions are
proposed to solve two specific problems in aerial transportation of payload, as
mentioned below. In the first work, we explore the tracking control problem for
a six degrees-of-freedom quadrotor carrying different unknown payloads. Due to
the state-dependent nature of the uncertainties caused by variation in the
dynamics, the state-of-the-art adaptive control solutions would be ineffective
against these uncertainties that can be completely unknown and possibly
unbounded a priori. In addition, external disturbances such as wind while
following a trajectory in all three positions and attitude angles. Hence, an
adaptive control solution for quadrotors is proposed, which does not require
any a priori knowledge of the parameters of quadrotor dynamics and external
disturbances. The second work is focused on the interchanging dynamic behaviour
of a quadrotor while loading and unloading different payloads during vertical
operations. The control problem to maintain the desired altitude is formulated
via a switched dynamical framework to capture the interchanging dynamics of the
quadrotor during such vertical operations, and a robust adaptive control
solution is proposed to tackle such dynamics when it is unknown. The stability
of the closed-loop system is studied analytically and the effectiveness of the
proposed solution is verified via simulations.

non-singular bounce, and after the bounce, it decelerates having a matter-like
dominated evolution during some regime of the deceleration era, and finally at
the present epoch it evolves through an accelerating stage. Our aim is to study
such evolution in the context of Chern-Simons corrected F(R) gravity theory and
confront the model with various observational data. Using the reconstruction
technique, and in addition by employing suitable boundary conditions, we
determine the form of F(R) for the entire possible range of the cosmic time.
The form of F(R) seems to unify a non-singular bounce with a dark energy epoch,
in particular, from a non-singular bounce to a deceleration epoch and from a
deceleration epoch to a late time acceleration era. It is important to mention
that the bouncing scenario in the present context is an asymmetric bounce, in
particular, the Hubble radius monotonically increases and asymptotically
diverges at the late contracting era, while it seems to decrease with time at
the present epoch. Such evolution of the Hubble radius leads to the primordial
perturbation modes generate at the deep contracting era when all the
perturbation modes lie within the horizon. We calculate the scalar and tensor
power spectra, and as a result, the primordial observables are found to be in
agreement with the latest Planck 2018 constraints. In this regard, the
Chern-Simons term seems to have considerable effects on the tensor perturbation
evolution, however keeping intact the scalar part of the perturbation with that
of in the case of a vacuum F(R) model, and as a result, the Chern-Simons term
proves to play an important role in making the observable quantities consistent

relativity can be described using a formalism known as gravitoelectromagnetism.
In this formalism a vector potential, the gravitomagnetic potential, arises as
a result of moving masses, in strong analogy with the magnetic force due to
moving charges in Maxwell's theory. Gravitomagnetism can affect orbits in the
gravitational field of a massive, rotating body. This raises the possibility
that gravitomagnetism may serve as the dominant physics behind the anomalous
rotation curves of spiral galaxies, eliminating the need for dark matter. In
this essay, we methodically work out the magnitude of the gravitomagnetic

the MIT Bag model equation of state applicable to hadronic matter, anisotropy
is introduced via the superposition of the seed source and the decoupled

bifurcates into two distinct models, namely the mimicking of the $\theta$
sector to the seed radial pressure and energy density and a regular fluid
model. Each of these models can be interpreted as self-gravitating static,
compact objects with the exterior described by the vacuum Boulware-Deser

J1614-2230, PSR J1903+317, and LMC X-4 we subject our solutions to rigorous
viability tests based on regularity and stability. We find that the
Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet parameter and the decoupling constant compete against
each other for ensuring physically realizable stellar structures. The novel
feature of work is the demonstration of stable compact objects with stellar

struggles in the low-resource scenarios with limited training data. Existing
dominant approaches usually suffer from the challenge that the target domain
has different label sets compared with a resource-rich source domain, which can
be concluded as class transfer and domain transfer. In this paper, we propose a
lightweight tuning paradigm for low-resource NER via pluggable prompting
(LightNER). Specifically, we construct the unified learnable verbalizer of
entity categories to generate the entity span sequence and entity categories
without any label-specific classifiers, thus addressing the class transfer
issue. We further propose a pluggable guidance module by incorporating
learnable parameters into the self-attention layer as guidance, which can
re-modulate the attention and adapt pre-trained weights. Note that we only tune
those inserted module with the whole parameter of the pre-trained language
model fixed, thus, making our approach lightweight and flexible for
low-resource scenarios and can better transfer knowledge across domains.
Experimental results show that LightNER can obtain comparable performance in
the standard supervised setting and outperform strong baselines in low-resource
settings. Code is in

antecedents and consequents firstly, in terms of probabilistic constraints on
conditional events (in the sense of defaults, or negated defaults) and
secondly, in terms of constraints on compounds of conditionals and iterated
conditionals. After developing different notions of negations and notions of

  calculus",,,,,"math.NA cs.CE cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  This article discusses a mixed FE technique for 3D nonlinear elasticity using
a Hu-Washizu (HW) type variational principle. Here, the deformed configuration
and sections from its cotangent bundle are taken as additional input arguments.
The critical points of the HW functional enforce compatibility of these
sections with the configuration, in addition to mechanical equilibrium and
constitutive relations. The present FE approximation distinguishes a vector
from a 1-from, a feature not commonly found in FE approximations. This point of
view permits us to construct finite elements with vastly superior performance.
Discrete approximations for the differential forms appearing in the variational
principle are constructed with ideas borrowed from finite element exterior
calculus. The discrete equations describing mechanical equilibrium,
compatibility and constitutive rule, are obtained by extemizing the discrete
functional with respect to appropriate DoF, which are then solved using the
Newton's method. This mixed FE technique is then applied to benchmark problems
wherein conventional displacement based approximations encounter locking and
checker boarding.

dynamics in GaAs semiconductor photocathodes. Gradient doping is incorporated
in the model through the inclusion of directional carrier drift. The
time-evolution of electron concentration in the active layer upon the injection
of an excitation pulse is solved both numerically and analytically. The
predictions of the model are compared with experiments via carrier-induced
transient reflectivity change, which is measured for gradient-doped and
uniform-doped photocathodes using femtosecond pump-probe reflectometry.
Excellent agreement is found between the experiments and the theory, leading to
the characterization of key device parameters such as diffusion constant and
electron decay rates. Comparisons are also made between uniform doping and
gradient doping for their characteristics in photoelectron transportation.
Doping gradient is found to be able to accelerate electron accumulation on the
device surface. These results offer new insights into the dynamics of III-V
photocathodes and potentially open a new avenue toward experimental

Fairness is measured by how close different nodes are to influencers in the
network. To allow for easy comparison of fairness across graphs of different
sizes, our fairness measure is normalized to the same measure on a synthetic
power-law graph of the same size. We experimented with the Erdos-Renyi and
Barabasi-Albert graphs and found the latter to be more robust in terms of
normalization. In addition to developing a new fairness measure, we propose a
new node recommendation algorithm to increase fairness in networks. Our
algorithm works by recommending a target node based on the number of triangles
between the source and target node with probability P, and with probability
1-P, it introduces weak ties and diversity in the network by recommending nodes
using an importance sampling algorithm. This sampling algorithm is based on a
polynomial function of the degree of the target node and its distance from the
influencer set. Through extensive simulations on three real-world network data
sets and comparing seven different algorithms, we show that the algorithm which
recommends target nodes with probability proportional to the square of the
ratio of the degree of the target node to distance to influencer achieves the
best fairness. We show the robustness of the algorithm to different parameter
choices and provide insights on when to use the different importance sampling
methods based on the structure of the network. We also provide a generalization
of our method for disconnected graphs.

beyond the spherical assumption, we develop an algorithm that exploits a fully
spectral description of the magnetic field in triaxial ellipsoids to solve the
induction equation with local boundary conditions (i.e. pseudo-vacuum or
perfectly conducting boundaries). We use the method to compute the free-decay
magnetic modes and to solve the kinematic dynamo problem for prescribed flows.
The new method is thoroughly compared with analytical solutions and standard
finite-element computations, which are also used to model an insulating
exterior. We obtain dynamo magnetic fields at low magnetic Reynolds numbers in
ellipsoids, which could be used as simple benchmarks for future dynamo studies
in such geometries. We finally discuss how the magnetic boundary conditions can
modify the dynamo onset, showing that a perfectly conducting boundary can
strongly weaken dynamo action, whereas pseudo-vacuum and insulating boundaries

However, collection of such data, require shutting down equipment for

operational data usually collected every 10 minutes, comprised of wind speed,

monitoring health of wind turbine components such as blades, gearbox and

a computational approach we call meta-brain models. Meta-brain models are
embodied hybrid models that include layered components featuring varying
degrees of representational complexity. We will propose combinations of layers
composed using specialized types of models. Rather than using a generic black
box approach to unify each component, this relationship mimics systems like the
neocortical-thalamic system relationship of the mammalian brain, which utilizes
both feedforward and feedback connectivity to facilitate functional
communication. Importantly, the relationship between layers can be made
anatomically explicit. This allows for structural specificity that can be
incorporated into the model's function in interesting ways. We will propose
several types of layers that might be functionally integrated into agents that
perform unique types of tasks, from agents that simultaneously perform
morphogenesis and perception, to agents that undergo morphogenesis and the
acquisition of conceptual representations simultaneously. Our approach to
meta-brain models involves creating models with different degrees of
representational complexity, creating a layered meta-architecture that mimics
the structural and functional heterogeneity of biological brains, and an
input/output methodology flexible enough to accommodate cognitive functions,
social interactions, and adaptive behaviors more generally. We will conclude by
proposing next steps in the development of this flexible and open-source
