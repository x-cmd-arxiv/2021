  Reconstruction","Early accepted by MICCAI-2021",,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  3D ultrasound (US) is widely used for its rich diagnostic information.
However, it is criticized for its limited field of view. 3D freehand US
reconstruction is promising in addressing the problem by providing broad range
and freeform scan. The existing deep learning based methods only focus on the
basic cases of skill sequences, and the model relies on the training data
heavily. The sequences in real clinical practice are a mix of diverse skills
and have complex scanning paths. Besides, deep models should adapt themselves
to the testing cases with prior knowledge for better robustness, rather than
only fit to the training cases. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to
sensorless freehand 3D US reconstruction considering the complex skill
sequences. Our contribution is three-fold. First, we advance a novel online
learning framework by designing a differentiable reconstruction algorithm. It
realizes an end-to-end optimization from section sequences to the reconstructed
volume. Second, a self-supervised learning method is developed to explore the
context information that reconstructed by the testing data itself, promoting
the perception of the model. Third, inspired by the effectiveness of shape
prior, we also introduce adversarial training to strengthen the learning of
anatomical shape prior in the reconstructed volume. By mining the context and
structural cues of the testing data, our online learning methods can drive the
model to handle complex skill sequences. Experimental results on developmental
dysplasia of the hip US and fetal US datasets show that, our proposed method
can outperform the start-of-the-art methods regarding the shift errors and path
similarities.

calculations of a central processor, but in the brain neurons and synapses
self-adjust based on local information. Contrastive learning algorithms have
recently been proposed to train physical systems, such as fluidic, mechanical,
or electrical networks, to perform machine learning tasks from local evolution
rules. However, to date such systems have only been implemented in silico due
to the engineering challenge of creating elements that autonomously evolve
based on their own response to two sets of global boundary conditions. Here we
introduce and implement a physics-driven contrastive learning scheme for a
network of variable resistors, using circuitry to locally compare the response
of two identical networks subjected to the two different sets of boundary
conditions. Using this innovation, our system effectively trains itself,
optimizing its resistance values without use of a central processor or external
information storage. Once the system is trained for a specified allostery,
regression, or classification task, the task is subsequently performed rapidly
and automatically by the physical imperative to minimize power dissipation in
response to the given voltage inputs. We demonstrate that, unlike typical
computers, such learning systems are robust to extreme damage (and thus
manufacturing defects) due to their decentralized learning. Our twin-network
approach is therefore readily scalable to extremely large or nonlinear networks
where its distributed nature will be an enormous advantage; a laboratory
network of only 500 edges will already outpace its in silico counterpart.

learn a reward function or policy from expert demonstrations. Learning from
demonstration has been shown to be advantageous for navigation tasks as it
allows for machine learning non-experts to quickly provide information needed
to learn complex traversal behaviors. However, a minimal set of demonstrations
is unlikely to capture all relevant information needed to achieve the desired
behavior in every possible future operational environment. Due to
distributional shift among environments, a robot may encounter features that
were rarely or never observed during training for which the appropriate reward
value is uncertain, leading to undesired outcomes. This paper proposes a
Bayesian technique which quantifies uncertainty over the weights of a linear
reward function given a dataset of minimal human demonstrations to operate
safely in dynamic environments. This uncertainty is quantified and incorporated
into a risk averse set of weights used to generate cost maps for planning.
Experiments in a 3-D environment with a simulated robot show that our proposed
algorithm enables a robot to avoid dangerous terrain completely in two out of
three test scenarios and accumulates a lower amount of risk than related
approaches in all scenarios without requiring any additional demonstrations.

various isotopic chains that include the nuclei featuring the $N=50$ and $82$

correction term give an almost similar trend of nuclear size for some isotopic
chains with open proton shell, especially the abrupt increases across the
strong neutron closed shells and the OES behaviors. This reflects that the
$np$-SRCs have almost no influence for some nuclei due to the strong coupling
between different levels around Fermi surface. The weakening OES behavior of
nuclear charge radii is observed generally at completely filled neutron shells
and this may be proposed as a signature of magic indicator.

the adequacy of our approach for microarray data related to four types of
cancer, carrying out an extensive comparison with other ensemble and single FS
approaches. Five FS methods were used in our experiments: Wx, Symmetrical
Uncertainty (SU), Gain Ratio (GR), Characteristic Direction (GeoDE), and
ReliefF. We observed that the Hyb-EFS and Het-EFS approaches attenuated the

the specific characteristics of FSO systems including the non-uniformity and
possible misalignment of the laser beams. Furthermore, to compare the proposed

this model is applicable for both large and intermediate IRS-receiver lens

outperforms the other protocols, whereas in the presence of misalignment
errors, the IRSH protocol performs significantly better than the IRSD protocol.

three-dimensional (3D) magnetic reconnection of finite extent in the out of
plane direction. This theory addresses systems with or without an out of plane
(guide) magnetic field, and with or without Hall physics. The theory reproduces
known spreading speeds and directions with and without guide fields, unifying
previous knowledge in a single theory. New results include: (1) Reconnection
spreads in a particular direction if an x-line is induced at the interface
between reconnecting and non-reconnecting regions, which is controlled by the
out of plane gradient of the electric field in the outflow direction. (2) The
spreading mechanism for anti-parallel collisionless reconnection is convection,
as is known, but for guide field reconnection it is magnetic field bending. We
confirm the theory using 3D two-fluid and resistive-magnetohydrodynamics
simulations. (3) The theory explains why anti-parallel reconnection in
resistive-magnetohydrodynamics does not spread. (4) The simulation domain
aspect ratio, associated with the free magnetic energy, influences whether
reconnection spreads or convects with a fixed x-line length. (5) We perform a
simulation initiating anti-parallel collisionless reconnection with a pressure
pulse instead of a magnetic perturbation, finding spreading is unchanged rather
than spreading at the magnetosonic speed as previously suggested. The results
provide a theoretical framework for understanding spreading beyond systems
studied here, and are important for applications including two-ribbon solar
flares and reconnection in Earth's magnetosphere.

real-world problems, it has become crucial to uncover the hidden reasoning
behind their decisions by focusing on the fairness and auditing the predictions
made by these black-box models. In this paper, we propose a novel method to
address two key issues: (a) Can we simultaneously learn fair disentangled
representations while ensuring the utility of the learned representation for
downstream tasks, and (b)Can we provide theoretical insights into when the
proposed approach will be both fair and accurate. To address the former, we
propose the method FRIED, Fair Representation learning using Interpolation
Enabled Disentanglement. In our architecture, by imposing a critic-based
adversarial framework, we enforce the interpolated points in the latent space
to be more realistic. This helps in capturing the data manifold effectively and
enhances the utility of the learned representation for downstream prediction
tasks. We address the latter question by developing a theory on
fairness-accuracy trade-offs using classifier-based conditional mutual
information estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FRIED on datasets
of different modalities - tabular, text, and image datasets. We observe that
the representations learned by FRIED are overall fairer in comparison to
existing baselines and also accurate for downstream prediction tasks.
Additionally, we evaluate FRIED on a real-world healthcare claims dataset where
we conduct an expert aided model auditing study providing useful insights into

Theoretically, we propose the Conditional Kernel Bures (CKB) metric for

map. It provides an interpretable approach to understand the knowledge transfer

used our proposed neuron activity pattern (NAP) model to define an assorted
range of interactions and simulated across a 2D lattice with two-state
(firing/non-firing) neurons. We observed the emergence of scale-free,
hierarchically organized ordered patterns of active neurons, that we call as
functional cortical patterns (FCPs), only at the near-critical phase
transition. We have done extensive topological characterization of FCPs and
tested its congruency with the functional brain networks obtained from the
empirical electrophysiological data of a visual stimulus task. Our results of
network theory attributes, fractal analysis and functional cartography have
confirmed the transitioning effect while generation of FCPs. This gives us
strong implication that the functional neuronal system supports
far-from-equilibrium dynamics upon receiving a stimulus. Our investigation for
the long, critical and short-ranged interactions has lead to an interpretation
that near-critical transition phase is a spectrum of critical temperatures

range of interaction among neurons plays an important role in defining the
functional severity of the neuronal circuitry. We propose that interaction
range as a function of coupling strength drives connectivity in an augmenting

Level-Set-Method (SI-LSM) is proposed for both uniform and non-uniform
Cartesian-Grid. The AiMuR involves interface location based dynamic
un-refinement (with merging of the four control volumes) of the Cartesian grid
away from the interface. The un-refinement is proposed for the interface solver
only. A detailed numerical methodology is presented for the AiMuR and
ghost-fluid method based SI-LSM. Advantage of the novel as compared to the
traditional SI-LSM is demonstrated with a detailed qualitative as well as
quantitative performance study, involving the SI-LSMs on both coarse grid and
fine grid, for three sufficiently different two-phase flow problems: dam break,
breakup of a liquid jet and drop coalescence. A superior performance of AiMuR
based SI-LSM is demonstrated - the AiMuR on a coarser non-uniform grid
($NU_{c}^{AiMuR}$) is almost as accurate as the traditional SI-LSM on a uniform
fine grid ($U_{f}$) and takes a computational time almost same as that by the
traditional SI-LSM on a uniform coarse grid ($U_{c}$). The AMuR is different
from the existing Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) as the former involves only
mesh un-refinement while the later involves both refinement and un-refinement
of the mesh. Moreover, the proposed computational development is significant
since the present adaptive un-refinement strategy is much simpler to implement
as compared to that for the commonly used adaptive refinement strategies. The
proposed numerical development can be extended to various other multi-physics,
multi-disciplinary and multi-scale problems involving interfaces.

distributional assumptions, introduce spatial and temporal outliers, and reduce
the signal-to-noise ratio of the data -- all of which can have negative
consequences for downstream statistical analysis. Scrubbing is a technique for
excluding fMRI volumes thought to be contaminated by artifacts and generally
comes in two flavors. Motion scrubbing based on subject head motion-derived
measures is popular but suffers from a number of drawbacks, especially high
rates of censoring of individual volumes and entire subjects. Alternatively,
data-driven scrubbing methods like DVARS are based on observed noise in the
processed fMRI timeseries and may avoid some of these issues. Here we propose
""projection scrubbing"", a novel data-driven scrubbing method based on a
statistical outlier detection framework and strategic dimension reduction,
including independent component analysis (ICA), to isolate artifactual
variation. We undertake a comprehensive comparison of motion scrubbing with
data-driven projection scrubbing and DVARS.
  We argue that an appropriate metric for the success of scrubbing is maximal
data retention subject to reasonable performance on typical benchmarks of
functional connectivity. We find that stringent motion scrubbing yields
worsened validity, worsened reliability, and produced small improvements to
fingerprinting. Meanwhile, data-driven scrubbing methods tend to yield greater
improvements to fingerprinting while not generally worsening validity or
reliability. Importantly, however, data-driven scrubbing excludes a fraction of
the number of volumes or entire sessions compared to motion scrubbing. The
ability of data-driven fMRI scrubbing to improve data retention without
negatively impacting the quality of downstream analysis has major implications
for sample sizes in population neuroscience research.

Saturn's northern hexagon changed from dark blue/green to a moderately brighter
gold color, except for the inner eye region (88.2 deg - 90 deg N), which
remained relatively unchanged. These and even more dramatic near-IR changes can
be reproduced by an aerosol model of four compact layers consisting of a
stratospheric haze at an effective pressure near 50 mbar, a deeper haze of
putative diphosphine particles typically near 300 mbar, an ammonia cloud layer
with a base pressure between 0.4 bar and 1.3 bar, and a deeper cloud of a
possible mix of NH4SH and water ice particles within the 2.7 to 4.5 bar region.
Our analysis of the background clouds between the discrete features shows that
between 2013 and 2016 the effective pressures of most layers changed very
little, except for the ammonia ice layer, which decreased from about 1 bar to
0.4 bar near the edge of the eye, but increased to 1 bar inside the eye. Inside
the hexagon there were large increases in optical depth, by up to a factor of
10 near the eye for the putative diphosphine layer and by a factor of four over
most of the hexagon interior. Inside the eye, aerosol optical depths were very
low, suggesting downwelling motions. The high contrast between eye and
surroundings in 2016 was due to substantial increases in optical depths outside
the eye. The color change from blue/green to gold inside most of the hexagon
region can be explained in our model almost entirely by changes in the
stratospheric haze, which increased between 2013 and 2016 by a factor of four
in optical depth and by almost a factor of three in the short-wavelength peak
imaginary index.

characterized by larger background contributions compared to fully leptonic

through the use of jet substructure. We show that with these techniques

learning applications including meta-learning, hyperparameter optimization, and
network architecture search. There are generally two classes of bilevel
optimization formulations for machine learning: 1) problem-based bilevel
optimization, whose inner-level problem is formulated as finding a minimizer of
a given loss function; and 2) algorithm-based bilevel optimization, whose
inner-level solution is an output of a fixed algorithm. For the first class,
two popular types of gradient-based algorithms have been proposed for
hypergradient estimation via approximate implicit differentiation (AID) and
iterative differentiation (ITD). Algorithms for the second class include the
popular model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) and almost no inner loop (ANIL).
However, the convergence rate and fundamental limitations of bilevel
optimization algorithms have not been well explored.
  This thesis provides a comprehensive convergence rate analysis for bilevel
algorithms in the aforementioned two classes. We further propose principled
algorithm designs for bilevel optimization with higher efficiency and
scalability. For the problem-based formulation, we provide a convergence rate
analysis for AID- and ITD-based bilevel algorithms. We then develop
acceleration bilevel algorithms, for which we provide shaper convergence
analysis with relaxed assumptions. We also provide the first lower bounds for
bilevel optimization, and establish the optimality by providing matching upper
bounds under certain conditions. We finally propose new stochastic bilevel
optimization algorithms with lower complexity and higher efficiency in
practice. For the algorithm-based formulation, we develop a theoretical
convergence for general multi-step MAML and ANIL, and characterize the impact
of parameter selections and loss geometries on the their complexities.

Convex Optimization (DP-SCO) and provide excess population risks for some
special classes of functions that are faster than the previous results of
general convex and strongly convex functions. In the first part of the paper,
we study the case where the population risk function satisfies the Tysbakov
Noise Condition (TNC) with some parameter $\theta>1$. Specifically, we first
show that under some mild assumptions on the loss functions, there is an
algorithm whose output could achieve an upper bound of
$\tilde{O}((\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+\frac{\sqrt{d\log
\frac{1}{\delta}}}{n\epsilon})^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1})$ for $(\epsilon,
\delta)$-DP when $\theta\geq 2$, here $n$ is the sample size and $d$ is the
dimension of the space. Then we address the inefficiency issue, improve the
upper bounds by $\text{Poly}(\log n)$ factors and extend to the case where
$\theta\geq \bar{\theta}>1$ for some known $\bar{\theta}$. Next we show that
the excess population risk of population functions satisfying TNC with
parameter $\theta\geq 2$ is always lower bounded by
$\Omega((\frac{d}{n\epsilon})^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}) $ and
$\Omega((\frac{\sqrt{d\log
\frac{1}{\delta}}}{n\epsilon})^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1})$ for $\epsilon$-DP and
$(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP, respectively. In the second part, we focus on a
special case where the population risk function is strongly convex. Unlike the
previous studies, here we assume the loss function is {\em non-negative} and
{\em the optimal value of population risk is sufficiently small}. With these
additional assumptions, we propose a new method whose output could achieve an
upper bound of
$O(\frac{d\log\frac{1}{\delta}}{n^2\epsilon^2}+\frac{1}{n^{\tau}})$ for any
$\tau\geq 1$ in $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP model if the sample size $n$ is
sufficiently large.

Networks (DNNs). But, how robust are they? Although it has been well-known that
DNNs often suffer from adversarial vulnerability with a catastrophic drop in
performance, the situation is even worse in stereo matching. This paper first
shows that a type of weak white-box attacks can overwhelm state-of-the-art
methods. The attack is learned by a proposed stereo-constrained projected
gradient descent (PGD) method in stereo matching. This observation raises
serious concerns for the deployment of DNN-based stereo matching. Parallel to
the adversarial vulnerability, DNN-based stereo matching is typically trained
under the so-called simulation to reality pipeline, and thus domain
generalizability is an important problem. This paper proposes to rethink the
learnable DNN-based feature backbone towards adversarially-robust and domain
generalizable stereo matching by completely removing it for matching. In
experiments, the proposed method is tested in the SceneFlow dataset and the
KITTI2015 benchmark, with promising results. We compute the matching cost
volume using the classic multi-scale census transform (i.e., local binary
pattern) of the raw input stereo images, followed by a stacked Hourglass head
sub-network solving the matching problem. It significantly improves the
adversarial robustness, while retaining accuracy performance comparable to
state-of-the-art methods. It also shows better generalizability from simulation
(SceneFlow) to real (KITTI) datasets when no fine-tuning is used.

limited data (few-shot classification). The task becomes even more challenging
if it is also required to identify samples from unknown categories (open-set
classification). Learning a good abstraction for a class with very few samples
is extremely difficult, especially under open-set settings. As a result,
open-set recognition has received minimal attention in the few-shot setting.
However, it is a critical task in many applications like environmental
monitoring, where the number of labeled examples for each class is limited.
Existing few-shot open-set recognition (FSOSR) methods rely on thresholding
schemes, with some considering uniform probability for open-class samples.
However, this approach is often inaccurate, especially for fine-grained
categorization, and makes them highly sensitive to the choice of a threshold.
To address these concerns, we propose Reconstructing Exemplar-based Few-shot
Open-set ClaSsifier (ReFOCS). By using a novel exemplar reconstruction-based
meta-learning strategy ReFOCS streamlines FSOSR eliminating the need for a
carefully tuned threshold by learning to be self-aware of the openness of a

quench from the high-temperature coil phase to a low-temperature state point,
we study the coarsening kinetics via molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using
the Langevin thermostat. For the passive polymer case the low-temperature
equilibrium state is a compact globule. Results from our MD simulations reveal
that though the globular state is also the typical final state in the active
case, the nonequilibrium pathways to arrive at such a state differ from the
passive picture due to the alignment interaction among the beads. We notice
that deviations from the intermediate ""pearl-necklace""-like arrangement, that
is observed in the passive case, and the formation of more elongated
dumbbell-like structures increase with increasing activity. Furthermore, it
appears that while a small active force on the beads certainly makes the
coarsening process much faster, there exists nonmonotonic dependence of the
collapse time on the strength of active interaction. We quantify these
observations by comparing the scaling laws for the collapse time and growth of

maximize expected pay-off (risk-neutral approaches) or improve worst-case or
near-worst-case outcomes (risk-averse approaches). Within the context of our
problem, we demonstrate the inherent limitations of unilaterally ignoring or
avoiding risk and show that these approaches can in fact reduce the probability
of satisfying task requirements. Inspired by models that explain foraging
behaviors in animals, we develop a risk-adaptive approach to task allocation.
Our approach adaptively switches between risk-averse and risk-seeking behavior
in order to maximize the probability of satisfying task requirements.
Comprehensive numerical experiments conclusively demonstrate that our

also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using a simulated

numerical setting may lead to problematic configurations in which, for
instance, volumes occupied by distinct bodies may overlap. Such situations
lying beyond the range of admissible configurations for constraint-based
methods, their occurrence typically results in non-meaningful simulation
outcomes. We propose a method which acknowledges the possibility of such
occurrences while demoting their occurrence. This is pursued through the use of
a penalty-based approach, and draws on notions of mechanical impedance to infer
apposite reaction forces. Results of numerical simulations illustrate efficacy

and a Be star with a circumstellar disk, might be the source of a repeating FRB
with periodic activities, and apply this model to explain the activity window
of FRB 180916B. The interaction between the NS magnetosphere and the accreted
material results in evolution of the spin period and the centrifugal force of
the NS, leading to the change of the stress in the NS crust. When the stress of
the crust reaches the critical value, a starquake occurs and further produces
FRBs. The interval between starquakes is estimated to be a few days that is
smaller than the active window of FRB 180916B. When the NS moves out of the
disk of the Be star, the interval between starquakes becomes much longer than
the orbital period, which corresponds to the non-active phase. In this model,
due to the absorption of the disk of the Be star, a frequency-dependent active
window would appear for the FRBs, which is consistent with the observed
properties of FRB 180916B. And the contribution of dispersion measure (DM) from
the disk of the Be star is small. In addition, the location of FRB 180916B in
the host galaxy is consistent with a BeXRB system.

diversity in any existing dataset. Experimental results show that we are among
the state-of-the-art on the 3DPW and 3DPW-Crowd datasets in terms of pose

downstream classifiers for many downstream tasks with a small amount of or no

attack to self-supervised learning. In particular, our BadEncoder injects
backdoors into a pre-trained image encoder such that the downstream classifiers
built based on the backdoored image encoder for different downstream tasks
simultaneously inherit the backdoor behavior. We formulate our BadEncoder as an
optimization problem and we propose a gradient descent based method to solve
it, which produces a backdoored image encoder from a clean one. Our extensive
empirical evaluation results on multiple datasets show that our BadEncoder
achieves high attack success rates while preserving the accuracy of the

results show that these defenses are insufficient to defend against BadEncoder,
highlighting the needs for new defenses against our BadEncoder. Our code is

along the planned trajectory. We aim to minimize the total energy consumption
of the UAV-WSN system in a complete round of data collection. Toward this end,
we formulate the energy consumption minimization problem as a constrained
combinatorial optimization problem by jointly selecting CHs from nodes within
clusters and planning the UAV's visiting order to the selected CHs. The
formulated energy consumption minimization problem is NP-hard, and hence, hard
to solve optimally. In order to tackle this challenge, we propose a novel deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) technique, pointer network-A* (Ptr-A*), which can
efficiently learn from experiences the UAV trajectory policy for minimizing the
energy consumption. The UAV's start point and the WSN with a set of
pre-determined clusters are fed into the Ptr-A*, and the Ptr-A* outputs a group
of CHs and the visiting order to these CHs, i.e., the UAV's trajectory. The
parameters of the Ptr-A* are trained on small-scale clusters problem instances
for faster training by using the actor-critic algorithm in an unsupervised

quality of solutions. Simulation results show that the trained models based on
20-clusters and 40-clusters have a good generalization ability to solve the

experimental studies of intracellular condensates (drops with condensed

the coarsening rates observed are unexpectedly slow for many intracellular

that the slow coarsening rate can be caused by the slow conversion of a

theories of coarsening in phase separation (Lifshitz-Slyozov--Wagner Ostwald
ripening and drop coalescence schemes) no longer apply. Surprisingly, I show
here that the model equations of conversion-limited phase separation can
instead be mapped onto a grain growth model in a single-phase material in three

EDM; the muon $g-2$ can also interplay with electron EDM assuming the

the relevant CP-phases in the MSSM.
  In this work, we first use such an interplay to derive an approximate
analytical upper limit on the relevant CP-phase. Then we extensively scan the
parameter space to obtain more accurate upper limits. We obtain the following
observations:
  (i) The muon $g-2$ in the $2\sigma$ range combined with the electron EDM

guarantee. In CMFL, a committee system is set up to screen the uploaded local
gradients. The committee system selects the local gradients rated by the
elected members for the aggregation procedure through the selection strategy,
and replaces the committee member through the election strategy. Based on the
different considerations of model performance and defense, two opposite
selection strategies are designed for the sake of both accuracy and robustness.
Extensive experiments illustrate that CMFL achieves faster convergence and
better accuracy than the typical Federated Learning, in the meanwhile obtaining
better robustness than the traditional Byzantine-tolerant algorithms, in the
manner of a decentralized approach. In addition, we theoretically analyze and
prove the convergence of CMFL under different election and selection
strategies, which coincides with the experimental results.

light classification in instances of complete loss of direct observation. By
taking into account observations of vehicular behavior from multiple directions

address some of the major challenges in 5th Generation (5G) Wireless

where NOMA schemes are integrated with millimeter wave (mmWave) massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. An accurate estimation of the
channel is essential in exploiting the benefits of the pairing of the duo-NOMA

approach to estimate the channel for NOMA based millimeter wave (mmWave)
massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems built on a hybrid
architecture. Initially, users are grouped into different clusters based on
their channel gains and beamforming technique is performed to maximize the
signal in the direction of desired cluster. A coarse estimation of the channel
is first made from the received signal and this estimate is given as the input
to CNN to fine estimate the channel coefficients. Numerical illustrations show
that the proposed method outperforms least square (LS) estimate, minimum mean

dynamic brain states which are thought to underlie the drug's pharmacological
effects. Despite the elucidation regarding the mechanisms of action at the
molecular level, the manner how propofol acts on neural circuits leading to
unconsciousness is still unclear. To identify possible mechanisms, the
spatial-temporal patterns of functional connectivity established among cortical
areas need to be described. The present research was based on the analysis of
sub-dural ECoG records from macaques under anesthetic induction experiments.
Granger causality in the frequency domain was used to infer functional
interactions in five physiological frequency bands serially at every five
seconds throughout the experiment. These time-resolved functional networks
permitted to observe the unfolding of the anesthetic induction and compare
networks respective to distinct conditions. Within about one minute after
propofol administration, functional connectivity started to gradually increase
for about 4-5 minutes, then began to decrease until the LOC was achieved.
During the transition, it was also evidenced a predominant Granger causality
flow parting from occipital and temporal areas to frontal and parietal regions.
During general anesthesia the local connectivity of the occipital lobe raised,
and also did the interactions, established among the occipital and temporal
lobes. Functional interactions parting from frontal and parietal lobes to
temporal and occipital areas had been mainly compromised. The research brings a
detailed description of the propofol effects on large-scale cortical functional
connectivity along with the anesthetic induction in non-human primates, and it
is one of the first studies to describe the dynamics of functional connectivity
during the transitional state that precedes LOC.

mortality rate. The diagnosis of MVI needs discovering the vessels that contain
hepatocellular carcinoma cells and counting their number in each vessel, which
depends heavily on experiences of the doctor, is largely subjective and
time-consuming. However, there is no algorithm as yet tailored for the MVI
detection from pathological images. This paper collects the first pathological
liver image dataset containing 522 whole slide images with labels of vessels,
MVI, and hepatocellular carcinoma grades. The first and essential step for the
automatic diagnosis of MVI is the accurate segmentation of vessels. The unique
characteristics of pathological liver images, such as super-large size,
multi-scale vessel, and blurred vessel edges, make the accurate vessel
segmentation challenging. Based on the collected dataset, we propose an
Edge-competing Vessel Segmentation Network (EVS-Net), which contains a
segmentation network and two edge segmentation discriminators. The segmentation
network, combined with an edge-aware self-supervision mechanism, is devised to
conduct vessel segmentation with limited labeled patches. Meanwhile, two
discriminators are introduced to distinguish whether the segmented vessel and
background contain residual features in an adversarial manner. In the training
stage, two discriminators are devised tocompete for the predicted position of
edges. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that, with only limited labeled
patches, EVS-Net achieves a close performance of fully supervised methods,
which provides a convenient tool for the pathological liver vessel
segmentation. Code is publicly available at

challenging. In a dual-arm manipulation setup, the increased number of state
dimensions caused by the additional robot manipulators causes distractions and
results in poor performance of the neural networks. We address this issue using
a self-attention mechanism that computes dependencies between elements in a
sequential input and focuses on important elements. A Transformer, a variant of
self-attention architecture, is applied to deep imitation learning to solve
dual-arm manipulation tasks in the real world. The proposed method has been
tested on dual-arm manipulation tasks using a real robot. The experimental
results demonstrated that the Transformer-based deep imitation learning
architecture can attend to the important features among the sensory inputs,
therefore reducing distractions and improving manipulation performance when
compared with the baseline architecture without the self-attention mechanisms.

the operation-level search space with different convolution operations, we
jointly learn a combination of repeatable warping cells and convolution

NAS-Fusion Module is proposed to synthesize more natural final try-on results,
which is realized by leveraging particular skip connections to produce
better-fused features that are required for seamlessly fusing the warped

A particular attention of this study is paid to the interaction effect between
the Al and P atoms in the buckled silicene structure. We infer that the
interaction type is attractive and it leads to an asymmetry in the density of
states opening up a band gap. In contrast to BN-codoped silicene, the buckling
in the Al-P codoped silicene is not much influenced by the dopants as the bond
lengths of Si-P and Al-P are very similar to the Si-Si bond lengths. On the
other hand, the longer bond length of Si-Al decreases the stiffness and thus
induces fractures at smaller values of applied strain in AlSi$_6$P. The elastic
and nonelastic regions of the stress-strain curve of AlSi$_6$P depend on the
placement of the Al and P atoms. The finite band gap caused by the Al-P dopant
leads to enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient and the figure of merit, and
induces a redshift of peaks in the dielectric response, and the optical
conductivity. Finally, properties of the real and imaginary parts of the
dielectric function, the excitation spectra, the refractive index, and the
optical response of AlSi$_6$P are reported.

further integrate the APIC[Jiang et al. 2015] and MLS-MPM[Hu et al. 2018]

using both the local velocity and its first-order derivatives. Our theoretical

discretization in MLS-MPM[Hu et al. 2018], and naturally lead to a ""modified""
MLS-MPM in A-ULMPM, which can recover MLS-MPM using a completely Eulerian

high-performance GPU to run in real-time. They still are heavy in terms of

the object detection for autonomous system is run on an embedded processor, it
is preferable to compress the detection network as light as possible while
preserving the detection accuracy. There are several popular lightweight
detection models but their accuracy is too low for safe driving applications.
Therefore, this paper proposes a new object detection model, referred as
YOffleNet, which is compressed at a high ratio while minimizing the accuracy
loss for real-time and safe driving application on an autonomous system. The
backbone network architecture is based on YOLOv4, but we could compress the
network greatly by replacing the high-calculation-load CSP DenseNet with the
lighter modules of ShuffleNet. Experiments with KITTI dataset showed that the
proposed YOffleNet is compressed by 4.7 times than the YOLOv4-s that could
achieve as fast as 46 FPS on an embedded GPU system(NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier).
Compared to the high compression ratio, the accuracy is reduced slightly to
85.8% mAP, that is only 2.6% lower than YOLOv4-s. Thus, the proposed network
showed a high potential to be deployed on the embedded system of the autonomous
system for the real-time and accurate object detection applications.

It is challenging to address this degradation because the shift is often not
known \textit{a priori} and hence difficult to model. We propose a novel
framework to ensure robust segmentation in the presence of such distribution
shifts. Our contribution is three-fold. First, inspired by the spirit of
curriculum learning, we design a novel style curriculum to train the
segmentation models using an easy-to-hard mode. A style transfer model with
style fusion is employed to generate the curriculum samples. Gradually focusing
on complex and adversarial style samples can significantly boost the robustness
of the models. Second, instead of subjectively defining the curriculum
complexity, we adopt an automated gradient manipulation method to control the
hard and adversarial sample generation process. Third, we propose the Local
Gradient Sign strategy to aggregate the gradient locally and stabilise training
during gradient manipulation. The proposed framework can generalise to unknown
distribution without using any target data. Extensive experiments on the public

wireless sensor networks, transportation networks, and 4G/5G networks, have
become an integral part of our daily lives. A binary-state network (BN) is
often used to model network structures and applications. The BN reliability is
the probability that a BN functions continuously; that is, that there is always
a simple path connected between a specific pair of nodes. This metric is a
popular index for designing, managing, controlling, and evaluating networks.
The traditional BN reliability assumes that the reliability of each arc is
known in advance. However, this is not always the case. Functioning components
operate under different environments; moreover, a network might have newly
installed components. Hence, the reliability of these components is not always
known. To resolve the aforementioned problems, in which the reliability of some
components of a network are uncertain, we introduce the fuzzy concept for the
analysis of these components, and propose a new algorithm to solve this
uncertainty-component BN reliability problem. The time complexity of the
proposed algorithm is analyzed, and the superior performance of the algorithm
is demonstrated through examples.

Although deep SR networks have achieved extraordinary success, we are still

learn semantic information, or just perform complex mapping function? What
hinders SR networks from generalizing to real-world data? These questions not
only raise our curiosity, but also influence SR network development. In this
paper, we make the primary attempt to answer the above fundamental questions.
After comprehensively analyzing the feature representations (via dimensionality
reduction and visualization), we successfully discover the distinctive
""semantics"" in SR networks, i.e., deep degradation representations (DDR), which
relate to image degradation instead of image content. We show that a
well-trained deep SR network is naturally a good descriptor of degradation
information. Our experiments also reveal two key factors (adversarial learning
and global residual) that influence the extraction of such semantics. We
further apply DDR in several interesting applications (such as distortion
identification, blind SR and generalization evaluation) and achieve promising
results, demonstrating the correctness and effectiveness of our findings.

the rarefied gas region remains a great challenge. The key to success is to
obtain accurate constitutive relations for stress and heat flux. Data-driven
models offer a new phenomenological approach to learning constitutive relations
from data. Such models enable complex constitutive relations that extend
Newton's law of viscosity and Fourier's law of heat conduction by regression on
higher derivatives. However, the choices of derivatives in these models are
ad-hoc without a clear physical explanation. We investigated data-driven models
theoretically on a linear system. We argue that these models are equivalent to
non-linear length scale scaling laws of transport coefficients. The equivalence
to scaling laws justified the physical plausibility and revealed the limitation
of data-driven models. Our argument also points out that modeling the scaling
law could avoid practical difficulties in data-driven models like derivative
estimation and variable selection on noisy data. We further proposed a
constitutive relation model based on scaling law and tested it on the
calculation of Rayleigh scattering spectra. The result shows our data-driven
model has a clear advantage over the Chapman-Enskog expansion and moment
methods.

dimensions is properly defined. We study its representation theory in the
Hilbert topology by using an infinite-dimensional extension of Wigner-Mackey
theory. We obtain the necessary data in order to construct the strongly
continuous irreducible unitary representations (IRS) of B(2,1). The main
results of the representation theory are: The IRS are induced from ``little
groups'' which are compact. There is one infinite connected ``little group'',
the special orthogonal group SO(2). There are infinite non$-$connected finite
discrete ``little groups'', the cyclic groups C_{n} of even order. The inducing
construction is exhaustive notwithstanding the fact that B(2,1) is not locally
compact in the employed Hilbert topology. B(2,1) is also derived, in Klein's
sense, as the automorphism group of the ``strong conformal geometry'' of future
null infinity. Besides the Hilbert topology other reasonable topologies are
given to B(2,1) and their physical relevance is discussed. Connections of the
IRS of B(2,1) with geometry are outlined.

form complex structures. How cells pack in these structures is a fundamental
biophysical issue, underlying their functional properties. However, much
remains unknown about how cell packing geometries arise, and how they are
affected by random noise during growth - especially absent developmental
programs. Here, we quantify the statistics of cellular neighborhoods of two
different multicellular eukaryotes: lab-evolved ""snowflake"" yeast and the green
alga $Volvox~carteri$. We find that despite large differences in cellular
organization, the free space associated with individual cells in both organisms
closely fits a modified gamma distribution, consistent with maximum entropy
predictions originally developed for granular materials. This 'entropic'
cellular packing ensures a degree of predictability despite noise, facilitating
parent-offspring fidelity even in the absence of developmental regulation.
Together with simulations of diverse growth morphologies, these results suggest
that gamma-distributed cell neighborhood sizes are a general feature of
multicellularity, arising from conserved statistics of cellular packing.

It is expected that, under suitable conditions, the predictions obtained using

strength of disorder and range of stress relaxation. When the range of stress
relaxation is very low, the stress concentration plays a prominent role and the
failure process is nucleating where a single crack propagates from a particular
nucleus with a very high spatial correlation unless the disorder strength is
high. On the other hand, a high range of stress relaxation represents the
mean-field limit of the model where the failure events are random in space. At
an intermediate disorder strength and stress release range, when these two

failure. In the thermodynamic limit, we only observe a nucleating failure

modulation can be designed to manipulate the band gap where the vibration is
suppressed. The contribution of the system parameters to the band gaps has been

elementary relations between standard classical and quantum communication and

known that bits or qubits assisted by two-qubit entanglement between the sender

that higher-dimensional entanglement further enhance the power of bits or

protocols, a natural subset of entanglement-assisted quantum communication
protocols, finding that they can be understood as standard quantum
communication protocols in real-valued Hilbert space. Though such dense coding
protocols can convey up to two bits of information, we provide evidence,

(VIVT-DM cache). However, VIVT and VIVT-DM caches have some drawbacks. When the
number of sets in the cache is larger than the smallest page size, there is a
possibility of synonyms (two or more virtual addresses mapped to the same
physical address) existing in the cache. Further, maintenance of cache
coherence across multiple processors requires a physical to virtual translation
mechanism in the hardware. We describe a simple, efficient reverse lookup table
based approach to address the synonym and the coherence problems in VIVT (both
set associative and direct-mapped) caches. In particular, the proposed scheme
does not disturb the critical memory access paths in a typical micro-processor,
and requires a low overhead for its implementation. We have implemented and
validated the scheme in the AJIT 32-bit microprocessor core (an implementation
of the SPARC-V8 ISA) and the implementation uses approximately 2% of the gates
and 5.3% of the memory bits in the processor core.

completely remove tokens with style at the token level, which incurs the loss

Then, we develop a differentiable point cloud rendering unit (DRU) as an
end-to-end module in our network to render the point cloud into multi-view

represent chemical kinetics. KiNet takes the current composition states and
predicts the evolution of the states after a fixed time step. The long-period
evolution of the states and their gradients to model parameters can be
efficiently obtained by recursively applying the KiNet model multiple times. To
address the challenges of the high-dimensional composition space and error
accumulation in long-period prediction, the architecture of KiNet incorporates
the residual network model (ResNet), and the training employs backpropagation
through time (BPTT) approach to minimize multi-step prediction error. In
addition, an approach for efficiently computing the gradient of the ignition
delay time (IDT) to KiNet model parameters is proposed to train the KiNet
against the rich database of IDT from literature, which could address the
scarcity of time-resolved species measurements. The KiNet is first trained and
compared with the simulated species profiles during the auto-ignition of H2/air
mixtures. The obtained KiNet model can accurately predict the auto-ignition
processes for various initial conditions that cover a wide range of pressures,
temperatures, and equivalence ratios. Then, we show that the gradient of IDT to
KiNet model parameters is parallel to the gradient of the temperature at the
ignition point. This correlation enables efficient computation of the gradient
of IDT via backpropagation and is demonstrated as a feasible approach for
fine-tuning the KiNet against IDT. These demonstrations shall open up the
possibility of building data-driven kinetic models autonomously. Finally, the
trained KiNet could be potentially applied to kinetic model reduction and
chemistry acceleration in turbulent combustion simulations.

Earth and Mars, there is a strong westerly jet in the winter hemisphere and
weak, low-level westerlies in the ascending regions of the Hadley cell in the
summer hemisphere. This summer jet has been less explored in a broad planetary
context, both due to the dominance of the winter jet and since the balances
controlling it are more complex, and understanding them requires exploring a
broader parameter regime. To better understand the jet characteristics on
terrestrial planets and the transition between winter- and summer-dominated jet
regimes, we explore the jet's dependence on rotation rate and obliquity. Across
a significant portion of the parameter space, the dominant jet is in the winter
hemisphere, and the summer jet is weaker and restricted to the boundary layer.
However, we show that for slow rotation rates and high obliquities, the
strongest jet is in the summer rather than the winter hemisphere. Analysis of
the summer jet's momentum balance reveals that the balance is not simply
cyclostrophic and that both boundary layer drag and vertical advection are
essential. At high obliquities and slow rotation rates, the cross-equatorial
winter cell is wide and strong. The returning poleward flow in the summer
hemisphere is balanced by low-level westerlies through an Ekman balance and
momentum is advected upwards close to the ascending branch, resulting in a
mid-troposphere summer jet.

detection models using exclusively normal data or unlabeled data (mostly normal
samples). One notorious issue with these approaches is that they are weak in
discriminating anomalies from normal samples due to the lack of the knowledge
about the anomalies. Here, we study the problem of few-shot anomaly detection,
in which we aim at using a few labeled anomaly examples to train
sample-efficient discriminative detection models. To address this problem, we
introduce a novel weakly-supervised anomaly detection framework to train
detection models without assuming the examples illustrating all possible
classes of anomaly.
  Specifically, the proposed approach learns discriminative normality
(regularity) by leveraging the labeled anomalies and a prior probability to
enforce expressive representations of normality and unbounded deviated
representations of abnormality. This is achieved by an end-to-end optimization
of anomaly scores with a neural deviation learning, in which the anomaly scores
of normal samples are imposed to approximate scalar scores drawn from the prior
while that of anomaly examples is enforced to have statistically significant
deviations from these sampled scores in the upper tail. Furthermore, our model
is optimized to learn fine-grained normality and abnormality by top-K
multiple-instance-learning-based feature subspace deviation learning, allowing
more generalized representations. Comprehensive experiments on nine real-world
image anomaly detection benchmarks show that our model is substantially more
sample-efficient and robust, and performs significantly better than
state-of-the-art competing methods in both closed-set and open-set settings.
Our model can also offer explanation capability as a result of its prior-driven
anomaly score learning. Code and datasets are available at:

the ontological structure of human intelligence. However, it remains an open
question, whether anatomical properties of the brain support the same ontology.
The present study explored the ontological structure derived from
neuroanatomical networks associated with performance in 15 cognitive tasks
indicating various abilities. Results suggest that the brain-derived
(neurometric) ontology is partly consistent with the cognitive
performance-derived (psychometric) ontology. However, there are interpretable
and complementary differences as well. Moreover, the cortical areas associated
with different inferred abilities are segregated, with little or no overlap.
Nevertheless, these spatially segregated cortical areas are integrated via
denser white matter structural connections as compared with the general brain
connectome. The integration of ability-related cortical networks constitutes a
neural counterpart to the psychometric construct of general intelligence, while
the consistency and differences between psychometric and neurometric ontologies
represent crucial pieces of knowledge for theory building, clinical diagnostics
and treatment.

we propose a two-layer hierarchical machine learning model having an accuracy

model to focus its training on the targeted task of the layer, resulting in
improvement in model accuracy. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed

effortlessly find the objects of the same category in another image and
precisely tell their visual boundaries. Such visual cognition capability of
humans seems absent from the current research spectrum of computer vision.
Existing segmentation networks, for example, rely on a humongous amount of
labeled data, which is laborious and costly to collect and annotate; besides,
the performance of segmentation networks tend to downgrade as the number of the
category increases. In this paper, we introduce a novel Reference semantic
segmentation Network (Ref-Net) to conduct visual boundary knowledge
translation. Ref-Net contains a Reference Segmentation Module (RSM) and a
Boundary Knowledge Translation Module (BKTM). Inspired by the human recognition
mechanism, RSM is devised only to segment the same category objects based on
the features of the reference objects. BKTM, on the other hand, introduces two
boundary discriminator branches to conduct inner and outer boundary
segmentation of the target objectin an adversarial manner, and translate the
annotated boundary knowledge of open-source datasets into the segmentation
network. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate that, with tens of finely-grained
annotated samples as guidance, Ref-Net achieves results on par with fully
supervised methods on six datasets.

citations of the PySM 2 publication. As the resolution of upcoming experiments
increases, the PySM 2 software has started to show some limitations, the
solution to these issues was to reimplement PySM from scratch focusing on these
features: reimplement all the models with the numba Just-In-Time compiler for
Python to reduce memory overhead and optimize performance; use MPI through
mpi4py to coordinate execution of PySM 3 across multiple nodes and rely on
libsharp, for distributed spherical harmonic transforms; employ the data

no prior knowledge of the network structure and identifies the underlying

find a low dimensional representation of the dynamical patterns that evolve
linearly. Further, we use the global linear Koopman model to solve critical

in the strip $0< {\rm Re}(s) < 1$ except for the critical line where ${\rm
Re}(s) = 1/2$. However, determining whether a point in the strip is a zero of a
complex function is a challenging task. Bombieri proposed an assertion in the
Official Problem Description that states, ``The Riemann hypothesis is
equivalent to the statement that all local maxima of $\xi(t)$ (namely $\xi(s)$
on the critical line) are positive and all local minima are negative."" In this
paper, we follow Bombieri's idea to study the Riemann hypothesis. First, we
show that on the critical line, the $\xi(s)$ function (which is then a real
function of a single real variable) obeys a special differential equation, such
that it satisfies Bombieri's equivalence condition. Then, since we have been
unable to locate the original proof of Bombieri's equivalence theorem, we
independently provide a proof for the sufficiency part of it. Namely, if the
$\xi(s)$ function satisfies Bombieri's equivalence condition on the critical
line, then by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, it has no zeros outside this
critical line. Thus, we can conclude that the Riemann hypothesis is true.
Finally, we comment on P\'olya's counterexample against using the simplified
$\xi(s)$ function to study the Riemann hypothesis, noting that it violates
Bombieri's equivalence theorem.
