examinatorial application, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is still a slow
imaging modality which limits its use for dynamic imaging. In recent years,
Parallel Imaging (PI) and Compressed Sensing (CS) have been utilised to
accelerate the MRI acquisition. In clinical settings, subsampling the k-space
measurements during scanning time using Cartesian trajectories, such as
rectilinear sampling, is currently the most conventional CS approach applied
which, however, is prone to producing aliased reconstructions. With the advent
of the involvement of Deep Learning (DL) in accelerating the MRI,
reconstructing faithful images from subsampled data became increasingly
promising. Retrospectively applying a subsampling mask onto the k-space data is
a way of simulating the accelerated acquisition of k-space data in real
clinical setting. In this paper we compare and provide a review for the effect
of applying either rectilinear or radial retrospective subsampling on the
quality of the reconstructions outputted by trained deep neural networks. With
the same choice of hyper-parameters, we train and evaluate two distinct
Recurrent Inference Machines (RIMs), one for each type of subsampling. The
qualitative and quantitative results of our experiments indicate that the model
trained on data with radial subsampling attains higher performance and learns
to estimate reconstructions with higher fidelity paving the way for other DL
approaches to involve radial subsampling.

and a non-chiral superconductor. When the coupling across the interface is
sufficiently strong, the interface undergoes a transition into a phase
characterized by a condensation of a bound state of a Bogoliubov quasiparticle
in the superconductor and an emergent fermionic excitation in the spin liquid.
In the condensed phase, electrons in the superconductor can coherently convert
into emergent fermions in the spin liquid and vice versa. As a result, the
chiral Majorana edge mode of the spin liquid becomes visible in the electronic
local density of states at the interface, which can be measured in scanning
tunneling spectroscopy experiments. We demonstrate the existence of this phase
transition, and the non-local order parameter that characterizes it, using
density matrix renormalization group simulations of a KSL strip coupled at its
edge to a superconductor. An analogous phase transition can occur in a simpler
system composed of a one-dimensional spin chain with a spin-flip $\mathbb{Z}_2$
symmetry coupled to a superconductor.

capturing high dimensional (HD) data in an efficient way. It is generally
implemented by two components: an optical encoder that compresses HD signals
into a 2D measurement and an algorithm decoder that retrieves the HD data upon
the hardware-encoded measurement. Over a broad range of SCI applications,
hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and video compressive sensing have received
significant research attention in recent years. Among existing SCI
reconstruction algorithms, deep learning-based methods stand out as their
promising performance and efficient inference. However, the deep reconstruction
network may suffer from overlarge model size and highly-specialized network
design, which inevitably lead to costly training time, high memory usage, and
limited flexibility, thus discouraging the deployments of SCI systems in
practical scenarios. In this paper, we tackle the above challenges by proposing
a simple yet highly efficient reconstruction method, namely stacked residual
network (SRN), by revisiting the residual learning strategy with nested
structures and spatial-invariant property. The proposed SRN empowers
high-fidelity data retrieval with fewer computation operations and negligible
model size compared with existing networks, and also serves as a versatile
backbone applicable for both hyperspectral and video data. Based on the
proposed backbone, we first develop the channel attention enhanced SRN
(CAE-SRN) to explore the spectral inter-dependencies for fine-grained spatial
estimation in HSI. We then employ SRN as a deep denoiser and incorporate it
into a generalized alternating projection (GAP) framework -- resulting in
GAP-SRN -- to handle the video compressive sensing task. Experimental results
demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance, high computational efficiency of
the proposed SRN on two SCI applications.

is injected in the active region (AR) corona through photospheric footpoint
motions causing twisted and sheared magnetic fields. From the conservation
property of the helicity, it was conjectured that an already twisted flux rope
(FR) with continuous injection of MH inevitably erupts to remove the excess
accumulated coronal helicity. Therefore, understanding the nature and evolution
of the photospheric helicity flux transfer is crucial to reveal the intensity
of the flare/CME activity. Using the time-sequence vector-magnetograms of
\textit{Helioseismic Magnetic Imager}, we study the evolution of MH injection
in emerging AR 12257. The photospheric flux motions in this AR inject positive
helicity in the first 2.5 days followed by negative helicity later. This
successive injection of opposite helicity is consistent with the sign of mean
force-free twist parameter ($\alpha_{av}$), orientation of magnetic-tongues.
Also, the extrapolated AR magnetic structure exhibits transformation of
global-shear without a twisted FR in the core of the AR. No CMEs are launched
from this AR but C-class flaring activity is observed predominantly in the
second half of the evolution period. The ARs with sign reversal of the MH
injection are not favorable to twisted FR formation with excess coronal
helicity and therefore are important to identify CME-less ARs readily. A
possible scenario in these ARs is that when one sign of helicity flux is
replaced by opposite sign, the magnetic field of different connectivity with
opposite shear undergoes reconnection at different scales giving rise to both
intermittent flares and enhanced coronal heating.

therefore, intelligent decision-making is crucial for the performance of
lifelong learning systems. In addition, the order in which samples arrive may
heavily affect the performance of online (and offline) incremental learners.
The recently introduced incremental cluster validity indices (iCVIs) provide
valuable aid in addressing such class of problems. Their primary use-case has
been cluster quality monitoring; nonetheless, they have been very recently
integrated in a streaming clustering method to assist the clustering task
itself. In this context, the work presented here introduces the first adaptive
resonance theory (ART)-based model that uses iCVIs for unsupervised and
semi-supervised online learning. Moreover, it shows for the first time how to
use iCVIs to regulate ART vigilance via an iCVI-based match tracking mechanism.
The model achieves improved accuracy and robustness to ordering effects by
integrating an online iCVI framework as module B of a topological adaptive
resonance theory predictive mapping (TopoARTMAP) -- thereby being named
iCVI-TopoARTMAP -- and by employing iCVI-driven post-processing heuristics at
the end of each learning step. The online iCVI framework provides assignments
of input samples to clusters at each iteration in accordance to any of several
iCVIs. The iCVI-TopoARTMAP maintains useful properties shared by ARTMAP models,
such as stability, immunity to catastrophic forgetting, and the many-to-one
mapping capability via the map field module. The performance (unsupervised and
semi-supervised) and robustness to presentation order (unsupervised) of
iCVI-TopoARTMAP were evaluated via experiments with a synthetic data set and
deep embeddings of a real-world face image data set.

required to obtain good accuracy, even if we provide a sufficient number of

Additionally, the K\""ahler potential of the linear system geometry corresponds
to the square of the weighted Hardy norms of its composite transfer functions.
Based on the properties of K\""ahler manifold, geometric objects on the
manifolds from arbitrary weight vectors are computed in much simpler ways.
Moreover, K\""ahler information manifolds of signal filters in weighted Hardy
spaces incorporate various well-known information manifolds under the unified
framework. We also cover several examples from time series models of which
metric tensor, Levi-Civita connection, and K\""ahler potentials are represented
with polylogarithm of poles and zeros from the transfer functions with the
weight vectors are given as a family of exponential forms.

non-expansive retracts, and also lattices in the induced partial order.
Moreover, they retain properties of convex sets, with a notion of convex hull
defined only up to isomorphism. For deterministic games with finite action
spaces, these fixed point sets are supports of polyhedral complexes, with a
cell decomposition attached to stationary strategies of the players, in which
each cell is an alcoved polyhedron of $A_n$ type. We finally provide an

recently during scalar field decay, this work extends the study of dark matter
freeze-out to a potential early period during which the universe is

matter dominated era changes the freeze-out dynamics, since the Hubble rate is
parametrically different for matter and radiation domination. Furthermore, for
successful Big Bang Nucleosynthesis the state dominating the early universe

measurements in superconducting MATBG in which the correlated insulator states
are suppressed by screening. The uninterrupted metallic ground state shows
resistivity that is linear in temperature over three decades and spans a broad
range of doping including those where a correlation-driven Fermi surface
reconstruction occurs. This strange-metal behavior is distinguished by
Planckian scattering rates and a linear magnetoresistivity. In contrast, near
charge neutrality or a fully-filled flat band, as well as for devices twisted
away from the magic angle, we observe the archetypal Fermi liquid behavior. Our
measurements demonstrate the existence of a quantum critical phase whose
fluctuations dominate the metallic ground state throughout a continuum of
doping. Further, we observe a transition to the strange metal upon suppression
of the superconducting order, suggesting a relationship between quantum
fluctuations and superconductivity in MATBG.

slitmasks on 2019 March 3 and April 2. Photometric data were obtained with a
number of 1 m-class telescopes during the same nights. The narrow-line region
(NLR) is spatially resolved; therefore, its variable contributions to the slit
spectra make the standard procedure of relative flux calibration impractical.
We demonstrate that spatially-resolved data from the IFS can be effectively
used to correct the slit-mask spectral light curves. While we obtained no
reliable lag owing to the lack of strong variability pattern in the light
curves, we constrain the broad line time lag to be less than 3 hr, consistent
with the photometric lag of $\sim80$ min reported by Woo et al. (2019). By
exploiting the high-quality spectra, we measure the second moment of the broad
component of the H$\alpha$ emission line to be $586\pm19$ km s$^{-1}$,
superseding the lower value reported by Woo et al. (2019). Combining the
revised line dispersion and the photometric time lag, we update the black hole
mass as $(1.7\pm 0.3)\times10^4$ M$_{\odot}$.

particularly satellite communication networks, is under exploration in 3GPP.
The movement of the spaceborne platforms in NTNs may result in large timing
varying Doppler shift that differs for devices in different locations. Using
orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) in the uplink, each
device will need to apply a different frequency adjustment value to compensate
for the Doppler shift. To this end, the 3GPP Release-17 work on NTNs assumes
that an NTN device is equipped with a global navigation satellite system (GNSS)
chipset and thereby can determine its position and calculate the needed
frequency adjustment value using its position information and satellite
ephemeris data. This makes GNSS support essential for the NTN operation.
However, GNSS signals are weak, not ubiquitous, and susceptible to interference
and spoofing. We show that devices without access to GNSS signals can utilize
reference signals in more than one frequency position in an OFDM carrier to
estimate the Doppler shift and thereby determine the needed frequency
adjustment value for pre-compensating the Doppler shift in the uplink. We
analyze the performance, elaborate on how to utilize the NR reference signals,
and present simulation results. The solution can reduce the dependency of NTN
operation on GNSS with reasonable complexity and performance trade-off.

labeled edges (or facts) in a graph are mostly constructed using a suite of

results in a probabilistic knowledge graph. Graph queries over such
probabilistic KGs require answer computation along with the computation of
those result probabilities, aka, probabilistic inference. We propose a system,
HAPPI (How Provenance of Probabilistic Inference), to handle such query
processing. Complying with the standard provenance semiring model, we propose a
novel commutative semiring to symbolically compute the probability of the
result of a query. These provenance-polynomiallike symbolic expressions encode
fine-grained information about the probability computation process. We leverage
this encoding to efficiently compute as well as maintain the probability of
results as the underlying KG changes. Focusing on a popular class of
conjunctive basic graph pattern queries on the KG, we compare the performance
of HAPPI against a possible-world model of computation and a knowledge
compilation tool over two large datasets. We also propose an adaptive system
that leverages the strengths of both HAPPI and compilation based techniques.
Since existing systems for probabilistic databases mostly focus on query
computation, they default to re-computation when facts in the KG are updated.
HAPPI, on the other hand, does not just perform probabilistic inference and
maintain their provenance, but also provides a mechanism to incrementally
maintain them as the KG changes. We extend this maintainability as part of our
proposed adaptive system.

challenge in realizing fracton-like models in standard condensed matter
platforms is the creation of multi-spin interactions, since realistic systems
are typically dominated by two-body interactions. In this work, we demonstrate
that the Van der Waals interaction and experimental tunability of Rydberg-based

non-rotating black holes, parametrized by the field coupling parameter $\beta$
and magnetic charge parameter $P$ in detail. Particularly, we survey physical
properties of the magnetically charged black hole, thermodynamic properties,
observational appearance, quasinormal modes and absorption cross sections. We
then show that the black hole gets colder with increasing charge. Investigating
the heat capacity, we see that the black hole is thermally stable, which is
amplified by introduction of a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) with a
quantum gravity parameter $\lambda$. Then we compute the deflection angle at
the weak field limit, by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem and the geodesic equation,
showing that the magnetic charge has a contribution at the first order. By
ray-tracing we simulate the observational appearance of a NED black hole with
thin disk and spherical accretion. We find that the parameter $P$ has a very
strong effect on the shadow radius. We consider quasinormal modes under
massless scalar perturbations of the black hole and the greybody factor. We
find that the charge introduces a slight difference in the fundamental
frequency and that the greybody factor of the NED black hole is strongly
steepened by the introduction of increasing charge. To present observational
constrains, we show that the magnetic charge of the M87* black hole is between
$0\leq P\leq0.024$ in units of M, in agreement with the idea that real
astrophysical black holes are mostly neutral. We also find that LIGO/VIRGO and
LISA could detect NED black hole perturbations from BHs with masses between
$5M_\odot$ and $8.0\cdot 10^8\,M_\odot$. We finally show that for black holes
with masses detected with LIGO so far, charged NED black holes would deviate
from Schwarzschild by $5\sim 10$ Hz in their fundamental frequencies.

revisions expressible by a total preorder over a limited set of worlds. For a
belief change operator, we consider the scope, which consists of those beliefs
which yield success of revision. We show that for each set satisfying single
sentence closure and disjunction completeness there exists a dynamic-limited

investigate iteration postulates for belief and scope dynamics and characterise
them for dynamic-limited revision. As an application, we employ dynamic-limited
revision to studying belief revision in the context of so-called inherent
beliefs, which are beliefs globally accepted by the agent. This leads to
revision operators which we call inherence-limited. We present a representation
theorem for inherence-limited revision, and we compare these operators and

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used in many state-of-the-art

trained on a suitable dataset with labels for muon images. However, by training
a CNN on a dataset labelled by existing algorithms, the performance of the CNN
would be limited by the suboptimal muon-identification efficiency of the
original algorithms. Muon Hunters 2 is a citizen science project that asks
users to label grids of VERITAS telescope images, stating which images contain
muon rings. Each image is labelled 10 times by independent volunteers, and the
votes are aggregated and used to assign a `muon' or `non-muon' label to the
corresponding image. An analysis was performed using an expert-labelled dataset
in order to determine the optimal vote percentage cut-offs for assigning labels
to each image for CNN training. This was optimised so as to identify as many

model greatly improves on existing muon identification algorithms, identifying
approximately 30 times the number of muon images identified by the current

the requirements of DNN with respect to the availability of training data. We
focus on the setting in which labelled data are only available in a source
domain DS, but not in a target domain DT. Our method is based on adversarial
training of an appearance adaptation network (AAN) that transforms images from
DS such that they look like images from DT. Together with the original label
maps from DS, the transformed images are used to adapt a DNN to DT. We propose
a joint training strategy of the AAN and the classifier, which constrains the
AAN to transform the images such that they are correctly classified. In this
way, objects of a certain class are changed such that they resemble objects of
the same class in DT. To further improve the adaptation performance, we propose
a new regularization loss for the discriminator network used in domain
adversarial training. We also address the problem of finding the optimal values
of the trained network parameters, proposing an unsupervised entropy based
parameter selection criterion which compensates for the fact that there is no
validation set in DT that could be monitored. As a minor contribution, we
present a new weighting strategy for the cross-entropy loss, addressing the
problem of imbalanced class distributions. Our method is evaluated in 42

their temporal locations from the video. Previous methods follow a
sophisticated ""localize-then-describe"" scheme, which heavily relies on numerous
hand-crafted components. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet effective
framework for end-to-end dense video captioning with parallel decoding (PDVC),
by formulating the dense caption generation as a set prediction task. In
practice, through stacking a newly proposed event counter on the top of a
transformer decoder, the PDVC precisely segments the video into a number of
event pieces under the holistic understanding of the video content, which
effectively increases the coherence and readability of predicted captions.
Compared with prior arts, the PDVC has several appealing advantages: (1)
Without relying on heuristic non-maximum suppression or a recurrent event
sequence selection network to remove redundancy, PDVC directly produces an
event set with an appropriate size; (2) In contrast to adopting the two-stage
scheme, we feed the enhanced representations of event queries into the
localization head and caption head in parallel, making these two sub-tasks
deeply interrelated and mutually promoted through the optimization; (3) Without
bells and whistles, extensive experiments on ActivityNet Captions and YouCook2
show that PDVC is capable of producing high-quality captioning results,
surpassing the state-of-the-art two-stage methods when its localization
accuracy is on par with them. Code is available at

Dirac nodes, at the momentum points $X_1$ and $X_2$, are anisotropic, i.e.,
disperse with different velocities in different directions, whereas the third
Dirac point at $M$ is isotropic. Interestingly we find that the system of these
three Dirac nodes hold a single low-energy plasmon mode, within its
particle-hole gap, that disperses in isotropic manner, in the case when the
nodes at $X_1$ and $X_2$ are related by symmetry, which we further show in a

However, one major bottleneck is the scarcity of annotated real datasets,

is involved in annotating the real scans of a scene. A promising solution to
this problem is to make better use of the synthetic dataset, which consists of
CAD object models, to boost the learning on real datasets. This can be achieved
by the pre-training and fine-tuning procedure. However, recent work on 3D
pre-training exhibits failure when transfer features learned on synthetic
objects to other real-world applications. In this work, we put forward a new
method called RandomRooms to accomplish this objective. In particular, we
propose to generate random layouts of a scene by making use of the objects in
the synthetic CAD dataset and learn the 3D scene representation by applying
object-level contrastive learning on two random scenes generated from the same
set of synthetic objects. The model pre-trained in this way can serve as a
better initialization when later fine-tuning on the 3D object detection task.
Empirically, we show consistent improvement in downstream 3D detection tasks on
several base models, especially when less training data are used, which
strongly demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization of our method.
Benefiting from the rich semantic knowledge and diverse objects from synthetic

the large inter-video score variations. In this paper, we show that the
relations among videos can provide important clues for more accurate action
quality assessment during both training and inference. Specifically, we
reformulate the problem of action quality assessment as regressing the relative
scores with reference to another video that has shared attributes (e.g.,
category and difficulty), instead of learning unreferenced scores. Following
this formulation, we propose a new Contrastive Regression (CoRe) framework to
learn the relative scores by pair-wise comparison, which highlights the
differences between videos and guides the models to learn the key hints for
assessment. In order to further exploit the relative information between two
videos, we devise a group-aware regression tree to convert the conventional
score regression into two easier sub-problems: coarse-to-fine classification
and regression in small intervals. To demonstrate the effectiveness of CoRe, we
conduct extensive experiments on three mainstream AQA datasets including AQA-7,

perturbations with arbitrary time and scale dependence. We apply this formalism
to four different combinations of baryon and CDM isocurvature modes, and use
Planck CMB-anisotropy data to probe their initial amplitude. We find that
Planck data is consistent with no small-scale isocurvature perturbations, and
that this additional ingredient does not help alleviate the Hubble tension. We
set upper bounds to the dimensionless initial power spectrum
$\Delta_{\mathcal{I}}^2(k)$ of these isocurvature modes at comoving wavenumbers

As planets and stars accrete from discs, if the specific angular momentum
accreted corresponds to that of a Keplerian orbit at the surface of the object,
it is possible for planets and stars to be spun up to near-breakup speeds.
However, accretion cannot proceed onto planets and stars in the same way that
accretion proceeds through the disk. For example, the magneto-rotational
instability cannot operate in the region between the nearly-Keplerian disk and
more slowly-rotating surface because of the sign of the angular velocity
gradient. Through this boundary layer where the angular velocity sharply
changes, mass and angular momentum transport is thought to be driven by
acoustic waves generated by global supersonic shear instabilities and vortices.
We present the first study of this mechanism for angular momentum transport
around rotating stars and planets using 2D vertically-integrated moving-mesh
simulations of ideal hydrodynamics. We find that above rotation rates of
$\sim0.4-0.6$ times the Keplerian rate at the surface, depending on the gas
sound speed, the rate at which angular momentum is transported inwards through
the boundary layer by waves decreases by $\sim1-3$ orders of magnitude. We also
find that the accretion rate through the boundary layer decreases
commensurately and becomes less variable for faster-rotating objects. Our
results provide a purely hydrodynamic mechanism for limiting the spins of
accreting planets and stars to factors of a few less than the breakup speed.

However, because the majority of Seyfert/LINER hosts are star forming (SF), HII
regions contaminate the observed lines to some extent, making it unclear if the
position along the branch is merely due to various degrees of mixing between
pure Seyfert/LINER and SF, or whether it reflects the intrinsic diversity of
Seyfert/LINER ionizing sources. In this study, we empirically remove SF
contributions in ~100,000 Seyfert/LINERs from SDSS using the doppelganger
method. We find that mixing is not the principal cause of the extended
morphology of the observed branch. Rather, Seyferts/LINERs intrinsically have a
wide range of line ratios. Variations in ionization parameter and metallicity
can account for much of the diversity of Seyfert/LINER line ratios, but the
hardness of ionization field also varies significantly. Furthermore, our
k-means classification on seven decontaminated emission lines reveals that
LINERs are made up of two populations, which we call soft and hard LINERs. The
Seyfert 2s differ from both types of LINERs primarily by higher ionization
parameter, whereas the two LINER types mainly differ from each other (and from
star-forming regions) in the hardness of the radiation field. We confirm that
the [NII] BPT diagram more efficiently identifies LINERs than [SII] and [OI]
diagnostics, because in the latter many LINERs, especially soft ones, occupy
the same location as pure star-formers, even after the SF has been removed from

on so-called circumprimary or circumsecondary orbits, as well as around the
entire binary system on so-called circumbinary orbits. Depending on the orbital
parameters of the binary system a planet will be dynamically stable if it
orbits within some critical separation of the semimajor axis in the
circumprimary case, or beyond some critical separation for the circumbinary
case. We present N-body simulations of star-forming regions that contain
populations of primordial binaries to determine the fraction of binary systems
that can host stable planets at various semimajor axes, and how this fraction
of stable systems evolves over time. Dynamical encounters in star-forming
regions can alter the orbits of some binary systems, which can induce long-term
dynamical instabilities in the planetary system and can even change the size of
the habitable zone(s) of the component stars. However, the overall fraction of
binaries that can host stable planetary systems is not greatly affected by
either the assumed binary population, or the density of the star-forming

systems exist in the Galaxy is the stellar binary fraction - the more stars
that are born as singles in stellar nurseries, the higher the fraction of
stable planetary systems.

study two phenomena. First, we investigate an uncertainty relation -- in the
style of Heisenberg's 1929 thought experiment -- which includes partial
measurements in addition to projective measurements. We find that a weak
partial measurement can decrease the uncertainty between two incompatible

of irreversible dynamics resulting from partial measurements. We do so by
comparing the forward and time-reversed probabilities of measurement outcomes
resulting from post-selected feedback protocols with both causal and
reversed-causal order. We find that the statistics of partial measurements
produce entropy in accordance with generalized second laws of thermodynamics.

for consumers and hence accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles. A major
barrier to shorter charge times is the accelerated aging of the battery at
higher charging rates, which can be driven by lithium plating, increased solid
electrolyte interphase growth due to elevated temperatures, and particle
cracking due to mechanical stress. Lithium plating depends on the overpotential
of the negative electrode, and mechanical stress depends on the concentration
gradient, both of which cannot be measured directly. Techniques based on
physics-based models of the battery and optimal control algorithms have been
developed to this end. While these methods show promise in reducing
degradation, their optimization algorithms' complexity can limit their
implementation. In this paper, we present a method based on the constant
current constant voltage (CC-CV) charging scheme, called CC-CV$\eta \sigma$T
(VEST). The new approach is simpler to implement and can be used with any model
to impose varying levels of constraints on variables pertinent to degradation,
such as plating potential and mechanical stress. We demonstrate the new
CC-CV$\eta \sigma$T charging using an electrochemical model with mechanical and
thermal effects included. Furthermore, we discuss how uncertainties can be
accounted for by considering safety margins for the plating and stress
constraints.

convolution neural networks (CNNs) with skip connections to combine the global
contexts and local spatial details that are crucial for locating salient
objects and refining object details, respectively. Despite great successes, the
ability of CNNs in learning global contexts is limited. Recently, the vision
transformer has achieved revolutionary progress in computer vision owing to its
powerful modeling of global dependencies. However, directly applying the
transformer to SOD is suboptimal because the transformer lacks the ability to
learn local spatial representations. To this end, this paper explores the
combination of transformers and CNNs to learn both global and local
representations for SOD. We propose a transformer-based Asymmetric Bilateral
U-Net (ABiU-Net). The asymmetric bilateral encoder has a transformer path and a
lightweight CNN path, where the two paths communicate at each encoder stage to
learn complementary global contexts and local spatial details, respectively.
The asymmetric bilateral decoder also consists of two paths to process features
from the transformer and CNN encoder paths, with communication at each decoder
stage for decoding coarse salient object locations and fine-grained object
details, respectively. Such communication between the two encoder/decoder paths
enables AbiU-Net to learn complementary global and local representations,
taking advantage of the natural properties of transformers and CNNs,
respectively. Hence, ABiU-Net provides a new perspective for transformer-based
SOD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ABiU-Net performs favorably against
previous state-of-the-art SOD methods. The code is available at

that the Majorana solution has a behavior similar to that of massless Dirac
particles and finding a relationship between the zeros of zeta end the energy
states. Then, we focus on the $S$-matrix approach describing the bosonic open
string scattering for tachyonic states with the Majorana equation. Here we find
that, thanks to the relationship between the angular momentum and energy/mass
eigenvalues of the Majorana solution, one can explain the still unclear point
for which the poles and zeros of the $S$-matrix of an ideal system that can
satisfy the Riemann Hypothesis, exist always in pairs and are related via
complex conjugation. As claimed in the literature, if this occurs and the claim
is correct, then the Riemann Hypothesis could be in principle satisfied,
tracing a route to a proof.

Twenty data visualization practitioners were interviewed and asked about their

methods they use. Findings suggest that practitioners do not follow highly
systematic processes, but instead rely on situated forms of knowing and acting
in which they draw from precedent and use methods and principles that are

management of many diseases in modern healthcare, and plays a critical role in
cancer care. Pathology samples can be large and require multi-site sampling,
leading to upwards of 20 slides for a single tumor, and the human-expert tasks
of site selection and and quantitative assessment of mitotic figures are time
consuming and subjective. Automating these tasks in the setting of a digital
pathology service presents significant opportunities to improve workflow
efficiency and augment human experts in practice. Approach: Multiple
state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for histopathology image
classification and mitotic figure detection were used in the development of
OncoPetNet. Additionally, model-free approaches were used to increase speed and
accuracy. The robust and scalable inference engine leverages Pytorch's
performance optimizations as well as specifically developed speed up techniques
in inference. Results: The proposed system, demonstrated significantly improved
mitotic counting performance for 41 cancer cases across 14 cancer types
compared to human expert baselines. In 21.9% of cases use of OncoPetNet led to
change in tumor grading compared to human expert evaluation. In deployment, an
effective 0.27 min/slide inference was achieved in a high throughput veterinary
diagnostic pathology service across 2 centers processing 3,323 digital whole
slide images daily. Conclusion: This work represents the first successful
automated deployment of deep learning systems for real-time expert-level
performance on important histopathology tasks at scale in a high volume
clinical practice. The resulting impact outlines important considerations for
model development, deployment, clinical decision making, and informs best
practices for implementation of deep learning systems in digital histopathology
practices.

detection and localization of UAVs will be critical for maintaining safe and
secure airspace in the future. In this work, Keysight N6854A radio frequency
(RF) sensors are used to detect and locate a UAV by passively monitoring the
signals emitted from the UAV. First, the Keysight sensor detects the UAV by
comparing the received RF signature with various other UAVs' RF signatures in
the Keysight database using an envelope detection algorithm. Afterward, time
difference of arrival (TDoA) based localization is performed by a central
controller using the sensor data, and the drone is localized with some error.
To mitigate the localization error, implementation of an extended Kalman
filter~(EKF) is proposed in this study. The performance of the proposed
approach is evaluated on a realistic experimental dataset. EKF requires basic
assumptions on the type of motion throughout the trajectory, i.e., the movement
of the object is assumed to fit some motion model~(MM) such as constant
velocity (CV), constant acceleration (CA), and constant turn (CT). In the
experiments, an arbitrary trajectory is followed, therefore it is not feasible
to fit the whole trajectory into a single MM. Consequently, the trajectory is
segmented into sub-parts and a different MM is assumed in each segment while
building the EKF model. Simulation results demonstrate an improvement in error
statistics when EKF is used if the MM assumption aligns with the real motion.

appear in ovaries of F1 female offspring of D. yakuba female x D. santomea

activation, where transcripts silenced in one lineage are activated by the
transcriptional machinery of the other genome. These results point to a
fundamentally new model of new gene creation that does not rely on the

equation with advection of a strength $\beta\in\mathbb{R}$. This equation
exhibits a transition from pulled to pushed front behavior at $\beta_c=2$. We
prove convergence of the solutions to a traveling wave in a reference frame
centered at a position $m_\beta(t)$ and study the asymptotics of the front
location $m_\beta(t)$. When $\beta < 2$, it has the same form as for the
standard Fisher-KPP equation established by Bramson \cite{Bramson1,Bramson2}:
$m_\beta(t) = 2t - (3/2)\log(t) + x_\infty + o(1)$ as $t\to+\infty$. This form
is typical of pulled fronts. When $\beta > 2$, the front is located at the
position $m_\beta(t)=c_*(\beta)t+x_\infty+o(1)$ with
$c_*(\beta)=\beta/2+2/\beta$, which is the typical form of pushed fronts.
However, at the critical value $\beta_c = 2$, the expansion changes to
$m_\beta(t) = 2t - (1/2)\log(t) + x_\infty + o(1)$, reflecting the
""pushmi-pullyu"" nature of the front. The arguments for $\beta<2$ rely on a new
weighted Hopf-Cole transform that allows to control the advection term, when
combined with additional steepness comparison arguments. The case $\beta>2$
relies on standard pushed front techniques. The proof in the case
$\beta=\beta_c$ is much more intricate and involves arguments not usually
encountered in the study of the Bramson correction. It relies on a somewhat
hidden viscous conservation law structure of the Burgers-FKPP equation at
$\beta_c=2$ and utilizes a dissipation inequality, which comes from a relative

primary feature in Parkinson's disease (PD). Iron deposition occurs in
conjunction with this loss. Loss of nigral neurons should remove barriers for
diffusion and increase diffusivity of water molecules in regions undergoing
this loss. In metrics from single-compartment diffusion tensor imaging models,
these changes should manifest as increases in mean diffusivity and the free
water compartment as well as and reductions in fractional anisotropy. However,
studies examining nigral diffusivity changes from PD with single-compartment
models have yielded inconclusive results and emerging evidence in control
subjects indicates that iron corrupts diffusivity metrics derived from
single-compartment models.
  Iron-sensitive data and diffusion data were analyzed in two cohorts. The
effect of iron on diffusion measures from single- and bi-compartment models was
assessed in both cohorts.
  Measures sensitive to the free water compartment and iron content were found
to increase in substantia nigra of the PD group in both cohorts. However,
diffusion markers derived from the single-compartment model were not replicated
across cohorts. Correlations were seen between single-compartment diffusion
measures and iron markers in the discovery cohort and validation cohort but no
correlation was observed between a measure from the bi-compartment model
related to the free water compartment and iron markers in either cohort.
  The variability of single-compartment nigral diffusion metrics in PD may be
attributed to competing influences of increased iron content, which drives
diffusivity down, and increases in the free water compartment, which drives
diffusivity up. In contrast to diffusion metrics derived from the
single-compartment model, no relationship was seen between iron and the free
water compartment in substantia nigra.

V1047~Cen, which hosted a classical nova eruption in 2005. The peculiar
outburst occurred 14 years after the classical nova event and lasted for more
than 400 days, reaching an amplitude of around 6 magnitudes in the optical.
Early spectral follow-up revealed what could be a dwarf nova (accretion disk
instability) outburst. However, the outburst duration, high velocity
($>$2000\,km\,s$^{-1}$) features in the optical line profiles, luminous optical
emission, and presence of prominent long-lasting radio emission together
suggest a phenomenon more exotic and energetic than a dwarf nova outburst. The
outburst amplitude, radiated energy, and spectral evolution are also not
consistent with a classical nova eruption. There are similarities between
V1047~Cen's 2019 outburst and those of classical symbiotic stars, but pre-2005
images of the field of V1047~Cen indicate that the system likely hosts a dwarf
companion, implying a typical cataclysmic variable system. Based on our
multi-wavelength observations, we suggest that the outburst may have started
with a brightening of the disk due to enhanced mass transfer or disk
instability, possibly leading to enhanced nuclear shell burning on the white
dwarf, which was already experiencing some level of quasi-steady shell burning.
This eventually led to the generation of a wind and/or bipolar, collimated
outflows. The 2019 outburst of V1047~Cen appears to be unique, and nothing
similar has been observed in a typical cataclysmic variable system before,
hinting at a potentially new astrophysical phenomenon.

target style. Despite there being a number of style tasks with available data,
there has been limited systematic discussion of how text style datasets relate
to each other. This understanding, however, is likely to have implications for
selecting multiple data sources for model training. While it is prudent to
consider inherent stylistic properties when determining these relationships, we
also must consider how a style is realized in a particular dataset. In this

Based on our results, we propose a categorization of stylistic and dataset
properties to consider when utilizing or comparing text style datasets.

results to customers. Typically, the websites log the customer search events,
which include the query entered and the resulting engagement with the shopping
results, such as clicks and purchases. Each customer search event serves as
input training data for the models, and the individual customer engagement
serves as a signal for customer preference. So a purchased shopping result, for
example, is perceived to be more important than one that is not. However, new
or under-impressed products do not have enough customer engagement signals and
end up at a disadvantage when being ranked alongside popular products. In this
paper, we propose a novel method for data curation that aggregates all customer
engagements within a day for the same query to use as input training data. This
aggregated customer engagement gives the models a complete picture of the
relative importance of shopping results. Training models on this aggregated
data leads to less reliance on behavioral features. This helps mitigate the
cold start problem and boosted relevant new products to top search results. In
this paper, we present the offline and online analysis and results comparing
the individual and aggregated customer engagement models trained on e-commerce

cryogenic facility developed for the CUORE experiment are highlighted. A brief
introduction of the evolution of the field and of the past cryogenic facilities

dimensions of a 3D (spatial-channel) tensor in a convolutional neural network

Specifically, we demonstrate that positional information is encoded based on
the ordering of the channel dimensions, while semantic information is largely
not. Following this demonstration, we show the real world impact of these
findings by applying them to two applications. First, we propose a simple yet
effective data augmentation strategy and loss function which improves the
translation invariance of a CNN's output. Second, we propose a method to
efficiently determine which channels in the latent representation are
responsible for (i) encoding overall position information or (ii)
region-specific positions. We first show that semantic segmentation has a
significant reliance on the overall position channels to make predictions. We
then show for the first time that it is possible to perform a `region-specific'
attack, and degrade a network's performance in a particular part of the input.
We believe our findings and demonstrated applications will benefit research

sustainable societies? To examine the link between these concepts, we propose
an econophysics asset exchange model with the surplus stock of the wealthy. The
wealthy are one of the two exchange agents and have more assets than the poor.
Our simulation model converts the surplus contribution rate of the wealthy to a
new variable parameter alongside the saving rate and introduces the total
exchange (flow) and rank correlation coefficient (metabolism) as new evaluation
indexes, adding to the Gini index (disparities), thereby assessing both wealth
distribution and the relationships among the disparities, flow, and metabolism.
We show that these result in a gamma-like wealth distribution, and our model
reveals a trade-off between limiting disparities and vitalizing the market. To
limit disparities and increase flow and metabolism, we also find the need to
restrain savings and use the wealthy surplus stock. This relationship is
explicitly expressed in the new equation introduced herein. The insights gained
by uncovering the root of disparities may present a persuasive case for
investments in social security measures or social businesses involving stock

address this challenge by decomposing filters, adapted to each spatial

However, the computational cost of most existing hypergraph-based algorithms

applied for preprocessing a given hypergraph by aggressively aggregating its
vertices (nodes). However, state-of-the-art hypergraph partitioning

In this work, we propose an efficient spectral hypergraph coarsening scheme

divide-and-conquer scheme by leveraging spectral clustering of the bipartite
graphs corresponding to the original hypergraphs. Our experimental results for
a variety of hypergraphs extracted from real-world VLSI design benchmarks show
that the proposed hypergraph coarsening algorithm can significantly improve the

tiled by translations of $F_1,F_2$. In particular, this implies that this
tiling problem is aperiodic, in the sense that (in the standard universe of
ZFC) there exist translational tilings of $E$ by the tiles $F_1,F_2$, but no
periodic tilings. Previously, such aperiodic or undecidable translational
tilings were only constructed for sets of eleven or more tiles (mostly in
$\mathbb{Z}^2$). A similar construction also applies for $G = \mathbb{Z}^d$ for
sufficiently large $d$. If one allows the group $G_0$ to be non-abelian, a
variant of the construction produces an undecidable translational tiling with
only one tile $F$.
  The argument proceeds by first observing that a single tiling equation is
able to encode an arbitrary system of tiling equations, which in turn can
encode an arbitrary system of certain functional equations once one has two or
more tiles. In particular, one can use two tiles to encode tiling problems for
an arbitrary number of tiles.

adequate real and virtual illumination composition in real-time. Estimating the
lighting of a real scenario is still a challenge. Due to the ill-posed nature
of the problem, classical inverse-rendering techniques tackle the problem for
simple lighting setups. However, those assumptions do not satisfy the current
state-of-art in computer graphics and XR applications. While many recent works
solve the problem using machine learning techniques to estimate the environment
light and scene's materials, most of them are limited to geometry or previous
knowledge. This paper presents a CNN-based model to estimate complex lighting
for mixed reality environments with no previous information about the scene. We
model the environment illumination using a set of spherical harmonics (SH)
environment lighting, capable of efficiently represent area lighting. We
propose a new CNN architecture that inputs an RGB image and recognizes, in
real-time, the environment lighting. Unlike previous CNN-based lighting
estimation methods, we propose using a highly optimized deep neural network
architecture, with a reduced number of parameters, that can learn high complex
lighting scenarios from real-world high-dynamic-range (HDR) environment images.
We show in the experiments that the CNN architecture can predict the
environment lighting with an average mean squared error (MSE) of \num{7.85e-04}
when comparing SH lighting coefficients. We validate our model in a variety of
mixed reality scenarios. Furthermore, we present qualitative results comparing
relights of real-world scenes.

proving the so-called propagation of chaos, which links the stochastic

that magnetic flux tubes can be heated by Alfv'en wave turbulence or by

being asymptotically flat(Schwarzschild Wormholes) that the radial energy
conditions are satisfied at the throat, depending on the chosen values for its
radius $r_0$. In contrast, in the general Schwarzschild-like case, there is no
possibility of the energy conditions being satisfied nearby the throat, as in
the usual case. After that, we calculate the radial state parameter,
$\omega(r)$, in $r_0$, in order to verify what type of cosmologic matter is
allowed at the wormhole throat, and we show that in both cases there is the
possibility of the presence of exotic matter, phantom or quintessence-like
matter. Finally, we give the $\omega(r)$ solutions for all regions of space.
Interestingly, we find that Schwarzschild-like Wormholes with excess of solid
angle of the sphere in the asymptotic limit have the possibility of having
non-exotic matter as source for certain values of the radial coordinate $r$.
Furthermore, it was observed that quantum gravity corrections due the ASG
necessarily imply regions with phantom-like matter, both for Schwarzschild and
for Schwarzschild-like wormholes. This reinforces the supposition that a
phantom fluid is always present for wormholes in this context.

several challenging datasets and fosters successful real-world applications,
even showing high robustness to the illumination variation that is usually
regarded as a main threat to the FR system. However, in the real world,
illumination variation caused by diverse lighting conditions cannot be fully
covered by the limited face dataset. In this paper, we study the threat of
lighting against FR from a new angle, i.e., adversarial attack, and identify a
new task, i.e., adversarial relighting. Given a face image, adversarial
relighting aims to produce a naturally relighted counterpart while fooling the
state-of-the-art deep FR methods. To this end, we first propose the physical
modelbased adversarial relighting attack (ARA) denoted as albedoquotient-based
adversarial relighting attack (AQ-ARA). It generates natural adversarial light
under the physical lighting model and guidance of FR systems and synthesizes
adversarially relighted face images. Moreover, we propose the auto-predictive
adversarial relighting attack (AP-ARA) by training an adversarial relighting
network (ARNet) to automatically predict the adversarial light in a one-step
manner according to different input faces, allowing efficiency-sensitive
applications. More importantly, we propose to transfer the above digital
attacks to physical ARA (PhyARA) through a precise relighting device, making
the estimated adversarial lighting condition reproducible in the real world. We
validate our methods on three state-of-the-art deep FR methods, i.e., FaceNet,
ArcFace, and CosFace, on two public datasets. The extensive and insightful
results demonstrate our work can generate realistic adversarial relighted face
images fooling face recognition tasks easily, revealing the threat of specific

force-velocity relation, we have studied the stochastic dynamics of a Brownian
particle in the presence of a linear velocity dependent force,
$f_s(1-\frac{v}{v_0})$ where $f_{s}$ is a constant. The position and velocity
auto correlation functions in different situations of the dynamics are
calculated exactly. We observed that the velocity auto correlation function
shows an exponentially decaying behaviour with time and saturates to a constant
value in the time asymptotic limit, for a fixed $f_s$. It attains saturation
faster with increase in the $f_{s}$ value. When the particle is confined in a
harmonic well, the spectral density exhibits a symmetric behaviour and the
corresponding velocity auto correlation function shows a damped oscillatory
behaviour before decaying to zero in the long time limit. With viscous
coefficient, a non-systematic variation of the velocity auto correlation
function is observed. Further, in the presence of a sinusoidal driving force,
the correlation in velocities increases with increase in the amplitude of
driving in the transient regime. For the particle confined in a harmonic well,
the correlation corresponding to the shift relative to the average position is
basically the thermal contribution to the total position correlation. Moreover,
in the athermal regime, the total correlation is entirely due to the velocity

reserving. However, such applications have focused primarily on the (important)
problem of fitting accurate central estimates of the outstanding claims. In
practice, properties regarding the variability of outstanding claims are
equally important (e.g., quantiles for regulatory purposes).
  In this paper we fill this gap by applying a Mixture Density Network (""MDN"")
to loss reserving. The approach combines a neural network architecture with a
mixture Gaussian distribution to achieve simultaneously an accurate central
estimate along with flexible distributional choice. Model fitting is done using
a rolling-origin approach. Our approach consistently outperforms the classical
over-dispersed model both for central estimates and quantiles of interest, when
applied to a wide range of simulated environments of various complexity and
specifications.
  We further extend the MDN approach by proposing two extensions. Firstly, we
present a hybrid GLM-MDN approach called ""ResMDN"". This hybrid approach
balances the tractability and ease of understanding of a traditional GLM model
on one hand, with the additional accuracy and distributional flexibility
provided by the MDN on the other. We show that it can successfully improve the
errors of the baseline ccODP, although there is generally a loss of performance
when compared to the MDN in the examples we considered. Secondly, we allow for
explicit projection constraints, so that actuarial judgement can be directly
incorporated in the modelling process.
  Throughout, we focus on aggregate loss triangles, and show that our
methodologies are tractable, and that they out-perform traditional approaches

validate properties, and real data -- to illustrate and ascertain practicality

features: (i) a privacy-preserving multi-source feature encoding for model
initialization; and (ii) table similarity aware weighting strategies to
aggregate local models for countering data skew. We extensively evaluate the
proposed Fed-TGAN against variants of decentralized learning architectures on

retrieval-based personalized chatbot model, namely IMPChat, to learn an
implicit user profile from the user's dialogue history. We argue that the
implicit user profile is superior to the explicit user profile regarding
accessibility and flexibility. IMPChat aims to learn an implicit user profile
through modeling user's personalized language style and personalized

elaborately build language models from shallow to deep using the user's
historical responses; To model a user's personalized preferences, we explore
the conditional relations underneath each post-response pair of the user. The
personalized preferences are dynamic and context-aware: we assign higher
weights to those historical pairs that are topically related to the current
query when aggregating the personalized preferences. We match each response
candidate with the personalized language style and personalized preference,
respectively, and fuse the two matching signals to determine the final ranking
score. Comprehensive experiments on two large datasets show that our method
outperforms all baseline models.

a possible RND for modeling European options prices under Heston's (1993)
stochastic volatility (SV) model. This distribution is seen as especially
useful in situations in which the spot's price follows a negatively skewed
distribution and hence, Black-Scholes based (i.e. the log-normal distribution)
modeling is largely inapt. We apply the GG distribution as RND to modeling
current market option data on three large market-index ETFs, namely the SPY,
IWM and QQQ as well as on the TLT (an ETF that tracks an index of long term US
Treasury bonds). The current option chain of each of the three market-index
ETFs shows of a pronounced skew of their volatility `smile' which indicates a
likely distortion in the Black-Scholes modeling of such option data. Reflective
of entirely different market expectations, this distortion appears not to exist
in the TLT option data. We provide a thorough modeling of the available option
data we have on each ETF (with the October 15, 2021 expiration) based on the GG

directly from a well-calibrated Heston's (1993) SV model (both theoretically

market-index ETFs exhibit negatively skewed distributions which are
well-matched with those derived under the GG distribution as RND. The
inadequacy of the Black-Scholes modeling in such instances which involve
negatively skewed distribution is further illustrated by its impact on the
hedging factor, delta, and the immediate implications to the retail trader. In
contrast, for the TLT ETF, which exhibits no such distortion to the volatility

limitation of matching algorithms, the pixel disparity accuracy usually suffers
the most at those object boundary areas. Although statistically the total

overtakes corona contribution as increasing multiplicity above $\langle

And the reference space is optimized to capture deep image priors that are

  Risk Assessment",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reducing the number of failures in a production system is one of the most
challenging problems in technology driven industries, such as, the online
retail industry. To address this challenge, change management has emerged as a
promising sub-field in operations that manages and reviews the changes to be
deployed in production in a systematic manner. However, it is practically
impossible to manually review a large number of changes on a daily basis and
assess the risk associated with them. This warrants the development of an
automated system to assess the risk associated with a large number of changes.
There are a few commercial solutions available to address this problem but
those solutions lack the ability to incorporate domain knowledge and continuous
feedback from domain experts into the risk assessment process. As part of this
work, we aim to bridge the gap between model-driven risk assessment of change
requests and the assessment of domain experts by building a continuous feedback
loop into the risk assessment process. Here we present our work to build an
end-to-end machine learning system along with the discussion of some of
practical challenges we faced related to extreme skewness in class
distribution, concept drift, estimation of the uncertainty associated with the
model's prediction and the overall scalability of the system.

which is widely used to determine radiative cooling potentials, does not
account for the cooling potential arising from heat loss to the colder reaches
of the atmosphere itself. Here, we show that use of the approximation can lead
to > 10% underestimation of the cooling potential relative to MODTRAN 6

approximation which accounts for heat loss to the cold upper atmosphere, and
significantly reduces this underestimation, while retaining the advantages of
the original model. In light of the widespread and continued use of the
transmittance-based model, our results highlight an important source of
potential errors and a means to correct for them.

absorb energy. For the subset allocation, we propose policies obtained as

the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver without violating the RIS's

to maximize the RIS harvested power, while ensuring an acceptable SNR at the

that the RIS power-consumption demands can be secured by harvesting energy from

Recently, several works proposed to use generative models for generating

accurate encoding and decoding are critical, these methods, which use

to pilot studies on small datasets.
  Exploiting the exactly reversible encoder-decoder structure of normalizing

unsupervised data augmentations. We demonstrate that such perturbations match
the performance of advanced data augmentation techniques -- reaching 96.6% test
accuracy for CIFAR-10 using ResNet-18 and outperform existing methods,
particularly in low data regimes -- yielding 10--25% relative improvement of

due to the label noise and privacy issues. Meanwhile, existing face recognition
datasets are usually collected from web images, lacking detailed annotations on
attributes (e.g., pose and expression), so the influences of different
attributes on face recognition have been poorly investigated. In this paper, we
address the above-mentioned issues in face recognition using synthetic face
images, i.e., SynFace. Specifically, we first explore the performance gap
between recent state-of-the-art face recognition models trained with synthetic

performance gap, e.g., the poor intra-class variations and the domain gap
between synthetic and real face images. Inspired by this, we devise the SynFace
with identity mixup (IM) and domain mixup (DM) to mitigate the above
performance gap, demonstrating the great potentials of synthetic data for face
recognition. Furthermore, with the controllable face synthesis model, we can
easily manage different factors of synthetic face generation, including pose,
expression, illumination, the number of identities, and samples per identity.
Therefore, we also perform a systematically empirical analysis on synthetic
face images to provide some insights on how to effectively utilize synthetic

policy lookup tables in systems such as the Airborne Collision Avoidance System

verification techniques. The problem of analyzing ACAS Xu networks has
motivated many successful neural network verifiers. These verifiers typically
analyze the internal computation of neural networks to decide whether a
property regarding the input/output holds. The intrinsic complexity of neural
network computation renders such verifiers slow to run and vulnerable to
floating-point error.
  This paper revisits the original problem of verifying ACAS Xu networks. The
networks take low-dimensional sensory inputs with training data provided by a
precomputed lookup table. We propose to prepend an input quantization layer to
the network. Quantization allows efficient verification via input state
enumeration, whose complexity is bounded by the size of the quantization space.
Quantization is equivalent to nearest-neighbor interpolation at run time, which
has been shown to provide acceptable accuracy for ACAS in simulation. Moreover,
our technique can deliver exact verification results immune to floating-point
error if we directly enumerate the network outputs on the target inference
implementation or on an accurate simulation of the target implementation.

neural networks against adversarial attacks. While being able to bring reliable
robustness, adversarial training (AT) methods in general favor high capacity
models, i.e., the larger the model the better the robustness. This tends to
limit their effectiveness on small models, which are more preferable in
scenarios where storage or computing resources are very limited (e.g., mobile
devices). In this paper, we leverage the concept of knowledge distillation to
improve the robustness of small models by distilling from adversarially trained
large models. We first revisit several state-of-the-art AT methods from a
distillation perspective and identify one common technique that can lead to
improved robustness: the use of robust soft labels -- predictions of a robust
model. Following this observation, we propose a novel adversarial robustness
distillation method called Robust Soft Label Adversarial Distillation (RSLAD)
to train robust small student models. RSLAD fully exploits the robust soft
labels produced by a robust (adversarially-trained) large teacher model to
guide the student's learning on both natural and adversarial examples in all
loss terms. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our RSLAD approach

robustness of small models against state-of-the-art attacks including the
AutoAttack. We also provide a set of understandings on our RSLAD and the

(EoR). We show that the axion as the dominant dark matter component has a
significant impact on the reionization history due to the suppression of small
scale density perturbations in the early universe. This behavior depends
strongly on the mass of the axion particle.
  Using numerical simulations of the brightness temperature field of neutral
hydrogen over a large redshift range, we construct a suite of training data.
This data is used to train a convolutional neural network that can build a
connection between the spatial structures of the brightness temperature field
and the input axion mass directly. We construct mock observations of the future
Square Kilometer Array survey, SKA1-Low, and find that even in the presence of
realistic noise and resolution constraints, the network is still able to
predict the input axion mass. We find that the axion mass can be recovered over
a wide mass range with a precision of approximately 20\%, and as the whole DM
contribution, the axion can be detected using SKA1-Low at 68\% if the axion
mass is $M_X<1.86 \times10^{-20}$eV although this can decrease to $M_X<5.25
\times10^{-21}$eV if we relax our assumptions on the astrophysical modeling by
treating those astrophysical parameters as nuisance parameters.

widely explored for the speaker verification system. For example, RawNet and
RawNet2 extracted speaker's feature embeddings from waveforms automatically for
recognizing their voice, which can vastly reduce the front-end computation and

hierarchical way is also designed to enhance the intonation property from
coarse to fine to improve the system accuracy. The high-level intonation

three new scenarios, i.e., Dual-Target CDR (DTCDR), Multi-Target CDR (MTCDR),

more representative user and item embeddings. Then, we propose an element-wise
attention mechanism to effectively combine the embeddings of common entities

design of diffractive optical networks for the classification and
reconstruction of spatially overlapping, phase-encoded objects. When two
different phase-only objects spatially overlap, the individual object functions
are perturbed since their phase patterns are summed up. The retrieval of the
underlying phase images from solely the overlapping phase distribution presents
a challenging problem, the solution of which is generally not unique. We show
that through a task-specific training process, passive diffractive networks
composed of successive transmissive layers can all-optically and simultaneously
classify two different randomly-selected, spatially overlapping phase images at
the input. After trained with ~550 million unique combinations of phase-encoded
handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, our blind testing results reveal
that the diffractive network achieves an accuracy of >85.8% for all-optical
classification of two overlapping phase images of new handwritten digits. In
addition to all-optical classification of overlapping phase objects, we also
demonstrate the reconstruction of these phase images based on a shallow
electronic neural network that uses the highly compressed output of the
diffractive network as its input (with e.g., ~20-65 times less number of

  Framework","IPMI 2021",,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Domain shift happens in cross-domain scenarios commonly because of the wide
gaps between different domains: when applying a deep learning model
well-trained in one domain to another target domain, the model usually performs
poorly. To tackle this problem, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques
are proposed to bridge the gap between different domains, for the purpose of
improving model performance without annotation in the target domain.
Particularly, UDA has a great value for multimodal medical image analysis,
where annotation difficulty is a practical concern. However, most existing UDA
methods can only achieve satisfactory improvements in one adaptation direction
(e.g., MRI to CT), but often perform poorly in the other (CT to MRI), limiting
their practical usage. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional UDA (BiUDA)
framework based on disentangled representation learning for equally competent
two-way UDA performances. This framework employs a unified domain-aware pattern
encoder which not only can adaptively encode images in different domains
through a domain controller, but also improve model efficiency by eliminating
redundant parameters. Furthermore, to avoid distortion of contents and patterns
of input images during the adaptation process, a content-pattern consistency
loss is introduced. Additionally, for better UDA segmentation performance, a
label consistency strategy is proposed to provide extra supervision by
recomposing target-domain-styled images and corresponding source-domain
annotations. Comparison experiments and ablation studies conducted on two
public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our BiUDA framework to current
state-of-the-art UDA methods and the effectiveness of its novel designs. By
successfully addressing two-way adaptations, our BiUDA framework offers a
flexible solution of UDA techniques to the real-world scenario.

representations and thus it is lacking of feature diversity, such as the
descriptions related to speaker characteristics. To address this issue, this
paper proposed a novel multi-level acoustic feature extraction framework that
can be easily combined with Transformer based ASR models. The framework
consists of two input streams: a shallow stream with high-resolution
spectrograms and a deep stream with low-resolution spectrograms. The shallow
stream is used to acquire traditional shallow features that is beneficial for
the classification of phones or words while the deep stream is used to obtain
utterance-level speaker-invariant deep features for improving the feature
diversity. A feature correlation based fusion strategy is used to aggregate
both features across the frequency and time domains and then fed into the
Transformer encoder-decoder module. By using the proposed multi-level acoustic
feature extraction framework, state-of-the-art word error rate of 21.7% and

excess fuel consumption, failure of missile trajectory or mechanical parts, and
aerodynamic heating. We conduct numerical simulations to investigate the flow
and compare our results to existing experimental data to show quantitative

based on the equivalence forms, we develop optimization algorithm, named
ApproxMPOT algorithm, that builds upon the Sinkhorn algorithm for solving the
entropic regularized multimarginal optimal transport. We demonstrate that the

In highLy interactive envirONments (EPSILON). EPSILON is an efficient
interaction-aware planning system for automated driving, and is extensively
validated in both simulation and real-world dense city traffic. It follows a
hierarchical structure with an interactive behavior planning layer and an
optimization-based motion planning layer. The behavior planning is formulated
from a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), but is much more
efficient than naively applying a POMDP to the decision-making problem. The key
to efficiency is guided branching in both the action space and observation
space, which decomposes the original problem into a limited number of
closed-loop policy evaluations. Moreover, we introduce a new driver model with
a safety mechanism to overcome the risk induced by the potential imperfectness
of prior knowledge. For motion planning, we employ a spatio-temporal semantic
corridor (SSC) to model the constraints posed by complex driving environments
in a unified way. Based on the SSC, a safe and smooth trajectory is optimized,
complying with the decision provided by the behavior planner. We validate our
planning system in both simulations and real-world dense traffic, and the
experimental results show that our EPSILON achieves human-like driving
behaviors in highly interactive traffic flow smoothly and safely without being
over-conservative compared to the existing planning methods.

eruptions first identified in the 1960s, where erupting magma at an air-water
interface interacts with large quantities of slurry, a mixture of previously
ejected tephra that re-enters the crater together with water. During a
Surtseyan eruption, hot magma bombs are ejected that initially contain pockets
of slurry. Despite the formation of steam and anticipated subsequent high
pressures inside these bombs, many survive to land without exploding. We seek
to explain this by building and solving a simplified spherical mathematical
model that describes the coupled evolution of pressure and temperature due to
the flashing of liquid to vapour within a Surtseyan bomb while it is in flight.
Analysis of the model provides a criterion for fragmentation of the bomb due to
steam pressure buildup, and predicts that if diffusive steam flow through the
porous bomb is sufficiently rapid, the bomb will survive the flight intact.
This criterion explicitly relates fragmentation to bomb properties, and
describes how a Surtseyan bomb can survive in flight despite containing
flashing liquid water, contributing to an ongoing discussion in volcanology

existing solutions that are based upon estimate and plug methods, we propose an
approximation of the generalized likelihood ratio test where the maximizers of
the likelihoods are obtained through an alternating estimation procedure.
Remarkably, we also prove that such estimation procedure leads to an
architecture possessing the constant false alarm rate (CFAR) when a specific
initialization is used. The performance analysis, carried out on simulated as
well as measured data and in comparison with suitable well-known competitors,
highlights that the proposed architecture can overcome the CFAR competitors and
exhibits a limited loss with respect to the other non-CFAR detectors.

alleviating the intensive workload of manual annotation by aligning the

Unfortunately, mapping the target-domain distribution to the source-domain

target-domain data. To this end, we firstly propose to introduce a novel
multi-anchor based active learning strategy to assist domain adaptation
regarding the semantic segmentation task. By innovatively adopting multiple
anchors instead of a single centroid, the source domain can be better
characterized as a multimodal distribution, thus more representative and
complimentary samples are selected from the target domain. With little workload
to manually annotate these active samples, the distortion of the target-domain
distribution can be effectively alleviated, resulting in a large performance
gain. The multi-anchor strategy is additionally employed to model the
target-distribution. By regularizing the latent representation of the target
samples compact around multiple anchors through a novel soft alignment loss,
more precise segmentation can be achieved. Extensive experiments are conducted
on public datasets to demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods significantly, along with thorough ablation study to

The 54 astronomical images chosen by a scientific committee, categorised in
three different topics (night landscape, deep sky, instrumentation), were seen
by more than 2000 visitors and 11 school groups (despite the difficult period
due to the COVID pandemic). A free audio-guide, available on-line through a
web-application developed on purpose, delivered scientific explanations of
images for self-guided tours. Conferences and guided tours were also organized.

sticking forces between micrometer grains of chondritic composition. The data
showed a decrease in surface energy by a factor ~5 with increasing temperature.
Here, we focus on the effect of surface water on grains. Under ambient
conditions in the laboratory, multiple water layers are present. At the low
pressure of protoplanetary discs and for moderate temperatures, grains likely
only hold a monolayer. As dust drifts inwards, even this monolayer eventually
evaporates completely in higher temperature regions. To account for this, we
measured the tensile strength for the same chondritic material as was prepared
and measured under normal laboratory conditions in our previous work, but now
introducing two new preparation methods: drying dust cylinders in air (dry
samples), and heating dust pressed into cylinders in vacuum (super-dry
samples). For all temperatures up to 1000 K, the data of the dry samples are
consistent with a simple increase in the sticking force by a factor of ~10 over
wet samples. Up to 900 K super-dry samples behave like dry samples. However,
the sticking forces then exponentially increase up to another factor ~100 at
about 1200 K. The increase in sticking from wet to dry extends a trend that is
known for amorphous silicates to multimineral mixtures. The findings for
super-dry dust imply that aggregate growth is boosted in a small spatial
high-temperature region around 1200 K, which might be a sweet spot for
planetesimal formation.

the use of position-dependent weighting scheme that reduces the influence of
nearby galaxies, which are typically overrepresented relative to the more
distant galaxies in most surveys. We demonstrate that the correlation functions
calculated this way are less susceptible to biases due to our particular
location in the Universe, and thus are more easily comparable to linear theory
and between surveys. Our results suggest that the parallel velocity correlation
function is a promising cosmological probe, given that it provides a better
approximation of a Gaussian distribution than other velocity correlation
functions and that its bias is more easily minimized by weighting. Though the
position weighted parallel velocity correlation function increases the
statistical uncertainty, it decreases the cosmic variance and is expected to
provide more stable and tighter cosmological parameter constraints than other
correlation methods in conjunction with more precise velocity surveys in the

design an auxiliary loop via self-distillation with three orderly arranged

set Final Slot Decoder as the teacher model that imparts knowledge back to
Initial Slot Decoder to complete the loop. The auxiliary loop enables intents

results for dynamic independent set in a wide variety of geometric settings,
such as disks, fat polygons, and their high-dimensional equivalents.
  Our result is obtained via a two-level approach. First, we develop a dynamic
data structure which stores all objects and provides an approximate independent
set when queried, with output-sensitive running time. We show that via standard
methods such a structure can be used to obtain a dynamic algorithm with
\textit{amortized} update time bounds. Then, to obtain worst-case update time
algorithms, we develop a generic deamortization scheme that with each
insertion/deletion keeps (i) the update time bounded and (ii) the number of
changes in the independent set constant. We show that such a scheme is
applicable to fat objects by showing an appropriate generalization of a
separator theorem.
  Interestingly, we show that our deamortization scheme is also necessary in
order to obtain worst-case update bounds: If for a class of objects our scheme
is not applicable, then no constant-factor approximation with sublinear
worst-case update time is possible. We show that such a lower bound applies
even for seemingly simple classes of geometric objects including axis-aligned
rectangles in the plane.

accelerating the RRT*'s convergence rate. The most successful strategies are
informed sampling, path optimisation, and a combination thereof. However,
informed sampling and its combination with path optimisation have not been

ascertain if applying informed sampling and path optimisation can help the

described via manifolds, such as spheres, tori, and other implicit surfaces.
Current extensions of existing (Euclidean) generative models are restricted to
specific geometries and typically suffer from high computational costs. We
introduce Moser Flow (MF), a new class of generative models within the family
of continuous normalizing flows (CNF). MF also produces a CNF via a solution to
the change-of-variable formula, however differently from other CNF methods, its
model (learned) density is parameterized as the source (prior) density minus
the divergence of a neural network (NN). The divergence is a local, linear
differential operator, easy to approximate and calculate on manifolds.
Therefore, unlike other CNFs, MF does not require invoking or backpropagating
through an ODE solver during training. Furthermore, representing the model
density explicitly as the divergence of a NN rather than as a solution of an
ODE facilitates learning high fidelity densities. Theoretically, we prove that
MF constitutes a universal density approximator under suitable assumptions.
Empirically, we demonstrate for the first time the use of flow models for
sampling from general curved surfaces and achieve significant improvements in
density estimation, sample quality, and training complexity over existing CNFs

jet is aligned close to the line of sight. Blazars emission is dominated by
non-thermal processes, where Doppler boosted radiation originates from a
relativistic population of charged particles within the jet. From radio to TeV
energies, blazars are highly variable on timescales from minutes to several
months. There are several mechanisms proposed to explain variability, including
changes in the viewing angle of the jet, propagating along the rotation axis of
the accretion disc. The misalignment of a supermassive black hole (SMBH) spin
and the angular momentum of the accretion disc yields to Lense-Thirring
precession of such tilted disc, which leads to the variation of Doppler
beaming. Such scenario is supported by radio observations of jet precession
observed in some AGNs. The radio-emitting regions, however, are located far
from the central engine, and thus the observed time scales in this band can be
affected by e.g. a variation of the bulk Lorentz factor along the jet. In this
contribution, we derive expected time scales of the jet wobbling using SMBH
masses and compare them with the time intervals between flares in long-term
(over 15 years) X-ray light curves of bright blazars observed by Swift-XRT. We
found that for Mrk 421, Mrk 501 and 3C 273, the derived time scales are
consistent with the observational constraints, while for 1ES 1959+650 we are
mostly limited by uncertainty in the Doppler beaming factor.

between the dark sectors impact significantly dark matter observables, they
allow in particular to significantly relax the direct detection constraints on
the model. To determine the parameter space that satisfies relic density,
theoretical and collider constraints as well as direct and indirect detection
limits, we perform two separate scans, the first includes the full parameter
space of the model while the second is dedicated to scenarios with a compressed
inert doublet spectrum. In the first case we find that the singlet is generally
the dominant dark matter component while in the compressed case the doublet is
more likely to be the dominant dark matter component. In both cases we find
that the two dark matter particles can have masses that ranges from around

occupy a few pixels in the images, and the models are required to
simultaneously learn object locations and detection. Even though the
established approaches well perform for the objects of regular sizes, they
achieve weak performance when analyzing small ones or getting stuck in the
local minima (e.g. false object parts). Two possible issues stand in their way.
First, the existing methods struggle to perform stably on the detection of
small objects because of the complicated background. Second, most of the
standard methods used hand-crafted features, and do not work well on the
detection of objects parts of which are missing. We here address the above
issues and propose a new architecture with a multiple patch feature pyramid
network (MPFP-Net). Different from the current models that during training only
pursue the most discriminative patches, in MPFPNet the patches are divided into
class-affiliated subsets, in which the patches are related and based on the
primary loss function, a sequence of smooth loss functions are determined for
the subsets to improve the model for collecting small object parts. To enhance
the feature representation for patch selection, we introduce an effective
method to regularize the residual values and make the fusion transition layers
strictly norm-preserving. The network contains bottom-up and crosswise
connections to fuse the features of different scales to achieve better
accuracy, compared to several state-of-the-art object detection models. Also,
the developed architecture is more efficient than the baselines.

of BGK model of the Boltzmann equation and Poisson equations. The background is
characterized by a comoving Maxwellian distribution function and a space-time
Newtonian gravitational potential which satisfy the BGK model of the Boltzmann
and Poisson equations without the necessity to invoke ""Jeans swindle"". The
perturbations of the distribution function and Newtonian gravitational
potentials from their background states are represented by plane waves of small
amplitudes and a differential equation for the density contrast is determined.
The density contrast differential equation was solved numerically and it is
shown: (i) Jeans instability is characterized by perturbation wavelengths
larger than Jeans wavelength where the density contrast grows with time. The
growth of the density contrast is less accentuated for the case where the
particle collisions are considered due to an energy dissipation; (ii) for
perturbation wavelengths smaller than Jeans wavelength the density contrast has
an oscillatory behavior in time and the oscillations for the case where the
collisions are taken into account fade away in time due to the energy
dissipation.

Particle physicists have predicted the possible collision and pair annihilation
of two magnetic charges with opposite signs. However, if such annihilation

linearly polarized light. This photoinduced pair annihilation is accompanied by
a non-topological phase transition to the Floquet normal insulator phase in

transition to the Floquet Chern insulator phase. We discuss that
$\alpha$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$I$_3$ has a peculiar band structure capable of realizing
a suitable experimental condition (i.e., off-resonant condition) and a charge
ordered state providing a required staggered site potential and thereby
provides a rare example of materials that can be used to observe the predicted
pair annihilation phenomenon. The feasibility of experimental observation is

system is to provide a witnessing subsystem (also called critical subsystem)
for the property. Computing minimal witnessing subsystems is NP-hard already
for acyclic Markov chains, but can be done in polynomial time for Markov chains
whose underlying graph is a tree. This paper considers the problem for
probabilistic systems that are similar to trees or paths. It introduces the
parameters directed tree-partition width (dtpw) and directed path-partition
width (dppw) and shows that computing minimal witnesses remains NP-hard for
Markov chains with bounded dppw (and hence also for Markov chains with bounded
dtpw). By observing that graphs of bounded dtpw have bounded width with respect
to all known tree similarity measures for directed graphs, the hardness result
carries over to these other tree similarity measures. Technically, the
reduction proceeds via the conceptually simpler matrix-pair chain problem,
which is introduced and shown to be NP-complete for nonnegative matrices of
fixed dimension. Furthermore, an algorithm which aims to utilise a given
directed tree partition of the system to compute a minimal witnessing subsystem
is described. It enumerates partial subsystems for the blocks of the partition
along the tree order, and keeps only necessary ones. A preliminary experimental
analysis shows that it outperforms other approaches on certain benchmarks which
have directed tree partitions of small width.

ELEvoHI relies on heliospheric imagers (HI) observations to obtain the
kinematics of a CME. With the newly developed deformable front, the model is
able to react to the ambient solar wind conditions during the entire
propagation and along the whole front of the CME. To get an estimate of the
ambient solar wind conditions, we make use of three different models:
Heliospheric Upwind eXtrapolation model (HUX), Heliospheric Upwind
eXtrapolation with time dependence model (HUXt), and EUropean Heliospheric
FORecasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA). We test the deformable front on a CME
first observed in STEREO-A/HI on February 3, 2010 14:49 UT. For this case
study, the deformable front provides better estimates of the arrival time and
arrival speed than the original version of ELEvoHI using an elliptical front.
The new implementation enables us to study the parameters influencing the
propagation of the CME not only for the apex, but for the entire front. The
evolution of the CME front, especially at the flanks, is highly dependent on
the ambient solar wind model used. An additional advantage of the new
implementation is given by the possibility to provide estimates of the CME
mass.

properties such as anisotropy and non-linear stress-strain behaviour. They

foundations of the linear viscoelastic theory and the theory of Quasi-Linear
Viscoelasticity (QLV) in view of developing new methods to estimate the
viscoelastic properties of soft tissues through model fitting. To this aim, we
consider the simple torsion of a viscoelastic Mooney-Rivlin material in two
different testing scenarios: step-strain and ramp tests. These tests are
commonly performed to characterise the time-dependent properties of soft
tissues and allow to investigate their stress relaxation behaviour. Moreover,
commercial torsional rheometers measure both the torque and the normal force,
giving access to two sets of data. We show that for a step test, the linear and
the QLV models predict the same relaxation curves for the torque. However, when
the strain history is in the form of a ramp function, the non-linear terms
appearing in the QLV model affect the relaxation curve of the torque depending
on the final strain level and on the rising time of the ramp. Furthermore, our
results show that the relaxation curve of the normal force predicted by the QLV
theory depends on the level of strain both for a step and a ramp tests. To
quantify the effect of the non-linear terms, we evaluate the maximum and the
equilibrium values of the relaxation curves. Our results provide useful
guidelines to accurately fit QLV models in view of estimating the viscoelastic
properties of soft tissues.

control flow are important concerns in distributed systems integration.
Modularity is a fundamental principle in software design, in particular for
distributed system architectures. Modularity emphasizes high cohesion of
individual modules and low coupling between modules. Microservices are a recent
modularization approach with the specific requirements of independent
deployability and, in particular, decentralized data management. Cohesiveness
of microservices goes hand-in-hand with loose coupling, making the development,
deployment, and evolution of microservice architectures flexible and scalable.
However, in our experience with microservice architectures, interactions and
flows among microservices are usually more complex than in traditional,
monolithic enterprise systems, since services tend to be smaller and only have
one responsibility, causing collaboration needs. We suggest that for loose
coupling among microservices, explicit control-flow modeling and execution with
central workflow engines should be avoided on the application integration
level. On the level of integrating microservices, data-flow modeling should be
dominant. Control-flow should be secondary and preferably delegated to the
microservices. We discuss coupling in distributed systems integration and
reflect the history of business process modeling with respect to data and
control flow. To illustrate our recommendations, we present some results for
flow-based programming in our Industrial DevOps project Titan, where we employ

and $M_{1X}$ at the secondary $SU(5) \times U(1)_X$ unification scale in
$\cal{F}$-$SU(5)$ emanating from $SU(5)$ breaking and $U(1)_X$ flux effects.
Calculations unveil $\Delta a_{\mu}({\rm SUSY}) = 19.0 - 22.3 \times 10^{-10}$
for gluino masses of $M(\widetilde{g}) = 2.25 - 2.56$ TeV and higgsino dark
matter, aptly residing within the BNL+FNAL $1\sigma$ mean. This $(g - 2)_{\mu}$
favorable region of the model space also generates the correct light Higgs
boson mass and branching ratios of companion rare decay processes, and is
further consistent with all LHC Run 2 constraints. Finally, we examine the
heavy SUSY Higgs boson in light of recent LHC searches for an extended Higgs
sector.

antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice (KAFH), is a very
challenging problem on classical computers and only possible for relatively
small systems. We propose using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to
find the ground state of the KAFH on a quantum computer. We find efficient
ansatz circuits and show how physically interesting observables can be measured
efficiently. To investigate the expressiveness and scaling of our ansatz
circuits we used classical, exact simulations of VQE for the KAFH for different
lattices ranging from 8 to 24 qubits. We find that the fidelity with the ground
state approaches one exponentially in the circuit depth for all lattices
considered, except for a 24-qubit lattice with an almost degenerate ground
state. We conclude that VQE circuits that are able to represent the ground
state of the KAFH on lattices inaccessible to exact diagonalisation techniques
may be achievable on near term quantum hardware. However, for large systems
circuits with many variational parameters are needed to achieve high fidelity
with the ground state.

Existing ER approaches, due to insufficient feature discovery or error-prone

first phase, ALG is proposed to generate a set of positive tuple pairs and a
set of negative tuple pairs. ALG guarantees the high quality of the generated
tuples and hence ensures the training quality of the subsequent CERT. In the
second phase, CERT is introduced to learn the matching signals by discovering
graph features and sentence features of tuples collaboratively. Extensive
experimental results over eight real-world ER benchmarks show that CollaborER
outperforms all the existing unsupervised ER approaches and is comparable or

emojis do not always reduce commenting noise (i.e., eight out of 20 emoji
reactions), providing evidence that developers use emojis with ulterior

facilitate for a more efficient review process is unknown. Objective: In this

intentions and usages of emoji reactions, apart from reducing commenting noise
during the discussions in GitHub pull requests (PRs). As part of the report, we
first perform a preliminary analysis to whether emoji reactions can reduce

the formula $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\langle f, A_{n, \mathbf a} \rangle n^{-s},$ $s

an IRS-aided terahertz (THz) link, though, is the severe propagation losses at
high frequency bands. Hence, a THz IRS is expected to consist of a massive
number of reflecting elements to compensate for those losses. However, as the
IRS size grows, the conventional far-field assumption starts becoming invalid
and the spherical wavefront of the radiated waves must be taken into account.
In this work, we focus on the near-field and analytically determine the IRS
response in the Fresnel zone by leveraging electromagnetic theory.
Specifically, we derive a novel expression for the path loss and beampattern of
a holographic IRS, which is then used to model its discrete counterpart. Our

Recent knowledge tracing methods tend to respond to these challenges by
modelling knowledge state dynamics across learning concepts. However, they
still suffer from several inherent challenges including: modelling forgetting
behaviours and identifying relationships among latent concepts. To address
these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel knowledge tracing model,
namely \emph{Deep Graph Memory Network} (DGMN). In this model, we incorporate a
forget gating mechanism into an attention memory structure in order to capture
forgetting behaviours dynamically during the knowledge tracing process.
Particularly, this forget gating mechanism is built upon attention forgetting
features over latent concepts considering their mutual dependencies. Further,
this model has the capability of learning relationships between latent concepts
from a dynamic latent concept graph in light of a student's evolving knowledge
states. A comprehensive experimental evaluation has been conducted using four
well-established benchmark datasets. The results show that DGMN consistently
outperforms the state-of-the-art KT models over all the datasets. The
effectiveness of modelling forgetting behaviours and learning latent concept
graphs has also been analyzed in our experiments.

nowadays a common industrially relevant procedure. Till this day in the
scientific literature there is in general no mathematical convergence analysis
which explains the numerical success of GD type optimization schemes in the

regarded as temporal discretization methods for the gradient flow (GF)

in view of this, it seems to be a natural direction of research to first aim to
develop a mathematical convergence theory for time-continuous GF differential
equations and, thereafter, to aim to extend such a time-continuous convergence
theory to implementable time-discrete GD type optimization methods. In this
article we establish two basic results for GF differential equations in the
training of fully-connected feedforward ANNs with one hidden layer and ReLU
activation. In the first main result of this article we establish in the
training of such ANNs under the assumption that the probability distribution of
the input data of the considered supervised learning problem is absolutely
continuous with a bounded density function that every GF differential equation
admits for every initial value a solution which is also unique among a suitable
class of solutions. In the second main result of this article we prove in the
training of such ANNs under the assumption that the target function and the
density function of the probability distribution of the input data are
piecewise polynomial that every non-divergent GF trajectory converges with an
appropriate rate of convergence to a critical point and that the risk of the
non-divergent GF trajectory converges with rate 1 to the risk of the critical
point.

p-type topological crystalline insulator (TCI) SnTe, across the

temperature. The electrical resistivity of a well-characterized SnTe crystal
shows evidence for the cubic-to-rhombohedral structural transition at T$_s$
$\sim$64,K and a carrier density of $\sim$1.8$\times$10$^{20}$ at 77,K. As a
function of applied magnetic field perpendicular to the (100) plane, SnTe
exhibits a large unsaturated linear magnetoresistance (LMR) reaching a value of
42% at 5K and 8T. LMR is found to have a direct dependence on the mobility and
a detailed analysis shows that it follows the classical Parish-Littlewood model
of conductivity fluctuations arising from macroscopic inhomogeneity of
tellurium interstitial atoms. We also observe SdH oscillations in the
rhombohedral (R3m) phase with a Berry phase of $\pi$ and significantly lower
carrier density $\sim$5.32$\times$10$^{11}$cm$^{-2}$ at 2K, which provides
direct evidence of protected topological surface states in the (R3m) phase. The
Hall conductivity shows a transformation from one band to two-band behavior
across the structural transition, thus providing experimental evidence for the
degeneracy lifting of bulk valence bands below the cubic symmetry breaking
point which is consistent with recent band structure calculations. The overall
results indicate that magneto-transport studies can distinctly probe the
surface and bulk sensitive properties of SnTe, and can also track the
band-splitting of degenerate bands at the Fermi level across the

occlusion. However, especially for the estimation of the position and size of
fruits, it is necessary to avoid occlusions as much as possible and acquire
sensor information of the relevant parts. Global viewpoint planners exist that
suggest a series of viewpoints to cover the regions of interest up to a certain
degree, but they usually prioritize global coverage and do not emphasize the
avoidance of local occlusions. On the other hand, there are approaches that aim
at avoiding local occlusions, but they cannot be used in larger environments
since they only reach a local maximum of coverage. In this paper, we therefore
propose to combine a local, gradient-based method with global viewpoint
planning to enable local occlusion avoidance while still being able to cover
large areas. Our simulated experiments with a robotic arm equipped with a
camera array as well as an RGB-D camera show that this combination leads to a
significantly increased coverage of the regions of interest compared to just

and there is a certain irregularity, we call such a coloring \emph{crumby}.

Their prototype counterexample is $2$-connected, planar, but contains a

bipartite graphs. In this regard, we prove that $2$-connected outerplanar

wherein an input raw image is trained to imitate the target sRGB image captured
by another camera. However, the severe color inconsistency makes it very
challenging to generate well-aligned training pairs of input raw and target
sRGB images. While learning with inaccurately aligned supervision is prone to
causing pixel shift and producing blurry results. In this paper, we circumvent
such issue by presenting a joint learning model for image alignment and
RAW-to-sRGB mapping. To diminish the effect of color inconsistency in image
alignment, we introduce to use a global color mapping (GCM) module to generate
an initial sRGB image given the input raw image, which can keep the spatial
location of the pixels unchanged, and the target sRGB image is utilized to
guide GCM for converting the color towards it. Then a pre-trained optical flow
estimation network (e.g., PWC-Net) is deployed to warp the target sRGB image to
align with the GCM output. To alleviate the effect of inaccurately aligned
supervision, the warped target sRGB image is leveraged to learn RAW-to-sRGB
mapping. When training is done, the GCM module and optical flow network can be
detached, thereby bringing no extra computation cost for inference. Experiments
show that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-arts on ZRR and
SR-RAW datasets. With our joint learning model, a light-weight backbone can
achieve better quantitative and qualitative performance on ZRR dataset. Codes

of the interaction between the HI and the radio source. Our sample consists of
14 extended sources and 12 compact sources in the radio-power range
10$^{25.7}$W/Hz$~-~10^{26.5}$W/Hz. We detect HI in 5 sources with a detection
rate of $\sim$19%, similar to the detection rate at lower redshifts. The
rest-frame UV luminosities of most of the sources in the sample, including all
the detections, are below the proposed threshold above which the HI is supposed
to have been ionised. The optical emission-line spectra show that despite their
high radio powers, one-third of the sample, including two detections, are
low-ionisation sources. The radio continuum emission from the HI detections is
unresolved at kpc scales, but is extended on parsec scales. The detections have
complex HI 21cm absorption profiles with FWZI ranging from 60 km/s to 700 km/s
and exhibit remarkably high HI column densities in the range 10$^{21}$
cm$^{-2}$ to 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ for T$_{\rm spin}=$100 K and unit covering
factor. A modelling of the HI 21cm absorption profiles suggests that in 2
sources the gas is disturbed, and in 3 cases, including the one with disturbed
HI, the majority of the absorption is consistent with arising from an HI disc.
Though we detect no fast HI outflows, the optical emission lines in the HI
detections show the presence of highly disturbed gas in the nuclear region.
Since some of our detections are low-ionisation AGN, this disturbance may be
caused by the radio jets. Overall, our findings point towards a continuation of
the low-$z$ trends in the incidence of HI in radio AGN up to $z \sim 0.4$.

occurs in the cloud to edge nodes,e.g., CDN servers, in order to get closer to
the users and reduce latency. To improve performance even further, WebAssembly
is increasingly used in this context. Edge-cloud computing providers, such as
Fastly or Cloudflare, let their clients deploy stateless services in the form
of WebAssembly binaries, which are then translated to machine code and
sandboxed for a safe execution at the edge.
  In this context, we propose a technique that (i) automatically diversifies
WebAssembly binaries that are deployed to the edge and (ii) randomizes
execution paths at runtime, turning the execution of the services into a moving
target. Given a service tobe deployed at the edge, we automatically synthesize
functionally equivalent variants for the functions that implement the
service.All the variants are then wrapped into a single multivariant
WebAssembly binary. When the service endpoint is executed,every time a function
is invoked, one of its variants is randomly selected. We implement this
technique in the MEWE tool and we validate it with 7 services for cryptography
and QR encoding. MEWE generates multivariant binaries that embed hundreds of
function variants. We execute the multivariant binaries on the worldwide edge
platform provided by Fastly. We show that,at runtime, the multivariant exhibit
a remarkable diversity ofexecution traces, across the whole edge platform.

DARTS still suffers from frequent performance collapse, which happens when some
operations, such as skip connections, zeroes and poolings, dominate the

is attributed to bi-level optimization. We propose Single-DARTS which merely
uses single-level optimization, updating network weights and architecture
parameters simultaneously with the same data batch. Even single-level
optimization has been previously attempted, no literature provides a systematic
explanation on this essential point. Replacing the bi-level optimization,
Single-DARTS obviously alleviates performance collapse as well as enhances the
stability of architecture search. Experiment results show that Single-DARTS
achieves state-of-the-art performance on mainstream search spaces. For
instance, on NAS-Benchmark-201, the searched architectures are nearly optimal
ones. We also validate that the single-level optimization framework is much
more stable than the bi-level one. We hope that this simple yet effective

mixing elements in single-screw extruders. Extruders enable the continuous
production of constant-cross-section profiles. Equipped with one or several
screw-shaped rotors, extruders transport polymer particles towards the outlet.
Due to shear heating, melting is induced and a melt stream is created, which
can be further processed. While many variants of multi-screw extruders exist, a
significant share of all extrusion machines is made up of single-screw
extruders due to their comparatively low operating costs and complexity. While
the reduced complexity yields economic benefits, single-screw extruders' mixing
capabilities, i.e., their ability to produce a melt with a homogeneous material
and temperature distribution, suffer compared to multi-screw extruders. To
compensate for this shortcoming, so-called mixing elements are added to the
screw to enhance mixing by recurring flow reorientations. In view of the
largely unintuitive flow characteristics of polymer melts, we present an
optimization framework that allows designing these mixing elements numerically
based on finite-element simulations of the melt flow. To reduce the
computational demand required by shape optimization of a complete mixing
section, we only focus on the shape optimization of a single mixing element.
This paper presents advances in three aspects of numerical design: (1) A
combination of free-form deformation and surface splines is presented, allowing
to parameterize the mixing element's shape by very few variables. (2) The
combination of this concept with a linear-elasticity-based mesh update method
to deform the computational domain without the need for remeshing is
demonstrated. (3) A simple yet robust and sensitive objective formulation to
assess distributive mixing in laminar flows based on a measure for the
interfacial area is proposed.

these stars, in fact, points to nucleosynthesis mechanisms that took place
within a former asymptotic giant branch (AGB) companion, now an invisible white
dwarf. From high-resolution ($R=48000$) spectra in the optical, we derived the
abundances either by equivalent width measurements or synthetic spectra
computations, and compared them with available data for field giant and dwarf

resulted in [La/Fe] ratios up to 1.2 dex lower than values previously reported

to field stars. Comparison to model predictions are satisfactory for
second-to-first $s$-process peak ratios (e.g., [La/Sr]) and the ratios of the
predominantly $r$-process element Eu to La. However, the observed [Nb,Mo,Ru/Sr]

compared with traditional graph-based methods, the constructed hypergraphs are
usually much sparser, which leads to a dilemma when balancing the benefits of
hypergraphs and the modelling difficulty. Moreover, existing sequential
hypergraph recommendation overlooks the temporal modelling among user
relationships, which neglects rich social signals from the recommendation data.
To tackle the above shortcomings of the existing hypergraph-based sequential
recommendations, we propose a novel architecture named Hyperbolic Hypergraph
representation learning method for Sequential Recommendation (H2SeqRec) with
pre-training phase. Specifically, we design three self-supervised tasks to
obtain the pre-training item embeddings to feed or fuse into the following
recommendation architecture (with two ways to use the pre-trained embeddings).
In the recommendation phase, we learn multi-scale item embeddings via a
hierarchical structure to capture multiple time-span information. To alleviate
the negative impact of sparse hypergraphs, we utilize a hyperbolic space-based
hypergraph convolutional neural network to learn the dynamic item embeddings.
Also, we design an item enhancement module to capture dynamic social
information at each timestamp to improve effectiveness. Extensive experiments
are conducted on two real-world datasets to prove the effectiveness and high
performance of the model.

will need to be devised in order to make use of the ever increasing number of
viral sequences being collected.
  Since identifying variants is an important part of understanding the
evolution of a virus, in this paper, we propose an approach based on clustering
sequences to identify the current major SARS-CoV-2 variants. Using a $k$-mer
based feature vector generation and efficient feature selection methods, our
approach is effective in identifying variants, as well as being efficient and
scalable to millions of sequences. Such a clustering method allows us to show
the relative proportion of each variant over time, giving the rate of spread of
each variant in different locations -- something which is important for vaccine
development and distribution. We also compute the importance of each amino acid
position of the spike protein in identifying a given variant in terms of
information gain. Positions of high variant-specific importance tend to agree
with those reported by the USA's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), further demonstrating our approach.

pursuit of better CD performance, it has become a tendency to design deeper and
more complicated FCNs, which inevitably brings about huge numbers of parameters
and an unbearable computational burden. With the goal of designing a quite deep
architecture to obtain more precise CD results while simultaneously decreasing
parameter numbers to improve efficiency, in this work, we present a very deep
and efficient CD network, entitled EffCDNet. In EffCDNet, to reduce the
numerous parameters associated with deep architecture, an efficient convolution
consisting of depth-wise convolution and group convolution with a channel
shuffle mechanism is introduced to replace standard convolutional layers. In
terms of the specific network architecture, EffCDNet does not use mainstream
UNet-like architecture, but rather adopts the architecture with a very deep
encoder and a lightweight decoder. In the very deep encoder, two very deep
siamese streams stacked by efficient convolution first extract two highly
representative and informative feature maps from input image-pairs.
Subsequently, an efficient ASPP module is designed to capture multi-scale
change information. In the lightweight decoder, a recurrent criss-cross
self-attention (RCCA) module is applied to efficiently utilize non-local
similar feature representations to enhance discriminability for each pixel,
thus effectively separating the changed and unchanged regions. Moreover, to
tackle the optimization problem in confused pixels, two novel loss functions
based on information entropy are presented. On two challenging CD datasets, our
approach outperforms other SOTA FCN-based methods, with only benchmark-level
parameter numbers and quite low computational overhead.

paper proposes a practical gastric cancer screening system for X-ray images
taken under realistic clinical imaging conditions. Our system not only provides
a diagnostic result for each image, but also provides an explanation for the
result by displaying candidate cancer areas with bounding boxes. Training
object detection models to do this was very expensive in terms of assigning
supervised labels, and had the disadvantage of not being able to use negative
(i.e., non-cancer) data for training. Our proposal consists of two novel
techniques: (1) refined stochastic gastric image augmentation (R-sGAIA) and (2)
hard boundary box training (HBBT). The R-sGAIA probabilistically highlights the
gastric folds in the X-ray image based on medical knowledge, thus increasing
the detection efficiency of gastric cancer. The HBBT is a new, efficient, and
versatile training method that can reduce the number of false positive
detections by actively using negative samples. The results showed that the
proposed R-sGAIA and HBBT significantly improved the F1 score by 5.9% compared
to the baseline EfficientDet-D7 + RandAugment (F1: 57.8%, recall: 90.2%,
precision: 42.5%). This score is higher than the physician's cancer detection

bottomonium dynamics in the QGP through the use of pNRQCD and an open quantum
systems approach. This approach allows one to evolve the heavy-quarkonium
reduced density matrix, taking into account non-unitary effective Hamiltonian
evolution of the wave-function and quantum jumps between different angular
momentum and color states. In the case of a strong coupled QGP in which E <<
T,m_D << 1/a_0, the corresponding evolution equation is Markovian and can
therefore be mapped to a Lindblad evolution equation. To solve the resulting
Lindblad equation, we make use of a stochastic unraveling called the quantum

also found that while uncharged rotating black holes expel external vacuum
magnetic field from their event horizon (the Meissner effect), electric
charging of black holes pulls the magnetic field lines back on it, resembling
what has been observed in some previous force-free, RMHD and PIC simulations of

the next layer for integrating cross-level information. Moreover, to capture
rich complementary multi-modal information for boosting the SOD performance, we
propose a multi-modal feature aggregation (MFA) module to integrate the

  contamination, raising concerns for pangolin CoV host attribution","55 pages, 15 figures",,,,"q-bio.GN","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Metagenomic datasets from pangolin tissue specimens have previously yielded
SARS-related coronaviruses which show high homology in their receptor binding
domain to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting a potential zoonotic source for this feature
of the human virus, possibly via recombination (Liu et al. 2019, Lam et al.
2020, Xiao et al. 2020, Liu et al. 2020). Here we re-examine these published
datasets. We report that only a few pangolin samples were found to contain
coronavirus reads, and even then in low abundance, while other non-pangolin
hosted viruses were present in higher abundance. We also discovered extensive
contamination with human, rodent, and other mammalian gene sequences, which was
a surprising finding. Furthermore, we uncovered a number of pangolin CoV
sequences embedded in standard laboratory cloning vectors, which suggests the
pangolin specimens could have been contaminated with sequences derived from
synthetic biology experiments. Finally, we discover a third pangolin dataset
(He et al. 2022) with low levels of SARSr-CoV sequences and unambiguous
extensive contamination of several pangolin samples. For these reasons, we find
it unlikely that the pangolins in question had a coronavirus infection while
alive, and all current versions of the cited papers claiming a zoonotic
infection of pangolins with a SARS-r CoV require substantial corrections and
should be retracted until such corrections are made.

good approximation, so-called isomorphs, have been identified in the
thermodynamic phase diagrams of several model liquids and solids. This paper
reports computer simulations of the transverse and longitudinal collective
dynamics at different length scales along an isomorph of the Lennard-Jones
system. Our findings are compared to corresponding results along an isotherm
and an isochore. Confirming the theoretical prediction, the reduced-unit
dynamics of the transverse momentum density is invariant to a good
approximation along the isomorph at all time and length scales. Likewise, the
wave-vector dependent shear-stress autocorrelation function is found to be
isomorph invariant. A similar invariance is not seen along the isotherm or the
isochore. Using a spatially non-local hydrodynamic model for the transverse
momentum-density time-autocorrelation function, the macroscopic shear viscosity
and its wave dependence are determined, demonstrating that the shear viscosity
is isomorph invariant on all length scales studied. This analysis implies the
existence of a novel length scale which characterizes each isomorph. The
transverse sound-wave velocity, the Maxwell relaxation time, and the rigidity
shear modulus are also isomorph invariant. In contrast, the reduced-unit
dynamics of the mass density is not invariant at length scales longer than the
inter-particle distance. By fitting to a generalized hydrodynamic model, we
extract values for the wave-vector-dependent thermal diffusion coefficient,
sound attenuation coefficient, and adiabatic sound velocity. The isomorph
variation of these quantities in reduced units at long length scales can be
eliminated by scaling with the density-scaling, a fundamental quantity in the
isomorph theory framework, an empirical observation that remains to be
explained theoretically.

allowing the important generalization that their interior structure represents
that of all DA and DB white dwarfs. This is not the case for the hottest

stars rich in nitrogen, which by itself cannot cause pulsation driving, pulsate

the volumes of daily incoming and outgoing parcels for delivery, is critical

specifically for resource allocation optimization and promotional activity
arrangement. A precise estimate of consumer delivery requests has to involve
sequential factors such as shopping behaviors, weather conditions, events,
business campaigns, and their couplings. Besides, conventional sequence
prediction assumes a stable sequence evolution, failing to address complex
nonlinear sequences and various feature effects in the above multi-source data.
Although deep networks and attention mechanisms demonstrate the potential of
complex sequence modeling, extant networks ignore the heterogeneous and
coupling situation between features and sequences, resulting in weak prediction
accuracy. To address these issues, we propose DeepExpress - a deep-learning
based express delivery sequence prediction model, which extends the classic
seq2seq framework to learning complex coupling between sequence and features.
DeepExpress leverages an express delivery seq2seq learning, a
carefully-designed heterogeneous feature representation, and a novel joint

sequence-feature coupling for precise estimation. Experimental results on
real-world data demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms both shallow

future 6G network. To overcome the severe attenuation and relieve the high
power consumption, massive MIMO with hybrid precoding has been widely
considered for THz communication. However, accurate wideband channel estimation
is challenging in THz massive MIMO systems. The existing wideband channel
estimation schemes based on the ideal assumption of common sparse channel
support will suffer from a severe performance loss due to the beam split
effect. In this paper, we propose a beam split pattern detection based channel
estimation scheme to realize reliable wideband channel estimation.
Specifically, a comprehensive analysis on the angle-domain sparse structure of
the wideband channel is provided by considering the beam split effect. Based on
the analysis, we define a series of index sets called as beam split patterns,
which are proved to have a one-to-one match to different physical channel
directions. Inspired by this one-to-one match, we propose to estimate the
physical channel direction by exploiting beam split patterns at first. Then,
the sparse channel supports at different subcarriers can be obtained by
utilizing a support detection window. This support detection window is
generated by expanding the beam split pattern which is determined by the
obtained physical channel direction. The above estimation procedure will be
repeated path by path until all path components are estimated. The proposed
scheme exploits the wideband channel property implied by the beam split effect,
which can significantly improve the channel estimation accuracy. Simulation
results show that the proposed scheme is able to achieve higher accuracy than
existing schemes.

SIFT performs quite close to SuperGlue and even outperforms in terms of mean

kernel structure parameters and the kernel weight vector updating. For
structure parameters, the kernel dictionary is selected by some sparsification
techniques with online selective modeling criteria, and moreover the kernel
covariance matrix is intermittently optimized in the light of the covariance
matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES). Optimizing the real symmetric
covariance matrix can not only improve the kernel structure's flexibility by
the cross relatedness of the input variables, but also partly alleviate the
prediction uncertainty caused by the kernel dictionary selection for
nonstationary time series. In order to sufficiently capture the underlying
dynamic characteristics in prediction-error time series, a generalized
optimization strategy is designed to construct the kernel dictionary
sequentially in multiple kernel connection modes. The generalized optimization
strategy provides a more self-contained way to construct the entire kernel
connections, which enhances the ability to adaptively track the changing
dynamic characteristics. Numerical simulations have demonstrated that the

the realization of a half-vortex (or double Cooper pair) state and its BKT
transition. The half-vortex state is sharply characterized by a flux quantum
which is half of the ordinary superconductors. Such a $\pi$-periodic Josephson
effect can be easily detected as doubled ac Josephson frequency. We further
show that the Josephson current $I$ is always accompanied by a
$chiral~Josephson~current$ $I_5$. Strain pseudo gauge fields that couple to the
$\chi$, destabilize the half-vortex state. We argue that our ""complex
superconductor"" realizes an extension of XY model that supports confinement
transition from half-vortex to full vortex excitations.

we identify relevant low-energy degrees of freedom on the $8Pmmn$ lattice and
find that these atomic orbitals reside on an effective honeycomb lattice (inner

$8Pmmn$ lattice (ridge sites). Integrating out the high-energy atomic orbitals,
gives rise to remarkably large effective further neighbor hoppings on the
coarse grained ""honeycomb graph"" of inner sites that determine the location and
tilt of the Dirac cone. Molecular orbitals -- that can be modified by atomic
manipulations -- are responsible for the creation of further neighbor edges on
the honeycomb graph that controls the tilt of the resulting Dirac cone. This
leads to an effective tight-binding model on a parent honeycomb graph that
facilitates numerical modeling of various effects such as
disorder/interactions/symmetry-breaking for tilted Dirac cone fermions. Since
the tilt is a proxy to spacetime metric, our result offers a robust perspective
on the fabrication of desired emergent spacetime structure and synthesis of
geometric forces at ambient conditions that are likely to enhance our control
on the movement of electrons in electric/optical devices.

decoding a global feature learned from the input point cloud, which often leads
to deficient results in preserving topology consistency and surface details. In
this work, we present ME-PCN, a point completion network that leverages
`emptiness' in 3D shape space. Given a single depth scan, previous methods
often encode the occupied partial shapes while ignoring the empty regions (e.g.
holes) in depth maps. In contrast, we argue that these `emptiness' clues
indicate shape boundaries that can be used to improve topology representation
and detail granularity on surfaces. Specifically, our ME-PCN encodes both the
occupied point cloud and the neighboring `empty points'. It estimates
coarse-grained but complete and reasonable surface points in the first stage,
followed by a refinement stage to produce fine-grained surface details.
Comprehensive experiments verify that our ME-PCN presents better qualitative

prove that our `emptiness' design is lightweight and easy to embed in existing

Furthermore, When the aircraft is flying at a high speed, usually larger than
0.3 Ma, the produced boundary layer will impair the performance of
aircraft-based QKD. The boundary layer would introduce random wavefront
aberration, jitter and extra intensity attenuation to the transmitted photons.
However, previous airborne QKD implementations only considered the influences
from atmospheric turbulence and molecular scattering, but ignored the boundary
layer effects. In this article, we propose a detailed performance evaluation
scheme of airborne QKD with boundary layer effects and estimate the overall
photon transmission efficiency, quantum bit error rate and final secure key
rate. Through simulations and modeling, in our proposed airborne QKD scenario,
the boundary layer would introduce 3.5dB loss to the transmitted photons and
decrease 70.7% of the secure key rate, which shows that the aero-optical
effects caused by the boundary layer can not be ignored. With tolerated quantum
bit error rate set to 10%, the suggested quantum communication azimuth angle
between the aircraft and the ground station is within 60 degrees. Moreover, the
optimal beacon laser module and adaptive optics module are suggested to be

collective behavior in networks with higher-order interactions encoded in

Function framework to a new composite Laplacian matrix that encodes multi-order
interactions including, e.g., both dyadic and triadic couplings. We show that
as higher-order coupling interactions are equitably strengthened, so that
overall coupling is conserved, the optimal collective behavior improves. We
find that this phenomenon stems from the broadening of a composite Laplacian's
eigenvalue spectrum, which improves the optimal collective behavior and widens
the range of possible behaviors. Moreover, we find in constrained optimization
scenarios that a nontrivial, ideal balance between the relative strengths of
pair-wise and higher-order interactions leads to the strongest collective
behavior supported by a network. This work provides insight into how systems
balance interactions of different types to optimize or broaden their dynamical
range of behavior, especially for self-regulating systems like the brain.

the young stellar objects (YSOs). We also study the clouds kinematics searching
for gradients and jet signatures that could trace different star formation

  1) A deviation bound for the sums of independent positive-semi-definite

Lounici [Bernoulli, 2017] on the sample covariance matrix in the sub-Gaussian

dimension-free version of the bound of Adamczak, Litvak, Pajor and
Tomczak-Jaegermann [Journal Of Amer. Math. Soc., 2010] on the sample covariance
matrix in the log-concave case. 3) Dimension-free bounds for the operator norm
of the sums of random tensors of rank one formed either by sub-Gaussian or by
log-concave random vectors. This complements the result of Gu\'{e}don and
Rudelson [Adv. in Math., 2007]. 4) A non-isotropic version of the result of

of positive semi-definite matrices with heavy-tailed entries, sharpening the
bound of Oliveira [Prob. Th. and Rel. Fields, 2016].
  Our approach is based on the duality formula between entropy and moment
generating functions. In contrast to the known proofs of dimension-free bounds,
we avoid Talagrand's majorizing measure theorem, as well as generic chaining
bounds for empirical processes. Some of our tools were pioneered by O. Catoni

the past few years. However, the quality of video delivery system greatly
depends on the Internet bandwidth. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are utilized to
improve the quality of video delivery recently. These methods divide a video
into chunks, and stream LR video chunks and corresponding content-aware models
to the client. The client runs the inference of models to super-resolve the LR
chunks. Consequently, a large number of models are streamed in order to deliver
a video. In this paper, we first carefully study the relation between models of
different chunks, then we tactfully design a joint training framework along
with the Content-aware Feature Modulation (CaFM) layer to compress these models
for neural video delivery. {\bf With our method, each video chunk only requires
less than $1\% $ of original parameters to be streamed, achieving even better
SR performance.} We conduct extensive experiments across various SR backbones,
video time length, and scaling factors to demonstrate the advantages of our
method. Besides, our method can be also viewed as a new approach of video
coding. Our primary experiments achieve better video quality compared with the
commercial H.264 and H.265 standard under the same storage cost, showing the
great potential of the proposed method. Code is available

gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The Gamma-ray Module (GMOD), the main mission payload,
is a small gamma-ray spectrometer comprising a 25 mm $\times$ 25 mm $\times$ 40

energies in a range from tens of keV to a few MeV.
  Monte Carlo simulations were performed using the Medium Energy Gamma-ray
Astronomy Library to evaluate GMOD's capability for the detection of GRBs in
low Earth orbit. The simulations used a detailed mass model of the full
spacecraft derived from a very high-fidelity 3D CAD model. The sky-average

The instrument is expected to detect between 11 and 14 GRBs, at a significance

architecture, recently, deep-learning based watermarking algorithms have been
widely studied. The basic framework of such algorithm is the auto-encoder like
end-to-end architecture with an encoder, a noise layer and a decoder. The key
to guarantee robustness is the adversarial training with the differential noise
layer. However, we found that none of the existing framework can well ensure
the robustness against JPEG compression, which is non-differential but is an
essential and important image processing operation. To address such
limitations, we proposed a novel end-to-end training architecture, which
utilizes Mini-Batch of Real and Simulated JPEG compression (MBRS) to enhance
the JPEG robustness. Precisely, for different mini-batches, we randomly choose
one of real JPEG, simulated JPEG and noise-free layer as the noise layer.
Besides, we suggest to utilize the Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks which can
learn better feature in embedding and extracting stage, and propose a ""message
processor"" to expand the message in a more appreciate way. Meanwhile, to
improve the robustness against crop attack, we propose an additive diffusion
block into the network. The extensive experimental results have demonstrated
the superior performance of the proposed scheme compared with the
state-of-the-art algorithms. Under the JPEG compression with quality factor
Q=50, our models achieve a bit error rate less than 0.01% for extracted
messages, with PSNR larger than 36 for the encoded images, which shows the
well-enhanced robustness against JPEG attack. Besides, under many other
distortions such as Gaussian filter, crop, cropout and dropout, the proposed
framework also obtains strong robustness. The code implemented by PyTorch

the one hand, the available data are limited because of privacy concerns with
crawling social media sites; on the other hand, the diversity of drug dealing
patterns makes it difficult to reliably distinguish drug dealers from common

effectiveness of the proposed method in identifying drug dealers (almost 95%
accuracy). Moreover, we have developed a hashtag-based community detection

impact both turbulence and flame characteristics at small scales. In this
study, we evaluate these impacts by examining enstrophy dynamics and the
internal structure of the flame for lean premixed hydrogen-air combustion,
neglecting secondary Soret and Dufour effects. We performed three-dimensional
DNS of these flames by implementing the Stefan-Maxwell equations in the code
NGA to represent multicomponent mass transport, and we simulated statistically
planar lean premixed hydrogen-air flames using both mixture-averaged and
multicomponent models. The mixture-averaged model underpredicts the peak
enstrophy by up to 13% in the flame front. Comparing the enstrophy budgets of
these flames, the multicomponent simulation yields larger peak magnitudes
compared to the mixture-averaged simulation in the reaction zone, showing
differences of 17% and 14% in the normalized stretching and viscous effects
terms. In the super-adiabatic regions of the flame, the mixture-averaged model
overpredicts the viscous effects by up to 13%. To assess the effect of these
differences on flame structure, we reconstructed the average local internal
structure of the turbulent flame through statistical analysis of the scalar
gradient field. Based on this analysis, we show that large differences in
viscous effects contribute to significant differences in the average local
flame structure between the two models.

achieved unprecedented performance in upscaling frames with unknown
degradation. These models are able to accurately estimate the unknown
downscaling kernel from a given low-resolution (LR) image in order to leverage
the kernel during restoration. Although these approaches have largely been
successful, they are predominantly image-based and therefore do not exploit the
temporal properties of the kernels across multiple video frames. In this paper,
we investigated the temporal properties of the kernels and highlighted its
importance in the task of blind video super-resolution. Specifically, we
measured the kernel temporal consistency of real-world videos and illustrated
how the estimated kernels might change per frame in videos of varying
dynamicity of the scene and its objects. With this new insight, we revisited
previous popular video SR approaches, and showed that previous assumptions of
using a fixed kernel throughout the restoration process can lead to visual
artifacts when upscaling real-world videos. In order to counteract this, we
tailored existing single-image and video SR techniques to leverage kernel
consistency during both kernel estimation and video upscaling processes.

different types of cells in the tumor microenvironment from a digitized image
of a Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained tissue section can be used for various
tasks in computational pathology such as the analysis of cellular topology and
interactions, subtype prediction, survival analysis, etc. In this work, we
propose an image-based cellular composition predictor (ALBRT) which can
accurately predict the presence and counts of different types of cells in a
given image patch. ALBRT, by its contrastive-learning inspired design, learns a
compact and rotation-invariant feature representation that is then used for
cellular composition prediction of different cell types. It offers significant
improvement over existing state-of-the-art approaches for cell classification
and counting. The patch-level feature representation learned by ALBRT is
transferrable for cellular composition analysis over novel datasets and can
also be utilized for downstream prediction tasks in CPath as well. The code and

systems (MBSs) subject to changing topology and multiple impacts based on
linear projection operator. An oblique projection matrix ubiquitously derives
all characteristic variables of such systems as follow: i) The constrained
acceleration before jump discontinuity from projection of unconstrained
acceleration, ii) post-impact velocity from projection of pre-impact velocity,
iii) impulse during impact from projection of pre-impact momentum, iv)
generalized constraint force from projection of generalized input force, and v)
post-impact kinetic energy from pre-impact kinetic energy based on projected
inertia matrix. All solutions are presented in closed-form with elegant
geometrical interpretations. The formulation is general enough to be applicable
to MBSs subject to simultaneous multiple impacts with non-identical restitution
coefficients, changing topology, i.e., unilateral constraints becomes inactive
or vice versa, or even when the overall constraint Jacobian becomes singular.
Not only do the solutions always exist regardless the constraint condition, but
also the condition number for a generalized constraint inertia matrix is
minimized in order to reduce numerical sensitivity in computation of the
projection matrix to roundoff errors. The model is proven to be energetically
consistent if a global restitution coefficient is assumed. In the case of
non-identical restitution coefficients, the set of energetically consistent
restitution matrices is characterized by using Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI).

$4 \times n$ rectangular board using $2 \times 1$ domino tiles, where the
number of rows is fixed and we present a recursive formula based on $m$ and the

features with those of Class I sources from the literature, we find that their
Br gamma and CO emission are generally consistent in strength and velocity
width. The Br gamma line profiles are broad and centrally peaked, with FWHMs of
200 km/s and wings extending to 300 km/s. The line ratios of our H2 emission
features, which are spatially extended for some sources, are consistent with
shock excitation and indicate the presence of strong jets or a disk wind.
Within our small sample, the frequency of CO band emission (67%) is high
relative to that of Class I samples (15%), indicating that Class 0s have high
inner disk accretion rates, similar to those of the most actively accreting

similar accretion mechanisms to the more evolved classes, with strong organized

burden. So far, ML were engaged to create CLs and values on the edges of these
CLs expressing ML preferences at solution insertion. Although promising, these
systems do not clearly restrict what the ML learns and does to create
solutions, bringing with them some generalization issues. Therefore, motivated
by exploratory and statistical studies, in this work we instead use a machine
learning model to confirm the addition in the solution just for high probable
edges. CLs of the high probable edge are employed as input, and the ML is in
charge of distinguishing cases where such edges are in the optimal solution
from those where they are not. . This strategy enables a better generalization
and creates an efficient balance between machine learning and searching
techniques. Our ML-Constructive heuristic is trained on small instances. Then,
it is able to produce solutions, without losing quality, to large problems as
well. We compare our results with classic constructive heuristics, showing good
performances for TSPLIB instances up to 1748 cities. Although our heuristic

discovered two types of 4D relative velocities: binary and ternary, along with
the rules for adding them. They were first published in conference materials in
2004, and the second time in a peer-reviewed journal in 2007. These physically
logical and mathematically precise concepts are so subtle that Oziewicz's
numerous preprints have yet to receive the recognition they deserve.
  This work was planned to be a more review, but a thorough review of the
little-known results was made in an original synthetic manner with numerous
generalizations. The Part I presents the Oziewicz-\'Swierk-Bol\'os (and
Matolsci or Bini-Carini-Jantzen) binary relative velocity and the
Oziewicz-Ungar-Dragan (also Celakoska-Chakmakov-Petrushevski on the basis of
Urbantke, as well as Wyk) ternary relative velocity. The Einstein-Oziewicz and
Einstein-Minkowski velocities, which are a four-dimensional generalization of
Einstein velocities addition, also have a ternary character. This also applies
to Oziewicz-Minkowski relative velocity, which is a time-like equivalent
(generalization) of the canonical ternary velocity. It turns out that the
Lorentz transformation of velocity itself is already ternary anchored. This
fact is explicitly revealed by the manifestly covariant Lorentz transformation
of velocity, which is the main tool of the work.

$F$-factor in $H$ is a set of vertex-disjoint copies of $F$ that together
covers the vertex set of $H$. Lenz and Mubayi [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 2016]
studied the $F$-factor problem in quasi-random $k$-graphs with minimum degree
$\Omega(n^{k-1})$. They posed the problem of characterizing the $k$-graphs $F$
such that every sufficiently large quasi-random $k$-graph with constant edge
density and minimum degree $\Omega(n^{k-1})$ contains an $F$-factor, and in
particular, they showed that all linear $k$-graphs satisfy this property. In
this paper we prove a general theorem on $F$-factors which reduces the
$F$-factor problem of Lenz and Mubayi to a natural sub-problem, that is, the
$F$-cover problem. By using this result, we answer the question of Lenz and
Mubayi for those $F$ which are $k$-partite $k$-graphs, and for all 3-graphs
$F$, separately. Our characterization result on 3-graphs is motivated by the
recent work of Reiher, R\""odl and Schacht [J. Lond. Math. Soc., 2018] that
classifies the 3-graphs with vanishing Tur\'an density in quasi-random

generate realistic and diverse sets of outputs. However, existing models suffer
from the key practical limitation of modelling shapes holistically and thus
cannot perform conditional sampling, i.e. they are not able to generate
variants on individual parts of generated shapes without modifying the rest of
the shape. This is limiting for applications such as 3D CAD design that involve
adjusting created shapes at multiple levels of detail. To address this, we
introduce LSD-StructureNet, an augmentation to the StructureNet architecture
that enables re-generation of parts situated at arbitrary positions in the
hierarchies of its outputs. We achieve this by learning individual,
probabilistic conditional decoders for each hierarchy depth. We evaluate
LSD-StructureNet on the PartNet dataset, the largest dataset of 3D shapes
represented by hierarchies of parts. Our results show that contrarily to
existing methods, LSD-StructureNet can perform conditional sampling without

probabilities for multiple, often closely related, user actions. For example,
predicting if a user will click on an advertisement and if they will then
purchase the advertised product. The conceptual similarity between these tasks
has promoted the use of multi-task learning: a class of algorithms that aim to
bring positive inductive transfer from related tasks. Here, we empirically
evaluate multi-task learning approaches with neural networks for an online
advertising task. Specifically, we consider approximating the probability of
post-click conversion events (installs) (CVR) for mobile app advertising on a
large-scale advertising platform, using the related click events (CTR) as an
auxiliary task. We use an ablation approach to systematically study recent
approaches that incorporate both multitask learning and ""entire space modeling""
which train the CVR on all logged examples rather than learning a conditional
likelihood of conversion given clicked. Based on these results we show that
several different approaches result in similar levels of positive transfer from
the data-abundant CTR task to the CVR task and offer some insight into how the
multi-task design choices address the two primary problems affecting the CVR
task: data sparsity and data bias. Our findings add to the growing body of
evidence suggesting that standard multi-task learning is a sensible approach to
modelling related events in real-world large-scale applications and suggest the
specific multitask approach can be guided by ease of implementation in an
existing system.

systems in contact with a frictional surface is presented. It is shown that the
model can lead to energetic consistency in both slip state and stick state upon
imposing specific constraints on the coefficient of friction (CoF) and the
coefficient of restitution (CoR). A discriminator in the form of a quadratic
function of the pre-impact velocity is introduced based on isotropic Coulomb
constraint such that its sign determines whether the impact occurs in the
sticking mode or in the slipping mode just prior to the contact. Solving the
zero-crossings of such a function in terms of the CoF and the CoR variables
leads to another discriminator called Critical CoF, which is the lowest static
CoF required to prevent the subsequent impulse vector violating the isotropic
friction cone constraint. Investigating conditions for the energetically
consistent impact model reveals that the maximum values of either CoR or CoF
should be limited depending on stick state or slip state. Furthermore, it is
shown that these upper-bound limits in conjunction with the introduced Critical
CoF variable can be used to specify the admissible set of CoR and CoF
parameters, which can be represented by two distinct regions in the plan of CoF
versus CoR.

that the annual rate of growth in the US CPI is a function of the annual growth
