Reality (VAM) technologies that provide immersive, intuitive interfaces to
facilitate Human-Robot Interaction. These frameworks, however, fail to capture
key characteristics of the growing subfield of VAM-HRI and can be difficult to
consistently apply due to continuous scales. This work builds upon these prior
frameworks through the creation of a Tool for Organizing Key Characteristics of
VAM-HRI Systems (TOKCS). TOKCS discretizes the continuous scales used within
prior works for more consistent classification and adds additional
characteristics related to a robot's internal model, anchor locations,
manipulability, and the system's software and hardware. To showcase the tool's
capability, TOKCS is applied to the ten papers from the fourth VAM-HRI workshop
and examined for key trends and takeaways. These trends highlight the
expressive capability of TOKCS while also helping frame newer trends and future
work recommendations for VAM-HRI research.

directional solidification of a model symmetric ternary eutectic alloy. In
contrast to two-phase eutectics that have only a single possibility,
${\alpha}{\beta}{\alpha}{\beta}$..., as the growth pattern, during three-phase
eutectic growth infinite possibilities exist. Here, we explore the possible
existence of pattern selection influenced by the change in the solid-solid
interfacial energies and the diffusivities. We begin the study by estimating
the undercooling vs. spacing variation for the simplest possible configurations
of pattern lengths 3 and 4, where phase-field simulations are utilized to
quantify the influence of the solid-solid interfacial energy and the contrast
in the component diffusivities. Subsequently, extended simulations consisting
of multiple periods of ${\alpha}{\beta}{\delta}$... as well as
${\alpha}{\beta}{\delta}{\beta}$... are carried out for assessing the stability
of the configurations to long-wavelength perturbations in spacing. Thereafter,
growth competition among the simplest patterns is investigated through
phase-field simulations of coupled growth of configurations of the type
[${\alpha}{\beta}{\delta}]_m[{\alpha}{\beta}{\delta}{\beta}]_n$, (m,n) being
the respective number of periods. Finally, pattern selection is studied by
initializing with random initial configurations and classifying the emerging
patterns based on the phase sequences. The principal finding is that, while
there is no strong phase selection, between the solid-solid interfacial
energies and the contrast in the component diffusivities, we find the latter to
strongly influence pattern morphology.

relationship among variables in a parametric vector autoregressive model that
introduces additional cointegrating links between these variables and partial
sums of the equilibrium errors. This paper departs from the parametric model,
using a semiparametric formulation that reveals the explicit role that
singularity of the long run conditional covariance matrix plays in determining
multicointegration. The semiparametric framework has the advantage that short
run dynamics do not need to be modeled and estimation by standard techniques
such as fully modified least squares (FM-OLS) on the original I(1) system is
straightforward. The paper derives FM-OLS limit theory in the multicointegrated
setting, showing how faster rates of convergence are achieved in the direction
of singularity and that the limit distribution depends on the distribution of
the conditional one-sided long run covariance estimator used in FM-OLS
estimation. Wald tests of restrictions on the regression coefficients have
nonstandard limit theory which depends on nuisance parameters in general. The
usual tests are shown to be conservative when the restrictions are isolated to
the directions of singularity and, under certain conditions, are invariant to
singularity otherwise. Simulations show that approximations derived in the
paper work well in finite samples. The findings are illustrated empirically in
an analysis of fiscal sustainability of the US government over the post-war
period.

benefits in efficient memory utilization and ease of management. So far, memory
disaggregation research has all taken one of two approaches: building/emulating
memory nodes using regular servers or building them using raw memory devices
with no processing power. The former incurs higher monetary cost and faces tail
latency and scalability limitations, while the latter introduces performance,
security, and management problems.
  Server-based memory nodes and memory nodes with no processing power are two
extreme approaches. We seek a sweet spot in the middle by proposing a
hardware-based memory disaggregation solution that has the right amount of
processing power at memory nodes. Furthermore, we take a clean-slate approach
by starting from the requirements of memory disaggregation and designing a

However, due to different kinematic characteristics, many brain injury risk
estimation models are not generalizable across the variety of impacts that
humans may sustain. The current definitions of head impact subtypes are based
on impact sources (e.g., football, traffic accident), which may not reflect the
intrinsic kinematic similarities of impacts across the impact sources. To
investigate the potential new definitions of impact subtypes based on
kinematics, 3,161 head impacts from various sources including simulation,
college football, mixed martial arts, and car racing were collected. We applied
the K-means clustering to cluster the impacts on 16 standardized temporal
features from head rotation kinematics. Then, we developed subtype-specific
ridge regression models for cumulative strain damage (using the threshold of
15%), which significantly improved the estimation accuracy compared with the
baseline method which mixed impacts from different sources and developed one
model (R^2 from 0.7 to 0.9). To investigate the effect of kinematic features,
we presented the top three critical features (maximum resultant angular
acceleration, maximum angular acceleration along the z-axis, maximum linear
acceleration along the y-axis) based on regression accuracy and used logistic
regression to find the critical points for each feature that partitioned the
subtypes. This study enables researchers to define head impact subtypes in a
data-driven manner, which leads to more generalizable brain injury risk
estimation.

distributed according to the retinal sensitivity of the human visual system,
which rapidly decreases with increasing eccentricity. The use of Generative
Adversarial Networks has recently been shown to be a promising solution for
such a task, as they can successfully hallucinate missing image information. As
in the case of other supervised learning approaches, the definition of the loss
function and the training strategy heavily influence the quality of the output.
In this work,we consider the problem of efficiently guiding the training of
foveated reconstruction techniques such that they are more aware of the
capabilities and limitations of the human visual system, and thus can
reconstruct visually important image features. Our primary goal is to make the
training procedure less sensitive to distortions that humans cannot detect and
focus on penalizing perceptually important artifacts. Given the nature of
GAN-based solutions, we focus on the sensitivity of human vision to
hallucination in case of input samples with different densities. We propose
psychophysical experiments, a dataset, and a procedure for training foveated
image reconstruction. The proposed strategy renders the generator network
flexible by penalizing only perceptually important deviations in the output. As
a result, the method emphasized the recovery of perceptually important image
features. We evaluated our strategy and compared it with alternative solutions
by using a newly trained objective metric, a recent foveated video quality
metric, and user experiments. Our evaluations revealed significant improvements
in the perceived image reconstruction quality compared with the standard
GAN-based training approach.

representations of gauge groups. Let $\Xi \rightarrow M$ be a principal fiber
bundle, and let $\Gamma_{c}(M,\mathrm{Ad}(\Xi))$ be the group of compactly
supported (local) gauge transformations. If $P$ is a group of `space-time

representation of $\Gamma_{c}(M,\mathrm{Ad}(\Xi))\rtimes P$ is of positive
energy if every `timelike generator' $p_0 \in \mathfrak{p}$ gives rise to a

  Our main result shows that in the absence of fixed points for the cone of
timelike generators, the projective positive energy representations of the
connected component $\Gamma_{c}(M,\mathrm{Ad}(\Xi))_0$ come from 1-dimensional
$P$-orbits. For compact $M$ this yields a complete classification of the

classification under further restrictions on the space of ground states.

trace a curve (which we call the heat curve) which remains in the moment cone

of R packages that share a high-level design philosophy and low-level grammar

transmission between two ports - is an important phenomenon typically exhibited
by two-dimensional chiral systems. Here, we study this phenomenon in chiral
plasmonic metasurfaces supporting lattice plasmons modes. We show, both
numerically and experimentally, that asymmetric transmission can be achieved
through an unbalanced excitation of such lattice modes by circularly polarized
light of opposite handedness. The excitation efficiencies of the lattice modes,
and hence the strength of the asymmetric transmission, can be controlled by
engineering the in-plane scattering of the individual plasmonic nanoparticles
such that the maximum scattering imbalance occurs along one of the in-plane
diffraction orders of the metasurface. Our study also shows that, contrary to
the case of a non-diffractive metasurface, the lattice-plasmon-enabled
asymmetric transmission can occur at normal incidence for cases where the
metasurface is composed of chiral or achiral nanoparticles possessing 4-fold
rotational symmetry.

of time for the resource or service as long as there is an upfront guarantee
that service will be ultimately provided within a certain delay. Motivated by
this, we present a setting with patient and impatient agents who seek a
resource or service that replenishes periodically. Impatient agents demand the
resource immediately upon arrival while patient agents are willing to wait a
short period conditioned on an upfront commitment to receive the resource. We
study this setting under adversarial arrival models using a relaxed notion of
competitive ratio. We present a class of POLYtope-based Resource Allocation

Such POLYRA algorithms work by consulting a particular polytope and only making
decisions that guarantee the algorithm's state remains feasible in this

algorithms can obtain the optimal competitive ratio. To design these polytopes,
we construct an upper bound on the competitive ratio of any algorithm, which is
characterized via a linear program (LP) that considers a collection of
overlapping worst-case input sequences. Our designed POLYRA algorithms then
mimic the optimal solution of this upper bound LP via its polytope's

three types, our overlapping worst-case input sequences do not necessarily
result in an attainable competitive ratio, and so we present a class of simple

potential energy of a system of atoms given their positions in space and
species. IPs treat atoms as classical particles without explicitly modeling
electrons and thus are computationally far less expensive than first-principles
methods, enabling molecular simulations of significantly larger systems over
longer times. Developing an IP is a complex iterative process involving
multiple steps: assembling a training set, designing a functional form,
optimizing the function parameters, testing model quality, and deployment to
molecular simulation packages. This paper introduces the KIM-based
learning-integrated fitting framework (KLIFF), a package that facilitates the
entire IP development process. KLIFF supports both physics-based and machine
learning IPs. It adopts a modular approach whereby various components in the
fitting process, such as atomic environment descriptors, functional forms, loss
functions, optimizers, quality analyzers, and so on, work seamlessly with each
other. This provides a flexible framework for the rapid design of new IP forms.
Trained IPs are compatible with the Knowledgebase of Interatomic Models (KIM)
application programming interface (API) and can be readily used in major
materials simulation packages compatible with KIM, including ASE, DL_POLY,
GULP, LAMMPS, and QC. KLIFF is written in Python with computationally intensive
components implemented in C++. It is parallelized over data and supports both
shared-memory multicore desktop machines and high-performance distributed
memory computing clusters. We demonstrate the use of KLIFF by fitting a
physics-based Stillinger--Weber potential and a machine learning neural network

atomic motion to the much narrower cavity-dressed atomic resonance frequency.
We discuss and optimize the conditions in which the scattering properties of
single photons from the atom-cavity system become highly entangled with the

expression for the current involves a numerically computed multiplicative
correction term similar to a mobility. The correction accounts for the fact
that, unusually, the local equilibrium distribution of the process is not a
local Gibbs measure even though the global equilibrium distribution is Gibbs.
We give definitive numerical evidence of this fact, originally suggested in
Gao, et. al., Pure and Applied Analysis (2021). In that paper, an approximate

Our main contribution is to present a numerical method to compute the corrected
macroscopic current, which is given by a function of the third spatial
derivative of the height profile. Our method exploits properties of the local
equilibrium (LE) state of the third order finite difference process. We find
that the LE state of this process is not only useful for deriving the PDE; it
also enjoys nonstandard properties which are interesting in their own right.
Namely, we demonstrate that the LE state is a ""rough LE"", a novel kind of LE

or conduct uniform surveillance of the area. In either case, he can only
observe one relay at a time. We evaluate the system performance by the
covertness probability and the message passing delay. In our protocol, Alice
splits her message to increase the covertness probability and adds (coded)
redundancy to reduce the transmission delay. The performance metrics depend on
the graph, communications delay, and code parameters. We show that, in most
scenarios, it is impossible to find the design parameters that simultaneously
maximize the covertness probability and minimize the message delay.

of problems related to domain adaptation. Feature similarity includes both the
invariance of marginal distributions and the closeness of conditional
distributions given the desired response $y$ (e.g., class labels).
Unfortunately, traditional methods always learn such features without fully
taking into consideration the information in $y$, which in turn may lead to a
mismatch of the conditional distributions or the mix-up of discriminative
structures underlying data distributions. In this work, we introduce the
recently proposed von Neumann conditional divergence to improve the
transferability across multiple domains. We show that this new divergence is
differentiable and eligible to easily quantify the functional dependence
between features and $y$. Given multiple source tasks, we integrate this
divergence to capture discriminative information in $y$ and design novel
learning objectives assuming those source tasks are observed either
simultaneously or sequentially. In both scenarios, we obtain favorable
performance against state-of-the-art methods in terms of smaller generalization
error on new tasks and less catastrophic forgetting on source tasks (in the
sequential setup).

poses a huge workload of annotation. Motivated by alleviating this workload, we
propose a general embeddable method to decrease the usage of labeled real
images, using active generated synthetic images. In each active learning
iteration, the most informative unlabeled images are first queried by active
learning and then labeled. Next, synthetic images are generated based on these
selected images. The instruments and backgrounds are cropped out and randomly
combined with each other with blending and fusion near the boundary. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on 2 sinus surgery datasets

the user has interacted with), and in a summative format after a decision has
been made (by comparing the distribution of user interactions to the underlying

authors and may be described equivalently as algebras for the tensor product of

was first introduced by Wraith and generalizes the notion of centralizer clone
in universal algebra. Working in the general setting of enriched algebraic
theories for a system of arities, we study the interaction of the concepts of
bifold algebra and commutant. We show that the notion of commutant arises via a
universal construction in a two-sided fibration of bifold algebras over various
theories. On this basis, we study special classes of bifold algebras that are
related to commutants, introducing the notions of commutant bifold algebra and
balanced bifold algebra. We establish several adjunctions and equivalences
among these categories of bifold algebras and related categories of algebras
over various theories, including commutative, contracommutative, saturated, and
balanced algebras. We also survey and develop examples of commutant bifold
algebras, including examples that employ Pontryagin duality and a theorem of
Ehrenfeucht and {\L}o\'s on reflexive abelian groups. Along the way, we develop
a functorial treatment of fundamental aspects of bifold algebras and

$\Delta\lambda_{res}=$11 nm, surpassing its linewidth. We contrast the
properties of quasi-BIC modulators by studying also guided mode resonances that

scenes, salient object detection (SOD) plays an essential role in various
computer vision systems. Coming to the era of high resolution, SOD methods are
facing new challenges. The major limitation of previous methods is that they
try to identify the salient regions and estimate the accurate objects
boundaries simultaneously with a single regression task at low-resolution. This
practice ignores the inherent difference between the two difficult problems,
resulting in poor detection quality. In this paper, we propose a novel deep
learning framework for high-resolution SOD task, which disentangles the task
into a low-resolution saliency classification network (LRSCN) and a
high-resolution refinement network (HRRN). As a pixel-wise classification task,
LRSCN is designed to capture sufficient semantics at low-resolution to identify
the definite salient, background and uncertain image regions. HRRN is a
regression task, which aims at accurately refining the saliency value of pixels
in the uncertain region to preserve a clear object boundary at high-resolution
with limited GPU memory. It is worth noting that by introducing uncertainty
into the training process, our HRRN can well address the high-resolution
refinement task without using any high-resolution training data. Extensive
experiments on high-resolution saliency datasets as well as some widely used
saliency benchmarks show that the proposed method achieves superior performance
compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

large-scale neutral hydrogen surveys, and this method has great potential for
measuring dark-energy parameters. Some 21 cm IM experiments aiming at measuring
dark energy in the redshift range of $0<z<3$ have been proposed and performed,
in which the typical ones using single-dish mode include e.g., BINGO, FAST, and
SKA1-MID, and those using interferometric mode include e.g., HIRAX, CHIME, and
Tianlai. In this work, we make a forecast for these typical 21 cm IM
experiments on their capability of measuring parameters of dark energy. We find
that the interferometers have great advantages in constraining cosmological
parameters. In particular, the Tianlai cylinder array alone can achieve the
standard of precision cosmology for the $\Lambda$CDM model (i.e., the precision
of parameters is better than 1%). However, for constraining dynamical dark
energy, we find that SKA1-MID performs very well. We show that the simulated 21
cm IM data can break the parameter degeneracies inherent in the CMB data, and
CMB+SKA1-MID offers $\sigma(w)=0.013$ in the $w$CDM model, and
$\sigma(w_0)=0.080$ and $\sigma(w_a)=0.25$ in the CPL model. Compared with
CMB+BAO+SN, Tianlai can provide tighter constraints in $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM,
but looser constraints (tighter than CMB+BAO) in CPL, and the combination
CMB+BAO+SN+Tianlai gives $\sigma(w)=0.013$, $\sigma(w_0)=0.055$, and
$\sigma(w_a)=0.13$. In addition, it is found that the synergy of FAST
($0<z<0.35$)+SKA1-MID ($0.35<z<0.77$)+Tianlai ($0.77<z<2.55$) offers a very
promising survey strategy. Finally, we find that the residual foreground
contamination amplitude has a considerable impact on constraint results. We
show that in the future 21 cm IM experiments will provide a powerful probe for
exploring the nature of dark energy.

target domain. These shifts may span different dimensions such as fog,
rainfall, etc. However, recent methods typically do not consider explicit prior
knowledge about the domain shifts on a specific dimension, thus leading to less
desired adaptation performance. In this paper, we study a practical setting
called Specific Domain Adaptation (SDA) that aligns the source and target
domains in a demanded-specific dimension. Within this setting, we observe the
intra-domain gap induced by different domainness (i.e., numerical magnitudes of
domain shifts in this dimension) is crucial when adapting to a specific domain.
To address the problem, we propose a novel Self-Adversarial Disentangling (SAD)
framework. In particular, given a specific dimension, we first enrich the
source domain by introducing a domainness creator with providing additional
supervisory signals. Guided by the created domainness, we design a
self-adversarial regularizer and two loss functions to jointly disentangle the
latent representations into domainness-specific and domainness-invariant
features, thus mitigating the intra-domain gap. Our method can be easily taken
as a plug-and-play framework and does not introduce any extra costs in the
inference time. We achieve consistent improvements over state-of-the-art
methods in both object detection and semantic segmentation.

can be challenging due to tumor diversity and lack of intraoperative pathology

  Objective: To develop an independent and parallel intraoperative pathology
workflow that can provide rapid and accurate skull base tumor diagnoses using
label-free optical imaging and artificial intelligence.
  Method: We used a fiber laser-based, label-free, non-consumptive,
high-resolution microscopy method ($<$ 60 sec per 1 $\times$ 1 mm$^\text{2}$),
called stimulated Raman histology (SRH), to image a consecutive, multicenter
cohort of skull base tumor patients. SRH images were then used to train a
convolutional neural network (CNN) model using three representation learning
strategies: cross-entropy, self-supervised contrastive learning, and supervised
contrastive learning. Our trained CNN models were tested on a held-out,
multicenter SRH dataset.
  Results: SRH was able to image the diagnostic features of both benign and
malignant skull base tumors. Of the three representation learning strategies,
supervised contrastive learning most effectively learned the distinctive and
diagnostic SRH image features for each of the skull base tumor types. In our
multicenter testing set, cross-entropy achieved an overall diagnostic accuracy
of 91.5%, self-supervised contrastive learning 83.9%, and supervised
contrastive learning 96.6%. Our trained model was able to identify tumor-normal
margins and detect regions of microscopic tumor infiltration in whole-slide SRH
images.
  Conclusion: SRH with trained artificial intelligence models can provide rapid
and accurate intraoperative analysis of skull base tumor specimens to inform
surgical decision-making.

level, and output level. However, almost all of them largely neglect the
contextual dependency, which is generally shared across different domains,
leading to less-desired performance. In this paper, we propose a novel
Context-Aware Mixup (CAMix) framework for domain adaptive semantic

explicit prior knowledge in a fully end-to-end trainable manner for enhancing
the adaptability toward the target domain. Firstly, we present a contextual
mask generation strategy by leveraging the accumulated spatial distributions
and prior contextual relationships. The generated contextual mask is critical
in this work and will guide the context-aware domain mixup on three different
levels. Besides, provided the context knowledge, we introduce a
significance-reweighted consistency loss to penalize the inconsistency between
the mixed student prediction and the mixed teacher prediction, which alleviates
the negative transfer of the adaptation, e.g., early performance degradation.
Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our method

support the execution of diverse latency-sensitive and computation-intensive
IoT applications. Although some frameworks attempt to provide such integration,
there are still several challenges to be addressed, such as dynamic scheduling
of different IoT applications, scalability mechanisms, multi-platform support,
and supporting different interaction models. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a lightweight and distributed container-based framework, called
FogBus2. It provides a mechanism for scheduling heterogeneous IoT applications
and implements several scheduling policies. Also, it proposes an optimized
genetic algorithm to obtain fast convergence to well-suited solutions. Besides,
it offers a scalability mechanism to ensure efficient responsiveness when
either the number of IoT devices increases or the resources become
overburdened. Also, the dynamic resource discovery mechanism of FogBus2 assists
new entities to quickly join the system. We have also developed two IoT
applications, called Conway's Game of Life and Video Optical Character

In this work, we introduce an online system for joint beat, downbeat, and meter

a pair of sequential Monte Carlo particle filters applied during inference. The

field of failure prevention. Fast prevention means lower repair costs and
losses. The amount of sensors in novel industry systems makes the anomaly
detection process quite difficult for humans. Algorithms which automates the
process of detecting anomalies are crucial in modern failure-prevention
systems. Therefore, many machine and deep learning models have been designed to
address this problem. Mostly, they are autoencoder-based architectures with
some generative adversarial elements. In this work, a framework is shown which
incorporates neuroevolution methods to boost the anomaly-detection scores of
new and already known models. The presented approach adapts evolution
strategies for evolving ensemble model, in which every single model works on a
subgroup of data sensors. The next goal of neuroevolution is to optimise
architecture and hyperparameters like window size, the number of layers, layer
depths, etc. The proposed framework shows that it is possible to boost most of
the anomaly detection deep learning models in a reasonable time and a fully
automated mode. The tests were run on SWAT and WADI datasets. To our knowledge,
this is the first approach in which an ensemble deep learning anomaly detection

models learn to compute a ranking score between the given query and document.
The majority of existing models are trained in pairwise fashion using
human-judged labels directly without further calibration. The traditional
pairwise schemes can be time-consuming and require pre-defined
positive-negative document pairs for training, potentially leading to learning
bias due to document distribution mismatch between training and test
conditions. Some popular existing listwise schemes rely on the strong
pre-defined probabilistic assumptions and stark difference between relevant and
non-relevant documents for the given query, which may limit the model potential
due to the low-quality or ambiguous relevance labels. To address these
concerns, we turn to a physics-inspired ranking balance scheme and propose
PoolRank, a pooling-based listwise learning framework. The proposed scheme has
four major advantages: (1) PoolRank extracts training information from the best
candidates at the local level based on model performance and relative ranking
among abundant document candidates. (2) By combining four pooling-based loss
components in a multi-task learning fashion, PoolRank calibrates the ranking
balance for the partially relevant and the highly non-relevant documents
automatically without costly human inspection. (3) PoolRank can be easily
generalized to any neural retrieval model without requiring additional
learnable parameters or model structure modifications. (4) Compared to pairwise
learning and existing listwise learning schemes, PoolRank yields better ranking
performance for all studied retrieval models while retaining efficient
convergence rates.

development of the discipline. Domain experts are interested in error measures
relevant for their decision making needs. Such measures may produce unreliable
results. Although reliability properties of several metrics have already been
discussed, it has hardly been quantified in an objective way. We propose a
measure named Rank Stability, which evaluates how much the rankings of an
experiment differ in between similar datasets, when the models and errors are
constant. We use this to study the evaluation setup of the M5. We find that the
evaluation setup of the M5 is less reliable than other measures. The main
drivers of instability are hierarchical aggregation and scaling.
Price-weighting reduces the stability of all tested error measures. Scale
normalization of the M5 error measure results in less stability than other
scale-free errors. Hierarchical levels taken separately are less stable with
more aggregation, and their combination is even less stable than individual
levels. We also show positive tradeoffs of retaining aggregation importance
without affecting stability. Aggregation and stability can be linked to the
influence of much debated magic numbers. Many of our findings can be applied to
general hierarchical forecast benchmarking.

approach that enables users with limited programming experience to program
collaborative applications for human-robot interaction. Allowing end users,

make it easy to ""retask"" robots from one process to another, facilitating their
adoption by small and medium enterprises. Our approach builds on the paradigm
of trigger-action programming (TAP) by allowing end users to create rich
interactions through simple trigger-action pairings. It enables end users to
iteratively create, edit, and refine a reactive robot program while executing
partial programs. This live programming approach enables the user to utilize
the task space and objects by incrementally specifying situated trigger-action
pairs, substantially lowering the barrier to entry for programming or
reprogramming robots for collaboration. We instantiate situated live
programming in an authoring system where users can create trigger-action
programs by annotating an augmented video feed from the robot's perspective and
assign robot actions to trigger conditions. We evaluated this system in a study
where participants (n = 10) developed robot programs for solving collaborative
light-manufacturing tasks. Results showed that users with little programming
experience were able to program HRC tasks in an interactive fashion and our
situated live programming approach further supported individualized strategies

of the interaction between this hidden sector and the black hole enforced by
the self-consistency. Despite the expressive power of the model, we arrive at
several qualitative statements. Furthermore, we identify these statements as
features inside the microscopic density of states of the horizon quanta, with
the dimension of the configuration space being associated with the area per
quanta in Planck unit, a UV cutoff proportional to the amount of excess entropy
relative to Bekenstein's law at the end of evaporation, and a
zero-frequency-pole-like structure corresponding to, similarly, the amount of
excess entropy at IR limit. We then relate this nearly-zero-frequency structure
to the soft hairs proposed by Strominger et al., and argue that we should
consider deviating away from the zero frequency limit for soft hairs to
participate in the black hole evaporation.

to obtain in real-world scenarios. Recently, several GAN-based methods have

this paper, we propose a simple but powerful end-to-end Chinese calligraphy

redundant preprocessing to generate fine-grained target-style characters with
few-shot references. To be specific, a few paired samples from different

structures underlying different glyphs. To capture valuable style knowledge in
target and strengthen the coarse-grained understanding of character content, we
utilize multiple unpaired samples to align the feature distributions belonging

emerging. This technology promises to provide information on propagation
environments and transceivers' location, thus creating several new services and
applications for the Internet of Things and environment-aware communication.
Using crowdsourcing data collected by multiple agents appears to be much
potential for enhancing SLAM performance. However, the measurement
uncertainties in practice and biased estimations from multiple agents may
result in serious errors. This study develops a robust SLAM method with
measurement plug-and-play and crowdsourcing mechanisms to address the above
problems. First, we divide measurements into different categories according to
their unknown biases and realize a measurement plug-and-play mechanism by
extending the classic belief propagation (BP)-based SLAM method. The proposed
mechanism can obtain the time-varying agent location, radio features, and
corresponding measurement biases (such as clock bias, orientation bias, and
received signal strength model parameters), with high accuracy and robustness
in challenging scenarios without any prior information on anchors and agents.
Next, we establish a probabilistic crowdsourcing-based SLAM mechanism, in which
multiple agents cooperate to construct and refine the radio map in a
decentralized manner. Our study presents the first BP-based crowdsourcing that
resolves the ""double count"" and ""data reliability"" problems through the
flexible application of probabilistic data association methods. Numerical
results reveal that the crowdsourcing mechanism can further improve the
accuracy of the mapping result, which, in turn, ensures the decimeter-level
localization accuracy of each agent in a challenging propagation environment.

types. In this paper, we present a novel approach of directly learning deep
embeddings for brain tumor types, which can be used for downstream tasks such
as classification. Along with using triplet loss variants, our approach applies
contrastive learning to performing unsupervised pre-training, combined with a
rare-case data augmentation module to effectively ameliorate the lack of data
problem in the brain tumor imaging analysis domain. We evaluate our method on
an extensive brain tumor dataset which consists of 27 different tumor classes,
out of which 13 are defined as rare. With a common encoder during all the
experiments, we compare our approach with a baseline classification-layer based
model, and the results well prove the effectiveness of our approach across all
measured metrics.

strategy for visual scene interpretation in the open- world setting. However,
it remains challenging to acquire novel classes in an online fashion for the
segmentation task, mainly due to its continuously-evolving semantic label
space, partial pixelwise ground-truth annotations, and constrained data
availability. To ad- dress this, we propose an incremental learning strategy
that can fast adapt deep segmentation models without catastrophic forgetting,
using a streaming input data with pixel annotations on the novel classes only.
To this end, we develop a uni ed learning strategy based on the
Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework, which integrates an iterative
relabeling strategy that lls in the missing labels and a rehearsal-based
incremental learning step that balances the stability-plasticity of the model.
Moreover, our EM algorithm adopts an adaptive sampling method to select
informative train- ing data and a class-balancing training strategy in the
incremental model updates, both improving the e cacy of model learning. We
validate our approach on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and ADE20K datasets, and the

object detection and segmentation have seen a great improvement in performance.
However, in many real-world applications such as autonomous driving vehicles,
the risk associated with incorrect predictions of objects is very high.
Standard deep learning models for object detection such as YOLO models are
often overconfident in their predictions and do not take into account the
uncertainty in predictions on out-of-distribution data. In this work, we
propose an efficient and effective approach to model uncertainty in object
detection and segmentation tasks using Monte-Carlo DropBlock (MC-DropBlock)
based inference. The proposed approach applies drop-block during training time
and test time on the convolutional layer of the deep learning models such as
YOLO. We show that this leads to a Bayesian convolutional neural network
capable of capturing the epistemic uncertainty in the model. Additionally, we
capture the aleatoric uncertainty using a Gaussian likelihood. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach on modeling uncertainty in object

Experimental results show that MC-DropBlock improves the generalization,
calibration, and uncertainty modeling capabilities of YOLO models in object

thermomechanical force noise and the thermal decoherence rate of mechanical
quantum states. While the dissipation rate is typically set by the bulk
acoustic properties of the material, by exploiting dissipation dilution,
mechanical $Q$ can be engineered through geometry and increased by many orders
of magnitude. Recently, soft clamping in combination with strain engineering
has enabled room temperature quality factors approaching one billion ($10^9$)
in millimeter-scale resonators. Here we demonstrate a new approach to soft
clamping which exploits vibrations in the perimeter of polygon-shaped
resonators tethered at their vertices. In contrast to previous approaches,
which rely on cascaded elements to achieve soft clamping, perimeter modes are
soft clamped due to symmetry and the boundary conditions at the polygon
vertices. Perimeter modes reach $Q$ of 3.6 billion at room temperature while
spanning only two acoustic wavelengths -- a 4-fold improvement over the
state-of-the-art mechanical $Q$ with 10-fold smaller devices. The small size of
our devices makes them well-suited for near-field integration with
microcavities for quantum optomechanical experiments. Moreover, their
compactness allows the realization of phononic lattices. We demonstrate a

understanding, and effective fusion of features with different semantic
representations can significantly improve the model's performance on salient

salient object detection. Firstly, a multi-receptive enhancement module (MRE)
is designed to effectively expand the receptive fields of features from
different layers and generate features with different receptive fields. MRE can
enhance the semantic representation and improve the model's perception of the
image context, which enables the model to locate the salient object accurately.
Secondly, in order to reduce the reuse of redundant information in the complex
top-down fusion method and weaken the differences between semantic features, a
relatively simple but effective parallel fusion strategy (PFS) is proposed. It
allows multi-scale features to better interact with each other, thus improving
the overall performance of the model. Experimental results on multiple datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods under

Therefore, transferring knowledge pertaining to temporal relations is critical
for this task which is missing in the previous cross-modal KD frameworks. To
this end, we aim at learning an augmented RGB representation for action
detection, taking advantage of additional modalities at training time through
KD. We propose a KD framework consisting of two levels of distillation. On one
hand, atomic-level distillation encourages the RGB student to learn the
sub-representation of the actions from the teacher in a contrastive manner. On
the other hand, sequence-level distillation encourages the student to learn the
temporal knowledge from the teacher, which consists of transferring the Global
Contextual Relations and the Action Boundary Saliency. The result is an
Augmented-RGB stream that can achieve competitive performance as the two-stream

Partly because of the subject, this has received little attention outside the

$j_{*}$ from the SPARC database containing Spitzer 3.6 $\mu$m photometry and
accurate H I rotation curves from Lelli et al. using a sample of 38 LSBGs and
82 HSBGs. We do this with the objective of comparing both galaxy populations,
finding that LSBGs are higher in the Fall relation by about 0.174 dex.
Additionally, we apply and test different masses and formation models to
estimate the spin parameter $\lambda$, which quantifies the rotation obtained
from the tidal torque theory, finding no clear evidence of a difference in the
spin of LSBGs and HSBGs under a classic disk formation model that assumes the
ratio ($f_{j}$) between $j_{*}$ and the specific AM of the halo is $\sim 1$. In
another respect, by using the biased collapse model, where $f_{j}$ depends on
the star formation efficiency, it was found that LSBGs clearly show higher spin
values, having an average spin of $\sim 2$ times the average spin of HSBGs.
This latter result is consistent with those obtained from simulations by

anchor-based methods, while the efficient but challenging anchor-free
single-stage 3D object detection is not well investigated. Recent studies on 2D
object detection show that the anchor-free methods also are of great potential.
However, the unordered and sparse properties of point clouds prevent us from
directly leveraging the advanced 2D methods on 3D point clouds. We overcome
this by converting the voxel-based sparse 3D feature volumes into the sparse 2D
feature maps. We propose an attentive module to fit the sparse feature maps to
dense mostly on the object regions through the deformable convolution tower and
the supervised mask-guided attention. By directly regressing the 3D bounding
box from the enhanced and dense feature maps, we construct a novel single-stage
3D detector for point clouds in an anchor-free manner. We propose an IoU-based
detection confidence re-calibration scheme to improve the correlation between
the detection confidence score and the accuracy of the bounding box regression.

information compared with monocular images and have facilitated a wide range of
measurement applications. Light field image capturing devices usually suffer
from the inherent trade-off between the angular and spatial resolutions. To
tackle this problem, several methods, such as light field reconstruction and
light field super-resolution, have been proposed but leaving two problems
unaddressed, namely domain asymmetry and efficient information flow. In this
paper, we propose an end-to-end Spatio-Angular Dense Network (SADenseNet) for
light field reconstruction with two novel components, namely correlation blocks
and spatio-angular dense skip connections to address them. The former performs
effective modeling of the correlation information in a way that conforms with
the domain asymmetry. And the latter consists of three kinds of connections
enhancing the information flow within two domains. Extensive experiments on
both real-world and synthetic datasets have been conducted to demonstrate that
the proposed SADenseNet's state-of-the-art performance at significantly reduced
costs in memory and computation. The qualitative results show that the
reconstructed light field images are sharp with correct details and can serve
as pre-processing to improve the accuracy of related measurement applications.

strategy, which aims to learn deep representations of the whole target for
localizing the target. It is arduous for such methods to track targets with
various appearance variations. To address this limitation, another type of
methods adopts a part-based tracking strategy which divides the target into
equal patches and tracks all these patches in parallel. The target state is
inferred by summarizing the tracking results of these patches. A potential
limitation of such trackers is that not all patches are equally informative for
tracking. Some patches that are not discriminative may have adverse effects. In
this paper, we propose to track the salient local parts of the target that are
discriminative for tracking. In particular, we propose a fine-grained saliency
mining module to capture the local saliencies. Further, we design a
saliency-association modeling module to associate the captured saliencies
together to learn effective correlation representations between the exemplar

diverse datasets demonstrate that the proposed method performs favorably
against state-of-the-art trackers.

recover a similar level of correlation between DESI quasar targets and SDSS

  Dimension Curves","33 pages, 11 figures, 6 tables",,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The time series of fractal dimension values of urban form always take on
sigmoid curves. The basic model of these curves is logistic function. From the
logistic model of fractal dimension curves, we can derive the growth rate
formula and acceleration formula of city development. Using the inflexions of
the fractal parameter curves, we can identify the different phases of urban
evolution. The main results are as follows. (1) Based on the curve of fractal
dimension of urban form, urban growth can be divided into four stages: initial
slow growth, accelerated fast growth, decelerated fast growth, and terminal
slow growth. The three dividing points are 0.2113Dmax, 0.5Dmax, and 0.7887Dmax,
where Dmax is the capacity of fractal dimension. When the fractal dimension
reaches half of its capacity value, 0.5Dmax, the urban growth rate reaches its
peak. (2) Based on the curve of fractal dimension odds, urban growth can also
be divided into four stages: initial slow filling, accelerated fast filling,
decelerated fast filling, terminal slow filling. The three dividing points are
0.2113Zmax, 0.5Zmax, and 0.7887Zmax, where Zmax=/(2-Dmax) denotes the capacity
of fractal dimension odds (Dmax<2). Empirical analyses show that the first
scheme based fractal dimension is suitable for the young cities and the second
scheme based on fractal dimension odds can be applied to mature cities. A
conclusion can be reached that logistic function is one of significant model
for the stage division of urban growth based on fractal parameters of cities.
The results of this study provide a new way of understanding the features and
mechanism of urban phase transition.

academic, industrial and art communities due to its flexibility in enabling
various applications. Existing solutions either attentively fuse deep style
feature into deep content feature without considering feature distributions, or
adaptively normalize deep content feature according to the style such that
their global statistics are matched. Although effective, leaving shallow
feature unexplored and without locally considering feature statistics, they are
prone to unnatural output with unpleasing local distortions. To alleviate this
problem, in this paper, we propose a novel attention and normalization module,
named Adaptive Attention Normalization (AdaAttN), to adaptively perform
attentive normalization on per-point basis. Specifically, spatial attention
score is learnt from both shallow and deep features of content and style
images. Then per-point weighted statistics are calculated by regarding a style
feature point as a distribution of attention-weighted output of all style
feature points. Finally, the content feature is normalized so that they
demonstrate the same local feature statistics as the calculated per-point
weighted style feature statistics. Besides, a novel local feature loss is
derived based on AdaAttN to enhance local visual quality. We also extend
AdaAttN to be ready for video style transfer with slight modifications.
Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art arbitrary

crustal moment of inertia of the Vela pulsar should be about 7\% for a mass
higher than about 1$M_\odot$. However, an important study which requires
investigation of pulsational stability and gravitational binding of the models
of Negi et al. (1989) has not been carried out so far. The present paper deals
with such a study of the models (Negi et al. 1989) for all permissible values
of the compactness parameter $u (\equiv M/a$, total mass to size ratio in
geometrized units) and compressibility factor $Q$ (defined in Tolman's VII
solution as: $ x = r^2/K^2 = r^2/a^2Q)$. It is seen that the configurations
remain pulsationally stable and gravitationally bound for all permissible
values of $u (\leq 0.25)$ and $Q$ ($0 < Q \leq 1.2$).

superconductivity occurs typically at the base of a periodic array of
edge-sharing CuO5 pyramids. Virtual transitions of electrons between adjacent
planar Cu and O atoms, occurring at a rate $t/{\hbar}$ and across the
charge-transfer energy gap E, generate 'superexchange' spin-spin interactions
of energy $J\approx4t^4/E^3$ in an antiferromagnetic correlated-insulator
state. However, Hole doping the CuO2 plane converts this into a very high
temperature superconducting state whose electron-pairing is exceptional. A
leading proposal for the mechanism of this intense electron-pairing is that,
while hole doping destroys magnetic order it preserves pair-forming
superexchange interactions governed by the charge-transfer energy scale E. To
explore this hypothesis directly at atomic-scale, we combine single-electron
and electron-pair (Josephson) scanning tunneling microscopy to visualize the
interplay of E and the electron-pair density nP in ${Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+x}}$.
The responses of both E and nP to alterations in the distance {\delta} between
planar Cu and apical O atoms are then determined. These data reveal the
empirical crux of strongly correlated superconductivity in CuO2, the response
of the electron-pair condensate to varying the charge transfer energy.
Concurrence of predictions from strong-correlation theory for hole-doped
charge-transfer insulators with these observations, indicates that
charge-transfer superexchange is the electron-pairing mechanism of
superconductive ${Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+x}}$.

E. coli or C. reinhardtii display phenomena unseen in conventional equilibrium
systems, including strongly enhanced diffusivity relative to the Brownian value

these phenomena have typically been explained by the hydrodynamic advection of
point tracers by isolated microswimmers, while, at higher concentrations,
correlations between pusher microswimmers such as E. coli can increase the
effective diffusivity even further. Anisotropic tracers in active suspensions
can be expected to exhibit even more complex behaviour than spherical ones, due
to the presence of a nontrivial translation-rotation coupling. Using
large-scale lattice Boltzmann simulations of model microswimmers described by
extended force dipoles, we study the motion of ellipsoidal point tracers
immersed in 3-dimensional microswimmer suspensions. We find that the rotational
diffusivity of tracers is much less affected by swimmer-swimmer correlations
than the translational diffusivity. We furthermore study the anisotropic
translational diffusion in the particle frame and find that, in pusher
suspensions, the diffusivity along the ellipsoid major axis is higher than in
the direction perpendicular to it, albeit with a smaller ratio than for
Brownian diffusion. Thus, we find that far field hydrodynamics cannot account
for the anomalous coupling between translation and rotation observed in
experiments, as was recently proposed. Finally, we study the probability
distributions (PDFs) of translational and rotational displacements. In
accordance with experimental observations, for short observation times we
observe strongly non-Gaussian PDFs that collapse when rescaled with their

ability to track its desired time-varying position trajectory in an
environment, which is herein termed as ""global-position tracking"". This paper
introduces a nonlinear control approach that achieves asymptotic
global-position tracking for three-dimensional (3-D) bipedal robot walking.
Designing a global-position tracking controller presents a challenging problem
due to the complex hybrid robot model and the time-varying desired
global-position trajectory. Towards tackling this problem, the first main
contribution is the construction of impact invariance to ensure all desired
trajectories respect the foot-landing impact dynamics, which is a necessary
condition for realizing asymptotic tracking of hybrid walking systems. Thanks
to their independence of the desired global position, these conditions can be
exploited to decouple the higher-level planning of the global position and the
lower-level planning of the remaining trajectories, thereby greatly alleviating
the computational burden of motion planning. The second main contribution is
the Lyapunov-based stability analysis of the hybrid closed-loop system, which
produces sufficient conditions to guide the controller design for achieving
asymptotic global-position tracking during fully actuated walking. Simulations
and experiments on a 3-D bipedal robot with twenty revolute joints confirm the
validity of the proposed control approach in guaranteeing accurate tracking.

that the proof giving the consistency $ \mathfrak{b} = \mathfrak{d} =

  Second point is adding to the results of \S2,\S3 which say that (in \S3 with
no large cardinals) we can force $ {\aleph_1} < \mathfrak{b} = \mathfrak{d} <
\mathfrak{a}$. We like to have $ {\aleph_1} < \mathfrak{s} \le \mathfrak{b} =
\mathfrak{d} < \mathfrak{a} $. For this we allow in \S2,\S3 the sets $ K_t $ to
be uncountable; this requires non-essential changes. In particular, we replace
usually $ {\aleph_0}, {\aleph_1} $ by $ \sigma , \partial $. Naturally we can
deal with $ \mathfrak{i} $ and similar invariants.
  Third we proofread the work again. To get $ \mathfrak{s} $ we could have
retained the countability of the member of the $ I_t$-s but the parameters
would change with $ A \in I_t$, well for a cofinal set of them; but the present
seems simpler.

recent results of Dong, Zheng and Zhou. Our conclusion is also similar to the
case of the gluon Sivers function derived by Boer, Echevarria, Mulders and Zhou

double-logarithmic powers of $\alpha_s \, \ln^2 (1/x)$ with $\alpha_s$ the
strong coupling constant. We solve the corresponding novel evolution equations
in the large-$N_c$ limit, obtaining a sub-eikonal correction to the

MuCoMiD allows automatic feature extraction while incorporating knowledge from
five heterogeneous biological information sources (interactions between

protein-coding genes, miRNA family information, and disease ontology) in a
multi-task setting which is a novel perspective and has not been studied

many research directions, LC duration (LCD) measures the total time it takes
for a vehicle to travel from the current lane to the target lane, which is an
indispensable indicator to characterize the LC behavior. Although existing
research has made some achievements, less attention has been paid to the
research of heavy vehicles' LCD. Therefore, this paper aims to further explore
the LCD between heavy vehicles and passenger cars. LC trajectories are
extracted from the newly-released HighD dataset, which contains of 16.5 hours
of measurement and over 11,000 vehicles. The survival function of LCD has been
estimated, and the characteristic has been analyzed. Thereafter, the
Accelerated Failure Time model is introduced to explore the influencing
factors. Results demonstrate that the MST value of passenger cars and heavy

time-headway and distance-headway with preceding vehicle when performing LC.
Nevertheless, these two factors do not significantly affect the LCD of heavy

knowledge of the agent or environment, the planner learns to model the state
transitions and rewards. To avoid the potentially hazardous trial-and-error of
reinforcement learning, we focus on differentiable planners such as Value
Iteration Networks (VIN), which are trained offline from safe expert
demonstrations. Although they work well in small simulations, we address two
major limitations that hinder their deployment. First, we observed that current
differentiable planners struggle to plan long-term in environments with a high
branching complexity. While they should ideally learn to assign low rewards to
obstacles to avoid collisions, we posit that the constraints imposed on the
network are not strong enough to guarantee the network to learn sufficiently
large penalties for every possible collision. We thus impose a structural
constraint on the value iteration, which explicitly learns to model any
impossible actions. Secondly, we extend the model to work with a limited
perspective camera under translation and rotation, which is crucial for real
robot deployment. Many VIN-like planners assume a 360 degrees or overhead view
without rotation. In contrast, our method uses a memory-efficient lattice map
to aggregate CNN embeddings of partial observations, and models the rotational
dynamics explicitly using a 3D state-space grid (translation and rotation). Our
proposals significantly improve semantic navigation and exploration on several
2D and 3D environments, succeeding in settings that are otherwise challenging

intrinsically topological objects and are recognized as common knowledge shared
among human society activity, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and many
other kinds of nature science and technology. Some important methods used so
far to characterize the topological properties, including topological index,
topological order, topological invariant, topology class and the topology
partition are discussed. The theories of molecular topology, topological
quantum matter including topological insulators, topological metal and
topological superconductors and topological quantum computing are reviewed. The
development of the topological duality connection between the qubit and
singularity via topological space time is briefly introduced. We will see the
use of iterated function systems (IFS)to simulate the connection between
singularities and their qubit control codes. The novel applications of topology
in integrated circuits technology are also discussed in this paper.

inhomogeneous on-site interactions, (pseudo-)magnetic field or inter-layer

on the systems where the stationary equation is reducible into two stationary
equations with $2\times2$ Dirac-type Hamiltonians and auxiliary interactions.
We show that it is possible to find localized states by solving an effective
Schr\""odinger equation with energy-dependent potential. We consider several
scenarios where bilayer graphene is subject to inhomogneous (pseudo-)magnetic

provide analytical solutions for the states localized by local fluctuations or
periodicity defects of the interactions.

unsupervised learning using numerous data mining techniques. Neural networks
often need a greater collection of observations to achieve enough predictive
ability. Due to the increase in the rate of poor graduates, it is necessary to
design a system that helps to reduce this menace as well as reduce the
incidence of students having to repeat due to poor performance or having to
drop out of school altogether in the middle of the pursuit of their career. It
is therefore necessary to study each one as well as their advantages and
disadvantages, so as to determine which is more efficient in and in what case
one should be preferred over the other. The study aims to develop a system to
predict student performance with Artificial Neutral Network using the student
demographic traits so as to assist the university in selecting candidates
(students) with a high prediction of success for admission using previous
academic records of students granted admissions which will eventually lead to
quality graduates of the institution. The model was developed based on certain
selected variables as the input. It achieved an accuracy of over 92.3 percent,
showing Artificial Neural Network potential effectiveness as a predictive tool
and a selection criterion for candidates seeking admission to a university.

one such system which is closer in spirit to Hilbert's axiomatic approach to
Euclidean geometry than to the vector space approach employed by Minkowski. We
present a mechanisation in Isabelle/HOL of the system of axioms as well as
theorems relating to temporal order. Proofs and excerpts of Isabelle/Isar
