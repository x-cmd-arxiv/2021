for a few decades. A particular type of Counterfeit coin puzzle is known in the
literature as the ""Beam balance puzzle"". An abstract solution to it is provided
by Iwama et.al as a modification of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, making
use of quantum parallelism and entanglement. Moreover, during this pandemic,
group testing has proved to be an efficient algorithm to save time and cost of
testing specimens for the presence of infection. In this article, we propose a
""Binary Spring Balance"" (BSB) puzzle, to facilitate a unified picture of the
counterfeit coin problem and the testing for infection problem, as both aim to
reduce the number of queries. We then showcase two solutions to the BSB
problem, one using bits and other using classical-qubits ('cebits"") for
querying. Both solutions are demonstrated using circuits. In this pursuit, we
develop a modified optical implementation of Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm using
only polarizers (no need of beam splitters), which has surprisingly not yet
been proposed earlier. Under the pretext of this demonstration we question why
we have not yet developed testing mechanisms inspired by Bernstein-Vazirani
algorithm for the pandemic, as they solve the problem in single query, they
have no issues related to prevalence of infection in the population, nor are
they plagued by the issue of dilution of samples due to pooling. The modified
implementation of Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm using polarizers can also be a
cost-effective demonstration in an undergraduate lab.

Therefore, if the ""target"" spectral efficiency (SE) is met, it is important to
optimize the uplink EE when setting the transmit powers of the UEs. Also, such
transmit power control (TPC) method must be tested on channel data from
real-world measurements to prove its effectiveness. In this paper, we compare
three different TPC algorithms using zero-forcing reception by applying them to
3.5 GHz channel measurement data featuring ~30,000 possible AP locations and 8
UE locations in a 200mx200m area. We show that the max-min EE algorithm is
highly effective in improving the uplink EE at a target SE, especially if the

the maximum allowed transmit power of the UEs is high.

motility induced phase separation is the precursor to jams. That is, jams are
MIPS seeds that undergo an extra instability due to target accumulation. This
provides a quantitative prediction of the onset density for jamming, and

humanitarian mapping approaches from space are prone to bias in their

if the predictions systematically show prejudice against scheduled caste or

compare villages within a community of interest to synthetic counterfactuals.
Our findings indicate that poverty is systematically overestimated and
electricity systematically underestimated for scheduled tribes in comparison to

electrification overestimated. These results are a warning sign for a variety

satisfaction of music recommender systems. Here, users often listen to the same
track repeatedly and appreciate recommendations of the same song multiple
times. Thus, accounting for users' relistening behavior is critical for music
recommender systems. In this paper, we describe a psychology-informed approach
to model and predict music relistening behavior that is inspired by studies in
music psychology, which relate music preferences to human memory. We adopt a
well-established psychological theory of human cognition that models the
operations of human memory, i.e., Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R).
In contrast to prior work, which uses only the base-level component of ACT-R,
we utilize five components of ACT-R, i.e., base-level, spreading, partial
matching, valuation, and noise, to investigate the effect of five factors on
music relistening behavior: (i) recency and frequency of prior exposure to
tracks, (ii) co-occurrence of tracks, (iii) the similarity between tracks, (iv)
familiarity with tracks, and (v) randomness in behavior. On a dataset of 1.7
million listening events from Last.fm, we evaluate the performance of our
approach by sequentially predicting the next track(s) in user sessions. We find
that recency and frequency of prior exposure to tracks is an effective
predictor of relistening behavior. Besides, considering the co-occurrence of
tracks and familiarity with tracks further improves performance in terms of
R-precision. We hope that our work inspires future research on the merits of
considering cognitive aspects of memory retrieval to model and predict complex
user behavior.

and transport properties along each crystalline axis and reveals that
application of magnetic field, H, along different crystalline axes readily
stretches or shrinks the lattice in a uniaxial manner, resulting in distinct
electronic states. Furthermore, application of modest pressure drastically
amplifies the anisotropic magnetoelastic effect, leading to either an
occurrence of a robust metallic state at H || hard axis or a reentrance of the
nonmetallic state at H || easy axis. Ca3Ru2O7 presents a rare lattice-dependent
magnetotransport mechanism, in which the extraordinary lattice flexibility
enables an exquisite control of the electronic state via magnetically
stretching or shrinking the crystalline axes, and the spin polarization plays
an unconventional role unfavorable for maximizing conductivity. At the heart of
the intriguing physics is the anisotropic magnetostriction that leads to exotic
states.

as possible. Low-latency captioning is needed to realize such functionality,
but this research area for online video captioning has not been pursued yet.
This paper proposes a novel approach to optimize each caption's output timing
based on a trade-off between latency and caption quality. An audio-visual
Trans-former is trained to generate ground-truth captions using only a small
portion of all video frames, and to mimic outputs of a pre-trained Transformer
to which all the frames are given. A CNN-based timing detector is also trained
to detect a proper output timing, where the captions generated by the two
Trans-formers become sufficiently close to each other. With the jointly trained
Transformer and timing detector, a caption can be generated in the early stages
of an event-triggered video clip, as soon as an event happens or when it can be
forecasted. Experiments with the ActivityNet Captions dataset show that our
approach achieves 94% of the caption quality of the upper bound given by the
pre-trained Transformer using the entire video clips, using only 28% of frames

of planet formation and two transiting warm Neptunes near mean-motion
resonances. Here we analyse three transits of AU Mic b observed with the
CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS), supplemented with sector 1 and 27
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) photometry, and the All-Sky
Automated Survey (ASAS) from the ground. The refined orbital period of AU Mic b
is 8.462995 \pm 0.000003 d, whereas the stellar rotational period is
P_{rot}=4.8367 \pm 0.0006 d. The two periods indicate a 7:4 spin--orbit
commensurability at a precision of 0.1%. Therefore, all transits are observed
in front of one of the four possible stellar central longitudes. This is
strongly supported by the observation that the same complex star-spot pattern
is seen in the second and third CHEOPS visits that were separated by four
orbits (and seven stellar rotations). Using a bootstrap analysis we find that
flares and star spots reduce the accuracy of transit parameters by up to 10% in
the planet-to-star radius ratio and the accuracy on transit time by 3-4
minutes. Nevertheless, occulted stellar spot features independently confirm the
presence of transit timing variations (TTVs) with an amplitude of at least 4
minutes. We find that the outer companion, AU Mic c may cause the observed
TTVs.

transition region (TR) commonly show persistent downflows of the order of
10--15 km/s. The cause of such downflows, however, is still not fully clear and
has remained a matter of debate. We aim to understand the cause of such
downflows by studying the coronal and TR responses to the recently reported
chromospheric downflowing rapid red shifted excursions (RREs), and their impact
on heating the solar atmosphere. We have used two sets of coordinated data from
SST, IRIS, and SDO for analyzing the response of the downflowing RREs in the TR
and corona. To provide theoretical support, we use an already existing 2.5D MHD
simulation of spicules performed with the Bifrost code. We find ample
occurrences of downflowing RREs and show several examples of their
spatio-temporal evolution, sampling multiple wavelength channels ranging from
the cooler chromospheric to hotter coronal channels. These downflowing features
are thought to be likely associated with the returning components of the
previously heated spicular plasma. Furthermore, the TR Doppler shifts
associated with them are close to the average red shifts observed in this
region which further implies that these flows could (partly) be responsible for
the persistent downflows observed in the TR. We also propose two mechanisms (a
typical upflow followed by a downflow and downflows along a loop), from the
perspective of numerical simulation, that could explain the ubiquitous
occurrence of such downflows. A detailed comparison between the synthetic and
observed spectral characteristics, reveals a distinctive match, and further
suggests an impact on the heating of the solar atmosphere. We present evidence
that suggests that at least some of the downflowing RREs are the chromospheric
counterparts of the TR and lower coronal downflows.

attempts have been made in quantifying the uncertainty in image segmentation

strictly Gaussian. In this paper, we propose to use a more flexible approach by
introducing Normalizing Flows (NFs), which enables the learnt densities to be
more complex and facilitate more accurate modeling for uncertainty. We prove
this hypothesis by adopting the Probabilistic U-Net and augmenting the
posterior density with an NF, allowing it to be more expressive. Our
qualitative as well as quantitative (GED and IoU) evaluations on the
multi-annotated and single-annotated LIDC-IDRI and Kvasir-SEG segmentation

the quantification of aleatoric uncertainty and the increased predictive
performance of up to 14 percent. This result strongly indicates that a more
flexible density model should be seriously considered in architectures that
attempt to capture segmentation ambiguity through density modeling. The benefit
of this improved modeling will increase human confidence in annotation and

factorization of Dedekind's group determinant. In this paper, we consider the
case of the semigroup determinant. The semigroup determinant is nonzero if and
only if the complex semigroup algebra is Frobenius, and so our results include
applications to the study of Frobenius semigroup algebras. We explicitly factor
the semigroup determinant for commutative semigroups and inverse semigroups. We
recover the Wilf-Lindstr\""om factorization of the semigroup determinant of a
meet semilattice and Wood's factorization for a finite commutative chain ring.
The former was motivated by combinatorics and the latter by coding theory over
finite rings. We prove that the algebra of the multiplicative semigroup of a
finite Frobenius ring is Frobenius over any field whose characteristic doesn't
divide that of the ring. As a consequence we obtain an easier proof of
Kov\'acs's theorem that the algebra of the monoid of matrices over a finite
field is a direct product of matrix algebras over group algebras of general
linear groups (outside of the characteristic of the finite field).

any sequence of performed operations can be undone by executing in reverse
order at any point during a computation. It has been attracting increasing
attention as it provides opportunities for low-power computation, being at the
same time essential or eligible in various applications. In recent work, we
have proposed a structural way of translating Reversing Petri Nets (RPNs) - a
type of Petri nets that embeds reversible computation, to bounded Coloured
Petri Nets (CPNs) - an extension of traditional Petri Nets, where tokens carry
data values. Three reversing semantics are possible in RPNs: backtracking
(reversing of the lately executed action), causal reversing (action can be
reversed only when all its effects have been undone) and out of causal
reversing (any previously performed action can be reversed). In this paper, we
extend the RPN to CPN translation with formal proofs of correctness. Moreover,
the possibility of introduction of cycles to RPNs is discussed. We analyze
which type of cycles could be allowed in RPNs to ensure consistency with the
current semantics. It emerged that the most interesting case related to cycles
in RPNs occurs in causal semantics, where various interpretations of dependency
result in different net's behaviour during reversing. Three definitions of
dependence are presented and discussed.

to improve the spatial multiplexing gains, and hence to maximize the average

programs is achieved via lexicographic ranking supermartingales (LexRSMs).
However, LexRSMs introduced in the previous work have a limitation that impedes
their automation: all of their components have to be non-negative in all
reachable states. This might result in LexRSM not existing even for simple
terminating programs. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a
generalization of LexRSMs which allows for some components to be negative. This
standard feature of non-probabilistic termination proofs was hitherto not known
to be sound in the probabilistic setting, as the soundness proof requires a
careful analysis of the underlying stochastic process. Second, we present
polynomial-time algorithms using our generalized LexRSMs for proving a.s.
termination in broad classes of linear-arithmetic programs.

challenging AI workload in recent times. State-of-the-art recommendation models
are one of the largest models matching the likes of GPT-3 and Switch
Transformer. Challenges in deep learning recommendation models (DLRM) stem from
learning dense embeddings for each of the categorical tokens. These embedding
tables in industrial scale models can be as large as hundreds of terabytes.
Such large models lead to a plethora of engineering challenges, not to mention
prohibitive communication overheads, and slower training and inference times.
Of these, slower inference time directly impacts user experience. Model
compression for DLRM is gaining traction and the community has recently shown
impressive compression results. In this paper, we present Random Offset Block
Embedding Array (ROBE) as a low memory alternative to embedding tables which
provide orders of magnitude reduction in memory usage while maintaining
accuracy and boosting execution speed. ROBE is a simple fundamental approach in
improving both cache performance and the variance of randomized hashing, which
could be of independent interest in itself. We demonstrate that we can
successfully train DLRM models with same accuracy while using $1000 \times$
less memory. A $1000\times$ compressed model directly results in faster
inference without any engineering effort. In particular, we show that we can
train DLRM model using ROBE array of size 100MB on a single GPU to achieve AUC
of 0.8025 or higher as required by official MLPerf CriteoTB benchmark DLRM
model of 100GB while achieving about $3.1\times$ (209\%) improvement in

flakes as flat structures into the Ni matrix, as it is common in available
studies, we introduce them into the heated liquid Ni and let the structures
equilibrate in a 14-ns molecular-dynamics run; these structures are then
quenched to obtain the composites. By varying the interaction of flake edge
atoms with the Ni matrix, two different flake morphologies -- wrinkled vs flat
-- are obtained. The mechanical properties, and in particular the composite
hardness, are investigated by a simulated nanoindentation test. The flake
morphology affects the plastic activity and the hardness of the composites.
Wrinkled flakes show a higher potential in absorbing dislocations than flat
flakes, resulting in a considerably reduced hardness of the composite. No
effect of the changed interaction between graphene edge atoms and the Ni matrix
on the dislocation activity and hardness could be observed. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that a high graphene content in the plastic zone leads to an
increased dislocation absorption and weakens the composite.

interacting binaries. The subsequent evolution of the CE, its ejection and the
formation of dust in its ejecta while the primary is on the Red Giant Branch
(RGB), gives rise to a recently identified evolutionary class -- dusty post-RGB
stars. Their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) suggest that their
mass-ejecta are similar to dusty post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) stars.
We have modeled the SEDs of a select sample of post-RGB and post-AGB stars in
the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), quantified the total dust mass (and gas mass
assuming gas-to-dust ratio) in the disks and shells and set constraints on the
dust grain compositions and sizes. We find that the shell masses in the
post-RGBs are generally less than those in post-AGBs, with the caveat that
substantial amount of mass in both types of objects may lie in cold, extended
shells. Our models suggest that circumstellar disks, when present, are
geometrically thick structures with a substantial opening angle, consistent
with numerical simulations of CE evolution (CEE). Comparison of our model dust
masses with the predictions of dust production during CEE on the RGB suggest
that CEE occurred near or at the tip of the RGB for our post-RGB sources. A
surprising result is that some post-RGB stars harbor carbon-rich dust, believed
to form when C/O $>$ 1, e.g. following triple-alpha nucleosynthesis and third
dredge-up events in AGB stars. This anomaly strengthens the hypothesis that
dusty post-RGBs are born in binary systems.

displaced vertices within the same collider event. As part of this analysis, we
also develop a procedure for reconstructing the masses and lifetimes of the

for testing planetary astrophysics. One such system is HD 191939 (TOI-1339), a
bright (V=9) and Sun-like (G9V) star, which TESS found to host three transiting
planets (b, c, and d). The planets have periods of 9, 29, and 38 days each with
similar sizes from 3 to 3.4 $R_{\oplus}$. To further characterize the system,
we measured the radial velocity (RV) of HD 191939 over 415 days with Keck/HIRES
and APF/Levy. We find that $M_b = 10.4 \pm 0.9 M_{\oplus}$ and $M_c = 7.2 \pm
1.4 M_{\oplus}$, which are low compared to most known planets of comparable
radii. The RVs yield only an upper-limit on $M_d$ (<5.8 $M_{\oplus}$ at
2$\sigma$). The RVs further reveal a fourth planet (e) with a minimum mass of
$0.34 \pm 0.01 M_{Jup}$ and an orbital period of 101.4 $\pm$ 0.4 days. Despite
its non-transiting geometry, secular interactions between planet e and the
inner transiting planets indicate that planet e is coplanar with the transiting
planets ($\Delta$i < 10$^{\circ}$). We identify a second high mass planet (f)
with 95% confidence intervals on mass between $2-11 \, M_{Jup}$ and period
between 1700-7200 days, based on a joint analysis of RVs and astrometry from
$Gaia$ and $Hipparcos$. As a bright star hosting multiple planets with
well-measured masses, HD 191939 presents many options for comparative planetary
astronomy including characterization with JWST.

the density matrix of the radiation deviates from the thermal state, small

energetically induces the $p$-wave pairing also to be quasi-periodic rather
than uniform pairing. More interestingly, when the normal metallic wire is
adjacent to the quasiperiodic superconducting wire, we have found that the
Majorana edge modes are being transferred to the edge of the normal metallic
side with enhanced stability. Finally, we discover the proximity effect on the
strengths of the quasi-periodicities with a general power-law relationship,
whose power depends on the tiling pattern. Our results show how quasi-periodic

from those in the vacuum. Its study continues to provide insights into quantum
materials, uncovering new design principles for their discovery. However,
unlike the Berry curvature, an intuitive understanding of the quantum metric is
lacking. Here, we show that the quantum metric of Bloch electrons leads to a
momentum-space gravity. In particular, by extending the semiclassical
formulation of electron dynamics to second order, we find that the resulting
velocity is modified by a geodesic term and becomes the momentum-space dual of
the Lorentz force in curved space. We calculate this geodesic response for
magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene and show that moir\'e systems with flat
bands are ideal candidates to observe this effect. Extending this analogy with
gravity further, we find that the momentum-space dual of the Einstein field
equations remains sourceless for pure states while for mixed states it acquires
a source term that depends on the von Neumann entropy, for small entropies. We
compare this stress-energy equation with the weak-field limit of general
relativity and conclude that the von Neumann entropy is the momentum-space dual
of the gravitational potential. Consequently, the momentum-space geodesic
equation for mixed states is modified by a term resembling an entropic force.
Our results highlight connections between quantum geometry, momentum-space
gravity and quantum information, prompting further exploration of this dual
gravity in quantum materials.

with the properties of a given stream being related to its progenitor. We
consider how the dynamical history of a progenitor cluster, as traced by the
evolution of its stellar mass function, is reflected in the resultant stream.
We generate model streams by evolving star clusters with a range of initial
half-mass relaxation times and dissolution times via direct N-body simulations.
Stellar streams that dissolve quickly show no variation in the stellar mass
function along the stream. Variation is, however, observed along streams with
progenitor clusters that dissolve after several relaxation times. The mass
function at the edges of a stream is approximately primordial as it is
populated by the first stars to escape the cluster before segregation occurs.
Moving inwards the mass function steepens as the intermediate parts of the
stream consist of mostly low-mass stars that escaped the cluster after some
segregation has occurred. The centre of the stream is then marked by a flatter
mass function, as the region is dominated by high-mass stars that quickly
segregated to the progenitor cluster's centre and were the last stars to become
unbound. We further find that the maximum slope of the mass function along the
stream and the rate at which it decreases with distance from the dissolved
progenitor serve as proxies for the dynamical state reached by the progenitor
cluster before dissolution; this may be able to be applied to observed streams
with near-future observations.

fit a quadratic model of four primary sources of variability, described by
labels of $T_{\rm eff}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H], and [$\alpha$/Fe], to the normalized
flux of 10,802 red-clump stars from the Gaia-RVS-like ARGOS survey. We examine
the residuals between ARGOS spectra and the models and find that the models
capture the flux variability across $85\%$ of the wavelength region. The
remaining residual variance is concentrated to the Ca-triplet features, at an
amplitude up to $12\%$ of the normalized flux. We use principal component
analysis on the residuals and find orthogonal correlations in the Ca-triplet
core and wings. This variability, not captured by our model, presumably marks
departures from the completeness of the 1D-LTE label description. To test the
indication of low-dimensionality, we turn to abundance-space to infer how well
we can predict measured [Si/H], [O/H], [Ca/H], [Ni/H], and [Al/H] abundances
from the Gaia-RVS-like RAVE survey with models of $T_{\rm eff}$, $\log g$,
[Fe/H], and [Mg/Fe]. We find that we can near-entirely predict these
abundances. Using high-precision APOGEE abundances, we determine that a
measurement uncertainty of $<$ 0.03 dex is required to capture additional

sufficiently describes chemical abundance variance for $\approx$ S/N $<$ 200

distribution of the base detector using the output of this GCN, the proposed

the evolution kinetics of an individual phase-grains relates to the growth rate

comfortably comprehensible statistical tools are employed to realise the
influence of the evolving phase-grains on the overall grain-growth kinetics of
multiphase systems, both duplex and triplex, with varying phase-fractions. A
dataset capable of rendering statistically significant, and accessible,
information is built by modelling, and analysing, grain growth in twenty
different polycrystalline systems, comprising of fourteen triplex and five
duplex microstructures with varying phase-fractions, and one homogeneous
single-phase system, in multiphase-field framework. Statistical analyses of
these wide-range of microstructures unravel that, during isotropic
grain-growth, the overall evolution kinetics of the duplex and triplex systems
are principally governed by the growth-rate of the major-phase grains,
irrespective of the phase-fractions. Furthermore, through multiple non-linear
regression, it is realised that with increase in the volume-fraction of the
major-phase grains, the overall isotropic grain-growth rate exhibited by duplex

relation. Additionally, the present investigation unravels that, while the

probabilistic error reduction can be used to estimate expectation values at

techniques avoid the need of specialized equipment and seamlessly integrate
with contemporary workflows. Further, it is expected that image-based
navigation will play a major role in enabling mixed reality environments and
autonomous, robotic workflows. A critical component of image guidance is 2D/3D
registration, a technique to estimate the spatial relationships between 3D
structures, e.g., volumetric imagery or tool models, and 2D images thereof,
such as fluoroscopy or endoscopy. While image-based 2D/3D registration is a
mature technique, its transition from the bench to the bedside has been
restrained by well-known challenges, including brittleness of the optimization
objective, hyperparameter selection, and initialization, difficulties around
inconsistencies or multiple objects, and limited single-view performance. One
reason these challenges persist today is that analytical solutions are likely
inadequate considering the complexity, variability, and high-dimensionality of
generic 2D/3D registration problems. The recent advent of machine
learning-based approaches to imaging problems that, rather than specifying the
desired functional mapping, approximate it using highly expressive parametric
models holds promise for solving some of the notorious challenges in 2D/3D
registration. In this manuscript, we review the impact of machine learning on
2D/3D registration to systematically summarize the recent advances made by
introduction of this novel technology. Grounded in these insights, we then

It further improves the convenient representation of this large family of exact
black holes found in 2005 by Griffiths and Podolsky. The main advantage of the
new metric is that the key functions are considerably simplified, fully
explicit, and factorized. All four horizons are thus clearly identified, and
degenerate cases with extreme horizons can easily be discussed. Moreover, the
new metric depends only on six parameters with direct geometrical and physical
meaning, namely m, a, l, alpha, e, g which characterize mass, Kerr-like
rotation, NUT parameter, acceleration, electric and magnetic charges of the
black hole, respectively. This general metric reduces directly to the familiar
forms of either (possibly accelerating) Kerr-Newman, charged Taub-NUT solution,
or (possibly rotating and charged) C-metric by simply setting the corresponding
parameters to zero, without the need of any further transformations. In
addition, it shows that the Plebanski-Demianski family does not involve
accelerating black holes with just the NUT parameter, which were discovered by
Chng, Mann and Stelea in 2006. It also enables us to investigate various
physical properties, such as the character of singularities, horizons,
ergoregions, global conformal structure including the Penrose diagrams, cosmic
strings causing the acceleration of the black holes, their rotation,
pathological regions with closed timelike curves, or explicit thermodynamic
properties. It thus seems that our new metric is a useful representation of
this important family of black hole spacetimes of algebraic type D in the
asymptotically flat settings.

black holes. We assume that the matter field is conformal and that the metric
satisfies the semi-classical Einstein equation $G_{\mu\nu}=8\pi G \langle \psi|
T_{\mu\nu}|\psi \rangle$, where $|\psi \rangle$ is the wave function of the
matter field. Then as a necessary condition, its trace part must be satisfied,
$G^\mu{}_\mu=8\pi G \langle \psi| T^\mu{}_\mu|\psi \rangle$, whose right-hand
side is independent of $|\psi \rangle$ and is determined only by the metric
through the 4-dimensional Weyl anomaly. With some physically reasonable
assumptions, this equation restricts the interior metric to a certain class.
Such metrics are approximately warped products of $AdS_2$ and $S^2$ with almost
Planckian curvature. Among them, we find one that is consistent with Hawking
radiation and is smoothly connected to the exterior Schwarzschild metric
slightly outside the Schwarzschild radius. This leads to a picture that the
black hole is a dense object with a surface (not a horizon), which evaporates
due to Hawking-like radiation when taken out of the bath. Other solutions

Covid-19 warning apps a priori, before an action is performed. Today the common
warning apps estimate risk a posteriori and give no advice on particular
scenarios. The new model also has the advantage that the individual risks
behind the decision-making process would be uniform (in contrast to some
current regulations) and it could help to understand the risks better and could
also help to reduce risks a priori. It could be easily implemented on a single
app screen, needing only some individual preferences to be set and a handful of
adjustments to the particular scenario that shall be assessed. The disadvantage
as of any simplified semi-quantitative risk models is that calibration is not
easy (as some calibration points may even contradict) and that cumulative
effects are hard to integrate e. g. the joint effect of combined scenarios.
But, in principle calibration is feasible and it may be a good decision to
calibrate the model conservatively.

  matter","100 pages, 61 figures, master thesis",,,,"hep-ph hep-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The mass of ultralight axions is determined in order to get the explicit
U(1)$_A$ symmetry breaking scale $ \Lambda $ at a Peccei-Quinn scale of the
magnitude of the Planck mass. It is assumed that the dominant contribution to
the mass of a galaxy with low surface brightness is only determined by one
axionic species in the sense of fuzzy dark matter (lumps). For rotation curve
fits to galactic rotation curves, therefore the Soliton-Navarro-Frenk-White
model is used, which assumes a condensate core plus correlated axions in the
halo according to the solution of the Poisson-Schr\""odinger system. In
addition, three commonly used mass density profiles are considered:
Navarro-Frenk-White, pseudo-isothermal and the Burkert model. An axion mass
$m_a$ of $0.675\times10^{-23}\,$eV is extracted, which reproduces previous
results in the literature. This implies an effective Yang-Mills scale of
$\Lambda \sim 287\,$ eV, which is only a factor of $15$ smaller than the
Yang-Mills scale of an SU(2) theory that is used to describe the first lepton
family. The cosmological model SU(2)$_{\rm CMB} $ suggests that three SU(2)
Yang-Mills theories, each for the formation of the lepton doublets (e,$\nu_e$),
($\mu$,$\nu_\mu$), and ($\tau$,$\nu_\tau$) are equally responsible for
contributing to the current density of dark matter. Parameters of an isolated
lump, such as the gravitational Bohr radius or the virial mass, are determined
solely by the Planck mass and the corresponding lepton mass. If the dominant
constituent of the dark mass contained in a galaxy is represented by e-lumps, a
mixture of $ \tau- $ and $ \mu$-lumps could possibly explain the presence of
massive compact objects in galactic centers, and $ \tau$-lumps could be related
to globular clusters and the halo mass. This might provide a theoretical
explanation for the mass gap between stellar and super massive black holes.

performed within the CDFT framework for the first time. Theoretical results
obtained with conventional covariant energy density functionals and separable
pairing interaction are compared with experimental differential charge radii in
the regions of the nuclear chart in which available experimental data crosses
neutron shell closures at N = 28, 50, 82 and 126. The analysis of absolute
differential radii of different isotopic chains and their relative properties
indicate clearly that such properties are reasonably well described in model
calculations in the cases when the mean-field approximation is justified.
However, while the observed clusterization of differential charge radii of
different isotopic chains is well described above the N=50 and N=126 shell
closures, it is more difficult to reproduce it above the N=28 and N=82 shell
closures because of possible deficiencies in underlying single-particle
structure. The impact of the latter has been evaluated for spherical shapes and
it was shown that the relative energies of the single-particle states and the
patterns of their occupation with increasing neutron number have an appreciable
impact on the evolution of the differential charge radii. It is shown that the
kinks in the charge radii at neutron shell closures are due to the underlying
single-particle structure and due to weakening or collapse of pairing at these
closures. It is usually assumed that pairing is a dominant contributor to
odd-even staggering (OES) in charge radii. Our analysis paints a more
complicated picture. It suggests a new mechanism in which the fragmentation of
the single-particle content of the ground state in odd-mass nuclei due to
particle-vibration coupling provides a significant contribution to OES in
charge radii.

material rebound and friction challenging. We show that the use of APIC,

states, one of which is entangled and the other product, in any bipartite
quantum system, one always obtains an entangled state, provided the entangled
state of the pair appears with a nonzero probability. On the other hand, if we
consider any superposition of the same pair, with a nonzero amplitude for the
entangled state of the pair, the output state may not always be entangled.
Motivated by this fact, in this work, we study the superpositions of a pure
entangled state and a pure product state, when the amplitudes corresponding to
the states appearing in any superposition are nonzero. We show, in particular,
that all such superpositions produce only entangled states if the initial
entangled state has Schmidt rank three or higher. Again, superposing a pure
entangled state and a product state cannot lead to product states only, in any
bipartite quantum system. These lead us to define conditional and unconditional
inseparabilities of superpositions. These concepts in turn are useful in
quantum communication protocols. We find that conditional inseparability of
superpositions help in identifying strategies for conclusive local
discrimination of shared quantum ensembles. We also find that the unconditional
variety leads to systematic methods for spotting ensembles exhibiting the
phenomenon of more nonlocality with less entanglement and two-element ensembles

transient XUV measurements is complicated by changes in core-valence exciton
and angular momentum effects after photoexcitation. Here, we report the
photoexcited electron and hole dynamics for ZnTe, a promising material for CO2
reduction, following 400 nm excitation. We apply a newly developed, ab-initio
theoretical approach based on density functional theory and the Bethe-Salpeter
equation to accurately predict the excited state change in the measured
transient XUV spectra. Electrons excited to the conduction band are measured
with a thermalization rate of 70 $\pm$ 40 fs. Holes are excited with an average
excess energy of ~1 eV and thermalize in 1130 $\pm$ 150 fs. The theoretical
approach also allows an estimated assignment of inter- and intra-valley
relaxation pathways in k-space using the relative amplitudes of the
core-valence excitons.

spectrum at redshifts 7.9 and 10.4 with 18 nights of data ($\sim36$ hours of
integration) from Phase I of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA).
The Phase I data show evidence for systematics that can be largely suppressed
with systematic models down to a dynamic range of $\sim10^9$ with respect to
the peak foreground power. This yields a 95% confidence upper limit on the 21
cm power spectrum of $\Delta^2_{21} \le (30.76)^2\ {\rm mK}^2$ at $k=0.192\ h\
{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at $z=7.9$, and also $\Delta^2_{21} \le (95.74)^2\ {\rm mK}^2$
at $k=0.256\ h\ {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ at $z=10.4$. At $z=7.9$, these limits are the
most sensitive to-date by over an order of magnitude. While we find evidence
for residual systematics at low line-of-sight Fourier $k_\parallel$ modes, at
high $k_\parallel$ modes we find our data to be largely consistent with thermal
noise, an indicator that the system could benefit from deeper integrations. The
observed systematics could be due to radio frequency interference, cable
sub-reflections, or residual instrumental cross-coupling, and warrant further
study. This analysis emphasizes algorithms that have minimal inherent signal
loss, although we do perform a careful accounting in a companion paper of the
small forms of loss or bias associated with the pipeline. Overall, these
results are a promising first step in the development of a tuned,
instrument-specific analysis pipeline for HERA, particularly as Phase II

topological photonic crystal fibers based on second order photonic corner modes
from the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Different from previous works where the
in-plane properties at $k_z=0$ have been mainly studied, we find that in the
fiber configuration of $k_z>0$, a topological bandgap only exists when the
propagation constant $k_z$ along the fiber axis is larger than a certain
threshold and the emergent topological bandgap at large $k_z$ hosts two sets of
corner fiber modes. We further investigate the propagation diagrams, propose a
convenient way to tune the frequencies of the corner fiber modes within the
topological bandgap and envisage multi-frequency and multi-channel transmission
capabilities of this new type of fibers. Our work will not only have practical
importance, but could also open a new area for fiber exploration where many
existing higher-order topological photonic modes could bring exciting new
opportunities for fiber designs and applications.

terms of predicting, clustering and classifying complex flow physics. One
application has been the classification or clustering of various wake
structures that emanate from bluff bodies such as cylinders or flapping foils,
creating a rich diversity of vortex formations specific to flow conditions,
geometry, and/or kinematics of the body. When utilizing oscillating foils to
harvest energy from tidal or river flows, it is critical to understand the
intricate and nonlinear relationship between flapping kinematics and the
downstream vortex wake structure for optimal siting and operation of arrays.
This paper develops a classification model to obtain groups of kinematics that
contain similar wake patterns within the energy harvesting regime. Data is
obtained through simulations of 27 unique oscillating foil kinematics for a
total of 13,650 samples of the wake vorticity field. Within these samples three
groups are visually labeled based on the relative angle of attack. A machine
learning approach combining a convolutional neural network (CNN) with long
short-term memory (LSTM) units is utilized to automatically classify the wakes
into the three groups. The average accuracy on five test data subsets is 80%
when the three visually labeled groups are used for classification. After
analyzing the test subset with lowest accuracy, an update on the group division
boundaries is proposed. With this update, the algorithm achieves an average
accuracy of 90%, demonstrating that the three groups are able to discern
distinct wake structures within a range of energy harvesting kinematics.

these simulator packages have been mainly designed for omni-directional

to strategically inject different prosodic information in all parts of the
architecture. The model explicitly encodes traditional low-level prosody
features such as pitch, loudness and duration, but also higher level prosodic
information that helps generating convincing voices in highly expressive
styles. Speaker identity and prosodic information are disentangled through an
adversarial training strategy that enables accurate prosody transfer across
speakers. Experimental results show that Daft-Exprt significantly outperforms
strong baselines on inter-text cross-speaker prosody transfer tasks, while
yielding naturalness comparable to state-of-the-art expressive models.
Moreover, results indicate that the model discards speaker identity information
from the prosody representation, and consistently generate speech with the
desired voice. We publicly release our code and provide speech samples from our

latent states from multiple sensory inputs using observation models that
capture the joint distribution between latent states and observations. This
inference problem can be formulated as an objective over a graph that optimizes
for the most likely sequence of states using all previous measurements. Prior
work uses observation models that are either known a-priori or trained on
surrogate losses independent of the graph optimizer. In this paper, we propose
a method to directly optimize end-to-end tracking performance by learning
observation models with the graph optimizer in the loop. This direct approach
may appear, however, to require the inference algorithm to be fully
differentiable, which many state-of-the-art graph optimizers are not. Our key
insight is to instead formulate the problem as that of energy-based learning.
We propose a novel approach, LEO, for learning observation models end-to-end
with graph optimizers that may be non-differentiable. LEO alternates between
sampling trajectories from the graph posterior and updating the model to match
these samples to ground truth trajectories. We propose a way to generate such
samples efficiently using incremental Gauss-Newton solvers. We compare LEO
against baselines on datasets drawn from two distinct tasks: navigation and
real-world planar pushing. We show that LEO is able to learn complex

of fields, as well as an explicit construction of the kinematic algebra and
associated kinematic current. As a byproduct, we also derive new formulations
of the special Galileon (SG) and Born-Infeld (BI) theory.
  For Yang-Mills (YM) theory, this same approach reveals a novel structure --
covariant color-kinematics duality -- whose only difference from the
conventional duality is that $1/\Box$ is replaced with covariant $1/D^2$.
Remarkably, this structure implies that YM theory is itself the covariant
double copy of gauged biadjoint scalar (GBAS) theory and an $F^3$ theory of
field strengths encoding a corresponding kinematic algebra and current.
Directly applying the double copy to equations of motion, we derive general
relativity (GR) from the product of Einstein-YM and $F^3$ theory. This exercise
reveals a trivial variant of the classical double copy that recasts any
solution of GR as a solution of YM theory in a curved background.
  Covariant color-kinematics duality also implies a new decomposition of
tree-level amplitudes in YM theory into those of GBAS theory. Using this
representation we derive a closed-form, analytic expression for all BCJ
numerators in YM theory and the NLSM for any number of particles in any
spacetime dimension. By virtue of the double copy, this constitutes an explicit
formula for all tree-level scattering amplitudes in YM, GR, NLSM, SG, and BI.

structures it may host, and therefore symmetry is the guiding principle to find
topological materials. Here we introduce an alternative guiding principle,
which we call 'quasi-symmetry'. This is the situation where a Hamiltonian has
an exact symmetry at lower-order that is broken by higher-order perturbation
terms. This enforces finite but parametrically small gaps at some low-symmetry
points in momentum space. Untethered from the restraints of symmetry,
quasi-symmetries eliminate the need for fine-tuning as they enforce that
sources of large Berry curvature will occur at arbitrary chemical potentials.
We demonstrate that a quasi-symmetry in the semi-metal CoSi stabilizes gaps
below 2 meV over a large near-degenerate plane that can be measured in the
quantum oscillation spectrum. The application of in-plane strain breaks the
crystal symmetry and gaps the degenerate point, observable by new magnetic
breakdown orbits. The quasi-symmetry, however, does not depend on spatial
symmetries and hence transmission remains fully coherent. These results
demonstrate a class of topological materials with increased resilience to
perturbations such as strain-induced crystalline symmetry breaking, which may
lead to robust topological applications as well as unexpected topology beyond
the usual space group classifications.

models have received much attention from engineering fields. Since it was
proposed, Bayesian optimization has quickly become a popular and promising
approach for solving global optimization problems. However, the standard
Bayesian optimization algorithm is insufficient to solving the global optimal
solution when the model is high-dimensional. Hence, this paper presents a novel
high dimensional Bayesian optimization algorithm by considering dimension
reduction and different dimension fill-in strategies. Most existing literature
about Bayesian optimization algorithms did not discuss the sampling strategies
to optimize the acquisition function. This study proposed a new sampling method
based on both the multi-armed bandit and random search methods while optimizing
the acquisition function. Besides, based on the time-dependent or
dimension-dependent characteristics of the model, the proposed algorithm can
reduce the dimension evenly. Then, five different dimension fill-in strategies
were discussed and compared in this study. Finally, to increase the final
accuracy of the optimal solution, the proposed algorithm adds a local search
based on a series of Adam-based steps at the final stage. Our computational
experiments demonstrated that the proposed Bayesian optimization algorithm
could achieve reasonable solutions with excellent performances for high
dimensional global optimization problems with a time-series optimal control
model.

not every cluster has a Disperse node match (and sometimes $>1$ cluster matches
to the same Disperse node). The clusters frequently lacking a matching Disperse
node have a different distribution of local shear trends and perhaps merger
histories. It might be interesting to see in what other ways, e.g.,
observational properties, these clusters differ. For the webs with smoothing
$\leq$ 2.5 $Mpc/h$, and all but the most restrictive matching criterion,
$\sim$3/4 of the clusters always have a Disperse node counterpart. The nearest
cluster to a given Disperse node and vice versa, within twice the smoothing
length, obey a cluster mass-Disperse node density relation. Cluster pairs where
both clusters match Disperse nodes can also be assigned the filaments between
those nodes, but as the web and matching methods are varied, most such
filaments do not remain. There is an enhancement of subhalo counts and halo
mass between cluster pairs, averaging over cluster pairs assigned Disperse
filaments increases the enhancement. The approach here also lends itself to
comparing nodes across many cosmic web constructions, using the fixed

""Spartus"" that exploits spatio-temporal sparsity to achieve ultra-low latency

matrices for a balanced workload. The pruned networks running on Spartus
hardware achieve weight sparsity levels of up to 96% and 94% with negligible
accuracy loss on the TIMIT and the Librispeech datasets. To induce temporal
sparsity in LSTM, we extend the previous DeltaGRU method to the DeltaLSTM
method. Combining spatio-temporal sparsity with CBTD and DeltaLSTM saves on
weight memory access and associated arithmetic operations. The Spartus
architecture is scalable and supports real-time online speech recognition when
implemented on small and large FPGAs. Spartus per-sample latency for a single
DeltaLSTM layer of 1024 neurons averages 1 us. Exploiting spatio-temporal
sparsity on our test LSTM network using the TIMIT dataset leads to 46X speedup

assembly) is challenging. This paper considers two major problems: how to learn
a diversified policy (instead of just one average policy) that can efficiently
handle different workpieces with minimum amount of training data, and how to
handle defects of workpieces during insertion. To address the problems, we
propose tolerance-guided policy learning. To encourage transferability of the
learned policy to different workpieces, we add a task embedding to the policy's
input space using the insertion tolerance. Then we train the policy using
generative adversarial imitation learning with reward shaping (RS-GAIL) on a
variety of representative situations. To encourage adaptability of the learned
policy to handle defects, we build a probabilistic inference model that can
output the best inserting pose based on failed insertions using the tolerance
model. The best inserting pose is then used as a reference to the learned
policy. This proposed method is validated on a sequence of IC socket insertion
tasks in simulation. The results show that 1) RS-GAIL can efficiently learn
optimal policies under sparse rewards; 2) the tolerance embedding can enhance
the transferability of the learned policy; 3) the probabilistic inference makes
the policy robust to defects on the workpieces.

with the photon as allowed by their quantum numbers and continually engaging in
breakup and recombination as required by the Faddeev kernel. The presence of
such correlations owes largely to the mechanisms responsible for the emergence
of hadron mass; and whereas the nucleon Faddeev amplitude is dominated by
scalar and axial-vector diquark correlations, the amplitude of its parity

important component of these systems that is not included in current theory or

modeling and optimal control framework should consider the attrition of agents

agents defending a high-value unit from an attacking swarm. We show that these

attrition and spatial dynamics are coupled. Our results have relevance to an
entire class of adversarial autonomy situations, where the positions of agents

interventions designed to address vaccine hesitancy. This paper is addressing
the first step in tackling hesitancy against COVID-19 vaccines, namely the
automatic detection of known misinformation about the vaccines on Twitter, the
social media platform that has the highest volume of conversations about
COVID-19 and its vaccines. We present CoVaxLies, a new dataset of tweets judged
relevant to several misinformation targets about COVID-19 vaccines on which a
novel method of detecting misinformation was developed. Our method organizes
CoVaxLies in a Misinformation Knowledge Graph as it casts misinformation
detection as a graph link prediction problem. The misinformation detection
method detailed in this paper takes advantage of the link scoring functions
provided by several knowledge embedding methods. The experimental results

humanity has ever seen. However, despite the mechanisms for zombie uprisings in
pop culture, it is unknown whether zombies, from an evolutionary point of view,
can actually rise from the dead. To provide insight into this unknown, we
created a mathematical model that predicts the trajectory of human and zombie
populations during a zombie apocalypse. We parameterized our model according to
the demographics of the US, the zombie literature, and then conducted an
evolutionary invasion analysis to determine conditions that permit the
evolution of zombies. Our results indicate a zombie invasion is theoretically
possible, provided there is a sufficiently large ratio of transmission rate to
the zombie death rate. While achieving this ratio is uncommon in nature, the
existence of zombie ant fungus illustrates it is possible and thereby suggests
that a zombie apocalypse among humans could occur.

detected eight glitches in five pulsars. Among them is PSR J1939+2609, an
apparently old pulsar (characteristic age $\sim$1 Gy), and PSR J1954+2529,
which likely belongs to a newly-emerging class of binary pulsars. The latter is
the only pulsar among the 72 that is clearly not isolated: a non-recycled
neutron star with a 931-ms spin period in an eccentric ($e\,=\,0.114$) wide
($P_b\,=\,82.7\,$d) orbit with a companion of undetermined nature having a
minimum mass of $\sim0.6\,M_{\odot}$. Since operations at Arecibo ceased in
2020 August, we give a final tally of PALFA sky coverage, and compare its 207
pulsar discoveries to the known population. On average, they are 50% more
distant than other Galactic plane radio pulsars; PALFA millisecond pulsars
(MSP) have twice the dispersion measure per unit spin period than the known
population of MSP in the Plane. The four intermittent pulsars discovered by
PALFA more than double the population of such objects, which should help to
improve our understanding of pulsar magnetosphere physics. The statistics for
these, RRATS, and nulling pulsars suggest that there are many more of these
objects in the Galaxy than was previously thought.

lives and mobility behavior. The demand for on-demand ride services, such as
taxis and ridehailing has been specifically impacted, given both restrictions
in service operations and user's concerns about virus transmission in shared
vehicles. During the pandemic, demand for these modes have decreased by as much
as 80%. This study examines intentions to use on-demand ride services in a
period of drastic changes in lifestyles and daily routines coupled with
unprecedented mobility reductions. Specifically, we examine the determinants
for the shift of intentions to use these on-demand modes of travel in the early
stages of the pandemic. Using data from a survey disseminated in June 2020 to
700 respondents from contiguous United States, ordinal regression modeling is
applied to analyze the shift in consideration. The results indicate that
political orientation and health-related experiences during the pandemic are
significant sources of variation for individual changes in intentions to use
ridehailing. Additionally, characteristics such as age and income result in
consideration shifts that contradict the typical ridership profiles found in
the ridehailing literature. Specifically, on-demand ride consideration
decreases as a function of age and income. Moreover, transit-users are more
willing to consider on-demand rides than private vehicle users, suggesting that
shared vehicle modes have a similar risk-profile. We discuss the role of
on-demand ride services in the pandemic era, and the need to investigate
political orientation and evolving pandemic experiences to pinpoint their role
in future mobility systems.

examine this question through a qualitative lens by interviewing journalists

scenario to demonstrate transparency features using two fundamental news
attributes that convey the trustworthiness of a news article: source and
message. In the interviews, our news consumers expressed the idea that news
transparency could be best shown by providing indicators of objectivity in two
areas (news selection and framing) and by providing indicators of evidence in
four areas (presence of source materials, anonymous sourcing, verification, and
corrections upon erroneous reporting). While our journalists agreed with news
consumers' suggestions of using evidence indicators, they also suggested
additional transparency indicators in areas such as the news reporting process
and personal/organizational conflicts of interest. Prompted by our scenario,
participants offered new design considerations for building trustworthy news
platforms, such as designing for easy comprehension, presenting appropriate
details in news articles (e.g., showing the number and nature of corrections
made to an article), and comparing attributes across news organizations to
highlight diverging practices. Comparing the responses from our two stakeholder
groups reveals conflicting suggestions with trade-offs between them. Our study
has implications for HCI designers in building trustworthy news systems.

quantification, which addresses three major issues with the state-of-the-art PI
methods. First, existing PI methods require retraining of neural networks (NNs)
for every given confidence level and suffer from the crossing issue in
calculating multiple PIs. Second, they usually rely on customized loss
functions with extra sensitive hyperparameters for which fine tuning is
required to achieve a well-calibrated PI. Third, they usually underestimate
uncertainties of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples leading to over-confident
PIs. Our PI3NN method calculates PIs from linear combinations of three NNs,
each of which is independently trained using the standard mean squared error
loss. The coefficients of the linear combinations are computed using
root-finding algorithms to ensure tight PIs for a given confidence level. We
theoretically prove that PI3NN can calculate PIs for a series of confidence
levels without retraining NNs and it completely avoids the crossing issue.
Additionally, PI3NN does not introduce any unusual hyperparameters resulting in
a stable performance. Furthermore, we address OOD identification challenge by
introducing an initialization scheme which provides reasonably larger PIs of
the OOD samples than those of the in-distribution samples. Benchmark and
real-world experiments show that our method outperforms several
state-of-the-art approaches with respect to predictive uncertainty quality,
robustness, and OOD samples identification.

the Internet of Things (IoT) devices to support various types of real-time IoT
applications. However, due to the mobility of users and a wide range of IoT
applications with different requirements, it is a challenging issue to satisfy
these applications' requirements. The execution of IoT applications exclusively
on one fog/edge server may not be always feasible due to limited resources,
while execution of IoT applications on different servers needs further
collaboration among servers. Also, considering user mobility, some modules of
each IoT application may require migration to other servers for execution,
leading to service interruption and extra execution costs. In this article, we
propose a new weighted cost model for hierarchical fog computing environments,
in terms of the response time of IoT applications and energy consumption of IoT
devices, to minimize the cost of running IoT applications and potential
migrations. Besides, a distributed clustering technique is proposed to enable
the collaborative execution of tasks, emitted from application modules, among
servers. Also, we propose an application placement technique to minimize the
overall cost of executing IoT applications on multiple servers in a distributed
manner. Furthermore, a distributed migration management technique is proposed
for the potential migration of applications' modules to other remote servers as
the users move along their path. Besides, failure recovery methods are embedded
in the clustering, application placement, and migration management techniques
to recover from unpredicted failures. The performance results show that our
technique significantly improves its counterparts in terms of placement
deployment time, average execution cost of tasks, total number of migrations,
total number of interrupted tasks, and cumulative migration cost.

variations related to their cognitive abilities? This study bridges
domain-specific perspectives on visualization design with those provided by
cognition and perception. We measure variations in visualization task
performance across chemistry, computer science, and education, and relate these
differences to variations in spatial ability. We conducted an online study with
over 60 domain experts consisting of tasks related to pie charts, isocontour
plots, and 3D scatterplots, and grounded by a well-documented spatial ability
test. Task performance (correctness) varied with profession across more complex
visualizations, but not pie charts, a comparatively common visualization. We
found that correctness correlates with spatial ability, and the professions
differ in terms of spatial ability. These results indicate that domains differ
not only in the specifics of their data and tasks, but also in terms of how
effectively their constituent members engage with visualizations and their
cognitive traits. Analyzing participants' confidence and strategy comments
suggests that focusing on performance neglects important nuances, such as
differing approaches to engage with even common visualizations and potential
skill transference. Our findings offer a fresh perspective on

interpretation is in agreement with the correlation between the observed

energy distribution (SED) fitting and obtaining the star-formation histories of
the sample, we observe a small decrease in SFR between 100 and 10 Myr in
galaxies when the outflow H$\alpha$ luminosity contribution is increased,
indicating that the feedback somewhat inhibits the star formation within these
timescales. The observed emission-line ratios are best reproduced by
photoionization models when compared to shock-ionization, indicating that
radiation from young stellar population is dominant, and seems to be a
consequence of a continuous star-formation activity instead of a bursty event.

Particularly, for the 3D higher-order topological insulators, it can host hinge

(CE$\nu$NS) provides us opportunities to explore a wide class of new physics.
In the Standard Model (SM), the CE$\nu$NS process arises from the vector and
axial-vector neutral currents through the exchange of $Z$ boson and the
axial-vector current contribution turns out to be subdominant. It is thus
natural to consider the extra contributions to CE$\nu$NS from more generic new
physics beyond the SM with (axial-)vector interactions associated with a new
vector mediator $Z'$. Besides the ordinary CE$\nu$NS, the active neutrinos can
convert into a new exotic fermion $\chi$ through the process $\nu N\to \chi N$
mediated by $Z'$ without violating the coherence. It would be interesting to
consider the implication of this conversion for the new fermion sector beyond
the SM. We consider the framework of a simplified neutrino model in which a new
Dirac fermion $\chi$ interacts with active neutrinos and a leptophobic vector
mediator $Z'$. We evaluate both the tree-level and loop-level contributions to
the CE$\nu$NS and in particular the loop diagrams produce active neutrino
elastic scattering process $\nu N\to \nu N$ with the fermion $\chi$ inside the
loops. When the interaction between $Z'$ and the SM quarks is vector type and
axial-vector type, the CE$\nu$NS processes are respectively dominated by the
tree-level and loop-level contributions. We investigate the constraints on the
model parameters by fitting to the COHERENT data, assuming a wide range of
$m_\chi$. The parameter space with $m_\chi$ larger than the maximal energy of
incoming neutrinos can be constrained by including the loop-level contribution.
More importantly, the inclusion of loop diagrams can place constraint on
axial-vector interaction whose tree-level process is absent in the coherent
neutrino-nucleus scattering.

been the most important technology for increasing the business at Fliggy, one
of the most popular online travel platforms (OTPs) in China. There are three
major challenges facing OTPs: sparsity, diversity, and implicitness. In this
paper, we present a novel Fliggy ITinerary-aware deep matching NETwork (FitNET)
to address these three challenges. FitNET is designed based on the popular deep
matching network, which has been successfully employed in many industrial
recommendation systems, due to its effectiveness. The concept itinerary is
firstly proposed under the context of recommendation systems for OTPs, which is
defined as the list of unconsumed orders of a user. All orders in a user
itinerary are learned as a whole, based on which the implicit travel intention
of each user can be more accurately inferred. To alleviate the sparsity
problem, users' profiles are incorporated into FitNET. Meanwhile, a series of
itinerary-aware attention mechanisms that capture the vital interactions
between user's itinerary and other input categories are carefully designed.
These mechanisms are very helpful in inferring a user's travel intention or
preference, and handling the diversity in a user's need. Further, two training
objectives, i.e., prediction accuracy of user's travel intention and prediction
accuracy of user's click behavior, are utilized by FitNET, so that these two
objectives can be optimized simultaneously. An offline experiment on Fliggy
production dataset with over 0.27 million users and 1.55 million travel items,
and an online A/B test both show that FitNET effectively learns users' travel
intentions, preferences, and diverse needs, based on their itineraries and
gains superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. FitNET now
has been successfully deployed at Fliggy, serving major online traffic.

to predict user' preference. However, it is difficult to recommend items to new
users accurately. To alleviate this problem, existing user cold start methods
either apply deep learning to build a cross-domain recommender system or map
user attributes into the space of user behaviour. These methods are more
challenging when applied to online travel platform (e.g., Fliggy), because it
is hard to find a cross-domain that user has similar behaviour with travel
scenarios and the Location Based Services (LBS) information of users have not
been paid sufficient attention. In this work, we propose a LBS-based
Heterogeneous Relations Model (LHRM) for user cold start recommendation, which
utilizes user's LBS information and behaviour information in related domains
and user's behaviour information in travel platforms (e.g., Fliggy) to
construct the heterogeneous relations between users and items. Moreover, an
attention-based multi-layer perceptron is applied to extract latent factors of
users and items. Through this way, LHRM has better generalization performance
than existing methods. Experimental results on real data from Fliggy's offline
log illustrate the effectiveness of LHRM.

system model consists of one base station (BS) and one RIS that is deployed to
enhance the performance of both eMBB and URLLC in terms of the achievable data
rate and reliability, respectively. We formulate two optimization problems, a
time slot basis eMBB allocation problem and a mini-time slot basis URLLC
allocation problem. The eMBB allocation problem aims at maximizing the eMBB sum
rate by jointly optimizing the power allocation at the BS and the RIS
phase-shift matrix while satisfying the eMBB rate constraint. On the other
hand, the URLLC allocation problem is formulated as a multi-objective problem
with the goal of maximizing the URLLC admitted packets and minimizing the eMBB
rate loss. This is achieved by jointly optimizing the power and frequency
allocations along with the RIS phase-shift matrix. In order to avoid the
violation in the URLLC latency requirements, we propose a novel framework in
which the RIS phase-shift matrix that enhances the URLLC reliability is
proactively designed at the beginning of the time slot. For the sake of solving
the URLLC allocation problem, two algorithms are proposed, namely, an
optimization-based URLLC allocation algorithm and a heuristic algorithm. The
simulation results show that the heuristic algorithm has a low time complexity,
which makes it practical for real-time and efficient multiplexing between eMBB
and URLLC traffic. In addition, using only 60 RIS elements, we observe that the
proposed scheme achieves around 99.99\% URLLC packets admission rate compared
to 95.6\% when there is no RIS, while also achieving up to 70\% enhancement on

capture either local syntactic information or global relational information,
thus missing either one of them leads to insufficient syntactic information. To

includes three key components: (1) a knowledge-aware gated recurrent memory

dual syntax graph network combines both kinds of syntactic information to
comprehensively capture sufficient syntactic information; (3) a knowledge
integrating gate re-enhances the final representation with further needed

event detection (VAD), existing solutions typically suffer from two issues: (1)
The localization of video events cannot be both precious and comprehensive. (2)
The semantics and temporal context are under-explored. To tackle those issues,
we are motivated by the prevalent cloze test in education and propose a novel
approach named Visual Cloze Completion (VCC), which conducts VAD by learning to
complete ""visual cloze tests"" (VCTs). Specifically, VCC first localizes each
video event and encloses it into a spatio-temporal cube (STC). To achieve both
precise and comprehensive localization, appearance and motion are used as
complementary cues to mark the object region associated with each event. For
each marked region, a normalized patch sequence is extracted from current and
adjacent frames and stacked into a STC. With each patch and the patch sequence
of a STC compared to a visual ""word"" and ""sentence"" respectively, we
deliberately erase a certain ""word"" (patch) to yield a VCT. Then, the VCT is
completed by training DNNs to infer the erased patch and its optical flow via
video semantics. Meanwhile, VCC fully exploits temporal context by
alternatively erasing each patch in temporal context and creating multiple
VCTs. Furthermore, we propose localization-level, event-level, model-level and
decision-level solutions to enhance VCC, which can further exploit VCC's
potential and produce significant performance improvement gain. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that VCC achieves state-of-the-art VAD performance. Our
codes and results are open at https://github.com/yuguangnudt/VEC_VAD/tree/VCC.

Different from image captioning that describes a static image with details of
almost every object, video captioning usually considers a sequence of frames
and biases towards focused objects, e.g., the objects that stay in focus
regardless of the changing background. Therefore, detecting and properly
accommodating focused objects is critical in video captioning. To enforce the
description of focused objects and achieve controllable video captioning, we
propose an Object-Oriented Non-Autoregressive approach (O2NA), which performs
caption generation in three steps: 1) identify the focused objects and predict
their locations in the target caption; 2) generate the related attribute words
and relation words of these focused objects to form a draft caption; and 3)
combine video information to refine the draft caption to a fluent final
caption. Since the focused objects are generated and located ahead of other
words, it is difficult to apply the word-by-word autoregressive generation
process; instead, we adopt a non-autoregressive approach. The experiments on
two benchmark datasets, i.e., MSR-VTT and MSVD, demonstrate the effectiveness
of O2NA, which achieves results competitive with the state-of-the-arts but with
both higher diversity and higher inference speed.

``stolen'' by surrogate model attack. There has been significant progress in
solutions to protect the IP of DNN models in classification tasks. However,
little attention has been devoted to the protection of DNNs in image processing
tasks. By utilizing consistent invisible spatial watermarks, one recent work
first considered model watermarking for deep image processing networks and
demonstrated its efficacy in many downstream tasks. Nevertheless, it highly
depends on the hypothesis that the embedded watermarks in the network outputs
are consistent. When the attacker uses some common data augmentation attacks
(e.g., rotate, crop, and resize) during surrogate model training, it will
totally fail because the underlying watermark consistency is destroyed. To
mitigate this issue, we propose a new watermarking methodology, namely
``structure consistency'', based on which a new deep structure-aligned model
watermarking algorithm is designed. Specifically, the embedded watermarks are
designed to be aligned with physically consistent image structures, such as
edges or semantic regions. Experiments demonstrate that our method is much more
robust than the baseline method in resisting data augmentation attacks for
model IP protection. Besides that, we further test the generalization ability
and robustness of our method to a broader range of circumvention attacks.

inter-cell-interference (ICI). Specifically, the coordinated zero-forcing (ZF)
precoding is used to cancel the ICI at the users located near the centers of
the cells, whereas the joint transmission (JT) is employed to eliminate the ICI
at the users located at the edge of both cells and to improve their receptions
as well. Furthermore, two multiple access techniques are invoked within each

works explore the commonsense captions by using separate networks for different
commonsense types, which is time-consuming and lacks mining the interaction of

types in a unified network, which encourages the interaction between the clues
of multiple commonsense descriptions, event-wise captions and videos. Then,
there are two steps to achieve the word-level reasoning: (1) a memory module
records the history predicted sequence from the previous generation processes;
(2) a memory-routed multi-head attention (MMHA) module updates the word-level
attention maps by incorporating the history information from the memory module
into the transformer decoder for word-level reasoning. Moreover, the multimodal
features are used to make full use of diverse knowledge for commonsense
reasoning. Experiments and abundant analysis on the large-scale

  We initiate and study the problem of evacuating 2 robots in the wireless

moves are measured in the underlying metric space. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first study of a search-type problem with mobile agents
in more general metric spaces. The problem is particularly challenging since
even the circumference of the $\ell_p$ unit disks have been the subject of
technical studies. In our main result, and after identifying and utilizing the
very few symmetries of $\ell_p$ unit disks, we design \emph{optimal evacuation
algorithms} that vary with $p$. Our main technical contributions are two-fold.
First, in our upper bound results, we provide (nearly) closed formulae for the
worst case cost of our algorithms. Second, and most importantly, our lower
bounds' arguments reduce to a novel observation in convex geometry which
analyzes trade-offs between arc and chord lengths of $\ell_p$ unit disks as the
endpoints of the arcs (chords) change position around the perimeter of the
disk, which we believe is interesting in its own right. Part of our argument
pertaining to the latter property relies on a computer assisted numerical

input image on pixel-level. This strategy is commonly over-demanding for OSR
since class-specific features are generally contained in target objects, not in

method with a streamlined architecture, Maximal Mutual Information Open Set

class-specific features by maximizing the mutual information between the given
input and its latent features across multiple scales. Meanwhile, to further
reduce the open space risk, latent features are constrained to class
conditional Gaussian distributions by a KL-divergence loss function. In this

  Degradation Cost",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Battery energy storage systems are providing increasing level of benefits to
power grid operations by decreasing the resource uncertainty and supporting
frequency regulation. Thus, it is crucial to obtain the optimal policy for
battery to efficiently provide these grid-services while accounting for its
degradation cost. To solve the optimal battery control (OBC) problem using the
powerful reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, this paper aims to develop a
new representation of the cycle-based battery degradation model according to
the rainflow algorithm. As the latter depends on the full trajectory, existing
work has to rely on linearized approximation for converting it into
instantaneous terms for the Markov Decision Process (MDP) based formulation. We
propose a new MDP form by introducing additional state variables that can
easily keep track of past switching points for determining the cycle depth. The
proposed degradation model allows to adopt the powerful deep Q-Network (DQN)
based RL algorithm to efficiently search for the OBC policy. Numerical tests
using real market data have demonstrated the performance improvements of the
proposed cycle-based degradation model in enhancing the battery operations
while mitigating its degradation, as compared to earlier work using the
linearized approximation.

Liouville type theorem for the associated fully nonlinear M\""obius invariant
degenerate elliptic equations, a priori estimates of first and second order
derivatives of solutions to the $\sigma_2$-Nirenberg problem, and a B\^ocher
type theorem for the associated fully nonlinear M\""obius invariant elliptic

sequence of blow-up solutions to the $\sigma_2$-Nirenberg problem. In
particular, we prove that there can be at most one blow-up point for such a
blow-up sequence of solutions. This, together with a Kazdan-Warner type
identity, allows us to prove $L^\infty$ a priori estimates for solutions of the
$\sigma_2$-Nirenberg problem under some simple generic hypothesis. The higher

Schauder. In turn, the existence of solutions to the $\sigma_2$-Nirenberg

second order fully nonlinear elliptic operators.

applications, many works exploit the synthetic images to train the model for
real-word image semantic segmentation, i.e., Synthetic-to-Real Semantic
Segmentation (SRSS). However, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained
on the source synthetic data may not generalize well to the target real-world
data. In this work, we propose two simple yet effective texture randomization
mechanisms, Global Texture Randomization (GTR) and Local Texture Randomization
(LTR), for Domain Generalization based SRSS. GTR is proposed to randomize the
texture of source images into diverse unreal texture styles. It aims to
alleviate the reliance of the network on texture while promoting the learning
of the domain-invariant cues. In addition, we find the texture difference is
not always occurred in entire image and may only appear in some local areas.
Therefore, we further propose a LTR mechanism to generate diverse local regions
for partially stylizing the source images. Finally, we implement a
regularization of Consistency between GTR and LTR (CGL) aiming to harmonize the
two proposed mechanisms during training. Extensive experiments on five publicly

various SRSS settings (i.e., GTA5/SYNTHIA to Cityscapes/BDDS/Mapillary)

Existing algorithms bypass such trade-off by a multi-stage training process:
pre-training on imbalanced set and fine-tuning on balanced set. Though
achieving promising performance, not only are they sensitive to the
generalizability of the pre-trained model, but also not easily integrated into

reinforcement learning process is developed for flexible wing aerial
structures. It employs a model-free control policy framework and a guaranteed
convergent adaptive learning architecture to solve the system's Bellman
optimality equation. A Riccati equation is derived and shown to be equivalent
to solving the underlying Bellman equation. The online reinforcement learning
solution is implemented using means of an adaptive-critic mechanism. The
controller is proven to be asymptotically stable in the Lyapunov sense. It is
assessed through computer simulations and its superior performance is
demonstrated on two scenarios under different operating conditions.

the unitary evolution of closed quantum systems, dissipation and noise are
vital in understanding the dynamics of practical quantum systems. In this work,
we experimentally demonstrate a digital simulation of an open quantum system in
a controllable Markovian environment with the assistance of a single ancillary
qubit. By Trotterizing the quantum Liouvillians, the continuous evolution of an
open quantum system is effectively realized, and its application in error
mitigation is demonstrated by adjusting the simulated noise intensities.
High-order Trotter for open quantum dynamics is also experimentally
investigated and shows higher accuracy. Our results represent a significant

  the Solar Chromosphere",,,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A 2.5D numerical model of magnetoacoustic-Alfv\'en linear mode conversions in
the partially ionised low solar atmosphere induced by the Hall effect is
surveyed, varying magnetic field strength and inclination, and wave frequency
and horizontal wave number. It is found that only the magnetic component of
wave energy is subject to Hall-mediated conversions to Alfv\'en wave-energy via
a process of polarisation rotation. This strongly boosts direct mode conversion
between slow magneto\-acoustic and Alfv\'en waves in the quiet low
chromosphere, even at mHz frequencies. However, fast waves there, which are
predominantly acoustic in nature, are only subject to Hall- induced conversion
via an indirect two-step process: (i) a geometry-induced fast-slow
transformation near the Alfv\'en-acoustic equipartition height $z_{\rm eq}$;
and (ii) Hall-rotation of the fast wave in $z>z_{\rm eq}$. Thus, for the
two-stage process to yield upgoing Alfv\'en waves, $z_{\rm eq}$ must lie below
or within the Hall-effective window $0\lesssim z\lesssim700$ km. Magnetic field
strengths over 100 G are required to achieve this. Since the potency of this
Hall effect varies inversely with the field strength but directly with the wave
frequency, only frequencies above about 100 mHz are significantly affected by
the two-stage process. Increasing magnetic field inclination $\theta$ generally
strengthens the Hall convertibility, but the horizontal wavenumber $k_x$ has
little effect. The direct and indirect Hall mechanisms both have implications
for the ability of MHD waves excited at the photosphere to reach the upper
chromosphere, and by implication the corona.

enables the edge devices to collaborate on model training in a peer-to-peer
manner without the assistance of a server. However, existing decentralized
learning frameworks usually assume perfect communication among devices, where
they can reliably exchange messages, e.g., gradients or parameters. But the
real-world communication networks are prone to packet loss and transmission
errors. Transmission reliability comes with a price. The commonly-used solution
is to adopt a reliable transportation layer protocol, e.g., transmission
control protocol (TCP), which however leads to significant communication
overhead and reduces connectivity among devices that can be supported. For a
communication network with a lightweight and unreliable communication protocol,
user datagram protocol (UDP), we propose a robust decentralized stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) approach, called Soft-DSGD, to address the unreliability
issue. Soft-DSGD updates the model parameters with partially received messages
and optimizes the mixing weights according to the link reliability matrix of
communication links. We prove that the proposed decentralized training system,
even with unreliable communications, can still achieve the same asymptotic
convergence rate as vanilla decentralized SGD with perfect communications.
Moreover, numerical results confirm the proposed approach can leverage all
available unreliable communication links to speed up convergence.

Hamiltonian, inspired from studies on double proton transfer reactions, allows
for exploring the dynamical consequences of higher index saddles on
multidimensional potential energy surfaces. Studies have shown that coupling of
low frequency transverse modes to the reaction coordinate can significantly
influence the reaction mechanism, concerted or sequential, as inferred from a
reduced dimensional analysis. Using the notion of dynamically concerted and
sequential pathways, we provide insights into the role of the transverse modes
by studying the delay times between the formation of two bonds. The delay time
distribution, used extensively in earlier studies, is placed on a firm
dynamical footing by correlating it with the phase space manifolds, determined
using the technique of Lagrangian descriptors. We establish the utility of
Lagrangian descriptors in identifying the phase space manifolds responsible for
the dynamically concerted and dynamically sequential pathways.

due to the lack of high-quality datasets. To fill this gap, in this paper we
construct two new benchmark webly supervised fine-grained datasets, termed

three sub-datasets containing a total of 53,339 web training images with 200

potential to vastly change the transportation modalities of today's society.
Although this pursuit has been initiated decades ago, there still exist open
challenges in reliably ensuring that such vehicles operate safely in open
contexts. While functional safety is a well-established concept, the question
of measuring the behavioral safety of a vehicle remains subject to research.
One way to both objectively and computationally analyze traffic conflicts is
the development and utilization of so-called criticality metrics. Contemporary
approaches have leveraged the potential of criticality metrics in various
applications related to automated driving, e.g. for computationally assessing
the dynamic risk or filtering large data sets to build scenario catalogs. As a
prerequisite to systematically choose adequate criticality metrics for such
applications, we extensively review the state of the art of criticality
metrics, their properties, and their applications in the context of automated
driving. Based on this review, we propose a suitability analysis as a
methodical tool to be used by practitioners. Both the proposed method and the
state of the art review can then be harnessed to select well-suited measurement
tools that cover an application's requirements, as demonstrated by an exemplary
execution of the analysis. Ultimately, efficient, valid, and reliable
measurements of an automated vehicle's safety performance are a key requirement
for demonstrating its trustworthiness.

  arXiv:2101.07448",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recently proposed Detection Transformer (DETR) model successfully applies
Transformer to objects detection and achieves comparable performance with
two-stage object detection frameworks, such as Faster-RCNN. However, DETR
suffers from its slow convergence. Training DETR from scratch needs 500 epochs
to achieve a high accuracy. To accelerate its convergence, we propose a simple
yet effective scheme for improving the DETR framework, namely Spatially
Modulated Co-Attention (SMCA) mechanism. The core idea of SMCA is to conduct
location-aware co-attention in DETR by constraining co-attention responses to
be high near initially estimated bounding box locations. Our proposed SMCA
increases DETR's convergence speed by replacing the original co-attention
mechanism in the decoder while keeping other operations in DETR unchanged.
Furthermore, by integrating multi-head and scale-selection attention designs
into SMCA, our fully-fledged SMCA can achieve better performance compared to
DETR with a dilated convolution-based backbone (45.6 mAP at 108 epochs vs. 43.3
mAP at 500 epochs). We perform extensive ablation studies on COCO dataset to
validate SMCA. Code is released at https://github.com/gaopengcuhk/SMCA-DETR .

fb$^{-1}$ collected at a center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=3.773$ GeV by the
BESIII detector, the decay $D^0 \to\omega\phi$ is observed for the first time.
The branching fraction is measured to be $(6.48 \pm 0.96 \pm 0.40)\times
10^{-4}$ with a significance of $6.3 \sigma$, where the first and second
uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively. An angular analysis
reveals that the $\phi$ and $\omega$ mesons from the $D^0 \to \omega \phi$
decay are transversely polarized. The $95\%$ confidence level upper limit on
longitudinal polarization fraction is set to be less than $0.24$, which is
inconsistent with current theoretical expectations and challenges our
understanding of the underlying dynamics in charm meson decays.

the harsh propagation loss and blockage issue of millimeter-wave communication.
However, UAV communication systems suffer from energy consumption, which limits
the flying time of UAVs. In this paper, we propose several UAV energy
consumption minimization techniques through the aid of multiple intelligent
reflecting surfaces (IRSs). In specific, we introduce a tractable model to
effectively capture the characteristics of multiple IRSs and multiple user
equipments (UEs). Then, we derive a closed form expression for the UE
achievable rate, resulting in tractable optimization problems. Accordingly, we
effectively solve the optimization problems by adopting the successive convex
approximation technique. To compensate for the high complexity of the
optimization problems, we propose a low complexity algorithm that has marginal
performance loss. In the numerical results, we show that the proposed
algorithms can save UAV energy consumption significantly compared to the
benchmark with no IRSs, justifying that exploiting the IRSs is indeed favorable
to UAV energy consumption minimization.

vulnerable to the adverse effects of the data contamination or outlying

divergence estimation procedure for panel data regression models with random
effects to achieve robustness against outliers. The robustness, as well as the
asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator, are rigorously established.
The finite-sample properties of the proposed method are investigated through an

transferring the labeled source domain's knowledge to improve the model's
discriminability on the unlabeled target domain. From a novel perspective, we
argue that the bridging between the source and target domains can be utilized
to tackle the UDA re-ID task, and we focus on explicitly modeling appropriate
intermediate domains to characterize this bridging. Specifically, we propose an
Intermediate Domain Module (IDM) to generate intermediate domains'
representations on-the-fly by mixing the source and target domains' hidden
representations using two domain factors. Based on the ""shortest geodesic path""
definition, i.e., the intermediate domains along the shortest geodesic path
between the two extreme domains can play a better bridging role, we propose two
properties that these intermediate domains should satisfy. To ensure these two
properties to better characterize appropriate intermediate domains, we enforce
the bridge losses on intermediate domains' prediction space and feature space,
and enforce a diversity loss on the two domain factors. The bridge losses aim
at guiding the distribution of appropriate intermediate domains to keep the
right distance to the source and target domains. The diversity loss serves as a
regularization to prevent the generated intermediate domains from being
over-fitting to either of the source and target domains. Our proposed method
outperforms the state-of-the-arts by a large margin in all the common UDA re-ID
tasks, and the mAP gain is up to 7.7% on the challenging MSMT17 benchmark. Code

promising test of the black hole nature. Recently, EHT collaboration gave new
constraints on the shadow size at 68\% confidence levels. In this work, we
consider the new constrains on the black hole spin and charge for the Kerr and
Kerr-Newmann black holes via the local curvature radius. For the Kerr black
holes, the cases with high spin and large inclination angle are ruled out. For
the Kerr-Newmann black holes, two new characteristic constrained patterns for
low and high black hole spins are given. Near extremal black holes are always
excluded unless for the high spin and low inclination angle. Moreover, we find
that low black hole spin and charge can pass these constraints as expected.
These results suggest that this approach of curvature radius is effective on
constraining black hole parameters. We expect the local concept of the
curvature radius will play a more important role on the study of the black hole
shadow in the further.

the computing devices exhibit abnormal (Byzantine) behavior and return
arbitrary results to the parameter server (PS). This behavior may be attributed
to a plethora of reasons, including system failures and orchestrated attacks.
Existing work suggests robust aggregation and/or computational redundancy to
alleviate the effect of distorted gradients. However, most of these schemes are
ineffective when an adversary knows the task assignment and can choose the
attacked workers judiciously to induce maximal damage. Our proposed method
Aspis assigns gradient computations to worker nodes using a subset-based
assignment which allows for multiple consistency checks on the behavior of a
worker node. Examination of the calculated gradients and post-processing
(clique-finding in an appropriately constructed graph) by the central node
allows for efficient detection and subsequent exclusion of adversaries from the
training process. We prove the Byzantine resilience and detection guarantees of
Aspis under weak and strong attacks and extensively evaluate the system on
various large-scale training scenarios. The principal metric for our
experiments is the test accuracy, for which we demonstrate a significant
improvement of about 30% compared to many state-of-the-art approaches on the

align the visual-textual fragments, like regions in images and words in
sentences, and adopt attention modules to highlight the relevance of
cross-modal semantic correspondences. However, the retrieval performance
remains unsatisfactory due to a lack of consistent representation in both
semantics and structural spaces. In this work, we propose to address the above
issue from two aspects: (i) constructing intrinsic structure (along with
relations) among the fragments of respective modalities, e.g., ""dog $\to$ play
$\to$ ball"" in semantic structure for an image, and (ii) seeking explicit
inter-modal structural and semantic correspondence between the visual and
textual modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel Structured Multi-modal
Feature Embedding and Alignment (SMFEA) model for image-sentence retrieval. In
order to jointly and explicitly learn the visual-textual embedding and the
cross-modal alignment, SMFEA creates a novel multi-modal structured module with
a shared context-aware referral tree. In particular, the relations of the
visual and textual fragments are modeled by constructing Visual Context-aware
Structured Tree encoder (VCS-Tree) and Textual Context-aware Structured Tree
encoder (TCS-Tree) with shared labels, from which visual and textual features
can be jointly learned and optimized. We utilize the multi-modal tree structure
to explicitly align the heterogeneous image-sentence data by maximizing the
semantic and structural similarity between corresponding inter-modal tree
nodes. Extensive experiments on Microsoft COCO and Flickr30K benchmarks
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in comparison to the
state-of-the-art methods.

simulations. Our results show that bulk CrSBr is a magnetic semiconductor and
has the easy magnetization b-axis, hard c-axis, and intermediate a-axis. Thus,
the experimental triaxial magnetic anisotropy (MA) is well reproduced here, and
it is identified to be the joint effects of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and
magnetic dipole-dipole interaction. We find that bulk CrSBr has a strong
ferromagnetic (FM) intralayer coupling but a marginal interlayer one. We also
study CrSBr monolayer in detail and find that the intralayer FM exchange
persists and the shape anisotropy has a more pronounced contribution to the MA.
Using the parameters of the FM exchange and the triaxial MA, our Monte Carlo
simulations show that CrSBr monolayer has Curie temperature Tc = 175 K.
Moreover, we find that a uniaxial tensile (compressive) strain along the a (b)

Betting exchanges act as online platforms on which bettors can find willing

to the manner in which electronic financial exchanges, such as major stock
markets, act as platforms that allow traders to find willing counterparties to

crucial problem. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is a promising tool for
analyzing safety of vehicles for low-dimensional systems. However, reachability
suffers from the curse of dimensionality, making its direct application to more
than two vehicles intractable. Recent works have made it tractable to guarantee
safety for 3 and 4 vehicles with reachability. However, the number of vehicles

reachability-based approach that guarantees safety for any number of vehicles
while vehicles complete their objectives of visiting multiple targets
efficiently, given any K-vehicle collision avoidance algorithm where K can in
general be a small number. We achieve this by developing an approach to group
vehicles into clusters efficiently and a control strategy that guarantees
safety for any in-cluster and cross-cluster pair of vehicles for all time. Our
proposed method is scalable to large number of vehicles with little computation
overhead. We demonstrate our proposed approach with a simulation on 15

effects of factors on crashes under autonomous and conventional driving modes.
This study obtained 154 publicly available autonomous vehicle crash data (70
for the autonomous driving mode and 84 for the conventional driving mode), and
36 explanatory variables were extracted from three categories, including
environment, roads, and vehicles. Then, a hierarchical Bayesian approach was
applied to analyze the impacting factors on crash type and severity under both
driving modes. The results showed that some factors affected both driving
modes, but their degrees were different. For example, the presence of turning
movement had a greater impact on the crash severity under the conventional
driving mode, while the presence of turning movement led to a larger decrease
in the likelihood of rear-end crashes under the autonomous driving mode. More
influencing factors only had a significant impact on one of the driving modes.
For example, in the autonomous driving mode, two sidewalks decreased the
severity of crashes, and on-street parking was positively associated with
rear-end crashes, but they were not significant in the conventional driving
mode. This study could contribute to the understanding and development of
autonomous driving systems and the better coordination between autonomous

find an optimal reordering solution based on predefined features of a given
matrix and loss function. However, prior knowledge of the appropriate features
to use or structural patterns in a given adjacency matrix is not always
available. In such a case, performing the reordering based on data-driven
feature extraction without assuming a specific structure in an adjacency matrix
is preferable. Recently, a neural-network-based matrix reordering method called
DeepTMR has been proposed to perform this function. However, it is limited to a
two-mode reordering (i.e., the rows and columns are reordered separately) and
it cannot be applied in the one-mode setting (i.e., the same node order is used

largely empirical. High Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation (HFCWO) is one of

interact with the lung biomechanics. Hence, we study idealised HFCWO
manipulations applied to a mathematical and numerical model of the biomechanics
of the lung. The lung is represented by a fluid--structure interaction model
based on an airway tree that is coupled to an homogeneous elastic medium. We
show that our model is driven by two dimensionless numbers that drive the
effect of the idealised HFCWO manipulation on the model of the lung. Our model
allow to analyze the stress applied to an idealised mucus by the air--mucus
interaction and by the airway walls deformation. This stress behaves as a
buffer and has the effect of reducing the stress needed to overcome the
idealised mucus yield stress. Moreover, our model predicts the existence of an
optimal range of the working frequencies of HFCWO. This range is in agreement
with the frequencies actually used by practitioners during HFCWO maneuvers.
Finally, our model suggests that analyzing the mouth airflow during HFCWO
maneuvers could allow to estimate the compliance and the hydrodynamic
resistance of the lung of a patient.

have tried to look at laws from an unusual point of view. The idea behind our

work on solving a specific research problem, and the result was expressed in a
specific mathematical form. We asked ourselves whether it is possible to modify
the statement of the problem, and/or modify the form of expression of the law
in order to see new facets of a well-known scientific statement? The result was
successful in relation to Omori's law, according to which the frequency of
aftershocks hyperbolically decreases over time. The modified formulation of the
problem was to find a differential equation describing the time evolution of
aftershocks. We found a simple differential model, within the framework of
which the concept of deactivation of the earthquake source is introduced. The
question of dependence of the deactivation factor on the magnitude of main
shock is analyzed theoretically and experimentally. A monotonic decrease in the
deactivation factor with an increase in the magnitude of the main shock has
been reliably established. Other possible applications of the proposed
methodological technique are considered. In particular, it is indicated how to
overcome the contradiction between the Omori law and the law of energy

magnetic transitions on vacancy formation energies are found to be more
important in bcc Fe than in fcc Fe and Ni. The distinct behaviour is correlated
to the relative roles of longitudinal and transversal spin excitations. At
variance with the bcc-Fe case, we note a clear effect of longitudinal spin
excitations on the magnetic free energy of vacancy formation in fcc Fe and Ni,
leading to its steady variation above the respective magnetic transition

opposite to the one of the transversal excitations. Regarding fcc Ni, although

brighten at least 6 months. The X-ray spectra are consistent with nearly
critical accretion onto black holes of a few 10^3 to 10^8 M_Sun, although
supercritical accretion is possibly taking place. In two TDEs, a spectral
hardening is observed 6 months after the discovery. Four TDEs showed an optical

optical activity. All 13 TDEs are optically faint, with Lopt/Lx<0.3 (Lopt and
Lx being the g-band and 0.2-6 keV luminosity, respectively). We have
constructed a TDE X-ray luminosity function, which can be fit by a power law
with a slope of -0.6+/-0.2, similar to the trend observed for optically
selected TDEs. The total rate is estimated at (1.1+/-0.5)10^-5 TDEs per galaxy

suggests that X-ray bright events constitute a minority of TDEs, consistent
with models predicting that X-rays can only be observed from directions close

explore the possibility of tuning electronic correlations of the tTLG via a
vertical pressure. A full tight-binding model is used to accurately describe
the pressure-dependent interlayer interactions. Our results show that pressure
can push a relatively larger twist angle (for instance, $1.89^{\circ}$) tTLG to
reach the flat-band regime. Next, we obtain the relationship between the
pressure-induced magic angle value and the critical pressure. These critical
pressure values are almost half of that needed in the case of twisted bilayer
graphene. Then, plasmonic properties are further investigated in the flat band
tTLG with both zero-pressure magic angle and pressure-induced magic angle. Two
plasmonic modes are detected in these two kinds of flat band samples. By
comparison, one is a high energy damping-free plasmon mode that shows similar
behavior, and the other is a low energy plasmon mode (flat-band plasmon) that
shows obvious differences. The flat-band plasmon is contributed by both
interband and intraband transitions of flat bands, and its divergence is due to
the various shape of the flat bands in tTLG with zero-pressure and
pressure-induced magic angles. This may provide an efficient way of tuning
between regimes with strong and weak electronic interactions in one sample and
overcoming the technical requirement of precise control of the twist angle in
the study of correlated physics.

establish cross-view correspondence based on noisy 2D pose estimates, it
directly estimates and tracks 3D poses from a 3D voxel-based representation

the current ocean front detection methods either have low detection accuracy or
most can only detect the occurrence of ocean front by binary classification,
rarely considering the differences of the characteristics of multiple ocean
fronts in different sea areas. In order to solve the above problems, we propose
a semantic segmentation network called location and seasonality enhanced

network, we first design a channel supervision unit structure, which integrates
the seasonal characteristics of the ocean front itself and the contextual
information to improve the detection accuracy. We also introduce a location
attention mechanism to adaptively assign attention weights to the fronts
according to their frequently occurred sea area, which can further improve the
accuracy of multi-class ocean front detection. Compared with other semantic
segmentation methods and current representative ocean front detection method,
the experimental results demonstrate convincingly that our method is more
effective.

phenomena that are absent in the Hermitian systems. One of these key features
is the extreme eigenstate localization of eigenstates, also known as
non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), which occurs in open chains. However, many
new and peculiar non-Hermitian characteristics of the eigenstates and
eigenvlaues that emerge when two such non-Hermitian chains are coupled together
remain largely unexplored. Here, we report various new avenues of eigenstate
localization in coupled non-Hermitian chains with dissimilar inverse skin
lengths in which the NHSE can be switched on and off by the inter-chain
coupling amplitude. A very small inter-chain strength causes the NHSE to be
present at both ends of an anti-symmetric coupled system because of the weak
hybridization of the eigenstates of the individual chains. The eigenspectrum
under open boundary conditions (OBC) exhibits a discontinuous jump known as the
critical NHSE (CNHSE) as its size increases. However, when the hybridization
between eigenstates becomes significant in a system with strong inter-chain
coupling, the NHSE and CNHSE vanish. Moreover, a peculiar ""half-half skin
localization"" occurs in composite chains with opposite signs of inverse decay
lengths, where half of the eigenstates are exponentially localized at one chain
and the remainder of the eigenstates on the other chain. Our results provide a
new twist and insights for non-Hermitian phenomena in coupled non-Hermitian

the context of first-principles modeling of electrochemistry and

to model the latter electrodes and the reactive surface chemistry at them

surface density of Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) is proportional to column
density to some power, $\mu$. The aim of this work was to determine if column
density alone is sufficient to explain the locations of Class 0/I YSOs within
Serpens South, Serpens Core, Ophiuchus, NGC1333 and IC348, or if there is
clumping or avoidance that would point to additional influences on the star
formation. Using the O-ring test as a summary statistic, 95 per cent confidence
envelopes were produced for different values of $\mu$ from probability models
made using the Herschel column density maps. The YSOs were tested against four
distribution models: the best-estimate of $\mu$ for the region, $\mu=0$ above a
minimum column density threshold and zero probability elsewhere, $\mu=1$, and
the power-law that best represents the five regions as a collective, $\mu=2.05
\pm 0.20$. Results showed that $\mu=2.05$ model was consistent with the
majority of regions and, for those regions, the spatial distribution of YSOs at
a given column density is consistent with being random. Serpens South and
NGC1333 rejected the $\mu = 2.05$ model on small scales of $\sim 0.15

improve the model. On scales above 0.15 pc, the positions of YSOs in all five

Consequently, the relativistic electrons escape to a larger area where the
ambient photon field, which is related to Accretion Disk MHD Winds, could play
a central role in the gamma-ray emission. This model explains the Blazar

susceptibility taking into account the collective dynamics of the excitonic
order parameter. In the inversion-symmetric EI, the collective order parameter
motion is activated at second order of the external field and its effects arise
in THG. We find three peaks in the THG susceptibility at energies $\hbar \Omega
= \Delta_g/3$, $\Delta_g/2$, and $\Delta_g$, where $\Delta_g$ is the band gap.
While the THG response at $\Delta_g/3$ is caused by bare three-photon
excitation of the independent particle across the band gap, the latter two
peaks involve the motion of the order parameter activated at second order. The
resulting resonant peaks are prominent in particular in the BCS regime but they
become less significant in the BEC regime. We demonstrate that the resonant
peak originated by the collective excitation is observable in the temperature
profile of the THG intensity. Our study suggests that the THG measurement

of SLRs supported by a vertical metal-insulator-metal nanograting, which is
embedded in a homogeneous dielectric environment. Simulation results show that
under normal incidence, quadrupolar SLR with linewidth of 1~nm and high quality
factor of 979 can be excited in the near-infrared regime, and that under
oblique incidence, out-of-plane dipolar SLRs of relatively large quality
factors (>=150) can be launched. By varying the incidence angle, the SLR
wavelength can be continuously tuned over an extremely broadband range of 750
nm, covering most of the near-infrared regime, and the quality factor decreases
exponentially. Remarkably, the resonance lineshape can also be dynamically
tuned from an asymmetric Fano-shaped dip to a peak, a dip/peak pair, and a
perfect symmetric Lorentzian peak, suggesting the appearance of the band
reversal effect. We expect the high-Q SLRs with broadband tunability and
tunable lineshapes will find potential applications in enhanced nanoscale
light-matter interactions in nanolasers, nonlinear optics and sensing.

However, the wide range of these models' applications for clinical work has
been limited by the lagging of imaging techniques. Thus, we propose a novel
framework based on a teacher-student architecture for the accurate colorectal
polyp classification (CPC) through directly using white-light (WL) colonoscopy
images in the examination. In practice, during training, the auxiliary NBI
images are utilized to train a teacher network and guide the student network to
acquire richer feature representation from WL images. The feature transfer is
realized by domain alignment and contrastive learning. Eventually the final
student network has the ability to extract aligned features from only WL images
to facilitate the CPC task. Besides, we release the first public-available
paired CPC dataset containing WL-NBI pairs for the alignment training.
Quantitative and qualitative evaluation indicates that the proposed method
outperforms the previous methods in CPC, improving the accuracy by 5.6%with
very fast speed.

both vehicles and facilities are capacitated. Before, such algorithms were only
known for the special case where facilities are uncapacitated or where their

lower bounds that are known to approximate the optimal solution value well in
the uncapacitated case can be off by an arbitrary factor in the general case.
We show that this issue can be overcome by a bifactor approximation algorithm

and high cadence observations provided by Insight-HXMT, we were able to find
for the first time evidence for a transition of the accretion regime. At high
luminosity, above the critical luminosity $6.7\times10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$, the
cyclotron absorption line energy anti-correlates with luminosity. Below the
critical luminosity, a positive correlation is observed. The 1A~0535+262
becomes, therefore, the second source after V~0332+53, which clearly shows an
anti-correlation above and transition between correlation and anti-correlation
around the critical luminosity. The evolution of both the observed CRSF line
energy and broadband X-ray continuum spectrum throughout the outburst exhibits
significant differences during the rising and fading phases: that is, for a
similar luminosity the spectral parameters take different values which results
in hysteresis patterns for several spectral parameters including the cyclotron
line energy. We argue that, similarly to V~0332+53, these changes might be
related to different geometry of the emission region in rising and declining

areas, and fill them with poison ink (information) to generate the trigger
pattern. As the image structure can keep its semantic meaning during the data
transformation, such trigger pattern is inherently robust to data
transformations. Then we leverage a deep injection network to embed such

existing popular backdoor attack methods, Poison Ink outperforms both in
stealthiness and robustness. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate
Poison Ink is not only general to different datasets and network architectures,

  of Space","14 pages, 6 figures and 3 tables",,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The third (or organismic) view of space states that space is neither lifeless
nor neutral, but a living structure capable of being more living or less
living, thus different fundamentally from the first two mechanistic views of
space: Newtonian absolute space and Leibnizian relational space. The living
structure is defined as a physical and mathematical structure or simply
characterized by the recurring notion (or inherent hierarchy) of far more small
substructures than large ones. This paper seeks to lay out a new geography as a
science of the Earth's surface founded on the third view of space. The new
geography aims not only to better understand geographic forms and processes but
also - maybe more importantly - to make geographic space or the Earth's surface
to be living or more living. After introducing two fundamental laws of
geography: Tobler's law on spatial dependence (or homogeneity) and scaling law
on spatial heterogeneity, we argue that these two laws are fundamental laws of
living structure that favor statistics over exactitude, because the former (or
statistics) tends to make a structure more living than the latter (or
exactitute). We present the concept of living structure through some working
examples and make it clear how a living structure differs from a non-living
structure, under the organismic worldview that was first conceived by the
British philosopher Alfred Whitehead (1861-1947). In order to make a structure
or space living or more living, we introduce two design principles -
differentiation and adaptation - using two paintings and two city plans. The
new geography is a science of living structure, dealing with a wide range of
scales, from the smallest scale of ornaments on walls to the scale of the
entire Earth's surface.

technology based on strong light-matter coupling. Here, we extend the coupling
beyond the standard light-matter interaction paradigm, emulating Dicke
cooperativity in a terahertz metasurface with N meta-atoms. Cooperative
enhancement manifested in the form of matter-matter coupling, through the
hybridization of localized surface plasmon resonance in individual meta-atoms
and surface lattice resonance due to the periodic array of the meta-atoms. By
varying the lattice constant of the array, we observe a clear anticrossing
behavior, a signature of strong coupling. Furthermore, through engineering of
the capacitive split-gap in the meta-atoms, the coupling rate was cooperatively
enhanced into the ultrastrong coupling regime by a factor of N^0.5. This
room-temperature technology serves as a convenient quantum emulator of the
dynamics of a qubit with a giant dipole moment coherently driven by a single

parallax (TPRX; i.e., a nearby disk lens) will also tend to produce a large
lens-source relative proper motion ($\mu_{\rm rel}$), source proper motion
(${\boldsymbol\mu}_{\rm S}$) measurements in general provide a strong test of
TPRX signals, which \citet{gould13} showed were an important probe of
free-floating planet (FFP) candidates. As a case study, we report a
single-lens/single-source microlensing event designated as OGLE-2019-BLG-1058.
For this event, the short timescale ($\sim 2.5$ days) and very fast $\mu_{\rm

FFP candidate located in the disk of our Galaxy. For this event, we find a TPRX
signal consistent with a disk FFP, but at low significance. A direct
measurement of the ${\boldsymbol\mu}_{\rm S}$ shows that the large $\mu_{\rm
rel}$ is due to an extreme ${\boldsymbol\mu}_{\rm S}$, and thus, the lens is
consistent with being a very low-mass star in the bulge and the TPRX
measurement is likely spurious. By contrast, we show how a precise measurement
of ${\boldsymbol\mu}_{\rm S}$ with the mean properties of the bulge proper
motion distribution would have given the opposite result; i.e., provided
supporting evidence for an FFP in the disk and the TPRX measurement.

Furthermore, few studies have employed AI interpretability tools to investigate
the feature importance of transaction data, which is crucial for the black-box

detection model is composed of two deep neural networks, which are trained in
an unsupervised and adversarial manner. Precisely, the generator is an
AutoEncoder aiming to reconstruct genuine transaction data, while the
discriminator is a fully-connected network for fraud detection. The explanation
module has three white-box explainers in charge of interpretations of the
AutoEncoder, discriminator, and the whole detection model, respectively.
Experimental results show the state-of-the-art performances of our fraud

prediction analyses by three explainers are presented, offering a clear
perspective on how each feature of an instance of interest contributes to the

this approach relies on the derivation of so-called flow equations, which
describe the change of the quantum effective action under the variation of a
coarse-graining parameter. In the present work, we discuss in detail a novel
approach to solve such flow equations. This approach relies on the fact that RG
equations can be rewritten such that they exhibit similarities with the
conservation laws of fluid dynamics. This observation can be exploited in
different ways. First of all, we show that this allows to employ powerful
numerical techniques developed in the context of fluid dynamics to solve RG
equations. In particular, it allows us to reliably treat the emergence of
nonanalytic behavior in the RG flow of the effective action as it is expected
to occur in studies of, e.g., spontaneous symmetry breaking. Second, the
analogy between RG equations and fluid dynamics offers the opportunity to gain
novel insights into RG flows and their interpretation in general, including the
irreversibility of RG flows. We work out this connection in practice by
applying it to zero-dimensional quantum-field theoretical models. The
generalization to higher-dimensional models is also discussed. Our findings are

  Spectrogram Augmentation","Accepted at ACM/SIGCHI ICMI'21",,,,"cs.SD cs.AI cs.HC eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Automatic speech emotion recognition (SER) is a challenging task that plays a
crucial role in natural human-computer interaction. One of the main challenges
in SER is data scarcity, i.e., insufficient amounts of carefully labeled data
to build and fully explore complex deep learning models for emotion
classification. This paper aims to address this challenge using a transfer
learning strategy combined with spectrogram augmentation. Specifically, we
propose a transfer learning approach that leverages a pre-trained residual
network (ResNet) model including a statistics pooling layer from speaker
recognition trained using large amounts of speaker-labeled data. The statistics
pooling layer enables the model to efficiently process variable-length input,
thereby eliminating the need for sequence truncation which is commonly used in
SER systems. In addition, we adopt a spectrogram augmentation technique to
generate additional training data samples by applying random time-frequency
masks to log-mel spectrograms to mitigate overfitting and improve the
generalization of emotion recognition models. We evaluate the effectiveness of
our proposed approach on the interactive emotional dyadic motion capture
(IEMOCAP) dataset. Experimental results indicate that the transfer learning and
spectrogram augmentation approaches improve the SER performance, and when
combined achieve state-of-the-art results.

ultracold RbSr ($^2\Sigma^+$) $+$ RbSr ($^2\Sigma^+$) collisions occurring on
the singlet as well as the triplet potential. At ultracold energies reactions
are energetically possible if they release energy, i.e., they are exoergic. The
exoergicity of reactions between RbSr molecules producing diatomic molecules
are known experimentally. We extend this to reactions producing triatomic
molecules by calculating the binding energy of the triatomic reaction products.
We find that, in addition to the formation of Rb$_2$+2Sr and Rb$_2$+Sr$_2$ in
singlet collisions, also the formation of Sr$_2$Rb+Rb and Rb$_2$Sr+Sr in both
singlet and triplet collisions is exoergic. Hence, the formation of these
reaction products is energetically possible in ultracold collisions. For all
exoergic reactions the exoergicity is larger than 1000 cm$^{-1}$. We also find
barrierless qualitative reaction paths leading to the formation of singlet
Rb$_2$+2Sr and both singlet and triplet Rb$_2$Sr+Sr and Sr$_2$Rb+Rb reaction
products and show that a reaction path with at most a submerged barrier exists
for the creation of the singlet Rb$_2$+Sr$_2$ reaction product. Because of the
existence of these reactions we expect ultracold RbSr collisions to result in
almost-universal loss even on the triplet potential. Our results can be
contrasted with collisions between alkali-diatoms, where the formation of
triatomic reaction products is endoergic, and with collisions between ultracold
SrF molecules, where during triplet collisions only the spin-forbidden
formation of singlet SrF$_2$ is exoergic.

realism reached by recent fake-generating technologies, threatens to impair the
trustworthiness of online information sources. The process of uploading and
sharing data tends to hinder standard media forensic analyses, since multiple
re-sharing steps progressively hide the traces of past manipulations. At the
same time though, new traces are introduced by the platforms themselves,
enabling the reconstruction of the sharing history of digital objects, with
possible applications in information flow monitoring and source identification.
In this work, we propose a supervised framework for the reconstruction of image
sharing chains on social media platforms. The system is structured as a cascade
of backtracking blocks, each of them tracing back one step of the sharing chain
at a time. Blocks are designed as ensembles of classifiers trained to analyse
the input image independently from one another by leveraging different feature
representations that describe both content and container of the media object.
Individual decisions are then properly combined by a late fusion strategy.
Results highlight the advantages of employing multiple clues, which allow
accurately tracing back up to three steps along the sharing chain.

metric geometry to study the propagation of COVID-19 across the United States.
Using a geodesic Wasserstein metric, we analyse discrepancies between the
density functions of new case counts on any given day, incorporating the
geographic spread of cases. First, we apply this to identify the periods during
which the changes in the geographic distribution of COVID-19 were most
profound. The greatest shift occurred between May and June of 2020, when
COVID-19 shifted from mostly dominating the Northeastern states to a wider
distribution across the country. We support our findings with a new measure of
the extent of geodesic variance of a distribution, demonstrating that the
geographic imprint of COVID-19 was most concentrated in May 2020. Next, we
investigate whether the epidemic exhibited meaningful patterns of spatial
reversion, where similar geographic distributions return later. We identify
broad similarity between the spread of COVID-19 across the US between the
second and third waves, and to a lesser extent, the reemergence of the first
wave's Northeastern dominance closer to the present day. This methodology could
provide new insights for analysts to monitor the dynamical spread of epidemics

framework we introduce could be applied to a variety of problems evolving over

true loss in terms of the proposed empirical loss and is bounded by (i) the
Rademacher complexity, (ii) the discrepancy, (iii) and a penalty term. Using a
signed gradient feedback to find a personalised NN at each device, it is also
proven to converge in a Rayleigh flat fading (in the uplink) channel, at a rate

on hadronic targets, including neutrons, protons and hyperons. We extend
previous analyses by including momentum dependent form factors, which account
for hadronic structure, and incorporating the effect of baryon strong
interactions in the dense neutron star interior, rather than modelling the
baryons as a free Fermi gas. The combination of these effects suppresses the DM
capture rate over a wide mass range, thus increasing the cross section for
which the capture rate saturates the geometric limit. In addition, variation in
the capture rate associated with the choice of neutron star equation of state
is reduced. For proton targets, the use of the interacting baryon approach to
obtain the correct Fermi energy is essential for an accurate evaluation of the
capture rate in the Pauli-blocked regime. For heavy neutron stars, which are
expected to contain exotic matter, we identify cases where DM scattering on
hyperons contributes significantly to the total capture rate. Despite smaller
neutron star capture rates, compared to existing analyses, we find that the
projected DM-nucleon scattering sensitivity greatly exceeds that of nuclear
recoil experiments for a wide DM mass range.

successful if the found robot is inside SR. After that, the second phase, based

measured and used for comparison. We compare our algorithms with two similar

it is shown that the optimization problem can be analytically solved in a
variational framework, leading to, nonlinear, closed-form algebraic solutions
for the characteristic function, which are then solved, in every time-step, via
fixed point methods based on a pseudo-energy cutting algorithm combined with
the exact fulfillment of the constraint, at every iteration of the non-linear
algorithm, via a bisection method. The issue of the ill-posedness (mesh
dependency) of the topological solution, is then easily solved via a Laplacian
smoothing of that pseudo-energy. In the aforementioned context, a number of
(3D) topological structural optimization benchmarks are solved, and the
solutions obtained with the explored closed-form solution method, are analyzed,
and compared, with their solution through an alternative level set method.
Although the obtained results, in terms of the cost function and topology
designs, are very similar in both methods, the associated computational cost is
about five times smaller in the closedform solution method this possibly being
one of its advantages.

Hanfeng Li, improving two inequalities with two equalities, respectively, for
sofic mean dimension of typical actions. On the one hand, we study sofic mean
dimension of full shifts, for which, Li provided an upper bound which however
is not optimal. We prove a more delicate estimate from above, which is optimal
for sofic mean dimension of full shifts over arbitrary alphabets (i.e. compact
metrizable spaces). Our refinement, together with the techniques (in relation
to an estimate from below) in the paper entitled ``Mean dimension of full
shifts'' by Masaki Tsukamoto, eventually allows us to get the exact value of
sofic mean dimension of full shifts over any finite dimensional compact
metrizable spaces. On the other hand, we investigate finite group actions. In
contrast to the case that the acting group is infinite (and amenable), Li
showed that if a finite group acts continuously on a finite dimensional compact
metrizable space, then sofic mean dimension may be different from (strictly
less than) the classical (i.e. amenable) mean dimension (an explicitly known
value in this case). We strengthen this result by proving a sharp lower bound,
which, combining with the upper bound, gives the exact value of sofic mean
dimension for all the actions of finite groups on finite dimensional compact
metrizable spaces. Furthermore, this equality leads to a satisfactory
comparison theorem for those actions, deciding when sofic mean dimension would
coincide with classical mean dimension. Moreover, our two results, in
particular, verify for a typical class of sofic group actions that sofic mean
dimension does not depend on sofic approximation sequences.

as well as circular polarization resulting from the homochirality of biotic

LSDpol employs a spatial light modulator in the entrance slit of the

rotates as a function of slit position. The original design of LSDpol
implemented a dual-beam spectropolarimeter by combining a quarter-wave plate

  Recurrent Neural Networks",,,,,"q-bio.NC nlin.CD physics.bio-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are complex dynamical systems, capable of
ongoing activity without any driving input. The long-term behavior of
free-running RNNs, described by periodic, chaotic and fixed point attractors,
is controlled by the statistics of the neural connection weights, such as the
density $d$ of non-zero connections, or the balance $b$ between excitatory and
inhibitory connections. However, for information processing purposes, RNNs need
to receive external input signals, and it is not clear which of the dynamical
regimes is optimal for this information import. We use both the average
correlations $C$ and the mutual information $I$ between the momentary input
vector and the next system state vector as quantitative measures of information
import and analyze their dependence on the balance and density of the network.
Remarkably, both resulting phase diagrams $C(b,d)$ and $I(b,d)$ are highly
consistent, pointing to a link between the dynamical systems and the
information-processing approach to complex systems. Information import is
maximal not at the 'edge of chaos', which is optimally suited for computation,
but surprisingly in the low-density chaotic regime and at the border between
the chaotic and fixed point regime. Moreover, we find a completely new type of
resonance phenomenon, called 'Import Resonance' (IR), where the information
import shows a maximum, i.e. a peak-like dependence on the coupling strength
between the RNN and its input. IR complements Recurrence Resonance (RR), where
correlation and mutual information of successive system states peak for a
certain amplitude of noise added to the system. Both IR and RR can be exploited
to optimize information processing in artificial neural networks and might also
play a crucial role in biological neural systems.

  2021",,,"econ.TH cs.AI cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unlike tic-tac-toe or checkers, in which optimal play leads to a draw, it is
not known whether optimal play in chess ends in a win for White, a win for
Black, or a draw. But after White moves first in chess, if Black has a double
move followed by a double move of White and then alternating play, play is more
balanced because White does not always tie or lead in moves. Symbolically,
Balanced Alternation gives the following move sequence: After White's (W)
initial move, first Black (B) and then White each have two moves in a row
(BBWW), followed by the alternating sequence, beginning with W, which
altogether can be written as WB/BW/WB/WB/WB... (the slashes separate
alternating pairs of moves). Except for reversal of the 3rd and 4th moves from
WB to BW, this is the standard chess sequence. Because Balanced Alternation
lies between the standard sequence, which favors White, and a comparable
sequence that favors Black, it is highly likely to produce a draw with optimal
play, rendering chess fairer. This conclusion is supported by a computer
analysis of chess openings and how they would play out under Balanced
Alternation.

  Animalmorphic Head Design",,,,,"cs.CV cs.HC","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Head shapes play an important role in 3D character design. In this work, we
propose SimpModeling, a novel sketch-based system for helping users, especially
amateur users, easily model 3D animalmorphic heads - a prevalent kind of heads
in character design. Although sketching provides an easy way to depict desired
shapes, it is challenging to infer dense geometric information from sparse line
drawings. Recently, deepnet-based approaches have been taken to address this
challenge and try to produce rich geometric details from very few strokes.
However, while such methods reduce users' workload, they would cause less
controllability of target shapes. This is mainly due to the uncertainty of the
neural prediction. Our system tackles this issue and provides good
controllability from three aspects: 1) we separate coarse shape design and
geometric detail specification into two stages and respectively provide
different sketching means; 2) in coarse shape designing, sketches are used for
both shape inference and geometric constraints to determine global geometry,
and in geometric detail crafting, sketches are used for carving surface
details; 3) in both stages, we use the advanced implicit-based shape inference
methods, which have strong ability to handle the domain gap between freehand
sketches and synthetic ones used for training. Experimental results confirm the
effectiveness of our method and the usability of our interactive system. We
also contribute to a dataset of high-quality 3D animal heads, which are
manually created by artists.

mechanism to improve the system capacity by realizing the complementary
benefits of both the links. The dynamics of network conditions, such as fog,
dust, and sand storms compound the link switching problem and control
complexity. To address this problem, we initiate the study of deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) for link switching of hybrid FSO/RF systems.
Specifically, in this work, we focus on actor-critic called Actor/Critic-FSO/RF
and Deep-Q network (DQN) called DQN-FSO/RF for FSO/RF link switching under
atmospheric turbulences. To formulate the problem, we define the state, action,
and reward function of a hybrid FSO/RF system. DQN-FSO/RF frequently updates
the deployed policy that interacts with the environment in a hybrid FSO/RF
system, resulting in high switching costs. To overcome this, we lift this
problem to ensemble consensus-based representation learning for deep
reinforcement called DQNEnsemble-FSO/RF. The proposed novel DQNEnsemble-FSO/RF
DRL approach uses consensus learned features representations based on an
ensemble of asynchronous threads to update the deployed policy. Experimental
results corroborate that the proposed DQNEnsemble-FSO/RF's consensus-learned
features switching achieves better performance than Actor/Critic-FSO/RF,
DQN-FSO/RF, and MyOpic for FSO/RF link switching while keeping the switching
cost significantly low.

STAR-MELT automatically extracts, identifies and fits emission lines. We
summarise our analysis methods that utilises the time domain of high-resolution
stellar spectra to investigate variability in the line profiles and
corresponding emitting regions. This allows us to probe the innermost disc and
accretion structures of YSOs. Local temperatures and densities can be
determined using Boltzmann statistics, the Saha equation, and the Sobolev large
velocity gradient approximation. STAR-MELT allows for new results to be
obtained from archival data, as well as facilitating timely analysis of new
data as it is obtained. We present the results of applying STAR-MELT to three
YSOs, using spectra from UVES, XSHOOTER, FEROS, HARPS, and ESPaDOnS. We
demonstrate what can be achieved for data with disparate time sampling, for
stars with different inclinations and variability types. For EX Lupi, we
confirm the presence of a localised and stable stellar-surface hot spot
associated with the footprint of the accretion column. For GQ Lupi A, we find
that the maximum infall rate from an accretion column is correlated with lines
produced in the lowest temperatures. For CVSO109 we investigate the rapid
temporal variability of a redshifted emission wing, indicative of rotating and
infalling material in the inner disc. Our results show that STAR-MELT is a
useful tool for such analysis, as well as other applications for emission

accrete relatively more material for binary systems with the donor masses in
the range of $1.8\sim 2.4M_\odot$, the NSs accrete relatively more mass when

databases to the context of Four-valued logic so as to account for unknown,
inconsistent, true or false information under the open world assumption. In our
approach, a database is a pair (E,R) where E is the extension and R the set of
rules. The extension is a set of pairs of the form (f, v) where f is a fact and
v is a value that can be true, inconsistent or false - but not unknown (that
is, unknown facts are not stored in the database). The rules follow the form of
standard Datalog{neg} rules but, contrary to standard rules, their head may be
a negative atom. Our main contributions are as follows: (i) we give an
expression of first-degree entailment in terms of other connectors and exhibit
a functionally complete set of basic connectors not involving first-degree
entailment, (ii) we define a new operator for handling our new type of rules
and show that this operator is monotonic and continuous, thus providing an
effective way for defining and computing database semantics, and (iii) we argue
that our framework allows for the definition of a new type of updates that can
be used in most standard data integration applications.

  Robots and Systems (IROS)",,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Exploring an unknown environment without colliding with obstacles is one of
the essentials of autonomous vehicles to perform diverse missions such as
structural inspections, rescues, deliveries, and so forth. Therefore, unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are fast, agile, and have high degrees of
freedom, have been widely used. However, previous approaches have two
limitations: a) First, they may not be appropriate for exploring large-scale
environments because they mainly depend on random sampling-based path planning
that causes unnecessary movements. b) Second, they assume the pose estimation
is accurate enough, which is the most critical factor in obtaining an accurate
map. In this paper, to explore and map unknown large-scale environments rapidly
and accurately, we propose a novel exploration method that combines the
pre-calculated Peacock Trajectory with graph-based global exploration and
active loop-closing. Because the two-step trajectory that considers the
kinodynamics of UAVs is used, obstacle avoidance is guaranteed in the
receding-horizon manner. In addition, local exploration that considers the
frontier and global exploration based on the graph maximizes the speed of
exploration by minimizing unnecessary revisiting. In addition, by actively
closing the loop based on the likelihood, pose estimation performance is
improved. The proposed method's performance is verified by exploring 3D
simulation environments in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.
Finally, the proposed approach is validated in a real-world experiment.

However, such end-to-end framework suffers from the unavailability of large

distillation method that is specifically designed for knowledge distillation
from a transformer based language model to a transformer based speech model. In
this regard, we leverage the reliable and widely used bidirectional encoder

the knowledge to build an acoustic model for intent classification using the
speech. In particular, a multilevel transformer based teacher-student model is
designed, and knowledge distillation is performed across attention and hidden

We achieve an intent classification accuracy of 99.10% and 88.79% for Fluent

chain has received a lot of attention from the materials community, fewer
efforts have taken into consideration uncertainties. Those arise from a
multitude of sources and their quantification and integration in the inversion
process are essential in meeting the materials design objectives. The first
contribution of this paper is a flexible, fully probabilistic formulation of
such optimization problems that accounts for the uncertainty in the
process-structure and structure-property linkages and enables the
identification of optimal, high-dimensional, process parameters. We employ a
probabilistic, data-driven surrogate for the structure-property link which
expedites computations and enables handling of non-differential objectives. We
couple this with a novel active learning strategy, i.e. a self-supervised
collection of data, which significantly improves accuracy while requiring small
amounts of training data. We demonstrate its efficacy in optimizing the
mechanical and thermal properties of two-phase, random media but envision its
applicability encompasses a wide variety of microstructure-sensitive design
problems.

for robust active speaker detection (ASD). Traditional methods for ASD usually
operate on each candidate's pre-cropped face track separately and do not
sufficiently consider the relationships among the candidates. This potentially
limits performance, especially in challenging scenarios with low-resolution
faces, multiple candidates, etc. Our solution is a novel, unified framework
that focuses on jointly modeling multiple types of contextual information:
spatial context to indicate the position and scale of each candidate's face,
relational context to capture the visual relationships among the candidates and
contrast audio-visual affinities with each other, and temporal context to
aggregate long-term information and smooth out local uncertainties. Based on
such information, our model optimizes all candidates in a unified process for
robust and reliable ASD. A thorough ablation study is performed on several
challenging ASD benchmarks under different settings. In particular, our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin of about 15% mean Average
Precision (mAP) absolute on two challenging subsets: one with three candidate
speakers, and the other with faces smaller than 64 pixels. Together, our UniCon

highly-compressed sulphur hydride by Drozdov (Nature 525, 73 (2015)) sparked
experimental and theoretical investigations of metallic hydrides. Since then, a
dozen of superconducting binary and ternary polyhydrides have been discovered.
For instance, there are three superconducting polyhydrides of thorium: Th4H15,
ThH9, and ThH10 and four polyhydrides of yttrium: YH4, YH6, YH7, YH9. In
addition to binary and ternary hydrogen-based metallic compounds, recently
Eremets (arXiv:2109.11104) reported on the metallization of hydrogen, which
exhibits a phase transition into metallic hydrogen phase III at P>330 GPa and
T<200 K. Here we analyzed temperature-dependent resistance, R(T), in
polyhydrides of thorium, hexadeuteride of yttrium and in hydrogen phase III and
deduced the Debye temperature, $T$$_{\theta}$, and the electron-phonon coupling
constant, $\lambda_{e-ph}$, for these conductors. We found that Th4H15 phase
exhibits $\lambda_{e-ph}$ = 0.82-0.99 which is in a very good agreement with
experimental value of $\lambda_{e-ph}$ = 0.84 deduced from heat capacity
measurements (Miller, Phys. Rev. B 14, 2795 (1976)). For P63/mmc-ThH9 phase (P
= 170 GPa) we deduced $\lambda_{e-ph}$(170 GPa) = 1.46, which is in a
reasonable agreement with $\lambda_{e-ph}$ reported by Semenok (Materials Today

remarkable agreement with first-principles calculated $\lambda_{e-ph}$(174
GPa)=1.75 (Semenok, Materials Today 33, 36 (2020)). Deduced
$\lambda_{e-ph}$(172 GPa) = 1.90 for Im-3m-YD6 is also in excellent agreement
with first-principles calculated $\lambda_{e-ph}$(165 GPa)=1.80 (Troyan,

introduce an expansion of the new scheme for multi-frequency problems. We show
that the ISMC scheme presents excellent results without teleportation errors in

this paper, we cast point cloud registration into a planning problem in
reinforcement learning, which can seek the transformation between the source

registration process as a Markov decision process (MDP), we develop a latent
dynamic model of point clouds, consisting of a transformation network and
evaluation network. The transformation network aims to predict the new
transformed feature of the point cloud after performing a rigid transformation
(i.e., action) on it while the evaluation network aims to predict the alignment
precision between the transformed source point cloud and target point cloud as
the reward signal. Once the dynamic model of the point cloud is trained, we
employ the cross-entropy method (CEM) to iteratively update the planning policy
by maximizing the rewards in the point cloud registration process. Thus, the
optimal policy, i.e., the transformation between the source and target point
clouds, can be obtained via gradually narrowing the search space of the
transformation. Experimental results on ModelNet40 and 7Scene benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method can yield good registration performance in

by despiking. The features are found in active regions, quiet Sun, and coronal
holes and, in relation to solar surface area, there is a greater proportion
within coronal holes. In 96% of the cases, the despiked structure is a compact
brightening of size two arcsec or less and the remaining 4% have narrow,
elongated structures. By applying an EUV burst detection algorithm, we found
that 96% of the events could be classed as EUV bursts. None of the spike events
are} rendered invisible by the AIA processing pipeline, but the total intensity
over an event's lifetime can be reduced by up to 67%. Users are recommended to
always restore the original intensities to AIA data when studying short-lived
or rapidly evolving features that exhibit fine-scale structure.

Time-Delay Neural Network (MTDNN) architecture, called MSTRE-Net, which
processes the temporal information using multiple streams in parallel with
varying resolutions keeping the network more compact, and thus with a faster
inference and an improved recognition rate than having identical TDNN streams.
In addition, two novel preprocessing steps prior to training the acoustic model
are proposed. First, we suggest using recordings from both monophonic and
polyphonic domains during training the acoustic model. Second, we tag
monophonic and polyphonic recordings with distinct labels for discriminating
non-vocal silence and music instances during alignment. Moreover, we present a
new test set with a considerably larger size and a higher musical variability
compared to the existing datasets used in ALT literature, while maintaining the

superconducting circuits, trapped ions, and nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond

micromagnet-induced gradient field and a tunable two-qubit coupling. We
identify the condition of qubit rotation speed and coupling strength where we
robustly achieve high-fidelity gates. We realize Deutsch-Jozsa and Grover

generated; this mesh contains a low number of irregular vertices but these are
not necessarily aligned, causing a very dense quad layout. A T-mesh is built on
the mesh which allows to modify its topology by assigning new integer lengths

highly entangled five-qubit Brown \emph{et al.} state and the six-qubit Borras

cases. Furthermore, we study the effects of six noise models, namely bit-flip
noise, phase-flip noise, bit-phase flip noise, amplitude damping, phase damping
and the depolarizing error that may affect the communication channel used for
the teleportation. An investigation on the variation of the initial state's
fidelity with respect to the teleported state in the presence of the noise
model is performed. A visual representation of the variation of fidelity for
various values of the noise parameter $\eta$ is done through a graph plot. It
is observed that as the value of noise parameter in the range $\eta \in

decreases in the case of amplitude damping, phase damping and depolarizing

computed exactly with the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz (TBA). In some examples,
like the first $1/N$ correction to the free energy in the non-linear sigma

historical spending peak. We consider the concave envelope of the utility with
respect to consumption, allowing us to focus on an auxiliary HJB variational
inequality on the strength of concavification principle and dynamic programming
arguments. By applying the dual transform and smooth-fit conditions, the
auxiliary HJB variational inequality is solved in closed-form piecewisely and
some thresholds of the wealth variable are obtained. The optimal consumption
and investment control can be derived in the piecewise feedback form. The
rigorous verification proofs on optimality and concavification principle are
provided. Some numerical sensitivity analysis and financial implications are
also presented.

the gamma rays predominantly scatter off recombination-line photons from clouds

cascade spectrum is rather insensitive to the injection of hard electron
spectra associated with the short-time variability of blazars. Adopting
physical parameters representative of Markarian 501 and 3C 279, respectively,
we numerically obtain spectral energy distributions showing distinct features
imprinted by the recombination-line photons. The hints for a peculiar feature
at ~3 TeV in the spectrum of Markarian 501, detected with the MAGIC telescopes
during a strong X-ray flux activity in 2014 July, can be explained in this
scenario as a result of the up-scattering of line photons by beam electrons and
the low pair-creation optical depth. Inspecting a high-fidelity Fermi-LAT
spectrum of 3C 279 from January 2018 reveals troughs in the spectrum that
coincide with the threshold energies for gamma rays producing pairs in
collisions with recombination-line photons, and the absence of exponential

roughness of real surfaces typically exists over many length scales. This
investigation aims to determine which scales of topography have the strongest
effect on macroscopic adhesion. Adhesion measurements were performed on
technology-relevant diamond coatings of varying roughness using spherical ruby
probes that are large enough ($0.5$-mm-diameter) to sample all length scales of
topography. For each material, more than $2000$ measurements of pull-off force
were performed in order to investigate the magnitude and statistical
distribution of adhesion. Using sphere-contact models, the roughness-dependent
effective values of work of adhesion were measured, ranging from $0.08$ to
$7.15$ mJ/m$^2$ across the four surfaces. The data was more accurately fit
using numerical analysis, where an interaction potential was integrated over
the AFM-measured topography of all contacting surfaces. These calculations
revealed that consideration of nanometer-scale plasticity in the materials was
crucial for a good quantitative fit of the measurements, and the presence of
such plasticity was confirmed with AFM measurements of the probe after testing.
This analysis enabled the extraction of geometry-independent material
parameters; the intrinsic work of adhesion between ruby and diamond was
determined to be $46.3$ mJ/m$^2$. The range of adhesion was $5.6$ nm, which is
longer than is typically assumed for atomic interactions, but is in agreement
with other recent investigations. Finally, the numerical analysis was repeated
for the same surfaces but this time with different length-scales of roughness
included or filtered out. The results demonstrate a critical band of
length-scales between $43$ nm and $1.8$ nm in lateral size that has the
strongest effect on the total adhesive force for these hard, rough contacts.

learning approaches for lesion detection and classification on whole-slide

classification from the convolutional neural networks (CNN) are demonstrated in
this study to provide comprehensive interpretability for the proposed CAD
system using pathological knowledge. Methods: In the experiment, a total of 186
slides of WSIs were collected and classified into three categories:
Non-Carcinoma, Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS), and Invasive Ductal Carcinoma
(IDC). Instead of conducting pixel-wise classification into three classes
directly, we designed a hierarchical framework with the multi-view scheme that
performs lesion detection for region proposal at higher magnification first and
then conducts lesion classification at lower magnification for each detected
lesion. Results: The slide-level accuracy rate for three-category
classification reaches 90.8% (99/109) through 5-fold cross-validation and
achieves 94.8% (73/77) on the testing set. The experimental results show that
the morphological characteristics and co-occurrence properties learned by the
deep learning models for lesion classification are accordant with the clinical
rules in diagnosis. Conclusion: The pathological interpretability of the deep
features not only enhances the reliability of the proposed CAD system to gain
acceptance from medical specialists, but also facilitates the development of
deep learning frameworks for various tasks in pathology. Significance: This
paper presents a CAD system for pathological image analysis, which fills the
clinical requirements and can be accepted by medical specialists with providing
its interpretability from the pathological perspective.

Reconciling these two forms of communication is desirable for generating

while maintaining end-to-end differentiability. Some existing approaches (such

discrete approximations in the zero-temperature limit, while others (such as
sparsemax transformations and the Hard Concrete distribution) produce
discrete/continuous hybrids. In this paper, we build rigorous theoretical

starting point is a new ""direct sum"" base measure defined on the face lattice
of the probability simplex. From this measure, we introduce new entropy and
Kullback-Leibler divergence functions that subsume the discrete and
differential cases and have interpretations in terms of code optimality. Our
framework suggests two strategies for representing and sampling mixed random

Adaptive Normalized Representation Learning (ANRL) framework is devised, which
adaptively selects feature normalization methods according to the inputs,
aiming to learn domain-agnostic and discriminative representation. Moreover, to
facilitate the representation learning, Dual Calibration Constraints are
designed, including Inter-Domain Compatible loss and Inter-Class Separable

power-efficient implementation in real-world SNN hardware, and 3) we report the
SNN energy consumption per classification, clearly demonstrating the real-world
feasibility and power savings induced by SNN-based radar processing. We release
evaluation code to help future research.

by space-based photometry missions allowed to directly determine their internal
rotation. These constraints have pointed towards the existence of angular
momentum transport processes unaccounted for in theoretical models.
Constraining the properties of their internal rotation thus appears as the
golden path to determine the physical nature of these missing dynamical
processes. We wish to determine the robustness of a new approach to study the
internal rotation of post main-sequence stars, using parametric rotation
profiles coupled to a global optimization technique. We test our methodology on
Kepler 56, a red giant observed by the Kepler mission. First, we carry out an
extensive modelling of the star using global and local minimizations
techniques, and seismic inversions. Then, using our best model, we study in
details its internal rotation profile, we adopted a Bayesian approach to
constrain stellar parametric predetermined rotation profiles using a Monte
Carlo Markov Chain analysis of the rotational splittings of mixed modes. Our
Monte Carlo Markov Chain analysis of the rotational splittings allows to
determine the core and envelope rotation of Kepler 56 as well as give hints
about the location of the transition between the slowly rotating envelope and
the fast rotating core. We are able to discard a rigid rotation profile in the
radiative regions followed by a power-law in the convective zone and show that
the data favours a transition located in the radiative region, as predicted by
processes originating from a turbulent nature. Our analysis of Kepler 56
indicates that turbulent processes whose transport efficiency is reduced by
chemical gradients are favoured, while large scale fossil magnetic fields are
disfavoured as a solution to the missing angular momentum transport.

resources to adhere to cost and power limitations of their carrying system.
Deploying deep neural networks on resource-constrained hardware became possible
with model compression techniques, as well as efficient and hardware-aware
architecture design. However, model adaptation is additionally required due to
the diverse operation environments. In this work, we address the problem of
training deep neural networks on resource-constrained hardware in the context
of visual domain adaptation. We select the task of monocular depth estimation
where our goal is to transform a pre-trained model to the target's domain data.
While the source domain includes labels, we assume an unlabelled target domain,
as it happens in real-world applications. Then, we present an adversarial
learning approach that is adapted for training on the device with limited
resources. Since visual domain adaptation, i.e. neural network training, has
not been previously explored for resource-constrained hardware, we present the
first feasibility study for image-based depth estimation. Our experiments show
that visual domain adaptation is relevant only for efficient network
architectures and training sets at the order of a few hundred samples. Models
and code are publicly available.

$P_c$ states and $P_{cs}(4459)$, fit the spectrum well. The success in
describing the pattern of heavy-antiheavy hadronic molecules stimulates us to
give more predictions for the heavy-heavy cases, which are less discussed in

from the dominant constant interaction from resonance saturation, we find that
the existence of many heavy-heavy hadronic molecules is natural. Among these

honeycomb antiferromagnet GdInO3 polycrystalline. No long-range magnetic
ordering was observed with only a sharp upturn in the temperature dependent
magnetization curves at TN ~ 2.1 K. The large value of frustration index value
~ 5.0 suggests short-range antiferromagnetic interactions existing between the
Gd3+ moments in this frustrated magnetic system. Negligible thermal and
magnetic hysteresis suggest a second-order feature of phase transition and a
reversible magnetocaloric effect (MCE) in GdInO3 compound. In the magnetic
field changes of 0-50 kOe and 0-70 kOe, the maximum magnetic entropy change
values are 9.31 J/kg K and 17.53 J/kg K near the liquid helium temperature,
with the corresponding RCP values of 106.61 and 196.38 J/kg, respectively. The
relative lower MCE performance of GdInO3 polycrystalline than the other
Gd-based magnetocaloric effect is understood by the high magnetic frustration
in this system. Our investigation results reveal GdInO3 polycrystalline has a
large reversible MCE, which not only provides another possibility of exploiting
magnetocaloric refrigerants in the frustrated magnetic systems near the
cryogenic temperature region, but also serves to excavate more exotic
properties in the frustrated stuffed honeycomb magnetic systems.

hand, estimates with triangulation-based techniques are prone to large bias and
variance at low imaging depths due to limited angle for left and right

beamforming approach is proposed and evaluated in this paper. The hypothesis
behind the proposed approach is that the peripheral flows are transverse in
nature, where directional beamforming can be employed without the need of an
angle estimator and the deeper flows being non-transverse and directional,
triangulation-based vector flow imaging can be employed. In the simulation
study, an overall 67.62% and 74.71% reduction in magnitude bias along with a
slight reduction in the standard deviation are observed with the proposed
fusion beamforming approach when compared to triangulation-based beamforming

conventional DAS technique offers poor contrast, low imaging resolution, and
limited spatiotemporal sensitivity. This article attempts to improve the
spatiotemporal sensitivity of conventional flow imaging with a novel multiply
and sum based nonlinear high-resolution (NLHR) beamforming approach. The major
advantages of the proposed beamformer are the harmonic generation and the
enhanced coherence in beamformed signals that improve the spatiotemporal
sensitivity towards flow transients. We demonstrate the proposed beamformer for
a directional cross-correlation as well as an autocorrelation based velocity
estimator with simulated parabolic flow profiles of different velocities and
flow directions, an in-vitro rotating disk dataset, and pulsatile flow
experiments. The sensitivity of NLHR beamforming towards the flow transients is
validated in-vitro with a sudden reversal of flow direction and air bubble
tracking experiments. The comparison between the time-frequency plots of DAS
and NLHR beamforming indicates that the impulsive spatiotemporal changes
induced by the flow of air bubbles are clearly characterized by nonlinear
beamforming than that of DAS beamforming. Furthermore, better spatiotemporal
velocity tracking of a single air bubble and a clear distinguishability between
the tracking of two proximal air bubbles are observed in-vitro. Preliminary
studies on the in-vivo carotid data also show comparable, if not better,
results than that of the DAS algorithm. Detailed results for each test case in

classify an input image as one of a set of predefined classes. An approach to
software testing that alleviates the oracle problem is metamorphic testing
(MT). While traditional software testing examines the correctness of individual
test cases, MT instead examines the relations amongst multiple executions of
test cases and their outputs. These relations are called metamorphic relations
(MRs): if an MR is found to be violated, then a fault must exist in the SUT.
This paper examines the problem of classifying images containing visually
hidden markers called Artcodes, and applies MT to verify and enhance the
trained classifiers. This paper further examines two MRs, Separation and
Occlusion, and reports on their capability in verifying the image
classification using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in conjunction with
three other statistical analysis methods: t-test (for unequal variances),
Kruskal-Wallis test, and Dunnett's test. In addition to our previously-studied
classifier, that used Random Forests, we introduce a new classifier that uses a
support vector machine, and present its MR-augmented version. Experimental
evaluations across a number of performance metrics show that the augmented
classifiers can achieve better performance than non-augmented classifiers. This
paper also analyses how the enhanced performance is obtained.

discovered, some of them are lost before their orbit can be firmly established
to ensure long-term recovery. A fraction of these present non-negligible
chances of impact with the Earth. We present a method of targeted observations
that allowed us to eliminate that risk by obtaining deep images of the area
where the object would be, should it be on a collision orbit. 2006 QV89 was one
of these objects, with a chance of impact with the Earth on 2019 September 9.
Its position uncertainty (of the order of 1 degree) and faintness (below
V$\sim$24) made it a difficult candidate for a traditional direct recovery.
However, the position of the virtual impactors could be determined with
excellent accuracy. In July 2019, the virtual impactors of 2006 QV89 were
particularly well placed, with a very small uncertainty region, and an expected
magnitude of V$<$26. The area was imaged using ESO's Very Large Telescope, in
the context of the ESA/ESO collaboration on Near-Earth Objects, resulting in
very constraining a non-detection. This resulted in the elimination of the
virtual impactor, even without effectively recovering 2006 QV89, indicating
that it did not represent a threat. This method of deep non-detection of
virtual impactors demonstrated a large potential to eliminate the threat of
other-wise difficult to recover near-Earth objects

off. Among these approaches, contrastive learning has seen tremendous progress
and led to state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we construct a novel
probabilistic graphical model that effectively incorporates the low rank
promoting prior into the framework of contrastive learning, referred to as
LORAC. In contrast to the existing conventional self-supervised approaches that
only considers independent learning, our hypothesis explicitly requires that
all the samples belonging to the same instance class lie on the same subspace
with small dimension. This heuristic poses particular joint learning
constraints to reduce the degree of freedom of the problem during the search of
the optimal network parameterization. Most importantly, we argue that the low
rank prior employed here is not unique, and many different priors can be
invoked in a similar probabilistic way, corresponding to different hypotheses
about underlying truth behind the contrastive features. Empirical evidences
show that the proposed algorithm clearly surpasses the state-of-the-art
approaches on multiple benchmarks, including image classification, object
detection, instance segmentation and keypoint detection.

rocks and its effects on pore-scale flow in terms of numerical modeling, since
massive samples are usually required to handle intrinsic uncertainties. Despite
remarkable advances achieved by traditional process-based methods, statistical
approaches and recently famous deep learning-based models, few works have
focused on producing several kinds of rocks with one trained model and allowing
the reconstructed samples to satisfy certain given properties, such as
porosity. To fill this gap, we propose a new framework, named RockGPT, which is
composed of VQ-VAE and conditional GPT, to synthesize 3D samples based on a
single 2D slice from the perspective of video generation. The VQ-VAE is
utilized to compress high-dimensional input video, i.e., the sequence of
continuous rock slices, to discrete latent codes and reconstruct them. In order
to obtain diverse reconstructions, the discrete latent codes are modeled using
conditional GPT in an autoregressive manner, while incorporating conditional
information from a given slice, rock type, and porosity. We conduct two
experiments on five kinds of rocks, and the results demonstrate that RockGPT
can produce different kinds of rocks with the same model, and the reconstructed
samples can successfully meet certain specified porosities. In a broader sense,
through leveraging the proposed conditioning scheme, RockGPT constitutes an
effective way to build a general model to produce multiple kinds of rocks
simultaneously that also satisfy user-defined properties.

perform simple exclusion on $\Lambda$, but when they occupy neighboring sites
they feel a binding energy $-U_1<0$ in the horizontal direction and $-U_2<0$ in
the vertical one. Thus the Kawasaki dynamics is conservative inside the volume
$\Lambda$. Along each bond touching the boundary of $\Lambda$ from the outside
to the inside, particles are created with rate $\rho=e^{-\Delta\beta}$, while
along each bond from the inside to the outside, particles are annihilated with
rate $1$, where $\beta>0$ is the inverse temperature and $\Delta>0$ is an
activity parameter. Thus, the boundary of $\Lambda$ plays the role of an
infinite gas reservoir with density $\rho$. We consider the parameter regime
$U_1>2U_2$ also known as the strongly anisotropic regime. We take
$\Delta\in{(U_1,U_1+U_2)}$, so that the empty (respectively full) configuration
is a metastable (respectively stable) configuration. We investigate how the
transition from empty to full takes place with particular attention to the
critical configurations that asymptotically have to be crossed with probability
1. The derivation of some geometrical properties of the saddles allows us to
identify the full geometry of the minimal gates and their boundaries for the
nucleation in the strongly anisotropic case. We observe very different
behaviors for this case with respect to the isotropic ($U_1=U_2$) and weakly
anisotropic ($U_1<2U_2$) ones. Moreover, we derive mixing time, spectral gap

drastic changes in our ecosystems in addition to financial losses caused by the
depletion of natural resources. The Fisheries and Aquatic Department (FAD) of
the United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) issued a report

pursuer-evader problem that is tackled within an ML framework. One or more
pursuers, such as law enforcement vessels, intercept an evader (i.e., the
illegal fishing ship) using an online reinforcement learning mechanism that is
based on a value iteration process. It employs real-time navigation
measurements of the evader ship as well as those of the pursuing vessels and
returns back model-free interception strategies.

certainly not true for every application, in some applications, especially in
economics, social science, healthcare industry, and administrative decision
making, scientists or practitioners are resistant to use predictions made by a

study can be to make discoveries based upon the prediction function, e.g., to
reveal the relationships between measurements. Another reason can be that the
training dataset is not large enough to make researchers feel completely sure
about a purely data-driven result. Being able to examine and interpret the

statistical models are much more explainable, their accuracy often falls
considerably below DNN. In this paper, we propose an approach to fill the gap

the various features is presented. This allows interpreting the model,
identifying some learned physical properties, explaining individual

  Energy Use in Batteryless Systems",,,,,"cs.DC cs.AR cs.LG cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Sensing systems powered by energy harvesting have traditionally been designed
to tolerate long periods without energy. As the Internet of Things (IoT)
evolves towards a more transient and opportunistic execution paradigm, reducing
energy storage costs will be key for its economic and ecologic viability.
However, decreasing energy storage in harvesting systems introduces reliability
issues. Transducers only produce intermittent energy at low voltage and current
levels, making guaranteed task completion a challenge. Existing ad hoc methods
overcome this by buffering enough energy either for single tasks, incurring
large data-retention overheads, or for one full application cycle, requiring a
large energy buffer. We present Julienning: an automated method for optimizing
the total energy cost of batteryless applications. Using a custom specification
model, developers can describe transient applications as a set of atomically
executed kernels with explicit data dependencies. Our optimization flow can
partition data- and energy-intensive applications into multiple execution
cycles with bounded energy consumption. By leveraging interkernel data
dependencies, these energy-bounded execution cycles minimize the number of
system activations and nonvolatile data transfers, and thus the total energy
overhead. We validate our methodology with two batteryless cameras running
energy-intensive machine learning applications. Results demonstrate that
compared to ad hoc solutions, our method can reduce the required energy storage
by over 94% while only incurring a 0.12% energy overhead.

constraint under the $l_{2}$ norm is useful for provable adversarial
robustness, interpretable gradients and stable training. While $1$-Lipschitz
CNNs can be designed by enforcing a $1$-Lipschitz constraint on each layer,
training such networks requires each layer to have an orthogonal Jacobian
matrix (for all inputs) to prevent the gradients from vanishing during
backpropagation. A layer with this property is said to be Gradient Norm
Preserving (GNP). In this work, we introduce a procedure to certify the
robustness of $1$-Lipschitz CNNs by relaxing the orthogonalization of the last
linear layer of the network that significantly advances the state of the art
for both standard and provable robust accuracies on CIFAR-100 (gains of
$4.80\%$ and $4.71\%$, respectively). We further boost their robustness by
introducing (i) a novel Gradient Norm preserving activation function called the
Householder activation function (that includes every $\mathrm{GroupSort}$
activation) and (ii) a certificate regularization. On CIFAR-10, we achieve
significant improvements over prior works in provable robust accuracy
($5.81\%$) with only a minor drop in standard accuracy ($-0.29\%$). Code for

derived from electronic health records in order to model risk for progression

  Materials and Methods: We searched for articles published between January 1,
2010, and May 31, 2020, in PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, IEEE Explore Digital
Library, Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, and arXiv. We
used predefined criteria to select relevant articles and summarized them
according to key components of ML analysis such as data characteristics,
computational algorithms, and research focus.
  Results: There has been a considerable rise over the past 5 years in the
number of research papers using ML-based analysis for AD dementia modeling. We
reviewed 64 relevant articles in our SLR. The results suggest that majority of
existing research has focused on predicting progression of AD dementia using
publicly available datasets containing both neuroimaging and clinical data
(neurobehavioral status exam scores, patient demographics, neuroimaging data,
and laboratory test values).
  Discussion: Identifying individuals at risk for progression of AD dementia
could potentially help to personalize disease management to plan future care.
Clinical data consisting of both structured data tables and clinical notes can
be effectively used in ML-based approaches to model risk for AD dementia
progression. Data sharing and reproducibility of results can enhance the

It is shown that if the surface susceptibilities of a given metasurface are

$\boldsymbol{k_{||}}$ with complex coefficients, they can be conveniently
expressed as spatial derivatives of the difference and average fields around
the metasurface in the space domain, leading to extended forms of the standard
Generalized Sheet Transition Conditions (GSTCs) accounting for the spatial

all-dielectric cylindrical puck unit cells, which exhibit purely tangential

characteristics, the proposed concept is numerically confirmed in 2D. A single
Lorentzian has been found to describe the spatio-temporal frequency behavior of

governance has been extensively theorized, the role of workers has received
comparatively little attention. This chapter looks at the role that workers
play in identifying and mitigating harms from AI technologies. Harms are the
causally assessed impacts of technologies. They arise despite technical
reliability and are not a result of technical negligence but rather of
normative uncertainty around questions of safety and fairness in complex social
systems. There is high consensus in the AI ethics community on the benefits of
reducing harms but less consensus on mechanisms for determining or addressing
harms. This lack of consensus has resulted in a number of collective actions by
workers protesting how harms are identified and addressed in their workplace.
We theorize the role of workers within AI governance and construct a model of
harm reporting processes in AI workplaces. The harm reporting process involves
three steps, identification, the governance decision, and the response. Workers
draw upon three types of claims to argue for jurisdiction over questions of AI
governance, subjection, control over the product of labor, and proximate
knowledge of systems. Examining the past decade of AI related worker activism
allows us to understand how different types of workers are positioned within a
workplace that produces AI systems, how their position informs their claims,
and the place of collective action in staking their claims. This chapter argues
that workers occupy a unique role in identifying and mitigating harms caused by
AI systems.

feasible to write $\boldsymbol{B}(\boldsymbol{r})$ as the circular loop
magnetic field contribution plus a sum of powers of $H/R$. Analytic formulas
for the magnetic field are obtained from truncated finite expansions outside
the neighborhood of the wire. These showed to be computationally less expensive

there had been any warning signs that could have allowed them to intervene
sooner. Machine learning can predict which students are at risk of failing a
high-stakes certification exam. If predictions can be made well in advance of
the exam, then educators can meaningfully intervene before students take the
exam to reduce the chances of a failing score.
  Methods: Using already-collected, first-year student assessment data from
five cohorts in a Master of Physician Assistant Studies program, the authors
implement an ""adaptive minimum match"" version of the k-nearest neighbors
algorithm (AMMKNN), using changing numbers of neighbors to predict each
student's future exam scores on the Physician Assistant National Certifying
Examination (PANCE). Validation occurred in two ways: Leave-one-out
cross-validation (LOOCV) and evaluating the predictions in a new cohort.
  Results: AMMKNN achieved an accuracy of 93% in LOOCV. AMMKNN generates a
predicted PANCE score for each student, one year before they are scheduled to
take the exam. Students can then be classified into extra support, optional
extra support, or no extra support groups. The educator then has one year to
provide the appropriate customized support to each category of student.
  Conclusions: Predictive analytics can identify at-risk students, so they can
receive additional support or remediation when preparing for high-stakes
certification exams. Educators can use the included methods and code to
generate predicted test outcomes for students. The authors recommend that
educators use this or similar predictive methods responsibly and transparently,
as one of many tools used to support students.

wall-bounded side-wall heated cavity. As URANS and hybrid RANS-LES models fail
to produce modeled energy due to laminarization, the alternative is LES applied
on the coarse mesh. In a quantitative manner, first and second-moment
statistics are com-pared against both reference LES and experimental databases
from literature. For first moment statistics, both models globally predict the
flow field well. However, for higher moments, the dynamic model outperforms the
standard Smagorinsky model using the same mesh resolution. In a qualitative
fashion, we report the contours of both temperature and velocity fields as well
as the near-wall turbulent coherent structures. Results of flow quantities are
globally in very good agreement with both reference LES and experimental
measurements at a fraction of the CPU power needed for conventional LES.
