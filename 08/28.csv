signals together with numerous signals of moderate strength promise stringent

the required number of physical qubits to achieve a quantum advantage in the
fault tolerant regime. Within a particular time frame, both the code cycle time
and the number of achievable physical qubits may vary by orders of magnitude
between different quantum hardware designs. We start with logical resource
requirements corresponding to a quantum advantage for a particular chemistry
application, simulating the FeMoco molecule, and explore to what extent slower
code cycle times can be mitigated by using additional qubits. We show that in
certain situations architectures with considerably slower code cycle times will
still be able to reach desirable run times, provided enough physical qubits are
available. We utilize various space and time optimization strategies that have
been previously considered within the field of error-correcting surface codes.
In particular, we compare two distinct methods of parallelization, Game of
Surface Code's Units, and AutoCCZ factories, both of which enable one to
incrementally speed up the computation until the reaction limited rate is
reached. Finally we calculate the number of physical qubits which would be
required to break the 256 bit elliptic curve encryption of keys in the Bitcoin
network, within the small available time frame in which it would actually pose
a threat to do so. It would require approximately 317 million physical qubits
to break the encryption within one hour using the surface code, a code cycle
time of 1 $ \mu s$, a reaction time of 10 $ \mu s$, and physical gate error of
$10^{-3}$. To break the encryption instead within one day it would require 13
million physical qubits.

than a straightforward generalization of the Hermitian cases. Even for
one-dimensional tight-binding models with nonreciprocal hopping, the appearance
of point gaps and the skin effect leads to the breakdown of the usual
bulk-boundary correspondence. Luckily, the correspondence can be resurrected by
introducing a winding number for the generalized Brillouin zone for systems
with even number of bands and chiral symmetry. Here, we analyze the topological
phases of a nonreciprocal hopping model on the stub lattice, where one of the
three bands remains flat. Due to the lack of chiral symmetry, the biorthogonal
Zak phase is no longer quantized, invalidating the winding number as a
topological index. Instead, we show that a $Z_2$ invariant can be defined from
Majorana's stellar representation of the eigenstates on the Bloch sphere. The
parity of the total azimuthal winding of the entire Majorana constellation
correctly predicts the appearance of edge states between the bulk gaps. We
further show that the system is not a square-root topological insulator,
despite the fact that its parent Hamiltonian can be block diagonalized and
related to a sawtooth lattice model. The analysis presented here may be
generalized to understand other non-Hermitian systems with multiple bands.

in the world of machine learning. While PCA is often thought of as a
dimensionality reduction method, the purpose of PCA is actually two-fold:
dimension reduction and uncorrelated feature learning. Furthermore, the
enormity of the dimensions and sample size in the modern day datasets have
rendered the centralized PCA solutions unusable. In that vein, this paper
reconsiders the problem of PCA when data samples are distributed across nodes
in an arbitrarily connected network. While a few solutions for distributed PCA
exist, those either overlook the uncorrelated feature learning aspect of the
PCA, tend to have high communication overhead that makes them inefficient
and/or lack `exact' or `global' convergence guarantees. To overcome these
aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a distributed PCA algorithm termed
FAST-PCA (Fast and exAct diSTributed PCA). The proposed algorithm is efficient
in terms of communication and is proven to converge linearly and exactly to the
principal components, leading to dimension reduction as well as uncorrelated
features. The claims are further supported by experimental results.

framework is proposed. The detection phase is performed by converting LiDAR
streams to computationally tractable depth images, and then, a deep neural
network is developed to identify pedestrian candidates both in RGB and depth
images. To provide accurate information, the detection phase is further
enhanced by fusing multi-modal sensor information using the Kalman filter. The
tracking phase is a combination of the Kalman filter prediction and an optical
flow algorithm to track multiple pedestrians in a scene. We evaluate our
framework on a real public driving dataset. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves significant performance improvement over a
baseline method that solely uses image-based pedestrian detection.

a protocol that makes optimal use of a given finite-size simulator by directly
preparing, on its bulk region, a mixed state representing the reduced density
operator of the translation-invariant infinite-sized system of interest. This
protocol is based on coherent evolution with a local deformation of the system

illustrate and explain the underlying physics, which consists of quasi-particle
transport towards the system's boundaries while retaining the bulk ""vacuum"".
For the example of a non-integrable extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we
demonstrate that our protocol enables a more accurate study of QPTs. In

\approx 0.27-0.42$. There is a strong correlation between the disk-jet geometry
and the dimensionless magnetic flux, resulting in prograde systems displaying
thinner equatorial accretion flows near the black hole and wider jets, compared
to retrograde systems. Prograde and retrograde MADs also exhibit different
trends in disk variability: accretion rate variability increases with
increasing spin for $a_*>0$ and remains almost constant for $a_*\lesssim 0$,
while magnetic flux variability shows the opposite trend. Jets in the MAD state
remove more angular momentum from black holes than is accreted, effectively
spinning down the black hole. If powerful jets from MAD systems in Nature are
persistent, this loss of angular momentum will notably reduce the black hole
spin over cosmic time.

The existing approaches focus on modeling the context from the perspective of

Despite impressive, these methods weaken the significance of the pixel
representations of the same category, i.e., the semantic-level contextual

representations by aggregating the image-level and semantic-level contextual
information, respectively. First, an image-level context module is designed to
capture the contextual information for each pixel in the whole image. Second,
we aggregate the representations of the same category for each pixel where the
category regions are learned under the supervision of the ground-truth
segmentation. Third, we compute the similarities between each pixel
representation and the image-level contextual information, the semantic-level
contextual information, respectively. At last, a pixel representation is
augmented by weighted aggregating both the image-level contextual information
and the semantic-level contextual information with the similarities as the
weights. Integrating the image-level and semantic-level context allows this

a wide range of proposals to mitigate their performance shortcomings. Despite
substantial throughput and energy efficiency achievements, most proposals only
bring modest (or marginal) gains in transaction commit latency. Consequently,
commit latencies in today's permissionless blockchain landscape remain
prohibitively high. This paper proposes NimbleChain, a novel algorithm that
extends permissionless blockchains based on Nakamoto consensus with a fast path
that delivers causal promises of commitment, or simply promises. Since promises
only partially order transactions, their latency is only a small fraction of
the totally-ordered commitment latency of Nakamoto consensus. Still, the weak
consistency guarantees of promises are strong enough to correctly implement
cryptocurrencies. To the best of our knowledge, NimbleChain is the first system
to bring together fast, partially-ordered transactions with consensus-based,
totally-ordered transactions in a permissionless setting. This hybrid
consistency model is able to speed up cryptocurrency transactions while still
supporting smart contracts, which typically have (strong) sequential
consistency needs. We implement NimbleChain as an extension of Ethereum and
evaluate it in a 500-node geo-distributed deployment. The results show
NimbleChain can promise a cryptocurrency transactions up to an order of

One of the most important use-cases is the quantum simulation of materials,

investigate a class of ansatze that incorporates knowledge of the quantum
hardware, namely the hardware efficient ansatze. The performance of hardware
efficient ansatze is affected differently by noise, and our goal is to study
the effect of noise on evaluating which ansatz gives more accurate results in
practice. First, we study the effect of noise on the different hardware
efficient ansatze by benchmarking and ranking the performance of each ansatz
family (i) on a chemistry application using VQE and (ii) by the recently
established metric of ""expressibility"". The results demonstrate the ranking of
optimal circuits does not remain constant in the presence of noise. Second, we
evaluate the suitability of the expressibility measure in this context by
performing a correlation study between expressibility and the performance of
the same circuits on a chemistry application using VQE. Our simulations reveal
a weak correlation and therefore demonstrate that expressibility is not an
adequate measure to quantify the effectiveness of parameterized quantum
circuits for quantum chemistry. Third, we evaluate the effect of different

quadratically with the channel transmittance, and, thus, this scheme is
unsuitable for long-distance transmission. This result was derived by using a
zero-error attack, which prevents the distribution of a secure key without
introducing any error. Here, we study various countermeasures to foil
zero-error attacks against COW-QKD. They require to either monitor some
additional available detection statistics, or to increase the number of quantum
states emitted. We obtain asymptotic upper security bounds on the secret key
rate that scale close to linear with the channel transmittance, thus suggesting
the effectiveness of the countermeasures to boost the performance of this

space. The flow is decomposed into low and high streamwise wavenumber groups,
the former of which is solved by considering the full nonlinear equations
whereas the latter is obtained from the linearised equations around the former.
The performance of the GQL approximation is subsequently compared with that of
a QL model (Thomas \emph{et al.}, \emph{Phys. Fluids.}, vol. 26, no. 10,
105112, 2014), in which the low-wavenumber group only contains zero streamwise
wavenumber. It is found that the QL model exhibits a considerably reduced
multi-scale behaviour at the given moderately high Reynolds number. This is
improved significantly by the GQL approximation which incorporates only a few
more streamwise Fourier modes into the low-wavenumber group, and it reasonably
well recovers the distance-from-the-wall scaling in the turbulence statistics
and spectra. Finally, it is proposed that the energy transfer from the low to
the high-wavenumber group in the GQL approximation, referred to as the
`scattering' mechanism, depends on the neutrally stable leading Lyapunov
spectrum of the linearised equations for the high wavenumber group. In
particular, it is shown that if the threshold wavenumber distinguishing the two
groups is sufficiently high, the scattering mechanism can completely be absent
due to the linear nature of the equations for the high-wavenumber group.

multiplicative layers obtained from the subsets of different scanning patterns.
The spatial redundancies in the multiplicative layers can be efficiently
removed by performing low-rank approximation at different ranks on the Krylov
subspace. The intra-view and inter-view redundancies between approximated
layers are further removed by HEVC encoding. Next, a Fourier disparity layer
representation is constructed from the first subset of the approximated light
field based on the chosen hierarchical order. Subsequent view subsets are
synthesized by modeling the Fourier disparity layers that iteratively refine
the representation with improved accuracy. The critical advantage of the
proposed hybrid layered representation and coding scheme is that it utilizes
not just spatial and temporal redundancies in light fields but efficiently
exploits intrinsic similarities among neighboring sub-aperture images in both
horizontal and vertical directions as specified by different predication
orders. In addition, the scheme is flexible to realize a range of multiple

midbrain dopaminergic system reflects prediction errors needed for learning in
reinforcement learning. Besides the well-documented association between
dopamine and reward processing, dopamine is implicated in a variety of
functions without a clear relationship to reward prediction error. Fluctuations
in dopamine levels influence the subjective perception of time, dopamine bursts
precede the generation of motor responses, and the dopaminergic system
innervates regions of the brain, including hippocampus and areas in prefrontal
cortex, whose function is not uniquely tied to reward. In this manuscript, we
propose that a common theme linking these functions is representation, and that
prediction errors signaled by the dopamine system, in addition to driving
associative learning, can also support the acquisition of adaptive state
representations. In a series of simulations, we show how this extension can
account for the role of dopamine in temporal and spatial representation, motor
response, and abstract categorization tasks. By extending the role of dopamine
signals to learning state representations, we resolve a critical challenge to
the Reward Prediction Error hypothesis of dopamine function.

extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw
during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply
changing the position representation method, though we find that current
methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a
simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases
(ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead,
it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to
their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model
on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of
length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding
model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11%
less memory. ALiBi's inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform
multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark.

interstellar molecules such as H$_2$, water, ammonia, and methanol. It has been
suggested that the so-called interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs) are
also formed on the interstellar grain icy surfaces by the combination of
radicals via reactions assumed to have an efficiency equal to unity. In this
work, we aim to investigate the robustness or weakness of this assumption by
considering the case of acetaldehyde (CH$_3$CHO) as a starting study case. In
the literature, it has been postulated that acetaldehyde is formed on the icy
surfaces via the combination of HCO and CH$_3$. Here we report new theoretical
computations on the efficiency of its formation.
  To this end, we coupled quantum chemical calculations of the energetics and
kinetics of the reaction CH$_3$ + HCO, which can lead to the formation of
CH$_3$CHO or CO + CH$_4$. Specifically, we combined reaction kinetics computed
with the Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) theory (tunneling included)
method with diffusion and desorption competitive channels. We provide the
results of our computations in the format used by astrochemical models to
facilitate their exploitation.
  Our new computations indicate that the efficiency of acetaldehyde formation
on the icy surfaces is a complex function of the temperature and, more
importantly, of the assumed diffusion over binding energy ratio $f$ of the
CH$_3$ radical. If the ratio $f$ is $\geq$0.4, the efficiency is equal to unity
in the range where the reaction can occur, namely between 12 and 30 K. However,
if $f$ is smaller, the efficiency dramatically crashes: with $f$=0.3, it is at
most 0.01. In addition, the formation of acetaldehyde is always in competition
with that of CO + CH$_4$.

field with exciting reports of long spin diffusion lengths and spin relaxation
times in organic semiconductors (OSCs). Easily processed and inexpensive, OSCs
are considered a potential alternative to inorganic materials for use in
spintronic applications. Spin currents have been detected in a wide range of
materials, however, there is still uncertainty over the origin of the signals.
Recently, we explored spin transport through an organic semiconductor with
lateral spin injection and detection architectures, where the injected spin
current is detected non-locally via spin-to-charge conversion in an inorganic
detector. In this work we show that the widely-used control experiments like
linear power dependence and inversion of the signal with the magnetic field are
not sufficient evidence of spin transport and can lead to an incorrect
interpretation of the signal. Here, we use in-plane angular dependent
measurements to separate pure spin signal from parasitic effects arising from
spin rectification (SREs). Apart from well established anisotropic
magnetoresistance (AMR) and anomalous Hall effect (AHE), we observed a novel
effect which we call spurious inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE). It strongly
resembles ISHE behaviour, but arises in the ferromagnet rather than the
detector meaning this additional effect has to be considered in future work.

include spectropolarimetric instruments designed to measure the photospheric
magnetic field. SDO's Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) emphasizes
full-disk high-cadence and good spatial resolution data acquisition while
Hinode's Solar Optical Telescope Spectro-Polarimeter (SOT-SP) focuses on high
spatial resolution and spectral sampling at the cost of a limited field of view
and slower temporal cadence. This work introduces a deep-learning system named
SynthIA (Synthetic Inversion Approximation), that can enhance both missions by
capturing the best of each instrument's characteristics. We use SynthIA to
produce a new magnetogram data product, SynodeP (Synthetic Hinode Pipeline),
that mimics magnetograms from the higher spectral resolution Hinode/SOT-SP
pipeline, but is derived from full-disk, high-cadence, and lower
spectral-resolution SDO/HMI Stokes observations. Results on held-out data show
that SynodeP has good agreement with the Hinode/SOT-SP pipeline inversions,
including magnetic fill fraction, which is not provided by the current SDO/HMI
pipeline. SynodeP further shows a reduction in the magnitude of the 24-hour
oscillations present in the SDO/HMI data. To demonstrate SynthIA's generality,
we show the use of SDO/AIA data and subsets of the HMI data as inputs, which
enables trade-offs between fidelity to the Hinode/SOT-SP inversions, number of
observations used, and temporal artifacts. We discuss possible generalizations
of SynthIA and its implications for space weather modeling. This work is part
of the NASA Heliophysics DRIVE Science Center (SOLSTICE) at the University of
Michigan under grant NASA 80NSSC20K0600E, and will be open-sourced.

systems in the Ising universality class by qualitatively modifying the nature
of their critical points. We consider power-law decaying spin losses with a
Lindbladian spectrum closing at small momenta as $\propto q^\alpha$, with
$\alpha$ a positive tunable exponent directly related to the power-law decay of
the spatial profile of losses at long distances, $1/r^{(\alpha+d)}$. This
yields a class of soft modes asymptotically decoupled from dissipation at small
momenta, which are responsible for the emergence of a critical scaling regime
ascribable to the non-unitary counterpart of the universality class of
long-range interacting Ising models. For $\alpha<1$ we find a non-equilibrium
critical point ruled by a dynamical field theory described by a Langevin model
with coexisting inertial ($\sim {\partial^2_t}$) and frictional ($\sim
{\partial_t}$) kinetic coefficients, and driven by a gapless Markovian noise
with variance $\propto q^\alpha$ at small momenta. This effective field theory
is beyond the Halperin-Hohenberg description of dynamical criticality, and its
critical exponents differ from their unitary long-range counterparts. Our work
lays out perspectives for a revision of universality in driven-open systems by
employing dark states taylored by programmable dissipation.

implementation and deployment of deep learning inference for real-time
gravitational-wave data denoising and astrophysical source identification. This
is accomplished using a generic Inference-as-a-Service model that is capable of
adapting to the future needs of gravitational-wave data analysis. Our

challenges in peak-usage, scalability and reliability, and provide a data

achieved sub-millisecond scale latency will also be relevant for any machine

detected at ${\sim}10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The radio SED is consistent with
synchrotron emission from an outflow incident on an asymmetric medium. A

without corresponding broad H$\beta$ emission, suggesting high nuclear
extinction. We interpret this event as either a tidal disruption event or an
extreme flare of an active galactic nucleus, in both cases obscured by a dusty

importance of searches across all wave bands for assembling a sample of nuclear

galactocentric radius. The log(q) is lower for DIG compared to dense gas. The
median values of log(q) correlate best with stellar mass, and the most massive
galaxies show an increase in log(q) toward their galactic centers. The DIG
clearly shows higher $\Delta log[OI]/H\alpha$ values compared to the dense gas,

the strange quark stars by an equation of state based on the MIT Bag model. The
stellar models are based on an a priori assumed density dependence of the
magnetic field and thus anisotropy. Our study shows that not only the presence
of a strong magnetic field and anisotropy, but also the orientation of the
magnetic field itself, have an important influence on the physical properties
of stars. Two possible magnetic field orientations are considered, a radial
orientation, where the local magnetic fields point in the radial direction, and
a transverse orientation, where the local magnetic fields are perpendicular to
the radial direction. Interestingly, we find that for a transverse orientation
of the magnetic field, the stars become more massive with increasing anisotropy
and magnetic field strength and increase in size, since the repulsive,
effective anisotropic force increases in this case. In the case of a radially
orientated magnetic field, however, the masses and radii of the stars decrease
with increasing magnetic field strength, because of the decreasing effective
anisotropic force. Importantly, we also show that in order to achieve
hydrostatic equilibrium configurations of magnetized matter, it is essential to
account for both the local anisotropy effects as well as the anisotropy effects
caused by a strong magnetic field. Otherwise, hydrostatic equilibrium is not
achieved for magnetized stellar models.

between the gas-phase metallicity, stellar mass and star-formation rate (SFR).
It has been studied so far only for galaxies identified as star-forming (SF) on
the BPT diagrams (BPT-SF), but not for galaxies with LI(N)ER/AGN classification
(BPT-non-SF), mainly due to the lack of diagnostics for estimating their
gas-phase metallicities in the latter cases. We extend the FMR to BPT-non-SF
galaxies. To this end, we exploit the recent nebular line empirical
calibrations derived specifically for galaxies classified as non-SF in the BPT
diagrams. Moreover, we study an alternative representation of the FMR where we
consider the offsets in metallicity and SFR with respect to Main Sequence (MS)
galaxies. We find that galaxies with SFR higher than the MS are more metal-poor
than their counterparts on the MS, which is interpreted in terms of gas
accretion, boosting star formation and diluting the metallicity. Low-mass
galaxies below the MS (i.e. towards quiescence) have metallicities higher than
their MS counterparts, which is interpreted in terms of starvation, (i.e.
suppression of fresh gas supply) hampering star formation and reducing the
dilution effect, hence resulting in a higher level of internal chemical
enrichment. Massive galaxies below the MS have gas metallicity much closer to
their MS counterparts and much lower than expected from their stellar
metallicities; this result suggests a scenario where massive nearly-quiescent
galaxies with LI(N)ER-like nebular emission have recently accreted gas from the

emission in many low-metallicity star-forming galaxies. This emission requires
ionising photons with energy >54 eV, which are not produced in sufficient
amounts by normal stellar populations. To examine if high mass X-ray binaries
and ultra-luminous X-ray sources (HMXB/ULX) can explain the observed HeII
nebular emission and how their presence alters other emission lines, we compute
photoionisation models of galaxies including such sources. We combine spectral
energy distributions (SEDs) of integrated stellar populations with constrained
SEDs of ULXs to obtain composite spectra with varying amounts of X-ray
luminosity, parameterised by Lx/SFR. With these we compute photoionisation
models to predict the emission line fluxes of the optical recombination lines
of H and He+, and the main metal lines of OIII, OII, OI, and NII. The
predictions are then compared to a large sample of low-metallicity galaxies. We
find that it is possible to reproduce the nebular HeII and other line
observations with our spectra and with amounts of Lx/SFR compatible with the
observations. Our work suggests that HMBX/ULX could be responsible for the
observed nebular HeII emission. However, the strengths of the high and low
ionisation lines, such as HeII and OI, depend strongly on the X-ray
contribution and on the assumed SEDs of the high energy source(s); the latter
are poorly known.

Many of these lines are prominent and exhibit a distinctive broad and

investigate the potential and implications of these HFS split lines for
abundance analysis of cool stars. With standard spectral synthesis routines, as
provided by the spectroscopy software iSpec and the latest atomic data
(including HFS) available from the VALD3 database, we modeled these striking
line profiles. We used them to measure V abundances of cool dwarfs. We
determined V abundances for 135 early M dwarfs (M0.0V to M3.5V) in the CARMENES
guaranteed time observations sample. They exhibit a [V/Fe]-[Fe/H] trend
consistent with that derived from nearby FG dwarfs. The tight ($\pm$ 0.1 dex)
correlation between [V/H] and [Fe/H] suggests the potential application of V as
an alternative metallicity indicator in M dwarfs. We also show hints that
neglecting to model HFS could partially explain the temperature correlation in
V abundance measurements observed in previous studies of samples involving
dwarf stars with $T_{\rm eff} \lesssim 5300$K. Our work suggests that HFS can
impact certain absorption lines in cool photospheres more severely than in
Sun-like ones. Therefore, we advocate that HFS should be carefully treated in
abundance studies in stars cooler than $\sim 5000$K. On the other hand, strong
HFS split lines in high-resolution spectra present an opportunity for precision
chemical analyses of large samples of cool stars. The V-to-Fe trends exhibited
by the local M dwarfs continue to challenge theoretical models of V production
in the Galaxy.

complex as these systems are expected to execute large machine learning models.
To deal with the design complexity, a predictable design flow is needed to
guarantee real-time performance such as latency and throughput without
significantly increasing the buffer requirement of computing cores. Synchronous
Data Flow Graphs (SDFGs) are used for predictable mapping of streaming
applications to multiprocessor systems. We propose an SDFG-based design flow
for mapping spiking neural networks (SNNs) to many-core neuromorphic hardware
with the objective of exploring the tradeoff between throughput and buffer
size. The proposed design flow integrates an iterative partitioning approach,
based on Kernighan-Lin graph partitioning heuristic, creating SNN clusters such
that each cluster can be mapped to a core of the hardware. The partitioning
approach minimizes the inter-cluster spike communication, which improves
latency on the shared interconnect of the hardware. Next, the design flow maps
clusters to cores using an instance of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO),
an evolutionary algorithm, exploring the design space of throughput and buffer
size. Pareto optimal mappings are retained from the design flow, allowing
system designers to select a Pareto mapping that satisfies throughput and
buffer size requirements of the design. We evaluated the design flow using five
large-scale convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Results demonstrate 63%
higher maximum throughput and 10% lower buffer size requirement compared to
state-of-the-art dataflow-based mapping solutions.

However, they do not readily extend to heterogeneous data that are a
combination of numerical and categorical variables, e.g., arising from linked

generative models from high-dimensional heterogeneous data in an unsupervised
fashion. The learned generative model provides latent unified representations
that capture the factors common to the multiple dimensions of the data, and
thus enable fusing multimodal data for various machine learning tasks.
Following a Bayesian approach, we propose a general framework that combines
disparate data types through the natural parameterization of the exponential
family of distributions. To scale the model inference to millions of instances
with thousands of features, we use the Laplace-Bernstein approximation for
posterior computations involving nonlinear link functions. The proposed
algorithm is presented in detail for the commonly encountered heterogeneous
datasets with real-valued (Gaussian) and categorical (multinomial) features.
Experiments on two high-dimensional and heterogeneous datasets (NYC Taxi and

method to constrain \mfp at $z=6$ by using lower limits on the individual free
paths of ionisation around quasars. Lyman-limit absorbers with a density
sufficient to halt ionising photons produce strong absorption in the 6
lowest-energy Lyman transitions, in the absence of which a robust lower limit
can be placed on the individual free path. Applying this method to a set of
$26$ quasars at $5.5<z<6.5$, we find that $80\%$ of bright quasars
($M_{1450}<-26.5$) require individual free paths larger than $2$ pMpc. We model
the relation between opacity $\kappa$ and photo-ionisation rate $\Gamma$ via
the parameter $\xi$ such that $\kappa\propto\Gamma^{-\xi}$, and pose joint
limits on \mfp and $\xi$. For the nominal value of $\xi=2/3$, we constrain
$\lambda_{\text{mfp}}>0.31 \ (0.18)$ pMpc at $2\sigma \ (3\sigma)$: a much

  Methods: A novel patch-based Unsupervised Feature Loss (UFLoss) is proposed
and incorporated into the training of DL-based reconstruction frameworks in
order to preserve perceptual similarity and high-order statistics. The UFLoss
provides instance-level discrimination by mapping similar instances to similar
low-dimensional feature vectors and is trained without any human annotation. By
adding an additional loss function on the low-dimensional feature space during
training, the reconstruction frameworks from under-sampled or corrupted data
can reproduce more realistic images that are closer to the original with finer
textures, sharper edges, and improved overall image quality. The performance of
the proposed UFLoss is demonstrated on unrolled networks for accelerated 2D and
3D knee MRI reconstruction with retrospective under-sampling. Quantitative
metrics including NRMSE, SSIM, and our proposed UFLoss were used to evaluate
the performance of the proposed method and compare it with others.
  Results: In-vivo experiments indicate that adding the UFLoss encourages
sharper edges and more faithful contrasts compared to traditional and
learning-based methods with pure l2 loss. More detailed textures can be seen in
both 2D and 3D knee MR images. Quantitative results indicate that
reconstruction with UFLoss can provide comparable NRMSE and a higher SSIM while
achieving a much lower UFLoss value.
  Conclusion: We present UFLoss, a patch-based unsupervised learned feature
loss, which allows the training of DL-based reconstruction to obtain more
detailed texture, finer features, and sharper edges with higher overall image
quality under DL-based reconstruction frameworks.

rebuild software repeatedly, sometimes hundreds of times a day. To keep
rebuilds fast, build systems run incrementally, executing commands only when
built state cannot be reused. Existing tools like make present users with a
tradeoff. Simple build specifications are easy to write, but limit incremental
work. More complex build specifications produce faster incremental builds, but
writing them is labor-intensive and error-prone. This work shows that no such
tradeoff is necessary; build specifications can be both simple and fast.
  We introduce LaForge, a novel build tool that eliminates the need to specify
dependencies or incremental build steps. LaForge builds are easy to specify;
developers write a simple script that runs a full build. Even a single command
like gcc src/*.c will suffice. LaForge traces the execution of the build and
generates a transcript in the TraceIR language. On later builds, LaForge
evaluates the TraceIR transcript to detect changes and perform an efficient
incremental rebuild that automatically captures all build dependencies.
  We evaluate LaForge by building 14 software packages, including LLVM and

relationship (QSAR) modeling are two techniques used in drug discovery to find
small molecules that bind a protein target. Applying QSAR modeling to DEL data
can facilitate the selection of compounds for off-DNA synthesis and evaluation.
Such a combined approach has been shown recently by training binary classifiers
to learn DEL enrichments of aggregated ""disynthons"" to accommodate the sparse
and noisy nature of DEL data. However, a binary classifier cannot distinguish
between different levels of enrichment, and information is potentially lost
during disynthon aggregation. Here, we demonstrate a regression approach to
learning DEL enrichments of individual molecules using a custom negative
log-likelihood loss function that effectively denoises DEL data and introduces
opportunities for visualization of learned structure-activity relationships
(SAR). Our approach explicitly models the Poisson statistics of the sequencing
process used in the DEL experimental workflow under a frequentist view. We
illustrate this approach on a dataset of 108k compounds screened against CAIX,
and a dataset of 5.7M compounds screened against sEH and SIRT2. Due to the
treatment of uncertainty in the data through the negative log-likelihood loss
function, the models can ignore low-confidence outliers. While our approach
does not demonstrate a benefit for extrapolation to novel structures, we expect
our denoising and visualization pipeline to be useful in identifying SAR trends
and enriched pharmacophores in DEL data. Further, this approach to
uncertainty-aware regression is applicable to other sparse or noisy datasets
where the nature of stochasticity is known or can be modeled; in particular,
the Poisson enrichment ratio metric we use can apply to other settings that
compare sequencing count data between two experimental conditions.

against appending attacks. We then present a black-box source code-based
adversarial malware generation approach that can be used to evaluate the
robustness of malware detection models against real-world adversaries. The
proposed approach injects adversarial codes into the various locations of

sails in space, describes when a material is folded along straight crease line
segments while keeping the regions between the creases planar. Prior work has
found explicit equations for the folding angles of a flat-foldable degree-4
origami vertex and some cases of degree-6 vertices. We extend this work to
generalized symmetries of the degree-6 vertex where all sector angles equal
$60^\circ$. We enumerate the different viable rigid folding modes of these
degree-6 crease patterns and then use $2^{nd}$-order Taylor expansions and
prior rigid folding techniques to find algebraic folding angle relationships
between the creases. This allows us to explicitly compute the configuration
space of these degree-6 vertices, and in the process we uncover new
explanations for the effectiveness of Weierstrass substitutions in modeling
rigid origami. These results expand the toolbox of rigid origami mechanisms
that engineers and materials scientists may use in origami-inspired designs.

at global minima of the adiabatic potential energy surfaces, found by the

the ""immersion water flow"" technique on multidimensional energy grids, with
allowed the reflection and axial symmetry breaking. The influence of shell
effects on the energy dependence of the ratios of level-density parameters
corresponding to residues of the considered decay modes to those of neutron

ratio, the $a_{p}/a_{n}$ and $a_{\alpha}/a_{n}$ ratios do not show
characteristic maxima depending on the excitation energy of the compound
nucleus being formed. In the case of alpha decay, we identified the collective
enhancement caused by cluster degrees of freedom to play quite an important
role. The energetic course of the variability of the level density parameters
before reaching the asymptotic value, not taken into account so far, will be of
great importance for the estimation of the probabilities of de-excitation
cascades via light particles emission in competition with splitting and thus
for the determination of the survival probabilities and finally for the total

motivated by job allocation to servers in cloud computing applications. Jobs
arrive in an online manner, and need to be assigned to servers; their duration
and size are known at the time of arrival. There is an infinite supply of
identical servers, each having one unit of computational capacity per unit of
time. A server can be rented at any time and continues to be rented until all
jobs assigned to it finish. The cost of an assignment is the sum of durations
of rental periods of all servers. The goal is to assign jobs to servers to
minimize the overall cost while satisfying server capacity constraints. We
focus on analyzing two natural algorithms, NextFit and FirstFit, for the case
of jobs of equal duration. It is known that the competitive ratio of NextFit

generates a performance metric such as the run time without executing the

obviating the need to benchmark an enormous number of candidate

networks where each node represents a computational stage or operation.
Incorporating the inherent graph structure of these workloads in the

distant in the parameter space likely extract features in the same fashion,
just with trivial affine transformations between the latent spaces.
Furthermore, we show how applying a feature correlation loss, which
decorrelates the extracted features in a latent space, can reduce the
transferability of adversarial attacks between models, suggesting that the
models complete tasks in semantically different ways. Finally, we propose a
Dual Neck Autoencoder (DNA), which leverages this feature correlation loss to

devise a machine learning method, Gaussian mixture variational autoencoder
(GMVAE) that can simultaneously perform dimensionality reduction and clustering
of biomolecular conformations in an unsupervised way. We show that GMVAE can
learn a reduced representation of the free energy landscape of protein folding
with highly separated clusters that correspond to the metastable states during
folding. Since GMVAE uses a mixture of Gaussians as the prior, it can directly
acknowledge the multi-basin nature of protein folding free-energy landscape. To
make the model end-to-end differentialble, we use a Gumbel-softmax
distribution. We test the model on three long-timescale protein folding
trajectories and show that GMVAE embedding resembles the folding funnel with
folded states down the funnel and unfolded states outer in the funnel path.
Additionally, we show that the latent space of GMVAE can be used for kinetic
analysis and Markov state models built on this embedding produce folding and
unfolding timescales that are in close agreement with other rigorous dynamical
embeddings such as time independent component analysis (TICA).

popular, but also on how many of their voters actually turn out to vote. Here
we consider a simple model in which voters abstain from voting if they think
their vote would not matter. Specifically, they do not vote if they feel sure
their preferred candidate will win anyway (a condition we call complacency), or
if they feel sure their candidate will lose anyway (a condition we call
dejectedness). The voters reach these decisions based on a myopic assessment of
their local network, which they take as a proxy for the entire electorate:
voters know which candidate their neighbors prefer and they assume -- perhaps
incorrectly -- that those neighbors will turn out to vote, so they themselves
cast a vote if and only if it would produce a tie or a win for their preferred
candidate in their local neighborhood. We explore various network structures
and distributions of voter preferences and find that certain structures and
parameter regimes favor undemocratic outcomes where a minority faction wins,
especially when the locally preferred candidate is not representative of the
electorate as a whole.

the fully degenerate Richards equation. For showing global reliability, a
nonlocal-in-time error estimate is derived individually for the time-integrated
$H^1(H^{-1})$, $L^2(L^2)$, and the $L^2(H^1)$ errors. A maximum principle and a
degeneracy estimator are employed for the last one. Global and local space-time
efficiency error bounds are then obtained in a standard $H^1(H^{-1})\cap
L^2(H^1)$ norm. The reliability and efficiency norms employed coincide when
there is no nonlinearity. Moreover, error contributors such as flux
nonconformity, time discretization, quadrature, linearization, and data
oscillation are identified and separated. The estimates are also valid in a
setting where iterative linearization with inexact solvers is considered.
Numerical tests are conducted for nondegenerate and degenerate cases having
exact solutions, as well as for a realistic case. It is shown that the
estimators correctly identify the errors up to a factor of the order of unity.

deployments of virtualized Evolved Packet Core (EPC) - the core network

the latter option offering more lightweight characteristics. The first
contribution of this paper is the implementation of a number of custom

correlations that do not hold in the test as they hold in train) for good
predictive performance. Such models cannot be trusted in deployment

this work, we study and extend a causal pre-training debiasing technique called
causal bootstrapping (CB) under five practical confounded-data

these settings, we systematically investigate the effect of confounding bias on
deep learning model performance, demonstrating their propensity to rely on
shortcut biases when these biases are not properly accounted for. We
demonstrate that such a causal pre-training technique can significantly

through Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). However, client developers
can have issues identifying the correct usage of a certain API, causing misuses
accompanied by software crashes or usability bugs. Therefore, researchers have
aimed at identifying API misuses automatically by comparing client code usages
to correct API usages. Some techniques rely on certain API-specific graph-based
data structures to improve the abstract representation of API usages. Such
techniques need to compare graphs, for instance, by computing distance metrics
based on the minimal graph edit distance or the largest common subgraphs, whose
computations are known to be NP-hard problems. Fortunately, there exist many
abstractions for simplifying graph distance computation. However, their
applicability for comparing graph representations of API usages has not been
analyzed. In this paper, we provide a comparison of different distance
algorithms of API-usage graphs regarding correctness and runtime. Particularly,
correctness relates to the algorithms' ability to identify similar correct API
usages, but also to discriminate similar correct and false usages as well as
non-similar usages. For this purpose, we systematically identified a set of
eight graph-based distance algorithms and applied them on two datasets of
real-world API usages and misuses. Interestingly, our results suggest that
existing distance algorithms are not reliable for comparing API usage graphs.
To improve on this situation, we identified and discuss the algorithms' issues,
based on which we formulate hypotheses to initiate research on overcoming them.

condition of zero total area, ensures the conservation of optical power so the
refractive index shows balanced gain and loss. Consequently, the complex-valued
refractive indices reported in this work include but are not limited to the
parity-time invariant case.

along with other formation mechanisms that do not involve water. This study
aims to examine whether the evaporation of water vapor from the RSL, whether
from fresh water or brine, is detectable by observing water vapor and/or
clouds. In this study, we summarize the possible rate and duration of
water-vapor emission from RSL in different scenarios, simulate how the emitted
water vapor behaves in a global climate model, and discuss the detectability of
water vapor in nadir observations during existing and future explorations. We
found that, in typical cases, rapid horizontal dissipation within the planetary
boundary layer (PBL) following the release of water vapor prohibits cloud
formation and the excess water vapor from being distinguished from the
background with existing observations. Thus, we conclude that the lack of
correlation between the RSL activities and the overlying water-vapor column
density does not necessarily rule out the wet origin of RSL. Nevertheless, we
also found that water vapor tends to accumulate in basins and valleys in some
cases due to the combined effects of topography and low PBL; we suggest the
locations of such configuration as targets for future atmospheric studies of
Mars dedicated to quantifying water-vapor release (associated with RSL) to
elucidate the formation mechanism(s) of the RSL on the planet.

identifying the underlying etiology is essential for determining the best
treatment. However, differentiating between common medical diagnoses can be
challenging in clinical practice. Machine learning models could improve medical
diagnosis by aiding in the diagnostic evaluation of these patients. Materials
and Methods: Machine learning models were trained to predict the common causes
of acute respiratory failure (pneumonia, heart failure, and/or COPD). Models
were trained using chest radiographs and clinical data from the electronic
health record (EHR) and applied to an internal and external cohort. Results:
The internal cohort of 1,618 patients included 508 (31%) with pneumonia, 363
(22%) with heart failure, and 137 (8%) with COPD based on physician chart
review. A model combining chest radiographs and EHR data outperformed models
based on each modality alone. Models had similar or better performance compared
to a randomly selected physician reviewer. For pneumonia, the combined model
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was 0.79
(0.77-0.79), image model AUROC was 0.74 (0.72-0.75), and EHR model AUROC was
0.74 (0.70-0.76). For heart failure, combined: 0.83 (0.77-0.84), image: 0.80
(0.71-0.81), and EHR: 0.79 (0.75-0.82). For COPD, combined: AUROC = 0.88
(0.83-0.91), image: 0.83 (0.77-0.89), and EHR: 0.80 (0.76-0.84). In the
external cohort, performance was consistent for heart failure and increased for
COPD, but declined slightly for pneumonia. Conclusions: Machine learning models
combining chest radiographs and EHR data can accurately differentiate between
common causes of acute respiratory failure. Further work is needed to determine
how these models could act as a diagnostic aid to clinicians in clinical

approaches and conducted extensive experiments with 8 different classifiers
trained on 9 different speech representations. Our speech representations
ranged from traditional features (MFCC, LPC) to features learned with deep

  lattice mode analysis",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this work, we carry out first-principles calculations and lattice mode
analysis to investigate the polarization switching mechanism in HfO$_2$.
Because the stability of the polar orthorhombic $Pca2_1$ phase of HfO$_2$
arises from a trilinear coupling, polarization switching requires the flipping
of not only the polar $\Gamma_{15}^Z$ mode, but also at least one zone-boundary
anti-polar mode. The coupling between the polar and anti-polar modes thus leads
to substantial differences among different polarization switching paths.
Specifically, our lattice-mode-coupling analysis shows that paths in which the
$X_2^-$ mode is reversed involve a large activation energy, which because the
$X_2^-$ mode is nonpolar cannot be directly overcome by applying an electric
field. Our results show that the anti-polar $Pbca$ phase, whose structure is
locally quite similar to that of the $Pca2_1$ phase, similarly cannot be
transformed to this phase by an electric field as this would require local
reversal of the $X_2^-$ mode pattern. Moreover, for the domain wall structure
most widely considered, propagation also requires the reversal of the $X_2^-$
mode, leading to a much larger activation energy compared with that for the
propagation of domain wall structures with a single sign for the $X_2^-$ mode.
Finally, these first-principles results for domain wall propagation in HfO$_2$
have implications to many experimental observations, such as sluggish domain
wall motion and robust ferroelectricity in thin films, and lattice mode
analysis deepens our understanding of these distinctive properties of
ferroelectric HfO$_2$.

labeled training data, which presents a major challenge in practice, as
labeling segmentation masks is a highly labor-intensive process. To address
this issue, we present a framework for semi-supervised and domain-adaptive
semantic segmentation, which is enhanced by self-supervised monocular depth
estimation (SDE) trained only on unlabeled image sequences.
  In particular, we utilize SDE as an auxiliary task comprehensively across the
entire learning framework: First, we automatically select the most useful
samples to be annotated for semantic segmentation based on the correlation of
sample diversity and difficulty between SDE and semantic segmentation. Second,
we implement a strong data augmentation by mixing images and labels using the
geometry of the scene. Third, we transfer knowledge from features learned
during SDE to semantic segmentation by means of transfer and multi-task
learning. And fourth, we exploit additional labeled synthetic data with
Cross-Domain DepthMix and Matching Geometry Sampling to align synthetic and
real data.
  We validate the proposed model on the Cityscapes dataset, where all four
contributions demonstrate significant performance gains, and achieve
state-of-the-art results for semi-supervised semantic segmentation as well as
for semi-supervised domain adaptation. In particular, with only 1/30 of the
Cityscapes labels, our method achieves 92% of the fully-supervised baseline
performance and even 97% when exploiting additional data from GTA. The source

evolution is straightforward to obtain on introduction of a suitable choice of
a scalar field with a negative potential or a negative cosmological constant
which causes a recollapse at some time in the evolution. We present a counter
example to this conventional wisdom. Working in the realm of loop cosmological
models with non-perturbative quantum gravity modifications we show that a
modified version of standard loop quantum cosmology based on Thiemann's
regularization of the Hamiltonian constraint while generically non-singular
does not allow a cyclic evolution unless some highly restrictive conditions
hold. Irrespective of the energy density of other matter fields, a recollapse
and hence a cyclic evolution is only possible if one chooses an almost Planck
sized negative potential of the scalar field or a negative cosmological
constant. Further, cycles when present do not occur in the classical regime.
Surprisingly, a necessary condition for a cyclic evolution, not singularity
resolution, turns out to be a violation of the weak energy condition. These
results are in a striking contrast to standard loop quantum cosmology where
obtaining a recollapse at large volumes and a cyclic evolution is
straightforward, and, there is no violation of weak energy condition. On one
hand our work shows that some quantum cosmological models even though
non-singular and bouncing are incompatible with a cyclic evolution, and on the
other hand demonstrates that differences in various quantization prescriptions
in loop cosmology need not be faint and buried in the pre-bounce regime, but
can be striking and profound even in the post-bounce regime.

molecular core in M17. The multiwavelength data obtained during 1993--2019 show
significant mid-IR (MIR) variations, which can be split into three stages: the
decreasing phase during 1993.03--mid-2004, the quiescent phase from mid-2004 to
mid-2010, and the rebrightening phase from mid-2010 until now. The variation of
the 22\,GHz H$_2$O maser emission, together with the MIR variation, indicates
an enhanced disk accretion rate onto M17~MIR during the decreasing and
rebrightening phases. Radiative transfer modeling of the spectral energy
distributions of M17~MIR in the 2005 epoch (quiescent) and 2017 epoch
(accretion outburst) constrains the basic stellar parameters of M17~MIR, which
is an intermediate-mass protostar (M~5.4 Msun) with accretion rate ~1.1x10^-5
Msun in the 2005 epoch and ~1.7x10^-3 Msun/yr in the 2017 epoch. The enhanced
accretion rate during outburst induces the luminosity outburst $\Delta
L\approx7600 $Lsun. In the accretion outburst, a larger stellar radius is
required to produce accretion rate consistent with the value estimated from the
kinematics of water masers. M17 MIR shows two accretion outbursts ($\Delta
t\sim 9-20$ yr) with outburst magnitudes of 2 mag, separated by a 6 yr
quiescent phase. The accretion outbusrt occupies 83\% of the time over 26 yr.
The accretion rate in outburst is variable with amplitude much lower than the
contrast between quiescent and outburst phases. The extreme youth of M17 MIR
suggests that minor accretion bursts are frequent in the earliest stages of
massive star formation.

reproduce the equations of motion of classical STT while the $b_{-}$ branch of

investigate cosmological dynamics in an expanding universe whose background is
described by the the $b_{-}$ branch of equations of motion of STT, and we
especially focus on the dynamics of the perturbations in the low-energy limit
because it is most relevant to the current observational range. First, we find
a low-energy effective Hamiltonian which can yield the low-energy limit of the
$b_{-}$ branch of equations, this Hamiltonian consists of constraints whose
constraint algebra is different from the classical case but also closed up to
arbitrary order of perturbations. Remarkably, we find that this Hamiltonian can
be transformed into the Hamiltonian of the Einstein frame by field
redefinitions. Moreover, we also develop the linear cosmological perturbation
theory and apply it to study the slow-roll inflation. Finally, we study a
specific model of STT. In this model, a contracting universe described by
classical STT in the remote past can pass through the bounce and evolve into an
expanding universe whose background dynamics is described by the $b_{-}$ branch
of equations of motion. It is shown that the slow-roll inflation can take place
in this case, and the spectral indices of the slow-roll inflation agree well
with the observations. The results in this paper indicate that there exists an

due to its fundamental significance in scientific research, as well as its
crucial role in engineering applications. In this study, the contribution of
shock Mach number on the evolution of the RM instability induced by a
shock-accelerated square light bubble is investigated numerically. The square
bubble is composed of helium gas and the surrounding (ambient) gas is nitrogen.
Three cases of incident shock strength are considered: Ms = 1.21, 1.7, and 2.1.
An explicit mixed-type modal discontinuous Galerkin scheme with uniform meshes
is employed to numerically solve a two-dimensional system of unsteady
compressible Navier--Stokes--Fourier equations. The numerical results show that
the shock Mach number plays an important role during the interaction between a
planar shock wave and a square light bubble. The shock Mach number causes
significant changes in flow morphology, resulting in complex wave patterns,
vorticity generation, vortex formation, and bubble deformation. In contrast to
low Mach numbers, high Mach numbers produce the larger rolled-up vortex chains,
larger inward jet formation, and a stronger mixing zone with greater expansion.
The effects of Mach numbers are explored in detail through phenomena such as
the vorticity generation, and evolutions of enstrophy as well as dissipation
rate. Finally, the Mach number effects on the time-variations of the shock
trajectories and interface features are comprehensively analyzed.

recent years, fault diagnosis methods based on the Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) have been mature, but Transformer has
not been widely used in the field of fault diagnosis. To address these
deficiencies, a new method based on the Time Series Transformer (TST) is
proposed to recognize the fault mode of bearings. In this paper, our
contributions include: Firstly, we designed a tokens sequences generation
method which can handle data in 1D format, namely time series tokenizer. Then,
the TST combining time series tokenizer and Transformer was introduced.
Furthermore, the test results on the given dataset show that the proposed
method has better fault identification capability than the traditional CNN and
RNN models. Secondly, through the experiments, the effect of structural
hyperparameters such as subsequence length and embedding dimension on fault
diagnosis performance, computational complexity and parameters number of the
TST is analyzed in detail. The influence laws of some hyperparameters are
obtained. Finally, via t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
dimensionality reduction method, the feature vectors in the embedding space are
visualized. On this basis, the working pattern of TST has been explained to a
certain extent. Moreover, by analyzing the distribution form of the feature
vectors, we find that compared with the traditional CNN and RNN models, the
feature vectors extracted by the method in this paper show the best intra-class
compactness and inter-class separability. These results further demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

  Signal Processing Systems (SiPS)",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) is a recently proposed
Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoding technique. Irrespective of the structure of
the error correcting code, GRAND tries to guess the noise that corrupted the
codeword in order to decode any linear error-correcting block code. GRAND
Markov Order (GRAND-MO) is a variant of GRAND that is useful to decode error
correcting code transmitted over communication channels with memory which are
vulnerable to burst noise. Usually, interleavers and de-interleavers are used
in communication systems to mitigate the effects of channel memory.
Interleaving and de-interleaving introduce undesirable latency, which increases
with channel memory. To prevent this added latency penalty, GRAND-MO can be
directly used on the hard demodulated channel signals. This work reports the
first GRAND-MO hardware architecture which achieves an average throughput of up
to $52$ Gbps and $64$ Gbps for a code length of $128$ and $79$ respectively.
Compared to the GRANDAB, hard-input variant of GRAND, the proposed architecture
achieves $3$ dB gain in decoding performance for a target FER of $10^{-5}$.
Similarly, comparing the GRAND-MO decoder with a decoder tailored for a
$(79,64)$ BCH code showed that the proposed architecture achieves 33$\%$ higher
worst case throughput and $2$ dB gain in decoding performance.

across animal species, the use of complicated language is unique to humans and
is one of the most important aspects of intelligence.
  In this thesis, we focus on generating textual output given visual input. In
Chapter 3, we focus on generating the referring expression, a text description
for an object in the image so that a receiver can infer which object is being
described. We use a comprehension machine to directly guide the generated
referring expressions to be more discriminative. In Chapter 4, we introduce a
method that encourages discriminability in image caption generation. We show
that more discriminative captioning models generate more descriptive captions.
In Chapter 5, we study how training objectives and sampling methods affect the
models' ability to generate diverse captions. We find that a popular captioning
training strategy will be detrimental to the diversity of generated captions.
In Chapter 6, we propose a model that can control the length of generated
captions. By changing the desired length, one can influence the style and
descriptiveness of the captions. Finally, in Chapter 7, we rank/generate
informative image tags according to their information utility. The proposed

A conventional DPA succeeds fully on the 1D array, requiring 20K power

partially explicit time discretizations for linear equations. The
contrast-independent partially explicit time discretization divides the spatial
space into two components: contrast dependent (fast) and contrast independent

decomposition, temporal splitting is proposed that treats fast components
implicitly and slow components explicitly. The space decomposition and temporal
splitting are chosen such that it guarantees a stability and formulate a
condition for the time stepping. This condition is formulated as a condition on
slow spaces. In this paper, we extend this approach to nonlinear problems. We

This condition requires some type of contrast-independent spaces for slow

method is proposed. The method can produce a consistent estimator of the
parameter of interest even if many of the data sources are biased. The proposed
estimator is easy to compute and only employs summary statistics, and hence can
be applied to many different fields, e.g. meta-analysis, Mendelian

asymptotically equivalent to the oracle estimator that only uses data from
unbiased sources under some mild conditions. Asymptotic normality of the
proposed estimator is also established. In contrast to the existing
meta-analysis methods, the theoretical properties are guaranteed even if both
the number of data sources and the dimension of the parameter diverge as the

has completely real values when the index gradient is applied perpendicular to
the ribbon, and a triply degenerated (third-order) EP with coalesced
eigenvalues and eigenvectors emerges only when the amplitude of gain/loss ratio
reaches a certain threshold value. When the index gradient is applied parallel
to the ribbon, the LZB oscillations exhibit intriguing characteristics
including asymmetric energy transition and pseudo-Hermitian propagation as the

oscillatory motion passes through the EP, leading to distinct energy

  Language Understanding","Accepted to NAACL 2022 (Long Paper)",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Building machine learning models for natural language understanding (NLU)
tasks relies heavily on labeled data. Weak supervision has been proven valuable
when large amount of labeled data is unavailable or expensive to obtain.
Existing works studying weak supervision for NLU either mostly focus on a
specific task or simulate weak supervision signals from ground-truth labels. It
is thus hard to compare different approaches and evaluate the benefit of weak
supervision without access to a unified and systematic benchmark with diverse
tasks and real-world weak labeling rules. In this paper, we propose such a
benchmark, named WALNUT (semi-WeAkly supervised Learning for Natural language
Understanding Testbed), to advocate and facilitate research on weak supervision
for NLU. WALNUT consists of NLU tasks with different types, including
document-level and token-level prediction tasks. WALNUT is the first
semi-weakly supervised learning benchmark for NLU, where each task contains
weak labels generated by multiple real-world weak sources, together with a
small set of clean labels. We conduct baseline evaluations on WALNUT to
systematically evaluate the effectiveness of various weak supervision methods
and model architectures. Our results demonstrate the benefit of weak
supervision for low-resource NLU tasks and highlight interesting patterns
across tasks. We expect WALNUT to stimulate further research on methodologies
to leverage weak supervision more effectively. The benchmark and code for
baselines are available at \url{aka.ms/walnut_benchmark}.

offer instant-delivery to local customers ordering their products online.
Offering such delivery services both cost-efficiently and reliably is one of
the main challenges for local delivery platforms, as they face a complex,
dynamic, stochastic dynamic pickup-and-delivery problem. Orders need to be
consolidated to increase the efficiency of the delivery operations and thereby
enable a high service guarantee towards the customer and stores. But, waiting
for consolidation opportunities may jeopardize delivery service reliability in
the future, and thus requires anticipating future demand. This paper introduces
a generic approach to balance the consolidation potential and delivery urgency
of orders. Specifically, it presents a newly developed parameterized
Cost-Function Approximation (CFA) approach that modifies a set-packing
formulation with two parameters. This CFA approach not only anticipates future
demand but also utilizes column generation to search the large decision space
related to pickup-and-delivery problems fast. Inspired by a motivating
application in the city of Groningen, the Netherlands, numerical experiments
show that our CFA approach strongly increases perceived customer satisfaction
while lowering the total travel time of the vehicles compared to various
benchmark policies. Furthermore, our CFA also reduces the percentage of late
deliveries, and their lateness, to a minimum. Finally, our approach may assist
managers in practice to manage the non-trivial balance between consolidation
opportunity and delivery urgency.

ranges of application potentials. Deep neural networks have advanced this field
by leveraging the power of large-scale labeled data, which, however, are
extremely expensive and time-consuming to acquire. One solution is to use cheap
available data to train a model and deploy it to directly process the data from
a specific application domain. Nevertheless, the well-known domain shift (DS)
issue prevents the trained model from generalizing well on the target domain.
In this paper, we propose a novel stagewise domain adaptation model called
RoadDA to address the DS issue in this field. In the first stage, RoadDA adapts
the target domain features to align with the source ones via generative
adversarial networks (GAN) based inter-domain adaptation. Specifically, a
feature pyramid fusion module is devised to avoid information loss of long and
thin roads and learn discriminative and robust features. Besides, to address
the intra-domain discrepancy in the target domain, in the second stage, we
propose an adversarial self-training method. We generate the pseudo labels of
target domain using the trained generator and divide it to labeled easy split
and unlabeled hard split based on the road confidence scores. The features of
hard split are adapted to align with the easy ones using adversarial learning
and the intra-domain adaptation process is repeated to progressively improve
the segmentation performance. Experiment results on two benchmarks demonstrate
that RoadDA can efficiently reduce the domain gap and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.

  Side Information",,,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Adaptive multiple testing with covariates is an important research direction
that has gained major attention in recent years. It has been widely recognized
that leveraging side information provided by auxiliary covariates can improve
the power of false discovery rate (FDR) procedures. Currently, most such
procedures are devised with $p$-values as their main statistics. However, for
two-sided hypotheses, the usual data processing step that transforms the
primary statistics, known as $z$-values, into $p$-values not only leads to a
loss of information carried by the main statistics, but can also undermine the
ability of the covariates to assist with the FDR inference. We develop a
$z$-value based covariate-adaptive (ZAP) methodology that operates on the
intact structural information encoded jointly by the $z$-values and covariates.
It seeks to emulate the oracle $z$-value procedure via a working model, and its
rejection regions significantly depart from those of the $p$-value adaptive
testing approaches. The key strength of ZAP is that the FDR control is
guaranteed with minimal assumptions, even when the working model is
misspecified. We demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ZAP using both
simulated and real data, which shows that the efficiency gain can be
substantial in comparison with $p$-value based methods. Our methodology is
implemented in the $\texttt{R}$ package $\texttt{zap}$.

consider a global network of identical chaotic maps, which splits into two
different clusters, despite the interaction between all nodes are uniform. The
stability analysis of the spatially homogeneous chaotic solutions provides a
critical coupling strength, before which we anticipate such partial
synchronization. The distance between these two chaotic synchronized
populations often deviates more than eight times of standard deviation from its
long-term average. The probability density function of these highly deviated
values fits well with the Generalized Extreme Value distribution. Meanwhile,
the distribution of recurrence time intervals between extreme events resembles
the Weibull distribution. The existing literature helps us to characterize such
events as extreme events using the significant height. These extremely high
fluctuations are less frequent in terms of their occurrence. We determine
numerically a range of coupling strength for these extremely large but
recurrent events. On-off intermittency is the responsible mechanism underlying
the formation of such extreme events. Besides understanding the generation of
such extreme events and their statistical signature, we furnish forecasting
these events using the powerful deep learning algorithms of an artificial

one-step forecasting of these chaotic intermittent bursts. We also ensure the

a novel group activity recognition network termed GroupFormer. It captures

A tailor-modified Transformer, Clustered Spatial-Temporal Transformer, is
proposed to enhance the individual representation and group representation. (2)
It models the spatial and temporal dependencies integrally and utilizes
decoders to build the bridge between the spatial and temporal information. (3)
A clustered attention mechanism is utilized to dynamically divide individuals
into multiple clusters for better learning activity-aware semantic
representations. Moreover, experimental results show that the proposed

rules from the unit cube $[0,1]^d$ to properly sized boxes on $\mathbb{R}^d$,
hereby achieving higher-order convergence that matches the smoothness of the
integrand function $f$ in a certain Sobolev space of dominating mixed
smoothness. Our method only assumes that we can evaluate the integrand function
$f$ and does not assume a particular density nor the ability to sample from it.
In particular, for the theoretical analysis we show a new result that the
method of adding Bernoulli polynomials to a function to make it ""periodic"" on a
box without changing its integral value over the box, is equivalent to an
orthogonal projection from a well chosen Sobolev space of dominating mixed
smoothness to an associated periodic Sobolev space of the same dominating mixed
smoothness, which we call a Korobov space. We note that the Bernoulli
polynomial method is often not used because of its excessive computational
complexity and also here we only make use of it in our theoretical analysis. We
show that our new method of applying scaled lattice rules to increasing boxes
can be interpreted as orthogonal projections with decreasing projection error.
Such a method would not work on the unit cube since then the committed error
caused by non-periodicity of the integrand would be constant, but for
integration on the Euclidean space we can use the certain decay towards zero
when the boxes grow. Hence we can bound the truncation error as well as the
projection error and show higher-order convergence in applying scaled lattice
rules for integration on Euclidean space. We illustrate our theoretical
analysis by numerical experiments which confirm our findings.

promising technology to cover the demands for higher data rates in
fifth-generation (5G) networks and beyond. These systems assume a large number
of distributed access points (APs) using joint coherent transmission to
communicate with the users. However, CF mMIMO systems present an increasing
computational complexity as the number of users increases. Scalable cell-free
CF (SCF) systems have been proposed to face this challenge. Given that the
cost-efficient deployment of such large networks requires low-cost
transceivers, which are prone to unavoidable hardware imperfections, realistic
evaluations of SCF mMIMO systems should take them into account before
implementation. Hence, in this work, we focus on the impact of hardware
impairments (HWIs) on the SCF mMIMO systems through a general model accounting
for both additive and multiplicative impairments. Notably, there is no other
work in the literature studying the impact of phase noise (PN) in the local
oscillators (LOs) of CF mMIMO systems or in general the impact of any HWIs in
SCF mMIMO systems. In particular, we derive upper and lower bounds on the
uplink capacity accounting for HWIs. Moreover, we obtain the optimal
hardware-aware (HA) partial minimum mean-squared error (PMMSE) combiner.
Especially, the lower bound is derived in closed-form using the theory of
deterministic equivalents (DEs). Among the interesting findings, we observe
that separate LOs (SLOs) outperform a common LO (CLO), and the additive
transmit distortion degrades more the performance than the additive receive
distortion.

intelligent individuals adjust their strategies in collective interactions. It
has been widely believed that it is impossible to unilaterally control players'
payoffs in games, since payoffs are jointly determined by all players. Until
recently, a class of so-called zero-determinant strategies are revealed, which
enables a player to make a unilateral payoff control over her partners in
two-action repeated games with a constant continuation probability. The
existing methods, however, lead to the curse of dimensionality when the
complexity of games increases. In this paper, we propose a new mathematical
framework to study ruling strategies (with which a player unilaterally makes a
linear relation rule on players' payoffs) in repeated games with an arbitrary
number of actions or players, and arbitrary continuation probability. We
establish an existence theorem of ruling strategies and develop an algorithm to
find them. In particular, we prove that strict Markov ruling strategy exists
only if either the repeated game proceeds for an infinite number of rounds, or
every round is repeated with the same probability. The proposed mathematical
framework also enables the search of collaborative ruling strategies for an
alliance to control outsiders. Our method provides novel theoretical insights
into payoff control in complex repeated games, which overcomes the curse of
dimensionality.

prerequisite to generate predictive models for a wide range of applications.
Use of sampling-based approaches such as Markov chain Monte Carlo may become
intractable when each likelihood evaluation is computationally expensive. New
approaches combining variational inference with normalizing flow are
characterized by a computational cost that grows only linearly with the
dimensionality of the latent variable space, and rely on gradient-based
optimization instead of sampling, providing a more efficient approach for
Bayesian inference about the model parameters. Moreover, the cost of frequently
evaluating an expensive likelihood can be mitigated by replacing the true model
with an offline trained surrogate model, such as neural networks. However, this
approach might generate significant bias when the surrogate is insufficiently
accurate around the posterior modes. To reduce the computational cost without
sacrificing inferential accuracy, we propose Normalizing Flow with Adaptive
Surrogate (NoFAS), an optimization strategy that alternatively updates the
normalizing flow parameters and surrogate model parameters. We also propose an
efficient sample weighting scheme for surrogate model training that preserves
global accuracy while effectively capturing high posterior density regions. We
demonstrate the inferential and computational superiority of NoFAS against
various benchmarks, including cases where the underlying model lacks

consumption, especially in South Asia, and severe health risks. Nevertheless,
food image analysis using multispectral imaging systems(MISs) has not been
applied to oil reheating analysis despite their vast application in rapid food
quality screening. To that end, the paper discusses the application of a
low-cost MSI to estimate the 'reheat cycle count classes' (number of times an
oil sample is recursively heated) and identify 'critical classes' at which
substantial changes in the oil sample have materialized. Firstly, the reheat
cycle count class is estimated with Bhattacharyya distance between the reheated
and a pure oil sample as the input. The classification was performed using a
support vector machine classifier that resulted in an accuracy of 83.34 % for
reheat cycle count identification. Subsequently, an unsupervised clustering
procedure was introduced using a modified spectral clustering (SC) algorithm to
distinguish critical classes under reheating. In addition, laboratory
experiments were performed to ascertain the ramifications of the reheating
process with a chemical analysis. The chemical analysis of the coconut oil
samples used in the experiment coincided with the chemical analysis results and
was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Accordingly, the proposed work closes
the gap for using multispectral imaging for oil reheating and proposes a novel
algorithm for unsupervised detection of critical property changes in the oil.
Hence, the proposed research work is significant in its practical implications,
contribution to food image analysis, and unsupervised classification
mechanisms.

intra-sentential switching. To achieve such an ambitious goal, new mechanisms
for foreign pronunciation generation and language model (LM) enrichment have
been devised. Specifically, we have designed an automatic approach to obtain
high quality pronunciation of foreign language (FL) words in the native

LSTM-based grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) model. Improved accented pronunciations
have thus been obtained by learning foreign pronunciations directly from data.
Furthermore, a code-switching LM was deployed by converting the original NL LM
into a CS LM using translated word pairs and borrowing statistics for the NL
LM. Experimental evidence clearly demonstrates that our approach better deals
with accented foreign pronunciations than techniques based on human labeling.
Moreover, our best system achieves a 55.5% relative word error rate reduction
from 34.4%, obtained with a conventional monolingual ASR system, to 15.3% on an
intra-sentential CS task without harming the monolingual recognition accuracy.

conclude with a set of recommendations for the geoengineering research
community whereby more inclusive research can become a regular part of
practice. Throughout this process, we illustrate how feminist science scholars
can use this approach to study climate modeling.

images and data that has spatial and temporal dimensions. How to show the
spectrum of these multi-dimensional signals correctly is a key challenge in the
field of graph signal processing. This paper investigates the novel transform
for multi-dimensional signals defined on Cartesian product graph and studies
several related properties. Our work includes: (i) defining the
multi-dimensional graph fractional Fourier transform (MGFRFT) based on
Laplacian matrix and adjacency matrix; (ii) exploring the advantages of MGFRFT
in processing multi-dimensional signals in terms of spectrum and computational
time; (iii) applying the proposed transform to data compression to highlight
the utility and effectiveness of it.

Smith","Design of Conformal Array of Rectangular Waveguide-fed Metasurfaces",,,"10.1109/TAP.2022.3140822",,"physics.app-ph eess.SP physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  We present a systematic design method for a cylindrical conformal array of
rectangular waveguide-fed metasurfaces. The conformal metasurface consists of
multiple curved rectangular waveguides loaded with metamaterial
elements\textemdash electrically small irises\textemdash inserted into the
upper conducting walls of the waveguides. Each element radiates energy into
free space to contribute to an overall radiation pattern. Thus, the geometry or
electrical configuration of each of the individual metamaterial elements needs
to be tailored to generate a desired pattern. In general, due to difficulties
in modeling the effect of curvature, the design of conformal metasurface arrays
has relied on full-wave simulations or experiments. In this study, we propose a
design method utilizing the analytic model of a planar metasurface accounting
for metamaterial elements' locations and orientations over a surface with
curvature. Although approximate, we demonstrate that such an alteration along
with the framework of dipolar modeling of planar elements can be used for the
analysis of conformal arrays with small curvature. We then design a conformal
array metasurface using the method combined with CMA-ES optimizer. Through
numerical simulations, we confirm the validity of the proposed design method.
Applications include the design of metasurfaces for radar, communications, and
imaging systems for automobiles and airplanes.

  Powder Bed Fusion Ti-6Al-4V Alloy Described by Neural Network Models",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci cs.LG physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this study, the effects of surface roughness and pore characteristics on
fatigue lives of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) Ti-6Al-4V parts were
investigated. The 197 fatigue bars were printed using the same laser power but
with varied scanning speeds. These actions led to variations in the geometries
of microscale pores, and such variations were characterized using
micro-computed tomography. To generate differences in surface roughness in
fatigue bars, half of the samples were grit-blasted and the other half
machined. Fatigue behaviors were analyzed with respect to surface roughness and
statistics of the pores. For the grit-blasted samples, the contour laser scan
in the LPBF strategy led to a pore-depletion zone isolating surface and
internal pores with different features. For the machined samples, where surface
pores resemble internal pores, the fatigue life was highly correlated with the
average pore size and projected pore area in the plane perpendicular to the
stress direction. Finally, a machine learning model using a drop-out neural
network (DONN) was employed to establish a link between surface and pore
features to the fatigue data (logN), and good prediction accuracy was
demonstrated. Besides predicting fatigue lives, the DONN can also estimate the
prediction uncertainty.
