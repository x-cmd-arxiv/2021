artificial intelligence (AI) by investing in government capacity to
systematically measure and monitor the capabilities and impacts of AI systems.
If adopted, this would give governments greater information about the AI
ecosystem, equipping them to more effectively direct AI development and
deployment in the most societally and economically beneficial directions. It
would also create infrastructure that could rapidly identify potential threats
or harms that could occur as a consequence of changes in the AI ecosystem, such
as the emergence of strategically transformative capabilities, or the
deployment of harmful systems.
  We begin by outlining the problem which motivates this proposal: in brief,
traditional governance approaches struggle to keep pace with the speed of
progress in AI. We then present our proposal for addressing this problem:
governments must invest in measurement and monitoring infrastructure. We
discuss this proposal in detail, outlining what specific things governments
could focus on measuring and monitoring, and the kinds of benefits this would
generate for policymaking. Finally, we outline some potential pilot projects
and some considerations for implementing this in practice.

initiation and propagation within an arbitrary anisotropic solid. In

models by extending the idea introduced in \cite{REZAEI2021a} for
direction-dependent fracture energy and also anisotropic PF damage models based
on structural tensors. The cohesive PF damage formulation used in the current
contribution is motivated by the works of \cite{LORENTZ201120, wu2018,
GEELEN2019}. The results of the latter models are shown to be insensitive with
respect to the length scale parameter for the isotropic case. This is because
they manage to formulate the fracture energy as a function of diffuse
displacement jumps in the localized damaged zone. In the present paper, we
discuss numerical examples and details on finite element implementations where
the fracture energy, as well as the material strength, are introduced as an
arbitrary function of the crack direction. Using the current formulation for
anisotropic cohesive fracture, the obtained results are almost insensitive with
respect to the length scale parameter. The latter is achieved by including the
direction-dependent strength of the material in addition to its fracture
energy. Utilizing the current formulation, one can increase the mesh size which
reduces the computational time significantly without any severe change in the
predicted crack path and overall obtained load-displacement curves. We also
argue that these models still lack to capture mode-dependent fracture
properties. Open issues and possible remedies for future developments are
finally discussed as well.

into account either assuming that guide field flux is conserved resulting in
non-force-free profiles in general, or that magnetic helicity is conserved and
Taylor relaxation occurs to convert part of the summed guide field flux into
reconnecting field flux towards minimum energy states resulting in force-free
profiles. It is found that the plasmoid distribution in terms of reconnecting
field flux follows a power law with index 7/4 or 1 depending on whether merger
frequencies are independent of or dependent on their relative velocity to the
outflow speed, respectively. This result is approximately the same for the
force-free and non-force-free models, with non-force-free models exhibiting
indices of 2 and 1 for the same velocity dependencies. Distributions in terms
of guide field flux yield indices of 3/2 for the non-force-free model
regardless of velocity dependence. This is notably distinct from the indices of
11/8 and 1 for the force-free models independent of and dependent on velocity,
respectively. At low guide field fluxes the force-free models exhibit a second
power law index of 1/2 due to non-constant flux growth rates. The velocity
dependent force-free model predicts the production of slightly more rapidly
moving large guide field flux plasmoids which is supported by observational
evidence of flux ropes with strong core fields. Implications are discussed on
particle acceleration via Fermi processes.

codeword symbols on the dimension of linear codes, based on a combinatorial
proxy that we call \emph{visible rank}. The locality constraints of a linear
code are stipulated by a matrix $H$ of $\star$'s and $0$'s (which we call a
""stencil""), whose rows correspond to the local parity checks (with the
$\star$'s indicating the support of the check). The visible rank of $H$ is the
largest $r$ for which there is a $r \times r$ submatrix in $H$ with a unique
generalized diagonal of $\star$'s. The visible rank yields a field-independent
combinatorial lower bound on the rank of $H$ and thus the co-dimension of the
code.
  We prove a rank-nullity type theorem relating visible rank to the rank of an
associated construct called \emph{symmetric spanoid}, which was introduced by
Dvir, Gopi, Gu, and Wigderson~\cite{DGGW20}. Using this connection and a
construction of appropriate stencils, we answer a question posed in
\cite{DGGW20} and demonstrate that symmetric spanoid rank cannot improve the
currently best known $\widetilde{O}(n^{(q-2)/(q-1)})$ upper bound on the
dimension of $q$-query locally correctable codes (LCCs) of length $n$.
  We also study the $t$-Disjoint Repair Group Property ($t$-DRGP) of codes
where each codeword symbol must belong to $t$ disjoint check equations. It is
known that linear $2$-DRGP codes must have co-dimension $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. We
show that there are stencils corresponding to $2$-DRGP with visible rank as
small as $O(\log n)$. However, we show the second tensor of any $2$-DRGP
stencil has visible rank $\Omega(n)$, thus recovering the $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$
lower bound for $2$-DRGP. For $q$-LCC, however, the $k$'th tensor power for
$k\le n^{o(1)}$ is unable to improve the $\widetilde{O}(n^{(q-2)/(q-1)})$ upper

wind turbine models. The nonconvex transmission network constraints including
the VSC-MTDC system and FACTS devices are convexified through the proposed
second-order cone AC optimal power flow model (SOC-ACOPF) that can be solved to
the global optimality using interior point method. In order to tackle the

a hot and baryonless matter with an ambient magnetic field but the matter
produced at heavy-ion collider experiments is not perfectly baryonless, so we
wish to explore the effect of small baryon asymmetry on the properties of heavy
quarkonia immersed in a strongly magnetized hot quark matter. Therefore, we
have first revisited the structure of gluon self-energy tensor in the above
environment to compute the resummed propagator for gluons. This resummed
propagator embodies the properties of medium, which gets translated into the
(complex) potential between $Q$ and $\bar Q$ placed in the medium. We observe
that the baryon asymmetry makes the real-part of potential slightly more
attractive and weakens the imaginary-part. This opposing effects thus lead to
the enhancement of binding energies and the reduction of thermal widths of $Q
\bar Q$ ground states, respectively. Finally, the properties of quarkonia thus
deciphered facilitates to compute the dissociation points of $J/\psi$ and
$\Upsilon$, which are found to have slightly larger values in the presence of
baryon asymmetry. For example, $J/\psi$ is dissociated at $1.64~T_c$,
$1.69~T_c$, and $1.75~T_c$, whereas $\Upsilon$ is dissociated at $1.95~T_c$,
$1.97~T_c$ and $2.00 ~T_c$, for
  $\mu=0, 60$ and $ 100 $ MeV, respectively. This observation prevents early
dissociation of quarkonia in the matter produced at ultrarelativistic heavy ion
collisions with a small net baryon number, compared to the ideal baryonless
matter.

epitaxially at temperatures below 400 {\deg}C, luminesce brightly at room

relatively long lifetimes in PbSe thin films are achievable despite threading
dislocation densities exceeding $10^9$ $cm^{-2}$ arising from island growth on
the nearly 8% lattice- and crystal-structure-mismatched GaAs substrate. Using
quasi-continuous-wave and time-resolved photoluminescence, we show
Shockley-Read-Hall recombination is slow in our high dislocation density PbSe
films at room temperature, a hallmark of defect tolerance. Power-dependent
photoluminescence and high injection excess carrier lifetimes at room
temperature suggest that degenerate Auger recombination limits the efficiency
of our films, though the Auger recombination rates are significantly lower than
equivalent, III-V bulk materials and even a bit slower than expectations for
bulk PbSe. Consequently, the combined effects of defect tolerance and low Auger
recombination rates yield an estimated peak internal quantum efficiency of
roughly 30% at room temperature, unparalleled in the MWIR for a severely
lattice-mismatched thin film. We anticipate substantial opportunities for
improving performance by optimizing crystal growth as well as understanding
Auger processes in thin films. These results highlight the unique opportunity

density field that exploits a degeneracy in the impact of different
cosmological parameters on the linear dimensionless matter power spectrum,
$\Delta^2_{\rm L}(k)$. We classify all cosmological parameters into two groups,
shape parameters, which determine the shape of $\Delta^2_{\rm L}(k)$, and
evolution parameters, which only affect its amplitude at any given redshift.
With this definition, the time evolution of $\Delta^2_{\rm L}(k)$ in models
with identical shape parameters but different evolution parameters can be
mapped from one to the other by relabelling the redshifts that correspond to
the same clustering amplitude, which we characterize by the linear mass
fluctuation in spheres of radius $12\,{\rm Mpc}$, $\sigma_{12}(z)$. We use
N-body simulations to show that the same evolution mapping relation gives a
good description of the non-linear power spectrum, the halo mass function, or
the full density field. The deviations from the exact degeneracy are the result
of the different structure formation histories experienced by each model to
reach the same clustering amplitude and can be accurately described in terms of
differences in the suppression factor $g(a) = D(a)/a$. These relations can be
used to drastically reduce the number of parameters required to describe the
cosmology dependence of the power spectrum. We show how this can help to speed
up the inference of parameter constraints from cosmological observations. We
also present a new design of an emulator of the non-linear power spectrum whose
predictions can be adapted to an arbitrary choice of evolution parameters and

galaxies close to larger groups lack HI compared with those located more than

under-provisioning, and learns to harvest idle resources safely and accelerates
functions efficiently by applying deep reinforcement learning algorithms along
with a safeguard mechanism. We have implemented and deployed a Freyr prototype

the unreliability of current Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDSs).
Consequently, network interruptions and loss of sensitive data have occurred,

analysis of related works, it was observed that most researchers aim to obtain
better classification results by using a set of untried combinations of Feature
Reduction (FR) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques on NIDS datasets. However,
these datasets are different in feature sets, attack types, and network design.
Therefore, this paper aims to discover whether these techniques can be
generalised across various datasets. Six ML models are utilised: a Deep Feed
Forward (DFF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network
(RNN), Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), and Naive Bayes (NB). The
accuracy of three Feature Extraction (FE) algorithms; Principal Component
Analysis (PCA), Auto-encoder (AE), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), are
evaluated using three benchmark datasets: UNSW-NB15, ToN-IoT and

determination of their optimal number of extracted dimensions has been
overlooked. The results indicate that no clear FE method or ML model can
achieve the best scores for all datasets. The optimal number of extracted
dimensions has been identified for each dataset, and LDA degrades the
performance of the ML models on two datasets. The variance is used to analyse
the extracted dimensions of LDA and PCA. Finally, this paper concludes that the
choice of datasets significantly alters the performance of the applied

them as a resource for single spin qubits has thus far remained elusive. Here,

  Accepted for publication in the Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences",,"10.1175/JAS-D-21-0213.1",,"physics.ao-ph math.DS physics.data-an physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Atmospheric regime transitions are highly impactful as drivers of extreme
weather events, but pose two formidable modeling challenges: predicting the
next event (weather forecasting), and characterizing the statistics of events
of a given severity (the risk climatology). Each event has a different duration
and spatial structure, making it hard to define an objective ""average event.""
We argue here that transition path theory (TPT), a stochastic process
framework, is an appropriate tool for the task. We demonstrate TPT's capacities
on a wave-mean flow model of sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) developed by
Holton and Mass (1976), which is idealized enough for transparent TPT analysis
but complex enough to demonstrate computational scalability. Whereas a recent
article (Finkel et al. 2021) studied near-term SSW predictability, the present
article uses TPT to link predictability to long-term SSW frequency. This
requires not only forecasting forward in time from an initial condition, but
also \emph{backward in time} to assess the probability of the initial
conditions themselves. TPT enables one to condition the dynamics on the regime
transition occurring, and thus visualize its physical drivers with a vector
field called the \emph{reactive current}. The reactive current shows that
before an SSW, dissipation and stochastic forcing drive a slow decay of vortex
strength at lower altitudes. The response of upper-level winds is late and
sudden, occurring only after the transition is almost complete from a
probabilistic point of view. This case study demonstrates that TPT quantities,
visualized in a space of physically meaningful variables, can help one
understand the dynamics of regime transitions.

target of cyberattacks. Powerful Machine Learning (ML) models have recently
been adopted to implement network intrusion detection systems to protect IoT

data features is crucial, maximising the detection accuracy and computational
efficiency. This paper comprehensively analyses feature sets' importance and
predictive power for detecting network attacks. Three feature selection
algorithms: chi-square, information gain and correlation, have been utilised to
identify and rank data features. The attributes are fed into two ML
classifiers: deep feed-forward and random forest, to measure their attack
detection performance. The experimental evaluation considered three datasets:
UNSW-NB15, CSE-CIC-IDS2018, and ToN-IoT in their proprietary flow format. In
addition, the respective variants in NetFlow format were also considered, i.e.,

explored the marginal benefit of adding individual features. Our results show
that the accuracy initially increases rapidly with adding features but
converges quickly to the maximum. This demonstrates a significant potential to
reduce the computational and storage cost of intrusion detection systems while
maintaining near-optimal detection accuracy. This has particular relevance in
IoT systems, with typically limited computational and storage resources.

concentration may easily lead to crack initiation and development. The main
goal of this work is to develop a simple numerical method to predict the
structural strength and crack-growth-path of U-notched specimens made of
brittle materials. For this purpose, the Fragile Points Method (FPM), as
previously proposed by the authors, has been augmented by an interface
debonding model at the interfaces of the FPM domains, to simulate crack
initiation and development. The formulations of FPM are based on a
discontinuous Galerkin weak form where point-based piece-wise-continuous
polynomial test and trial functions are used instead of element-based basis
functions. In this work, the numerical fluxes introduced across interior
interfaces between subdomains are postulated as the tractions acting on the
interface derived from an interface damage model. The interface damage is
triggered when the numerical flux reaches the interface strength, and the
process of crack-surface separation is governed by the fracture energy. In this
way, arbitrary crack initiation and propagation can be naturally simulated
without the need for knowing the fracture-patch before-hand. Additionally, a
small penalty parameter is sufficient to enforce the weak-form continuity
condition before damage initiation, without causing problems such as artificial
compliance and numerical ill-conditioning. As validations, the proposed FPM
method with the interface damage model is used to predict the structural
strength and crack-development from U-notched structures made of brittle
materials, which is useful but challenging in engineering structural design
practices.

are clustered to reveal sets of actions with common risk levels; these are used
to create authorization decision boundaries. In addition, we propose a method
for assessing the risk level and labelling the clusters with respect to their

distinct depending on the exciton nature, causing unexpected reverse ordering

means of modulating the orbital spatial localization towards charge separation
that is mandatory for a charge-transfer exciton. Meanwhile, it manifests the
intra-energy-level splitting that counterbalances the distinct many-body
effects felt by excitons of different nature, thus ensuring the successful
generation of energetically favourable charge-transfer exciton in both

twistroincs into zero-dimensional materials, and provides a genuine route of

the spin-$1$ SU(3) bilinear-biquadratic model on the square lattice, which was
suggested to host a nematic spin liquid state in recent DMRG calculations. We
report that this spin liquid appears to strongly compete with a
three-sublattice magnetic order. To further study the competition between the
two states, and the reason of the emergent nematic spin liquid, we included an
additional next-nearest-neighbor SU(3) symmetric interactions along one of the
two plaquette diagonal directions. This allows to tune the square-lattice model
to the triangular-lattice model. By computing spin correlation functions and
various order parameters, we find that the three-sublattice order may develop
at infinitesimal additional new coupling, at least within the precision of our
study. Compared with the previous findings that the nematic spin liquid is
stable in extended parameter regions with additional couplings that respect the
lattice symmetries of the square lattice, we argue that here the diagonal
couplings, which frustrate the bipartite-lattice structure, rapidly suppress
the two-sublattice fluctuations and the three-sublattice order thus wins. This
numerical result is consistent with the conjecture that the nematic spin liquid
emerges from the competition between two- and three-sublattice fluctuations.

MU-MC-VLC system model is established, and then a sum-rate maximization problem
under dimming level and illumination uniformity constraints is formulated. In
this studied problem, the indices of activated LEDs and precoding matrices are
optimized, which result in a complex non-convex mixed integer problem. To solve
this problem, the original problem is separated into two subproblems. The first
subproblem, which maximizes the sum-rate of users via optimizing the LED
selection with a given precoding matrix, is a mixed integer problem solved by
the penalty method. With the optimized LED selection matrix, the second
subproblem which focuses on the maximization of the sum-rate via optimizing the
precoding matrix is solved by the Lagrangian dual method. Finally, these two
subproblems are iteratively solved to obtain a convergent solution. Simulation
results verify that in a typical indoor scenario under a dimming level of 70%,
the mean bandwidth efficiency of TASP-HD is 4.8 bit/s/Hz and 7.13 bit/s/Hz
greater than AD and DD, respectively.

representation of possibly infinite sets of strings. In this work, we introduce
the notion of second-order finite automata, a formalism that combines finite
automata with ordered decision diagrams, with the aim of representing possibly
infinite {\em sets of sets} of strings. Our main result states that
second-order finite automata can be canonized with respect to the second-order
languages they represent. Using this canonization result, we show that sets of
sets of strings represented by second-order finite automata are closed under
the usual Boolean operations, such as union, intersection, difference and even
under a suitable notion of complementation. Additionally, emptiness of
intersection and inclusion are decidable.
  We provide two algorithmic applications for second-order automata. First, we
show that several width/size minimization problems for deterministic and
nondeterministic ODDs are solvable in fixed-parameter tractable time when
parameterized by the width of the input ODD. In particular, our results imply
FPT algorithms for corresponding width/size minimization problems for ordered
binary decision diagrams (OBDDs) with a fixed variable ordering. Previously,
only algorithms that take exponential time in the size of the input OBDD were
known for width minimization, even for OBDDs of constant width. Second, we show
that for each $k$ and $w$ one can count the number of distinct functions
computable by ODDs of width at most $w$ and length $k$ in time
$h(|\Sigma|,w)\cdot k^{O(1)}$, for a suitable $h:\mathbb{N}\times
\mathbb{N}\rightarrow \mathbb{N}$. This improves exponentially on the time
necessary to explicitly enumerate all such functions, which is exponential in
both the width parameter $w$ and in the length $k$ of the ODDs.

block graph which achieves this bound is called a lower bound block graph. We
prove three necessary and sufficient conditions for lower bound block graphs.
Moreover, we give three sufficient conditions for a graph to be a lower bound

several families of block graphs are lower bound block graphs, including the
level-wise regular block graphs and the extended star of blocks. The line graph
of a graph $G(V,E)$ has $E(G)$ as the vertex set, where two vertices are

non-linear dimensionality reduction that retains meaningful information. The

downstream age regression and sex classification tasks. The results on these
tasks are highly encouraging and a linear regressor trained with the

supervised neural network, trained specifically for age regression on the same

task, to assess its feasibility as a dimensionality reduction method for
neuropsychiatric datasets. These results highlight the potential for
pre-training on a larger set of individuals who do not have mental illness, to
improve the downstream neuropsychiatric task results. The pre-trained model is
fine-tuned for a variable number of epochs on a schizophrenia dataset and we
find that fine-tuning for 1 epoch yields the best results. This work therefore
not only opens up non-linear dimensionality reduction for voxelwise rs-fMRI

also opens up the ability to look at the distribution of rs-fMRI time series in

schizophrenia in future work. This can be complemented with the generative

enforcing network prediction based on important image regions. The proposed
CAMC module highlights the correlated image regions across data and reinforces
the representations in these areas to obtain a better global representation for
classification. Furthermore, we investigate the use of normalized classifiers
for representation learning in long-tailed problems. Our empirical study
demonstrates that by simply scaling the outputs of the classifier with an
appropriate scalar, we can effectively improve the classification accuracy on

states in which some property is not symmetrically distributed. In the case of
strongly correlated electron systems, that were studied by the DFT+U method,
researchers had shown that the total energy of the system is a multi-minima
function of input parameters and one has to single out the ground state out of
the couples of minimum-energy states. However, the methods already introduced
to determine these local minimum states were not able to predict all such
states which may include the ""true"" ground state. In this work, we introduce a
new simple and straight-forward method of SMC to find the GS as well as the
meta-stable states of 1k-order anti-ferromagnetic configuration for UO$_2$.
Using this method, it is shown that the ground state of UO$_2$ system is a
spin-symmetry broken state of the electron spin magnetizations of oxygen atoms.
Depending on the way we apply the SMC method, we obtain different numbers of
meta-stable states, but the same ground states. The energetic properties,
geometric properties, the electronic density distributions, and the electronic
polarization density distributions of the ground state and the meta-stable
states are shown to be different from each other. These properties also are
shown to be sensitive to the magnitude of the initial opposite magnetizations
of U1 and U2 atoms in the 1k-order anti-ferromagnetic configuration, but the
number of meta-stable states as well as the ground-state properties are
insensitive to this magnitude. Using the PBEsol-GGA approximation for the
exchange-correlation we obtain the ground-state properties in excellent
agreement with experiments.

the gap equation at zero and nonzero temperatures. At zero temperature, the
dynamical mass $\bar{m}$ does not depend on the angular frequency, as expected.
We thus study its dependence on the distance $r$ relative to the axis of

effect for various couplings $G$. We then consider the finite temperature case.
The dependence of $\bar{m}$ on the temperature $T$, magnetic field $B$, angular

require full knowledge of the Hilbert space dimension and precise calibration
of measurement devices, which are usually difficult to acquire in an
experiment. The most radical way to overcome these problems is to detect
entanglement solely based on the Bell-like correlations of measurement outcomes
collected in the experiment, namely, device-independently (DI). However, it is
difficult to certify genuine entanglement of practical multipartite states in
this way, and even more difficult to quantify it, due to the difficulty to
identify optimal multipartite Bell inequalities and protocols tolerant to state
impurity. In this work, we explore a general and robust DI method which can be

allows us both to certify the presence of genuine multipartite entanglement and

ferromagnetic (FM) thin film in contact with a nonmagnetic (NM) metal. The
propagation of an ultrafast spin current into NM metal has recently been found
in experiments to generate transient spin accumulation. Unlike spin
accumulation in equilibrium NM metals that occurs due to spin transport at the
Fermi energy, transient spin accumulation involves highly nonequilibrium hot
electrons well above the Fermi level. To date, the diffusion and dissipation of
this transient spin accumulation has not been well studied. Using the
superdiffusive spin transport model, we demonstrate how spin accumulation is
generated in NM metals after laser excitation in an FM|NM bilayer. The spin
accumulation shows an exponential decay from the FM|NM interface, with the
decay length increasing to the maximum value and then decreasing until
saturation. By analyzing the ultrafast dynamics of laser-excited hot electrons,
the ""effective mean free path"", which can be characterized by the averaged

However, there is still a long way to go before drones are capable enough to be

involved in taking care of position estimation, route planning, software/data
security, and collision avoidance to have autonomous drones that fly in
civilian spaces without being harmful to themselves, other UAVs, environment,

can happen during a drone's flight/mission. The analysis of historical data is
also a relevant instrument to help to characterize the most frequent and

  Discretization and Direct Solution Strategies",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We consider the multidimensional space-fractional diffusion equations with
spatially varying diffusivity and fractional order. Significant computational
challenges are encountered when solving these equations due both to the kernel
singularity in the fractional integral operator and to the resulting dense
discretized operators, which quickly become prohibitively expensive to handle
because of their memory and arithmetic complexities.
  In this work, we present a singularity-aware discretization scheme that
regularizes the singular integrals through a singularity subtraction technique
adapted to the spatial variability of diffusivity and fractional order. This
regularization strategy is conveniently formulated as a sparse matrix
correction that is added to the dense operator, and is applicable to different
formulations of fractional diffusion equations. We also present a block low
rank representation to handle the dense matrix representations, by exploiting
the ability to approximate blocks of the resulting formally dense matrix by low
rank factorizations. A Cholesky factorization solver operates directly on this
representation using the low rank blocks as its atomic computational tiles, and
achieves high performance on multicore hardware.
  Numerical results show that the singularity treatment is robust,
substantially reduces discretization errors, and attains the first-order
convergence rate allowed by the regularity of the solutions. They also show
that considerable savings are obtained in storage ($O(N^{1.5})$) and
computational cost ($O(N^2)$) compared to dense factorizations. This translates
to orders-of-magnitude savings in memory and time on multi-dimensional
problems, and shows that the proposed methods offer practical tools for
tackling large nonlocal fractional diffusion simulations.

leads to structures having residual shear stress. The origin of these states
and the distribution of the local shear stresses within the material is not
well understood, despite its importance for the change in material properties

simulations of a model dense non-Brownian soft amorphous material to probe the
non-trivial relaxation process towards a residual stress state. We find that,
similar to thermal glasses, an increase in shear rate prior to the shear
cessation leads to lower residual stress states. We rationalise our findings
using a mesoscopic elasto-plastic description that explicitly includes a long
range elastic response to local shear transformations. We find that after flow
cessation the initial stress relaxation indeed depends on the pre-sheared
stress state, but the final residual stress is majorly determined by newly
activated plastic events occurring during the relaxation process. Our
simplified coarse grained description not only allows to capture the
phenomenology of residual stress states but also to rationalise the altered

challenging task for many applications such as Simultaneous Localization and
Mapping (SLAM). Taking the task as a point cloud retrieval problem, previous
methods have made delightful achievements. However, how to deal with
catastrophic collapse caused by rotation problems is still under-explored. In
this paper, to tackle the issue, we propose a novel Point Cloud-based
Rotation-aware Large Scale Place Recognition Network (RPR-Net). In particular,
to solve the problem, we propose to learn rotation-invariant features in three
steps. First, we design three kinds of novel Rotation-Invariant Features
(RIFs), which are low-level features that can hold the rotation-invariant
property. Second, using these RIFs, we design an attentive module to learn
rotation-invariant kernels. Third, we apply these kernels to previous point
cloud features to generate new features, which is the well-known SO(3) mapping
process. By doing so, high-level scene-specific rotation-invariant features can
be learned. We call the above process an Attentive Rotation-Invariant
Convolution (ARIConv). To achieve the place recognition goal, we build RPR-Net,
which takes ARIConv as a basic unit to construct a dense network architecture.
Then, powerful global descriptors used for retrieval-based place recognition
can be sufficiently extracted from RPR-Net. Experimental results on prevalent
datasets show that our method achieves comparable results to existing
state-of-the-art place recognition models and significantly outperforms other
rotation-invariant baseline models when solving rotation problems.

  Proceedings- EDCC 2021",,,,"cs.CR cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The spread of ransomware continues to cause devastation and is a major
concern for the security community. An often-used technique against this threat
is the use of honey (or canary) files, which serve as ``trip wires'' to detect
ransomware in its early stages. However, in our analysis of ransomware samples
from the wild, we discovered that attackers are well-aware of these traps, and
newer variants use several evasive strategies to bypass traditional honey
files. Hence, we present the design of SentryFS - a specialized file system
that strategically ``sprays'' specially-crafted honey files across the file
system. The canaries are generated using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and
the content and the metadata is constantly updated to make the canaries appear
more attractive for smarter ransomware that is selective in choosing victim
files. Furthermore, to assist with the management of the honey files, SentryFS
connects with an anti-ransomware web service to download the latest
intelligence on novel ransomware strategies to update the canaries. Finally, as
a contingency, SentryFS also leverages file clones to prevent processes from
writing to files directly in the event a highly stealthy ransomware goes
undetected. In this case, the ransomware encrypts the clones rather than the
actual files, leaving users' data unmodified. An AI agent then assigns a
suspicion score to the write activity so that users can approve/discard the
changes. As an early-warning system, the proposed design might help mitigate
the problem of ransomware.

of magnetic fields in ellipticals via two methods. First, we exploit the
Laing-Garrington effect (asymmetry in the observed polarization fraction
between radio galaxy jets) for 57 galaxies with redshifts up to $0.5$. We use
the differences in polarization fraction and rotation measure between the jet
and counterjet to estimate the small- and large-scale magnetic fields in and
around ellipticals (including their circumgalactic medium). We find that the
small-scale field (at scales smaller than the driving scale of turbulence,
approximately $300~{\rm pc}$) lies in the range $0.1~\text{--}~2.75~\mu{\rm
G}$. The large-scale field (at scales of $100~{\rm kpc}$) is an order of
magnitude smaller than the small-scale field. In the second method, we
cross-match the Faraday rotation measures (RM) of a few hundred (out of $3098$)
extragalactic radio sources with galaxy catalogs to explore the effect of the
number and morphology of intervening galaxies on the observed RM distribution.
We use both Gaussian and non-Gaussian functions to describe the RM distribution
and derive its statistical properties. Finally, using the difference in the
observed polarization fraction between the intervening spirals and ellipticals,
we estimate the small-scale magnetic fields at the center of ellipticals to be
$\sim6~\mu{\rm G}$. Both methods with different observations and analysis
techniques give magnetic field strengths consistent with previous studies
($\leq10\mu{\rm G}$), and the results can be used to constrain dynamo theories

for a single-input single-output networked linear feedback system. The control
signal in the networked system is transmitted over an unreliable channel. In
this unreliable channel, the data transmission times, referred to as channel
induced delays, are random values and the transmitted data could also be
dropout with certain probability. The channel induced delays and packet dropout
are modeled by an independent and identically distributed stochastic process
with a fixed probability mass function. At the channel terminal, a linear
combination of data received at one sampling time is applied to the plant of
the networked feedback system as a new control signal. To describe the
uncertainty in the channel, a concept so called frequency response of variation
is introduced for the unreliable channel. With the given linear receiving
strategy, a mean-square stability criterion is established in terms of the
frequency response of variation of the unreliable channel for the networked
feedback system. It is shown by this criterion that the mean-square stability
is determined by the interaction between the frequency response of variation
and the nominal feedback system. The role played by the random channel induced
delays is the same as that played by a colored additive noise in an additive
noise channel with a signal-to-noise ratio constraint. Moreover, the
mean-square input-output stabilizability via output feedback is studied for the
networked system. When the plant in the networked feedback system is minimum
phase, an analytic necessary and sufficient condition is presented for its
mean-square input-output stabilizability. It turns out that the stabilizability
is only determined by the interaction between the frequency response of
variation of the channel and unstable poles of the plant.

strategies, e.g., replication packages and families of experiments, have been
proposed to improve replication in ESE, with limited success. We wonder whether
the failures are due to some mismatch, i.e., the researchers' needs are not
satisfied by the proposed replication procedures.
  Objectives: Find out how experimental researchers conduct \textit{experiments
in practice}.
  Methods: We carried out an ethnography study within a SE Research Group. Our
main activity was to observe/approach the experimental researchers in their
day-to-day settings for two years. Their preferred literature and experimental
materials were studied. We used individual and group interviews to gain
understanding and examine unclear topics in-depth.
  Results: We have created conceptual and process models that represent how
experimentation is really conducted in the Research Group. Models fit the

different roles, (3) the granularity of the concepts used by the roles, and (4)
the viewpoints that different sub-areas or families of experiments have about

externalities. Under externalities, the utility an agent obtains depends not
only on its allocation but also on the allocation of other agents. An agent has
a positive (negative) value for the assigned goods (chores). This work focuses
on a special case of externality, i.e., an agent receives positive or negative
value for unassigned items independent of which other agent gets it. We show
that it is possible to adapt existing algorithms using a transformation to
ensure certain fairness and efficiency notions in this setting. Despite the
positive results, fairness notions like proportionality need to be re-defined.
Further, we prove that maximin share (MMS) may not have any multiplicative
approximation in this setting. Studying this domain is a stepping stone towards
full externalities where ensuring fairness is much more challenging.

the worldwide polarized deep inelastic scattering data, based on the dynamical
parton distribution model. All the sea quarks and gluons are dynamically
generated from QCD radiations, with the nonperturbative input contains only the
polarized valence quark distributions. This approach leads to a simple
parametrization, which has only four free parameters. In the analysis, we apply
the DGLAP equations with parton-parton recombination corrections. The
parameterized nonperturbative input at an extremely low $Q_0^2$ reproduces well
the spin-dependent structure functions measured at high $Q^{2}$. Comparisons
with experimental observations and some other polarized parton distribution
functions are also shown. Our results are in good agreement with the
experimental data and consistent with some other parameterized models.
Furthermore, our analysis gives the positive polarized gluon distribution and
it suggests that the gluon distribution plays an important role to the proton
spin content. The polarized antiquark distributions are non-zero at high $Q^2$
but quite small compared to polarized valence quark distribution, based on this
dynamical parton model analysis. This analysis shows smaller statistical
uncertainties for the polarized sea quark and gluon distributions, thanks to
the fewer free parameters used for the parametrization of the initial polarized
PDFs.

congestion issues. Identifying the type of airplane, on the other hand, will
entirely fix the problem because it will offer important information about the
plane's technical specifications (i.e., the time it needs to be served and its

contributions to address airport traffic jams; however, their ultimate goal was
to determine the existence of airplane objects. This paper provides a practical
approach to identify the type of airplane in airports depending on the results
provided by the airplane detection process using mask region convolution neural

surface area calculated based on the results of airplane detection. The surface
area is used to assess the estimated cabin length which is considered as an
additional key feature for identifying the airplane type. The length of any
detected plane may be calculated by measuring the distance between the detected
plane's two furthest points. The suggested approach's performance is assessed
using average accuracies and a confusion matrix. The findings show that this

to the interference among different child models caused by weight sharing. In
this paper, we investigate the interference issue by sampling different child
models and calculating the gradient similarity of shared operators, and
observe: 1) the interference on a shared operator between two child models is
positively correlated with the number of different operators; 2) the
interference is smaller when the inputs and outputs of the shared operator are
more similar. Inspired by these two observations, we propose two approaches to
mitigate the interference: 1) MAGIC-T: rather than randomly sampling child
models for optimization, we propose a gradual modification scheme by modifying
one operator between adjacent optimization steps to minimize the interference
on the shared operators; 2) MAGIC-A: forcing the inputs and outputs of the
operator across all child models to be similar to reduce the interference.

novel mechanism to automatically learn the relevance of each sentence in a
corpus to sentiment-bearing topics extracted from that corpus. The extractive
approach uses a sentence ranking algorithm for label selection which for the
first time jointly optimises topic--sentence relevance as well as
aspect--sentiment co-coverage. The abstractive approach instead addresses
aspect--sentiment co-coverage by using sentence fusion to generate a sentential
label that includes relevant content from multiple sentences. To our knowledge,
we are the first to study the problem of labelling sentiment-bearing topics.
Our experimental results on three real-world datasets show that both the
extractive and abstractive approaches outperform four strong baselines in terms
of facilitating topic understanding and interpretation. In addition, when
comparing extractive and abstractive labels, our evaluation shows that our best
performing abstractive method is able to provide more topic information
coverage in fewer words, at the cost of generating less grammatical labels than
the extractive method. We conclude that abstractive methods can effectively
synthesise the rich information contained in sentiment-bearing topics.

otherwise limited coverage. In this article, application use cases of
RIS-enhanced vehicular communications are proposed. Beside static deployments
of RISs at exterior walls of buildings, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) could
provide reflection capabilities on demand, while future vehicles could - in a
visionary approach - consist of meta-material allowing for their opportunistic
utilization within an enriched SRE. Results of a case study based on our
multi-scale mobility and network simulation model clearly highlight the
potential of RIS deployment for hybrid vehicular communication scenarios. Path

  figures. This is followed by Russian text in the 30 pages, 3 figures",,,,"cond-mat.supr-con cond-mat.other","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The article formulates the basic principles of microscopic physics of a
macroscopic ensemble of interacting helium-4 atoms. The concept of a vortex
field is introduced, which is caused by the motion of the particles of the
electron and nuclear subsystems of atoms of the macrosystem relative to each
other. It is assumed that helium-4 atoms ""immersed"" in the internal vortex
field acquire the properties of fermionic particles due to the atomic
pseudospins s=1/2 generated by the vortex. On this basis, a heuristic
evolutionary model of helium-4 as an ensemble of atom-like quasiparticles with
fermionic properties is constructed. As the temperature decreases, bonds are
formed between pseudofermionic quasiparticles by pairing their pseudospins. The
formation of a hierarchy of composite quasiparticles on this basis leads to the
transition of helium-4 atoms from the gas phase to the liquid state, then to
the state of incoherent Bose condensate, and finally to the state with a
long-range order of atom-like quasiparticles. The structural forms of composite
quasiparticles in different phases, the mechanisms of their formation, and the
temperatures of these phase transitions ($T_{cr}=5.22K$, $T_0=4.14K$ and
$T_\lambda=2.175K$, respectively) are determined. The ideas and calculations
presented in this paper form the basis for solving the problem of the
temperature dependence of the heat capacity of liquid helium-4 in both the
helium-I and helium-II phases. The obtained solution has a logarithmic
dependence of the heat capacity on the reduced temperature
(${|1-{T/T_\lambda}|}$) in the region of the $\lambda$-point of the phase
transition of helium-4 from a disordered to an ordered state. The numerical
calculations of the heat capacity in the vicinity of the temperature
$T_\lambda$ are in very good agreement with the experimental data.

functional vanishes provided for the gauge parameters are restricted by the
differential equations. The unfree gauge symmetry is shown to lead to the
global conserved quantities whose on shell values are defined by the
asymptotics of the fields or data on the lower dimension surface, or even at
the point of the space-time, rather than Cauchy hyper-surface. The most known
example of such quantity is the cosmological constant of unimodular gravity.
More examples are provided in the article for the higher spin gravity analogues
of the cosmological constant. Any action enjoying the unfree gauge symmetry is
demonstrated to admit the alternative form of gauge symmetry with the higher
order derivatives of unrestricted gauge parameters. The higher order gauge
symmetry is reducible in general, even if the unfree symmetry is not. The
relationship is detailed between these two forms of gauge symmetry in the
constrained Hamiltonian formalism. The local map is shown to exist from the
unfree gauge algebra to the reducible higher order one, while the inverse map
is non-local, in general. The Hamiltonian BFV-BRST formalism is studied for
both forms of the gauge symmetry. These two Hamiltonian formalisms are shown
connected by canonical transformation involving the ghosts. The generating
function is local for the transformation, though the transformation as such is
not local, in general. Hence, these two local BRST complexes are not
quasi-isomorphic in the sense that their local BRST-cohomology groups can be
different. This difference in particular concerns the global conserved
quantities. From the standpoint of the BRST complex for unfree gauge symmetry,
these quantities are BRST-exact, while for the alternative complex, these

(NHSE), which is known to break the bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC), emerges
in the system only when the non-Hermiticity induces certain unbalanced

found to be more sophisticated than that of its Hermitian counterpart, whether
with or without the NHSE. In one scenario without the NHSE, the topological
winding is found to exist in a two-dimensional plane embedded in a
four-dimensional space of the complex Hamiltonian vector. The NHSE itself also
possesses some unusual behaviors in this system, including a high spectral
winding without the presence of long-range hoppings, and a competition between
two types of the NHSE, with the same and opposite inverse localization lengths
for the two bands, respectively. Furthermore, it is found that the NHSE in this

statistical homogeneity between some trigger words and target event types,
which we summarize as trigger overlapping and trigger separability. The biases
can result in context-bypassing problem, i.e., correct classifications can be
gained by looking at only the trigger words while ignoring the entire context.
Therefore, existing models can be weak in generalizing to unseen data in real
scenarios. To further uncover the trigger biases and assess the generalization
ability of the models, we propose two new sampling methods, Trigger-Uniform

an image contain to represent the 'content' of the Eiffel Tower? What visual
elements of 'The Starry Night' are caused by van Gogh's 'style' rather than his
decision to depict a village under the night sky? Precisely defining 'content'
and 'style' is a central challenge of designing algorithms for artistic style
transfer, algorithms which can recreate photographs using an artwork's style.
My efforts defining these terms, and designing style transfer algorithms
themselves, are the focus of this thesis. I will begin by proposing novel
definitions of style and content based on optimal transport and
self-similarity, and demonstrating how a style transfer algorithm based on
these definitions generates outputs with improved visual quality. Then I will
describe how the traditional texture-based definition of style can be expanded
to include elements of geometry and proportion by jointly optimizing a
keypoint-guided deformation field alongside the stylized output's pixels.
Finally I will describe a framework inspired by both modern neural style
transfer algorithms and traditional patch-based synthesis approaches which is
fast, general, and offers state-of-the-art visual quality.

i.e. the smallest (cardinal) number of proper subspaces whose union covers $V$.
Analogously, define $\sigma(M,R)$ for a module $M$ over a unital commutative
ring $R$; this includes the covering numbers of Abelian groups, which are
extensively studied in the literature. Recently, Khare-Tikaradze [Comm.
Algebra, in press] showed for several classes of rings $R$ and $R$-modules $M$
that $\sigma(M,R)=\min_{\mathfrak{m}\in S_M} |R/\mathfrak{m}| + 1$, where $S_M$
is the set of maximal ideals $\mathfrak{m}$ such that
$\dim_{R/\mathfrak{m}}(M/\mathfrak{m}M)\geq 2$. (That
$\sigma(M,R)\leq\min_{\mathfrak{m}\in S_M}|R/\mathfrak{m}|+1$ is
straightforward.) Our first main result extends this equality to all
$R$-modules with small Jacobson radical and finite dual Goldie dimension.
  We next introduce a topological counterpart for finitely generated
$R$-modules $M$ over rings $R$, whose 'some' residue fields are infinite, which
we call the Zariski covering number $\sigma_\tau(M,R)$. To do so, we first
define the ""induced Zariski topology"" $\tau$ on $M$, and now define
$\sigma_\tau(M,R)$ to be the smallest (cardinal) number of proper $\tau$-closed
subsets of $M$ whose union covers $M$. We first show that our choice of
topology implies that $\sigma_\tau(M,R)\leq\sigma(M,R)$, the covering number.
  We then show our next main result: $\sigma_\tau(M,R)=\min_{\mathfrak{m}\in
S_M} |R/\mathfrak{m}|+1$, for all finitely generated $R$-modules $M$ for which
(a) the dual Goldie dimension is finite, and (b) $\mathfrak{m}\notin S_M$
whenever $R/\mathfrak{m}$ is finite. As a corollary, this alternately recovers
the above formula for the covering number $\sigma(M,R)$ of the aforementioned
finitely generated modules. We also extend these topological studies to general
finitely generated $R$-modules, using the notion of $\kappa$-Baire spaces.

diverse shapes formed by discrete points. In this paper, we propose
PointSeaConv, i.e., a novel differential convolution search paradigm on point

auto-creating a group of suitable convolutions for geometric shape modeling. We
also propose a joint optimization framework for simultaneous search of internal
convolution and external architecture, and introduce epsilon-greedy algorithm
to alleviate the effect of discretization error. As a result, PointSeaNet, a
deep network that is sufficient to capture geometric shapes at both convolution

Extensive experiments strongly evidence that our proposed PointSeaNet surpasses

MDD-KM provides uncertainty quantification and can be deployed to build
classification systems for the realistic scenario where out-of-distribution
(OOD) samples are present among the test data. Given a test signal, a quantity
related to empirical kernel Mahalanobis distance between the signal and each of
the training classes is computed. Since these quantities correspond to the same
reproducing kernel Hilbert space, they are commensurable and hence can be
readily treated as classification scores without further application of fusion
techniques. To set kernel parameters, we exploit the fact that predictive
variance according to a Gaussian process (GP) is empirical kernel Mahalanobis
distance when a centralized kernel is used, and propose to use GP's negative
likelihood function as the cost function. We conduct experiments on the real
problem of avian note classification. We report a prototypical classification
system based on a hierarchical linear dynamical system with MDD-KM as a

of sediments across extremely long distances and cause tsunamis and damages to
offshore structures. This paper uses the granular column collapse experiment to
investigate the effect of slope angle on the runout behavior of submarine
granular landslides for different initial volumes. A two-dimensional coupled
lattice Boltzman and discrete element method (LBM-DEM) approach is adopted for
numerically modeling the granular column collapse. Columns with four different
slope angles and six different volumes are modelled under both dry and
submerged conditions. The effects of hydrodynamic interactions, including the
generation of excess pore pressures, hydroplaning, and drag forces and
formation of turbulent vortices, are used to explain the difference in the
runout behavior of the submerged columns compared to the dry columns. The
results show that at any given slope angle, there is a threshold volume above
which the submerged columns have a larger final runout compared to their dry
counterpart, and this threshold volume decreases with slope angle.

well-labeled source domain to a different but related unlabeled target domain
with identical label space. Currently, the main workhorse for solving UDA is
domain alignment, which has proven successful. However, it is often difficult
to find an appropriate source domain with identical label space. A more
practical scenario is so-called partial domain adaptation (PDA) in which the
source label set or space subsumes the target one. Unfortunately, in PDA, due
to the existence of the irrelevant categories in the source domain, it is quite
hard to obtain a perfect alignment, thus resulting in mode collapse and
negative transfer. Although several efforts have been made by down-weighting
the irrelevant source categories, the strategies used tend to be burdensome and
risky since exactly which irrelevant categories are unknown. These challenges
motivate us to find a relatively simpler alternative to solve PDA. To achieve
this, we first provide a thorough theoretical analysis, which illustrates that
the target risk is bounded by both model smoothness and between-domain
discrepancy. Considering the difficulty of perfect alignment in solving PDA, we
turn to focus on the model smoothness while discard the riskier domain
alignment to enhance the adaptability of the model. Specifically, we
instantiate the model smoothness as a quite simple intra-domain structure
preserving (IDSP). To our best knowledge, this is the first naive attempt to
address the PDA without domain alignment. Finally, our empirical results on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that IDSP is not only superior to the
PDA SOTAs by a significant margin on some benchmarks (e.g., +10% on Cl->Rw and
+8% on Ar->Rw ), but also complementary to domain alignment in the standard UDA

model directly in the untargeted attack or with little fine-tune in the
targeted attack, which saves computation time. A range of empirical results on

Century, assume its universal validity, and try to derive its consequences.
Spacetime, with its locality, cannot be fundamental, but emergent from
entangled coherent quantum variables and their behaviors. Two consequences: i.
If we start with non-locality, we need not explain non-locality. We must
explain an emergence of locality and spacetime. ii. There can be no emergence
of spacetime without matter. This contradicts General Relativity, which is
local, formulatable without matter and without an emergence of spacetime.
Quantum gravity cannot be a minor alteration of General Relativity. This will
lead to: Matter not only deforms spacetime, but creates spacetime. This quantum
creation of spacetime consists in: i. Fully non-local entangled coherent
quantum variables. ii. The onset of locality via decoherence. iii. A metric in
Hilbert Space among entangled quantum variables. iv. Mapping from metric
distances in Hilbert Space to metric distances in classical spacetime by
episodic actualization events. v. Discrete spacetime is the relations among
these discrete actualization events. vi. ""Now"" is the shared moment of
actualization of one among the entangled variables. vii. The discrete,
successive, episodic, irreversible actualization events constitute a quantum
arrow of time. viii. The arrow of time history of these events is recorded in
the very structure of the spacetime constructed. ix. Actual Time is a
succession of two or more actual events. Relation to Causal Set Theory,
faithful Lorentzian manifolds and light cones are discussed. The theory
inevitably yields a UV cut off. The cut off is a phase transition between
continuous spacetime before the transition and discontinuous spacetime beyond
the phase transition. This may predict the knee and ankle of the gamma ray

Opt. 61, 629-637 (2022)","10.1364/AO.439762",,"physics.app-ph physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In this paper, a novel coarse-to-fine optical MEMS accelerometer based on the
Fabry Perot (FP) interferometer is proposed. The mechanical structure consists
of a proof mass that is suspended by four L-shaped springs. The deflection of
the proof mass due to the applied acceleration is detected using two FP
cavities which comprise the optical system of the device. Using coarse-to-fine
measurement and the dual-wavelength method increases the sensitivity of the
accelerometer as well as the linear measurement range simultaneously. The
optical simulation shows that the sensitivity of the proposed device is 10
times as high as that of a similar optical MEMS accelerometer with one FP
cavity. In addition, the proposed optical system is insensitive to the
displacements of the proof mass in orthogonal directions as a result of which
cross-axis sensitivity is considerably reduced. The minimum feature size of the
structure is 15 um and the optical signal is conducted completely through the
optical fibers, facilitating the fabrication of the device. The simulation
results are as follows: mechanical sensitivity of 190 nm/g, optical sensitivity
of 8 nm/g, linear measurement of 5 g, and first resonance frequency of 1141 Hz.

impact of index futures trading on spot price variability. We discuss the
CSI-300 index (China-Shanghai-Shenzhen-300-Stock Index) as a test case. The
results prove that the introduction of CSI-300 index futures (CSI-300-IF)
trading significantly reduces the volatility in the corresponding spot market.
It is also found that there is a stationary equilibrium relationship between
the CSI-300 spot and CCSI-300-IF markets. A bidirectional Granger causality is
also detected. ''Finally'', it is deduced that spot prices are predicted with
greater accuracy over a 3 or 4 lag day time span.

  Media",,,,,"cs.CL cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the development of social media, social communication has changed. While
this facilitates people's communication and access to information, it also
provides an ideal platform for spreading rumors. In normal or critical
situations, rumors will affect people's judgment and even endanger social
security. However, natural language is high-dimensional and sparse, and the
same rumor may be expressed in hundreds of ways on social media. As such, the
robustness and generalization of the current rumor detection model are put into
question. We proposed a novel \textbf{h}ierarchical \textbf{a}dversarial
\textbf{t}raining method for \textbf{r}umor \textbf{d}etection (HAT4RD) on
social media. Specifically, HAT4RD is based on gradient ascent by adding
adversarial perturbations to the embedding layers of post-level and event-level
modules to deceive the detector. At the same time, the detector uses stochastic
gradient descent to minimize the adversarial risk to learn a more robust model.
In this way, the post-level and event-level sample spaces are enhanced, and we
have verified the robustness of our model under a variety of adversarial
attacks. Moreover, visual experiments indicate that the proposed model drifts
into an area with a flat loss landscape, leading to better generalization. We
evaluate our proposed method on three public rumors datasets from two commonly
used social platforms (Twitter and Weibo). Experiment results demonstrate that
our model achieves better results than state-of-the-art methods.

large expensive annotated video regions paired with language queries. To
eliminate the annotation costs, we make a first attempt to train a natural
language video localization model in zero-shot manner. Inspired by unsupervised
image captioning setup, we merely require random text corpora, unlabeled video
collections, and an off-the-shelf object detector to train a model. With the
unpaired data, we propose to generate pseudo-supervision of candidate temporal
regions and corresponding query sentences, and develop a simple NLVL model to
train with the pseudo-supervision. Our empirical validations show that the
proposed pseudo-supervised method outperforms several baseline approaches and a
number of methods using stronger supervision on Charades-STA and
ActivityNet-Captions.

  Models",,,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  The recent development in pretrained language models trained in a
self-supervised fashion, such as BERT, is driving rapid progress in the field
of NLP. However, their brilliant performance is based on leveraging syntactic
artifacts of the training data rather than fully understanding the intrinsic
meaning of language. The excessive exploitation of spurious artifacts causes a
problematic issue: The distribution collapse problem, which is the phenomenon
that the model fine-tuned on downstream tasks is unable to distinguish
out-of-distribution (OOD) sentences while producing a high confidence score. In
this paper, we argue that distribution collapse is a prevalent issue in
pretrained language models and propose noise entropy regularisation (NoiER) as
an efficient learning paradigm that solves the problem without auxiliary models
and additional~data. The proposed approach improved traditional OOD detection
evaluation metrics by 55% on average compared to the original fine-tuned
models.

train explainable language processing models for
commonsense-knowledge-requiring tasks. The most predominant form of these
models is the explain-then-predict (EtP) structure, which first generates
explanations and uses them for making decisions. The performance of EtP models
is highly dependent on that of the explainer by the nature of their structure.
Therefore, large-sized explanation data are required to train a good explainer
model. However, annotating explanations is expensive. Also, recent works reveal
that free-text explanations might not convey sufficient information for
decision making. These facts cast doubts on the effectiveness of EtP models. In
this paper, we argue that the predict-then-explain (PtE) architecture is a more
efficient approach in terms of the modelling perspective. Our main contribution
is twofold. First, we show that the PtE structure is the most data-efficient
approach when explanation data are lacking. Second, we reveal that the PtE
structure is always more training-efficient than the EtP structure. We also
provide experimental results that confirm the theoretical advantages.
