of using boundary control alone to optimize mixing in Stokes flows. The
theoretical foundation including mathematical model and the optimality
conditions for solving the optimal control has been established by Hu and Wu in
a series of work. The scalar being mixed is purely advected by the flow and the
control is exerted tangentially on the domain boundary through the Navier slip
conditions. The control design is motivated by the physical observations that
the moving or rotating walls accelerate mixing.
  A gradient descent-based optimization algorithm is designed. A critical
problem is the computation of the Gateaux derivative or the gradient of the
cost functional. Two methods are proposed: one is based on the Variational
Formula (VF) and one utilizes Algorithmic Differentiation (AD). The convergence
of the algorithm is studied and various designs of boundary control using
cosine and sine functions with time segmentation are computed.
  The algorithm has a first order convergence rate and the VF method is more
efficient by taking only one third of the time as the AD method when the
dimension of control basis is large. The numerical implementations show that
the boundary control produces similar mixing results as internal mixings in the
existing literature. The mixing effect becomes better when more diverse basis
control functions and more time segmentation are utilized. It is shown that the
mixing decay rate in time follows power rules, approximately. The numerical
study in this work suggests that boundary control alone could be an effective
strategy for mixing in incompressible fluid flows.

in a fast, precise, non-intrusive, and non-disruptive way remains challenging.
Several factors can cause cybersickness, and their identification will help
find its origins and prevent or minimize it. One such factor is virtual
movement. Movement, whether physical or virtual, can be represented in
different forms. One way to represent and store it is with a temporally
annotated point sequence. Because a sequence is memory-consuming, it is often
preferable to save it in a compressed form. Compression allows redundant data
to be eliminated while still preserving changes in speed and direction. Since
changes in direction and velocity in VR can be associated with cybersickness,
changes in compression rate can likely indicate changes in cybersickness
levels. In this research, we explore whether quantifying changes in virtual
movement can be used to estimate variation in cybersickness levels of VR users.
We investigate the correlation between changes in the compression rate of
movement data in two VR games with changes in players' cybersickness levels
captured during gameplay. Our results show (1) a clear correlation between
changes in compression rate and cybersickness, and(2) that a machine learning
approach can be used to identify these changes. Finally, results from a second

investigate the spin polarization of antiferromagnetic ANMn$_3$ metals using
first-principles density functional theory calculations. We find that the spin

that in widely used ferromagnetic metals, and thus can be exploited in magnetic
tunnel junctions and spin transfer torque devices. Moreover, for certain film

complement to modeling by helping guide assumptions about generative processes
and their representation in the data. Dimensionality reduction (DR) is a
frequently implemented type of characterization designed to mitigate the ""curse
of dimensionality"" on high-D signals. For decades, Principal Component (PC) and
Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis has been used as a linear,
invertible approach to DR and ST analysis. Recent years have seen the
additional development of a suite of nonlinear DR algorithms, frequently
categorized as ""manifold learning"". Here, we explore the idea of joint
characterization of ST data manifolds using PCs/EOFs alongside two nonlinear DR
approaches: Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor
embedding (t-SNE). Starting with a synthetic example and progressing to global,
regional, and field scale ST datasets spanning roughly 5 orders of magnitude in
space and 2 in time, we show these three DR approaches can yield complementary
information about ST manifold topology. Compared to the relatively diffuse TFS
produced by PCs/EOFs, the nonlinear approaches yield more compact manifolds
with decreased ambiguity in temporal endmembers (LE) and/or in spatiotemporal
clustering (t-SNE). These properties are compensated by the greater
interpretability, significantly lower computational demand and diminished
sensitivity to spatial aliasing for PCs/EOFs than LE or t-SNE. Taken together,
we find joint characterization using the three complementary DR approaches
capable of greater insight into generative ST processes than possible using any
single approach alone.

numbers of the flow are 300 and 500. The porous medium consists of solid
obstacles in the shape of square and circular cylinders. Two distinct flow
regimes are represented by using the porosities of 0.50 and 0.87. The results
show that the surface Nusselt number distribution is dependent on whether the
micro-vortices are attached to or detached from the surface of the obstacle.
The spectra of the macroscale Nusselt number and the pressure drag are similar
signifying a correlation between the dynamics of heat transfer and the
microscale turbulent structures. Both vortex shedding and secondary flow
instabilities are observed that significantly influence the Nusselt number. The
fundamental insight gained in this paper can inform the development of more
robust macroscale models of convection heat transfer in turbulent flow in
porous media.

increasingly discussed and studied as their activation would impose a

far. Here we illustrate how different patterns of multiple tipping dynamics
emerge from a very simple coupling of two previously studied idealized tipping
elements. In particular, we distinguish between a two phase cascade, a domino
cascade and a joint cascade. While a mitigation of an unfolding two phase
cascade may be possible and common early warning indicators are sensitive to
upcoming critical transitions to a certain degree, the domino cascade may
hardly be stopped once initiated and critical slowing down--based indicators
fail to indicate tipping of the following element. These different potentials
for intervention and anticipation across the distinct patterns of multiple
tipping dynamics should be seen as a call to be more precise in future analyses
on cascading dynamics arising from tipping element interactions in the Earth

compressive phenomena and large amplitude fluctuations with a dominant
Alfv\'enic character;a rarefaction region characterized by a decreasing trend

some cases the region where the severe reduction of these fluctuations takes
place is remarkably short in time, of the order of minutes, and located at the
flow velocity knee separating the fast wind plateau from the rarefaction

mechanisms that might be at the origin of this phenomenon. We firstly looked
for the presence of any tangential discontinuity which might inhibit the
propagation of Alfv\'enic fluctuations from fast wind region to rarefaction

between these two regions led us to proceed with ion composition analysis for
the corresponding solar wind, looking for any abrupt variation in minor ions
parameters (as tracers of the source region) which might be linked to the
phenomenon observed in the wind fluctuations. In the lack of a positive
feedback from this analysis, we finally propose a mechanism based on
interchange reconnection experienced by the field lines at the base of the

minimize this impact, policy makers undertake containment measures that

to consider the localized sensitivities in small regions. Hence, the need
arises for region-wise threat assessments that provide insights on the
behaviour of COVID-19 through time, enabled through accurate forecasts. In this
study, a forecasting solution is proposed, to predict daily new cases of
COVID-19 in regions small enough where containment measures could be locally
implemented, by targeting three main shortcomings that exist in literature; the
unreliability of existing data caused by inconsistent testing patterns in
smaller regions, weak deploy-ability of forecasting models towards predicting
cases in previously unseen regions, and model training biases caused by the
imbalanced nature of data in COVID-19 epi-curves. Hence, the contributions of
this study are three-fold; an optimized smoothing technique to smoothen less
deterministic epi-curves based on epidemiological dynamics of that region, a
Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) based forecasting model trained using data from
select regions to create a representative and diverse training set that
maximizes deploy-ability in regions with lack of historical data, and an
adaptive loss function whilst training to mitigate the data imbalances seen in
epi-curves. The proposed smoothing technique, the generalized training strategy
and the adaptive loss function largely increased the overall accuracy of the
forecast, which enables efficient containment measures at a more localized

detail the propagation of metric perturbations on a Schwarzschild-de Sitter

they are very small for the distances considered in pulsar timing arrays but

software organizations, different scenarios struggle to make it scales for
their products in long-term evolution. This study looks at the concrete
software architecture as a relevant factor for successfully achieving
continuous delivery goals. Objective: This study aims to understand how the
design of software architectures impacts the continuous deployment of their
software product. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review to
identify proper evidence regarding the research objective. We analyzed the
selected sources adopting a synthesis and analysis approach based on Grounded
Theory. Results: We selected 14 primary sources. Through our analysis process,
we developed a theory that explains the phenomenon of Architecting for
Continuous Deployment. The theory describes three other phenomena that support
Architecting for Continuous Deployment: Supporting Operations, Continuous
Evolution, and Improving Deployability. Furthermore, the theory comprises the
following elements: contexts, actions and interactions, quality attributes,
principles, and effects. We instantiated these elements and identified their
interrelationships. The theory is supported by providing bi-directional
traceability from the selected sources to the elements and vice-versa.
Conclusions: Developing adequate architecture plays a crucial role in enabling
continuous delivery. Supporting operations becomes vital to increase the
deployability and monitorability of software architecture. These two outcomes
require that developers accept responsibility for maintaining the operations.
The continuous evolution of the architecture is essential, but it must consider
balanced management of technical debt. Finally, improving deployability
requires attention to the test strategy and how it affects downtime to enable
efficient pipelines.

back-end automation tasks. On top of JavaScript and Python, there are several
frameworks to facilitate automation tasks further. Some of these frameworks are
Node Manager Package (npm) and Python Package Index (PyPi), which are open
source (OS) package libraries. The public registries npm and PyPi use to host
packages allow any user with a verified email to publish code. The lack of a
comprehensive scanning tool when publishing to the registry creates security
concerns. Users can report malicious code on the registry; however, attackers
can still cause damage until they remove their tool from the platform.
Furthermore, several packages depend on each other, making them more vulnerable
to a bad package in the dependency tree. The heavy code reuse creates security
artifacts developers have to consider, such as the package reach. This project
will illustrate a high-level overview of common risks associated with OS
registries and the package dependency structure. There are several attack
types, such as typosquatting and combosquatting, in the OS package registries.
Outdated packages pose a security risk, and we will examine the extent of
technical lag present in the npm environment. In this paper, our main
contribution consists of a survey of common threats in OS registries.
Afterward, we will offer countermeasures to mitigate the risks presented. These
remedies will heavily focus on the applications of Machine Learning (ML) to
detect suspicious activities. To the best of our knowledge, the ML-focused
countermeasures are the first proposed possible solutions to the security
problems listed. In addition, this project is the first survey of threats in
npm and PyPi, although several studies focus on a subset of threats.

window onto the deformation of nuclei has been recently opened with the
realization that nuclear collision experiments performed at high-energy

atomize high-viscosity fluid at high flow rate into fine aerosol mists of

atomization process is not well understood. It is found that with low power the
droplet vibrates at low frequency (O[100 Hz]) when driven by high-frequency
ultrasound (O[1 MHz] and above). To study the mechanism of the energy transfer
that spans these vastly different timescales, we measure the droplet's
interfacial response to 6.6~MHz ultrasound excitation using high-speed digital
holography. We show that the onset of low-frequency capillary waves is driven
by feedback interplay between the acoustic radiation pressure distribution and
the droplet surface. These dynamics are mediated by the Young-Laplace boundary
between the droplet interior and ambient environment. Numerical simulations are
performed via global optimization against the rigorously defined interfacial
physics. The proposed pressure-interface feedback model is explicitly based on
the pressure distribution hypothesis. For low power acoustic excitation, the
simulations reveal a stable oscillatory feedback that induces capillary wave
formation. The simulation results are confirmed with direct observations of the
microscale droplet interface dynamics as provided by the high resolution
holographic measurements. The pressure-interface feedback model accurately
predicts the on-source vibration amplitude required to initiate capillary
waves, and interfacial oscillation amplitude and frequency. The radiation
pressure distribution is likewise confirmed with particle migration
observations. Viscous effects on wave attenuation are also studied by comparing
experimental and simulated results for a pure water droplet and 90% wt.- 10%

evolution with time of the vorticity field. For the non-rotating case, the
vortices evolve into thin filaments due to so-called forward/direct enstrophy

result of the inverse energy cascade. Rotation diminishes the forward cascade
of enstrophy (and hence the inverse cascade of energy) and tend to align the
vortical structures in the azimuthal/zonal direction. Our investigation reveals
that, for the initial vorticity field comprising of intermediate-wavenumber
spherical harmonics, the zonalization of the vortical structures is not
monotonic with ever decreasing Rossby numbers and the structures revert back to
a non-zonal state below a certain Rossby number. On the other hand, for the
initial vorticity field comprising of intermediate to large-wavenumber

also retains the new knowledge of the current gradient. We then present
Confidence Reservoir Sampling for maintaining a more informative memory buffer

consists of a self-supervised deep learning framework to label regions of
geological interest in seismic images. It projects the latent-space of an

learns to delineate regions of interest in the seismic images. To demonstrate
an application of both frameworks, a seismic volume was clustered into various
contiguous clusters, from which four clusters were selected based on distinct

from the selected clusters are used to train the encoder-decoder network. The
output of the encoder-decoder network is a probability map of the possibility

The structures are delineated using the probability map. The delineated images

In analogy to the Majorana zero mode (MZM) in topological superconductors, the

Remarkably, the non-Abelian geometric phase here originates from the

unique set of $r$ relays. However, few research efforts to consider $(H, r, u)$
multiaccess combination network problem where each $u$ users are connected to a
unique set of $r$ relays. A naive strategy to obtain a coded caching scheme for
$(H, r, u)$ multiaccess combination network is by $u$ times repeated
application of a coded caching scheme for a traditional $(H, r)$ combination
network. Obviously, the transmission load for each relay of this trivial scheme
is exactly $u$ times that of the original scheme, which implies that as the
number of users multiplies, the transmission load for each relay will also
multiply. Therefore, it is very meaningful to design a coded caching scheme for
$(H, r, u)$ multiaccess combination network with lower transmission load for
each relay. In this paper, by directly applying the well known coding method
(proposed by Zewail and Yener) for $(H, r)$ combination network, a coded
caching scheme (ZY scheme) for $(H, r, u)$ multiaccess combination network is
obtained. However, the subpacketization of this scheme has exponential order
with the number of users, which leads to a high implementation complexity. In
order to reduce the subpacketization, a direct construction of a coded caching
scheme for $(H, r, u)$ multiaccess combination network is proposed by means of
Combinational Design Theory, where the parameter $u$ must be a combinatorial
number. For arbitrary parameter $u$, a hybrid construction of a coded caching
scheme for $(H, r, u)$ multiaccess combination network is proposed based on our
direct construction. Theoretical and numerical analysis show that our last two
schemes have smaller transmission load for each relay compared with the trivial
scheme, and have much lower subpacketization compared with ZY scheme.

two-junction devices comprising high-quality III-V materials with band gaps
between 1.0 and 1.4 eV that are optimized for high emitter temperatures of
1900-2400{\deg}C. The cells exploit the concept of band-edge spectral filtering

reject unusable sub-bandgap radiation back to the emitter. A 1.4/1.2 eV device
reached a maximum efficiency of (41.1 +/- 1)% operating at a power density of
2.39 W/cm2 under an irradiance of 30.4 W/cm2 and emitter temperature of

potential to compete with turbine-based heat engines for large-scale power

surface-triangulated polyhedron, with spherical vertices whose positions are
determined by a shape-energy function with terms that constrain the particle
surface area, volume, and curvature, and prevent interparticle overlap. We show
that jammed packings of deformable particles without bending energy possess
low-frequency, quartic vibrational modes, whose number decreases with
increasing asphericity and matches the number of missing contacts relative to
the isostatic value. In contrast, jammed packings of deformable particles with
non-zero bending energy are isostatic in 3D, with no quartic modes. We find
that the contributions to the eigenmodes of the dynamical matrix from the shape
degrees of freedom are significant over the full range of frequency and shape
parameters for particles with zero bending energy. We further show that the
ensemble-averaged shear modulus $\langle G \rangle$ scales with pressure $P$ as
$\langle G \rangle \sim P^{\beta}$, with $\beta \approx 0.75$ for jammed
packings of deformable particles with zero bending energy. In contrast, $\beta
\approx 0.5$ for packings of deformable particles with non-zero bending energy,

homogeneous Caputo time fractional ordinary differential equations (F-ODEs) are
known to be completely determined by the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix.
Very different from the exponential decay of solutions to classical ODEs,
solutions of F-ODEs decay only polynomially, leading to the so-called
Mittag-Leffler stability, which was already extended to semi-linear F-ODEs with
small perturbations. This work is mainly devoted to the qualitative analysis of
the long-time behavior of numerical solutions. By applying the singularity
analysis of generating functions developed by Flajolet and Odlyzko (SIAM J.
Disc. Math. 3 (1990), 216-240), we are able to prove that both $\mathcal{L}$1
scheme and strong $A$-stable fractional linear multistep methods (F-LMMs) can
preserve the numerical Mittag-Leffler stability for linear homogeneous F-ODEs
exactly as in the continuous case. Through an improved estimate of the discrete
fractional resolvent operator, we show that strong $A$-stable F-LMMs are also
Mittag-Leffler stable for semi-linear F-ODEs under small perturbations. For the
numerical schemes based on $\alpha$-difference approximation to Caputo

the continuous fractional resolvent operator. Numerical experiments are
presented for several typical time fractional evolutional equations, including

found, which is essentially different from the classical tearing mode model. It
may provide a possible explanation for the finite mode penetration threshold at

drive a strong stabilizing effect on the neoclassical tearing mode.

semi-classical background field method we studied the rotation dependence of
the effective strong interaction coupling. Contrary to the magnetic field case
the rotation increases the effective coupling which leads to slowing down the
condensate melting procedure with temperature. This could be named as the
chiral vortical catalysis or inverse rotation suppression. Imposing such
dependence to the coupling in the NJL model, we numerically checked this
analysis qualitatively. The pseudo critical temperature is shown to rise with
the rotation and approach saturation eventually which may be induced by the

the magnetization by $180^\circ$ in ferromagnets, we propose an ASI
multiferroic system consisting of the peanut-shaped nanomagnets on
ferroelectric substrate with the angle between the easy axis and hard axis of
magnetization less than $90^\circ$. Here the piezoelectric strain-controlled
magnetization switching has been studied by applying the electric field pulse
at different angles with respect to the axes of the system. Remarkably,
magnetization switches by $180^\circ$ only if the external electric field pulse
is applied at some specific angles, close to the anisotropy axis of the system
( $\sim 30^\circ - 60^\circ$). Our detailed analysis of the demagnetization
energy variation reveals that the energy barrier becomes antisymmetric in such
cases, facilitating the complete magnetization reversal. Moreover, we have also
proposed a possible magnetization reversal mechanism with two sequential
electric field pulses of relatively smaller magnitude. We believe that the

Unfortunately, even experienced developers often fail to choose the right

the goal of reproducing predefined partitions in data. Such studies use
clusters of data that are often based on the context of the data as well as the
custom goal of the specific study. Depending on the data context, different
properties for distance distributions are judged to be relevant for appropriate
distance selection. However, if cluster analysis is based on the task of
finding similar partitions of data, then the intrapartition distances should be
smaller than the interpartition distances. By systematically investigating this
specification using distribution analysis through a mirrored-density plot, it
is shown that multimodal distance distributions are preferable in cluster
analysis. As a consequence, it is advantageous to model distance distributions
with Gaussian mixtures prior to the evaluation phase of unsupervised methods.
Experiments are performed on several artificial datasets and natural datasets
for the task of clustering.

underwater image enhancement. Most of them resort to training on synthetic data
and achieve outstanding performance. However, these methods ignore the
significant domain gap between the synthetic and real data (i.e., interdomain
gap), and thus the models trained on synthetic data often fail to generalize
well to real underwater scenarios. Furthermore, the complex and changeable
underwater environment also causes a great distribution gap among the real data
itself (i.e., intra-domain gap). However, almost no research focuses on this
problem and thus their techniques often produce visually unpleasing artifacts
and color distortions on various real images. Motivated by these observations,
we propose a novel Two-phase Underwater Domain Adaptation network (TUDA) to
simultaneously minimize the inter-domain and intra-domain gap. Concretely, a
new dual-alignment network is designed in the first phase, including a
translation part for enhancing realism of input images, followed by an
enhancement part. With performing image-level and feature-level adaptation in
two parts by jointly adversarial learning, the network can better build
invariance across domains and thus bridge the inter-domain gap. In the second
phase, we perform an easy-hard classification of real data according to the
assessed quality of enhanced images, where a rank-based underwater quality
assessment method is embedded. By leveraging implicit quality information
learned from rankings, this method can more accurately assess the perceptual
quality of enhanced images. Using pseudo labels from the easy part, an
easy-hard adaptation technique is then conducted to effectively decrease the
intra-domain gap between easy and hard samples.

electrodynamics. In addition to conceptual difficulties in its theoretical
formulation, the requirement of exceedingly large charge accelerations has thus
far prevented its unambiguous experimental identification. Here, we show how
measurable RR effects in a laser-electron interaction can be achieved through
the use of flying focus pulses (FFPs). By allowing the focus to
counterpropagate with respect to the pulse phase velocity, a FFP overcomes the
intrinsic limitation of a conventional laser Gaussian pulse (GP) that limits
its focus to a Rayleigh range. For an electron initially also
counterpropagating with respect to the pulse phase velocity, an extended
interaction length with the laser peak intensity is achieved in a FFP. As a
result, the same RR deceleration factors are obtained, but at FFP laser powers
orders of magnitude lower than for ultrashort GPs with the same energy. This
renders the proposed setup much more stable than those using GPs and allows for
more accurate \emph{in situ} diagnostics. Using the Landau-Lifshitz equation of
motion, we show numerically and analytically that the capability of emerging
laser systems to deliver focused FFPs will allow for a clear experimental
identification of RR.

clustering of particles, which is not compatible with physically-relevant

one hand, assuming such bounds, we construct correctors and prove
homogenization (using a variational formulation and $\Gamma$-convergence to
avoid delicate pressure issues). On the other hand, based on subcritical

particle distributions with nontrivial clustering. As a by-product of the

properties and therefore is not a local property of the considered domain
boundary. If the domains are nonlinear, but integrable - Toda lattice,
elastically colliding particles - the anomalies are similar to the case of the
linear chain, besides well-articulated thermal dependence of the resistance.
For the case of elastically colliding particles, this dependence follows a
simple scaling law - the resistance is proportional to the inverse square root
of the temperature. For Fermi-Pasta-Ulam domains, both the temperature drop and
the heat flux decrease with the chain length, but with different exponents, so
the resistance vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. For the domains comprised
of rotators, the thermal resistance exhibits the expected normal behavior.

of selecting a subset of channels among all available ones, extracting features
from the selected channels, and building a PM based on the extracted features,
where each component involves certain optimization tasks, i.e., selection of
channels, feature extraction (FE) methods, and PMs as well as configuration of
the selected FE method and PM. Accordingly, pursuing the best prediction
performance corresponds to optimizing the pipeline by solving all of its
involved optimization problems. This is a non-trivial task due to the vastness

at optimizing certain components of the pipeline, we propose a novel
evolutionary ensemble learning framework to optimize the entire pipeline in a
holistic manner. In this framework, a specific pipeline is encoded as a
candidate solution and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is applied
under different population sizes to produce multiple Pareto optimal sets
(POSs). Finally, selective ensemble learning is designed to choose the optimal
subset of solutions from the POSs and combine them to yield final prediction by
using greedy sequential selection and least square methods. We implement the
proposed framework and evaluate our implementation on two real-world
applications, i.e., electricity consumption prediction and air quality
prediction. The performance comparison with state-of-the-art techniques

improving its ability to cope with long-tailed distributions. To test this
hypothesis, we devise a new approach for training visual relationships models,
which is inspired by state-of-the-art long-tailed recognition literature. This
is based on an iterative decoupled training scheme, denoted Decoupled Training
for Devil in the Tails (DT2). DT2 employs a novel sampling approach,
Alternating Class-Balanced Sampling (ACBS), to capture the interplay between
the long-tailed entity and predicate distributions of visual relations. Results
show that, with an extremely simple architecture, DT2-ACBS significantly
outperforms much more complex state-of-the-art methods on scene graph
generation tasks. This suggests that the development of sophisticated models
must be considered in tandem with the long-tailed nature of the problem.

large self-supervised pre-trained models for both audio and text modality with
cross-modality attention for multimodal emotion recognition. We use Wav2Vec2.0
[1] as an audio encoder base for robust speech features extraction and the BERT
model [2] as a text encoder base for better contextual representation of text.
These high capacity models trained on large amounts of unlabeled data contain
rich feature representations and improve the downstream task's performance. We
use the cross-modal attention [3] mechanism to learn alignment between audio
and text representations from self-supervised models. Cross-modal attention
also helps in extracting interactive information between audio and text

features using statistics pooling for both audio and text modality and combine
them using the early fusion technique. Our experiments show that the proposed
approach obtains a 1.88% absolute improvement in accuracy compared to the
previous state-of-the-art method [3] on the IEMOCAP dataset [35]. We also
conduct unimodal experiments for both audio and text modalities and compare

number distribution in the Dianoga simulations of galaxy clusters performed
with the SPH code GADGET-3. The simulations include the effects of radiative
cooling, star formation, metal enrichment, supernova and active galactic nuclei
feedback. A grid-based shock-finding algorithm is applied in post-processing to
the outputs of the simulations. This procedure allows us to explore in detail
the distribution of shocked cells and their strengths as a function of cluster
mass, redshift and baryonic physics. We also pay special attention to the
connection between shock waves and the cool-core/non-cool core (CC/NCC) state
and the global dynamical status of the simulated clusters. In terms of general
shock statistics, we obtain a broad agreement with previous works, with weak
(low-Mach number) shocks filling most of the volume and processing most of the
total thermal energy flux. As a function of cluster mass, we find that massive
clusters seem more efficient in thermalising the IGM and tend to show larger
external accretion shocks than less massive systems. We do not find any
relevant difference between CC and NCC clusters. However, we find a mild
dependence of the radial distribution of the shock Mach number on the cluster
dynamical state, with disturbed systems showing stronger shocks than regular
ones throughout the cluster volume.

of architectures in a supernet and estimate their potential accuracy using the
network weights detached from the supernet. However, the ranking correlation
between the architectures' predicted accuracy and their actual capability is
incorrect, which causes the existing NAS methods' dilemma. We attribute this
ranking correlation problem to the supernet training consistency shift,
including feature shift and parameter shift. Feature shift is identified as
dynamic input distributions of a hidden layer due to random path sampling. The
input distribution dynamic affects the loss descent and finally affects
architecture ranking. Parameter shift is identified as contradictory parameter
updates for a shared layer lay in different paths in different training steps.
The rapidly-changing parameter could not preserve architecture ranking. We
address these two shifts simultaneously using a nontrivial supernet-Pi model,
called Pi-NAS. Specifically, we employ a supernet-Pi model that contains
cross-path learning to reduce the feature consistency shift between different
paths. Meanwhile, we adopt a novel nontrivial mean teacher containing negative
samples to overcome parameter shift and model collision. Furthermore, our
Pi-NAS runs in an unsupervised manner, which can search for more transferable
architectures. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and a wide range of downstream
tasks (e.g., COCO 2017, ADE20K, and Cityscapes) demonstrate the effectiveness

become a popular approach in topology optimization. In some design settings,
however, the iterative optimization process converges only slowly, or not at
all even after several hundreds or thousands of iterations. This leads to
regions in which a distinct binary design is difficult to achieve. Interpreting
intermediate density values by applying a threshold results in large solid or
void regions, leading to sub-optimal structures. We find that this convergence
issue relates to the topology of the stress tensor field that is simulated when
applying the same external forces on the solid design domain. In particular,
low convergence is observed in regions around so-called trisector degenerate
points. Based on this observation, we propose an automatic initialization
process that prescribes the topological skeleton of the stress field into the
material field as solid simulation elements. These elements guide the material
deposition around the degenerate points, but can also be remodelled or removed
during the optimization. We demonstrate significantly improved convergence
rates in a number of use cases with complex stress topologies. The improved
convergence is demonstrated for infill optimization under homogeneous as well

$N$-soliton solutions for the NLS equation by using the $\bar{\partial}$
generalization of the Deift-Zhou nonlinear steepest descent method. Their

a vector field whose curl remains zero or grows in proportion to specified
source terms. Such PDEs are referred to as curl-free or curl-preserving
respectively. In this paper we catalogue a class of DG-like schemes for such
PDEs. To retain the globally curl-free or curl-preserving constraints, the
components of the vector field, as well as their higher moments, have to be
collocated at the edges of the mesh. They are updated by using potentials that
are collocated at the vertices of the mesh. The resulting schemes : 1) do not
blow up even after very long integration times, 2) do not need any special
cleaning treatment, 3) can operate with large explicit timesteps, 4) do not
require the solution of an elliptic system and 5) can be extended to higher
orders using DG-like methods. The methods rely on a special curl-preserving
reconstruction and they also rely on multidimensional upwinding. The Galerkin
projection, so crucial to the design of a DG method, is now carried out in the
edges of the mesh and yields a weak form update that uses potentials that are
obtained at the vertices of the mesh with the help of a multidimensional
Riemann solver. A von Neumann stability analysis of the curl-preserving methods
is carried out and the limiting CFL numbers of this entire family of methods is
catalogued in this work. The stability analysis confirms that with increasing
order of accuracy, our novel curl-free methods have superlative phase accuracy
while substantially reducing dissipation. We also show that PNPM-like methods
retain much of the excellent wave propagation characteristics of the DG-like
methods while offering a much larger CFL number and lower computational

medium called Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) in relativistic heavy-ion collisions,
and a long-range correlation among produced particles has been considered as a
strong evidence of strongly interacting QGP. Strikingly, clear long-range
correlations have been also observed in small collision systems like $pp$ and
$p$+$A$ at a wide range of collision energies. A model introducing a repulsive
force between flux tubes called string shoving can qualitatively describe the
long-range near-side correlations in high multiplicity $pp$ collisions. This
model implemented in the PYTHIA Monte Carlo event generator allows us to
perform detailed study. In this work, a full data analysis to calculate
associated yields and flow coefficients is performed with PYTHIA events, and
the results are compared with experimental results. We find that the string
shoving model overestimates long-range near-side correlations particularly in
low multiplicity events. We also introduce a method to subtract such
overestimated correlations in low multiplicity to have a more relevant
comparison with the data.

and onward HIV transmission within the camps. In this commentary, we discuss
the context and the changing dynamics of HIV/AIDS during COVID-19 among the
Rohingya refugee community in Bangladesh. What we currently observe is the
worst crisis in the Rohingya refugee camps thus far. Firstly, because of being
displaced, Rohingya refugees have increased vulnerability to HIV, as well as to
STIs and other poor health outcomes. Secondly, for the same reason, they have
inadequate access to HIV testing treatment and care. Not only because of their
refugee status but also because of the poor capacity of the host country to
provide services. Thirdly, a host of complex economic, socio-cultural and
behavioural factors exacerbate their dire situation with access to HIV testing,
treatment and care. And finally, the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has
changed priorities in all societies, including the refugee camps. In the
context of the unfolding COVID-19 crisis, more emphasis is placed on COVID-19
rather than other health issues, which exacerbates the dire situation with HIV
detection, management, and prevention among Rohingya refugees. Despite the
common crisis experienced by most countries around the world, the international
community has an obligation to work together to improve the life, livelihood,

object queries' position information. Thus model needs extra learning to figure
out the newest regions that query position should express and need more
attention. To fix this issue, we propose the Guided Query Position (GQPos)

position iteratively.
  Another problem of such transformer-based detection heads is the high
complexity to perform attention on multi-scale feature maps, which hinders them
from improving detection performance at all scales. Therefore we propose a
novel fusion scheme named Similar Attention (SiA): besides the feature maps is
fused, SiA also fuse the attention weights maps to accelerate the learning of
high-resolution attention weight map by well-learned low-resolution attention

striking relevance in practical applications. Despite the fact that the
behaviour of colloids in the bulk is key to identify the main elements
affecting their equilibrium and dynamics, it is only by studying their response
under confinement that one can ponder the use of colloids in formulation
technology. In particular, confining fluids of anisotropic particles in
nanopores provides the opportunity to control their phase behaviour and
stabilise a spectrum of morphologies that cannot form in the bulk. By properly
selecting pore geometry, particle architecture and system packing, it is
possible to tune thermodynamic, structural and dynamical properties for ad hoc
applications. In the present contribution, we report Grand Canonical and
Dynamic Monte Carlo simulations of suspensions of colloidal cubes and cuboids
constrained into cylindrical nanopores of different size. We first study their
phase behaviour, calculate the chemical potential vs density equation of state
and characterise the effect of the pore walls on particle anchoring and
layering. In particular, at large enough concentrations, we observe the
formation of concentric nematic-like coronas of oblate or prolate particles
surrounding an isotropic core, whose features resemble those typically detected
in the bulk. We then analyse the main characteristics of their dynamics and
discover that these are dramatically determined by the ability of particles to
diffuse in the longitudinal and radial direction of the nanopore.

paradigm which compares the two nodes' ultra-wideband (UWB) channels to other
nodes, called observers. The main idea is that the dissimilarity between the
channel impulse responses (CIRs) increases with $d$ and allows for an estimate
$\hat{d}$. Our approach relies on extracting common multipath components (MPCs)
from the CIRs. This is realistic in indoor or urban scenarios and if $d$ is
considerably smaller than the observer distances. We present distance
estimators which utilize the rich location information contained in MPC delay
differences. Likewise, we present estimators for the relative position vector
which process both MPC delays and MPC directions. We do so for various
important cases: with and without time synchronization, delay measurement
errors, and knowledge of the MPC association between the CIRs. The estimators
exhibit great technological advantages: they do not require line-of-sight
conditions, observer location knowledge, or environment knowledge. We study the
estimation accuracy with a numerical evaluation based on random sampling and,
additionally, with an experimental evaluation based on measurements in an
indoor environment. The proposal shows the potential for great accuracy in

result that most of these dwarf S0 galaxies are classified as fast rotators.
The ratio of average atomic gas mass to stellar mass (~ 47%) is much greater
than that of molecular gas mass to stellar mass (~ 1%). In addition, the
gas-phase metallicities in the star-forming regions are lower than that of the
non-star-forming regions. These results indicate that the extended star
formation may originate from the combination of abundant atomic hydrogen, long
dynamic time scale and low-density environment.

electron positron collider (CEPC) must be smaller than 10$\mathrm{MeV}$ to make
sure the accurate measurement of the mass of the Higgs boson. In order to
simplify the energy measurement system, a new method is proposed by fitting the
Compton edge of the energy distribution of the gamma ray from a
microwave-electron Compton scattering. With our method, the uncertainty of the
energy measurement is 6$\mathrm{MeV}$ for the electron energy of
$120\mathrm{GeV}$ in the Higgs mode. In this system, the energy resolution of
the gamma detection needs to reach $10^{-4}$. Therefore, only the high-purity
germanium (HPGe) detector can meet the critical requirement. In a head-on
collision mode, the initial photons should be microwave photons with the
wavelength of 3.04 centimeters. A cylindrical resonant cavity with selected
${TM_{010}}$ mode is used to transmit microwaves. After the microwave-electron
Compton backscattering, the scattered photons and the synchrotron-radiation
background transmit a shielding structure and then are detected by a HPGe
detector at the end of the beam line of the synchrotron-radiation applications.
The hole radius in the side wall of the cavity is about $1.5\mathrm{mm}$ to
allow the electron beam passing through. The results of the computer simulation
technology (CST) software shows that the influence of the hole radius on the
cavity field is negligible. The change of the resonance frequency can be easily
corrected by fine-tuning the cavity size.

obligatory for deep learning-based systems. Adversarial training with
first-order attacks has been one of the most effective defenses against
adversarial perturbations to this day. The majority of the adversarial training
approaches focus on iteratively perturbing each pixel with the gradient of the
loss function with respect to the input image. However, the adversarial
training with gradient-based attacks lacks diversity and does not generalize
well to natural images and various attacks. This study presents a robust
training algorithm where the adversarial perturbations are automatically
synthesized from a random vector using a generator network. The classifier is
trained with cross-entropy loss regularized with the optimal transport distance
between the representations of the natural and synthesized adversarial samples.
Unlike prevailing generative defenses, the proposed one-step attack generation
framework synthesizes diverse perturbations without utilizing gradient of the
classifier's loss. Experimental results show that the proposed approach attains
comparable robustness with various gradient-based and generative robust
training techniques on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN datasets. In addition,
compared to the baselines, the proposed robust training framework generalizes
well to the natural samples. Code and trained models will be made publicly

emission lines can be well explained by different physical conditions to two
central BLRs in a central BBH system in SDSS J1547. Furthermore, the long-term
light curve from CSS can be well described by a sinusoidal function with a
periodicity about 2159days, providing further evidence to support the expected
central BBH system in SDSS J1547. Therefore, it is interesting to treat
different line profiles of broad Balmer emission lines as intrinsic indicators

system, which is contradictory. This led to IT professionals having more
privilege and authority over end-users. This dichotomous relation is a
derivative of the organizational structure. The notion of portraying IT
professionals in charge and having more authority over end-users is an avenue
for conflict. The paper concludes that a HIS organizational structure where
decision-making is centralized is a ground for conflict and a major roadblock
of building local capacity and providing infrastructural support at the
peripheral.

  Positioning","39 pages, 15 figures",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled positioning that uses UAVs as aerial
anchor nodes is a promising solution for providing positioning services in
harsh environments. In previous research, the state sensing and control of UAVs
were either ignored or simply set to be performed continuously, resulting in
system instability or waste of wireless resources. Therefore, in this article,
we propose a quality-of-service (QoS)-oriented UAV-enabled positioning system
based on the concept of sensing-communication-control (SCC) co-design. We first
establish the mathematical models of UAV state sensing and control. Then, the
influence of sensing scheduling and transmission failure on UAV stability, as
well as the performance of positioning services in the presence of UAV control
error, are analyzed. Based on these models and analysis results, we further
study the problem of minimizing the amount of data transmitted by optimizing
the sensing scheduling and blocklength allocation under the condition of
satisfying each user's demand. Finally, an efficient scheme is developed to
solve this mixed-integer nonlinear problem. Numerical results show that the
proposed system could work efficiently and meet users' requirements. In
addition, compared with two benchmark schemes, our scheme reduces the failure
rate or resource consumption of positioning services by more than 76.2% or
82.7%.

wireless channel remains constant within the channel coherence time but can
change rapidly across blocks. The goal is to design a link rate selection
strategy that can identify the best transmission rate quickly and adaptively in
quasi-static channels. This problem can be cast into the stochastic bandit
framework, and the unawareness of time-stamps where channel changes
necessitates running change-point detection simultaneously with stochastic
bandit algorithms to improve adaptivity. We present a joint channel
change-point detection and link rate selection algorithm based on Thompson
Sampling (CD-TS) and show it can achieve a sublinear regret with respect to the
number of time steps $T$ when the channel coherence time is larger than a
threshold. We then improve the CD-TS algorithm by considering the fact that
higher transmission rate has higher packet-loss probability. Finally, we
validate the performance of the proposed algorithms through numerical
simulations.

based on biometric identification has been found to magnify exclusions, imply
informational asymmetries, and reproduce policy structures that negatively
affect recipients. In this paper, we use a data justice lens to study Rythu
Bharosa, a social welfare scheme targeting farmers in the Andhra Pradesh state
of India. While coverage of the scheme in terms of number of recipients is
reportedly high, our fieldwork revealed three forms of data justice to be
monitored for intended recipients. A first form is design-related, as
mismatches of recipients with their registered biometric credentials and bank
account details are associated to denial of subsidies. A second form is
informational, as users who do not receive subsidies are often not informed of
the reason why it is so, or of the grievance redressal processes available to
them. To these dimensions our data add a structural one, centred on the
conditionality of subsidy to approval by landowners, which forces tenant
farmers to request a type of landowner consent that reproduces existing
patterns of class and caste subordination. Identifying such data justice
issues, the paper adds to problematisations of digital social welfare systems,
contributing a structural dimension to studies of data justice in digital

Human factors in the education system, such as teacher training for the usage
of ICTs, digital literacy of students and parents, and already existing
vulnerabilities in the education system pose challenges to crisis management in
the education sector. Other socio-political factors such as attitudes towards
girls' education, level of corruption, institutional capacity, and

after heart dis-eases constitutes one of the major challenges of modern
medicine. Ayurveda, the traditional Indian medicinal systemenrooted in the
Vedic literature and considered as a schema for the holistic management of
health, characterizes various neurological diseases disorders (NDDs) and
prescribes several herbs, formulations, and bio-cleansing regimes for their
care and cure. In this work, we examined neuro-phytoregulatory potential of
34,472 phytochemicals among 3,038 herbs (including their varieties) mentioned
in Ayurveda using network pharmacology approach and found that 45% of these
Ayurvedic phytochemicals (APCs) have regulatory associations with 1,643
approved protein targets. Metabolite interconversion enzymes and protein
modifying enzymes were found to be the major target classes of APCs against
NDDs. The study further suggests that the actions of Ayurvedic herbs in
managing NDDs were majorly via regulating signalling processes, like, G-protein
signaling, acetylcholine signaling, chemokine signaling pathway and GnRH
signaling. A high confidence network specific to 219 pharmaceutically relevant
neuro-phytoregulators (NPRs) from 1,197 Ayurvedic herbs against 102 approved
protein-targets involved in NDDs was developed and analyzed for gaining
mechanistic insights. The key protein targets of NPRs to elicit their
neuro-regulatory effect were highlighted as CYP and TRPA, while estradiol and
melatonin were identified as the NPRs with high multi-targeting ability. 32
herbs enriched in NPRs were identified that include some of the well-known
Ayurvedic neurological recommendations, like, Papaver somniferum, Glycyrrhiza
glabra, Citrus aurantium, Cannabis sativa etc. Herbs enriched in NPRs may be
used as a chemical source library for drug-discovery against NDDs from systems

imbalanced (statistical heterogeneity) and distribution shifted training data
of FL is distributed in the federated network, which will increase the
divergences between the local models and the global model, further degrading
performance. In this paper, we propose a flexible clustered federated learning
(CFL) framework named FlexCFL, in which we 1) group the training of clients
based on the similarities between the clients' optimization directions for
lower training divergence; 2) implement an efficient newcomer device cold start

clients to meet the challenge of client-level data distribution shift. FlexCFL
can achieve improvements by dividing joint optimization into groups of
sub-optimization and can strike a balance between accuracy and communication
efficiency in the distribution shift environment. The convergence and
complexity are analyzed to demonstrate the efficiency of FlexCFL. We also
evaluate FlexCFL on several open datasets and made comparisons with related CFL
frameworks. The results show that FlexCFL can significantly improve absolute

achieve this goal, we construct a set of features that encapsulate relevant

subsequently leveraged first to generate a leader-lagger network that
quantifies how markets impact one another, and then to train linear models
capable of explaining between 10% and 37% of total variation in $500$ms future
returns (depending on which market is the prediction target). The results are
then compared with those of various PnL calculations that take trading
realities, such as transaction costs, into account. The PnL calculations are
based on natural $\textit{taker}$ strategies (meaning they employ market
orders) that we associate to each model. Our findings emphasize the role of a
market's fee regime in determining its propensity to being a leader or a
lagger, as well as the profitability of our taker strategy. Taking our analysis
further, we also derive a natural $\textit{maker}$ strategy (i.e., one that
uses only passive limit orders), which, due to the difficulties associated with
backtesting maker strategies, we test in a real-world live trading experiment,
in which we turned over 1.5 million USD in notional volume. Lending additional

divides system implementation into so-called program organization units (POUs)
as the smallest software unit and is comprised of multiple textual and
graphical programming languages that can be arbitrarily nested. A common
practice during the development of such systems is reusing implementation
artifacts by copying, pasting, and then modifying code. This approach is
referred to as code cloning. It is used on a fine-granular level where a POU is
cloned within a system variant. It is also applied on the coarse-granular
system level, where the entire system is cloned and adapted to create a system
variant, for example for another customer. This ad hoc practice for the
development of variants is commonly referred to as clone-and-own. It allows the
fast development of variants to meet varying customer requirements or altered
regulatory guidelines. However, clone-and-own is a non-sustainable approach and
does not scale with an increasing number of variants. It has a detrimental
effect on the overall quality of a software system, such as the propagation of
bugs to other variants, which harms maintenance. In order to support the
effective development and maintenance of such systems, a detailed code clone
analysis is required. On the one hand, an analysis of code clones within a
variant (i.e., clone detection in the classical sense) supports experts in
refactoring respective code into library components. On the other hand, an
analysis of commonalities and differences between cloned variants (i.e.,
variability analysis) supports the maintenance and further reuse and
facilitates the migration of variants into a software product line (SPL).

universities suffer from cyber-attacks and the losses that result from them
keeps increasing. Our observation, however, indicates that most Nigerian
universities run their cyber security without using scientifically derived
frameworks that spell out how to manage threats and breaches that emanate from

aid their teaching. LMSs helped primary schools build resilience to cope with
unexpected events. An opportunity rose to study the affordances and constraints
faced when using a LMS for remote teaching, specifically for primary school
learners ('Gen Z') - a largely ignored area of research. Through a case study
of 6 schools, this research describes the affordances and constraints of the
LMS supported teaching system in use in primary schools. Affordances related to
schools, learners and teachers while constraints were classified from a
financial, technological, school, learner and teacher perspective. Noteworthy
affordances included using LMSs as notice boards and satisfying parents, the
key stakeholders. In terms of constraints, the digital divide was a recurring
theme while device and data costs were consistently a limitation. There were
many cases of schools not realizing the full potential of LMS usage. This
research should be useful for primary schools wanting to use a LMS for their
teaching.

in tuning the process and observation noises for a discrete-time linear Kalman
filter. Conventional approaches to tuning (e.g. using normalized estimation
error squared and covariance minimization) compute empirical measures of filter
performance and the parameter are selected manually or selected using some kind
of optimization algorithm to maximize these measures of performance. However,
there are two challenges with this approach. First, in theory, many of these
measures do not guarantee a unique solution due to observability issues.
Second, in practice, empirically computed statistical quantities can be very
noisy due to a finite number of samples. We propose a method to overcome these
limitations. Our method has two main parts to it. The first is to ensure that
the tuning problem has a single unique solution. We achieve this by
simultaneously tuning the filter over multiple different prediction intervals.
Although this yields a unique solution, practical issues (such as sampling
noise) mean that it cannot be directly applied. Therefore, we use Bayesian
Optimization. This technique handles noisy data and the local minima that it
introduces.

outstanding performance, most studies have been verified in the setting where
the train and test data are drawn from the same domain. The domain mismatch

for Conformer-based encoder networks, which can exploit local and generalized
global information by pruning most of the in-domain fitted global connections.
Also, we propose a state reset method for the generalization of the prediction

Our best model, a MobileNet-V2 network pre-trained on ImageNet, achieved 65.11%

inference latency on a Motorola Moto G6 phone. This balanced accuracy is only
1.79% less than the current state of the art for CAFE, which used a model that
contains 26.62x more parameters and was unable to run on the Moto G6, even when

meaningfully one has to employ regularization methods. Traditionally, popular
regularization methods have been the penalized Variational approaches. In
recent years, the classical regularized-reconstruction approaches have been
outclassed by the (deep-learning-based) learned reconstruction algorithms.
However, unlike the traditional regularization methods, the theoretical
underpinnings, such as stability and regularization, have been insufficient for
such learned reconstruction algorithms. Hence, the results obtained from such
algorithms, though empirically outstanding, can't always be completely trusted,
as they may contain certain instabilities or (hallucinated) features arising
from the learned process. In fact, it has been shown that such learning
algorithms are very susceptible to small (adversarial) noises in the data and
can lead to severe instabilities in the recovered solution, which can be quite
different than the inherent instabilities of the ill-posed (inverse) problem.
Whereas, the classical regularization methods can handle such (adversarial)
noises very well and can produce stable recovery. Here, we try to present
certain regularization methods to stabilize such (unstable) learned
reconstruction methods and recover a regularized solution, even in the presence
of adversarial noises. For this, we need to extend the classical notion of
regularization and incorporate it in the learned reconstruction algorithms. We
also present some regularization techniques to regularize two of the most
popular learning reconstruction algorithms, the Learned Post-Processing
Reconstruction and the Learned Unrolling Reconstruction.
