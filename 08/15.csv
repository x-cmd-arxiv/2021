  Bounded Controls and Directed Graphs",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper explores distributed Nash equilibrium seeking problems for games
in which the players have limited knowledge on other players' actions. In
particular, the involved players are considered to be high-order integrators
with their control inputs constrained within a pre-specified region. A linear
transformation for the players' dynamics is firstly utilized to facilitate the
design of bounded control inputs incorporating multiple saturation functions.
By introducing consensus protocols with adaptive and time-varying gains, the
unknown actions for players are distributively estimated. Then, a fully
distributed Nash equilibrium seeking strategy is exploited, showcasing its
remarkable properties: i) ensuring the boundedness of control inputs; ii)
avoiding any global information/parameters; and iii) allowing the graph to be
directed. Based on Lyapunov stability analysis, it is theoretically proved that
the proposed distributed control strategy can lead all the players' actions to
the Nash equilibrium. Finally, an illustrative example is given to validate
effectiveness of the proposed method.

from the water. Spherical glass, a dome port, is well suited for high water
pressures at great depth, allows for a large field of view, and avoids
refraction if a pinhole camera is positioned exactly at the sphere's center.
Adjusting a real lens perfectly to the dome center is a challenging task, both
in terms of how to actually guide the centering process (e.g. visual servoing)
and how to measure the alignment quality, but also, how to mechanically perform
the alignment. Consequently, such systems are prone to being decentered by some
offset, leading to challenging refraction patterns at the sphere that
invalidate the pinhole camera model. We show that the overall camera system
becomes an axial camera, even for thick domes as used for deep sea exploration
and provide a non-iterative way to compute the center of refraction without
requiring knowledge of exact air, glass or water properties. We also analyze
the refractive geometry at the sphere, looking at effects such as forward- vs.
backward decentering, iso-refraction curves and obtain a 6th-degree polynomial
equation for forward projection of 3D points in thin domes. We then propose a
pure underwater calibration procedure to estimate the decentering from multiple

mechanical position of the lens, or can be considered in photogrammetric
underwater applications.

where each individual node of the robot is capable of measuring the lengths of

computing and executing its own control actions with its connected edges.
Through an iterative distributed optimization, the individual members utilize
local information to converge on a global estimate of the robot's state, and
then coordinate their planned motion to achieve desired global behavior. This
distributed optimization is based on a consensus alternating direction method
of multipliers framework. This distributed algorithm is then adapted to control
an isoperimetric truss robot, and the distributed algorithm is used in an
experimental demonstration. The demonstration allows a user to broadcast
commands to a single node of the robot, which then ensures the coordinated
motion of all other nodes to achieve the desired global motion.

Lorentz-invariant linear theory of a two-index symmetric tensor field, which
constitutes a generalization of the Fierz-Pauli theory describing linearized
gravity. Finally we discuss two results, the well-known Weinberg-Witten theorem
and a more recent theorem by Marolf, that are often invoked as no-go theorems
for emergent gravity. Our analysis illustrates that, although these results
pinpoint some of the particularities of gravity with respect to other gauge
theories, they do not constitute an impediment for the emergent gravity program

this paper.

  Enhancement for Adversarial Domain Adaptation","10 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Adversarial domain adaptation has made impressive advances in transferring
knowledge from the source domain to the target domain by aligning feature
distributions of both domains. These methods focus on minimizing domain
divergence and regard the adaptability, which is measured as the expected error
of the ideal joint hypothesis on these two domains, as a small constant.
However, these approaches still face two issues: (1) Adversarial domain
alignment distorts the original feature distributions, deteriorating the
adaptability; (2) Transforming feature representations to be domain-invariant
needs to sacrifice domain-specific variations, resulting in weaker
discriminability. In order to alleviate these issues, we propose
category-invariant feature enhancement (CIFE), a general mechanism that
enhances the adversarial domain adaptation through optimizing the adaptability.
Specifically, the CIFE approach introduces category-invariant features to boost
the discriminability of domain-invariant features with preserving the
transferability. Experiments show that the CIFE could improve upon
representative adversarial domain adaptation methods to yield state-of-the-art
results on five benchmarks.

unstructured texts, automatic information extraction (IE) can help scale up the
processing by converting the unstructured reports to structured forms, e.g.,
software names and versions and vulnerability types. Existing works on
automated IE for security vulnerability reports often rely on a large number of
labeled training samples. However, creating massive labeled training set is
both expensive and time consuming. In this work, for the first time, we propose
to investigate this problem where only a small number of labeled training
samples are available. In particular, we investigate the performance of
fine-tuning several state-of-the-art pre-trained language models on our small
training dataset. The results show that with pre-trained language models and
carefully tuned hyperparameters, we have reached or slightly outperformed the
state-of-the-art system on this task. Consistent with previous two-step process
of first fine-tuning on main category and then transfer learning to others as
in [7], if otherwise following our proposed approach, the number of required
labeled samples substantially decrease in both stages: 90% reduction in
fine-tuning from 5758 to 576,and 88.8% reduction in transfer learning with 64
labeled samples per category. Our experiments thus demonstrate the
effectiveness of few-sample learning on NER for security vulnerability report.

program implementation costs. We present two approaches to doing so:
pretraining our model to warm start the experiment with simulated tasks, and
using a planning model trained to simulate the real world's rewards to the
agent. We present results that demonstrate the utility of offline reinforcement
learning to efficient price-setting in the energy demand response problem.

dichalcogenides (TMDs) when the materials are combined in so-called van der

(SPPPs). The extend to which these modes are coupled depends on the TMD
composition and structure, but also on the plasmons' properties. By performing
realistic simulations that account for the contribution of each layer of the
vdWh separately, we calculate how the strength of plasmon-phonon coupling

are likely to generate strong excess emission in the mid-infrared (MIR) that is
associated with the waste heat they generate. For those civilisations that
capture starlight via Dyson sphere like constructions, the Optical to MIR flux
ratio of the host galaxies is also expected to be unusually low. Since a wide
range of galaxy types adhere to the infrared-radio correlation (IRC), galaxies
hosting Type III civilisations should also strongly deviate from this relation.
Radio data can therefore play a crucial role in breaking the degeneracy between
the effects of dust obscuration in a galaxy and the signature of an
energy-intensive civilisation. We have used the newly released LoTSS-DR1
value-added catalogue to create a sample of 16,367 $z < 0.2$ sources with radio
and MIR flux densities, optical photometry and (photometric) redshifts. We
calculated the IRC parameter $q^{{\rm22~\mu m}}_{{\rm 150~MHz}}$ =
log($S_{150~{\rm MHz}}$/$S_{22~{\rm \mu m}}$) and identified 21 sources with
exceptionally high values of $q^{{\rm22~\mu m}}_{{\rm 150~MHz}}$, an indication
of MIR emission enhanced by a factor of $\sim$ 10. Out of the 21 high $q$-value
sources, 4 sources have very red MIR colors, and appear to have relatively low
optical/MIR ratios. Two of the 4 sources are not well known in the literature,
they are considered as potential hosts of Type III civilisations. These sources
deserve further study and investigation. Finally, we note that extending our
analysis to the full LoTSS survey area can place very strong constraints on the
incidence of Type III civilisations in the universe.

attention map to provide sufficient object information. Extensive experiments
prove that our model significantly improves the performance compared to
existing methods. Comprehensive ablation experiments and visualization studies
also show the significant effect of our method on few-shot segmentation task.

permeability are central in constraining both storage efficiency and sealing
properties of CO$_2$ storage systems. Constitutive functions for porous systems
are in part determined by wettability, which is a pore-scale phenomenon that
influences macroscale displacement. While wettability of saline aquifers and
caprocks are assumed to remain water-wet when CO$_2$ is injected, there is
recent evidence of contact angle change due to long-term CO$_2$ exposure.
Weakening of capillary forces alters the saturation functions dynamically over
time. Recently, new dynamic models were developed for saturation functions that
capture the impact of wettability alteration (WA) due to long-term CO$_2$
exposure. In this paper, these functions are implemented into a two-phase
two-component simulator to study long-term WA dynamics for field-scale CO$_2$
storage. We simulate WA effects on horizontal migration patterns under
injection and buoyancy-driven migration in the caprock. We characterize the
behavior of each scenario for different flow regimes. Our results show the
impact on storage efficiency can be described by the capillary number, while
vertical leakage can be scaled by caprock sealing parameters. Scaling models
for CO$_2$ migration into the caprock show that long-term WA poses little risk
to CO$_2$ containment over relevant timescales.

electrocardiographic imaging and to find methods reducing line-of-block (LoB)
artifacts, while preserving real LoBs. Methods: Body surface potentials were
computed for 137 simulated ventricular excitations. Subsequently, the inverse
problem was solved to obtain extracellular potentials (EP) and transmembrane
voltages (TMV). From these, activation times (AT) were estimated using four
methods and compared to the ground truth. This process was evaluated with two
cardiac mesh resolutions. Factors contributing to LoB artifacts were identified
by analyzing the impact of spatial and temporal smoothing on the morphology of
source signals. Results: AT estimation using a spatiotemporal derivative
performed better than using a temporal derivative. Compared to deflection-based
AT estimation, correlation-based methods were less prone to LoB artifacts but
performed worse in identifying real LoBs. Temporal smoothing could eliminate
artifacts for TMVs but not for EPs, which could be linked to their temporal
morphology. TMVs led to more accurate ATs on the septum than EPs. Mesh
resolution had a negligible effect on inverse reconstructions, but small
distances were important for cross-correlation-based estimation of AT delays.
Conclusion: LoB artifacts are mainly caused by the inherent spatial smoothing
effect of the inverse reconstruction. Among the configurations evaluated, only
deflection-based AT estimation in combination with TMVs and strong temporal
smoothing can prevent LoB artifacts, while preserving real LoBs. Significance:
Regions of slow conduction are of considerable clinical interest and LoB
artifacts observed in non-invasive ATs can lead to misinterpretations. We
addressed this problem by identifying factors causing such artifacts and
methods to reduce them.

evolution of standard Big Bang cosmology. Due to the lack of direct

additional constraints on inflationary models is prevalent in the literature.
In this work, we develop a formalism to analyze the reheating constraints for
the general case of single field canonical slow-roll inflation without dealing
with a specific inflationary model. We find that using the lower bound on
reheating temperature and the upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio: one
can constrain the inflationary energy scale and the duration of the reheating

the reheating phase with an effective equation of state parameter~($w_{\rm

information of the reheating phase even when the reheating equation of state
behaves as radiation $w_{\rm re} = 1/3$. For the canonical reheating phase
described by $w_{\rm re}<1/3$, we find that the inflationary efolding number
must be bounded from above, i.e., $N_k\leq56.09$. Consequently, if inflationary
efolds satisfy this upper bound---i.e., $N_k=56.09$---a finite period of
reheating is only possible for exotic reheating phases described by $w_{\rm
re}>1/3$. We also find that as we lower the value of $N_k$, the corresponding
energy scale of inflation also decreases. Consequently, it will be more and
more difficult to detect the corresponding inflationary gravitational wave
signals with the Gravitational Waves mission. Finally, we show how an extended
period of canonical reheating can improve the situation in those cases.

ReLU. Here, we derive these solutions via sparse coding with orthogonal-assumed
basis functions, then we derive the convolutional neural network forward
transformation from a modified non-negative orthogonal sparse coding model with
an exponential prior parameter for each sparse coding coefficient. Next, we
derive a complete convolutional neural network without normalization and

Finally we motivate potentially more robust forward transformations by
maintaining sparse priors in convolutional neural networks as well performing a

building additional machine learning and Deep Learning models which predict the
optimal dropout rate given some hidden units in each dense layer. Linear
regression and polynomial logistic regression require the use of arbitrary

well-written sources. However, in intelligent voice assistants, where NER is an
important component, input to NER may be noisy because of user or speech
recognition error. In applications, entity labels may change frequently, and
non-textual properties like topicality or popularity may be needed to choose
among alternatives.
  We describe a NER system intended to address these problems. We test and
train this system on a proprietary user-derived dataset. We compare with a
baseline text-only NER system; the baseline enhanced with external gazetteers;
and the baseline enhanced with the search and indirect labelling techniques we
describe below. The final configuration gives around 6% reduction in NER error
rate. We also show that this technique improves related tasks, such as semantic
parsing, with an improvement of up to 5% in error rate.

Green-Lazarsfeld index, which measures the ""linearity"" of the minimal free
resolution of the ideal of $X$. In all previously known cases this bound was
tight. We provide the first class of examples where the bound is not tight; in
fact the difference between Hankel index and Green-Lazarsfeld index can be
arbitrarily large. Our examples are outer projections of rational normal
curves, where we identify the center of projection with a binary form $F$. The
Green-Lazarsfeld index of the projected curve is given by the complex Waring
border rank of $F$ [15]. We show that the Hankel index is given by the ""almost

accompanied by physical models that distinguish between different current flow
and light emission mechanisms for different applied voltages and temperature
ranges. Three exponential regimes in the I - V characteristics were identified
for low bias levels where no optical radiation takes place. At the lowest bias
levels, the diffusion-recombination mechanism based on the classical
Shockley-Reid-Hall theory dominates. This is followed, at low and near room
temperature, by a combination of weak tunneling and generation-recombination,
respectively. In the third exponential region, for all temperatures carrier
transport is dictated by strong tunneling, which is characterized by a
temperature-independent slope of the I - V curves and a variable ideality
factor. The I - V results were compared to a conventional QD laser in which the
current flow mechanisms of the first and third types are absent, which clearly
demonstrates the key role played by the TI layer.
  In the post-exponential voltage range, when the diodes are in the high
injection regime, the characteristics of the two types of diodes are identical.
The typical behavior at the threshold current, where the output power increases
fast has a clear signature in the I - V characteristics. Finally, an analytical
quantitative relationship is established between the light output power and the

always be at the top of the list. While NMT based code editing systems generate
a broad spectrum of plausible patches, the correct one depends on the
developers' requirement and often on the context where the patch is applied.
Thus, if developers provide some hints, using natural language, or providing
patch context, NMT models can benefit from them. As a proof of concept, in this
research, we leverage three modalities of information: edit location, edit code
context, commit messages (as a proxy of developers' hint in natural language)
to automatically generate edits with NMT models. To that end, we build MODIT, a
multi-modal NMT based code editing engine. With in-depth investigation and

emerging demand of specific action understanding in real-world applications,
whereas the data of rare fine-grained categories is very limited. Therefore, we
propose the few-shot fine-grained action recognition problem, aiming to
recognize novel fine-grained actions with only few samples given for each
class. Although progress has been made in coarse-grained actions, existing
few-shot recognition methods encounter two issues handling fine-grained
actions: the inability to capture subtle action details and the inadequacy in
learning from data with low inter-class variance. To tackle the first issue, a
human vision inspired bidirectional attention module (BAM) is proposed.
Combining top-down task-driven signals with bottom-up salient stimuli, BAM
captures subtle action details by accurately highlighting informative
spatio-temporal regions. To address the second issue, we introduce contrastive
meta-learning (CML). Compared with the widely adopted ProtoNet-based method,
CML generates more discriminative video representations for low inter-class
variance data, since it makes full use of potential contrastive pairs in each
training episode. Furthermore, to fairly compare different models, we establish
specific benchmark protocols on two large-scale fine-grained action recognition
datasets. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across evaluated tasks.

Within this framework, we provides a reasonable description of the $D$ meson
suppression and flow coefficients in Pb-Pb collisions, as well as predictions
for both $D$ and $B$ meson observables in other collision systems yet to be

coefficient relies on both the system size and the geometric anisotropy of the
QGP. Sizable suppression and flow are predicted for both $D$ and $B$ mesons in
O-O collisions, which serve as a crucial bridge of jet quenching between large

source-destination pairs from the CAIDA Telescope data has been analyzed with
GraphBLAS hierarchical hypersparse matrices. These analyses provide unique
insight on this unsolicited Internet darkspace traffic with the discovery of
many previously unseen scaling relations. The data show a significant sustained

C16/C17 campaigns of the Kepler/K2 mission. Here we present the Kepler/K2 and
ground based observations of SN 2017jgh, which captured the shock cooling of
the progenitor shock breakout with an unprecedented cadence. This event
presents a unique opportunity to investigate the progenitors of stripped
envelope supernovae. By fitting analytical models to the SN 2017jgh lightcurve,
we find that the progenitor of SN 2017jgh was likely a yellow supergiant with
an envelope radius of $\sim50-290~R_{\odot}$, and an envelope mass of
$\sim0-1.7~M_{\odot}$. SN 2017jgh likely had a shock velocity of
$\sim7500-10300$ km s$^{-1}$. Additionally, we use the lightcurve of SN 2017jgh
to investigate how early observations of the rise contribute to constraints on
progenitor models. Fitting just the ground based observations, we find an
envelope radius of $\sim50-330~R_{\odot}$, an envelope mass of
$\sim0.3-1.7~M_{\odot}$ and a shock velocity of $\sim9,000-15,000$ km s$^{-1}$.
Without the rise, the explosion time can not be well constrained which leads to
a systematic offset in the velocity parameter and larger uncertainties in the
mass and radius. Therefore, it is likely that progenitor property estimates
through these models may have larger systematic uncertainties than previously
calculated.

martingale characterization for designing PE algorithms. The first one
minimizes a ""martingale loss function"", whose solution is proved to be the best
approximation of the true value function in the mean--square sense. This method
interprets the classical gradient Monte-Carlo algorithm. The second method is
based on a system of equations called the ""martingale orthogonality conditions""
with test functions. Solving these equations in different ways recovers various
classical TD algorithms, such as TD($\lambda$), LSTD, and GTD. Different
choices of test functions determine in what sense the resulting solutions
approximate the true value function. Moreover, we prove that any convergent
time-discretized algorithm converges to its continuous-time counterpart as the

theoretical results and corresponding algorithms with numerical experiments and

images from single RGB images captured by commercial cameras, \textbf{without}
using paired HS and RGB images during training. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a new lightweight and end-to-end learning-based framework.
Specifically, on the basis of the intrinsic imaging degradation model of RGB
images from HS images, we progressively spread the differences between input
RGB images and re-projected RGB images from recovered HS images via effective
unsupervised camera spectral response function estimation. To enable the
learning without paired ground-truth HS images as supervision, we adopt the
adversarial learning manner and boost it with a simple yet effective
$\mathcal{L}_1$ gradient clipping scheme. Besides, we embed the semantic
information of input RGB images to locally regularize the unsupervised
learning, which is expected to promote pixels with identical semantics to have
consistent spectral signatures. In addition to conducting quantitative
experiments over two widely-used datasets for HS image reconstruction from
synthetic RGB images, we also evaluate our method by applying recovered HS

(HAP) broadcasts energy signals to multiple devices for their energy harvesting
in the downlink (DL) and meanwhile receives information signals in the uplink

beamforming configurations to strike a balance between the system performance
and signaling overhead as well as implementation complexity. We first propose
the fully dynamic IRS beamforming, where the IRS phase-shift vectors vary with
each time slot for both DL wireless energy transfer (WET) and UL wireless
information transmission (WIT). To further reduce signaling overhead and
implementation complexity, we then study two special cases, namely, partially
dynamic IRS beamforming and static IRS beamforming. For the former case, two
different phase-shift vectors can be exploited for the DL WET and the UL WIT,
respectively, whereas for the latter case, the same phase-shift vector needs to
be applied for both DL and UL transmissions. We aim to maximize the system
throughput by jointly optimizing the time allocation, HAP transmit power, and
IRS phase shifts for the above three cases. Two efficient algorithms based on
alternating optimization and penalty-based algorithms are respectively proposed
for both perfect self-interference cancellation (SIC) case and imperfect SIC
case by applying successive convex approximation and difference-of-convex
optimization techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the benefits of IRS for
enhancing the performance of FD-WPCN, and also show that the IRS-aided FD-WPCN
is able to achieve significantly performance gain compared to its counterpart
with half-duplex when the self-interference (SI) is properly suppressed.

This is mainly because of similarity in structure of characters, different
handwriting styles, noisy datasets, diversity of scripts, focus of the
conventional research on handcrafted feature extraction techniques, and
unavailability of public datasets and code-repositories to reproduce the
results. On the other hand, deep learning has witnessed huge success in
different areas of pattern recognition, including HCR, and provides an
end-to-end learning. However, deep learning techniques are computationally
expensive, need large amount of data for training and have been developed for
specific scripts only. To address the above limitations, we have proposed a
novel generic deep learning architecture for script independent handwritten

learning approach for HCR, which partly utilizes feature extraction layers of a
pre-trained network. Due to transfer learning and image-augmentation, HCR-Net
provides faster and computationally efficient training, better performance and
better generalizations, and can work with small datasets. HCR-Net is
extensively evaluated on 40 publicly available datasets of Bangla, Punjabi,
Hindi, English, Swedish, Urdu, Farsi, Tibetan, Kannada, Malayalam, Telugu,
Marathi, Nepali and Arabic languages, and established 26 new benchmark results

investigated the photo/magnetic field reshaped CDW melting phenomenon of quasi

magnitude of hysteretic resistance variation is achieved due to CDW melting,

of both electronic and structural phase transition. Surprisingly, the phase
transition could be driven by applying a minimum voltage interval of 10 {\mu}V

sharpness of the transition is manifested by single point current jumping
(SPCJ). Photodetectors based on this transition has much superior performance

spherical Couette flow (SCF), with an emphasis on the competition among
polygonal coherence with different wave numbers observed over transitional
Reynolds numbers. Focusing on a representative case, the half-radius ratio, we
confirm that the axisymmetric state becomes unstable over the first
transitional Reynolds number at which the 4-fold spiral state bifurcates, using
the continuation method based on the Newton-Raphson algorithm. The
Galerkin-spectral method was employed to numerically solve the governing
equations. It is found that the 3-fold spiral state bifurcates from the
axisymmetric state at a slightly higher Reynolds number than the first
transitional Reynolds number. The attraction of the 3-fold spiral state expands
rapidly with an increase in the Reynolds number, which is determined by
verifying the distance of the unstable periodic-like state to both spiral
states in the state space. This aspect of the state space explains the
experimentally bistable realization of different equilibrium states over the
first transitional Reynolds number. This study also found that the
periodic-like state is composed of the 3- and 4-fold spiral states, similar to
a beat with two different frequencies.

Stokes' theorem is that this surface must be orientable. Many students wonder
what happens to the flux through a surface when this is not orientable, as it
happens with a M\""obius strip. On an orientable surface one can compute the
flux of a solenoidal field using Stokes' theorem in terms of the circulation of
the vector potential of the field along the oriented boundary of the surface.
But this cannot be done if the surface is not orientable, though in principle
this quantity could be measured on a laboratory. For instance, checking the

Then, the detector is progressively improved through alternating between

hybrid quality-aware triplet memory to improve the quality and stability of
generated pseudo labels. Meanwhile, in the model training stage, we propose a

policy to effectively rectify noisy gradient directions and avoid model
over-fitting to noisy pseudo labeled data. These specific designs enable the
detector to be trained on meticulously refined pseudo labeled target data with
denoised training signals, and thus effectively facilitate adapting an object
detector to a target domain without requiring annotations. Finally, our method
is assessed on four 3D benchmark datasets (i.e., Waymo, KITTI, Lyft, and

detection (DAOD), recent advances mainly explore aligning feature-level

Towards DAOD, it is important to extract domain-invariant object
representations. To this end, in this paper, we try to disentangle
domain-invariant representations from domain-specific representations. And we
propose a novel disentangled method based on vector decomposition. Firstly, an
extractor is devised to separate domain-invariant representations from the
input, which are used for extracting object proposals. Secondly,
domain-specific representations are introduced as the differences between the
input and domain-invariant representations. Through the difference operation,
the gap between the domain-specific and domain-invariant representations is
enlarged, which promotes domain-invariant representations to contain more
domain-irrelevant information. In the experiment, we separately evaluate our
method on the single- and compound-target case. For the single-target case,
experimental results of four domain-shift scenes show our method obtains a
significant performance gain over baseline methods. Moreover, for the
compound-target case (i.e., the target is a compound of two different domains
without domain labels), our method outperforms baseline methods by around 4%,

in contrast, are scale-free cascades of neural activity, often considered as
evidence of brain tuning to criticality. While models have been developed to
account for oscillations or avalanches separately, they typically do not
explain both phenomena, are too complex to analyze analytically, or intractable
to infer from data rigorously. Here we propose a non-equilibrium
feedback-driven Ising like class of neural networks that simultaneously and
quantitatively captures scale-free avalanches and scale-specific oscillations.
In the most simple yet fully microscopic model version we can analytically
compute the phase diagram and make direct contact with human brain
resting-state activity recordings via tractable inference of the model's two
essential parameters. The inferred model quantitatively captures the dynamics
over a broad range of scales, from single sensor oscillations and collective
behaviors of nearly-synchronous extreme events on multiple sensors, to neuronal
avalanches unfolding over multiple sensors across multiple time bins.
Importantly, the inferred parameters correlate with model-independent
signatures of ""closeness to criticality"", indicating that the coexistence of
scale-specific (neural oscillations) and scale-free (neuronal avalanches)
dynamics in brain activity occurs close to a non-equilibrium critical point at
the onset of self-sustained oscillations.

transfer on the nanoscale due to its importance in multiple technologies such
as thermal control and sensing applications. Heat conduction through the
nanoconfined gas medium differs from macroscopic predictions due to several
reasons. The continuum assumption is broken down; the surface forces which
extend deeper through the gas medium become prominent due to the large
surface-to-volume ratio, and, finally, the gas molecules are accumulated
nonuniformly on the solid surfaces. In this work, to better understand the
combination of these phenomena on the heat conduction through the nanoconfined
gas medium, we present a series of molecular dynamics simulations of argon gas
confined between either metals or silicon walls. The gas density is set so that
gas experiences a wide range of Knudsen numbers from continuum to the free
molecular regime. It is observed that the intrinsic characteristics of the
solid determine the gas density distribution near the walls and consequently in
the bulk region, and these distributions control the heat conduction through
the gas medium. While the nanochannel walls have their most significant impact
on the density and temperature distributions of the rarefied gas, the pressure
and the heat flux across the gas domain converge toward a plateau as the gas
becomes denser. We propose new analytical formulas for calculating the gas
pressure, induced heat flux, and effective thermal conductivity through the
strongly nanoconfined gas, which incorporates the wall force field impacts on
the gas transport characteristics for the Knudsen number in the range of 0.05

is challenging because the analog precoder and combiner are required to be

representative plate as a plate whose stress-strain state in some parts is
similar to the stress-strain state in the original plate. In addition, every

the temporal convolution kernel size unchanged. We surprisingly find this

  Our first major contribution is an intrinsic convolutional mesh U-net

Soft-correspondence is formulated as coordinates in a newly-constructed

efficient optimization, both for network training and for the next step of the

maximally leverage domain-specific prior knowledge.
  The pairing of a mesh-convolutional network with generative model fitting
enables us to predict correspondence for real human surface scans including
occlusions, partialities, and varying genus (e.g. from self-contact). We

have shortcomings. Solutions implemented in the memory controller (MC) incur
increasingly higher costs due to their conservative design for the worst case
in terms of the number of DRAM banks and RH threshold to support. Meanwhile,
DRAM-side implementation either has a limited time margin for RH-protection
measures or requires extensive modifications to the standard DRAM interface.
Recently, a new command for RH-protection has been introduced in the
DDR5/LPDDR5 standards, referred to as refresh management (RFM). RFM enables the
separation of the tasks for RHprotection to both MC and DRAM by having the

promising, no existing study presents and analyzes RFM-based solutions for

SPG, we experiment with two representative detectors, PointPillars and PV-RCNN.
On the UDA task, SPG significantly improves both detectors across all object
categories of interest and at all difficulty levels. SPG can also benefit
object detection in the original domain. On the Waymo Open Dataset and KITTI,
SPG improves 3D detection results of these two methods across all categories.
Combined with PV-RCNN, SPG achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection results on

HiTab, a free and open dataset to study question answering (QA) and natural
language generation (NLG) over hierarchical tables. HiTab is a cross-domain
dataset constructed from a wealth of statistical reports (analyses) and

revised from original, meaningful, and diverse descriptive sentences authored
by analysts and professions of reports. (3) to reveal complex numerical
reasoning in statistical analyses, we provide fine-grained annotations of
entity and quantity alignment. HiTab provides 10,686 QA pairs and descriptive
sentences with well-annotated quantity and entity alignment on 3,597 tables
with broad coverage of table hierarchies and numerical reasoning types.
  Targeting hierarchical structure, we devise a novel hierarchy-aware logical
form for symbolic reasoning over tables, which shows high effectiveness.
Targeting complex numerical reasoning, we propose partially supervised training

largely reduce spurious predictions in the QA task. In the NLG task, we find
that entity and quantity alignment also helps NLG models to generate better
results in a conditional generation setting. Experiment results of

is represented by cellular-connected UAVs, where traditional terrestrial users
coexist with flying UAVs acting as additional aerial users, which access the
5G/B5G cellular network infrastructure from the sky. In this scenario, we study
the challenging application in which an UAV acting as aerial user (AU) and a
static (i.e., fixed) terrestrial user (TU) are paired to simultaneously
transmit their uplink signals to a ground base station (BS) in the same
time-frequency resource blocks. In such a case, due to the highly dynamic
nature of the UAV, the signal transmitted by the AU experiences both time
dispersion due to multipath propagation effects and frequency dispersion caused
by Doppler shifts. On the other hand, for a static ground network, frequency
dispersion of the signal transmitted by TU is negligible and only multipath
effects have to be taken into account. To decode the superposed signals at the
BS by using finite-length data record, we propose a novel sky-ground (SG)
nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) receiving structure that additionally
exploits the different circularity/noncircularity and almost-cyclostationarity
properties of the AU and TU by means of improved channel estimation and
time-varying successive interference cancellation. Numerical results
demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed SG uplink NOMA reception scheme in

rate analysis of the fixed-point iteration of the GAN operator. The proposed
generalized averaged nonexpansiveness is weaker than the averaged
nonexpansiveness while stronger than nonexpansiveness. We show that the
fixed-point iteration of a GAN operator with a positive exponent converges to
its fixed-point and estimate the local convergence rate (the convergence rate
in terms of the distance between consecutive iterates) according to the range
of the exponent. We prove that the fixed-point iteration of a GAN operator with
a positive exponent strictly smaller than 1 can achieve an exponential global
convergence rate (the convergence rate in terms of the distance between an
iterate and the solution). Furthermore, we establish the global convergence
rate of the fixed-point iteration of a GAN operator, depending on both the
exponent of generalized averaged nonexpansiveness and the exponent of the
H$\ddot{\text{o}}$lder regularity, if the GAN operator is also
H$\ddot{\text{o}}$lder regular. We then apply the established theory to three

of MoS_2 have the best coefficient of extinction and SPR in the biological

gold-silver alloy alone cannot function within the range of biological windows,
MoS_2 was used, which increased the extinction efficiency at higher

distribution within the tumor tissue reached its maximum value at the center of

the inherent one-to-many mapping between audio and body motions. Conventional
CNNs/RNNs assume one-to-one mapping, and thus tend to predict the average of
all possible target motions, resulting in plain/boring motions during
inference. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a novel conditional
variational autoencoder (VAE) that explicitly models one-to-many
audio-to-motion mapping by splitting the cross-modal latent code into shared
code and motion-specific code. The shared code mainly models the strong
correlation between audio and motion (such as the synchronized audio and motion
beats), while the motion-specific code captures diverse motion information
independent of the audio. However, splitting the latent code into two parts
poses training difficulties for the VAE model. A mapping network facilitating
random sampling along with other techniques including relaxed motion loss,
bicycle constraint, and diversity loss are designed to better train the VAE.
Experiments on both 3D and 2D motion datasets verify that our method generates
more realistic and diverse motions than state-of-the-art methods,
quantitatively and qualitatively. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can
be readily used to generate motion sequences with user-specified motion clips

make predictions on data whose distribution changes gradually along time,
leading to a drift between the train and test distributions. Such models are
often re-trained on new data periodically, and they hence need to generalize to
data not too far into the future. In this context, there is much prior work on
enhancing temporal generalization, e.g. continuous transportation of past data,
kernel smoothed time-sensitive parameters and more recently, adversarial
learning of time-invariant features. However, these methods share several
limitations, e.g, poor scalability, training instability, and dependence on
unlabeled data from the future. Responding to the above limitations, we propose
a simple method that starts with a model with time-sensitive parameters but
regularizes its temporal complexity using a Gradient Interpolation (GI) loss.
GI allows the decision boundary to change along time and can still prevent
overfitting to the limited training time snapshots by allowing task-specific
control over changes along time. We compare our method to existing baselines on
multiple real-world datasets, which show that GI outperforms more complicated
generative and adversarial approaches on the one hand, and simpler gradient
regularization methods on the other.

problem when the training classes and test classes are disjoint. Achieving this
usually needs experts to externalize their domain knowledge by manually
specifying a class-attribute matrix to define which classes have which
attributes. Designing a suitable class-attribute matrix is the key to the
subsequent procedure, but this design process is tedious and trial-and-error
with no guidance. This paper proposes a visual explainable active learning
approach with its design and implementation called semantic navigator to solve
the above problems. This approach promotes human-AI teaming with four actions
(ask, explain, recommend, respond) in each interaction loop. The machine asks
contrastive questions to guide humans in the thinking process of attributes. A
novel visualization called semantic map explains the current status of the
machine. Therefore analysts can better understand why the machine misclassifies
objects. Moreover, the machine recommends the labels of classes for each
attribute to ease the labeling burden. Finally, humans can steer the model by
modifying the labels interactively, and the machine adjusts its
recommendations. The visual explainable active learning approach improves
humans' efficiency of building zero-shot classification models interactively,
compared with the method without guidance. We justify our results with user
studies using the standard benchmarks for zero-shot classification.

Home batteries hold the promise of enabling efficient and user-oblivious
substation constraints management. Centralized control of home batteries would
achieve optimal efficiency. However, it is hardly acceptable by users, since
service providers (e.g., utilities or aggregators) would directly control
batteries at user premises. Unfortunately, devising efficient hierarchical

  We present a novel two-layer control strategy for home batteries that avoids
direct control of home devices by the service provider and at the same time
yields near-optimal substation constraints management efficiency. Our
simulation results on field data from 62 households in Denmark show that the
substation constraints management efficiency achieved with our approach is at

universe, the appearance of atoms and that of large-scale structures,
altogether omitting any reference to the living world. Yet, like the physical
world, the living world occupies space, is composed of baryonic matter, and is
submitted to the four fundamental forces. To bridge this break in continuity, a
study relying solely on the laws of physics was conducted to seek a pattern
that would unite both worlds. Here we show evidence of a common pattern that is
based on a gravitating organization. Seven criteria were worked out to define a
gravitating concept that applies to any attractive force. A scan through the
second version of the Integrative levels classification system revealed that
the following six types of objects satisfy the criteria: atoms, eukaryotic
cells, vertebrates, nation-states, planetary systems, and galaxies. A
comparative diameter study was carried out on objects confined to the Solar
System in the Milky Way. The trendline linking the average diameters follows an
exponential function f(x)=0.2527x10^6.23x, with a coefficient of determination
of 0.9904. The objects assemble into a superstructure spanning 32 orders of
magnitude, systematically skipping 6.23 orders of magnitude at each level. The
unity of structure revealed in this study suggests that both worlds result from
a common underlying organizing process. Furthermore, the gradual and
uninterrupted sequence leading to complex structures supports the idea that the
gravitating organization offers a favorable pathway to complexity. The
framework presented in this study may help address complex phenomena such as
emergence and agency, broaden the scope of the theory of evolution and fuel the
debate on the definition of life itself. Ultimately, it may contribute to a
more complete understanding of the universe.

alternative CNN backbone appended with two parallel subtasks: (1) predicting
per-instance category via transformer and (2) dynamically generating
segmentation mask with the multi-level upsampling module. SOTR can effectively
extract lower-level feature representations and capture long-range context
dependencies by Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and twin transformer,
respectively. Meanwhile, compared with the original transformer, the proposed
twin transformer is time- and resource-efficient since only a row and a column
attention are involved to encode pixels. Moreover, SOTR is easy to be
incorporated with various CNN backbones and transformer model variants to make
considerable improvements for the segmentation accuracy and training
convergence. Extensive experiments show that our SOTR performs well on the MS

proposals have become popular recently due to the growing interest in object
detection. The common paradigm is to learn object proposals from data labeled
with a set of object regions and their corresponding categories. However, this
approach often struggles with novel objects in the open world that are absent
in the training set. In this paper, we identify that the problem is that the
binary classifiers in existing proposal methods tend to overfit to the training
categories. Therefore, we propose a classification-free Object Localization
Network (OLN) which estimates the objectness of each region purely by how well
the location and shape of a region overlap with any ground-truth object (e.g.,
centerness and IoU). This simple strategy learns generalizable objectness and
outperforms existing proposals on cross-category generalization on COCO, as

rounded results for all inputs. In contrast, CR-LIBM and RLIBM provide
correctly rounded implementations for a specific FP representation with one
rounding mode. Using such libraries for a representation with a new rounding
mode or with different precision will result in wrong results due to double
rounding. This paper proposes a novel method to generate a single polynomial
approximation that produces correctly rounded results for all inputs for
multiple rounding modes and multiple precision configurations. To generate a
correctly rounded library for $n$-bits, our key idea is to generate such a
polynomial approximation for a representation with $n+2$-bits using the
\emph{round-to-odd} mode. We prove that the resulting polynomial approximation
will produce correctly rounded results for all five rounding modes in the
standard and for multiple representations with $k$-bits such that $|E| +1 < k
\leq n$, where $|E|$ is the number of exponent bits in the representation.
Building on our prior work in the RLIBM project, we also approximate the
correctly rounded result when we generate the library with $n+2$-bits using the
round-to-odd mode. We also generate polynomial approximations by structuring it
as a linear programming problem but propose enhancements to polynomial
generation to handle the round-to-odd mode. Our prototype is the first 32-bit
float library that produces correctly rounded results with all rounding modes
in the IEEE standard for all inputs with a single polynomial approximation. It
also produces correctly rounded results for any FP configuration ranging from
10-bits to 32-bits while also being faster than mainstream libraries.

the energy level statistics. We identify the critical point associated with
this transition using the maximum variance of the block entanglement over the

Zipper 2 (Trp-zip2) peptide solvated in water. We use an embedded-fragment
approach to reduce the statistical errors (fluctuation and systematic bias),
where the entire peptide is the main fragment and the remaining 425 water
molecules are grouped into small fragments. We analyze the magnitude of the
statistical errors in the forces and find that the systematic bias is of the
order of $0.065\,eV/\r{A}$ ($\sim1.2\times10^{-3}E_{h}/a_{0}$) when 120
stochastic orbitals are used, independently of systems size. This magnitude of
bias is sufficiently small to ensure that the bond lengths estimated by
stochastic DFT (within a Langevin molecular dynamics simulation) will deviate
by less than 1% from those predicted by a deterministic calculation.

attention in recent years because of their critical role in mitigating traffic
congestion and understanding travel behaviours. However, previous studies
usually only consider temporal dependence but ignore the spatial correlations
among parking lots for parking prediction. This is mainly due to the lack of
direct physical connections or observable interactions between them. Thus, how
to quantify the spatial correlation remains a significant challenge. To bridge
the gap, in this study, we propose a spatial-aware parking prediction
framework, which includes two steps, i.e. spatial connection graph construction
and spatio-temporal forecasting. A case study in Ningbo, China is conducted
using parking data of over one million records before and during COVID-19. The
results show that the approach is superior on parking occupancy forecasting
than baseline methods, especially for the cases with high temporal irregularity
such as during COVID-19. Our work has revealed the impact of the pandemic on
parking behaviour and also accentuated the importance of modelling spatial
dependence in parking behaviour forecasting, which can benefit future studies
on epidemiology and human travel behaviours.

applications including image, speech, text, and data analysis. Use of ML to
understand underlying patterns in gene mutations (genomics) has far-reaching
results, not only in overcoming diagnostic pitfalls, but also in designing
treatments for life-threatening diseases like cancer. Success and
sustainability of ML algorithms depends on the quality and diversity of data
collected and used for training. Under-representation of groups (ethnic groups,
gender groups, etc.) in such a dataset can lead to inaccurate predictions for
certain groups, which can further exacerbate systemic discrimination issues.
  In this work, we propose TRAPDOOR, a methodology for identification of biased
datasets by repurposing a technique that has been mostly proposed for nefarious
purposes: Neural network backdoors. We consider a typical collaborative
learning setting of the genomics supply chain, where data may come from
hospitals, collaborative projects, or research institutes to a central cloud
without awareness of bias against a sensitive group. In this context, we
develop a methodology to leak potential bias information of the collective data
without hampering the genuine performance using ML backdooring catered for
genomic applications. Using a real-world cancer dataset, we analyze the dataset
with the bias that already existed towards white individuals and also
introduced biases in datasets artificially, and our experimental result show
that TRAPDOOR can detect the presence of dataset bias with 100% accuracy, and
furthermore can also extract the extent of bias by recovering the percentage

methods for pattern recognition. It is shown that for pattern recognition
applications such indexing methods replace with inverse patterns the fully
inverted files, which are typically employed in search engines. Not only such
inversion provide automatic feature extraction, which is a distinguishing mark
of deep learning, but, unlike deep learning, pattern inversion supports almost
instantaneous learning, which is a consequence of absence of coefficients. The

demonstrate a view-angle independent recognition of three-dimensional objects,
such as cars, against arbitrary background, prediction of remaining useful life

this paper, inspired by piece-wise linear interpretability of DNNs, we propose
a novel Active Learning with DivErse iNterpretations (ALDEN) approach. With
local interpretations in DNNs, ALDEN identifies linearly separable regions of
samples. Then, it selects samples according to their diversity of local
interpretations and queries their labels. To tackle the text classification
problem, we choose the word with the most diverse interpretations to represent
the whole sentence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ALDEN consistently
outperforms several state-of-the-art deep active learning methods.

equation (D-VIE) for modeling high-contrast conductive dielectric objects in a
broad frequency range. This new formulation is particularly suitable for
modeling biological tissues at low frequencies, as it is required by brain
epileptogenic area imaging, but also at higher ones, as it is required by
several applications including, but not limited to, transcranial magnetic and
deep brain stimulation (TMS and DBS, respectively). When modeling inhomogeneous
objects with high complex permittivities at low frequencies, the traditional
D-VIE is ill-conditioned and suffers from numerical instabilities that result
in slower convergence and in less accurate solutions. In this work we address
these shortcomings by leveraging a new set of volume quasi-Helmholtz
projectors. Their scaling by the material permittivity matrix allows for the
re-balancing of the equation when applied to inhomogeneous scatterers and
thereby makes the proposed method accurate and stable even for high complex
permittivity objects until arbitrarily low frequencies. Numerical results,
canonical and realistic, corroborate the theory and confirm the stability and
the accuracy of this new method both in the quasi-static regime and at higher
frequencies.

presented here. Modeling efforts have focused on describing those
physiologically realistic mechanisms which govern the regulation of membrane
permeability in nerve. The motivation behind identifying such mechanisms lies
in understanding the morphology of neural activity on a meaningful and
analytically tractable level. The suggested merit of integrating control theory
into the analysis lies in providing how a membrane effectively adapts to
changes in permeability and through what governing mechanisms. The value in
producing such an understanding lies in mirroring biological reality in a more
formal manner than could be achieved solely through experimental means. A
bang-bang control policy describing the permeability correction mechanisms is
developed using Liapunov's Stability Criteria. Both changes in membrane
potential and kinetic rates are required to implement the policy. The policy
describes the inherent mechanisms of the membrane which act to drive its
permeability from unstable firing to the resting potential state. It is shown
that these permeability changes in state are governed by a switching function
that depends on the membrane potential and a dominant controlling parameter.
The control policy is discussed in the context of solutions of the
Hodgkin-Huxley Equations of Ionic Hypothesis.
