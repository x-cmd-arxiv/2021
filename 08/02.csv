has become an invaluable tool in the design process. Webots, a state-of-the-art
robotics simulator, is often the software of choice for robotics research. Even
so, Webots simulations are often run on personal and lab computers. For
projects that would benefit from an aggregated output dataset from thousands of
simulation runs, there is no standard recourse; this project sets out to
mitigate this by developing a formalized parallel pipeline for running
sequences of Webots simulations on powerful HPC resources. Such a pipeline
would allow researchers to generate massive datasets from their simulations,
opening the door for potential machine learning applications and decision tool
development. We have developed a pipeline capable of running Webots simulations
both headlessly and in GUI-enabled mode over an SSH X11 server, with simulation
execution occurring remotely on HPC compute nodes. Additionally, simulations
can be run in sequence, with a batch job being distributed across an arbitrary
number of computing nodes and each node having multiple instances running in
parallel. The implemented distribution and parallelization are extremely
effective, with a 100\% simulation completion rate after 12 hours of runs.
Overall, this pipeline is very capable and can be used to extend existing
projects or serve as a platform for new robotics simulation endeavors.

this issue, we investigate the possibility of performing randomized smoothing

Another important aspect is that we use orthogonal modules, whose Lipschitz

estimated in the latent space back to the input space, providing valid
certifiable regions for the test samples in the input space. Experiments on
CIFAR10 and ImageNet show that our method achieves competitive certified

box from a linear model that is corrupted with a noise vector following the
Gaussian distribution. One of the commonly used detectors is the maximum
likelihood detector, which is obtained by solving a box-constrained integer
least squares problem, that is NP-hard. Two other popular detectors are the
box-constrained rounding and Babai detectors due to their high efficiency of
implementation. In this paper, we first present formulas for the success
probabilities (the probabilities of correct detection) of these three detectors
for two different situations: the integer parameter vector is deterministic and
is uniformly distributed over the constraint box. Then, we give two simple
examples to respectively show that the success probability of the
box-constrained rounding detector can be larger than that of the
box-constrained Babai detector and the latter can be larger than the success
probability of the maximum likelihood detector when the parameter vector is
deterministic, and prove that the success probability of the box-constrained
rounding detector is always not larger than that of the box-constrained Babai
detector when the parameter vector is uniformly distributed over the constraint
box. Some relations between the results for the box constrained and ordinary
cases are presented, and two bounds on the success probability of the maximum
likelihood detector, which can easily be computed, are developed. Finally,
simulation results are provided to illustrate our main theoretical findings.

infrastructure is vital to mitigate losses due to seismic events. A promising
approach for seismic isolation systems is metamaterials-based wave barriers.
Metamaterials -- engineered composites -- manipulate the propagation and
attenuation of seismic waves. Borrowing ideas from phononic and sonic crystals,
the central goal of a metamaterials-based wave barrier is to create band gaps
that cover the frequencies of seismic waves. The two quantities of interest
(QoIs) that characterize band-gaps are the first-frequency cutoff and the
band-gap's width. Researchers often use analytical (band-gap analysis),
experimental (shake table tests), and statistical (global variance) approaches
to tailor the QoIs. However, these approaches are expensive and
compute-intensive. So, a pressing need exists for alternative easy-to-use
methods to quantify the correlation between input (design) parameters and QoIs.
To quantify such a correlation, in this paper, we will use Shapley values, a
technique from the cooperative game theory. In addition, we will develop
machine learning models that can predict the QoIs for a given set of input
(material and geometrical) parameters.

a minimal model dependence based on an interpolation of short- and

weakly-coupled pNRQCD and the long-distance one is computed using an effective
string theory. The effective string theory coincides with the one for pure
gluodynamics with the addition of a fermion field constrained to move on the
string. We compute the hyperfine contributions to the doubly heavy baryon
spectrum. The unknown parameters are obtained from heavy quark-diquark symmetry
or fitted to the available lattice QCD determinations of the hyperfine
splittings. Using these parameters we compute the double charm and bottom
baryon spectrum including the hyperfine contributions. We compare our results
with those of other approaches and find that our results are closer to lattice
QCD determinations, in particular for the excited states. Furthermore, we
compute the vacuum energy in the effective string theory and show that the

pollution in low- and middle-income countries' urban areas. Given the adverse
impacts of air pollution, many responses have been taken, including migration
to another city. The current study explores the psychological process and
demographic predictors of migration intention among urban people in Hanoi,
Vietnam - one of the most polluted capital cities in the world. The Bayesian
Mindsponge Framework (BMF) was used to construct the model and perform Bayesian
analysis on a stratified random sampling dataset of 475 urban people. We found
that the migration intention was negatively associated with the individual's
satisfaction with air quality. The association was moderated by the perceived
availability of a better alternative (or nearby city with better air quality).
However, the high migration cost due to geographical distance made the
moderation effect of the perceived availability of a better alternative
negligible. Moreover, it was also found that male and young people were more
likely to migrate, but the brain drain hypothesis was not validated. The
results hint that without air pollution mitigation measures, the dislocation of
economic forces might occur and hinder sustainable urban development.
Therefore, collaborative actions among levels of government, with the
semi-conducting principle at heart, are recommended to reduce air pollution.

intelligent transportation systems (ITS) applications used in management and
operations. While there have been some promising advances in the field, there
is a need for modern deep learning algorithms that allow real-time trajectory
prediction on embedded IoT devices. This article presents DeepTrack, a novel
deep learning algorithm customized for real-time vehicle trajectory prediction
and monitoring applications in arterial management, freeway management, traffic
incident management, and work zone management for high-speed incoming traffic.
In contrast to previous methods, the vehicle dynamics are encoded using
Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) to provide more robust time prediction
with less computation. DeepTrack also uses depthwise convolution, which reduces
the complexity of models compared to existing approaches in terms of model size
and operations. Overall, our experimental results demonstrate that DeepTrack
achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art trajectory prediction models
but with smaller model sizes and lower computational complexity, making it more
suitable for real-world deployment.

intelligent algorithms in large-scale networks. Reinforcement learning (RL) is
known as model-free and high efficient intelligent algorithm for communication
problems and proved useful in the communication network. However, when coming
to large-scale networks with limited centralization, it is not possible to
employ a centralized entity to perform joint real-time decision making for
entire network. This introduces the scalability challenges, while multi-agent
reinforcement shows the opportunity to cope this challenges and extend the
intelligent algorithm to cooperative large-scale network. In this paper, we
introduce the federated mean-field multi-agent reinforcement learning structure
to capture the problem in large scale multi-agent communication scenarios,
where agents share parameters to form consistency. We present the theoretical
basis of our architecture and show the influence of federated frequency with an
informational multi-agent model. We then exam the performance of our
architecture with a coordinated multi-point environment which requires
handshakes between neighbour access-points to realise the cooperation gain. Our
result shows that the learning structure can effectively solve the cooperation
problem in a large scale network with decent scalability. We also show the
effectiveness of federated algorithms and highlight the importance of
maintaining personality in each access-point.

media are well known to form a heterogeneous distribution with filamentary
patterns. Better understanding these forces and the distribution is important
for predicting the collective behavior of granular media, the media second only
to water as the most manipulated material in global industry. However, studies
in this regard so far have been largely confined to granular media exhibiting
only geometric heterogeneity, leaving the dimension of mechanical heterogeneity
a rather uncharted area. Here, through a FEM contact mechanics model, we show
that a heterogeneous inter-particle force distribution can also emerge from the
dimension of mechanical heterogeneity alone. Specifically, we numerically study
inter-particle forces in packing of mechanically heterogeneous disks arranged
over either a square or a hexagonal lattice and under quasi-static isotropic
compression. Our results show that, a hexagonal packing exhibit a more
heterogeneous inter-particle force distribution than a square packing does. For
both packing lattices, preliminary analysis shows the consistent coexistence of
outliers (i.e., softer disks sustaining larger forces while stiffer disks
sustaining smaller forces) in comparison to their homogeneous counterparts,
which implies the existence of nonlocal effect. Further analysis on the portion
of outliers and on spatial contact force correlations suggest that the
hexagonal packing shows more pronounced nonlocal effect over the square packing
under small mechanical heterogeneity. However, such trend is reversed when
assemblies becomes more mechanically heterogeneous. Lastly, we confirm that, in
the absence of particle reorganization events, contact friction merely plays
the role of packing stabilization while its variation has little effect on
inter-particle forces and their distribution.

complementary attributes of recent advances in deep learning for segmentation
and robust feature extraction, as well as memory-augmented pose graph
optimization for spatiotemporal consistency. This enables long-term, low-drift
tracking under various challenging scenarios, including significant occlusions
and object motions. Comprehensive experiments given two public benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-art,
category-level 6D tracking or dynamic SLAM methods. When compared against
state-of-art methods that rely on an object instance CAD model, comparable

descend from those who migrated from, a high-saving environment to a
low-savings, high-debt environment. We also compare behavior in the presence

mandatory insurance. Our respondents exhibit behavior in the saving task that

in typical spaceflight missions, ground-based low-gravity simulators have
become indispensable for preparing spaceflight experiments and for serving as
stand-alone research platforms. Among various simulator systems, the magnetic
levitation based simulator (MLS) has received long-lasting interests due to its
easily adjustable gravity and practically unlimited operation time. However, a
recognized issue with MLSs is their highly non-uniform force field. For a
solenoid MLS, the functional volume $V_{1\%}$, where the net force results in
an acceleration less than 1\% of the Earth's gravity $g$, is typically a few
microliters ($\mu L$) or less. In this work, we report an innovative MLS design
that integrates a superconducting magnet with a gradient-field Maxwell coil.
Through an optimization analysis, we show that an unprecedented $V_{1\%}$ of
over 4,000 $\mu L$ can be achieved in a compact coil with a diameter of 8 cm.
We also discuss how such an MLS can be made using existing high-$T_c$
superconducting materials. When the current in this MLS is reduced to emulate
the gravity on Mars ($g_M=0.38g$), a functional volume where the gravity varies
within a few percent of $g_M$ can exceed 20,000 $\mu L$. Our design may break

transformations, ReLU, and normalization. To evaluate our cell's effectiveness,
we compare its performance against the widely-used GRU and LSTM cells and the
recently proposed Mogrifier LSTM on several tasks including, polyphonic music

RRU outperforms the traditional gated units on most of these tasks. Also, it
has better robustness to parameter selection, allowing immediate application in
new tasks without much tuning. We have implemented the RRU in TensorFlow, and

research examines the optimal strategies for operating integrated energy
systems consisting of renewable energy production and hydrogen storage. Using
Markov decision process theory, we construct optimal policies for day-to-day
decisions on how much energy to store as hydrogen, or buy from or sell to the
electricity market, and on how much hydrogen to sell for use as gas. We pay
special emphasis to practical settings, such as contractually binding power
purchase agreements, varying electricity prices, different distribution
channels, green hydrogen offtake agreements, and hydrogen market price
uncertainties. Extensive experiments and analysis are performed in the context
of Northern Netherlands where Europe's first Hydrogen Valley is being formed.
Results show that substantial gains in operational revenues of up to 51\% are
possible by introducing hydrogen storage units and competitive hydrogen
market-prices. This amounts to a \euro 126,000 increase in revenues per turbine

characterizing observations in which embryonic or induced stem cells of animals
replicate morphological steps and outcomes seen in intact embryos. While the
term was introduced in the 18th century by the philosopher Immanuel Kant to
describe the goal-directed properties of living systems, it came into modern
use for non-living materials in which complex forms and patterns emerge through
dynamical, energy-expending physical processes. What is the relationship among
these uses of the term? While multicellular forms arose dozens of times from
single-celled organisms, only some of these undergo development, and not all
developmental processes are self-organizing. The evolution of the animals
(metazoans) from unicellular holozoans was accompanied by the addition of novel
gene products which mediated the constitution the resulting cell clusters as
liquid-, liquid crystal-, and solid-like materials with versatile morphogenetic
propensities. Such materials variously exhibited multilayering, lumen formation
and elongation, echoing the self-organizing properties of nonliving matter,
""generic"" based on such parallels, though with biologically based subunit
properties and modes of interaction. These effects provided evolutionary
templates for embryonic forms and morphological motifs of metazoan lineages.
Embryos and organ primordia of present-day animal species continue to generate
forms that resemble the outcomes of these physical effects. Their development,
however, employs overdetermined, highly evolved mechanisms that are often
disconnected from their originating processes. Using the examples of
gastrulation, somitogenesis, and limb skeletal development, I provide instances
of, and a conceptual framework for understanding, the relationships between
transparently physical and evolved types of developmental self-organization.

  Results: The PS-OCT system was capable of imaging the entire equine
osteochondral unit, and allowed delineation of the three structurally
differentiated zones of the joint, that is, the articular cartilage matrix,
zone of calcified cartilage and underlying subchondral bone. Importantly,
PS-OCT imaging was able to detect underlying matrix and bone changes not
visible without dissection and/or microscopy.
  Conclusion: PS-OCT has substantial potential to detect, non-invasively,
sub-surface microstructural changes that are known to be associated with the
early stages of joint tissue degeneration.

require sampling over a Hubbard-Stratonovich field $h$ introduced to decouple
the interactions. The weight for a given configuration involves the products of
the determinant of matrices $M_\sigma(h)$, where $\sigma$ labels the species,
and hence is typically not positive definite. Indeed, the average sign $\langle
{\cal S} \rangle$ of the determinants goes to zero exponentially with
increasing spatial size and decreasing temperature for most Hamiltonians of
interest. This statement, however, does not explicitly separate two possible
origins for the vanishing of $\langle {\cal S} \rangle$. Does $\langle {\cal S}
\rangle \rightarrow 0$ because {\it randomly} chosen field configurations have
${\rm det}\big(M(h)\big) < 0$, or does the `sign problem' arise because the
specific subset of configurations chosen by the weighting function have a
greater preponderance of negative values? In the latter case, the process of
weighting the configurations with $|{\rm det}\big(M(h)\big)|$ might steer the
simulation to a region of configuration space of $h$ where positive and
negative determinants are equally likely, even though randomly chosen $h$ would
preferentially have determinants with a single dominant sign. In this paper we
address the relative importance of these two mechanisms for the vanishing of

flow model, which is composed of the phasic mass and total energy equations,
one volume fraction equation, and the mixture momentum equation. The model
contains relaxation source terms accounting for volume, heat and mass transfer.
The equations are numerically solved via a fractional step algorithm, where we
alternate between the solution of the homogeneous hyperbolic portion of the
system via a HLLC-type wave propagation scheme, and the solution of a sequence
of three systems of ordinary differential equations for the relaxation source
terms driving the flow toward mechanical, thermal and chemical equilibrium. In
the literature often numerical relaxation procedures are based on simplifying
assumptions, namely simple equations of state, such as the stiffened gas one,
and instantaneous relaxation processes. These simplifications of the flow
physics might be inadequate for the description of the thermodynamical
processes involved in various flow problems. In the present work we introduce
new numerical relaxation techniques with two significant properties: the
capability to describe heat and mass transfer processes of arbitrary relaxation
time, and the applicability to a general equation of state. We show the
effectiveness of the proposed methods by presenting several numerical

infrastructure for chip multiprocessors (CMPs) and many-core systems. The
commonly used parallel applications and emerging machine learning-based
applications involve a significant amount of collective communication patterns.
In CMP applications, multicast is widely used in multithreaded programs and
protocols for barrier/clock synchronization and cache coherence. Multicast
routing plays an important role on the system performance of a CMP. Existing
partition-based multicast routing algorithms all use static destination set
partition strategy which lacks the global view of path optimization. In this
paper, we propose an efficient Dynamic Partition Merging (DPM)-based multicast
routing algorithm. The proposed algorithm divides the multicast destination set
into partitions dynamically by comparing the routing cost of different
partition merging options and selecting the merged partitions with lower cost.
The simulation results of synthetic traffic and PARSEC benchmark applications
confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing path-based routing
algorithms. The proposed algorithm is able to improve up to 23\% in average
packet latency and 14\% in power consumption against the existing multipath
routing algorithm when tested in PARSEC benchmark workloads.

and high-performance deep neural networks (DNNs). As the performance
requirements of ML applications grow continuously, the hardware accelerators
start playing a central role in DNN design. This trend makes NAS even more
complicated and time-consuming for most real applications. This paper proposes
FLASH, a very fast NAS methodology that co-optimizes the DNN accuracy and
performance on a real hardware platform. As the main theoretical contribution,
we first propose the NN-Degree, an analytical metric to quantify the
topological characteristics of DNNs with skip connections (e.g., DenseNets,
ResNets, Wide-ResNets, and MobileNets). The newly proposed NN-Degree allows us
to do training-free NAS within one second and build an accuracy predictor by
training as few as 25 samples out of a vast search space with more than 63
billion configurations. Second, by performing inference on the target hardware,
we fine-tune and validate our analytical models to estimate the latency, area,
and energy consumption of various DNN architectures while executing standard ML
datasets. Third, we construct a hierarchical algorithm based on simplicial
homology global optimization (SHGO) to optimize the model-architecture
co-design process, while considering the area, latency, and energy consumption
of the target hardware. We demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art
NAS approaches, our proposed hierarchical SHGO-based algorithm enables more
than four orders of magnitude speedup (specifically, the execution time of the
proposed algorithm is about 0.1 seconds). Finally, our experimental evaluations
show that FLASH is easily transferable to different hardware architectures,
thus enabling us to do NAS on a Raspberry Pi-3B processor in less than 3
seconds.

  Quantification",,,,,"cs.AR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Statistical machine learning has widespread application in various domains.
These methods include probabilistic algorithms, such as Markov Chain
Monte-Carlo (MCMC), which rely on generating random numbers from probability
distributions. These algorithms are computationally expensive on conventional
processors, yet their statistical properties, namely interpretability and
uncertainty quantification (UQ) compared to deep learning, make them an
attractive alternative approach. Therefore, hardware specialization can be
adopted to address the shortcomings of conventional processors in running these
applications.
  In this paper, we propose a high-throughput accelerator for Markov Random
Field (MRF) inference, a powerful model for representing a wide range of
applications, using MCMC with Gibbs sampling. We propose a tiled architecture
which takes advantage of near-memory computing, and memory optimizations
tailored to the semantics of MRF. Additionally, we propose a novel hybrid
on-chip/off-chip memory system and logging scheme to efficiently support UQ.
This memory system design is not specific to MRF models and is applicable to
applications using probabilistic algorithms. In addition, it dramatically
reduces off-chip memory bandwidth requirements.
  We implemented an FPGA prototype of our proposed architecture using
high-level synthesis tools and achieved 146MHz frequency for an accelerator
with 32 function units on an Intel Arria 10 FPGA. Compared to prior work on
FPGA, our accelerator achieves 26X speedup. Furthermore, our proposed memory
system and logging scheme to support UQ reduces off-chip bandwidth by 71% for
two applications. ASIC analysis in 15nm shows our design with 2048 function
units running at 3GHz outperforms GPU implementations of motion estimation and
stereo vision on Nvidia RTX2080Ti by 120X-210X, occupying only 7.7% of the

using the volume of fluid method. The analysis is performed for different
volume fractions and viscosity ratios under the assumption of negligible
inertia and zero buoyancy force. Several carrier fluids are considered
encompassing both the shear-thinning and thickening behaviors. We show that the
effective viscosity of the system increases for shear-thickening fluids and
decreases for the shear-thinning ones for all the viscosity ratios considered.
The changes in the emulsion viscosity are mainly due to modifications of the
coalescence in the system obtained by changing the carrier fluid property:
indeed, local large and low shear rates are found in the regions between two
interacting droplets for shear-thickening and thinning fluids, respectively,
resulting in increased and reduced local viscosity which ultimately affects the
drainage time of the system. This process is independent of the nominal
viscosity ratio of the two fluids and we show that it can not be understood by
considering only the mean shear rate and viscosity of the two fluids across the

frequency support is provided by modifying the parametrized power versus rotor
speed curve, including the inertia power versus rotor speed curve and the droop
power versus rotor speed curve. The advantage of the proposed scheme is that it
does not contain any control gains and generally adapts to different wind
speeds. Further, the proposed scheme can work for the whole section of wind
speed without wind speed measurement information. The compared simulation
results demonstrate the scheme improves the system frequency response while
ensuring the stable operation of doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs)-based
variable-speed wind turbines (VSWTs) under various wind conditions.
Furthermore, the scheme prevents rotor speed overdeceleration even when the
wind speed decreases during frequency regulation control.

theory, which has received a lot of attention from researchers in recent years.
It is generally very hard to show a given graph to be determined by its
spectrum. Recently, Wang [10] gave a simple arithmetic condition for graphs
being determined by their generalized spectra. Let $G$ be a graph with
adjacency matrix $A$ on $n$ vertices, and $W=[e,Ae,\ldots,A^{n-1}e]$ ($e$ is
the all-one vector) be the walk-matrix of $G$. A theorem of Wang [10] states
that if $2^{-\lfloor n/2\rfloor}\det W$ (which is always an integer) is odd and
square-free, then $G$ is determined by the generalized spectrum. In this paper,
we find a new and short route which leads to a stronger version of the above
theorem. The result is achieved by using the Smith Normal Form of the
walk-matrix of $G$. The proposed method gives a new insight in dealing with the

neural network models for multiple correlated tasks. Often the task objectives
conflict, requiring trade-offs between them during model building. In such
cases, MTL models can use gradient-based multi-objective optimization (MOO) to
find one or more Pareto optimal solutions. A common requirement in MTL
applications is to find an {\it Exact} Pareto optimal (EPO) solution, which
satisfies user preferences with respect to task-specific objective functions.
Further, to improve model generalization, various constraints on the weights
may need to be enforced during training. Addressing these requirements is
challenging because it requires a search direction that allows descent not only
towards the Pareto front but also towards the input preference, within the
constraints imposed and in a manner that scales to high-dimensional gradients.
We design and theoretically analyze such search directions and develop the
first scalable algorithm, with theoretical guarantees of convergence, to find
an EPO solution, including when box and equality constraints are imposed. Our
unique method combines multiple gradient descent with carefully controlled
ascent to traverse the Pareto front in a principled manner, making it robust to
initialization. This also facilitates systematic exploration of the Pareto
front, that we utilize to approximate the Pareto front for multi-criteria
decision-making. Empirical results show that our algorithm outperforms
competing methods on benchmark MTL datasets and MOO problems.

substantial co-channel interference (CCI). In such orthogonal frequency
division multiple access (OFDMA) cellular systems, the inter-sector or
inter-tower interference (ITI) makes accurate signal recovery quite challenging
as sub-1 GHz bands only support single-input single-output (SISO) links.
Interference-aware receiver algorithms are essential to mitigate the ITI in
such low-frequency bands. Such algorithms enable ubiquitous mobile broadband
access over the entire homeland, say with >95% geographical coverage with
quality of service guarantees. One element of the interference-aware signal
recovery is the least-squares-based joint channel estimation scheme that uses
non-orthogonal pilot subcarriers. This estimator is then compared with a
variant that uses orthogonal pilot subcarriers to bring out the advantage of
this joint estimator. It is shown that the proposed joint estimator requires
fewer pilots to be well-determined when compared to its under-determined
orthogonal counterpart. Moreover, it is easy to implement and does not require
any knowledge of channel statistics. This work also derives a compensation
factor needed for the interference-aware detector in the presence of
inter-carrier interference (ICI) originating from multiple transmitters.
Simulation results show that the proposed joint channel estimator outperforms
traditional estimators at moderate to high frequency selectivity. The proposed
compensation factor to the joint detector is found to be essential for
recovering the transmitted signal in the absence of phase-tracking pilots.

objectives, namely unbalanced graph generative adversarial network (UG-GAN), is
designed to generate synthetic three-phase unbalanced active distribution
system connectivity. The basic idea is to learn the distribution of random
walks both over a real-world system and across each phase of line segments,
capturing the underlying local properties of an individual real-world
distribution network and generating specific synthetic networks accordingly.
Then, to create a comprehensive synthetic test case, a network correction and
extension process is proposed to obtain time-series nodal demands and standard
distribution grid components with realistic parameters, including distributed
energy resources (DERs) and capacity banks. A Midwest distribution system with
1-year SM data has been utilized to validate the performance of our method.
Case studies with several power applications demonstrate that synthetic active

students' ability to keep up with the pace of instruction in a university level
physics course, with a focus on the heterogeneous impact of remote learning on
different demographic groups. Student learning data is collected from 70 online
learning modules assigned as both online homework and self-study material in
both Fall 2020 and Spring 2020 semesters, with the first 41 modules being
assigned before campus closure in Spring 2020. Students' ability to stay on
track is measured by three data indicators: percentage of modules submitted
before the due date, percentage of modules submitted early for extra credit,
and percentage of modules properly engaged with. The student population is
divided into two demographic groups according to each of the four demographic
variables: Gender, Ethnicity, Transfer Status and First generation status. All
three data indicators from both semesters are first compared between each pair
of demographic groups within the same semester, and then compared within the
same group between the two semesters. Exam and course scores are also compared
between demographics groups in Fall 2020 and against scores from the Fall 2019
semester. The analysis revealed that remote learning significantly reduced
on-time and early submission for first-generation students, but increased the
frequency of early submission for transfer students. Under-represented minority
students had higher percentage of engaged modules during the pandemic, while
non-URM students had the same level of module engagement before and after the
pandemic. These results suggest that pandemic remote learning had very
different impact for students with different demographic background, and future
instructional design should strive to provide more flexible options to meet the
various needs for a diverse higher-ed student population.

detecting generic or individual types of edges, it remains under-explored to
comprehensively study all four edge types together. In this paper, we propose a
novel neural network solution, RINDNet, to jointly detect all four types of
edges. Taking into consideration the distinct attributes of each type of edges
and the relationship between them, RINDNet learns effective representations for
each of them and works in three stages. In stage I, RINDNet uses a common
backbone to extract features shared by all edges. Then in stage II it branches
to prepare discriminative features for each edge type by the corresponding
decoder. In stage III, an independent decision head for each type aggregates
the features from previous stages to predict the initial results. Additionally,
an attention module learns attention maps for all types to capture the
underlying relations between them, and these maps are combined with initial
results to generate the final edge detection results. For training and
evaluation, we construct the first public benchmark, BSDS-RIND, with all four
types of edges carefully annotated. In our experiments, RINDNet yields
promising results in comparison with state-of-the-art methods. Additional

the thermodynamics of the above-mentioned model for several values of k and its
correlation with the dynamics. We surprisingly find that the usual
thermodynamic integration (TI) method of calculating the entropy provides
unphysical results for this model. It predicts the vanishing of configurational
entropy at state points at which both the collective and the single-particle
dynamics of the system show complete relaxation. We then employ a new method
known as the two-phase thermodynamics (2PT) method to calculate the entropy. We
find that with an increase in k the difference in the entropy computed using
the two methods (2PT and TI) increases. We also find that in the temperature
range studied, the entropy calculated via the 2PT method satisfies the
Adam-Gibbs (AG) relationship between the relaxation time and the
configurational entropy, whereas the entropy calculated via the TI method shows
a strong violation of the same. We then apply the 2PT method to calculate the
entropy in another system where some fractions of particles are pinned randomly
in their equilibrium positions. This system also shows a similar breakdown of
the AG relationship as reported earlier. We show that the difference in entropy

work, we put this parameter through a stringent test and study the causal
relationship between this softness parameter at the local level and the local
dynamics. We first extend the earlier study to describe the local softness. We
find a distribution of the softness value where the distribution has reasonably
strong temperature dependence. This shows that the parameter can identify the
local structural heterogeneity. We then study the lifetime of the softness
parameter and show that its lifetime is connected to the well-known cage
structure in the supercooled liquids. Finally, our theory predicts that the
local softness and the local dynamics is causal below the onset temperature
where there is a decoupling between the short and long time dynamics, thus
allowing a static description of the cage. We find that at lower temperatures,
the structural heterogeneity increases, and also, the structure becomes a
better predictor of the dynamics, thus giving rise to dynamic heterogeneity. We
also find that the softness of a hard, immobile region evolves with time and
becomes soft and eventually mobile due to the rearrangements in the

spaces, introduced by J. Mach [Continuity properties of Chebyshev centers, J.
Approx. Theory, 29(3):223--230, 1980] as property-$(P_1)$. We establish that if
the closed unit ball of a closed subspace of a Banach space $X$ possesses
property-$(P_1)$ for each of the classes of closed bounded, compact and finite
subsets of $X$, then so does the subspace. It is also proved that the closed
unit ball of an $M$-ideal in an $L_{1}$-predual space satisfies
property-$(P_{1})$ for the compact subsets of the space. For a Choquet simplex
$K$, we provide a sufficient condition for the closed unit ball of a finite
co-dimensional closed subspace of $A(K)$ to satisfy property-$(P_{1})$ for the
compact subsets of $A(K)$. This condition also helps to establish the
equivalence of strong proximinality of the closed unit ball of a finite
co-dimensional subspace of $A(K)$ and property-$(P_{1})$ of the closed unit
ball of the subspace for the compact subsets of $A(K)$. Further, for a compact
Hausdorff space $S$, a characterization is provided for a strongly proximinal
finite co-dimensional closed subspace of $C(S)$ in terms of property-$(P_{1})$
of the subspace and that of its closed unit ball for the compact subsets of
$C(S)$. We generalize this characterization for a strongly proximinal finite
co-dimensional closed subspace of an $L_{1}$-predual space. As a consequence,
we prove that such a subspace is a finite intersection of hyperplanes such that
the closed unit ball of each of these hyperplanes satisfy property-$(P_1)$ for
the compact subsets of the $L_1$-predual space and vice versa. We conclude this
article by providing an example of a closed subspace of a non-reflexive Banach
space which satisfies $1 \frac{1}{2}$-ball property and does not admit
restricted Chebyshev centre for a closed bounded subset of the Banach space.

interact or instruct with the viewers directly but use chat-bot and autonomous
interaction to alleviated the interaction burden. Unique sessions like

especially those employing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). Chaotic
sensing is one such methodology that employs deterministic, fractal sampling in
conjunction with finite, iterative reconstruction schemes to form an image from
limited samples. Using a sampling pattern constructed entirely from periodic
lines in DFT space, chaotic sensing was found to outperform traditional
compressed sensing for magnetic resonance imaging; however, only one such
sampling pattern was presented and the reason for its fractal nature was not
proven. Through the introduction of a novel image transform known as the
kaleidoscope transform, which formalises and extends upon the concept of
downsampling and concatenating an image with itself, this paper: (1)
demonstrates a fundamental relationship between multiplication in modular
arithmetic and downsampling; (2) provides a rigorous mathematical explanation
for the fractal nature of the sampling pattern in the DFT; and (3) leverages
this understanding to develop a collection of novel fractal sampling patterns
for the 2D DFT with customisable properties. The ability to design tailor-made
fractal sampling patterns expands the utility of the DFT in chaotic imaging and
may form the basis for a bespoke chaotic sensing methodology, in which the
fractal sampling matches the imaging task for improved reconstruction.

in Dense Retrieval (DR), which performs first-stage retrieval with
embedding-based search. Despite the impressive ranking performance, previous
studies usually adopt brute-force search to acquire candidates, which is
prohibitive in practical Web search scenarios due to its tremendous memory
usage and time cost. To overcome these problems, vector compression methods
have been adopted in many practical embedding-based retrieval applications. One
of the most popular methods is Product Quantization (PQ). However, although
existing vector compression methods including PQ can help improve the
efficiency of DR, they incur severely decayed retrieval performance due to the
separation between encoding and compression. To tackle this problem, we present
JPQ, which stands for Joint optimization of query encoding and Product
Quantization. It trains the query encoder and PQ index jointly in an end-to-end
manner based on three optimization strategies, namely ranking-oriented loss, PQ
centroid optimization, and end-to-end negative sampling. We evaluate JPQ on two
publicly available retrieval benchmarks. Experimental results show that JPQ
significantly outperforms popular vector compression methods. Compared with
previous DR models that use brute-force search, JPQ almost matches the best
retrieval performance with 30x compression on index size. The compressed index
further brings 10x speedup on CPU and 2x speedup on GPU in query latency.

orderings/liquids, which are tunable by external stimuli, is a remarkable
feature of correlated electron systems, but has rarely been realized in the
topological semimetals with high-mobility relativistic electrons. Here, we
report that the correlated Dirac electrons with the Mott criticality in
perovskite CaIrO$_3$ show unconventional field-induced successive
metal-insulator-metal crossovers in the quantum limit accompanying a giant
magnetoresistance (MR) with MR ratio of 3,500 % (18 T and 1.4 K). The analysis
shows that the insulating state originates from the collective electronic
ordering such as charge/spin density wave promoted by electron correlation,
whereas it turns into the quasi-one-dimensional metal at higher fields due to
the field-induced reduction of chemical potential, highlighting the highly
field-sensitive character of correlated Dirac electrons.

Based on a self-consistency method adjusted to periodically driven systems, we
obtain stationary states associated with topological phases unique to Floquet
systems. In addition, we study the linear stability of these edge states and
reveal that Floquet stationary edge states experience a sort of transition
between two regions I and II, in which lifetimes of these edge states are
extremely long and short, respectively. We characterize the transitions in
lifetimes by Krein signatures or equivalently the pseudo-Hermiticity breaking,
and clarify that the transitions between regions I and II are signified by
collisions of edge-dominant eigenstates of Floquet operators for fluctuations.
We also analyze the effects of random potentials and clarify that lifetimes of
various stationary edge states are equalized due to the randomness-induced
mixing of edge- and bulk-dominant eigenstates. This intriguing phenomenon
originating from a competition between the nonlinearity and randomness results
in that random potentials prolong lifetimes in the region II and vice versa in
the region I. These changes of lifetimes induced by nonlinear and/or random
effects should be detectable in experiments by preparing initial states akin to
the edge states.

electron annihilation in the positron cloud of QNs cannot explain the observed

captures protons which annihilate with anti-quarks in the quark core or
transform to neutrons thus reducing the QN core charge and increasing QN
temperature. As a result QN loses positrons to space which annihilate with
electrons there. Even more positrons are produced from charged pions resulting
from the proton annihilation. Another manifestation may be emission of photons

VMP DLAs from over 30 years of literature, most with high resolution spectral

the DLA abundance ratios of C, N, O, Al, Si, S, and Fe (over Fe and O). We
assume that the DLAs are metal-poor enough that they represent galaxies in
their earliest stages of evolution, when CCSNe are the only nucleosynthetic
sources of the metals we analyze. We compare five sets of zero- and
low-metallicity theoretical yields to the empirical yields derived in this
work. We find that the five models agree with the DLA yields for ratios
containing Si and S. Only one model, Heger & Woosley (2010, hereafter HW10),
reproduced the DLA values for N, and one other model, Limongi & Chieffi (2018,

yields with the adoption of a SN explosion landscape (where certain progenitor
masses collapse into black holes, contributing no yields) onto HW10, but fixing
explosion energy to progenitor mass results in wide disagreements between the
predictions and DLA abundances. We investigate the adoption of a simple,
observationally motivated Initial Distribution of Rotational Velocities for
LC18 and find a slight improvement.

setups, Wi-Fi-based human behavior sensing leveraging Channel State Information
(CSI) measurements has received a lot of research attention in recent years.
The CSI-based human sensing algorithms typically either rely on an explicit
channel propagation model or, more recently, adopt machine learning so as to
robustify feature extraction. In most related work, the considered CSI is
extracted from a single dedicated Access Point (AP) communication setup. In
this paper, we consider a more realistic setting where a legacy network of
multiple APs is already deployed for communications purposes and leveraged for
sensing benefits using machine learning. The use of legacy network presents
challenges and opportunities as many Wi-Fi links can present with richer yet
unequally useful data sets. In order to break the curse of dimensionality
associated with training over a too large dimensional CSI, we propose a link
selection mechanism based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) which allows for
dimension reduction while preserving the data that is most relevant for human
behavior sensing. The method is based on a sequential state decision-making
process in which the CSI is modeled as a part of the state. From actual
experiment results, our method is shown to perform better than state-of-the-art
approaches in a scenario with multiple available Wi-Fi links.

room-temperature solid refrigerants. Although lots of studies have been carried
out on how to tune this transformation and obtain large entropy change in a
wide temperature region, the crystallography of this martensitic transformation
is still unknown. The biggest obstacle for crystallography investigation is to
obtain a bulk sample, in which hexagonal and orthorhombic phases coexist,
because the MnMX alloys will fragment into powders after experiencing the
transformation. For this reason, we carefully tune the transformation
temperature to be slightly below 300 K. In that case, a bulk sample with small
amounts of orthorhombic phases distributed in hexagonal matrix is obtained.
Most importantly, there are no cracks between the two phases. It facilities us
to investigate the microstructure using electron microscope. The obtained
results indicate that the orientation relationship between hexagonal and
orthorhombic structures is [4-2-23]h//[120]o & (01-10)h//(001)o and the habit
plane is {-2113.26}h. WLR theory is also adopted to calculate the habit plane.
The calculated result agrees well with the measured one. Our work reveals the
crystallography of hexagonal-orthorhombic transformation for the first time and
is helpful for understanding the transformation-associated physical effects in
MnMX alloys.

iterative algorithms are sensitive to initialization and little noise can lead
to failure in convergence. Hence, research has focused on algebraic techniques.
Stable and efficient algebraic solvers have been proposed for some network
configurations, but they do not work for smaller networks. In this paper, we
use homotopy continuation to solve four previously unsolved configurations in
2D TDOA self-calibration, including a minimal one. As a theoretical
contribution, we investigate the number of solutions of the new minimal
configuration, showing this is much lower than previous estimates. As a more
practical contribution, we also present new subminimal solvers, which can be
used to achieve unique accurate solutions in previously unsolvable
configurations. We demonstrate our solvers are stable both with clean and noisy

vulnerabilities. However, such detectors' robustness is unclear. In this paper,
we initiate the study in this aspect by demonstrating that DL-based detectors
are not robust against simple code transformations, dubbed attacks in this
paper, as these transformations may be leveraged for malicious purposes. As a
first step towards making DL-based detectors robust against such attacks, we
propose an innovative framework, dubbed ZigZag, which is centered at (i)
decoupling feature learning and classifier learning and (ii) using a
ZigZag-style strategy to iteratively refine them until they converge to robust
features and robust classifiers. Experimental results show that the ZigZag
framework can substantially improve the robustness of DL-based detectors.

wave (GW) event GW170817 opened the era of multi-messenger astronomy with GWs
and provided the first direct evidence that at least a fraction of binary
neutron star (BNS) mergers are progenitors of short Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs).
GRBs are also expected to emit very-high energy (VHE, > 100 GeV) photons, as
proven by the recent MAGIC and H.E.S.S. observations. One of the challenges for
future multi-messenger observations will be the detection of such VHE emission
from GRBs in association with GWs. In the next years, the Cherenkov Telescope
Array (CTA) will be a key instrument for the EM follow-up of GW events in the
VHE range, owing to its unprecedented sensitivity, rapid response, and
capability to monitor a large sky area via scan-mode operation. We present the
CTA GW follow-up program, with a focus on the searches for short GRBs possibly
associated with BNS mergers. We investigate the possible observational
strategies and we outline the prospects for the detection of VHE EM

chaotic time series prediction and continuous speech recognition thanks to its
unique combination of high computational power and low training cost which sets
it aside from alternatives such as traditionally trained recurrent neural
networks, and furthermore is amenable to implementations in dedicated hardware,
potentially leading to extremely compact and efficient reservoir computers.
Recently the use of random quantum systems has been proposed, leveraging the
complexity of quantum dynamics for classical time series processing. Extracting
the output from a quantum system without disturbing its state too much is
problematic however, and can be expected to become a bottleneck in such
approaches. Here we propose a reservoir computing inspired approach to online
processing of time series consisting of quantum information, sidestepping the
measurement problem. We illustrate its power by generalizing two paradigmatic
benchmark tasks from classical reservoir computing to quantum information and
introducing a task without a classical analogue where a random system is
trained to both create and distribute entanglement between systems that never
directly interact. Finally, we discuss partial generalizations where only the

control of its deformations that could affect the pointing accuracy and its
overall performance. According to CTA specifications that are conceived to
resolve e.g. the fine structure of galactic sources, the LST post-calibration
pointing accuracy should be better than 14 arcseconds. To fulfill this
requirement, the telescope pointing precision is monitored with two dedicated
CCD cameras located at the dish center. The analysis of their images allows us
to disentangle different systematic deformations of the structure. In this
work, we investigate a complementary approach that offers the possibility to
monitor the pointing of the telescope during the acquisition of sky data. After
properly cleaning the events from the Cherenkov showers, the reconstructed
positions of the stars imaged in the camera field of view are compared to their
nominal expected positions in catalogues. This provides a direct measurement of
the telescope pointing, that can be used to cross-check the other methods and
as a real-time monitoring of the optical properties of the telescope and of the
pointing corrections applied by the bending models. Additionally, this method
benefits from not relying on specific hardware or dedicated observations. In

perhaps partial, searches to expedite subsequent path planning tasks. In this
article, we are interested in developing incremental graph search algorithms
for path finding problems to simultaneously optimize multiple objectives such
as travel risk, arrival time, etc. This is challenging because in a
multi-objective setting, the number of ""Pareto-optimal"" solutions can grow
exponentially with respect to the size of the graph. This article presents a
new multi-objective incremental search algorithm called Multi-Objective
Path-Based D* Lite (MOPBD*) which leverages a path-based expansion strategy to
prune dominated solutions. Additionally, we introduce a sub-optimal variant of
MOPBD* to improve search efficiency while approximating the Pareto-optimal
front. We numerically evaluate the performance of MOPBD* and its variants in
various maps with two and three objectives. Results show that our approach is
more efficient than search from scratch, and runs up to an order of magnitude
faster than the existing incremental method for multi-objective path planning.

Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) to target the CO(3-2) emission
line and report non-detections for all three hosts. These are used to place
limits on the host molecular gas masses, assuming a metallicity-dependent
CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor ($\alpha_{\rm CO}$). We find, $M_{\rm mol} <
3.5\times 10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$ (GRB\,080607), $M_{\rm mol} < 4.7\times
10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$ (GRB\,120815A), and $M_{\rm mol} < 8.9\times
10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$ (GRB\,181020A). The high limits on the molecular gas mass
for the latter two cases are a consequence of their low stellar masses
$M_\star$ ($M_\star \lesssim 10^{8}\,M_{\odot}$) and low gas-phase
metallicities ($Z\sim 0.03\,Z_{\odot}$). The limit on the $M_{\rm mol}/M_\star$
ratio derived for GRB\,080607, however, is consistent with the average
population of star-forming galaxies at similar redshifts and stellar masses. We
discuss the broader implications for a metallicity-dependent CO-to-H$_2$
conversion factor, and demonstrate that the canonical Galactic $\alpha_{\rm
CO}$, will severely underestimate the actual molecular gas mass for all
galaxies at $z>1$ with $M_\star < 10^{10}\,M_\odot$. To better quantify this we
develop a simple approach to estimate the relevant $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ factor
based only on the redshift and stellar mass of individual galaxies. The
elevated conversion factors will make these galaxies appear CO-""dark"" and
difficult to detect in emission, as is the case for the majority of GRB hosts.
GRB spectroscopy thus offers a complementary approach to identify
low-metallicity, star-forming galaxies with abundant molecular gas reservoirs
at high redshifts that are otherwise missed by current ALMA surveys.

gimbals or sensors on robots may suffer from a limited field of view or be

the two tasks can be carried out at the same time. By integrating the parallel

such as Gaussian Elimination, the Routh--Hurwitz Criterion, and the Euclidean
Algorithm for GCD of polynomials indeed allow for an algorithm that is
polynomial in the bit size of the instance. However, all these tools have to be
implemented with care, and in a non-standard way, which relies on an advanced
analysis.

thermal Comptonisation with seed photons originating in the accretion disc; in
the second one, we adopted a disc-blackbody and a Comptonisation with a
blackbody-shaped spectrum of the incoming seed photons. A power-law fitting the
high energy emission above 20 keV was also required in both cases. The two
models provide the same physical scenario for the source in both the branches:
a blackbody temperature between 0.8 and 1.5 keV, a disc-blackbody with
temperature between 0.4 and 0.6 keV, and an optically thick Comptonising corona
with optical depth between 6 and 10 and temperature about 3 keV. Furthermore,
two lines related to the K$\alpha$ and K$\beta$ transitions of the He-like Fe
XXV ions were detected at 6.6 keV and 7.8 keV, respectively. A hard tail
modelled by a power law with a photon index between 2 and 3 was also required

heterogeneity on COTS heterogeneous embedded platforms as a first-class

distinct extra-functional behaviour. This enables the system designer to
quickly explore different scheduling policies and task-to-core mappings, and
thus, to improve overall system performance. In this paper, we present the

defines shortest geodesic paths interpolating two images as minimizers of the
path energy which measures the viscous dissipation caused by the motion field
and dissipation caused by the material derivative of the image intensity along
motion paths. In this paper, we aim at smooth interpolation of multiple key
frame images picking up the general observation of cubic splines in Euclidean
space which minimize the squared acceleration along the interpolation path. To
this end, we propose the spline functional which combines quadratic functionals
of the Eulerian motion acceleration and of the second material derivative of
the image intensity as the proper notion of image intensity acceleration. We
propose a variational time discretization of this model and study the
convergence to a suitably relaxed time continuous model via
$\Gamma$-convergence methodology. As a byproduct, this also allows to establish
the existence of metamorphosis splines for given key frame images as minimizers
of the time continuous spline functional. The time discretization is
complemented by effective spatial discretization based on finite differences
and a stable B-spline interpolation of deformed quantities. A variety of
numerical examples demonstrates the robustness and versatility of the proposed
method in applications. For the minimization of the fully discrete energy
functional a variant of the iPALM algorithm is used.

thermodynamics. However, the presence of a physical principle explaining
whether using information is profitable and inevitable remains uncertain. This
paper reports a novel generalization of the second law of thermodynamics,
answering whether such a physical principle exists in the affirmative. The
entropy production can be split into two contributions: the entropy production
of the individual subsystems and the reduction in the correlations between
subsystems. This novel generalization of the second law implies that if an
agent exploits the latter factor, then information is indispensable and
provides free energy or mechanical work outweighing the operational cost. In
particular, the total entropy production has a lower bound corresponding to the
positive quantity that emerges when the internal correlations of the controlled
target diminish, but the correlations between the agent and target do not
exist. Therefore, the information about the target is indispensable for
exploiting the internal correlations to extract free energy or work.
Furthermore, as the internal correlations can grow linearly with the number of
the subsystems constituting the target system, control with such correlations,
i.e., feedback control, can yield substantial gain that exceeds the operational
cost of performing feedback control, which is negligible in the thermodynamic
limit. Thus, the generalized second law presented in this paper can be
interpreted as a physical principle that ensures the benefit and inevitability
of information processing.

paper, we introduce and analyze the symmetric-cone multiplicative update (SCMU)
algorithm for computing cone factorizations when $\mathcal{K}$ is symmetric;
i.e., it is self-dual and homogeneous. Symmetric cones are of central interest
in mathematical optimization as they provide a common language for studying
linear optimization over the nonnegative orthant (linear programs), over the
second-order cone (second order cone programs), and over the cone of positive
semidefinite matrices (semidefinite programs). The SCMU algorithm is
multiplicative in the sense that the iterates are updated by applying a
meticulously chosen automorphism of the cone computed using a generalization of
the geometric mean to symmetric cones. Using an extension of Lieb's concavity
theorem and von Neumann's trace inequality to symmetric cones, we show that the
squared loss objective is non-decreasing along the trajectories of the SCMU

proppant concentrations and fluid rate). We developed a set of methods
including those based on the use of Euclidean distance and clustering
techniques to perform similar (offset) wells search, which is useful for a
field engineer to analyze earlier fracturing treatments on similar wells. These

solved with four different optimization methods: surrogate-based optimization,
sequential least squares programming, particle swarm optimization and
differential evolution. A recommendation system containing all the above

methods that consider only the geometric information of the environment. Those
methods, therefore, cannot recognize paths as traversable when they are covered
by flexible plants. In this paper, we present a novel framework of image-based
scene recognition to realize navigation in such plant-rich environments. Our
recognition model exploits a semantic segmentation branch for general object
classification and a traversability estimation branch for estimating pixel-wise
traversability. The semantic segmentation branch is trained using an
unsupervised domain adaptation method and the traversability estimation branch
is trained with label images generated from the robot's traversal experience
during the data acquisition phase, coined traversability masks. The training
procedure of the entire model is, therefore, free from manual annotation. In
our experiment, we show that the proposed recognition framework is capable of
distinguishing traversable plants more accurately than a conventional semantic
segmentation with traversable plant and non-traversable plant classes, and an
existing image-based traversability estimation method. We also conducted a
real-world experiment and confirmed that the robot with the proposed

solid and smooth. To overcome these undesirable artifacts, we propose the
BezierSeg model which outputs bezier curves encompassing the region of

the segmentation is connected, continuous, and the boundary is smooth. In
addition, it offers sub-pixel accuracy. Without loss of accuracy, the bezier

a doctor can conveniently adjust the curve's control points to refine the
result. Our experiments show that the proposed method runs in real time and

scientific research and engineering practice. Natural porous materials are
ineffective in this frequency range, as well as acoustic resonators which
present too narrow bandwidth of absorption, thus requiring alternative
solutions based on active absorption techniques. In the present work, we
propose an active control framework applied on a closed-box loudspeaker to
enable the adjustment of the acoustic impedance at the loudspeaker diaphragm.
More specifically, based on the proportionality between the pressure inside the
enclosure and the axial displacement of the loudspeaker diaphragm at low
frequencies, we demonstrate both analytically and experimentally that a
PID-like feedback control approach allows tuning independently the compliance,
the resistance and the moving mass of the closed-box loudspeaker to implement a
prescribed impedance of a single-degree-of-freedom resonator. By considering
different control combinations to tailor the resonator characteristics, a
perfect absorption (with absorption coefficient equal to 1) is achievable at
the target resonance frequency, while enlarging the effective absorption
bandwidth. Moreover, the proposed feedback control strategy shows an excellent
control accuracy, especially compared to the feedforward-based control formerly
reported in the literature. The mismatches between the performance of
experimental prototype and the model, likely to result from the control time
delay and the inaccuracy in estimating the loudspeaker parameters, can be
compensated directly by tuning the control parameters in the control platform.
The active resonators implemented through the reported control scheme can be
used to build more complex acoustic devices/structures to enable
high-efficiency broadband sound absorption or other types of acoustic phenomena
such as wavefront shaping.

automatic mood detection algorithms that are often trained on corpora of
predominantly Western popular music? Analyzing 166 participants responses from
Brazil, South Korea, and the US, we examined the similarity between the ratings

with four popular mood detection algorithms. We created a dataset of 360 recent
pop songs drawn from major music charts of the countries and constructed
semantically identical mood descriptors across English, Korean, and Portuguese

familiarity, preference, and perceived moods for a given song. Ratings were
highly similar within and across cultures for basic mood attributes such as
sad, cheerful, and energetic. However, we found significant cross-cultural
differences for more complex characteristics such as dreamy and love. To our
surprise, the results of mood detection algorithms were uniformly correlated
across human ratings from all three countries and did not show a detectable
bias towards any particular culture. Our study thus suggests that the mood
detection algorithms can be considered as an objective measure at least within
the popular music context.

machine learning algorithms is obtaining labeled data for training supervised

sometimes impossible in free-living data collection. As a result, there is a
need to decrease the labeled data required for training. Additionally,
unlabeled data, gathered in-the-wild from existing wearables (such as Bluetooth
earbuds) can be used to train and fine-tune eating-detection models. In this
work, we focus on training a feature extractor for audio signals captured by an
in-ear microphone for the task of eating detection in a self-supervised way. We
base our approach on the SimCLR method for image classification, proposed by
Chen et al. from the domain of computer vision. Results are promising as our

Clumping is a common property of stellar winds and is being
incorporated to a solution of the radiative transfer equation coupled with
kinetic equilibrium equations. However, in static hot model atmospheres,
clumping and its influence on the temperature and density structures have not
been considered and analysed at all to date. This is in spite of the fact that
clumping can influence the interpretation of resulting spectra, as many
inhomogeneities can appear there; for example, as a result of turbulent
motions.
  Aims. We aim to investigate the effects of clumping on atmospheric structure
for the special case of a static, spherically symmetric atmosphere assuming
microclumping and a 1-D geometry.
  Methods. Static, spherically symmetric, non-LTE (local thermodynamic
equilibrium) model atmospheres were calculated using the recent version of our
code, which includes optically thin clumping. The matter is assumed to consist
of dense clumps and a void interclump medium. Clumping is considered by means
of clumping and volume filling factors, assuming all clumps are optically thin.
Enhanced opacity and emissivity in clumps is multiplied by a volume filling
factor to obtain their mean values. These mean values are used in the radiative
transfer equation. Equations of kinetic equilibrium and the thermal balance
equation use clump values of densities. Equations of hydrostatic and radiative
equilibrium use mean values of densities.
  Results. The atmospheric structure was calculated for selected stellar
parameters. Moderate differences were found in temperature structure. However,
clumping causes enhanced continuum radiation for the Lyman-line spectral
region, while radiation in other parts of the spectrum is lower, depending on
the adopted model. The atomic level departure coefficients are influenced by
clumping as well.

machine learning. In several applications, such as community detection, topic
modeling and Gaussian mixture learning, one must estimate a low-rank signal
from a noisy tensor. Hence, understanding the fundamental limits of estimators
of that signal inevitably calls for the study of random tensors. Substantial
progress has been recently achieved on this subject in the large-dimensional
limit. Yet, some of the most significant among these results--in particular, a
precise characterization of the abrupt phase transition (with respect to
signal-to-noise ratio) that governs the performance of the maximum likelihood
(ML) estimator of a symmetric rank-one model with Gaussian noise--were derived
based of mean-field spin glass theory, which is not easily accessible to
non-experts. In this work, we develop a sharply distinct and more elementary
approach, relying on standard but powerful tools brought by years of advances
in random matrix theory. The key idea is to study the spectra of random
matrices arising from contractions of a given random tensor. We show how this
gives access to spectral properties of the random tensor itself. For the
aforementioned rank-one model, our technique yields a hitherto unknown
fixed-point equation whose solution precisely matches the asymptotic
performance of the ML estimator above the phase transition threshold in the
third-order case. A numerical verification provides evidence that the same
holds for orders 4 and 5, leading us to conjecture that, for any order, our
fixed-point equation is equivalent to the known characterization of the ML
estimation performance that had been obtained by relying on spin glasses.
Moreover, our approach sheds light on certain properties of the ML problem
landscape in large dimensions and can be extended to other models, such as
asymmetric and non-Gaussian.

to quantify the prediction reliability, conformal prediction (CP) was developed
with the CPKNN (CP with kNN). However, the conventional CPKNN suffers from high
variance and bias and long computational time as the feature dimensionality
increases. To address these limitations, a new CP framework-conformal
prediction with shrunken centroids (CPSC) is proposed. It regularizes the class
centroids to attenuate the irrelevant features and shrink the sample space for
predictions and reliability quantification. To compare CPKNN and CPSC, we
employed them in the classification of 12 categories of alternative herbal
medicine with electronic nose as a case and assessed them in two tasks: 1)
offline prediction: the training set was fixed and the accuracy on the testing
set was evaluated; 2) online prediction with data augmentation: they filtered
unlabeled data to augment the training data based on the prediction reliability
and the final accuracy of testing set was compared. The result shows that CPSC
significantly outperformed CPKNN in both two tasks: 1) CPSC reached a
significantly higher accuracy with lower computation cost, and with the same
credibility output, CPSC generally achieves a higher accuracy; 2) the data
augmentation process with CPSC robustly manifested a statistically significant
improvement in prediction accuracy with different reliability thresholds, and
the augmented data were more balanced in classes. This novel CPSC provides
higher prediction accuracy and better reliability quantification, which can be
a reliable assistance in decision support.

of the reliability of an AI module's decisions. Classical frequentist learning
methods for the design of AI modules fall short on both counts of adaptation
and monitoring, catering to one-off training and providing overconfident
decisions. This paper proposes a solution to address both challenges by
integrating meta-learning with Bayesian learning. As a specific use case, the
problems of demodulation and equalization over a fading channel based on the
availability of few pilots are studied. Meta-learning processes pilot
information from multiple frames in order to extract useful shared properties
of effective demodulators across frames. The resulting trained demodulators are
demonstrated, via experiments, to offer better calibrated soft decisions, at
the computational cost of running an ensemble of networks at run time. The
capacity to quantify uncertainty in the model parameter space is further
leveraged by extending Bayesian meta-learning to an active setting. In it, the
designer can select in a sequential fashion channel conditions under which to
generate data for meta-learning from a channel simulator. Bayesian active
meta-learning is seen in experiments to significantly reduce the number of

high-order nonlinear terms, representing a challenge for numerical modeling. In
an exact spectral decomposition, high-order nonlinearities correspond to a
convolution that numerically might lead to aliasing instabilities. We present a
study of this problem, in vacuum conditions, based on the $3+1$
Baumgarte-Shibata-Shapiro-Nakamura (BSSN) formalism. We inspect the emergence
of numerical artifacts, in a variety of conditions, by using the
Spectral-FIltered Numerical Gravity codE (\texttt{SFINGE}) - a pseudo-spectral
algorithm, based on a classical (Cartesian) Fourier decomposition. By
monitoring the highest $k-$modes of the dynamical fields, we identify the
culprits of the aliasing and propose procedures that cure such instabilities,
based on the suppression of the aliased wavelengths. This simple algorithm,
together with appropriate treatment of the boundary conditions, can be applied
to a variety of gravitational problems, including those related to massive
objects dynamics.

vehicle - may help to reduce the carbon footprint of human mobility. However,
standard door-to-door ride sharing services trade reduced route length for
increased user travel times and come with the burden of many stops and detours
to pick up individual users. Requiring some users to walk to nearby shared
stops reduces detours, but could become inefficient if spatio-temporal demand
patterns do not well fit the stop locations. Here, we present a simple
computational model of dynamic stop pooling with flexible stop positions, and
analyze its influence on the performance of ride sharing services. We find that
dynamic stop pooling does a-priori not save route length, but occupancy.
Intriguingly, it also reduces the travel time although users walk parts of
their trip. Together, dynamic stop pooling may break the trade-off between
route lengths and travel time in door-to-door ride sharing, thus enabling
higher sustainability and service quality.

in a protoplanetary disk, for which the relative migration switches from
convergent to divergent. This mechanism invokes density waves emitted by one
planet transferring angular momentum to the coorbital region of the other and
then directly to it through the horseshoe drag. We formulate simple analytical
estimates, which indicate when the repulsion mechanism is effective. One
condition for a planet to be repelled is that it forms a partial gap in the
disk and another is that this should contain enough material to support angular
momentum exchange with it. Using two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations we
obtain divergent migration of two super-Earths embedded in a protoplanetary
disk because of repulsion between them and verify these conditions. To
investigate the importance of resonant interaction we study the migration of
planet pairs near first-order commensurabilities. It appears that proximity to
resonance is significant but not essential. In this context we find repulsion
still occurs when the gravitational interaction between the planets is removed
sugesting the importance of angular momentum transfer through waves excited by
another planet. This may occur through the scattering of coorbital material
(the horseshoe drag), or material orbiting close by. Our results indicate that
if conditions favor the repulsion between two planets described above, we
expect to observe planet pairs with their period ratios greater, often only
slightly greater, than resonant values or possibly rarity of commensurability.

problems on parallel computers. A long standing problem with both forms of
adaptivity has been changes in volume of the domain as resolution changes at an
uneven boundary. We propose a solution to exact local conservation and
maintenance of uniform fields while the mesh changes volume as it moves over
orography. This is solved by introducing a volume adjustment parameter which
tracks the true cell volumes without using expensive conservative mapping.
  A finite volume solution of the advection equation over orography on moving

to a Monge-Amp\`{e}re equation which is solved with a Newton solver. The

building height, downward shortwave radiation, and horizontal velocity. We
train the SR model with sets of low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR)
images from building-resolving large-eddy simulations (LESs) in a city, where
the horizontal resolutions of LR and HR are 20 and 5 m, respectively. The
generalization capability of the SR model is confirmed with LESs in another
city. The estimated HR temperature fields are more accurate than those of the
bicubic interpolation and image SR model that takes only the temperature as its
input. Except for the temperature input, the building height is the most
important to reconstruct the HR temperature and enables the SR model to reduce
errors in temperature near building boundaries. The SR model considers the
appropriate boundary for each building from its height information. The
analysis of attention weights indicates that the importance of the building
height increases as the downward shortwave radiation becomes larger. The
contrast between sun and shade is strengthened with the increase in solar
radiation, which may affect the temperature distribution. The short inference
time suggests the potential of the proposed SR model to facilitate a real-time
HR prediction in metropolitan areas by combining it with an LR
building-resolving LES model.

impacted the healthcare sector, increasing the average life expectancy of human
beings. Still, there are gaps that remain unaddressed. There is a lack of
transparency in the healthcare system, which results in inherent trust problems
between patients and hospitals. In the present day, a patient does not know
whether he or she will get the proper treatment from the hospital for the fee
charged. A patient can claim reimbursement of the medical bill from any
insurance company. However, today there is minimal scope for the Insurance
Company to verify the validity of such bills or medical records. A patient can
provide fake details to get financial benefits from the insurance company.
Again, there are trust issues between the patient (i.e., the insurance claimer)
and the insurance company. Blockchain integrated with the smart contract is a
well-known disruptive technology that builds trust by providing transparency to
the system. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-enabled Secure and Smart
HealthCare System. Fairness of all the entities: patient, hospital, or
insurance company involved in the system is guaranteed with no one trusting
each other. Privacy and security of patients' medical data are ensured as well.
We also propose a method for privacy-preserving sharing of aggregated data with
the research community for their own purpose. Shared data must not be
personally identifiable, i.e, no one can link the acquired data to the identity
of any patient or their medical history. We have implemented the prototype in
the Ethereum platform and Ropsten test network, and have included the analysis
as well.

different modalities to outperform their uni-modal counterparts. However, due
to the unavailability of modality-specific sensors or data, multi-modal models

performance of uni-modal affect recognition models by transferring knowledge
from a better-performing (or stronger) modality to a weaker modality during
training. Our proposed multi-modal training framework for cross-modal knowledge
transfer relies on two main steps. First, an encoder-classifier model creates
task-specific representations for the stronger modality. Then, cross-modal
translation generates multi-modal intermediate representations, which are also
aligned in the latent space with the stronger modality representations. To
exploit the contextual information in temporal sequential affect data, we use
Bi-GRU and transformer encoder. We validate our approach on two multi-modal

consistently improves the uni-modal test-time performance of the weaker

which are extremely biased towards the most overdense regions. We see that the
\textsc{Flares} IRX-$\beta$ relation (for $5\le z\le8$) predominantly follows
the local starburst relation. The IRX shows an increase with stellar mass,
plateauing at the high-mass end ($\sim10^{10}$M$_{\odot}$) and shows no
evolution in the median normalisation with redshift. We also look at the
dependence of the peak dust temperature ($T_{\mathrm{peak}}$) on various galaxy
properties including the stellar mass, IR luminosity and sSFR, finding the
correlation to be strongest with sSFR. The luminosity-weighted dust
temperatures increase towards higher redshifts, with the slope of the

The results from \textsc{Flares}, which is able to provide a better statistical

states to map sensory input to an adaptive repertoire of behavior.
Characterizing this mapping is a major challenge for systems biology, and
though experiments that probe internal states are developing rapidly,
organismal complexity presents a fundamental obstacle given the many possible
ways internal states could map to behavior. Using C. elegans as an example, we
propose a protocol for systematic perturbation of neural states that limits
experimental complexity but still characterizes collective aspects of the
neural-behavioral map. We consider experimentally motivated small perturbations
-- ones that are most likely to preserve natural dynamics and are closer to
internal control mechanisms -- to neural states and their impact on collective
neural behavior. Then, we connect such perturbations to the local information
geometry of collective statistics, which can be fully characterized using
pairwise perturbations. Applying the protocol to a minimal model of C. elegans
neural activity, we find that collective neural statistics are most sensitive
to a few principal perturbative modes. Dominant eigenvalues decay initially as
a power law, unveiling a hierarchy that arises from variation in individual
neural activity and pairwise interactions. Highest-ranking modes tend to be
dominated by a few, ""pivotal"" neurons that account for most of the system's
sensitivity, suggesting a sparse mechanism for control of collective behavior.

focused on simulating and comparing the spectral changes caused by solar wind
irradiation and by micrometeoroid bombardment to gain a better understanding of
these individual space weathering processes. We used olivine and pyroxene
pellets as proxies for planetary materials. To simulate solar wind irradiation
we used hydrogen, helium, and argon ions with energies from 5 to 40 keV and
fluences of up to $10^{18}$ particles/cm$^2$. To simulate micrometeoroid
bombardment we used individual femtosecond laser pulses. We analysed the
corresponding evolution of different spectral parameters, which we determined
by applying the Modified Gaussian Model, and we also conducted principal
component analysis. The original mineralogy of the surface influences the
spectral evolution more than the weathering agent, as seen from the diverse
evolution of the spectral slope of olivine and pyroxene upon irradiation. The
spectral slope changes seen in olivine are consistent with observations of
A-type asteroids, while the moderate to no slope changes observed in pyroxene
are consistent with asteroid (4) Vesta. We also observed some differences in
the spectral effects induced by the two weathering agents. Ions simulating
solar wind have a smaller influence on longer wavelengths of the spectra than
laser irradiation simulating micrometeoroid impacts. This is most likely due to
the different penetration depths of ions and laser pulses. Our results suggest
that in some instances it might be possible to distinguish between the
contributions of the two agents on a weathered surface.

utilizing image-level labels. Class activation maps (CAMs) are the commonly
used features to achieve WSOL. However, previous CAM-based methods did not take
full advantage of the shallow features, despite their importance for WSOL.
Because shallow features are easily buried in background noise through
conventional fusion. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective Shallow
feature-aware Pseudo supervised Object Localization (SPOL) model for accurate
WSOL, which makes the utmost of low-level features embedded in shallow layers.
In practice, our SPOL model first generates the CAMs through a novel
element-wise multiplication of shallow and deep feature maps, which filters the
background noise and generates sharper boundaries robustly. Besides, we further
propose a general class-agnostic segmentation model to achieve the accurate
object mask, by only using the initial CAMs as the pseudo label without any
extra annotation. Eventually, a bounding box extractor is applied to the object
mask to locate the target. Experiments verify that our SPOL outperforms the

autoencoder -- consisting of an encoder, channel, and decoder modeled using
neural networks -- has recently been shown to be an effective approach. A
challenge faced in the practical adoption of this learning approach is that
under changing channel conditions (e.g. a wireless link), it requires frequent
retraining of the autoencoder in order to maintain a low decoding error rate.
Since retraining is both time consuming and requires a large number of samples,
it becomes impractical when the channel distribution is changing quickly. We
propose to address this problem using a fast and sample-efficient (few-shot)
domain adaptation method that does not change the encoder and decoder networks.
Different from conventional training-time unsupervised or semi-supervised
domain adaptation, here we have a trained autoencoder from a source
distribution that we want to adapt (at test time) to a target distribution
using only a small labeled dataset, and no unlabeled data. We focus on a
generative channel model based on the Gaussian mixture density network (MDN),
and propose a regularized, parameter-efficient adaptation of the MDN using a
set of affine transformations. The learned affine transformations are then used
to design an optimal transformation at the decoder input to compensate for the
distribution shift, and effectively present to the decoder inputs close to the
source distribution. Experiments on many simulated distribution changes common
to the wireless setting, and a real mmWave FPGA testbed demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method at adaptation using very few target domain samples.

diagnosis. However, even with a powerful deep neural network, there still
exists three big challenges that impede the development of polyp segmentation.
(i) Samples collected under different conditions show inconsistent colors,
causing the feature distribution gap and overfitting issue; (ii) Due to
repeated feature downsampling, small polyps are easily degraded; (iii)
Foreground and background pixels are imbalanced, leading to a biased training.
To address the above issues, we propose the Shallow Attention Network (SANet)
for polyp segmentation. Specifically, to eliminate the effects of color, we
design the color exchange operation to decouple the image contents and colors,
and force the model to focus more on the target shape and structure.
Furthermore, to enhance the segmentation quality of small polyps, we propose
the shallow attention module to filter out the background noise of shallow
features. Thanks to the high resolution of shallow features, small polyps can
be preserved correctly. In addition, to ease the severe pixel imbalance for
small polyps, we propose a probability correction strategy (PCS) during the
inference phase. Note that even though PCS is not involved in the training
phase, it can still work well on a biased model and consistently improve the
segmentation performance. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results on
five challenging benchmarks confirm that our proposed SANet outperforms

entropy of the state created by its level one descendant is non-trivial and is
identical to that of the $U(1)$ current in this theory. We determine the first
sub-leading corrections to the short interval expansion of the entanglement
entropy of descendants in a general CFT from their four point function on the
n-sheeted plane. We show that these corrections are determined by multiplying
squares of appropriate dressing factors to the corresponding corrections of the

proportional to the square of the difference of their dressing factors. We
apply our results to a class of descendants of generalized free fields and

to date. The underlying neuro-motor conditions, often compounded with

data augmentation techniques play a vital role in current disordered speech
recognition systems. In contrast to existing data augmentation techniques only
modifying the speaking rate or overall shape of spectral contour, fine-grained
spectro-temporal differences between disordered and normal speech are modelled
using deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGAN) during data
augmentation to modify normal speech spectra into those closer to disordered
speech. Experiments conducted on the UASpeech corpus suggest the proposed
adversarial data augmentation approach consistently outperformed the baseline
augmentation methods using tempo or speed perturbation on a state-of-the-art
hybrid DNN system. An overall word error rate (WER) reduction up to 3.05\%
(9.7\% relative) was obtained over the baseline system using no data

  Tractability, Algorithms, and Optimization","Journal submission",,,,"cs.DB cs.AI cs.LO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Weakly-Sticky(WS) Datalog+/- is an expressive member of the family of
Datalog+/- program classes that is defined on the basis of the conditions of
stickiness and weak-acyclicity. Conjunctive query answering (QA) over the WS
programs has been investigated, and its tractability in data complexity has
been established. However, the design and implementation of practical QA
algorithms and their optimizations have been open. In order to fill this gap,
we first study Sticky and WS programs from the point of view of the behavior of
the chase procedure. We extend the stickiness property of the chase to that of
generalized stickiness of the chase (GSCh) modulo an oracle that selects (and
provides) the predicate positions where finitely values appear during the
chase. Stickiness modulo a selection function S that provides only a subset of
those positions defines sch(S), a semantic subclass of GSCh. Program classes
with selection functions include Sticky and WS, and another syntactic class
that we introduce and characterize, namely JWS, of jointly-weakly-sticky
programs, which contains WS. The selection functions for these last three
classes are computable, and no external, possibly non-computable oracle is
needed. We propose a bottom-up QA algorithm for programs in the class sch(S),
for a general selection function S. As a particular case, we obtain a
polynomial-time QA algorithm for JWS and weakly-sticky programs. Unlike WS, JWS
turns out to be closed under magic-sets query optimization. As a consequence,
both the generic polynomial-time QA algorithm and its magic-set optimization
can be particularized and applied to WS.

theoretical studies with the aim of interpreting the observational results have
focused on disk models with planets, under the assumption that the disk
substructures are due to the disk-planet interaction. However, so far only in
very few cases exoplanets have been detected in these systems. Furthermore,
some substructures are expected to appear \textit{before} planets form, as they
are necessary to drive the concentration of small solids which can lead to the
formation of planetesimals. In this work we present observational predictions
from high-resolution 3D radiative hydrodynamical models which follow the

in the distribution of millimeter-sized and smaller solid particles produced by
the vertical shear instability. We show that their characteristics are

possibility to form and preserve cumulates and/or flotation crusts by
sedimentation/flotation of crystals. We first use lab-scale analog experiments
to study the stability and the erosion of a floating lid composed of plastics
beads over a convective viscous fluid volumetrically heated by microwave
absorption. We propose an erosion law that depends only on two dimensionless
numbers which govern these phenomena: (i) the Rayleigh-Roberts number,
characterizing the strength of convection and (ii) the Shields number, that
encompasses the physics of the flow-particle interaction. We further consider
the formation of a cumulate at the base of the convective layer due to
sedimentation of beads that are denser than the fluid. We find that particles
deposition occurs at a velocity that scales with the Stokes velocity, a result
consistent with previous experimental studies. The theoretical framework built

for real life settings where active foreground speech can be present. In the
proposed system, each recording is represented by a fixed-length iVector that
models the recording's important properties. A regularized Gaussian backend
classifier with class-specific covariance models is used to extract the
relevant acoustic scene information from these iVectors. To alleviate the large
performance degradation when a foreground speaker dominates the captured
signal, we investigate the use of the iVector framework on Mel-Frequency
Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) that are derived from an estimate of the noise
power spectral density. This noise-floor can be extracted in a statistical
manner for single channel recordings. We show that the use of noise-floor
features is complementary to multi-condition training in which foreground
speech is added to training signal to reduce the mismatch between training and
testing conditions. Experimental results on the DCASE 2016 Task 1 dataset show
that the noise-floor based features and multi-condition training realize
significant classification accuracy gains of up to more than 25 percentage
points (absolute) in the most adverse conditions. These promising results can
further facilitate the integration of ASC in resource-constrained devices such
as hearables.

especially in night vision scenarios. Thus, infrared cameras are often
leveraged to help enhance the visual effects via detecting infrared radiation
in the surrounding environment, but the infrared videos are undesirable due to
the lack of detailed semantic information. In such a case, an effective
video-to-video translation method from the infrared domain to the visible light
counterpart is strongly needed by overcoming the intrinsic huge gap between
infrared and visible fields. To address this challenging problem, we propose an
infrared-to-visible (I2V) video translation method I2V-GAN to generate
fine-grained and spatial-temporal consistent visible light videos by given
unpaired infrared videos. Technically, our model capitalizes on three types of
constraints: 1)adversarial constraint to generate synthetic frames that are
similar to the real ones, 2)cyclic consistency with the introduced perceptual
loss for effective content conversion as well as style preservation, and
3)similarity constraints across and within domains to enhance the content and
motion consistency in both spatial and temporal spaces at a fine-grained level.
Furthermore, the current public available infrared and visible light datasets
are mainly used for object detection or tracking, and some are composed of
discontinuous images which are not suitable for video tasks. Thus, we provide a
new dataset for I2V video translation, which is named IRVI. Specifically, it
has 12 consecutive video clips of vehicle and monitoring scenes, and both
infrared and visible light videos could be apart into 24352 frames.
Comprehensive experiments validate that I2V-GAN is superior to the compared
SOTA methods in the translation of I2V videos with higher fluency and finer
semantic details. The code and IRVI dataset are available at
https://github.com/BIT-DA/I2V-GAN.

  Problems",,,,,"cs.DS cs.CC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The minimum linear ordering problem (MLOP) seeks to minimize an aggregated
cost $f(\cdot)$ due to an ordering $\sigma$ of the items (say $[n]$), i.e.,
$\min_{\sigma} \sum_{i\in [n]} f(E_{i,\sigma})$, where $E_{i,\sigma}$ is the
set of items that are mapped by $\sigma$ to indices at most $i$. This problem
has been studied in the literature for various special cases of the cost
function $f$, and in a general setting for a submodular or supermodular cost
$f$ [ITT2012]. Though MLOP was known to be NP-hard for general submodular
functions, it was unknown whether the special case of graphic matroid MLOP
(with $f$ being the matroid rank function of a graph) was polynomial-time
solvable. Following this motivation, we explore related classes of linear
ordering problems, including symmetric submodular MLOP, minimum latency vertex
cover, and minimum sum vertex cover. We show that the most special cases of our
problem, graphic matroid MLOP and minimum latency vertex cover, are both
NP-hard.
  We further expand the toolkit for approximating MLOP variants: using the
theory of principal partitions, we show a $2-\frac{1+\ell_{f}}{1+|E|}$
approximation to monotone submodular MLOP, where
$\ell_{f}=\frac{f(E)}{\max_{x\in E}f(\{x\})}$ satisfies $1 \leq \ell_f \leq
|E|$. Thus our result improves upon the best known bound of $2-\frac{2}{1+|E|}$
by Iwata, Tetali, and Tripathi [ITT2012]. This leads to a
$2-\frac{1+r(E)}{1+|E|}$ approximation for the matroid MLOP, corresponding to
the case when $r$ is the rank function of a given matroid. Finally, we show
that MLVC can be $4/3$ approximated, matching the integrality gap of its
vanilla LP relaxation.

mass-energy double critical NLS \begin{align} i\partial_t u+\Delta u\pm
|u|^{\frac{4}{d}}u\pm |u|^{\frac{4}{d-2}}u=0\tag{DCNLS} \end{align} in
$H^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$ with $d\geq 3$. In the defocusing-defocusing regime, Tao,
Visan and Zhang show that the unique solution of DCNLS is global and scattering
in time for arbitrary initial data in $H^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$. This does not hold
when at least one of the nonlinearities is focusing, due to the possible
formation of blow-up and soliton solutions. However, precise thresholds for a
solution of DCNLS being scattering were open in all the remaining regimes.
Following the classical concentration compactness principle, we impose sharp
scattering thresholds in terms of ground states for DCNLS in all the remaining
regimes. The new challenge arises from the fact that the remainders of the
standard $L^2$- or $\dot{H}^1$-profile decomposition fail to have
asymptotically vanishing diagonal $L^2$- and $\dot{H}^1$-Strichartz norms
simultaneously. To overcome this difficulty, we construct a double track
profile decomposition which is capable to capture the low, medium and high
frequency bubbles within a single profile decomposition and possesses
remainders that are asymptotically small in both of the diagonal $L^2$- and
$\dot{H}^1$-Strichartz spaces.

performs well on a speaker verification task. Next, probing experiments show
that standardizing the features effectively removes speaker information. Based
on this observation, we propose a speaker normalization step to improve

learning, and formulating new targets for search. To fluidly support such
dynamic search behaviours, we focus on devising interactive visual facets
(IVF), visualising information facets to support user comprehension and control
of the information space. To do this, we reviewed existing faceted search
interfaces and derived two design requirements (DR) that have not been fully
addressed to support fluid interactions in exploratory search. We then
exemplified the requirements through devising an IVF tool, which coordinates a
linear and a categorical facet representing the distribution and summarisation
of items, respectively, and providing context for faceted exploration (DR1). To
support rapid transitions between search criteria (DR2), the tool introduces a
novel design concept of using facets to select items without filtering the item
space. Particularly, we propose a filter-swipe technique that enables users to
drag a categorical facet value sequentially over linear facet bars to view the
items in the intersection of the two facets along with the categorical facet
dynamically summarizing the items in the interaction. Three applications
demonstrate how the features support information discovery with ease. A user
study of 11 participants with realistic email search tasks shows that dynamic
suggestions through the timeline navigation can help discover useful
suggestions for search; the novel design concept was favoured over using facet
values as filters. Based on these practices, we derive IVF design implications
for fluid, exploratory searches.

AVs to broadcast their location periodically and for airports to track and

coverage are urgently needed, addressing anti-spoofing and safe coexistence
concerns. In this work, we propose an ATM solution by exploiting noncoherent
crowdsourced wireless networks (CWNs) and correcting the inherent
clock-synchronization problems present in such non-coordinated sensor networks.
While CWNs can provide a great number of measurements for ubiquitous ATM, these
are normally obtained from unsynchronized sensors. This article first presents
an analysis of the effects of lack of clock synchronization in ATM with CWN and
provides solutions based on the presence of few trustworthy sensors in a large
non-coordinated network. Secondly, autoregressive-based and long short-term
memory (LSTM)-based approaches are investigated to achieve the time
synchronization needed for localization of the AVs. Finally, a combination of a
multilateration (MLAT) method and a Kalman filter is employed to provide an
anti-spoofing tracking solution for AVs. We demonstrate the performance
advantages of our framework through a dataset collected by a real-world CWN.
Our results show that the proposed framework achieves localization accuracy
comparable to that acquired using only GPS-synchronized sensors and outperforms
the localization accuracy obtained based on state-of-the-art CWN

$\Xi^{-}$ hyperons are measured through hadronic decay channels,
$\phi\rightarrow K^+K^-$ and $\Xi^-\rightarrow \Lambda\pi^-$. Collision
centrality and rapidity dependence of the transverse momentum spectra for these
strange hadrons are presented. The $4\pi$ yields and ratios are compared to
thermal model and hadronic transport model predictions. At this collision
energy, thermal model with grand canonical ensemble (GCE) under-predicts the
$\phi/K^-$ and $\phi/\Xi^-$ ratios while the result of canonical ensemble (CE)
calculations reproduce $\phi/K^-$, with the correlation length $r_c \sim
2.7$\,fm, and $\phi/\Xi^-$, $r_c \sim 4.2$\,fm, for the 0-10\% central
collisions. Hadronic transport models including high mass resonance decays
could also describe the ratios. While thermal calculations with GCE work well
for strangeness production in high energy collisions, the change to CE at
$\rm{3\,GeV}$ implies a rather different medium property at high baryon
density.

plants (DVPPs). In particular, we consider a group of heterogeneous distributed
energy resources (DERs) which collectively provide desired dynamic ancillary
services such as fast frequency and voltage control. Our control approach
relies on an adaptive divide-and-conquer strategy: first, we disaggregate the
desired frequency and voltage control specifications of the aggregate DVPP via
adaptive dynamic participation matrices (ADPMs) to obtain the desired local
behavior for each device. Second, we design local linear parameter-varying
(LPV) $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ controllers to optimally match this local behaviors.
In the process, the control design also incorporates the physical and
engineered limits of each DVPP device. Furthermore, our adaptive control design
can properly respond to fluctuating device capacities, and thus include
weather-driven DERs into the DVPP setup. Finally, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our control strategy in a case study based on the IEEE
nine-bus system.

outcomes in Bangladesh. We use nighttime light intensity as a proxy measure of
urbanization and argue that the higher intensity of nighttime light, the higher
is the degree of urbanization, which positively affects child health outcomes.
In econometric estimation, we employ a methodology that combines parametric and
non-parametric approaches using the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), K-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN), and Bootstrap Aggregating that originate from machine learning
algorithms. Based on our benchmark estimates, findings show that one standard

The maximum increase of weight for height and height for age score range from
5.35 to 7.18 units. To further understand our benchmark estimates, generalized
additive models also provide a robust positive relationship between nighttime
light intensity and children's health outcomes. Finally, we develop an economic
model that supports the empirical findings of this study that the marginal

continuous-time quantum walk of photons through waveguide arrays that leverages
on the simple and effective algebraic approach to engineering waveguide

design of basic building blocks of the information and sensing systems:
interconnects, multiport couplers, entanglement generators and interferometers.
An extensive feasibility check in dielectric and semiconductor fabrication

useful to establish the relation between partition functions of conformal
fields on Weyl equivalent spaces. The Euclidean space $S^a\times AdS_b$ can be
mapped to $S^{a+b}$ provided $S^a$ and $AdS_b$ are of the same radius. As an
example, to begin with, we show that the partition function in the character
integral representation of conformally coupled free scalars and fermions are
identical on $S^a\times AdS_b$ and $S^{a+b}$. We then demonstrate that the
partition function of higher derivative conformal scalars and fermions are also
the same on hyperbolic cylinders and branched spheres. The partition function
of the four-derivative conformal vector gauge field on the branched sphere in
$d=6$ dimension can be expressed as an integral over `naive' bulk and `naive'
edge characters. However, the partition function of the conformal vector gauge
field on $S^1_q\times AdS_5$ contains only the `naive' bulk part of the
partition function. This follows the same pattern which was observed for the
partition of conformal $p$-form fields on hyperbolic cylinders. We use the
partition function of higher derivative conformal fields on hyperbolic
cylinders to obtain a linear relationship between the Hofman-Maldacena
variables which enables us to show that these theories are non-unitary.

quantum operations are crucial for the optimization of quantum circuits.
Decision diagrams (DDs), a well-studied data structure originally used to
represent Boolean functions, have proven capable of capturing relevant aspects
of quantum systems, but their limits are not well understood. In this work, we
investigate and bridge the gap between existing DD-based structures and the
stabilizer formalism, an important tool for simulating quantum circuits in the
tractable regime. We first show that although DDs were suggested to succinctly
represent important quantum states, they actually require exponential space for
certain stabilizer states. To remedy this, we introduce a more powerful
decision diagram variant, called Local Invertible Map-DD (LIMDD). We prove that
the set of quantum states represented by poly-sized LIMDDs strictly contains
the union of stabilizer states and other decision diagram variants. Finally,
there exist circuits which LIMDDs can efficiently simulate, but which cannot be
efficiently simulated by two state-of-the-art simulation paradigms: the
Clifford + T simulator and Matrix-Product States. By uniting two successful
approaches, LIMDDs thus pave the way for fundamentally more powerful solutions
for simulation and analysis of quantum computing.

requires carefully selected heating and cooling cycles to fully cure the resin
and form strong crosslinked networks. To fully optimize the processing
parameters for effective epoxy monomer crosslinking and final product
integrity, the evolution of mechanical properties of epoxies during processing
must be comprehensively understood. Because the full experimental
characterization of these properties as a function of the degree of cure is
difficult and time-consuming, efficient computational predictive tools are
needed. The objective of this research is to develop an experimentally
validated Molecular Dynamics (MD) modeling method, which incorporates a
reactive force field, to accurately predict the thermo-mechanical properties of
an epoxy resin as a function of the degree of cure. Experimental rheometric and
mechanical testing are used to validate an MD model which is subsequently used
to predict mass density, shrinkage, elastic properties, and yield strength as a
function of the degree of cure. The results indicate that each of the physical
and mechanical properties evolve uniquely during the crosslinking process.
These results are important for future processing modeling efforts.

precise personalized recommendation of media content. There are two critical
components in the common paradigm of modern recommender models: (1)
representation learning, which generates an embedding for each user and item;
and (2) interaction modeling, which fits user preferences towards items based
on their representations. In spite of great success, when a great amount of
users and items exist, it usually needs to create, store, and optimize a huge
embedding table, where the scale of model parameters easily reach millions or
even larger. Hence, it naturally raises questions about the heavy recommender
models: Do we really need such large-scale parameters? We get inspirations from
the recently proposed lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH), which argues that the
dense and over-parameterized model contains a much smaller and sparser
sub-model that can reach comparable performance to the full model. In this
paper, we extend LTH to media recommender systems, aiming to find the winning
tickets in deep recommender models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to study LTH in media recommender systems. With MF and LightGCN as
the backbone models, we found that there widely exist winning tickets in
recommender models. On three media convergence datasets -- Yelp2018, TikTok and
Kwai, the winning tickets can achieve comparable recommendation performance
with only 29%~48%, 7%~10% and 3%~17% of parameters, respectively.

communication bottleneck in distributed training of large deep neural networks

with $k$ as little as $0.1\%$ of the gradient size, enables training to the
same model quality as the uncompressed case for a similar iteration count. From
the optimization perspective, we find that Top-$k$ is the communication-optimal
sparsifier given a per-iteration $k$ element budget. We argue that to further
the benefits of gradient sparsification, especially for DNNs, a different
perspective is necessary -- one that moves from per-iteration optimality to
consider optimality for the entire training.
  We identify that the total error -- the sum of the compression errors for all
iterations -- encapsulates sparsification throughout training. Then, we propose
a communication complexity model that minimizes the total error under a
communication budget for the entire training. We find that the hard-threshold
sparsifier, a variant of the Top-$k$ sparsifier with $k$ determined by a
constant hard-threshold, is the optimal sparsifier for this model. Motivated by
this, we provide convex and non-convex convergence analyses for the
hard-threshold sparsifier with error-feedback. Unlike with Top-$k$ sparsifier,
we show that hard-threshold has the same asymptotic convergence and linear
speedup property as SGD in the convex case and has no impact on the
data-heterogeneity in the non-convex case. Our diverse experiments on various
DNNs and a logistic regression model demonstrated that the hard-threshold

the PQ symmetry breaking scale, the mechanism can generate PeV-scale heavy
neutrinos as a dark matter candidate. Considering a CP-violating source, during
the phase transition, discriminating between the neutrino and antineutrino

setup can be applied to the first order phase transition with different
strengths. We then calculate effective couplings of the QCD axion addressing
the strong CP problem within the model. We also study the energy density

programs, but they have an undecidable reachability problem. Therefore, there
have been several proposals to underapproximate their sets of runs so that
reachability in this underapproximation becomes decidable. One such
underapproximation that covers a relatively high portion of runs is scope
boundedness. In such a run, after each push to stack $i$, the corresponding pop
operation must come within a bounded number of visits to stack $i$. In this
work, we generalize this approach to a large class of infinite-state systems.
  For this, we consider the model of valence systems, which consist of a
finite-state control and an infinite-state storage mechanism that is specified
by a finite undirected graph. This framework captures pushdowns, vector
addition systems, integer vector addition systems, and combinations thereof.
For this framework, we propose a notion of scope boundedness that coincides
with the classical notion when the storage mechanism happens to be a
multi-pushdown. We show that with this notion, reachability can be decided in
PSPACE for every storage mechanism in the framework. Moreover, we describe the
full complexity landscape of this problem across all storage mechanisms, both

scope bounds.
  Finally, we provide an almost complete description of the complexity

functional forms. However, entanglements reveal themselves as a long tail in
the reciprocal-space correlations, implying a weak but persistent dynamic
localization in real space. Comparison with a number of existing theoretical
models of entangled polymers suggests that they cannot fully describe the
spatial correlations revealed by simulations and experiments. In particular,
the strict one-dimensional diffusion idea of the original tube model is shown
to be flawed. The dynamic spatial correlation analysis demonstrated in this

quantum computation, quantum steering and quantum communication. Therefore, we
focus on engineering the sets that support those resources and on determining
their structures and properties. Such engineering and subsequent implementation
rely on discrimination between statistics of measurement data of quantum states
and those of their classical counterparts. The discriminators considered are
inequalities defined for hypergraphs whose structure and generation are
determined by their basic properties. The generation is inherently random but
with the predetermined quantum probabilities of obtainable data. Two kinds of
statistics of the data are defined for the hypergraphs and six kinds of
inequalities. One kind of statistics, often applied in the literature, turn out
to be inappropriate and two kinds of inequalities turn out not to be
noncontextuality inequalities. Results are obtained by making use of universal
automated algorithms which generate hypergraphs with both odd and even numbers
of hyperedges in any odd and even dimensional space - in this paper, from the
smallest contextual set with just three hyperedges and three vertices to
arbitrarily many contextual sets in up to 8-dimensional spaces. Higher
dimensions are computationally demanding although feasible.

desirable as they allow effective utilization of the source data without
requiring additional annotated training data from the target. Practically,

on pixel-level; (b) training a teacher network on the mapped source and the
unannotated target domain using adversarial feature alignment; and (c) finally
training a student network using the pseudo-labels obtained from the teacher.

the number of mandatory nodes to visit. In this paper, we focus on shortest

reducing biological ankle torques, as well as eight ankle muscle EMGs both

avenues for the systematic adoption of wearable robots as part of

a promising platform to in-situ engineer and optimize novel superconducting
quantum circuits. The key quantity for the circuit design is the
phase-dependent complex admittance of the junction, which can be probed by
sensing an rf SQUID with a tank circuit. Here, we investigate a graphene-based
Josephson junction as a prototype gate-tunable element enclosed in a SQUID loop
that is inductively coupled to a superconducting resonator operating at 3 GHz.
With a concise circuit model that describes the dispersive and dissipative
response of the coupled system, we extract the phase-dependent junction
admittance corrected for self-screening of the SQUID loop. We decompose the
admittance into the current-phase relation and the phase-dependent loss and as
these quantities are dictated by the spectrum and population dynamics of the
supercurrent-carrying Andreev bound states, we gain insight to the underlying
microscopic transport mechanisms in the junction. We theoretically reproduce
the experimental results by considering a short, diffusive junction model that
takes into account the interaction between the Andreev spectrum and the
electromagnetic environment, from which we deduce a lifetime of ~17 ps for
non-equilibrium populations.

the treatment and outcome.
  We use two Neural network architectures and investigate how their

crystals can sediment to form a dense cumulate or may produce a light flotation
crust has been derived in a companion paper. We use this model to study the
thermal history of early accreted planetary bodies accreted during the very
early stages of the formation of the solar system. We study the conditions
required to form and preserve flotation crusts and basal cumulates, and the
implications for the thermal evolution of planetesimals. We calculate the
temperature evolution in an early accreted planetesimals internally heated by
the decay of $\rm{^{26}Al}$ and $\rm{^{60}Fe}$. For planetesimal with radius
$R>30\, \rm{km}$, partial melting reaches 40%, planetesimals undergo a
rheological transition and form a magma ocean, i.e.: a suspension from which
crystals can segregate and form a floating crust and/or a dense cumulate.
Because of the formation of an insulation floating crust, this magma ocean
episode is characterized by a relatively long time life, a slow cooling rate,
and a weak surface heat flux. The model further predicts a cyclic evolution
where episodes of crustal thickening alternate with episodes of melting-induced
crustal thinning. These cycles produce in turn an oscillating thermal history
and prevent runaway thermal heating of the planetesimals. At the end of the
magma ocean episode, when the fraction of crystals becomes larger than 60\%, a
transition occurs to solid-state convection in the planetesimal's mantle. This
stage is characterized by high viscous shear stress that tends to erode
previously formed crystal deposits. However, the time scale of this erosion
process is larger that the lifetime of the planetesimal. Hence solid-state
evolution can be described by a well mixed mantle embedded by a metastable
crust and a preserved cumulate at its base.

domestic venues in a helpful, discreet way. Here, we use a speculative approach
to shine light on a new concept of robot steganography (RS), that a robot could
seek to help vulnerable populations by discreetly warning of potential threats.
We first identify some potentially useful scenarios for RS related to safety
and security -- concerns that are estimated to cost the world trillions of
dollars each year -- with a focus on two kinds of robots, an autonomous vehicle
(AV) and a socially assistive humanoid robot (SAR). Next, we propose that
existing, powerful, computer-based steganography (CS) approaches can be adopted
with little effort in new contexts (SARs), while also pointing out potential
benefits of human-like steganography (HS): although less efficient and robust
than CS, HS represents a currently-unused form of RS that could also be used to
avoid requiring computers or detection by more technically advanced
adversaries. This analysis also introduces some unique challenges of RS that
arise from message generation, indirect perception, and effects of perspective.
For this, we explore some related theoretical and practical concerns for
selecting carrier signals and generating messages, also making available some
code and a video demo. Finally, we report on checking the current feasibility
of the RS concept via a simplified user study, confirming that messages can be
hidden in a robot's behaviors. The immediate implication is that RS could help
to improve people's lives and mitigate some costly problems -- suggesting the
usefulness of further discussion, ideation, and consideration by designers.

of the generated data has become a topic of interest in the context of deep
generative models of music. Recent attempts in this direction have relied on
learning disentangled representations from data such that the underlying
factors of variation are well separated. In this paper, we focus on the
relationship between disentanglement and controllability by conducting a
systematic study using different supervised disentanglement learning algorithms
based on the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) architecture. Our experiments show
that a high degree of disentanglement can be achieved by using different forms
of supervision to train a strong discriminative encoder. However, in the
absence of a strong generative decoder, disentanglement does not necessarily
imply controllability. The structure of the latent space with respect to the
VAE-decoder plays an important role in boosting the ability of a generative
model to manipulate different attributes. To this end, we also propose methods
and metrics to help evaluate the quality of a latent space with respect to the
afforded degree of controllability.

at larger frequencies, where the dynamics can be described by the time-averaged

connected and autonomous vehicle charging infrastructure (CAV-CI) is studied.
In the considered CAV-CI, the distribution system operator (DSO) deploys
electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) to provide an EV charging facility for
human-driven connected vehicles (CVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs). The
charging request by the human-driven EV becomes irrational when it demands more
energy and charging period than its actual need. Therefore, the scheduling
policy of each EVSE must be adaptively accumulated the irrational charging
request to satisfy the charging demand of both CVs and AVs. To tackle this, we
formulate an RDSS problem for the DSO, where the objective is to maximize the
charging capacity utilization by satisfying the laxity risk of the DSO. Thus,
we devise a rational reward maximization problem to adapt the irrational
behavior by CVs in a data-informed manner. We propose a novel risk adversarial
multi-agent learning system (RAMALS) for CAV-CI to solve the formulated RDSS
problem. In RAMALS, the DSO acts as a centralized risk adversarial agent (RAA)
for informing the laxity risk to each EVSE. Subsequently, each EVSE plays the
role of a self-learner agent to adaptively schedule its own EV sessions by
coping advice from RAA. Experiment results show that the proposed RAMALS
affords around 46.6% improvement in charging rate, about 28.6% improvement in
the EVSE's active charging time and at least 33.3% more energy utilization, as
compared to a currently deployed ACN EVSE system, and other baselines.

lateral resolution away from the focal plane, and use sub-pixel cross

this approach on data from a commercial spectral domain optical coherence

overcome this issue, we proposed a novel approach called complementary Fourier
single-pixel imaging (CFSI) to reduce measurements while retaining its

micromirror device. CFSI only requires two phase-shifted patterns to obtain one
Fourier spectral value. Four light intensity values are obtained by load the
two patterns, and the spectral value is calculated through differential
measurement, which has good robustness to noise. The proposed method is
verified by simulations and experiments compared with FSI based on two-,
three-, and four-step phase shift algorithms. CFSI performed better than the
other methods under the condition that the best imaging quality of CFSI is not

to overcome this disadvantage. Retina-like patterns, as one of the compressive
sensing approaches, enhance the imaging quality of region of interest (ROI)
while not increase measurements. The design of the retina-like patterns
determines the performance of the ROI in the reconstructed image. Unlike the
conventional method to fill in ROI with random patterns, we propose to optimize
retina-like patterns by filling in the ROI with the patterns containing the
sparsity prior of objects. This proposed method is verified by simulations and
experiments compared with conventional GI, retina-like GI and GI using patterns
optimized by principal component analysis. The method using optimized
retina-like patterns obtain the best imaging quality in ROI than other methods.
Meanwhile, the good generalization ability of the optimized retina-like pattern
is also verified. While designing the size and position of the ROI of
retina-like pattern, the feature information of the target can be obtained to
optimize the pattern of ROI. This proposed method paves the way for realizing

$\mathcal{S}$ whose time evolution is deduced adopting an operatorial approach,

mechanics, $H$ denotes the Hamiltonian for $\mathcal{S}$, while $\rho$ is a
certain rule applied periodically on $\mathcal{S}$. In this approach the rule
acts at specific times $k\tau$, with $k$ integer and $\tau$ fixed, by modifying
some of the parameters entering $H$ according to the state variation of the

be obtained. Here, we consider the limit for $\tau\rightarrow 0$, so that we
introduce a generalized model leading to asymptotic equilibria. Moreover, in

interplay between large-width asymptotic properties of deep Gaussian neural

stochastic processes (SPs). Such an interplay has proved to be critical in
Bayesian inference under Gaussian SP priors, kernel regression for infinitely
wide deep NNs trained via gradient descent, and information propagation within
infinitely wide NNs. Motivated by empirical analyses that show the potential of
replacing Gaussian distributions with Stable distributions for the NN's
weights, in this paper we present a rigorous analysis of the large-width
asymptotic behaviour of (fully connected) feed-forward deep Stable NNs, i.e.
deep NNs with Stable-distributed weights. We show that as the width goes to
infinity jointly over the NN's layers, i.e. the ``joint growth"" setting, a
rescaled deep Stable NN converges weakly to a Stable SP whose distribution is
characterized recursively through the NN's layers. Because of the
non-triangular structure of the NN, this is a non-standard asymptotic problem,
to which we propose an inductive approach of independent interest. Then, we
establish sup-norm convergence rates of the rescaled deep Stable NN to the
Stable SP, under the ``joint growth"" and a ``sequential growth"" of the width
over the NN's layers. Such a result provides the difference between the ``joint
growth"" and the ``sequential growth"" settings, showing that the former leads to
a slower rate than the latter, depending on the depth of the layer and the
number of inputs of the NN. Our work extends some recent results on infinitely
wide limits for deep Gaussian NNs to the more general deep Stable NNs,
providing the first result on convergence rates in the ``joint growth"" setting.

classical machine learning algorithms to detect stress using hand-crafted

novel hybrid CNN (H-CNN) classifier that uses both the hand-crafted features

We demonstrate the effectiveness of these two tools in suppressing extreme

potential. As far as the constant bias is concerned, in the Li\'enard system,
the suppression occurs due to the decrease in large amplitude oscillations and
in the non-polynomial mechanical system the suppression occurs due to the
destruction of chaos into a periodic orbit. As far as the second periodic
forcing is concerned, in both the examples, extreme events get suppressed due
to the increase in large amplitude oscillations. We also demonstrate that by
introducing a phase in the second periodic forcing one can decrease the
probability of occurrence of extreme events even further in the non-polynomial
system. To provide a support to the complete suppression of extreme events, we
present the two parameter probability plot for all the cases. In addition to
the above, we examine the feasibility of the aforementioned tools in a
parametrically driven version of the non-polynomial mechanical system. Finally,
