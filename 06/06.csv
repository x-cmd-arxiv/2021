structure is often unknown. Thus, we may identify the most influential seed
nodes by exploring only a part of the underlying network given a small budget
for node queries. Motivated by the fact that collecting node metadata is more
cost-effective than investigating the relationship between nodes via queried
nodes, we propose IM-META, an end-to-end solution to IM in networks with
unknown topology by retrieving information from queries and node metadata.
However, using such metadata to aid the IM process is not without risk due to
the noisy nature of metadata and uncertainties in connectivity inference. To
tackle these challenges, we formulate a new IM problem that aims to find both
seed nodes and queried nodes. In IM-META, we develop an effective method that
iteratively performs three steps: 1) we learn the relationship between
collected metadata and edges via a Siamese neural network model, 2) we select a
number of inferred confident edges to construct a reinforced graph, and 3) we
identify the next node to query by maximizing the inferred influence spread
using our topology-aware ranking strategy. By querying only 5% of nodes,
IM-META reaches 93% of the upper bound performance.

simplices. Therefore the topological wave function satisfies a relaxed
condition of locality as it acquires the same value along simplices of

whose dispersion relation is determined by the spectral properties of the Dirac

the Dirac equation leads to multiple energy bands. On multiplex networks the

valuation for ensembles, become increasingly more important in many machine
learning applications. Such problems are commonly solved by well-known
game-theoretic criteria, such as Shapley value or Banzhaf value. In this work,
we present a novel energy-based treatment for cooperative games, with a
theoretical justification by the maximum entropy framework. Surprisingly, by
conducting variational inference of the energy-based model, we recover various
game-theoretic valuation criteria through conducting one-step fixed point
iteration for maximizing the mean-field ELBO objective. This observation also
verifies the rationality of existing criteria, as they are all attempting to
decouple the correlations among the players through the mean-field approach. By
running fixed point iteration for multiple steps, we achieve a trajectory of
the valuations, among which we define the valuation with the best conceivable
decoupling error as the Variational Index. We prove that under uniform
initializations, these variational valuations all satisfy a set of
game-theoretic axioms. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed
Variational Index enjoys lower decoupling error and better valuation
performance on certain synthetic and real-world valuation problems.

sequentially on a set of tasks while seeking to retain performance on all
previous tasks. A key challenge in CL is catastrophic forgetting, which arises
when performance on a previously mastered task is reduced when learning a new
task. While a variety of methods exist to combat forgetting, in some cases
tasks are fundamentally incompatible with each other and thus cannot be learnt
by a single policy. This can occur, in reinforcement learning (RL) when an
agent may be rewarded for achieving different goals from the same observation.
In this paper we formalize this ""interference"" as distinct from the problem of
forgetting. We show that existing CL methods based on single neural network
predictors with shared replay buffers fail in the presence of interference.
Instead, we propose a simple method, OWL, to address this challenge. OWL learns
a factorized policy, using shared feature extraction layers, but separate
heads, each specializing on a new task. The separate heads in OWL are used to
prevent interference. At test time, we formulate policy selection as a
multi-armed bandit problem, and show it is possible to select the best policy
for an unknown task using feedback from the environment. The use of bandit
algorithms allows the OWL agent to constructively re-use different continually
learnt policies at different times during an episode. We show in multiple RL
environments that existing replay based CL methods fail, while OWL is able to
achieve close to optimal performance when training sequentially.

The present work mainly focuses on exploring the possibility of applying a
Langevin type of random torque model to predict the rotational dynamics of the
particle phase. Towards this objective, direct numerical simulations (DNS) have
been carried out for particle laden turbulent shear flow with Reynolds number,
$Re_\delta=750$ in presence of sub-Kolmogorov sized inertial particles (Stokes
number >>1). The inter-particle and wall-particle interactions have also been
considered to be elastic. From the particle equation of rotational motion, we
arrive at the expression where the fluctuating angular acceleration fluctuation
$\alpha'_i$ of the particle is expressed as the ratio of a linear combination
of fluctuating rotational velocities of particle $\omega'_i$ and fluid angular
velocity $\Omega'_i$ to the particle rotational relaxation time $\tau_r$. The
analysis was done using p.d.f plots and Jensen-Shannon Divergence based method
to assess the similarity of the particle net rotational acceleration
distribution $f(\alpha'_i)$, with (i) the distributions of particle
acceleration component arising from fluctuating fluid angular velocity computed
in the particle-Largrangian frame $f(\Omega'_i/\tau_r)_{pl}$, (ii) fluctuating
particle angular velocity $f(\omega'_i/\tau_r)_{pl}$, and (iii) the fluid
angular velocity $(\Omega'_i/\tau_r)_{e}$, computed in the fluid Eulerian
grids. The analysis leads to the conclusion that $f(\alpha'_i)$ can be modeled
with a Gaussian white noise using a pre-estimated strength which can be
calculated from the temporal correlation of $(\Omega'_i/\tau_r)_{e}$.

densities, passivating mid-gap states and surfaces, and improving
photoconductivity in silicon-based electro-optical devices. Modelling the
atomic scale structure of this material is critical to understanding these
processes, which in turn is needed to describe c-Si/a-Si:H heterjunctions that
are at the heart of the modern solar cells with world record efficiency.
Density functional theory (DFT) studies achieve the required high accuracy but
are limited to moderate system sizes a hundred atoms or so by their high
computational cost. Simulations of amorphous materials in particular have been
hindered by this high cost because large structural models are required to
capture the medium range order that is characteristic of such materials.
Empirical potential models are much faster, but their accuracy is not
sufficient to correctly describe the frustrated local structure. Data driven,
""machine learned"" interatomic potentials have broken this impasse, and have
been highly successful in describing a variety of amorphous materials in their
elemental phase. Here we extend the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) for
silicon by incorporating the interaction with hydrogen, thereby significantly
improving the degree of realism with which amorphous silicon can be modelled.
We show that our Si:H GAP enables the simulation of hydrogenated silicon with
an accuracy very close to DFT, but with computational expense and run times
reduced by several orders of magnitude for large structures. We demonstrate the
capabilities of the Si:H GAP by creating models of hydrogenated liquid and
amorphous silicon, and showing that their energies, forces and stresses are in

  naturalistic experiments",,,,,"q-bio.NC cs.AI cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Multi-regional interaction among neuronal populations underlies the brain's
processing of rich sensory information in our daily lives. Recent neuroscience
and neuroimaging studies have increasingly used naturalistic stimuli and
experimental design to identify such realistic sensory computation in the
brain. However, existing methods for cross-areal interaction analysis with
dimensionality reduction, such as reduced-rank regression and canonical
correlation analysis, have limited applicability and interpretability in
naturalistic settings because they usually do not appropriately 'demix' neural
interactions into those associated with different types of task parameters or
stimulus features (e.g., visual or audio). In this paper, we develop a new
method for cross-areal interaction analysis that uses the rich task or stimulus
parameters to reveal how and what types of information are shared by different
neural populations. The proposed neural demixed shared component analysis
combines existing dimensionality reduction methods with a practical neural
network implementation of functional analysis of variance with latent
variables, thereby efficiently demixing nonlinear effects of continuous and
multimodal stimuli. We also propose a simplifying alternative under the
assumptions of linear effects and unimodal stimuli. To demonstrate our methods,
we analyzed two human neuroimaging datasets of participants watching
naturalistic videos of movies and dance movements. The results demonstrate that
our methods provide new insights into multi-regional interaction in the brain
during naturalistic sensory inputs, which cannot be captured by conventional
techniques.

previous works we derive an effective approximate Hamiltonian for the
two-impurity SBM that preserves the excitation-number and thus facilitates the
analytical treatment. In particular, it allows us to introduce non-Markovianity
arising from delay-feedback effects in two distant emitters in the so-called
ultrastrong coupling (USC) regime. We test our results with numerical
simulations performed over a discretized circuit-QED model, finding perfect
agreement with previous results, and showing interesting dynamical effects
arising in ultrastrong waveguide QED with distant emitters. In particular, we
revisit the Fermi two-atom problem showing that, in the USC regime, initial
correlations yield two different evolutions for symmetric and antisymmetric
states even before the emitters become causally connected. Finally, we
demonstrate that the collective dynamics, e.g., superradiance or subradiance,
are affected not only by the distance between emitters, but also by the
coupling, due to significant frequency renormalization. This constitutes
another dynamical consequence of the USC regime.

classical Hamiltonian action of $K$ with $\mathfrak{k}^*$-valued moment map to
a Hamiltonian action with an $AN$-valued moment map, via a deformation of
symplectic structures. We obtain our main result by proving a ``delinearization
commutes with symplectic quotients'' theorem which is also of independent
interest, and then putting this together with the local normal form theorem for
classical Hamiltonian actions wtih $\mathfrak{k}^*$-valued moment maps. A key
ingredient for our main result is the delinearization
$\mathcal{D}(\omega_{can})$ of the canonical symplectic structure on $T^*K$, so
we additionally take some steps toward explicit computations of
$\mathcal{D}(\omega_{can})$. In particular, in the case $K=SU(2)$, we obtain
explicit formulas for the matrix coefficients of $\mathcal{D}(\omega_{can})$

the genuinely quantum solutions, which are the solutions of size $N^2$ that

operators for compressing the local Hessians, such as Top-$K$ or Rank-$R$,
which are vastly superior in practice. Notably, we do not need to rely on error
feedback for our methods to work with contractive compressors. Moreover, we
develop FedNL-PP, FedNL-CR and FedNL-LS, which are variants of FedNL that
support partial participation, and globalization via cubic regularization and
line search, respectively, and FedNL-BC, which is a variant that can further
benefit from bidirectional compression of gradients and models, i.e., smart
uplink gradient and smart downlink model compression. We prove local
convergence rates that are independent of the condition number, the number of

focusing in particular on the (inequality in) individual miners' efficiencies.
Prior work attributed differences in miners' efficiencies mostly to attacks,
but we pursue a different question: Can inequality in miners' efficiencies be
explained by delays, even when all miners are honest? Traditionally, such
efficiency-related questions were tackled only at the level of the overall
system, and in a peer-to-peer (P2P) setting where miners directly connect to
one another. Despite it being common today for miners to pool compute
capacities in a mining pool managed by a centralized coordinator, efficiency in
such a coordinated setting has barely been studied.
  In this paper, we propose a simple model of a proof-of-work blockchain with
latencies for both the P2P and the coordinated settings. We derive a
closed-form expression for the efficiency in the coordinated setting with an
arbitrary number of miners and arbitrary latencies, both for the overall system
and for each individual miner. We leverage this result to show that
inequalities arise from variability in the delays, but that if all miners are
equidistant from the coordinator, they have equal efficiency irrespective of
their compute capacities. We then prove that, under a natural consistency
condition, the overall system efficiency in the P2P setting is higher than that
in the coordinated setting. Finally, we perform a simulation-based study to
demonstrate that even in the P2P setting delays between miners introduce
inequalities, and that there is a more complex interplay between delays and
compute capacities.

major security concern. Adding security features to CAN is difficult due to the
limited resources available to the individual ECUs and the costs that would be
associated with adding the necessary hardware to support any additional
security operations without overly degrading the performance of standard

many of the same problems. The lack of security becomes even more concerning as
vehicles continue to adopt smart features. Smart vehicles have a multitude of

physically unclonable functions (PUFs) and lightweight cryptography (LWC). The

also minimizing the amount of additional message overhead required for its
operation. The improvements in our proposed framework results in major
reduction in the number of CAN frames that must be sent during operation. For a

hyper-parameters. As an example, in most optimal stochastic contextual bandit
algorithms, there is an unknown exploration parameter which controls the
trade-off between exploration and exploitation. A proper choice of the
hyper-parameters is essential for contextual bandit algorithms to perform well.
However, it is infeasible to use offline tuning methods to select
hyper-parameters in contextual bandit environment since there is no
pre-collected dataset and the decisions have to be made in real time. To tackle
this problem, we first propose a two-layer bandit structure for auto tuning the

systems, analyzing driver behavior during overtaking. A total of 500 overtaking
movements were registered with 50 motorcycles set up with a high-resolution
camera and GPS system implemented by 50 professional bikers in India in an
undivided one-way road. A technique was developed to collect data explaining
the actions of the motorcyclists, based on video and GPS analyses. The overall
overtaking period was designed using a risk-based model, which indicates the
span of the overtaking based on several coefficients. The proposed model is
useful to analyze the behavior during overtaking moves, as well as to develop
road and vehicle safety systems to reduce the chances of accidents.

nonconvex stochastic optimization and particularly for the training of deep
neural networks. In standard SGD, parameters are updated by improving along the
path of the gradient at the current iterate on a batch of examples, where the
addition of a ``momentum'' term biases the update in the direction of the
previous change in parameters. In non-stochastic convex optimization one can
show that a momentum adjustment provably reduces convergence time in many
settings, yet such results have been elusive in the stochastic and non-convex
settings. At the same time, a widely-observed empirical phenomenon is that in
training deep networks stochastic momentum appears to significantly improve
convergence time, variants of it have flourished in the development of other
popular update methods, e.g. ADAM [KB15], AMSGrad [RKK18], etc. Yet theoretical
justification for the use of stochastic momentum has remained a significant
open question. In this paper we propose an answer: stochastic momentum improves
deep network training because it modifies SGD to escape saddle points faster
and, consequently, to more quickly find a second order stationary point. Our
theoretical results also shed light on the related question of how to choose
the ideal momentum parameter--our analysis suggests that $\beta \in [0,1)$
should be large (close to 1), which comports with empirical findings. We also
provide experimental findings that further validate these conclusions.

scientific productivity, it has not yet been well understood how the

be, i.e., how the knowledge value of papers and knowledge amount vary with
development of the discipline. This raises the question of whether high
scientific productivity equals large knowledge amount. Here, building on rich
literature on academic conferences and journals, we collect 185 million
articles covering 19 disciplines published during 1970 to 2020, and establish
citation network research area to represent the knowledge flow from the authors
of the article being cited to the authors of the articles that cite it under
each specific area. As a result, the structure formed during the evolution of
each scientific area can implicitly tells how the knowledge flows between nodes

leveraging Structural entropy in structured high-dimensional space and Shannon
entropy in unstructured probability space, we propose the Quantitative Index of
Knowledge (KQI), which is taken as the subtraction between the two types of
entropy, to reflect the extent of disorder difference (knowledge amount) caused

explicitly tackle this challenge, via a principled framework called
Self-Damaging Contrastive Learning (SDCLR), to automatically balance the

drawn from the recent finding that deep models have difficult-to-memorize
samples, and those may be exposed through network pruning. It is further
natural to hypothesize that long-tail samples are also tougher for the model to
learn well due to insufficient examples. Hence, the key innovation in SDCLR is
to create a dynamic self-competitor model to contrast with the target model,
which is a pruned version of the latter. During training, contrasting the two
models will lead to adaptive online mining of the most easily forgotten samples
for the current target model, and implicitly emphasize them more in the
contrastive loss. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and imbalance
settings show that SDCLR significantly improves not only overall accuracies but
also balancedness, in terms of linear evaluation on the full-shot and few-shot

fields near an electrical conductor. A non-Hermitian pseudo-gap can host
symmetry-protected mid-gap modes like ordinary topological gaps, but the
mid-gap modes are extended instead of edge-localized, and exhibit extreme
sensitivity to symmetry-breaking perturbations. Surprisingly, pseudo-gaps can
also host an integer number of edge modes even though the pseudo-bands possess
fractional topological windings, or even no well-defined Chern number at all,

the slot number and measuring the signal level. The number of signal slots is
constant per one symbol when we use Pulse Position Modulation (PPM). If the
number of received signal slots per one symbol time is less than the
theoretical value, that means the threshold value is higher than the optimal

is not equal to the signal level because there is a ratio between the number of

gravitational potential of a galaxy cluster can be modelled dynamically with
different types of tracers. In order to segregate different systematics and the
effects of varying estimator performances, we first focus on applying a generic
minimal assumption method (oPDF) to model the simulated haloes using the full
6-D phasespace information. We show that the halo mass and concentration can be
recovered in an ensemble unbiased way, with a stochastic bias that varies from
halo to halo, mostly reflecting deviations from steady state in the tracer
distribution. The typical systematic uncertainty is $\sim 0.17$ dex in the
virial mass and $\sim 0.17$ dex in the concentration as well when dark matter
particles are used as tracers. The dynamical state of satellite galaxies are
close to that of dark matter particles, while intracluster stars are less in a
steady state, resulting in a $\sim$ 0.26 dex systematic uncertainty in mass.
Compared with galactic haloes hosting Milky-Way-like galaxies, cluster haloes
show a larger stochastic bias in the recovered mass profiles. We also test the
accuracy of using intracluster gas as a dynamical tracer modelled through a
generalised hydrostatic equilibrium equation, and find a comparable systematic
uncertainty in the estimated mass to that using dark matter. Lastly, we
demonstrate that our conclusions are largely applicable to other steady-state
dynamical models including the spherical Jeans equation, by quantitatively
segregating their statistical efficiencies and robustness to systematics. We
also estimate the limiting number of tracers that leads to the
systematics-dominated regime in each case.

the HAMS proposal satisfies a class of stochastic differential equations

for HAMS under the univariate Gaussian setting, including the stationary
variance, the expected acceptance rate, and the spectral radius. From these
results, we derive default choices of tuning parameters for HAMS, such that
only the step size needs to be tuned in applications. Various relatively recent

year-long experiment on 41 healthy older adults (26 females and 15 males) in
the age range 60-80 with mean age 73.36+-5.25 during a Trier Social Stress Test
(TSST) protocol. The anxiety level ground truth was obtained from State-Trait
Anxiety Inventory (STAI), which is regarded as the gold standard to measure
perceived anxiety. EDA and Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) signals were recorded using
a wrist-worn EDA and PPG sensor respectively. 47 features were computed from
EDA and BVP signal, out of which a final set of 24 significantly correlated
features were selected for analysis. The phases of the experimental study are
encoded as unique integers to generate the context feature vector. A
combination of features from a single sensor with the context feature vector is
used for training a machine learning model to distinguish between anxious and
not-anxious states. Results and analysis showed that the EDA and BVP machine
learning models that combined the context feature along with the physiological
features achieved 3.37% and 6.41% higher accuracy respectively than the models
that used only physiological features. Further, end-to-end processing of EDA

demonstrates the practicality of the proposed anxiety detection method in
facilitating long-term monitoring of anxiety in older adults using low-cost

part, on the use of context trees, and it includes a collection of effective
algorithmic tools for learning and inference. A discrete context (or 'state')
is extracted for each sample, consisting of a discretised version of some of
the most recent observations preceding it. The set of all relevant contexts are
represented as a discrete context-tree. At the bottom level, a different
real-valued time series model is associated with each context-state, i.e., with
each leaf of the tree. This defines a very general framework that can be used
in conjunction with any existing model class to build flexible and

treatment variable on an outcome. However, practitioners may also be interested
in the effect of simultaneous interventions on multiple covariates of a fixed

of joint interventions using data from different experiments in which only very
few variables are manipulated. If there is only little randomized data or no
randomized data at all, one can use observational data sets if certain parental
sets are known or instrumental variables are available. If the joint causal
effect is linear, the proposed method can be used for estimation and inference
of joint causal effects, and we characterize conditions for identifiability. In
the overidentified case, we indicate how to leverage all the available causal
information across multiple data sets to efficiently estimate the causal
effects. If the dimension of the covariate vector is large, we may only have a
few samples in each data set. Under a sparsity assumption, we derive an
estimator of the causal effects in this high-dimensional scenario. In addition,
we show how to deal with the case where a lack of experimental constraints
prevents direct estimation of the causal effects. When the joint causal effects
are non-linear, we characterize conditions under which identifiability holds,
and propose a non-linear causal aggregation methodology for experimental data
sets similar to the gradient boosting algorithm where in each iteration we
combine weak learners trained on different datasets using only unconfounded
samples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on simulated

algorithms achieve linear speedup over the batch size even for non-smooth and
non-convex (particularly, weakly convex) problems. To this end, we develop a
novel sensitivity analysis of the proximal mapping involved in each algorithm
iteration. Our analysis appears to be of independent interests in more general

descent, we propose a new stochastic extrapolated model-based method, greatly
extending the classic Polyak momentum technique to a wider class of stochastic
algorithms for weakly convex optimization. The rate of convergence to some
natural stationarity condition is established over a fairly flexible range of
extrapolation terms.
  While mainly focusing on weakly convex optimization, we also extend our work
to convex optimization. We apply the minibatch and extrapolated model-based
methods to stochastic convex optimization, for which we provide a new
complexity bound and promising linear speedup in batch size. Moreover, an
accelerated model-based method based on Nesterov's momentum is presented, for

derivation of the software architecture from the source code is a challenging
task. Further, such an architecture consists of multiple layers, and
distributing the existing elements into these layers should be done accurately

of layered architectures from Java-based software systems using the concept of
ego networks. Ego networks have traditionally been used for social network
analysis, but in this paper, they are modified in a particular way and tuned to
suit the mentioned task. Specifically, a dependency network is extracted from

create and optimize ego layers in a particular structure. These ego layers when
integrated and optimized together give the final layered architecture. The
proposed approach is evaluated in two ways: on static versions of three

distribution of nodes amongst the proposed layers and the committed violations
are observed on both class level and package level. The proposed method is seen
to outperform the existing standard approaches over multiple performance

we adopt a multi-scale network with a weighted smoothness loss to handle the

novel 3D convolutional network, called two-stage-age-network (TSAN), is
proposed to estimate brain age from T1-weighted MRI data. Compared with
existing methods, TSAN has the following improvements. First, TSAN uses a
two-stage cascade network architecture, where the first-stage network estimates
a rough brain age, then the second-stage network estimates the brain age more
accurately from the discretized brain age by the first-stage network. Second,
to our knowledge, TSAN is the first work to apply novel ranking losses in brain
age estimation, together with the traditional mean square error (MSE) loss.
Third, densely connected paths are used to combine feature maps with different
scales. The experiments with $6586$ MRIs showed that TSAN could provide
accurate brain age estimation, yielding mean absolute error (MAE) of $2.428$
and Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of $0.985$, between the estimated
and chronological ages. Furthermore, using the brain age gap between brain age
and chronological age as a biomarker, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Mild
Cognitive Impairment (MCI) can be distinguished from healthy control (HC)
subjects by support vector machine (SVM). Classification AUC in AD/HC and
MCI/HC was $0.904$ and $0.823$, respectively. It showed that brain age gap is
an effective biomarker associated with risk of dementia, and has potential for

plastic responses results in {\em screened elasticity} in which strains and
stresses can either quantitatively or qualitatively differ from the un-screened
theory, depending on the specific screening mechanism. Here we offer a theory
of such screening effects by plastic quadrupoles, dipoles and monopoles,
explain their natural appearance, and point out the analogy to electrostatic
screening by electric charges and dipoles. For low density of quadrupoles the
effect is to normalize the elastic moduli without a qualitative change compared
to pure elasticity theory; for higher density of quadrupoles the screening
effects result in qualitative changes. Predictions for the spatial dependence

Gaussian system in the presence of integrity attacks. The attacker can
compromise $p$ out of $m$ sensors, the set of which is fixed over time and
unknown to the system operator, and manipulate the measurements arbitrarily.
Under the assumption that all the unstable eigenvalues of system matrix $A$
have geometric multiplicity 1 (unstable part of $A$ is non-derogatory), we
propose a secure estimation scheme that is resilient to integrity attack as
long as the system is $2p$-sparse detectable, which is proved to be the
fundamental limit of secure dynamic estimation. In the absence of attack, the
proposed estimation coincides with Kalman estimation with a certain probability
that can be adjusted to trade-off between performance with and without attack.
Furthermore, the detectability condition checking in the designing phase and
the estimation computing in the online operating phase are both computationally
efficient. A numerical example is provided to corroborate the results and
illustrate the performance of the proposed estimator.

relations, we construct graphs to model human skeletons from different levels,
and for the first time propose a Multi-level Graph encoding approach with
Structural-Collaborative Relation learning (MG-SCR) to encode discriminative
graph features for person Re-ID. Specifically, considering that
structurally-connected body components are highly correlated in a skeleton, we
first propose a multi-head structural relation layer to learn different
relations of neighbor body-component nodes in graphs, which helps aggregate key
correlative features for effective node representations. Second, inspired by
the fact that body-component collaboration in walking usually carries
recognizable patterns, we propose a cross-level collaborative relation layer to
infer collaboration between different level components, so as to capture more
discriminative skeleton graph features. Finally, to enhance graph dynamics
encoding, we propose a novel self-supervised sparse sequential prediction task
for model pre-training, which facilitates encoding high-level graph semantics

of the polarization orientation. We then re-examine the case of a medium that
both Faraday-rotates and emits polarized radiation and show how a helical

to resolve a source of confusion that has arisen between the plasma physics and

can be used to facilitate the field of climatic data processing. The idea of
this work is to convert relational climate data to the Resource Description
Framework (RDF) data model, so that it can be stored in a graph database and
easily accessed through the Web as Linked Data. Typically, this provides
climate researchers, who are interested in datasets such as NOAA, with the
potential of enriching and interlinking with other databases. As a result, our
approach facilitates data integration and analysis of diverse climatic data
sources and allows researchers to interrogate these sources directly on the Web

the spatial pattern, the 2D kernel encodes geometric information that is
crucial for 3D reconstruction tasks, while traditional ones mainly consider

large training data. The performance improvement was apparent, but the need for
sufficient training data and intensive learning hinders their applicability.
Moreover, using the fixed model at test time does not account for the fact that
a pair of images may require their own prior, thus providing limited
performance and poor generalization to unseen images. In this paper, we show
that an image pair-specific prior can be captured by solely optimizing the
untrained matching networks on an input pair of images. Tailored for such
test-time optimization for dense correspondence, we present a residual matching

convergence. Experiments demonstrate that our framework, dubbed Deep Matching
Prior (DMP), is competitive, or even outperforms, against the latest
learning-based methods on several benchmarks for geometric matching and
semantic matching, even though it requires neither large training data nor
intensive learning. With the networks pre-trained, DMP attains state-of-the-art

between dark matter and the baryonic component in the Einstein frame which is
removed by going to the Jordan frame using a disformal transformation giving
rise to an exotic effective fluid responsible for causing phantom crossing at
late times. In this scenario, past evolution is not distinguished from
$\Lambda$CDM but late time dynamics is generically different due to the
presence of phantom crossing that causes a monotonous increase in the expansion
rate giving rise to distinctive late-time cosmic feature. The latter can play a
crucial role in addressing the tension between the observed value of Hubble
parameter by CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) measurements and the local
observations. We demonstrate that the Hubble tension significantly reduces in
the scenario under consideration for the chosen scale factor parametrizations.
The estimated age of the universe in the model is well within the observational

Waveform Tailoring (VWT) was demonstrated to provide ultimate control of the

power absorption dynamics. However, at the fundamental level, the physical
origin of these effects of VWT remained unclear. Therefore, in this work, the
electron power absorption dynamics is investigated in a He/N$_2$ jet with a
nitrogen concentration of 0.05\% driven by a valleys waveform at a base
frequency of 13.56 MHz for different numbers of harmonics using a
self-consistent Particle in Cell simulation coupled with a spatio-temporally
resolved analysis of the electron power absorption based on the momentum
balance equation. Due to the local nature of the transport at atmospheric
pressure, ohmic power absorption is dominant. Increasing the number of
harmonics, due to the peculiar shape of the excitation waveform the sheath
collapse at the grounded electrode is shortened relative to the one at the
powered electrode. As a consequence, and in order to ensure flux compensation
of electrons and positive ions at this electrode, a high current is driven
through the discharge at the time of this short sheath collapse. This current
is driven by a high ohmic electric field. Close to the grounded electrode,
where the electron density is low and the electric field is high, electrons are
accelerated to high energies and strong ionization as well as the formation of
a local electron density maximum are observed. This electron density maximum
leads to a local ambipolar electric field that acts as an electric field
reversal and accelerates electrons to even higher energies. These effects are
understood in detail to fundamentally explain the unique potential of VWT for
EEDF control in such plasmas.

diffusion and stochastic acceleration. We consider different amount of net
vertical magnetic flux to achieve different disk magnetizations levels at
saturated states, with sufficiently high resolution to resolve the gyro-radii

height $H$) show spatial diffusion coefficients of $\sim30$ and $\sim5$ times
Bohm values in the azimuthal and poloidal directions, respectively. We further
measure particle momentum diffusion coefficient $D(p)$ by applying the
Fokker-Planck equation to particle momentum evolution. For these particles,
contribution from turbulent fluctuations scales as $D(p)\propto p$, and shear
acceleration takes over when $R_g\gtrsim0.1H$, characterized by $D(p)\propto

  Liquid Crystal Equations with Large Initial Data",,,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper is devoted to establishing the optimal decay rate of the global
large solution to compressible nematic liquid crystal equations when the
initial perturbation is large and belongs to $L^1(\mathbb R^3)\cap H^2(\mathbb
R^3)$. More precisely, we show that the first and second order spatial
derivatives of large solution $(\rho-1, u, \nabla d)(t)$ converges to zero at
the $L^2-$rate $(1+t)^{-\frac54}$ and $L^2-$rate $(1+t)^{-\frac74}$
respectively, which are optimal in the sense that they coincide with the decay
rates of solution to the heat equation. Thus, we establish optimal decay rate
for the second order derivative of global large solution studied in [12,18]
since the compressible nematic liquid crystal flow becomes the compressible
Navier-Stokes equations when the director is a constant vector. It is worth
noticing that there is no decay loss for the highest-order spatial derivative
of solution although the associated initial perturbation is large. Moreover, we
also establish the lower bound of decay rates of $(\rho-1, u, \nabla d)(t)$
itself and its spatial derivative, which coincide with the upper one.
Therefore, the decay rates of global large solution $\nabla^2(\rho-1,u,\nabla
d)(t)$ $(k=0,1,2)$ are actually optimal.

computational complexity on high resolution feature map while capturing local

the form of a multi-scale spatial bias to adjust features in multiple layers of
the Uformer decoder. Our modulator demonstrates superior capability for
restoring details for various image restoration tasks while introducing
marginal extra parameters and computational cost. Powered by these two designs,
Uformer enjoys a high capability for capturing both local and global

experiments are conducted on several image restoration tasks, including image
denoising, motion deblurring, defocus deblurring and deraining. Without bells

binary problems with uncertain cost-vectors. The idea of the approach is to
calculate a set of k feasible solutions which are worst-case optimal if in each
possible scenario the best of the k solutions is implemented. It is known that
the min-max-min robust problem can be solved efficiently if k is at least the
dimension of the problem, while it is theoretically and computationally hard if
k is small. While both cases are well studied in the literature nothing is
known about the intermediate cases, i.e. k lies between one and the dimension
of the problem. We approach this open question and provide an efficient
algorithm which achieves problem-specific additive and multiplicative
approximation guarantees for the cases where k is close to and where k is a
fraction of the dimension. The derived bounds can be used to show that the
min-max-min robust problem is solvable in oracle-polynomial time under certain
conditions even if k is smaller than the dimension. We show that the derived
approximation guarantees can be extended to the k-adaptability problem. As a
consequence we can provide better bounds on the number of required second-stage
policies to achieve a certain approximation guarantee for the exact two-stage
robust problem. Additionally we can show that these bounds are also promising
for recoverable robust optimization. Finally we incorporate our efficient
approximation algorithm into a branch & bound method to solve the min-max-min
problem for arbitrary values of k. The experiments show that the performance of
the branch & bound method scales well with the number of solutions, confirming
our theoretical insights. Thus we are able to solve instances where k is of
intermediate size efficiently.

displaced fluid in the vicinity of the randomly moving Brownian particle acts
back on the particle giving rise to long-range force correlations which
manifest as a ``long-time tail'' in the decay of the velocity autocorrelation

softmax-based inter-channel similarity between encoder representations, using
an unrolled probability and a normalized cosine-based similarity at the
dimensional-level. Moreover, new combination strategies of the CD-based spatial

investigated. Experiments on the reverberant WSJ0 2-mix show that the improved
CD can result in more discriminative differential information and the new
adaptation strategy is also very effective to improve the target speech

generalization of entanglement entropy such that it depends on both an initial

analyze a class of free scalar field theories and the XY spin model. This
reveals the basic properties of pseudo entropy in many-body systems, namely,
the area law behavior, the saturation behavior, and the non-positivity of

the strong subadditivity of pseudo entropy gets violated. Interestingly we find
that the non-positivity of the difference can be violated only if the initial
and final states belong to different quantum phases. We also present analytical
arguments which support these properties by both conformal field theoretic and
holographic calculations. When the initial and final states belong to different
topological phases, we expect a gapless mode localized along an interface,
which enhances the pseudo entropy leading to the violation of the
non-positivity of the difference. Moreover, we also compute the time evolution

candles'. It was thus inferred that the Hubble expansion rate is accelerating
as if driven by a positive Cosmological Constant $\Lambda$. This is still the
only direct evidence for the `dark energy' that is the dominant component of
the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model. Other data such as BAO, CMB
anisotropies, stellar ages, the rate of structure growth, etc are all
`concordant' with this model but do not provide independent evidence for
accelerated expansion. Analysis of a larger sample of 740 SNe Ia shows that
these are not quite standard candles, and highlights the ""corrections"" applied
to analyse the data in the FLRW framework. The latter holds in the reference
frame in which the CMB is isotropic, whereas observations are made in our
heliocentric frame in which the CMB has a large dipole anisotropy. This is
assumed to be of kinematic origin i.e. due to our non-Hubble motion driven by
local inhomogeneity in the matter distribution. The $\Lambda$CDM model predicts
how this peculiar velocity should fall off as the averaging scale is raised and
the universe becomes sensibly homogeneous. However observations of the local
`bulk flow' are inconsistent with this expectation and convergence to the CMB
frame is not seen. Moreover the kinematic interpretation implies a
corresponding dipole in the sky distribution of high redshift quasars, which is
rejected by observations at 4.9$\sigma$. The acceleration of the Hubble
expansion rate is also anisotropic at 3.9$\sigma$ and aligned with the bulk
flow. Thus dark energy may be an artefact of analysing data assuming that we
are idealised observers in an FLRW universe, when in fact the real universe is
inhomogeneous and anisotropic out to distances large enough to impact on
cosmological analyses.

In order to effectively measure the degree of linear polarization for the
absorption lines, a magnetic field strength of at least $10^3$ G is required.
The metal elements that produce the polarized absorption lines should be
sufficiently abundant and have large oscillation strengths or Einstein
absorption coefficients. We encourage both polarization measurements and
high-dispersion observations of the absorption lines in order to detect the
triplet structure in early GRB optical afterglows.

recent years. However, existing conditional inputs are suffering from either
unstructured forms (captions) or limited information and expensive labeling
(scene graphs). For a targeted scene, the core items, objects, are usually
definite while their interactions are flexible and hard to clearly define.
Thus, we introduce a more rational setting, generating a realistic image from
the objects and captions. Under this setting, objects explicitly define the
critical roles in the targeted images and captions implicitly describe their
rich attributes and connections. Correspondingly, a MOC-GAN is proposed to mix
the inputs of two modalities to generate realistic images. It firstly infers
the implicit relations between object pairs from the captions to build a
hidden-state scene graph. So a multi-layer representation containing objects,
relations and captions is constructed, where the scene graph provides the
structures of the scene and the caption provides the image-level guidance. Then
a cascaded attentive generative network is designed to coarse-to-fine generate
phrase patch by paying attention to the most relevant words in the caption. In
addition, a phrase-wise DAMSM is proposed to better supervise the fine-grained
phrase-patch consistency. On COCO dataset, our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on both Inception Score and FID while maintaining high
visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the unique features of our
proposed method.

provided by the spinning of a helical tail with respect to its body in a simple
shear flow. Thanks to an efficient computational strategy that allowed us to
simulate thousands of different trajectories, we show that the tail shape
dramatically affects the swimmer's motion. In the shear dominated regime, the
swimmers carrying an elliptical helical tail show several different
Jeffery-like (tumbling) trajectories depending on their initial configuration.
As the propulsion torque increases, a progressive regularization of the motion
is observed until, in the propulsion dominated regime, the swimmers converge to
the same final trajectory independently on the initial configuration. Overall,
our results show that elliptical helix swimmer presents a much richer variety
of trajectories with respect to the usually studied circular helix tails.

introduced a hybrid paradigm, physics-informed deep learning (PIDL), which
contains both model-driven and data-driven components. This paper contributes
an improved version, called physics-informed deep learning with a fundamental
diagram learner (PIDL+FDL), which integrates ML terms into the model-driven

mapping from traffic density to flow or velocity. The proposed PIDL+FDL has the
advantages of performing the TSE learning, model parameter identification, and
FD estimation simultaneously. We demonstrate the use of PIDL+FDL to solve
popular first-order and second-order traffic flow models and reconstruct the FD
relation as well as model parameters that are outside the FD terms. We then
evaluate the PIDL+FDL-based TSE using the Next Generation SIMulation (NGSIM)

realised in diverse biological and biomimetic systems. We introduce a continuum
model of polar active matter, based on conservation laws and symmetry
arguments, that recapitulates both polar and apolar (nematic) features of
topological defects in active turbulence. Using numerical simulations of the
continuum model, we demonstrate the emergence of both half- and full-integer
topological defects in polar active matter. Interestingly, we find that
crossover from active turbulence with half- to full-integer defects can emerge
with the coexistence region characterized by both defect types. These results
put forward a minimal, generic framework for studying topological defect
patterns in active matter which is capable of explaining the emergence of
half-integer defects in polar systems such as bacteria and cell monolayers, as
well as predicting the emergence of coexisting defect states in active matter.

Theorems in conservation laws. Several applications in flat spaces are
examined. A formulation of Noether's Theorems in curved space is presented. Of
particular interest is the conservation of energy in General Relativity. Here,
there is no general form for a conserved tensor, as there is in a flat space

special cases, one can formulate an equation for the conservation of energy.

image can be obtained from many high-resolution images. Recent studies for
super-resolution cannot create diverse super-resolution images. Although SRFlow
tried to account for ill-posed nature of the super-resolution by predicting
multiple high-resolution images given a low-resolution image, there is room to
improve the diversity and visual quality. In this paper, we propose Noise
Conditional flow model for Super-Resolution, NCSR, which increases the visual
quality and diversity of images through noise conditional layer. To learn more
diverse data distribution, we add noise to training data. However, low-quality
images are resulted from adding noise. We propose the noise conditional layer
to overcome this phenomenon. The noise conditional layer makes our model
generate more diverse images with higher visual quality than other works.
Furthermore, we show that this layer can overcome data distribution mismatch, a
problem that arises in normalizing flow models. With these benefits, NCSR
outperforms baseline in diversity and visual quality and achieves better visual
quality than traditional GAN-based models. We also get outperformed scores at

(GNNs) in the biomedical domain for tackling drug-related problems. However,
like any other deep architectures, GNNs are data hungry. While requiring labels
in real world is often expensive, pretraining GNNs in an unsupervised manner
has been actively explored. Among them, graph contrastive learning, by
maximizing the mutual information between paired graph augmentations, has been
shown to be effective on various downstream tasks. However, the current graph
contrastive learning framework has two limitations. First, the augmentations
are designed for general graphs and thus may not be suitable or powerful enough
for certain domains. Second, the contrastive scheme only learns representations
that are invariant to local perturbations and thus does not consider the global
structure of the dataset, which may also be useful for downstream tasks.
Therefore, in this paper, we study graph contrastive learning in the context of
biomedical domain, where molecular graphs are present. We propose a novel
framework called MoCL, which utilizes domain knowledge at both local- and
global-level to assist representation learning. The local-level domain
knowledge guides the augmentation process such that variation is introduced
without changing graph semantics. The global-level knowledge encodes the
similarity information between graphs in the entire dataset and helps to learn
representations with richer semantics. The entire model is learned through a
double contrast objective. We evaluate MoCL on various molecular datasets under
both linear and semi-supervised settings and results show that MoCL achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

feature structures (scripts) and script functions. Each word sense in a
language is mentally represented by an m-script, a script function which
embodies all the syntax and semantics of the word. M-scripts form a
fully-lexicalised unification grammar, which can support adult language. Each
word m-script can be learnt robustly from about six learning examples. The
theory has been implemented as a computer model, which can bootstrap-learn a
language from zero vocabulary. The Bayesian learning mechanism is (1) Capable:
to learn arbitrarily complex meanings and syntactic structures; (2) Fast:
learning these structures from a few examples each; (3) Robust: learning in the
presence of much irrelevant noise, and (4) Self-repairing: able to acquire
implicit negative evidence, using it to learn exceptions. Children learning
language are clearly all of (1) - (4), whereas connectionist theories fail on
(1) and (2), and symbolic theories fail on (3) and (4). The theory is in good
agreement with many key facts of language acquisition, including facts which
are problematic for other theories. It is compared with over 100 key

functions on Riemannian homogeneous spaces. Analagous to the result for
traditional convolutions, we prove that the Volterra functional convolutions
are equivariant to the action of the isometry group admitted by the Riemannian
homogeneous spaces, and under some restrictions, any non-linear equivariant
function can be expressed as our homogeneous space Volterra convolution,
generalizing the non-linear shift equivariant characterization of Volterra
expansions in Euclidean space. We also prove that second order functional
convolution operations can be represented as cascaded convolutions which leads
to an efficient implementation. Beyond this, we also propose a dilated
VolterraNet model. These advances lead to large parameter reductions relative
to baseline non-Euclidean CNNs. To demonstrate the efficacy of the VolterraNet
performance, we present several real data experiments involving classification
tasks on spherical-MNIST, atomic energy, Shrec17 data sets, and group testing
on diffusion MRI data. Performance comparisons to the state-of-the-art are also
presented.

  resource selection",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we use a New Radio (NR) Vehicular-to-everything (V2X) standard
compliant simulator based on ns-3, to study the impact of NR numerologies on
the end-to-end performance. In particular, we focus on NR V2X Mode 2, used for
autonomous resource selection in out-of-coverage communications, and consider
the two key procedures defined in 3GPP: sensing and non-sensing based resource
selection. We pay particular attention to the interplay between the operational
numerology and the resource selection window length, a key parameter of NR V2X
Mode 2. The results in a standard-compliant, end-to-end simulation platform
show that in all cases, for basic service messages, a higher numerology is
beneficial because of different reasons, depending on the way the resource
selection window length is established.

  learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In recent times, the trend in very large scale integration (VLSI) industry is
multi-dimensional, for example, reduction of energy consumption, occupancy of
less space, precise result, less power dissipation, faster response. To meet
these needs, the hardware architecture should be reliable and robust to these
problems. Recently, neural network and deep learning has been started to impact
the present research paradigm significantly which consists of parameters in the
order of millions, nonlinear function for activation, convolutional operation
for feature extraction, regression for classification, generative adversarial
networks. These operations involve huge calculation and memory overhead.
Presently available DSP processors are incapable of performing these operations
and they mostly face the problems, for example, memory overhead, performance
drop and compromised accuracy. Moreover, if a huge silicon area is powered to
accelerate the operation using parallel computation, the ICs will be having
significant chance of burning out due to the considerable generation of heat.
Hence, novel dark silicon constraint is developed to reduce the heat
dissipation without sacrificing the accuracy. Similarly, different algorithms
have been adapted to design a DSP processor compatible for fast performance in
neural network, activation function, convolutional neural network and
generative adversarial network. In this review, we illustrate the recent
developments in hardware for accelerating the efficient implementation of deep
learning networks with enhanced performance. The techniques investigated in
this review are expected to direct future research challenges of hardware
optimization for high-performance computations.

Divisor) of two positive numbers. There are various fields where this division
is used such as channel coding, cryptography, and error correction codes. This
makes the GCD a fundamental algorithm in number theory, so a number of methods
have been discovered to efficiently compute it. The main contribution of this
paper is to investigate a method that computes the GCD of two 32-bit numbers
based on Euclidean algorithm which targets six different Xilinx chips. The
complexity of this method that we call Optimized_GCDSAD is achieved by
utilizing Sum of Absolute Difference (SAD) block which is based on a fast
carry-out generation function. The efficiency of the proposed architecture is
evaluated based on criteria such as time (latency), area delay product (ADP)
and space (slice number) complexity. The VHDL codes of these architectures have
been implemented and synthesized through ISE 14.7. A detailed comparative
analysis indicates that the proposed Optimized_GCDSAD method based on SAD block
outperforms previously known results.

  Symposium (IGARSS), 2021",,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Air pollution has been a long-existing problem for most of the major
metropolitan cities of the world. Several measures including strict climate
laws and reduction in the number of vehicles were implemented by several
nations. However, in the recent wake of the COVID19 pandemic, there has been a
renewed interest in revisiting the problem of low air quality. Several
countries implemented strict lockdown measures halting the vehicular traffic
and other economic activities, in order to reduce the spread of COVID19. In
this paper, we analyze the impact of such COVID19-induced lockdown on the air
quality of the atmosphere. Our case study is based in the city of Dublin,
Ireland. We analyze the average concentration of common gaseous pollutant
majorly responsible for industrial and vehicular pollution, \textit{viz.}
nitrogen dioxide (NO$_2$). These concentrations are obtained from the
tropospheric column of the atmosphere collected by Sentinel-5P, which is an
earth observation satellite of European Space Agency. We observe that Dublin
had a significant drop in the level of NO$_2$ concentration, owing to the
strict lockdown measures implemented across the nation.
