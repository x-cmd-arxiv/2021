$U(1)_{L_\mu - L_{\tau}}$ gauge extension of the Standard Model. Heavy neutral
fermions alongside with a $S_1(\overline{3}$,$1$,$1/3$) scalar leptoquark and
an inert scalar doublet are added to address the flavor anomalies and light
neutrino mass respectively. The light gauge boson associated with
$U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge group mediates dark to visible sector and helps to
obtain the correct relic density. Aided with a colored scalar, we constrain the
new model parameters by using the branching ratios of various $b \to sll$ and
$b \to s \gamma$ decay processes as well as the lepton flavour non-universality
observables $R_{K^{(*)}}$ and then show the implication on the branching ratios
of some rare semileptonic $B \to (K^{(*)}, \phi)+$ missing energy, processes.

scientific knowledge, we have witnessed many deep learning applications for the
automatic classification of lightcurves. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are
one of the models used for these applications, and the LSTM unit stands out for
being an excellent choice for the representation of long time series. In
general, RNNs assume observations at discrete times, which may not suit the
irregular sampling of lightcurves. A traditional technique to address irregular
sequences consists of adding the sampling time to the network's input, but this
is not guaranteed to capture sampling irregularities during training.
Alternatively, the Phased LSTM unit has been created to address this problem by
updating its state using the sampling times explicitly. In this work, we study
the effectiveness of the LSTM and Phased LSTM based architectures for the
classification of astronomical lightcurves. We use seven catalogs containing
periodic and nonperiodic astronomical objects. Our findings show that LSTM
outperformed PLSTM on 6/7 datasets. However, the combination of both units
enhances the results in all datasets.

sciences, epidemiology, or physics. A common phenomenon in many spatial
regression models is spatial confounding. This phenomenon takes place when
spatially indexed covariates modeling the mean of the response are correlated
with the spatial random effect. As a result, estimates for regression
coefficients of the covariates can be severely biased and interpretation of
these is no longer valid. Recent literature has shown that typical solutions
for reducing spatial confounding can lead to misleading and counterintuitive
results. In this paper, we develop a computationally efficient spatial model in
a Bayesian framework integrating novel prior structure that reduces spatial
confounding. Starting from the univariate case, we extend our prior structure
to case of multiple spatially confounded covariates. In a simulation study, we
show that our novel model flexibly detects and reduces spatial confounding in
spatial datasets, and it performs better than typically used methods such as
restricted spatial regression. These results are promising for any applied
researcher who wishes to interpret covariate effects in spatial regression
models. As a real data illustration, we study the effect of elevation and
temperature on the mean of daily precipitation in Germany.

It
is a natural consequence of additional discrete degree of freedom associated
with a valley or the occurence of electronic flat-bands. Combination of both
types of lattices, observed in CoSn-like compounds, leads not only to the
topological electronic behavior, but also to the emergence of chiral phonon
modes. Here, we study CoSn-like compounds in the context of realization of
chiral phonons. Previous theoretical studies demonstrated that the chiral
phonons can be found in ideal two-dimensional hexagonal or kagome lattices.
However, it turns out that in the case of CoSn-like systems with the $P6/mmm$
symmetry, the kagome lattice formed by $d$-block element is decorated by the
additional $p$-block atom. This results in a two dimensional triangular lattice
of atoms with non-equal masses and the absence of chiral phonons in the kagome
plane. Contrary to this, the interlayer hexagonal lattice of $p$-block atoms is
preserved and allows for the realization of chiral phonons. We discuss
properties of these chiral phonons in seven CoSn-like compounds and demonstrate
that they do not depend on atomic mass ratio or the presence of intrinsic
magnetic order. The chiral phonons of $d$-block atoms can be restored by
removing the inversion symmetry. The latter is possible in the crystal
structure of CoGe and RhPb with the reduced symmetry ($P\bar{6}2m$) and
distorted-kagome-like lattice.

detectable by current Earth bound detectors. Extracting these signals from the
instruments' background noise is a complex problem and the computational cost
of most current searches depends on the complexity of the source model. Deep
learning may be capable of finding signals where current algorithms hit
computational limits. Here we restrict our analysis to signals from
non-spinning binary black holes and systematically test different strategies by
which training data is presented to the networks. To assess the impact of the
training strategies, we re-analyze the first published networks and directly
compare them to an equivalent matched-filter search. We find that the deep
learning algorithms can generalize low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals to
high SNR ones but not vice versa. As such, it is not beneficial to provide high
SNR signals during training, and fastest convergence is achieved when low SNR
samples are provided early on. During testing we found that the networks are
sometimes unable to recover any signals when a false alarm probability
$<10^{-3}$ is required. We resolve this restriction by applying a modification
we call unbounded Softmax replacement (USR) after training. With this
alteration we find that the machine learning search retains $\geq 91.5\%$ of
the sensitivity of the matched-filter search down to a false-alarm rate of 1
per month.

range of methods is available for any given imputation task. How does one
choose the `best' imputation method in a given application? The standard
approach is to select some observations, set their status to missing, and
compare prediction accuracy of the methods under consideration of these
observations. Besides having to somewhat artificially mask observations, a
shortcoming of this approach is that imputations based on the conditional mean
will rank highest if predictive accuracy is measured with quadratic loss. In
contrast, we want to rank highest an imputation that can sample from the true
conditional distributions. In this paper, we develop a framework called
""Imputation Scores"" (I-Scores) for assessing missing value imputations. We
provide a specific I-Score based on density ratios and projections, that is
applicable to discrete and continuous data. It does not require to mask
additional observations for evaluations and is also applicable if there are no
complete observations. The population version is shown to be proper in the
sense that the highest rank is assigned to an imputation method that samples
from the correct conditional distribution. The propriety is shown under the
missing completely at random (MCAR) assumption but is also shown to be valid
under missing at random (MAR) with slightly more restrictive assumptions. We
show empirically on a range of data sets and imputation methods that our score
consistently ranks true data high(est) and is able to avoid pitfalls usually
associated with performance measures such as RMSE. Finally, we provide the
R-package Iscores available on CRAN with an implementation of our method.

alternative to Convolutional networks (CNNs). Differently from CNNs, VTs can
capture global relations between image elements and they potentially have a
larger representation capacity. However, the lack of the typical convolutional
inductive bias makes these models more data-hungry than common CNNs. In fact,
some local properties of the visual domain which are embedded in the CNN
architectural design, in VTs should be learned from samples. In this paper, we
empirically analyse different VTs, comparing their robustness in a small
training-set regime, and we show that, despite having a comparable accuracy
when trained on ImageNet, their performance on smaller datasets can be largely
different. Moreover, we propose a self-supervised task which can extract
additional information from images with only a negligible computational
overhead. This task encourages the VTs to learn spatial relations within an
image and makes the VT training much more robust when training data are scarce.
Our task is used jointly with the standard (supervised) training and it does
not depend on specific architectural choices, thus it can be easily plugged in
the existing VTs. Using an extensive evaluation with different VTs and
datasets, we show that our method can improve (sometimes dramatically) the

  2021)",,,"quant-ph stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  It has been hypothesized that quantum computers may lend themselves well to
applications in machine learning. In the present work, we analyze function
classes defined via quantum kernels. Quantum computers offer the possibility to
efficiently compute inner products of exponentially large density operators
that are classically hard to compute. However, having an exponentially large
feature space renders the problem of generalization hard. Furthermore, being
able to evaluate inner products in high dimensional spaces efficiently by
itself does not guarantee a quantum advantage, as already classically tractable
kernels can correspond to high- or infinite-dimensional reproducing kernel
Hilbert spaces (RKHS).
  We analyze the spectral properties of quantum kernels and find that we can
expect an advantage if their RKHS is low dimensional and contains functions
that are hard to compute classically. If the target function is known to lie in
this class, this implies a quantum advantage, as the quantum computer can
encode this inductive bias, whereas there is no classically efficient way to
constrain the function class in the same way. However, we show that finding
suitable quantum kernels is not easy because the kernel evaluation might
require exponentially many measurements.
  In conclusion, our message is a somewhat sobering one: we conjecture that
quantum machine learning models can offer speed-ups only if we manage to encode
knowledge about the problem at hand into quantum circuits, while encoding the
same bias into a classical model would be hard. These situations may plausibly
occur when learning on data generated by a quantum process, however, they
appear to be harder to come by for classical datasets.

the same fundamental problems: participant solutions to the posed challenge are
usually domain-specific, biased to maximally exploit compute resources, and not

competition design that promotes the development of algorithms that overcome
these barriers. We propose four central mechanisms for achieving this end:
submission retraining, domain randomization, desemantization through domain

attached to every metric space - in particular, to every finite simple

it is multi-affine and real-stable (leading to a hitherto unstudied
delta-matroid for each graph $G$). Second, the polynomial specializes to (a
transform of) the characteristic polynomial $\chi_{D_G}$ of the distance matrix
$D_G$; as well as recovers the entire graph, where $\chi_{D_G}$ cannot do so.
Third, the polynomial encodes the determinants of a family of graphs formed
from $G$, called the blowups of $G$.
  In this short note, we exhibit the applicability of these tools and
techniques to other graph-matrices and their characteristic polynomials. As a
particular case, we will see that the adjacency characteristic polynomial

that combines prior knowledge on the drug-disease-patient system with patient
data from therapeutic drug/ biomarker monitoring (TDM) to support
individualized dosing in ongoing treatment.Structural models and prior
parameter distributions used in MIPD approaches typically build on prior
clinical trials that involve only a limited number of patients selected
according to some exclusion/inclusion criteria. Compared to the prior clinical
trial population, the patient population in clinical practice can be expected
to include also altered behavior and/or increased interindividual variability,
the extent of which, however, is typically unknown. Here, we address the
question of how to adapt and refine models on the level of the model parameters
to better reflect this real-world diversity. We propose an approach for
continued learning across patients during MIPD using a sequential hierarchical
Bayesian framework. The approach builds on two stages to separate the update of
the individual patient parameters from updating the population parameters.
Consequently, it enables continued learning across hospitals or study centers,
since only summary patient data (on the level of model parameters) need to be
shared, but no individual TDM data. We illustrate this continued learning
approach with neutrophil-guided dosing of paclitaxel. The present study
constitutes an important step towards building confidence in MIPD and
eventually establishing MIPD increasingly in everyday therapeutic use.

used to overcome the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) that bounds the precision of
sensors that operate with independent particles. Measurements beyond the SQL
are typically enabled by relatively simple entangled states (squeezed states
with Gaussian probability distributions), where quantum noise is redistributed
between different quadratures. However, due to both fundamental limitations and
the finite measurement resolution achieved in practice, sensors based on
squeezed states typically operate far from the true fundamental limit of
quantum metrology, the Heisenberg Limit. Here, by implementing an effective
time-reversal protocol through a controlled sign change in an optically
engineered many-body Hamiltonian, we demonstrate atomic-sensor performance with
non-Gaussian states beyond the limitations of spin squeezing, and without the
requirement of extreme measurement resolution. Using a system of 350 neutral
$^{171}$Yb atoms, this signal amplification through time-reversed interaction
(SATIN) protocol achieves the largest sensitivity improvement beyond the SQL
($11.8 \pm 0.5$~dB) demonstrated in any interferometer to date. Furthermore, we
demonstrate a precision improving in proportion to the particle number
(Heisenberg scaling), at fixed distance of 12.6~dB from the Heisenberg Limit.
These results pave the way for quantum metrology using complex entangled
states, with potential broad impact in science and technology. Potential
applications include searches for dark matter and for physics beyond the

squared-to-volume ratio given by the Rayleigh limit. The instability leads to
ion ejection from jets formed on the droplet's surface. Despite the many
experiments that have been performed to capture the jet formation the precise
fission mechanism has not yet been observed because of its brief transient
nature. Here, we present the first atomistic simulations that reveal the
mechanism of Rayleigh fission. We demonstrate that ion ejection takes place
through a drop's deformation from a spherical into a distinct shape that
contains a conical protrusion. We assert that the latter state is a free energy
minimum along an order parameter that measures the degree of droplet
asphericity. The charged droplet's long-time evolution proceeds by alternating
between the two minima above and below the critical value that are reached
through solvent evaporation and ion ejection, respectively. For the first time,
this mechanism allows one to explain the nature of the progeny droplets and the
percentage of charge lost during fission. We determine that the cone half-angle
is close to the value predicted from the solution of the electrostatic equation
for the dielectric liquid. It is found that the conical deformation is
independent of the effect of electrohydrodynamic forces reported in
experiments. Contrary to the experimental observations of two diametrically
opposite jets for droplets suspended in the electric field, we found that a
single jet is formed at the Rayleigh limit. This indicates that super-charged
droplet states may have been detected in the experiments.

context of conical intersections. In such a case, unphysical consequences are
encountered such as a wrong dimension of the intersection seam, large numerical
deviations from full configuration-interaction (FCI) results, and the
square-root-like behaviour of the potential surfaces near the conical
intersection. In the case of CC calculations with complex-valued Hamiltonian
matrix elements, it turns out that complex energy values are to be expected for
ground and excited states when no symmetry is present. We confirm the
occurrence of complex energies by sample calculations using a six-state model
and by CC calculations for the H2O molecule in a strong magnetic field. We
furthermore show that symmetry can prevent the occurrence of complex energy
values. Lastly, we demonstrate that in most cases the real part of the complex
energy values provides a very good approximation to the FCI energy.

  infection-age dependent infectivity",,,,,"math.PR","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  We study epidemic models where the infectivity of each individual is a random
function of the infection age (the elapsed time of infection). To describe the
epidemic evolution dynamics, we use a stochastic process that tracks the number
of individuals at each time that have been infected for less than or equal to a
certain amount of time, together with the aggregate infectivity process. We
establish the functional law of large numbers (FLLN) for the stochastic
processes that describe the epidemic dynamics. The limits are described by a
set of deterministic integral equations, which has a further characterization
using PDEs under some regularity conditions. The solutions are characterized
with boundary conditions that are given by a system of Volterra equations. We
also characterize the equilibrium points for the PDEs in the SIS model with
infection-age dependent infectivity. To establish the FLLNs, we employ a useful
criterion for weak convergence for the two-parameter processes together with
useful representations for the relevant processes via Poisson random measures.

  B1259-63",,,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  PSR B1259-63 is a gamma-ray binary system hosting a radio pulsar orbiting
around a O9.5Ve star, LS 2883, with a period of ~3.4 years. The interaction of
the pulsar wind with the LS 2883 outflow leads to unpulsed broadband emission
in the radio, X-ray, GeV, and TeV domains. One of the most unusual features of
the system is an outburst at GeV energies around the periastron, during which
the energy release substantially exceeds the spin down luminosity under the
assumption of the isotropic energy release. In this paper, we present the first
results of a recent multi-wavelength campaign (radio, optical, and X-ray bands)
accompanied by the analysis of publicly available GeV Fermi/LAT data. The
campaign covered a period of more than 100 days around the 2021 periastron and
revealed substantial differences from previously observed passages. We report a
major delay of the GeV flare, weaker X-ray flux during the peaks, which are
typically attributed to the times when the pulsar crosses the disk, and the
appearance of a third X-ray peak never observed before. We argue that these
features are consistent with the emission cone model of Chernyakova et al
(2020) in the case of a sparser and clumpier disk of the Be star.

improving parameter sharing in multi-task learning (MTL) and in scaling
high-capacity neural networks. State-of-the-art MoE models use a trainable
sparse gate to select a subset of the experts for each input example. While
conceptually appealing, existing sparse gates, such as Top-k, are not smooth.
The lack of smoothness can lead to convergence and statistical performance
issues when training with gradient-based methods. In this paper, we develop
DSelect-k: a continuously differentiable and sparse gate for MoE, based on a
novel binary encoding formulation. The gate can be trained using first-order
methods, such as stochastic gradient descent, and offers explicit control over
the number of experts to select. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DSelect-k
on both synthetic and real MTL datasets with up to $128$ tasks. Our experiments
indicate that DSelect-k can achieve statistically significant improvements in
prediction and expert selection over popular MoE gates. Notably, on a
real-world, large-scale recommender system, DSelect-k achieves over $22\%$
improvement in predictive performance compared to Top-k. We provide an
open-source implementation of DSelect-k.

probability of a false positive (incorrect face match) strongly depends on
sensitive attributes such as the ethnicity of the face. As a result, these
models can disproportionately and negatively impact minority groups,
particularly when used by law enforcement. The majority of bias reduction
methods have several drawbacks: they use an end-to-end retraining approach, may
not be feasible due to privacy issues, and often reduce accuracy. An
alternative approach is post-processing methods that build fairer decision
classifiers using the features of pre-trained models, thus avoiding the cost of
retraining. However, they still have drawbacks: they reduce accuracy (AGENDA,
PASS, FTC), or require retuning for different false positive rates (FSN). In
this work, we introduce the Fairness Calibration (FairCal) method, a
post-training approach that simultaneously: (i) increases model accuracy
(improving the state-of-the-art), (ii) produces fairly-calibrated
probabilities, (iii) significantly reduces the gap in the false positive rates,
(iv) does not require knowledge of the sensitive attribute, and (v) does not
require retraining, training an additional model, or retuning. We apply it to
the task of Face Verification, and obtain state-of-the-art results with all the
above advantages.

commonly occurs in deep randomly initialized neural networks. Leveraging an
in-depth analysis of neural chains, we first show that vanishing gradients
cannot be circumvented when the network width scales with less than O(depth),
even when initialized with the popular Xavier and He initializations. Second,
we extend the analysis to second-order derivatives and show that random i.i.d.
initialization also gives rise to Hessian matrices with eigenspectra that
vanish as networks grow in depth. Whenever this happens, optimizers are
initialized in a very flat, saddle point-like plateau, which is particularly
hard to escape with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as its escaping time is
inversely related to curvature. We believe that this observation is crucial for
fully understanding (a) historical difficulties of training deep nets with
vanilla SGD, (b) the success of adaptive gradient methods (which naturally
adapt to curvature and thus quickly escape flat plateaus) and (c) the
effectiveness of modern architectural components like residual connections and
normalization layers.

domains (text, images, videos, proteins, etc.) with little or no change to
architecture components. We perform a theoretical analysis of the core
component responsible for signal propagation between elements, i.e. the
self-attention matrix. In practice, this matrix typically exhibits two
properties: (1) it is sparse, meaning that each token only attends to a small
subset of other tokens; and (2) it changes dynamically depending on the input
to the module. With these considerations in mind, we ask the following
question: Can a fixed self-attention module approximate arbitrary sparse
patterns depending on the input? How small is the hidden size $d$ required for
such approximation? We make progress in answering this question and show that
the self-attention matrix can provably approximate sparse matrices, where
sparsity is in terms of a bounded number of nonzero elements in each row and
column. While the parameters of self-attention are fixed, various sparse
matrices can be approximated by only modifying the inputs. Our proof is based
on the random projection technique and uses the seminal Johnson-Lindenstrauss
lemma. Our proof is constructive, enabling us to propose an algorithm for
finding adaptive inputs and fixed self-attention parameters in order to
approximate a given matrix. In particular, we show that, in order to
approximate any sparse matrix up to a given precision defined in terms of
preserving matrix element ratios, $d$ grows only logarithmically with the
sequence length $L$ (i.e. $d = O(\log L)$).

reparametrization and a flexible multi-task architecture - each encoding
inductive bias favoring shared behavior across POs. To build understanding of

because data exist only for uniaxial compression these assumptions are

considering errors in B-factors from all sources in a consolidated manner and
conversion of the fluctuations to the same temperature have been suggested and
validated. Results indicate no differences in the global values like average
packing factor among the three classes of protein homologs but at local levels
there are differences. Comparison of homologous proteins triplets show that the
average atomic fluctuations at a given temperature obey the order P>M>T.
Packing factors and the atomic fluctuations are anti-correlated suggesting that
altering the rigidity of the active site might be a potential strategy to make
tailor made psychrophilic or thermophilic proteins from their mesophilic
homologs.

circuit models which could realize novel physics. A promising candidate is a
class of hybrid circuits, where entangling unitary dynamics compete with
disentangling measurements. Novel phase transitions between different
entanglement regimes have been identified in their dynamical states, with
universal properties hinting at unexplored critical phenomena. Trapped ion
hardware is a leading contender for the experimental realization of such
physics, which requires not only traditional two-qubit entangling gates, but a
constant rate of local measurements accurately addressed throughout the
circuit. Recent progress in engineering high-precision optical addressing of
individual ions makes preparing a constant rate of measurements throughout a
unitary circuit feasible. Using tensor network simulations, we show that the
resulting class of hybrid circuits, prepared with native gates, exhibits a
volume-law to area-law transition in the entanglement entropy. This displays
universal hallmarks of a measurement-induced phase transition. Our simulations
are able to characterize the critical exponents using circuit sizes with tens
of qubits and thousands of gates. We argue that this transition should be
robust against additional sources of experimental noise expected in modern
trapped ion hardware, and will rather be limited by statistical requirements on
post selection. Our work highlights the powerful role that tensor network
simulations can play in advancing the theoretical and experimental frontiers of
critical phenomena.

insight into inter-particle granular contact. For conservative spherical
particle systems, i.e. frictionless and undamped, force chains are information
complete due to symmetries resulting from isotropy and constant curvature of a
sphere. In fact, for conservative spherical particle systems, given the
geometry and material, the force chain network uniquely defines the contact
state that includes elastic forces, penetration distance, overlap volume,
contact areas and contact pressures in a particle system. This is, however, not
the case for conservative non-spherical particle systems. The reason is that a
force chain network is not sufficient to uniquely define the contact state in a
conservative non-spherical particle system. Additional information is required
to define the contact state of non-spherical granular systems. Traction chain
networks are proposed to complement force chain networks for the improved
quantification of the state of contact of a granular system.

understanding. Most state-of-the-art approaches rely on first estimating poses
in each frame and only then implementing data association and refinement.
Despite the promising results achieved, such a strategy is inevitably prone to
missed detections especially in heavily-cluttered scenes, since this
tracking-by-detection paradigm is, by nature, largely dependent on visual
evidences that are absent in the case of occlusion. In this paper, we propose a
novel online approach to learning the pose dynamics, which are independent of
pose detections in current fame, and hence may serve as a robust estimation
even in challenging scenarios including occlusion. Specifically, we derive this
prediction of dynamics through a graph neural network~(GNN) that explicitly
accounts for both spatial-temporal and visual information. It takes as input
the historical pose tracklets and directly predicts the corresponding poses in
the following frame for each tracklet. The predicted poses will then be
aggregated with the detected poses, if any, at the same frame so as to produce
the final pose, potentially recovering the occluded joints missed by the
estimator. Experiments on PoseTrack 2017 and PoseTrack 2018 datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves results superior to the state of
the art on both human pose estimation and tracking tasks.

observed target backgrounds and foregrounds. On the other hand, statistical
learning in imagery domains has been a prevalent approach with high adaptation
to dynamic context transformation, notably using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
with its generalization capabilities. By leveraging both, we propose a novel

an unsupervised GMM statistical learning strategy to describe observed scenes'
salient features. The second one, MEDAL-net, implements a light-weighted

In this paper, we present X2Parser, a transferable Cross-lingual and

hierarchical representations for nested intents and slots, we propose to
predict flattened intents and slots representations separately and cast both
prediction tasks into sequence labeling problems. After that, we further
propose a fertility-based slot predictor that first learns to dynamically
detect the number of labels for each token, and then predicts the slot types.
Experimental results illustrate that our model can significantly outperform
existing strong baselines in cross-lingual and cross-domain settings, and our
model can also achieve a good generalization ability on target languages of
target domains. Furthermore, our model tackles the problem in an efficient
non-autoregressive way that reduces the latency by up to 66% compared to the

showing that CURL is a subclass of MFGs. We think this important to bridge

half a dozen interactions where, each time, we ask only four questions).

monitor visual field (VF) loss in glaucoma management, but is prone to
intra-subject variability. We developed and validated a deep learning (DL)
regression model that estimates pointwise and overall VF loss from unsegmented
optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans. Methods: Eight DL regression models
were trained with various retinal imaging modalities: circumpapillary OCT at
3.5mm, 4.1mm, 4.7mm diameter, and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) en face
images to estimate mean deviation (MD) and 52 threshold values. This
retrospective study used data from patients who underwent a complete glaucoma
examination, including a reliable Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) 24-2 SITA
Standard VF exam and a SPECTRALIS OCT scan using the Glaucoma Module Premium
Edition. Results: A total of 1378 matched OCT-VF pairs of 496 patients (863
eyes) were included for training and evaluation of the DL models. Average
sample MD was -7.53dB (from -33.8dB to +2.0dB). For 52 VF threshold values
estimation, the circumpapillary OCT scan with the largest radius (4.7mm)
achieved the best performance among all individual models (Pearson r=0.77, 95%
CI=[0.72-0.82]). For MD, prediction averaging of OCT-trained models (3.5mm,
4.1mm, 4.7mm) resulted in a Pearson r of 0.78 [0.73-0.83] on the validation set
and comparable performance on the test set (Pearson r=0.79 [0.75-0.82]).
Conclusion: DL on unsegmented OCT scans accurately predicts pointwise and mean
deviation of 24-2 VF in glaucoma patients. Automated VF from unsegmented OCT
could be a solution for patients unable to produce reliable perimetry results.

  Networks",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neural network compression techniques have become increasingly popular as
they can drastically reduce the storage and computation requirements for very
large networks. Recent empirical studies have illustrated that even simple
pruning strategies can be surprisingly effective, and several theoretical
studies have shown that compressible networks (in specific senses) should
achieve a low generalization error. Yet, a theoretical characterization of the
underlying cause that makes the networks amenable to such simple compression
schemes is still missing. In this study, we address this fundamental question
and reveal that the dynamics of the training algorithm has a key role in
obtaining such compressible networks. Focusing our attention on stochastic
gradient descent (SGD), our main contribution is to link compressibility to two
recently established properties of SGD: (i) as the network size goes to
infinity, the system can converge to a mean-field limit, where the network
weights behave independently, (ii) for a large step-size/batch-size ratio, the
SGD iterates can converge to a heavy-tailed stationary distribution. In the
case where these two phenomena occur simultaneously, we prove that the networks
are guaranteed to be '$\ell_p$-compressible', and the compression errors of
different pruning techniques (magnitude, singular value, or node pruning)
become arbitrarily small as the network size increases. We further prove
generalization bounds adapted to our theoretical framework, which indeed
confirm that the generalization error will be lower for more compressible
networks. Our theory and numerical study on various neural networks show that
large step-size/batch-size ratios introduce heavy-tails, which, in combination
with overparametrization, result in compressibility.

addressed directly (for the first time) by performing calculations with and
without assumption of locality of the corresponding diagrams. For this purpose
we use sc(GW+G3W2) approach where the higher order part (G3W2) is evaluated
with fully momentum dependent Green's function G and screened interaction W and
with ""local"" variant, where the single site approximation is assumed for both G

they, in fact, are decisive for the proper evaluation of vertex corrections.
The results of this study have direct impact on our understanding of

fact that the first diagrams beyond GW represent the most important

generation speed for sample quality through adjusting the number of refinement

generating high resolution solar images we use the Pix2PixHD and Pix2Pix

resolution image generation tasks, and the Pix2Pix algorithm is by far the most
widely used image to image translation algorithm. For training and testing we
used the data for the year 2012, 2013 and 2014. The results show that our deep

Correlation Coefficient of the images generated by Pix2PixHD and original

obtained by previous works done by others to generate AIA0304 images. Thus, we
can use these models to generate AIA0304 images when the AIA0304 data is not
available which can be used for understanding space weather and giving
researchers the capability to predict solar events such as Solar Flares and
Coronal Mass Ejections. As far as we know, our work is the first attempt to

Online, this repository is used to rewrite the query and then lookup the

Recently generative retrieval models have been shown to be effective at the
task of generating such query rewrites. We observe two main limitations of such

lexical diversity, and hence the rewrites fail to retrieve relevant keywords
that have diverse linguistic variations. Second, there is a misalignment

CLOVER, a framework to generate both high-quality and diverse rewrites by
optimizing for human assessment of rewrite quality using our diversity-driven

applications in network analysis. The main challenge for designing efficient
exact algorithms is that a single update to the graph can cause significant
global changes. Our paper focuses on \emph{approximation} algorithms with small
approximation factors that are much more efficient than what exact algorithms
can obtain.
  We present the first parallel, batch-dynamic algorithm for approximate
$k$-core decomposition that is efficient in both theory and practice. Our
algorithm is based on our novel parallel level data structure, inspired by the
sequential level data structures of Bhattacharya et al [STOC '15] and Henzinger
et al [2020]. Given a graph with $n$ vertices and a batch of updates
$\mathcal{B}$, our algorithm provably maintains a $(2 +
\varepsilon)$-approximation of the coreness values of all vertices (for any
constant $\varepsilon > 0$) in $O(|\mathcal{B}|\log^2 n)$ amortized work and
$O(\log^2 n \log\log n)$ depth (parallel time) with high probability.
  As a by-product, our $k$-core decomposition algorithm also gives a
batch-dynamic algorithm for maintaining an $O(\alpha)$ out-degree orientation,
where $\alpha$ is the current arboricity of the graph. We demonstrate the
usefulness of our low out-degree orientation algorithm by presenting a new
framework to formally study batch-dynamic algorithms in bounded-arboricity
graphs. Our framework obtains new provably-efficient parallel batch-dynamic
algorithms for maximal matching, clique counting, and vertex coloring.

torus $\Lambda=(L\mathbb{T})^3$ that exhibits Bose-Einstein condensation,
beyond the leading order Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) fluctuations. Given a
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with density $N$ surrounded by thermal
fluctuations with density $1$, we assume that the system is described by a
mean-field Hamiltonian. We extract a quantum Boltzmann type dynamics from a
second-order Duhamel expansion upon subtracting both the BEC dynamics and the
HFB dynamics. Using a Fock-space approach, we provide explicit error bounds. It
is known that the BEC and the HFB fluctuations both evolve at microscopic time
scales $t\sim1$. Given a quasifree initial state, we determine the time
evolution of the centered correlation functions $\langle a\rangle$, $\langle
aa\rangle-\langle a\rangle^2$, $\langle a^+a\rangle-|\langle a\rangle|^2$ at
mesoscopic time scales $t\sim\lambda^{-2}$, where $0<\lambda\ll1$ denotes the
size of the HFB interaction. For large but finite $N$, we consider both the
case of fixed system size $L\sim1$, and the case $L\sim \lambda^{-2-}$. In the
case $L\sim1$, we show that the Boltzmann collision operator contains
subleading terms that can become dominant, depending on time-dependent
coefficients assuming particular values in $\mathbb{Q}$; this phenomenon is
reminiscent of the Talbot effect. For the case $L\sim \lambda^{-2-}$, we prove
that the collision operator is well approximated by the expression predicted in
the literature. In either of those cases, we have $\lambda\sim \Big(\frac{\log
\log N}{\log N}\Big)^{\alpha}$, for different values of $\alpha>0$.

if they qualify for high-stakes opportunities. A recent line of research
investigates how strategic agents may respond to such scoring tools to receive
favorable assessments. While prior work has focused on the short-term strategic
interactions between a decision-making institution (modeled as a principal) and
individual decision-subjects (modeled as agents), we investigate interactions
spanning multiple time-steps. In particular, we consider settings in which the
agent's effort investment today can accumulate over time in the form of an
internal state - impacting both his future rewards and that of the principal.
We characterize the Stackelberg equilibrium of the resulting game and provide
novel algorithms for computing it. Our analysis reveals several intriguing
insights about the role of multiple interactions in shaping the game's outcome:
First, we establish that in our stateful setting, the class of all linear
assessment policies remains as powerful as the larger class of all monotonic
assessment policies. While recovering the principal's optimal policy requires
solving a non-convex optimization problem, we provide polynomial-time
algorithms for recovering both the principal and agent's optimal policies under
common assumptions about the process by which effort investments convert to
observable features. Most importantly, we show that with multiple rounds of
interaction at her disposal, the principal is more effective at incentivizing
the agent to accumulate effort in her desired direction. Our work addresses
several critical gaps in the growing literature on the societal impacts of
automated decision-making - by focusing on longer time horizons and accounting
for the compounding nature of decisions individuals receive over time.

stochastic process, known as the first passage time, is of interest in many
areas of sciences and engineering. Conventionally, there is an implicit
assumption that the notional 'sensor' monitoring the threshold crossing event
is always active. In many realistic scenarios, the sensor monitoring the
stochastic process works intermittently. Then, the relevant quantity of
interest is the $\textit{first detection time}$, which denotes the time when
the sensor detects the threshold crossing event for the first time. In this
work, a birth-death process monitored by a random intermittent sensor is
studied, for which the first detection time distribution is obtained. In
general, it is shown that the first detection time is related to, and is
obtainable from, the first passage time distribution. Our analytical results
display an excellent agreement with simulations. Further, this framework is
demonstrated in several applications -- the SIS compartmental and logistic

  Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider a transfer Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem in
continuous state and action spaces, under unobserved contextual information.
For example, the context can represent the mental view of the world that an
expert agent has formed through past interactions with this world. We assume
that this context is not accessible to a learner agent who can only observe the
expert data. Then, our goal is to use the context-aware expert data to learn an
optimal context-unaware policy for the learner using only a few new data
samples. Such problems are typically solved using imitation learning that
assumes that both the expert and learner agents have access to the same
information. However, if the learner does not know the expert context, using
the expert data alone will result in a biased learner policy and will require
many new data samples to improve. To address this challenge, in this paper, we
formulate the learning problem as a causal bound-constrained Multi-Armed-Bandit
(MAB) problem. The arms of this MAB correspond to a set of basis policy
functions that can be initialized in an unsupervised way using the expert data
and represent the different expert behaviors affected by the unobserved
context. On the other hand, the MAB constraints correspond to causal bounds on
the accumulated rewards of these basis policy functions that we also compute
from the expert data. The solution to this MAB allows the learner agent to
select the best basis policy and improve it online. And the use of causal
bounds reduces the exploration variance and, therefore, improves the learning
rate. We provide numerical experiments on an autonomous driving example that
show that our proposed transfer RL method improves the learner's policy faster
compared to existing imitation learning methods and enjoys much lower variance
during training.

problem is an instance of infinite dimensional optimization over two continuous

proposes a method to quickly generate minimal-length paths between start and

curvature. Furthermore, we discretize the set of velocity profiles along a
given path into a selection of acceleration way-points along the path.
Gradient-descent is then employed to minimize cost over feasible choices of the
second derivative of curvature, and acceleration way-points, resulting in a
method that repeatedly solves the path and velocity profiles in an iterative
fashion. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the benefits of the

glass. This phase exhibits an emergent conformal symmetry in the strong
coupling regime, which dictates its thermodynamic properties. It is associated
with an extensive number of nearby states in the free energy landscape. We
discuss in detail an elegant approximate solution to the spin glass equations,
which interpolates between the conformal regime and an ultraviolet-complete
short distance solution. In the second half of this paper we explore the
real-time dynamics of the model and uncover quantum chaos as measured by
out-of-time-order four-point functions, both numerically and analytically. We
find exponential Lyapunov growth, which intricately depends on the model's

that the spin glass phase also exhibits quantum chaos, albeit with
parametrically smaller Lyapunov exponent than in the replica symmetric phase.

I/O access patterns to reduce I/O amplification in LSM-based key-value stores

makes it less attractive: Delete and especially update operations that are
important in modern workloads result in frequent and expensive garbage
collection (GC) in the value log. In this paper, we design and implement
Parallax, which proposes hybrid KV placement that reduces GC overhead
significantly and maximizes the benefits of using a log. We first model the
benefits of KV separation for different KV pair sizes. We use this model to
classify KV pairs in three categories small, medium, and large. Then, Parallax
uses different approaches for each KV category: It always places large values
in a log and small values in place. For medium values it uses a mixed strategy
that combines the benefits of using a log and eliminates GC overhead as
follows: It places medium values in a log for all but the last few (typically
one or two) levels in the LSM structure, where it performs a full compaction,
merges values in place, and reclaims log space without the need for GC. We
evaluate Parallax against RocksDB that places all values in place and BlobDB
that always performs KV separation. We find that Parallax increases throughput
by up to 12.4x and 17.83x, decreases I/O amplification by up to 27.1x and 26x,
and increases CPU efficiency by up to 18.7x and 28x respectively, for all but

normal and anomalous images. Although self-supervised representation learning
is commonly used, small dataset sizes limit its effectiveness. It was
previously shown that utilizing external, generic datasets (e.g. ImageNet
classification) can significantly improve anomaly detection performance. One
approach is outlier exposure, which fails when the external datasets do not
resemble the anomalies. We take the approach of transferring representations
pre-trained on external datasets for anomaly detection. Anomaly detection
performance can be significantly improved by fine-tuning the pre-trained
representations on the normal training images. In this paper, we first
demonstrate and analyze that contrastive learning, the most popular
self-supervised learning paradigm cannot be naively applied to pre-trained
features. The reason is that pre-trained feature initialization causes poor
conditioning for standard contrastive objectives, resulting in bad optimization
dynamics. Based on our analysis, we provide a modified contrastive objective,
the Mean-Shifted Contrastive Loss. Our method is highly effective and achieves
a new state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance including $98.6\%$ ROC-AUC

$\lesssim 10\%$ of the expected shot noise for the forthcoming Simons

$\it{Euclid}$-like simulated cosmic shear analysis. For the CMB case,
$\it{CosmoPower}$ is tested on a $\it{Planck}$ 2018 CMB temperature and

rate, which is set by the opacity of its envelope. Accreting dust and pebbles
contribute to the envelope opacity and, thus, influence the outcome of planet
formation. Our aim is to model the size evolution and opacity contribution of
solids inside planetary envelopes. We then use the resultant opacity relations
to study emergent trends in planet formation. We design a model for the opacity
of solids in planetary envelopes that accounts for the growth, fragmentation
and erosion of pebbles during their sedimentation. We formulate analytical
expressions for the opacity of pebbles and dust and map out their trends as a
function of depth, planet mass, distance and accretion rate. We find that the
accretion of pebbles rather than planetesimals can produce fully convective
envelopes, but only in lower-mass planets that reside in the outer disk or in
those that are accreting pebbles at a high rate. In these conditions, pebble
sizes are limited by fragmentation and erosion, allowing them to pile up in the
envelope. At higher planetary masses or reduced accretion rates, a different
regime applies where the sizes of sedimenting pebbles are only limited by their
rate of growth. The opacity in this growth-limited regime is much lower,
steeply declines with depth and planet mass but is invariant with the pebble
mass flux. Our results imply that the opacity of a forming planetary envelope
can not be approximated by a value that is constant with either depth or planet
mass. When applied to the Solar System, we argue that Uranus and Neptune could
not have maintained a sufficiently high opacity to avoid runaway gas accretion
unless they both experienced sufficiently rapid accretion of solids and formed
late.

turbulent cascade is fully developed, the GW spectrum shows a sharp drop for

efficient in driving GWs than previously thought. The peaks of the resulting GW
spectra may well be in the range accessible to space interferometers, pulsar
timing arrays, and other facilities.

likely from fast shocks as it moves through the hot halo associated with a
galaxy over-density around the quasar. N3 is not coincident with any galaxies

as well as a range of configurations that are relevant to binary neutron star
mergers. These include low and high luminosity jets, unmagnetized and mildly
magnetized jets, time-dependent luminosity jets, and Newtonian and relativistic
head velocities. We also extend the existing solution of jets in a static
medium to power-law density media with index $\alpha<5$. Our model provides
simple analytic formulae (calibrated by 3D simulations) for the jet head
propagation and breakout times. We find that the system evolution has two main
regimes: strong and weak jets. Strong jets start their propagation immediately
within the ejecta. Weak jets are unable to penetrate the ejecta at first, and
breach it only after the ejecta expands significantly, thus their evolution is
independent of the delay between the onset of the ejecta and the jet launching.
After enough time, both strong and weak jets approach a common asymptotic
phase. We find that a necessary, but insufficient, criterion for the breakout
of unmagnetized [weakly magnetized] jets is $E_{j,{\rm iso,tot}} \gtrsim

$E_{j,{\rm iso,tot}}$ is the jet total isotropic equivalent energy, $\theta_j$

magnetic fields. We report ALMA 1.2 mm, high-resolution (700 au) dust
polarization and molecular line observations of the rotating hot molecular core
embedded in the high-mass star-forming region IRAS 18089-1732. The dust
continuum emission and magnetic field morphology present spiral-like features
resembling a whirlpool. The velocity field traced by the H13CO+ (J=3-2)
transition line reveals a complex structure with spiral filaments that are
likely infalling and rotating, dragging the field with them. We have modeled
the magnetic field and find that the best model corresponds to a weakly
magnetized core with a mass-to-magnetic-flux ratio (lambda) of 8.38. The
modeled magnetic field is dominated by a poloidal component, but with an
important contribution from the toroidal component that has a magnitude of 30%
of the poloidal component. Using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, we
estimate a magnetic field strength of 3.5 mG. At the spatial scales accessible
to ALMA, an analysis of the energy balance of the system indicates that gravity
overwhelms turbulence, rotation, and the magnetic field. We show that high-mass
star formation can occur in weakly magnetized environments, with gravity taking
the dominant role.

empirical ''Band"" function, namely two power laws smoothly connected. The
typical slope of the low energy (sub-MeV) power law is $\alpha_{B}\simeq -1$.
In a small fraction of long GRBs this power law splits into two components such
that the spectrum presents, in addition to the typical $\sim$ MeV $\nu F_{\nu}$
peak, a break at the order of a few keV or hundreds keV. The typical power law
slopes below and above the break are -0.6 and -1.5 respectively. If the break
is a common feature, the value of $\alpha_{B}$ could be an ''average'' of the
spectral slopes below and above the break in GRBs fitted with Band function. We
analyze the spectra of 27 (9) bright long (short) GRBs detected by the Fermi
satellite finding a low energy break between 80 keV and 280 keV in 12 long
GRBs, but in none of the short events. Through spectral simulations we show
that if the break is moved closer (farther) to the peak energy a relatively
harder (softer) $\alpha_{B}$ is found by fitting the simulated spectra with the
Band function. The hard average slope $\alpha_{B}\simeq-0.38$ found in short
GRBs suggests that the break is close to the peak energy. We show that for 15
long GRBs best fitted by the Band function only, the break could be present,
but it is not identifiable in the Fermi/GBM spectrum, because either at low
energies, close to the detector limit for relatively soft
$\alpha_{B}\lesssim-1$, or in the proximity of the energy peak for relatively
hard $\alpha_{B}\gtrsim-1$. A spectrum with two breaks could be typical of GRB
prompt emission, though hard to identify with current detectors. Instrumental
design such that conceived for the THESEUS space mission, extending from 0.3

and Ohmic dissipation, for as long as the crust is sufficiently strong to
absorb Maxwell stresses exerted by the field and thus make the momentum
equation redundant. For the strongest neutron-star fields, however, stresses
build to the point of crustal failure, at which point the standard evolution
equations are no longer valid. Here, we study the evolution of the magnetic
field of the crust up to and beyond crustal failure, whence the crust begins to
flow plastically. We perform global axisymmetric evolutions, exploring
different types of failure affecting a limited region of the crust. We find
that a plastic flow does not simply suppress the Hall effect even in the regime
of a low plastic viscosity, but it rather leads to non-trivial evolution -- in
some cases even overreacting and enhancing the impact of the Hall effect. Its
impact is more pronouced in the toroidal field, with the differences on the
poloidal field being less substantial. We argue that both the nature of
magnetar bursts and their spindown evolution will be affected by plastic flow,
so that observations of these phenomena may help to constrain the way the crust

uptake as pointwise Jensen-Shannon Divergence (pJSD), estimated via next

of identifying a wider range of uptake phenomena like question answering and
reformulation. We apply our uptake measure to three different educational
datasets with outcome indicators. Unlike baseline measures, pJSD correlates
significantly with instruction quality in all three, providing evidence for its
generalizability and for its potential to serve as an automated professional

were collected and used to model. We started with a COSMOS sample of type-1

points, we cross-matched the COSMOS with the SDSS DR14 quasar catalog, and
eventually, we find 90 sources that have broadband data ranging from IR to soft

Xspec by using the optxagnf and the SKIRTOR models for the X-ray, UV, Optical,

respect to redshift, black hole (BH) mass, and Eddington ratio with an equal

However, optimizing variational quantum algorithms is a challenge as it is an
NP-hard problem that in general requires an exponential time to solve and can
contain many far from optimal local minima. Here, we present a current term
NISQ algorithm for solving SDPs. The classical optimization program of our NISQ
solver is another SDP over a lower dimensional ansatz space. We harness the SDP
based formulation of the Hamiltonian ground state problem to design a NISQ
eigensolver. Unlike variational quantum eigensolvers, the classical
optimization program of our eigensolver is convex, can be solved in polynomial
time with the number of ansatz parameters and every local minimum is a global
minimum. We find numeric evidence that NISQ SDP can improve the estimation of
ground state energies in a scalable manner. Further, we efficiently solve
constrained problems to calculate the excited states of Hamiltonians, find the
lowest energy of symmetry constrained Hamiltonians and determine the optimal
measurements for quantum state discrimination. We demonstrate the potential of
our approach by finding the largest eigenvalue of up to $2^{1000}$ dimensional

availability: where larger datasets exist, they may be single-speaker or have
different domains than desired application scenarios, demanding a need for
domain and speaker-invariant language identification systems. This year's

this scenario: systems were to be trained on largely single-speaker speech from
one domain, but evaluated on data in other domains recorded from speakers under
different recording circumstances, mimicking realistic low-resource scenarios.

gravitationally supercritical within the uncertainty, and most dense cores are
formed in them. We found that dense cores in the hubs show a systemic velocity
shift of ~0.3 km/s between the $\rm N_{2}H^{+}$ and C$^{18}$O gas. Besides,
these cores are subsonic or transonic, while the surrounding filament gas is
transonic or supersonic, indicating that the cores in the hubs are likely
formed by the turbulence dissipation in the colliding turbulent filaments and
the merging is still ongoing. We estimated the mass accretion rate of $15 -
35~M_{\odot}~\rm Myr^{-1}$ from the filaments to the dense cores, and the
required time scales to collect the current core mass are consistent with the
lifetime of the dense cores. The structures of filaments and dense cores in the

these challenges in the physics community ignore the physical symmetries of the
decay products and consider all possible assignment permutations and do not
scale to complex configurations. Attention based deep learning methods for

shortening of the synaptic potentials caused by the $I_{\rm h}$ conductance is
well understood, the role of the $I_{\rm h}$ kinetics remains unclear. Here, we
use a model of the $I_{\rm h}$ current model with either fast or slow kinetics
to determine its influence on the membrane time constant ($\tau_m$) of a CA1
pyramidal cell model. Our simulation results show that the $I_{\rm h}$ with
fast kinetics decreases $\tau_m$ and attenuates and shortens the excitatory
postsynaptic potentials more than the slow $I_{\rm h}$. We conclude that the
$I_{\rm h}$ activation kinetics is able to modulate $\tau_m$ and the temporal
properties of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in CA1 pyramidal
cells. In order to elucidate the mechanisms by which $I_{\rm h}$ kinetics
controls $\tau_m$, we propose a new concept called ""time scaling factor"". Our
main finding is that the $I_{\rm h}$ kinetics influences $\tau_m$ by modulating
the contribution of the $I_{\rm h}$ derivative conductance to $\tau_m$.

has impact on public health planning and disease mitigation. Most existing
epidemic forecasting models disregard uncertainty quantification, resulting in
mis-calibrated predictions. Recent works in deep neural models for
uncertainty-aware time-series forecasting also have several limitations; e.g.
it is difficult to specify meaningful priors in Bayesian NNs, while methods
like deep ensembling are computationally expensive in practice. In this paper,
we fill this important gap. We model the forecasting task as a probabilistic
generative process and propose a functional neural process model called EPIFNP,
which directly models the probability density of the forecast value. EPIFNP
leverages a dynamic stochastic correlation graph to model the correlations
between sequences in a non-parametric way, and designs different stochastic
latent variables to capture functional uncertainty from different perspectives.
Our extensive experiments in a real-time flu forecasting setting show that
EPIFNP significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in both
accuracy and calibration metrics, up to 2.5x in accuracy and 2.4x in
calibration. Additionally, due to properties of its generative process,EPIFNP
learns the relations between the current season and similar patterns of
historical seasons,enabling interpretable forecasts. Beyond epidemic
forecasting, the EPIFNP can be of independent interest for advancing principled
uncertainty quantification in deep sequential models for predictive analytics

offline videos of demonstrations across multiple expert agents, each performing

producing rewards from self-supervised embeddings typically required alignment
with a reference trajectory, which may be difficult to acquire under stark
embodiment differences. We show empirically that if the embeddings are aware of
task progress, simply taking the negative distance between the current state

training policies with reinforcement learning. We find our learned reward

generalizes to entirely new embodiments. Additionally, when transferring

abundances removes the observed age-dependence of log(N/O) and log(C/N), but it
leaves trends of log(N/O) and log(C/N) with metallicity, as expected based on
nucleosynthesis models. The stellar N/O trend agrees well with Dopita et al.'s

substantial separation in birth [N/Mg] ratios between high-[$\alpha$/Fe]

general feature, all conformalons show a gravitational blueshift instead of a
gravitational redshift at the unattainable event horizon, hence avoiding the
Trans-Planckian problem in the Hawking evaporation process. The latter happens
as usual near the event horizon, but now the annihilation process between the
matter and Hawking's negative energy particles takes place outside of the event
horizon. Indeed, in these solutions the gravitational collapse consists of
matter that falls down forever towards the horizon without ever reaching it.

have inherently fine-grained attributes (e.g., bird-species recognition,
medical image classification). In addition to achieving reliable accuracy, a
critical subtask for these models is to detect Out-of-distribution (OOD)
inputs. Given the nature of the deployment environment, one may expect such OOD
inputs to also be fine-grained w.r.t. the known classes (e.g., a novel bird
species), which are thus extremely difficult to identify. Unfortunately, OOD
detection in fine-grained scenarios remains largely underexplored. In this
work, we aim to fill this gap by first carefully constructing four large-scale
fine-grained test environments, in which existing methods are shown to have
difficulties. Particularly, we find that even explicitly incorporating a
diverse set of auxiliary outlier data during training does not provide
sufficient coverage over the broad region where fine-grained OOD samples
locate. We then propose Mixture Outlier Exposure (MixOE), which mixes ID data
and training outliers to expand the coverage of different OOD granularities,
and trains the model such that the prediction confidence linearly decays as the
input transitions from ID to OOD. Extensive experiments and analyses
demonstrate the effectiveness of MixOE for building up OOD detector in

undergo) this cleaning step end up tainting the training data and the model
with no further chance of being cleaned. We propose Cincer, a novel approach
that cleans both new and past data by identifying pairs of mutually
incompatible examples. Whenever it detects a suspicious example, Cincer
identifies a counter-example in the training set that -- according to the model
-- is maximally incompatible with the suspicious example, and asks the
annotator to relabel either or both examples, resolving this possible
inconsistency. The counter-examples are chosen to be maximally incompatible, so
to serve as explanations of the model's suspicion, and highly influential, so
to convey as much information as possible if relabeled. Cincer achieves this by
leveraging an efficient and robust approximation of influence functions based
on the Fisher information matrix (FIM). Our extensive empirical evaluation
shows that clarifying the reasons behind the model's suspicions by cleaning the
counter-examples helps in acquiring substantially better data and models,
especially when paired with our FIM approximation.

we characterize the echo chamber effect by modeling the dynamics of users'

by Twitter produces a significant reduction of questionable content, with a
consequent affiliation towards reliable sources in terms of engagement and
comments. Conversely, the lack of clear regulation on Gab results in the
tendency of the user to engage with both types of content, showing a slight
preference for the questionable ones which may account for a
dissing/endorsement behavior. Twitter users show segregation towards reliable
content with a uniform narrative. Gab, instead, offers a more heterogeneous

applications ranging from being an essential part of scouting programs to
engineering molecular knots. Biomolecular knots, such as knotted proteins, bear
various cellular functions and their entanglement is believed to provide them
with thermal and kinetic stability. Yet, little is known about the design
principles of naturally evolved molecular knots. Intra-chain contacts and chain
entanglement contribute to folding of knotted proteins. Circuit topology, a
theory that describes intra-chain contacts, was recently generalized to account
for chain entanglement. This generalization is unique to circuit topology and
not motivated by other theories. In this paper, we systematically analyze the
circuit topology approach to a description of linear chain entanglement. We
utilize a bottom-up approach, i.e., we express entanglement by a set of 4
fundamental structural units subjected to 3 (or 5) binary topological
operations. All knots found in proteins form a well-defined, distinct group
which naturally appears if expressed in terms of these basic structural units.
Prime knots, which are viewed by knot theory as undecomposable, are also made
of these structural units connected in some specific way. In turn, this kind of
connection shows the fundamental reason why prime knots cannot be decomposed in
the rigorous sense of knot theory. We believe that such a detailed, bottom-up
understanding of the structure of molecular knots should be beneficial for
molecular engineering.

notoriously ignore the notion of rewards, which undermines the general utility
of PSR models for control, planning, or reinforcement learning. Therefore, we
describe a sufficient and necessary accuracy condition which determines whether
a PSR is able to accurately model POMDP rewards, we show that rewards can be
approximated even when the accuracy condition is not satisfied, and we find
that a non-trivial number of POMDPs taken from a well-known third-party
repository do not satisfy the accuracy condition. We propose reward-predictive
state representations (R-PSRs), a generalization of PSRs which accurately
models both observations and rewards, and develop value iteration for R-PSRs.
We show that there is a mismatch between optimal POMDP policies and the optimal
PSR policies derived from approximate rewards. On the other hand, optimal R-PSR
policies perfectly match optimal POMDP policies, reconfirming R-PSRs as
accurate state-less generative models of observations and rewards.

multistability in gene-regulatory circuits. In the induced state of the
lac-pathway, the genes comprising the lac-operon are transcribed, leading to
the production of proteins which import and metabolize lactose. In the
uninduced state, a stable repressor-DNA loop frequently blocks the
transcription of the lac-genes. Transitions from one phenotypic state to the
other are driven by fluctuations, which arise from the random timing of the
binding of ligands and proteins. This stochasticity affects transcription and
translation, and ultimately molecular copy numbers. Our aim is to understand
the transition from the induced to the uninduced state of the lac-operon. We
use a detailed computational model to show that repressor-operator
binding/unbinding, fluctuations in the total number of repressors, and
inducer-repressor binding/unbinding all play a role in this transition. Based
on the timescales on which these processes operate, we construct a minimal
model of the transition to the uninduced state and compare the results with
simulations and experimental observations. The induced state turns out to be
very stable, with a transition rate to the uninduced state lower than $2 \times
10^{-9}$ per minute. In contrast to the transition to the induced state, the
transition to the uninduced state is well described in terms of a 2D diffusive
system crossing a barrier, with the diffusion rates emerging from a model of
repressor unbinding.

morphing actuation on the suction surface of NACA0012 at Re = 1,000. Although
this actuation strategy has been studied at higher Reynolds numbers for an

not yet been investigated. The kinematics of actuation are defined by
wavenumber and wavespeed, both of which are varied over a wide range of values
to include parameters that considerably change the lift dynamics as well as
those that do not. We first study the effect of actuation at an angle of attack
of $\alpha$=5{\deg}, where the unactuated flow is steady. The lift dynamics are
found to align with the surface morphing kinematics, and there is a
low-pressure minimum shown to be introduced into the flow-field by morphing
that advects at a speed agnostic to the morphing parameters. Lift benefits are
found to be maximal when the morphing kinematics align with this intrinsic flow
speed. We then investigate the role of morphing in the presence of an unsteady,
separated baseline flow (with intrinsic vortex-shedding processes) at
$\alpha$=15{\deg}. At this higher angle of attack, we identify three distinct
behavioral regimes based on the relationship between morphing and the
underlying shedding frequency. Of these regimes, the most beneficial to mean
lift is the lock-on regime, where the vortex-shedding dynamics align with the
morphing kinematics. We also identify other regimes where morphing can become
out of phase with the vortex-shedding dynamics, termed here the interactive
regime, and where morphing leaves the unactuated dynamics unaltered, termed
here the superposition regime. At the higher angle of attack, parameters
leading to lift benefits/detriments are explained in terms of the effect of
morphing on the leading and trailing-edge vortex.

molecular dynamics simulations of the realistic TIP4P/2005 model, we found a
striking signature of the liquid-liquid critical point in the structure of
water glasses, manifested as a pronounced increase in long-range density
fluctuations at pressures proximate to the critical pressure. By contrast,
these signatures were absent in glasses of two model systems that lack a
critical point. We also characterized the departure from equilibrium upon
vitrification via the non-equilibrium index; water-like systems exhibited a
strong pressure dependence in this metric, whereas simple liquids did not.

negligible within the sensitivity $S_V=9\times

typical for advanced trap designs. Furthermore, we investigate the frequency
and temperature dependence of electric field noise above a YBCO surface. We
find a $1/f$ spectral dependence of the noise and a non-trivial temperature
dependence, with a plateau in the noise stretching over roughly
$60\,\mathrm{K}$. The onset of the plateau coincides with the superconducting
transition, indicating a connection between the dominant noise and the YBCO
trap material. We exclude the YBCO bulk as origin of the noise and suggest
further experiments to decide between the two remaining options explaining the
observed temperature dependence: noise screening within the superconducting
phase, or surface noise activated by the YBCO bulk through some unknown
mechanism.

very high energy sky in the 300 GeV to $>100$ TeV energy range. HAWC has
detected two blazars above $11\sigma$, Markarian 421 (Mrk 421) and Markarian
501 (Mrk 501). The observations are comprised of data taken in the period
between June 2015 and July 2018, resulting in a $\sim 1038$ days of exposure.
In this work we report the time-averaged spectral analysis for both sources
above 0.5 TeV. Taking into account the flux attenuation due to the
extragalactic background light (EBL), the intrinsic spectrum of Mrk 421 is
described by a power law with an exponential energy cut-off with index
$\alpha=2.26\pm(0.12)_{stat}(_{-0.2}^{+0.17})_{sys}$ and energy cut-off
$E_c=5.1\pm(1.6)_{stat}(_{-2.5}^{+1.4})_{sys}$ TeV, while the intrinsic
spectrum of Mrk 501 is better described by a simple power law with index
$\alpha=2.61\pm(0.11)_{stat}(_{-0.07}^{+0.01})_{sys}$. The maximum energies at
which the Mrk 421 and Mrk 501 signals are detected are 9 and 12 TeV,
respectively. This makes these some of the highest energy detections to date
for spectra averaged over years-long timescales. Since the observation of gamma
radiation from blazars provides information about the physical processes that
take place in their relativistic jets, it is important to study the broad-band
spectral energy distribution (SED) of these objects. To this purpose,
contemporaneous data in the gamma-ray band to X-ray range, and literature data
in the radio to UV range, were used to build time-averaged SEDs that were
modeled within a synchrotron self-Compton leptonic scenario.

TENGraD, with linear convergence guarantees. Computing the inverse of the
neural network's Fisher information matrix is expensive in NGD because the

NGD's running time and practical application by reducing the Fisher matrix
inversion cost with approximation. However, the approximations do not reduce
the overall time significantly and lead to less accurate parameter updates and
loss of curvature information. TENGraD improves the time efficiency of NGD by
computing Fisher block inverses with a computationally efficient covariance
factorization and reuse method. It computes the inverse of each block exactly
using the Woodbury matrix identity to preserve curvature information while
admitting (linear) fast convergence rates. Our experiments on image

have been released faster than the capacity of processing them. In this
context, the problem of Algorithm Recommendation (AR) is receiving a
significant deal of attention recently. This problem has been addressed in the
literature as a learning task, often as a Meta-Learning problem where the aim
is to recommend the best alternative for a specific dataset. For such, datasets
encoded by meta-features are explored by ML algorithms that try to learn the
mapping between meta-representations and the best technique to be used. One of
the challenges for the successful use of ML is to define which features are the
most valuable for a specific dataset since several meta-features can be used,
which increases the meta-feature dimension. This paper presents an empirical
analysis of Feature Selection and Feature Extraction in the meta-level for the
AR problem. The present study was focused on three criteria: predictive
performance, dimensionality reduction, and pipeline runtime. As we verified,
applying Dimensionality Reduction (DR) methods did not improve predictive
performances in general. However, DR solutions reduced about 80% of the
meta-features, obtaining pretty much the same performance as the original setup
but with lower runtimes. The only exception was PCA, which presented about the
same runtime as the original meta-features. Experimental results also showed
that various datasets have many non-informative meta-features and that it is
possible to obtain high predictive performance using around 20% of the original
meta-features. Therefore, due to their natural trend for high dimensionality,
DR methods should be used for Meta-Feature Selection and Meta-Feature
Extraction.

promise for low web-resource languages (LRL) as multilingual models can enable
transfer of supervision from high resource languages to LRLs. However,
incorporating a new language in an LM still remains a challenge, particularly
for languages with limited corpora and in unseen scripts. In this paper we
argue that relatedness among languages in a language family may be exploited to
overcome some of the corpora limitations of LRLs, and propose RelateLM. We
focus on Indian languages, and exploit relatedness along two dimensions: (1)
script (since many Indic scripts originated from the Brahmic script), and (2)
sentence structure. RelateLM uses transliteration to convert the unseen script
of limited LRL text into the script of a Related Prominent Language (RPL)
(Hindi in our case). While exploiting similar sentence structures, RelateLM
utilizes readily available bilingual dictionaries to pseudo translate RPL text
into LRL corpora. Experiments on multiple real-world benchmark datasets provide
validation to our hypothesis that using a related language as pivot, along with
transliteration and pseudo translation based data augmentation, can be an
effective way to adapt LMs for LRLs, rather than direct training or pivoting

gap, this paper introduces two types of invertible attention mechanisms, i.e.,
map-based and transformer-based attentions, for both unconditional and
conditional generative flows. The key idea is to exploit a masked scheme of
these two attentions to learn long-range data dependencies in the context of
generative flows. The masked scheme allows for invertible attention modules
with tractable Jacobian determinants, enabling its seamless integration at any
positions of the flow-based models. The proposed attention mechanisms lead to
more efficient generative flows, due to their capability of modeling the
long-term data dependencies. Evaluation on multiple image synthesis tasks shows
that the proposed attention flows result in efficient models and compare
favorably against the state-of-the-art unconditional and conditional generative

channel of $T/Y \rightarrow Wb$ decay mode. The hadronic channel is not a clean
channel, unlike the leptonic channel, because of the contribution coming from
the QCD processes, which accounts for a significant background. The modelling
of QCD processes is challenging due to their theoretical prediction and
experimental challenges. Due to this, it is observed that the Monte Carlo
simulation of the QCD multijet is mismodelled in this analysis. In this thesis,
a data-driven method called the ABCD method is presented to estimate the QCD
multijet background. The method uses the background events from all the control
regions to estimate the multijets in the signal region. However, a correlation
among different control regions is observed, which is further accounted by
introducing a correlation factor. The correlation factor is calculated by
performing likelihood fit to the MC simulated backgrounds. Some additional
studies, including uncertainty estimation on the method and the performance of
the method with different jet collections and taggers, are also performed.

Our approach is model agnostic and black box. Furthermore, the calculation of

characteristics, our approach admits optional desiderata such as adherence to
the data manifold, respect for causal relations, and sparsity -- identified by
past research as desirable properties of ARs. We evaluate our approach using
three real-world datasets and show successful generation of sequential ARs that

those results demonstrated that it is possible to learn a useful model even

the maximum strength of interactions and thus does not achieve the

carefully combines elements of the Chow-Liu algorithm with tree metric
reconstruction methods to efficiently and optimally learn tree Ising models

misspecification and adversarial corruptions. In contrast, we show that the

Successive batch normalizations with random linear transformations make hidden
representations increasingly orthogonal across layers of a deep neural network.
We establish a non-asymptotic characterization of the interplay between depth,
width, and the orthogonality of deep representations. More precisely, under a
mild assumption, we prove that the deviation of the representations from
orthogonality rapidly decays with depth up to a term inversely proportional to
the network width. This result has two main implications: 1) Theoretically, as
the depth grows, the distribution of the representation -- after the linear
layers -- contracts to a Wasserstein-2 ball around an isotropic Gaussian
distribution. Furthermore, the radius of this Wasserstein ball shrinks with the
width of the network. 2) In practice, the orthogonality of the representations
directly influences the performance of stochastic gradient descent (SGD). When
representations are initially aligned, we observe SGD wastes many iterations to
orthogonalize representations before the classification. Nevertheless, we
experimentally show that starting optimization from orthogonal representations
is sufficient to accelerate SGD, with no need for BN.

create small-amplitude, very-low frequency motions (on the order of the
rotation rate and lower), which in turn shift the resonant frequencies and
eigenfunctions of the acoustic modes of the Sun. The detection of even
azimuthal orders Rossby modes using mode coupling presents additional
challenges and prior work therefore only focused on odd orders. Here, we
successfully extend the methodology to measure even azimuthal orders as well.
We analyze 4 and 8 years of Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) data and
consider coupling between different-degree acoustic modes (of separations 1 and
3 in harmonic degree). The technique uses couplings between different frequency
bins to capture the temporal variability of the Rossby modes. We observe
significant power close to the theoretical dispersion relation for sectoral
Rossby modes (where the azimuthal order is same as harmonic degree, s = |t|).
Our results are consistent with prior measurements of Rossby modes with
azimuthal orders over the range t = 4 to 16 with maximum power occurring at
mode t = 8. The amplitudes of these modes vary from 1 to 2 m/s. We place an
upper bound of 0.2 m/s on the sectoral t = 2 mode, which we do not detect in

across settlements and distances. For decades, spatial diffusion has been
argued to take place along the urban hierarchy such that the innovation first
spreads from large to medium cities then later from medium to small cities.
Yet, the role of geographical distance, the other major factor of spatial
diffusion, was difficult to identify in hierarchical diffusion due to missing
data on spreading events. In this paper, we exploit spatial patterns of
individual invitations on a social media platform sent from registered users to
new users over the entire life cycle of the platform. This enables us to
disentangle the role of urban hierarchy and the role of distance by observing
the source and target locations of flows over an unprecedented timescale. We
demonstrate that hierarchical diffusion greatly overlaps with diffusion to
close distances and these factors co-evolve over the life cycle; thus, their
joint analysis is necessary. Then, a regression framework is applied to
estimate the number of invitations sent between pairs of towns by years in the
life cycle with the population sizes of the source and target towns, their
combinations, and the distance between them. We confirm that hierarchical
diffusion prevails initially across large towns only but emerges in the full
spectrum of settlements in the middle of the life cycle when adoption
accelerates. Unlike in previous gravity estimations, we find that after an
intensifying role of distance in the middle of the life cycle a surprisingly
weak distance effect characterizes the last years of diffusion. Our results
stress the dominance of urban hierarchy in spatial diffusion and inform future
predictions of innovation adoption at local scales.

swimming animals and robots, but can only be accomplished through indirect
measurements and active control. Recent work with tethered flying insects
indicates that their sensory representation of orientation, apparent flow,
direction of movement, and control is represented by a 2-dimensional angular
encoding in the central brain. This representation simplifies sensory
integration by projecting the direction (but not scale) of measurements with
different units onto a universal polar coordinate frame. To align these angular
measurements with one another and the motor system does, however, require a
calibration of angular gain and offset for each sensor. This calibration could
change with time due to changes in the environment or physical structure. The
circumstances under which small robots and animals with angular sensors and
changing calibrations could self-calibrate and estimate the direction of
ambient fluid flow while moving remains an open question. Here, a methodical
nonlinear observability analysis is presented to address this. The analysis
shows that it is mathematically feasible to continuously estimate flow
direction and perform regular self-calibrations by adopting frequent changes in
course (or active prevention thereof) and orientation, and requires fusion and
temporal differentiation of three sensory measurements: apparent flow,
orientation (or its derivative), and direction of motion (or its derivative).
These conclusions are consistent with the zigzagging trajectories exhibited by
many plume tracking organisms, suggesting that perhaps flow estimation is a
secondary driver of their trajectory structure.

scientific exploitation of LISA, as it reduces the otherwise overwhelming laser
noise in the interferometric measurements. The fundamental idea is to define
new laser-noise-free observables by combining appropriately time-shifted
measurements. First- and second-generation TDI combinations cancel laser noise
under the assumption that the LISA armlengths are constant or evolve linearly
with time, respectively. We recently extended TDI by solving for the
laser-noise-free combinations implicitly, writing the likelihood of the data
directly in terms of the basic measurements, and using a discretized
representation of the delays that can accommodate any time dependence of the
armlengths. We named the resulting formalism ""TDI-infinity'' [PRD 103, 082001
(2021)].
  According to Tinto, Dhurandhar, and Joshi [arXiv/2105.02054], our
matrix-based approach is invalidated by the simplified start-up conditions
assumed for the design matrix that connects the time series of laser-noise
fluctuations to the time series of interferometric measurements along the LISA
arms. Here we respond that, if those boundary conditions are indeed
unrealistic, they do not invalidate the algorithm, since one can simply
truncate the design matrix to exclude ""incomplete'' measurements, or set them
to zero. Our formalism then proceeds unmodified, except that the length of the
laser-noise canceling time series is reduced by the number of excluded
measurements. Tinto and colleagues further claim that the matrix formulation is
merely a finite representation of the polynomial ring of delay operators
introduced by Dhurandar, Nayak, and Vinet to formalize TDI. We show that this
is only true if all interferometric delays are exact multiples of the sampling
interval, which will not be possible in practical contexts such as LISA.

a curious form of entanglement that can also not be distilled into maximally
(free) entangled states. Only a few bound entangled states have been found,
typically by constructing dedicated entanglement witnesses, so naturally the
question arises how large is the volume of those states. We define a large
family of magically symmetric states of bipartite qutrits for which we find
$82\%$ to be free entangled, $2\%$ to be certainly separable and as much as
$10\%$ to be bound entangled, which shows that this kind of entanglement is not
rare. Via various machine learning algorithms we can confirm that the remaining
$6\%$ of states are more likely to belonging to the set of separable states
than bound entangled states. Most important we find via dimension reduction
algorithms that there is a strong $2$-dimensional (linear) sub-structure in the

find and characterize bound entanglement towards solving the long-standing

at high energies is suppressed and the resonant states induced by impurities in
the vicinity of the Dirac point gradually disappear. It is found that
nonmagnetic impurities break electron-hole symmetry at low warping strength,
while the symmetry remains unchanged when the surface is magnetically doped.
Our findings reveal that surface conductivity can be controlled by tuning the

(TBL) is challenging, therefore requiring it to be indirectly determined from
mean profile measurements. Most popular methods assume the mean streamwise
velocity to satisfy either a logarithmic law in the inner layer or a composite
velocity profile with many tuned constants for the entire TBL, both of which
require reliable data from the inner layer. The presence of roughness and
pressure gradient brings additional complications where most existing methods
either fail or require significant modification. A novel method is proposed to
determine the wall shear stress in zero pressure gradient TBL from measured
mean profiles, without requiring near-wall data. The method is based on the
stress model of Kumar and Mahesh [Phys. Rev. Fluids 6, 024603 (2021)], who
developed accurate models for mean stress and wall-normal velocity in zero
pressure gradient TBL. The proposed method requires a single point measurement
of mean streamwise velocity and mean shear stress in the outer layer,
preferably between $20$ to $50 \%$ of the TBL, and an estimate of boundary
layer thickness and shape factor. The method can handle wall roughness without
modification and is shown to predict friction velocities to within $3 \%$ over
a range of Reynolds number for both smooth and rough wall zero pressure
gradient TBL. In order to include the pressure gradients effects, the work of
Kumar and Mahesh [Phys. Rev. Fluids 6, 024603 (2021)] is revisited to derive a
novel model for both mean stress and wall-normal velocity in pressure gradient
TBL, which is then used to formulate a method to obtain the wall shear stress
from the profile data. Overall, the proposed method is shown to be robust and
accurate for a variety of pressure gradient TBL.

investigate the cross-lingual transfer abilities of XLM-R for Chinese and
English natural language inference (NLI), with a focus on the recent
large-scale Chinese dataset OCNLI. To better understand linguistic transfer, we
created 4 categories of challenge and adversarial tasks (totaling 17 new
datasets) for Chinese that build on several well-known resources for English
(e.g., HANS, NLI stress-tests). We find that cross-lingual models trained on
English NLI do transfer well across our Chinese tasks (e.g., in 3/4 of our
challenge categories, they perform as well/better than the best monolingual
models, even on 3/5 uniquely Chinese linguistic phenomena such as idioms, pro

models often perform best when trained on a mixture of English and high-quality
monolingual NLI data (OCNLI), and are often hindered by automatically
translated resources (XNLI-zh). For many phenomena, all models continue to
struggle, highlighting the need for our new diagnostics to help benchmark

method permits fast and accurate numerical solutions of the field-aligned
hydrodynamic equations, successfully removing the influence of numerical
resolution on the coronal density response to impulsive heating. This is
achieved by adjusting the parallel thermal conductivity, radiative loss, and
heating rates to broaden the transition region (TR), below a global cutoff
temperature, so that the steep gradients are spatially resolved even when using
coarse numerical grids. Implementing the original 1D formulation of TRAC in
multi-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models would require tracing a
large number of magnetic field lines at every time step in order to prescribe a
global cutoff temperature to each field line. In this paper, we present a
highly efficient formulation of the TRAC method for use in multi-dimensional
MHD simulations, which does not rely on field line tracing. In the TR, adaptive
local cutoff temperatures are used instead of global cutoff temperatures to
broaden any unresolved parts of the atmosphere. These local cutoff temperatures
are calculated using only local grid cell quantities, enabling the MHD
extension of TRAC to efficiently account for the magnetic field evolution,
without tracing field lines. Consistent with analytical predictions, we show
that this approach successfully preserves the properties of the original TRAC
method. In particular, the total radiative losses and heating remain conserved
under the MHD formulation. Results from 2D MHD simulations of impulsive heating
in unsheared and sheared arcades of coronal loops are also presented. These
simulations benchmark the MHD TRAC method against a series of 1D models and

simulation with any computer. Some of these results even impact our
understanding of chemistry in the real world. In this perspective, we take the
position that direct chemical simulation is best understood as a digital
experiment. While on one hand this clarifies the power of quantum computers to
extend our reach, it also shows us the limitations of taking such an approach
too directly. Leveraging results that quantum computers cannot outpace the
physical world, we build to the controversial stance that some chemical
problems are best viewed as problems for which no algorithm can deliver their
solution in general, known in computer science as undecidable problems. This
has implications for the predictive power of thermodynamic models and topics
like the ergodic hypothesis. However, we argue that this perspective is not
defeatist, but rather helps shed light on the success of existing chemical
models like transition state theory, molecular orbital theory, and
thermodynamics as models that benefit from data. We contextualize recent
results showing that data-augmented models are more powerful rote simulation.
These results help us appreciate the success of traditional chemical theory and
anticipate new models learned from experimental data. Not only can quantum
computers provide data for such models, but they can extend the class and power
of models that utilize data in fundamental ways. These discussions culminate in

optimization on server-based system architecture. In this problem, each agent
has a local cost, and the goal for the agents is to collectively find a minimum
of their aggregate cost. A standard algorithm to solve this problem is the
iterative distributed gradient-descent (DGD) method being implemented
collaboratively by the server and the agents. In the synchronous setting, the
algorithm proceeds from one iteration to the next only after all the agents
complete their expected communication with the server. However, such synchrony
can be expensive and even infeasible in real-world applications. We show that
waiting for all the agents is unnecessary in many applications of distributed
optimization, including distributed machine learning, due to redundancy in the
cost functions (or {\em data}). Specifically, we consider a generic notion of
redundancy named $(r,\epsilon)$-redundancy implying solvability of the original
multi-agent optimization problem with $\epsilon$ accuracy, despite the removal
of up to $r$ (out of total $n$) agents from the system. We present an
asynchronous DGD algorithm where in each iteration the server only waits for
(any) $n-r$ agents, instead of all the $n$ agents. Assuming
$(r,\epsilon)$-redundancy, we show that our asynchronous algorithm converges to
an approximate solution with error that is linear in $\epsilon$ and $r$.
Moreover, we also present a generalization of our algorithm to tolerate some
Byzantine faulty agents in the system. Finally, we demonstrate the improved
communication efficiency of our algorithm through experiments on MNIST and
Fashion-MNIST using the benchmark neural network LeNet.

within the mantle, where one ocean is the mass of water on the Earth's surface
today. With $n$-body simulations we consider how much water could have been
delivered from the asteroid belt to the Earth after its formation. Asteroids
are delivered from unstable regions near resonances with the giant planets. We
compare the relative impact efficiencies from the $\nu_6$ resonance, the 2:1
mean motion resonance with Jupiter and the outer asteroid belt. The $\nu_6$
resonance provides the largest supply of asteroids to the Earth, with about
$2\%$ of asteroids from that region colliding with the Earth. Asteroids located
in mean motion resonances with Jupiter and in the outer asteroid belt have
negligible Earth-collision probabilities. The maximum number of Earth
collisions occurs if the asteroids in the primordial asteroid belt are first
moved into the $\nu_6$ resonance location (through asteroid-asteroid
interactions or otherwise) before their eccentricity is excited sufficiently
for Earth collision. A maximum of about eight oceans of water may be delivered
to the Earth. Thus, if the Earth contains ten or more oceans of water, the
Earth likely formed with a significant fraction of this water.

Specifically, we propose a hierarchical motion variational autoencoder (HM-VAE)

  Science and Machine Learning","Submitted",,,,"q-bio.MN","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We explored the dynamical and structural effects of actin-related proteins
2/3 (Arp2/3) on actomyosin networks using mechanochemical simulations of active
matter networks. At a nanoscale, the Arp2/3 complex alters the topology of
actomyosin by nucleating a daughter filament at an angle to a mother filament.
At a subcellular scale, they orchestrate the formation of branched actomyosin
network. Using a coarse-grained approach, we sought to understand how an
actomyosin network temporally and spatially reorganizes itself by varying the
concentration of the Arp2/3 complexes. Driven by the motor dynamics, the
network stalls at a high concentration of Arp2/3 and contracts at a low Arp2/3
concentration. At an intermediate Arp2/3 concentration, however, the actomyosin
network is formed by loosely connected clusters that may collapse suddenly when
driven by motors. This physical phenomenon is called an ""avalanche"" largely due
to the marginal instability inherent from the morphology of a branched
actomyosin network when the Arp2/3 complex is present. While embracing the data
science approaches, we unveiled the higher-order patterns in the branched
actomyosin networks and discovered a sudden change in the ""social"" network
topology of the actomyosin. This is a new type of avalanches in addition to the
two types of avalanches associated with a sudden change in the size or the
shape of the whole actomyosin network as shown in the previous investigation.
Our new finding promotes the importance of using network theory and machine
learning models to forecast avalanches in actomyosin networks. The mechanisms
of the Arp2/3 complexes in shaping the architecture of branched actomyosin
networks obtained in this paper will help us better understand the emergent
reorganization of the topology in dense actomyosin networks that are difficult
to detect in experiments.

paper, we describe our pedagogical approach to increasing access to applied ML

We suggest that TinyML, ML on resource-constrained embedded devices, is an
attractive means to widen access because TinyML both leverages low-cost and
globally accessible hardware, and encourages the development of complete,
self-contained applications, from data collection to deployment. To this end, a
collaboration between academia (Harvard University) and industry (Google)
produced a four-part MOOC that provides application-oriented instruction on how
to develop solutions using TinyML. The series is openly available on the edX
MOOC platform, has no prerequisites beyond basic programming, and is designed
for learners from a global variety of backgrounds. It introduces pupils to
real-world applications, ML algorithms, data-set engineering, and the ethical
considerations of these technologies via hands-on programming and deployment of
TinyML applications in both the cloud and their own microcontrollers. To
facilitate continued learning, community building, and collaboration beyond the

building efficient and generalizable machine learning models. In practice, the
most common way to learn invariance is through data augmentation. There has
been recent interest in the development of methods that learn distributions on
augmentation transformations from the training data itself. While such
approaches are beneficial since they are responsive to the data, they ignore
the fact that in many situations the range of transformations to which a model
needs to be invariant changes depending on the particular class input belongs
to. For example, if a model needs to be able to predict whether an image
contains a starfish or a dog, we may want to apply random rotations to starfish
images during training (since these do not have a preferred orientation), but
we would not want to do this to images of dogs. In this work we introduce a
method by which we can learn class conditional distributions on augmentation
transformations. We give a number of examples where our methods learn different
non-meaningful transformations depending on class and further show how our
method can be used as a tool to probe the symmetries intrinsic to a potentially

strong ranking correlation especially compared to recently proposed zero-cost

processes in the infinite-width limit. However, for fully connected networks,
it has been previously shown that for any fixed network width, $n$, the
Gaussian approximation gets worse as the network depth, $d$, increases. Given
that modern networks are deep, this raises the question of how well modern
architectures, like ResNets, are captured by the infinite-width limit. To
provide a better approximation, we study ReLU ResNets in the
infinite-depth-and-width limit, where both depth and width tend to infinity as
their ratio, $d/n$, remains constant. In contrast to the Gaussian
infinite-width limit, we show theoretically that the network exhibits
log-Gaussian behaviour at initialization in the infinite-depth-and-width limit,
with parameters depending on the ratio $d/n$. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we
demonstrate that even basic properties of standard ResNet architectures are
poorly captured by the Gaussian limit, but remarkably well captured by our
log-Gaussian limit. Moreover, our analysis reveals that ReLU ResNets at
initialization are hypoactivated: fewer than half of the ReLUs are activated.
Additionally, we calculate the interlayer correlations, which have the effect
of exponentially increasing the variance of the network output. Based on our
analysis, we introduce Balanced ResNets, a simple architecture modification,
which eliminates hypoactivation and interlayer correlations and is more
amenable to theoretical analysis.

between Cu and O orbitals is comparable to the weight of the spin excitations
between two Cu orbitals. This finding elucidates the microscopic nature of the
spin excitations in the 1D cuprates and sheds light on the spin properties of
other oxides. Importantly, we find a particle-hole asymmetry in the
orbital-resolved charge excitations, which cannot be described by the
singleband Hubbard model and is relevant to resonant inelastic x-ray scattering

unlikely that every agent in a multi-agent system will have local information

This paper focuses on understanding the impact that inconsistencies in agents'

specifically, we consider the design of multi-agent operations under a game
theoretic lens where individual agents are assigned utilities that guide their
local decision making. We provide a tractable procedure for designing utilities
that optimize the efficiency of the resulting collective behavior (i.e., price
of anarchy) for classes of set covering games where the extent of the
information inconsistencies is known. In the setting where the extent of the
informational inconsistencies is not known, we show -- perhaps surprisingly --
that underestimating the level of uncertainty leads to better price of anarchy

classical-electrodynamics approach, it has been reported that the linear
momentum transfer from a STEM-beam electron to a metallic spherical
nanoparticle can be either repulsive or attractive towards the swift electron
trajectory. This is in qualitative agreement with experimental observations.
The interaction time between a swift electron and a nanoparticle is typically
on the order of attoseconds. Hence, the electromagnetic response of the
nanoparticle at short times is of utmost importance. However, it has been
reported that the dielectric function employed in previous studies presented a
non-causal pre-echo at the attosecond timescale, which might have lead to
incorrect unphysical results. Therefore, the validity of these linear momentum
transfer results should be revisited. In this theoretical work, we study the
non-causality effects on the linear momentum transferred from a swift electron
to a metallic nanoparticle, made of either aluminum or gold. Using an efficient
numerical methodology, we found that non-causality, as well as deficient
numerical convergence, may lead to incorrect repulsive linear momentum transfer
results. Contrary to what previous theoretical studies have reported, our
results show that the linear momentum transfer from a swift electron to
spherical aluminum and gold nanoparticles, with radius 1 nm, is always

D-instantons, we study the three-dimensional Yang-Mills Chern-Simons theory in
holography. Due to the presence of the D-instantons, the D7-branes with
discrepant embedding functions are able to be introduced in order to include
the fundamental fermions (as flavors) and the Chern-Simons term (at very low
energy) in the dual theory. The vacuum structure at zero temperature is studied
in the soliton background and it illustrates the topological phase transition
in the presence of instantons. Moreover, since the confinement/deconfinement
phase transition could be holographically identified as the Hawking-Page
transition in the bulk, we accordingly calculate the critical temperature of
the deconfinement phase transition by collecting the bulk onshell action as the
thermodynamical free energy. On the other hand, we evaluate the difference of
the entanglement entropy in slab configuration by using the RT formula since
the confinement may also be characterized by the entanglement entropy.
Altogether we find the behavior of the critical temperature is in qualitative
agreement with the behavior of the critical length determined by the
entanglement entropy which implies the entanglement entropy could indeed be a
character of the confinement in our setup and the D3-D(-1) system would be a
remarkable approach to study the three-dimensional gauge theory.

determinants with some imposed constraints to preserve symmetries of the exact
problem may lead to physically unreasonable potential energy surfaces. On the
other hand, lifting these constraints leads to the so-called broken symmetry
solutions that usually provide better energetics, at the cost of losing
information about good quantum numbers that describe the state of the system.
This behavior has been previously extensively studied in the context of bond
dissociation. This paper studies the behavior of different classes of
Hartree-Fock spin polarized solutions (restricted, unrestricted, generalized)
in the context of ionization by strong static electric fields. We find that,
for simple two-electron systems, UHF is able to provide a qualitatively good
description of states involved during the ionization process (neutral,
singly-ionized and doubly ionized states), whereas RHF fails to describe the
singly ionized state. For more complex systems, even though UHF is able to
capture some of the expected characteristics of the ionized states, it is
constrained to a single $M_s$ (diabatic) manifold in the energy surface as a
function of field intensity. In this case a better qualitative picture can be
painted by GHF as it is able to explore different spin manifolds and follow the
lowest solution due to lack of collinearity constraints on the spin
quantization axis.

exist in such hot accretion flows. The wind is of special interest not only
because it is an indispensable ingredient of accretion, but perhaps more
importantly, it is believed to play a crucial role in the evolution of the host
galaxy via the so-called kinetic mode AGN feedback. Observational evidence for
this wind, however, remains scarce and indirect. Here we report the detection
of a hot outflow from the low-luminosity active galactic nucleus in M81, based
on {\it Chandra} high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy. The outflow is evidenced
by a pair of Fe XXVI Ly$\alpha$ lines redshifted and blueshifted at a bulk
line-of-sight velocity of $\pm2.8\times10^3 \rm~km~s^{-1}$ and a high Fe XXVI
Ly$\alpha$-to-Fe XXV K$\alpha$ line ratio implying a plasma temperature of

stellar activity or the accretion inflow onto the SMBH. Our
magnetohydrodynamical simulations show, instead, it is naturally explained by a
wind from the hot accretion flow, propagating out to $\gtrsim10^6$ times the

However, the hardware cost and power consumption grow significantly as the
number of radio frequency (RF) components increases, which hampers the
deployment of practical massive MIMO systems. To address this issue and further
facilitate the commercialization of massive MIMO, mixed analog-to-digital
converters (ADCs) architecture has been considered, where parts of
conventionally assumed full-resolution ADCs are replaced by one-bit ADCs. In
this paper, we first propose a deep learning-based (DL) joint pilot design and
channel estimation method for mixed-ADCs mmWave massive MIMO. Specifically, we
devise a pilot design neural network whose weights directly represent the
optimized pilots, and develop a Runge-Kutta model-driven densely connected
network as the channel estimator. Instead of randomly assigning the mixed-ADCs,
we then design a novel antenna selection network for mixed-ADCs allocation to
further improve the channel estimation accuracy. Moreover, we adopt an
autoencoder-inspired end-to-end architecture to jointly optimize the pilot
design, channel estimation and mixed-ADCs allocation networks. Simulation
results show that the proposed DL-based methods have advantages over the
traditional channel estimators as well as the state-of-the-art networks.

orofacial harmonization as a dental specialty, and the advent of various uses
of facial fillers, such as hyaluronic acid (HA), it is possible to perform both
esthetic and functional corrections in individuals. Individuals with cleft lip
and palate (CLP) present lip irregularities even after orofacial rehabilitation
with an interdisciplinary team with several corrective surgeries, interfering
with the esthetics, which can cause problems in self-esteem and social
insertion. Thus, facial filling is an innovation that, together with dentistry,
contributes to the individual's esthetics and well-being. Considering the
patient safety and health, more research is progressively being conducted to
make such procedures less invasive. This work conducted a literature review on
the use of HA as a facial filler to correct lip scars in patients with CLP. By
a literature and transverse search in Scientific Electronic Library Online and
PubMed databases using specific descriptors, the studies that met the inclusion
criteria were selected, from 1990 to 2020. It can be concluded that the use of
HA as a facial filling material in the correction of lip scars from reparative

facial asymmetry and to improve the quality of life of patients who used the

tension. In addition, an elastodynamic ""tight binding"" model was proposed to
investigate the formation and evolution of the band structure. The elastic
waves were found to propagate largely under ""easy"" modes in the pre-stretched
soft lattice, and finite stretch tuned the symmetry of the band structure, but
also ""purify"" the propagation modes. Moreover, the uniaxial stretch exhibits
the opposite impacts on the two ""easy"" modes. The effect of the biaxial stretch
was equated with the superposition of the uniaxial stretches in the

attributed to the competition between the effective shear moduli and lengths
for different beam components. Next, the finite stretch could tune the
directional bandgap of the soft lattice, and the broadest elastic wave bandgaps
could be anticipated in an equi-biaxial stretch. In this study, an avenue was
opened to design and implement elastic wave control devices with weight
efficiency and tunability. Furthermore, the differences between the physical

learn hierarchical scene representation. By imposing semantic rules on the
properties of nodes and edges in the tree structure, explicit knowledge
integration enables controllable generation. We construct a synthetic example

vehicles: our method efficiently identifies adversarial driving scenes against
different state-of-the-art 3D point cloud segmentation models and satisfies the

transform and the convolutional transform to improve the decoding performance
of the finite-length polar codes, where the rate-profile is used to construct
the PAC codes by setting the positions of frozen bits. However, the optimal
rateprofile method of PAC codes is still unknown. In this paper, an optimized
rate-profile algorithm of PAC codes is proposed. First, we propose the
normalized compression factor (NCF) to quantify the transmission efficiency of
useful information, showing that the distribution of useful information that
needs to be transmitted after the convolutional transform should be adaptive to
the capacity profile after finite-length polar transform. This phenomenon
indicates that the PAC code improves the transmission efficiency of useful
information, which leads to a better decoding performance than the polar codes
with the same length. Then, we propose a novel rate-profile method of PAC
codes, where a quadratic optimization model is established and the Euclidean
norm of the NCF spectrum is adopted to construct the objective function.
Finally, a heuristic bit-swapping strategy is designed to search for the frozen
set with high objective function values, where the search space is limited by
considering the only bits with medium Hamming weight of the row index.
Simulation results show that the PAC codes with the proposed optimized
rate-profile construction have better decoding performance than the PAC codes
with the originally proposed Reed-Muller design construction.

has been thoroughly investigated in both academic research and industrial
practice. However, existing work typically assume competitors do not change
their bids, i.e., the wining price is fixed, leading to poor performance of the
derived solution. Although a few studies use multi-agent reinforcement learning
to set up a cooperative game, they still suffer the following drawbacks: (1)
They fail to avoid collusion solutions where all the advertisers involved in an
auction collude to bid an extremely low price on purpose. (2) Previous works
cannot well handle the underlying complex bidding environment, leading to poor
model convergence. This problem could be amplified when handling multiple
objectives of advertisers which are practical demands but not considered by
previous work. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-objective cooperative
bid optimization formulation called Multi-Agent Cooperative bidding Games
(MACG). MACG sets up a carefully designed multi-objective optimization
framework where different objectives of advertisers are incorporated. A global
objective to maximize the overall profit of all advertisements is added in
order to encourage better cooperation and also to protect self-bidding
advertisers. To avoid collusion, we also introduce an extra platform revenue
constraint. We analyze the optimal functional form of the bidding formula
theoretically and design a policy network accordingly to generate auction-level
bids. Then we design an efficient multi-agent evolutionary strategy for model
optimization. Offline experiments and online A/B tests conducted on the Taobao
platform indicate both single advertiser's objective and global profit have
been significantly improved compared to state-of-art methods.

existence of other powerful learning algorithms. Here, we explore the extent to
which a globally broadcast learning signal, coupled with local weight updates,
enables training of DNNs. We present both a learning rule, called global
error-vector broadcasting (GEVB), and a class of DNNs, called vectorized
nonnegative networks (VNNs), in which this learning rule operates. VNNs have
vector-valued units and nonnegative weights past the first layer. The GEVB
learning rule generalizes three-factor Hebbian learning, updating each weight
by an amount proportional to the inner product of the presynaptic activation
and a globally broadcast error vector when the postsynaptic unit is active. We
prove that these weight updates are matched in sign to the gradient, enabling
accurate credit assignment. Moreover, at initialization, these updates are
exactly proportional to the gradient in the limit of infinite network width.
GEVB matches the performance of BP in VNNs, and in some cases outperforms
direct feedback alignment (DFA) applied in conventional networks. Unlike DFA,
GEVB successfully trains convolutional layers. Altogether, our theoretical and

performance of the controller by the deviation of the controller's cost for a
sequence of cost functions with respect to an attenuation $\gamma$, $R^p_t$. We

getting a lot of attention from the industry and academia. In this study, we
propose a game-theoretic model predictive control (MPC) approach for
head-to-head autonomous racing and data-driven model identification method. For
the practical estimation of nonlinear model parameters, we adopted the
hyperband algorithm, which is used for neural model training in machine
learning. The proposed controller comprises three modules: 1) game-based
opponents' trajectory predictor, 2) high-level race strategy planner, and 3)
MPC-based low-level controller. The game-based predictor was designed to
predict the future trajectories of competitors. Based on the prediction
results, the high-level race strategy planner plans several behaviors to
respond to various race circumstances. Finally, the MPC-based controller
computes the optimal control commands to follow the trajectories. The proposed
approach was validated under various racing circumstances in an official
simulator of the Indy Autonomous Challenge. The experimental results show that
the proposed method can effectively overtake competitors, while driving through
the track as quickly as possible without collisions.

Part-Aware Transformer (PAT) for occluded person Re-ID through diverse part
discovery via a transformer encoderdecoder architecture, including a pixel
context based transformer encoder and a part prototype based transformer
decoder. The proposed PAT model enjoys several merits. First, to the best of
our knowledge, this is the first work to exploit the transformer
encoder-decoder architecture for occluded person Re-ID in a unified deep model.
Second, to learn part prototypes well with only identity labels, we design two
effective mechanisms including part diversity and part discriminability.
Consequently, we can achieve diverse part discovery for occluded person Re-ID
in a weakly supervised manner. Extensive experimental results on six
challenging benchmarks for three tasks (occluded, partial and holistic Re-ID)
demonstrate that our proposed PAT performs favorably against stat-of-the-art
methods.

challenge for this ultra-fine entity typing task is that human annotated data

we propose to obtain training data for ultra-fine entity typing by using a BERT

constructs an input for the BERT MLM so that it predicts context dependent
hypernyms of the mention, which can be used as type labels. Experimental
results demonstrate that, with the help of these automatically generated

perform non-probabilistic data association, i.e., they assume a single

approach addresses this issue by considering all association hypotheses with
their respective likelihoods. We formulate a holistic Bayesian estimation

determined by the jet power, and the jet-to-background density and pressure
ratios play secondary roles. Jets with higher powers propagate faster,
resulting in more elongated structures, while those with lower powers produce
more extended cocoons. Shear interfaces in the jet are dynamically unstable,
and hence, chaotic structures with shocks and turbulence develop. We find that
the fraction of the jet-injected energy dissipated through shocks and
turbulence is greater in less powerful jets, although the actual amount of the
dissipated energy is larger in more powerful jets. In lower power jets, the
backflow is dominant in the energy dissipation owing to the broad cocoon filled
with shocks and turbulence. In higher power jets, by contrast, both the
backflow and jet spine flow are important for the energy dissipation. Our
results imply that different mechanisms, such as diffusive shock acceleration,
shear acceleration, and stochastic turbulent acceleration, may be involved in
the production of ultra-high energy cosmic rays in FR-II radio galaxies.

minimizing a constrained linear functional of the two-particle reduced density

nuclear ground states were found to be well overbound, contrary to those of

provide a proper description of nuclear systems where only valence neutrons are

however, the energies obtained with the variational two-particle reduced

of spectral notions of high-dimensional expansion. Informally, entropic
independence of a background distribution $\mu$ on $k$-sized subsets of a
ground set of elements says that for any (possibly randomly chosen) set $S$,
the relative entropy of a single element of $S$ drawn uniformly at random
carries at most $O(1/k)$ fraction of the relative entropy of $S$. Entropic
independence is the analog of the notion of spectral independence, if one
replaces variance by entropy. We use entropic independence to derive tight
mixing time bounds, overcoming the lossy nature of spectral analysis of Markov
chains on exponential-sized state spaces. In our main technical result, we show
a general way of deriving entropy contraction, a.k.a. modified log-Sobolev
inequalities, for down-up random walks from spectral notions. We show that
spectral independence of a distribution under arbitrary external fields
automatically implies entropic independence.
  To derive our results, we relate entropic independence to properties of
polynomials: $\mu$ is entropically independent exactly when a transformed
version of the generating polynomial of $\mu$ is upper bounded by its linear
tangent; this property is implied by concavity of the said transformation,
which was shown by prior work to be locally equivalent to spectral
independence. We apply our results to obtain tight modified log-Sobolev
inequalities and mixing times for multi-step down-up walks on fractionally
log-concave distributions. As our flagship application, we establish the tight
mixing time of $O(n\log n)$ for Glauber dynamics on Ising models whose
interaction matrix has eigenspectrum lying within an interval of length smaller
than $1$, improving upon the prior quadratic dependence on $n$.

shared genetic etiology. Genetic covariance is defined as the underlying
covariance of genetic values and can be used to measure the shared genetic
architecture. The data of two outcomes may be collected from the same group or
different groups of individuals and the outcomes can be of different types or
collected based on different study designs. This paper proposes a unified
approach to robust estimation and inference for genetic covariance of general
outcomes that may be associated with genetic variants nonlinearly. We provide
the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator and show that our proposal
is robust under certain model mis-specification. Our method under linear

covariance, even when both linear models are mis-specified. Various numerical
experiments are performed to support the theoretical results. Our method is

observed via pulsations in the lightcurves of X-ray pulsars. They are thought
to occur due to magnetic channelling of the accreted fuel to the neutron star
magnetic poles. Some X-ray pulsars exhibit burst oscillations during Type I
thermonuclear X-ray bursts which are thought to be caused by asymmetries in the
burning. In rapidly rotating neutron stars, it has been shown that the lower
gravity at the equator can lead to preferential ignition of X-ray bursts at
this location. These models, however, do not include the effect of accretion
hotspots at the neutron star surface. There are two accreting neutron star
sources in which burst oscillations have been observed to track exactly the
neutron star spin period. We analyse whether this could be due to the X-ray
bursts igniting at the magnetic pole of the neutron star, because of heating in
the accreted layers under the hotspot causing ignition conditions to be reached
earlier. We investigate heat transport in the accreted layers using a 2D model
and study the prevalence of heating down to the ignition depth of X-ray bursts
for different hotspot temperatures and sizes. We perform calculations for
accretion at the pole and at the equator, and infer that ignition could occur
away from the equator at the magnetic pole for hotspots with temperatures
greater than $1\times10^8$ K. However, current observations have not identified
such high temperatures in accreting X-ray pulsars.

detection stage and a recognition or verification stage can cause problems
beyond failures of the detector. When the detector succeeds, it can detect

Recognizability, a latent variable, should therefore be factored into the
design and implementation of face recognition systems. We propose a measure of
recognizability of a face image that leverages a key empirical observation: an
embedding of face images, implemented by a deep neural network trained using
mostly recognizable identities, induces a partition of the hypersphere whereby
unrecognizable identities cluster together. This occurs regardless of the
phenomenon that causes a face to be unrecognizable, it be optical or motion
blur, partial occlusion, spatial quantization, poor illumination. Therefore, we
use the distance from such an ""unrecognizable identity"" as a measure of
recognizability, and incorporate it in the design of the over-all system. We
show that accounting for recognizability reduces error rate of single-image

Specifically, besides preserving the local similarities, GraphLoG introduces
the hierarchical prototypes to capture the global semantic clusters. An
efficient online expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is further developed
for learning the model. We evaluate GraphLoG by pre-training it on massive
unlabeled graphs followed by fine-tuning on downstream tasks. Extensive

eigenvalue problem for locally Lipschitz function pairs, in order to develop a
systematic framework for relating discrete and continuous min-max problems.
This also enables us to investigate spectral properties for pairs of
$p$-homogeneous functions and to propose a critical point theory for
zero-homogeneous functions. The main contributions are:
  (1) We provide several min-max relations between an original discrete
formulation and its piecewise multilinear extension. We introduce the concept
of perfect domain pairs to view comonotonicity on vectors as an extension of
inclusion chains on sets. The piecewise multi-linear extension is (slice-)rank
preserving, which closely relates to Tao's lemma on diagonal tensors. More
discrete-to-continuous equalities are obtained, including a general form
involving log-concave polynomials. And by employing these fundamental
correspondences, we get further results and applications on tensors, Tur\'an's
problem, signed (hyper-)graphs, etc.
  (2) We derive the mountain pass characterization, linking theorems, nodal
domain inequalities, inertia bounds, duality theorems and distribution of
eigenvalues for pairs of $p$-homogeneous functions. We establish a new property
on the subderivative of a convex function which relates to the Gauss map of the
graph of the convex function. Based on these fundamental results, we can
analyze the structure of eigenspaces in depth. For example, we show a simple
one-to-one correspondence between the nonzero eigenvalues of the vertex
p-Laplacian and the edge $p^*$-Laplacian of a graph. We also apply the theory
to Cheeger inequalities and $p$-Laplacians on oriented hypergraphs and
simplicial complexes. Also, the first nonlinear analog of Huang's approach for
hypergraphs is provided.

the regret itself in the stochastic setting, a key property to ensure
$\mathcal{O}(\text{polylog}(T))$ regret.

framework, termed as Multi-Dataset Pretraining, to take full advantage of the
fragmented annotations of different datasets. The highlight is that the
annotations from different domains can be efficiently reused and consistently
boost performance for each specific domain. This is achieved by first
pretraining the network via the proposed pixel-to-prototype contrastive loss
over multiple datasets regardless of their taxonomy labels, and followed by
fine-tuning the pretrained model over specific dataset as usual. In order to
better model the relationship among images and classes from different datasets,
we extend the pixel level embeddings via cross dataset mixing and propose a
pixel-to-class sparse coding strategy that explicitly models the pixel-class
similarity over the manifold embedding space. In this way, we are able to
increase intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, as well as
considering inter-class similarity across different datasets for better
transferability. Experiments conducted on several benchmarks demonstrate its
superior performance. Notably, MDP consistently outperforms the pretrained
models over ImageNet by a considerable margin, while only using less than 10%

characteristics of blurred boundaries and uneven intensity distribution,
through existing segmentation methods, the discontinuity within the target area
and the discontinuity of the target boundary are likely to lead to rough or
even erroneous boundary delineation. In this paper, we propose a new iterative
refined interactive segmentation method for medical images based on agent
reinforcement learning, which focuses on the problem of target segmentation
boundaries. We model the dynamic process of drawing the target contour in a
certain order as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) based on a deep reinforcement
learning method. In the dynamic process of continuous interaction between the
agent and the image, the agent tracks the boundary point by point in order
within a limited length range until the contour of the target is completely

performance by exploring an interactive policy in the image. The method we
proposed is simple and effective. At the same time, we evaluate our method on

instability (PDI), accounting for the spontaneous resonant excitation of GAM by
DW. The main results of previous works on spontaneous GAM excitation, e.g., the
much enhanced GAM group velocity and the nonlinear growth rate of GAM, are
reproduced from numerical solution of the two-field equations. In the fully
nonlinear stage, soliton structures are observed to form due to the balancing
of the self-trapping effect by the spontaneously excited GAM and kinetic
dispersiveness of DW. The soliton structures enhance turbulence spreading from
DW linearly unstable to stable region, exhibiting convective propagation

domain) and training (source domain) data have significantly different
distributions. While this problem can be mitigated by using the target domain
data to align the source and target domain feature representations, the target
domain data may be unavailable due to privacy concerns. Consequently, there is
a need for methods that generalize well despite restricted access to target
domain data during training. In this work, we propose an adversarial semantic
hallucination approach (ASH), which combines a class-conditioned hallucination
module and a semantic segmentation module. Since the segmentation performance
varies across different classes, we design a semantic-conditioned style
hallucination module to generate affine transformation parameters from semantic
information in the segmentation probability maps of the source domain image.
Unlike previous adaptation approaches, which treat all classes equally, ASH
considers the class-wise differences. The segmentation module and the
hallucination module compete adversarially, with the hallucination module
generating increasingly ""difficult"" stylized images to challenge the
segmentation module. In response, the segmentation module improves as it is
trained with generated samples at an appropriate class-wise difficulty level.

weighted average of both the hard training labels and uniformly distributed
soft labels. It was shown that LS serves as a regularizer for training data
with hard labels and therefore improves the generalization of the model. Later
it was reported LS even helps with improving robustness when learning with
noisy labels. However, we observed that the advantage of LS vanishes when we
operate in a high label noise regime. Intuitively speaking, this is due to the
increased entropy of $\mathbb{P}(\text{noisy label}|X)$ when the noise rate is
high, in which case, further applying LS tends to ""over-smooth"" the estimated
posterior. We proceeded to discover that several learning-with-noisy-labels
solutions in the literature instead relate more closely to negative/not label
smoothing (NLS), which acts counter to LS and defines as using a negative
weight to combine the hard and soft labels! We provide understandings for the
properties of LS and NLS when learning with noisy labels. Among other
established properties, we theoretically show NLS is considered more beneficial
when the label noise rates are high. We provide extensive experimental results

hard task, that in the literature has typically been addressed assuming the
availability of large amounts of annotated training samples for each class --
either in a fully-supervised setting, where action boundaries are known, or in
a weakly-supervised setting, where only class labels are known for each video.
In this paper, we go a step further and show that it is possible to learn to
localize actions in untrimmed videos when a) only one/few trimmed examples of
the target action are available at test time, and b) when a large collection of
videos with only class label annotation (some trimmed and some weakly annotated
untrimmed ones) are available for training; with no overlap between the classes
used during training and testing. To do so, we propose a network that learns to
estimate Temporal Similarity Matrices (TSMs) that model a fine-grained
similarity pattern between pairs of videos (trimmed or untrimmed), and uses
them to generate Temporal Class Activation Maps (TCAMs) for seen or unseen
classes. The TCAMs serve as temporal attention mechanisms to extract
video-level representations of untrimmed videos, and to temporally localize
actions at test time. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose
a weakly-supervised, one/few-shot action localization network that can be

from a well-labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Recently,
adversarial domain adaptation with two distinct classifiers (bi-classifier) has
been introduced into UDA which is effective to align distributions between
different domains. Previous bi-classifier adversarial learning methods only
focus on the similarity between the outputs of two distinct classifiers.
However, the similarity of the outputs cannot guarantee the accuracy of target
samples, i.e., target samples may match to wrong categories even if the
discrepancy between two classifiers is small. To challenge this issue, in this
paper, we propose a cross-domain gradient discrepancy minimization (CGDM)
method which explicitly minimizes the discrepancy of gradients generated by
source samples and target samples. Specifically, the gradient gives a cue for
the semantic information of target samples so it can be used as a good
supervision to improve the accuracy of target samples. In order to compute the
gradient signal of target samples, we further obtain target pseudo labels
through a clustering-based self-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on
three widely used UDA datasets show that our method surpasses many previous
state-of-the-arts. Codes are available at https://github.com/lijin118/CGDM.

learning (RL). However, with limited experience, RL often suffers from data
inefficiency for training. For un-experienced or less-experienced trajectories
(i.e., state-action sequences), the lack of data limits the use of them for
better feature learning. In this work, we propose a novel method, dubbed
PlayVirtual, which augments cycle-consistent virtual trajectories to enhance
the data efficiency for RL feature representation learning. Specifically,
PlayVirtual predicts future states in the latent space based on the current
state and action by a dynamics model and then predicts the previous states by a
backward dynamics model, which forms a trajectory cycle. Based on this, we
augment the actions to generate a large amount of virtual state-action
trajectories. Being free of groudtruth state supervision, we enforce a
trajectory to meet the cycle consistency constraint, which can significantly
enhance the data efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of our designs on
the Atari and DeepMind Control Suite benchmarks. Our method achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on both benchmarks.

review-involved recommender systems, have received increasing interests over
the past few years. Thereinto, one advanced branch is to extract salient
aspects from textual reviews (i.e., the item attributes that users express) and
combine them with the matrix factorization technique. However, existing
approaches all ignore the fact that semantically different reviews often
include opposite aspect information. In particular, positive reviews usually
express aspects that users prefer, while negative ones describe aspects that
users reject. As a result, it may mislead the recommender systems into making
incorrect decisions pertaining to user preference modeling. Towards this end,
in this paper, we propose a Review Polarity-wise Recommender model, dubbed as
RPR, to discriminately treat reviews with different polarities. To be specific,
in this model, positive and negative reviews are separately gathered and
utilized to model the user-preferred and user-rejected aspects, respectively.
Besides, in order to overcome the imbalance problem of semantically different
reviews, we also develop an aspect-aware importance weighting approach to align
the aspect importance for these two kinds of reviews. Extensive experiments

by relying on the contrastive learning paradigm, which learns representations
by pushing positive pairs, or similar examples from the same class, closer
together while keeping negative pairs far apart. Despite the empirical
successes, theoretical foundations are limited -- prior analyses assume
conditional independence of the positive pairs given the same class label, but
recent empirical applications use heavily correlated positive pairs (i.e., data
augmentations of the same image). Our work analyzes contrastive learning
without assuming conditional independence of positive pairs using a novel
concept of the augmentation graph on data. Edges in this graph connect
augmentations of the same data, and ground-truth classes naturally form
connected sub-graphs. We propose a loss that performs spectral decomposition on
the population augmentation graph and can be succinctly written as a
contrastive learning objective on neural net representations. Minimizing this
objective leads to features with provable accuracy guarantees under linear
probe evaluation. By standard generalization bounds, these accuracy guarantees
also hold when minimizing the training contrastive loss. Empirically, the
features learned by our objective can match or outperform several strong
baselines on benchmark vision datasets. In all, this work provides the first
provable analysis for contrastive learning where guarantees for linear probe

the ocean's surface geostrophic circulation (Storer et al., 2022) using a
coarse-graining (CG) method. We compare spectra from CG to those from spherical
harmonics by treating land in a manner consistent with the boundary conditions.
While the two methods yield qualitatively consistent domain-averaged results,
spherical harmonics spectra are too noisy at gyre-scales ($>1000~$km). More
importantly, spherical harmonics are inherently global and cannot provide local
information connecting scales with currents geographically. CG shows that the
extra-tropics mesoscales (100-500~km) have a root-mean-square (rms) velocity of
$\sim15~$cm/s, which increases to $\sim30$-40~cm/s locally in the Gulf Stream
and Kuroshio and to $\sim16$-28~cm/s in the ACC. There is notable hemispheric
asymmetry in mesoscale energy-per-area, which is higher in the north due to
continental boundaries. We estimate that $\approx25$-50\% of total geostrophic
energy is at scales smaller than 100~km, and is un(der)-resolved by pre-SWOT
satellite products. Spectra of the time-mean component show that most of its
energy (up to $70\%$) resides in stationary mesoscales ($<500~$km),
highlighting the preponderance of `standing' small-scale structures in the
global ocean. By coarse-graining in space and time, we compute the first
spatio-temporal global spectrum of geostrophic circulation from AVISO and NEMO.
These spectra show that every length-scale evolves over a wide range of
time-scales with a consistent peak at $\approx200$ km and $\approx2$-3~weeks.

$\rm{kpc}$ away from the Galactic plane, using the K-type giants surveyed by
LAMOST. Based on robust measurements of three-dimensional velocity moments, a
wobbly disk is detected in a phenomenological sense. An outflow dominates the
radial motion of the inner disk, while in the outer disk there exist alternate
outward and inward flows. The vertical bulk velocities is a combination of
breathing and bending modes. A contraction-like breathing mode with amplitudes
increasing with the distance to the plane and an upward bending mode dominate
the vertical motion outside $R_0$, and there are reversed breathing mode and
bending mode at $R<R_0$, with amplitudes much smaller than those outside $R_0$.
The mean azimuthal velocity decreases with the increasing distance to the
plane, with gradients shallower for larger $R$. Stars in the south disk are
rotating faster than stars in the north. The velocity ellipsoid orientation
differs between different $R$: in the range of $5<R<9$ $\rm{kpc}$, the gradient
of the tilt angle with respect to $\arctan(Z/R)$ decreases from $\sim0.83$ for
the inner disk to $\sim0.52$ for the outer disk; within $9<R<15$ $\rm{kpc}$,
the tilt of velocity ellipsoid deviates from vertical antisymmetry. A clear
flaring signature is found for both north and south disks based on the observed
vertical structures of velocity ellipsoid.

distortions induced in the output spectrum by residual broadband energy
modulations in the electron beam. We present a mathematical description of the
impact of incoherent (broadband) energy modulations on the bunching spectrum
produced by the microbunching instability through both the accelerator and the

characterization of the FERMI EEHG FEL in the photon energy range $130-210$ eV.
We find that amplification of electron beam energy distortions primarily in the
EEHG dispersive sections explains an observed reduction of the FEL spectral
brightness that is proportional to the EEHG harmonic number. Local maxima of
the FEL spectral brightness and of the spectral stability are found for a
suitable balance of the dispersive sections' strength and the first seed laser

small metallic patches on a dielectric substrate, provide very good absolute
spin sensitivity and high conversion factors due to their very small mode
volume. However, such resonators suffer from having a relatively low quality
factor, which offsets some of their significant potential advantages. The use
of superconducting patches to replace the metallic layer seems like a
reasonable and straightforward solution to the quality factor issue, at least
for measurements carried out at cryogenic temperatures. Nevertheless,
superconducting materials are not easily incorporated into setups requiring
high magnetic fields, due to electric current vortices generated in the

Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE), a deep learning model integrated with

robustness to irregular samples and its flexibility to high-dimensional input.
However, the training of NODE is sensitive to the precision of the numerical
solver, which makes the convergence of NODE unstable, especially for
ill-conditioned dynamical systems. In this paper, to reduce the reliance on the
numerical solver, we propose to enhance the supervised signal in the training
of NODE. Specifically, we pre-train a neural differential operator (NDO) to
output an estimation of the derivatives to serve as an additional supervised
signal. The NDO is pre-trained on a class of basis functions and learns the
mapping between the trajectory samples of these functions to their derivatives.
To leverage both the trajectory signal and the estimated derivatives from NDO,
we propose an algorithm called NDO-NODE, in which the loss function contains
two terms: the fitness on the true trajectory samples and the fitness on the
estimated derivatives that are outputted by the pre-trained NDO. Experiments on
various kinds of dynamics show that our proposed NDO-NODE can consistently
improve the forecasting accuracy with one pre-trained NDO. Especially for the
stiff ODEs, we observe that NDO-NODE can capture the transitions in the
dynamics more accurately compared with other regularization methods.

self-attention; a radically different architecture than convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). This makes it interesting to study the adversarial feature
space of ViT models and their transferability. In particular, we observe that
adversarial patterns found via conventional adversarial attacks show very
\emph{low} black-box transferability even for large ViT models. We show that
this phenomenon is only due to the sub-optimal attack procedures that do not
leverage the true representation potential of ViTs. A deep ViT is composed of
multiple blocks, with a consistent architecture comprising of self-attention
and feed-forward layers, where each block is capable of independently producing
a class token. Formulating an attack using only the last class token
(conventional approach) does not directly leverage the discriminative
information stored in the earlier tokens, leading to poor adversarial
transferability of ViTs. Using the compositional nature of ViT models, we
enhance transferability of existing attacks by introducing two novel strategies
specific to the architecture of ViT models. (i) Self-Ensemble: We propose a
method to find multiple discriminative pathways by dissecting a single ViT
model into an ensemble of networks. This allows explicitly utilizing
class-specific information at each ViT block. (ii) Token Refinement: We then
propose to refine the tokens to further enhance the discriminative capacity at
each block of ViT. Our token refinement systematically combines the class
tokens with structural information preserved within the patch tokens.

transport can characterize the posterior random variables given newly observed
data in real time. Compared with the state-of-the-art normalizing flow
techniques, the proposed method relies on function approximation and is
equipped with a thorough performance analysis. The function approximation
perspective also allows us to further extend the capability of transport maps
in challenging problems with high-dimensional observations and high-dimensional
parameters. On the one hand, we present novel heuristics to reorder and/or
reparametrize the variables to enhance the approximation power of TT. On the
other hand, we integrate the TT-based transport maps and the parameter
reordering/reparametrization into layered compositions to further improve the
performance of the resulting transport maps. We demonstrate the efficiency of
the proposed method on various statistical learning tasks in ordinary

whereas the other one uses global measurements of the frequency of the centre

maintained by a time-dependent auxiliary position and momentum potential, which
can be calculated for given time-dependent transition protocols. Explicit
analytic results are derived for the work and heat statistics, energy, and
entropy changes for harmonic and non-harmonic trapping potential with arbitrary

solutions of the corresponding Langevin dynamics are computed to confirm the
theoretical results. Although ieq transition of the reverse process is not the
time-reversal of the ieq transition of the forward process due to the
odd-parity of controlling parameters, their phase-space distribution functions
restore the time-reversal symmetry, and hence the energy and entropy changes of
the ieq of the reverse process are simply the negative of that of the forward
process. Furthermore, it is shown that it is possible to construct an ieq
transition that has zero entropy production at a finite transition rate, i.e.,
a fast ieq isentropic process, and is further demonstrated by explicit Langevin

the complexity of the function a deep neural network (NN) is learning can be

relating the NN's Lipschitz constant at different regions of the input space
with the behavior of the stochastic training procedure. We first observe that
the Lipschitz constant close to the training data affects various aspects of
the parameter trajectory, with more complex networks having a longer
trajectory, bigger variance, and often veering further from their
initialization. We then show that NNs whose 1st layer bias is trained more
steadily (i.e., slowly and with little variation) have bounded complexity even
in regions of the input space that are far from any training point. Finally, we
find that steady training with Dropout implies a training- and data-dependent

  Accepted for publication in MNRAS Title Updated",,"10.1093/mnras/stab1664",,"astro-ph.GA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The connection between the Stellar Velocity Ellipsoid (SVE) and the dynamical
evolution of galaxies has been a matter of debate in the last years and there
is no clear consensus whether different heating agents (e.g. spiral arms, giant
molecular clouds, bars and mergers) leave clear detectable signatures in the
present day kinematics. Most of these results are based on a single and global
SVE and have not taken into account that these agents do not necessarily
equally affect all regions of the stellar disc.We study the 2D spatial
distribution of the SVE across the stellar discs of Auriga galaxies, a set of
high resolution magneto-hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations, to
unveil the connection between local and global kinematic properties in the disc
region. We find very similar, global, $\sigma_{z}/\sigma_{r}$= 0.80$\pm$ 0.08
values for galaxies of different Hubble types. This shows that the global
properties of the SVE at z=0 are not a good indicator of the heating and
cooling events experienced by galaxies. We also find that similar
$\sigma_{z}/\sigma_{r}$radial profiles are obtained through different
combinations of $\sigma_{z}$ and $\sigma_{r}$ trends: at a local level, the
vertical and radial components can evolve differently, leading to similar
$\sigma_{z}/\sigma_{r}$ profiles at z=0. By contrast, the 2D spatial
distribution of the SVE varies a lot more from galaxy to galaxy. Present day
features in the SVE spatial distribution may be associated with specific
interactions such as fly-by encounters or the accretion of low mass satellites
even in the cases when the global SVE is not affected. The stellar populations
decomposition reveals that young stellar populations present colder and less
isotropic SVEs and more complex 2D distributions than their older and hotter
counterparts.

Previous theoretical work mainly focuses on its optimization properties, while
leaving the analysis on generalization largely open. This paper attempts to
address the issue by presenting an expectation bound w.r.t. the validation set

of the bilevel programming in practice, for instance, overfitting to the
validation set. We also present an expectation bound for the classical
cross-validation algorithm. Our results suggest that gradient-based algorithms
can be better than cross-validation under certain conditions in a theoretical

modern science and technology, but it is notoriously difficult to change the
magnetic order of a material in a rapid way. However, if a thin nickel film is
subjected to ultrashort laser pulses, it can lose its magnetic order almost
completely within merely femtosecond times. This phenomenon, in the meantime
also observed in many other materials, has connected magnetism with femtosecond
optics in an efficient, ultrafast and complex way, offering opportunities for
rapid information processing or ultrafast spintronics at frequencies
approaching those of light. Consequently, the physics of ultrafast
demagnetization is central to modern material research, but a crucial question
has remained elusive: If a material loses its magnetization within only
femtoseconds, where is the missing angular momentum in such short time? Here we
use ultrafast electron diffraction to reveal in nickel an almost instantaneous,
long-lasting, non-equilibrium population of anisotropic high-frequency phonons
that appear as quickly as the magnetic order is lost. The anisotropy plane is
perpendicular to the direction of the initial magnetization and the atomic
oscillation amplitude is 2 pm. We explain these observations by means of
circularly polarized phonons that quickly absorb the missing angular momentum
of the spin system before the slower onset of a macroscopic sample rotation.
The time that is needed for demagnetization is related to the time it takes to
accelerate the atoms. These results provide an atomistic picture of ultrafast
demagnetization under adherence to all conservation laws but also demonstrate
the general importance of polarized phonons for non-equilibrium dynamics and
provide innovative ways for controlling materials on atomic dimensions.

instability, whereas the ideal hydrodynamic (HD) counterpart is unconditionally
stable. For a partially ionised medium (for example the solar chromosphere),
both hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic species coexist and the stability of
the system has not been studied. In this paper, we perform numerical
simulations of the corrugation instability in two-fluid partially-ionised shock
fronts to investigate the stability conditions, and compare the results to HD
and MHD simulations. Our simulations consist of an initially steady 2D parallel
shock encountering a localised upstream density perturbation. In MHD, this
perturbation results in an unstable shock front and the corrugation grows with
time. We find that for the two-fluid simulation, the neutral species can act to
stabilise the shock front. A parameter study is performed to analyse the
conditions under which the shock front is stable and unstable. We find that for
very weakly coupled or very strongly coupled partially-ionised system the shock
front is unstable, as the system tends towards MHD. However, for a finite
coupling, we find that the neutrals can stabilise the shock front, and produce
new features including shock channels in the neutral species. We derive an
equation that relates the stable wavelength range to the ion-neutral and
neutral-ion coupling frequencies and the Mach number. Applying this relation to
umbral flashes give an estimated range of stable wavelengths between 0.6 and 56

  We start by introducing the notion of tree-decompositions of bounded span,

the notion of domino tree-decompositions.

multi-armed bandit (MAB) heuristics, which assume the outcomes of different

continuous spaces, similar actions yield similar outcomes. In this paper, we
utilize variants of MAB heuristics that make Lipschitz continuity assumptions

the cooperative multi-agent setting, where $V$ agents interact with a common
$K$-armed bandit problem, and each pair of agents can communicate with each
other to expedite the learning process. In the problem, the rewards are
independently sampled from distributions across all agents and rounds, but they
may be corrupted by an adversary. Our goal is to minimize both the overall
regret and communication cost across all agents. We first show that an additive
term of corruption is unavoidable for any algorithm in this problem. Then, we
propose a new algorithm that is agnostic to the level of corruption. Our
algorithm not only achieves near-optimal regret in the stochastic setting, but
also obtains a regret with an additive term of corruption in the corrupted
setting, while maintaining efficient communication. The algorithm is also
applicable for the single-agent corruption problem, and achieves a high
probability regret that removes the multiplicative dependence of $K$ on
corruption level. Our result of the single-agent case resolves an open question

automated system can help to speed up the process. To this end, this paper
presents a novel multidisciplinary approach that tackles this challenging task
by performing object segmentation on grapevine images, used to create a
representative model of the grapevine plants. Second, a set of potential
pruning points is generated from this plant representation. We will describe
(a) a methodology for data acquisition and annotation, (b) a neural network
fine-tuning for grapevine segmentation, (c) an image processing based method
for creating the representative model of grapevines, starting from the inferred
segmentation and (d) potential pruning points detection and localization, based
on the plant model which is a simplification of the grapevine structure. With
this approach, we are able to identify a significant set of potential pruning
points on the canes, that can be used, with further selection, to derive the
final set of the real pruning points.

reaches its sublimation temperature. At first, we use simple geometrical models
in image reconstructions to determine the main 2D geometrical properties of the

explore various parameters to find an optimal solution and a model consistent
with all the observables. The three methods indicate an elongated structure
with 4 x 6 mas dimensions and its major axis along the NW/SE direction. All
three of them suggest that the object looks like an elongated ring rather than
an elongated thin disk, with its northeast edge less luminous than the
South-West one. The best 3D model is a thick disk with an inner radius r=0.21
+/- 0.03 pc and a half-opening angle $\alpha_{1/2}=21\pm8\degree$ observed with
an inclination $i=44_{-6}^{10}$\,$\degree$ and $PA=150_{-13}^{8}$\,$\degree$. A
high density of dust $n=5_{-2.5}^{+5}\ M_{\odot}.pc^{-3}$ is required to
explain the contrast between the two edges by self-absorption from the closer
one. The overall structure is obscured by a large foreground obscuration $A_V
\sim 75$. The hot dust is not responsible for the obscuration of the central
engine. The geometry and the orientation of the structure are different from
those of the previously observed maser and molecular disks. A single disk is
unable to account for these differences, and we favor a description of the
source where multiple rings are entangled around the central mass.

prove that the optimal ""level of negative correlation"" is between $0.167$ and

  perspective","'Andrea Alamia' and 'Milad Mozafari' contributed equally to this work",,,,"cs.CV q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Brain-inspired machine learning is gaining increasing consideration,
particularly in computer vision. Several studies investigated the inclusion of
top-down feedback connections in convolutional networks; however, it remains
unclear how and when these connections are functionally helpful. Here we
address this question in the context of object recognition under noisy
conditions. We consider deep convolutional networks (CNNs) as models of
feed-forward visual processing and implement Predictive Coding (PC) dynamics
through feedback connections (predictive feedback) trained for reconstruction
or classification of clean images. To directly assess the computational role of
predictive feedback in various experimental situations, we optimize and
interpret the hyper-parameters controlling the network's recurrent dynamics.
That is, we let the optimization process determine whether top-down connections
and predictive coding dynamics are functionally beneficial. Across different
model depths and architectures (3-layer CNN, ResNet18, and EfficientNetB0) and
against various types of noise (CIFAR100-C), we find that the network
increasingly relies on top-down predictions as the noise level increases; in
deeper networks, this effect is most prominent at lower layers. In addition,
the accuracy of the network implementing PC dynamics significantly increases
over time-steps, compared to its equivalent forward network. All in all, our
results provide novel insights relevant to Neuroscience by confirming the
computational role of feedback connections in sensory systems, and to Machine
Learning by revealing how these can improve the robustness of current vision
models.

composed of queues receiving packets at different rates. Repeatedly, they send
packets to servers, each of them treating only at most one packet at a time. In
the centralized case, the number of accumulated packets remains bounded (i.e.,
the system is \textit{stable}) as long as the ratio between service rates and
arrival rates is larger than $1$. In the decentralized case, individual
no-regret strategies ensures stability when this ratio is larger than $2$. Yet,
myopically minimizing regret disregards the long term effects due to the
carryover of packets to further rounds. On the other hand, minimizing long term
costs leads to stable Nash equilibria as soon as the ratio exceeds
$\frac{e}{e-1}$. Stability with decentralized learning strategies with a ratio
below $2$ was a major remaining question. We first argue that for ratios up to
$2$, cooperation is required for stability of learning strategies, as selfish
minimization of policy regret, a \textit{patient} notion of regret, might
indeed still be unstable in this case. We therefore consider cooperative queues

passenger from point A to B. Nevertheless, it has been shown that passengers
are afraid of taking a ride in self-driving cars. One way to alleviate this
problem is by allowing the passenger to give natural language commands to the
car. However, the car can misunderstand the issued command or the visual
surroundings which could lead to uncertain situations. It is desirable that the
self-driving car detects these situations and interacts with the passenger to
solve them. This paper proposes a model that detects uncertain situations when
a command is given and finds the visual objects causing it. Optionally, a
question generated by the system describing the uncertain objects is included.
We argue that if the car could explain the objects in a human-like way,
passengers could gain more confidence in the car's abilities. Thus, we

overlapping degree between two values. Interval-valued overlap functions were
defined as an extension to express the overlapping of interval-valued data, and
they have been usually applied when there is uncertainty regarding the
assignment of membership degrees. The choice of a total order for intervals can
be significant, which motivated the recent developments on interval-valued
aggregation functions and interval-valued overlap functions that are increasing
to a given admissible order, that is, a total order that refines the usual
partial order for intervals. Also, width preservation has been considered on
these recent works, in an intent to avoid the uncertainty increase and
guarantee the information quality, but no deeper study was made regarding the
relation between the widths of the input intervals and the output interval,
when applying interval-valued functions, or how one can control such
uncertainty propagation based on this relation. Thus, in this paper we: (i)
introduce and develop the concepts of width-limited interval-valued functions

behaviour with respect to the width when extended to the interval-valued
context; (iii) define width-limited interval-valued overlap functions, taking
into account a function that controls the width of the output interval; (iv)
present and compare three construction methods for these width-limited

consisting of 0.5 ML-O + 0.25 ML-CO (low coverage), the saturation coverage
achieved at low temperatures (0.5 ML-O + 0.375 ML-CO, intermediate coverage),
and the equally mixed monolayer that is stable according to our calculations
but not experimentally observed yet (0.5 ML-O + 0.5 ML-CO, high coverage). For
each coverage, we study the competition between the desorption and oxidation of
CO on the corresponding optimized structure by analyzing their reaction
energies and minimum energy reaction paths. The desorption process is
endothermic at all coverages, although the desorption energy decreases as the
CO coverage increases. The process itself (and also the reverted adsorption)
becomes more involved at the intermediate and high coverages because of the
appearance of a physisorption well and concomitant energy barrier separating it
from the chemisorbed state. Remarkably, the oxidation of CO, which is
endothermic at low coverages, turns exothermic at the intermediate and high
coverages. In all cases, the minimum reaction path for oxidation, which
involves the chemisorbed and physisorbed CO2, is ruled by one of the large
energy barriers that protect these molecular states. Altogether, the larger
activation energies for oxidation as compared to those for desorption and the
extreme complexity of the oxidation against the desorption paths explain that
CO desorption dominates over the oxidation in experiments.

that produce a user-specified bifurcation diagram. The cost function contains
an error term that is minimal when the model bifurcations match the specified
targets and a bifurcation measure which has gradients that push optimisers
towards bifurcating parameter regimes. The gradients can be computed without
the need to differentiate through the operations of the solver that was used to
compute the diagram. We demonstrate parameter inference with minimal models
which explore the space of saddle-node and pitchfork diagrams and the genetic
toggle switch from synthetic biology. Furthermore, the cost landscape allows us
to organise models in terms of topological and geometric equivalence.

This growth originates from the Bose-Einstein statistics of the thermal

characteristic (SROC) is a recommended method to summarize the discriminant
capacity of a diagnostic test in the presence of study-specific cutoff values

accuracy. SROC or SAUC can be estimated by bivariate modelling of pairs of
sensitivity and specificity over the primary diagnostic studies. However,
publication bias is a major threat to the validity of estimates in
meta-analysis. To address this issue, we propose to adopt sensitivity analysis
to make an objective inference for the impact of publication bias on SROC or
SAUC. We extend Copas likelihood based sensitivity analysis to the bivariate
normal model used for meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy to evaluate how
much SROC or SAUC would change with different selection probabilities under
several selective publication mechanisms dependent on sensitivity and/or
specificity. The selection probability is modelled by a selection function on
$t$-type statistic for the linear combination of logit-transformed sensitivity
and specificity, allowing the selective publication of each study to be
influenced by the cutoff-dependent $p$-value for sensitivity, specificity, or
diagnostic odds ratio. By embedding the selection function into the bivariate
normal model, the conditional likelihood is proposed and the bias-corrected
SROC or SAUC can be estimated by maximizing the likelihood. We illustrate the
proposed sensitivity analysis by reanalyzing a meta-analysis of test accuracy

investigate the performance of proposed methods.

teleportation is the accompanying physical rotation that is necessary to adjust
the users' orientation either before or after teleportation. This is a limiting
factor for tethered head-mounted displays (HMDs) and static body postures and
can induce additional simulator sickness for HMDs with three degrees-of-freedom
(DOF) due to missing parallax cues. To avoid physical rotation, previous work
proposed discrete rotation at fixed intervals (InPlace) as a controller-based
technique with low simulator sickness, yet the impact of varying intervals on
spatial disorientation, user presence and performance remains to be explored.
An unevaluated technique found in commercial VR games is reorientation during
the teleportation process (TeleTurn), which prevents physical rotation but
potentially increases interaction time due to its continuous orientation
selection. In an exploratory user study, where participants were free to apply
both techniques, we evaluated the impact of rotation parameters of either
technique on user performance and preference. Our results indicate that
discrete InPlace rotation introduced no significant spatial disorientation,
while user presence scores were increased. Discrete TeleTurn and teleportation
without rotation was ranked higher and achieved a higher presence score than
continuous TeleTurn, which is the current state-of-the-art found in VR games.
Based on observations, that participants avoided TeleTurn rotation when
discrete InPlace rotation was available, we distilled guidelines for designing
teleportation without physical rotation.

conceptually acceptable in a flux rope magnetic support configuration with
dips? How is the plasma density distributed in the tornado-like prominence? We
calculated line-of-sight velocities and non-thermal line widths using Gaussian
fitting for Mg II lines and bisector method for H-alpha line. We determined the
electron density from Mg II line integrated intensities and profile fitting
methods using 1D NLTE radiative transfer theory models. The global structure of
the prominence observed in H-alpha, and Mg II h and k lines fits with a
magnetic field structure configuration with dips. Coherent Dopplershifts in
red- and blue-shifted areas observed in both lines were detected along
rapidly-changing vertical and horizontal structures. However, the tornado at
the top of the prominence consists of multiple-fine threads with opposite flows
suggesting counter streaming flows rather than rotation. Surprisingly we found
that the electron density at the top of the prominence could be larger (10^11
cm^{-3}) than in the inner part of the prominence. We suggest that the tornado
is in a formation state with cooling of hot plasma in a first phase, and
following that, a phase of leakage of the formed blobs with large transverse
flows of material along long loops extended away of the UV prominence top. The
existence of such long magnetic field lines on both sides of the prominence
would avoid the tornado-like prominence to really turn around its axis.

how to fine-tune pre-trained language models for deep knowledge tracing
(LM-KT). This model accurately predicts the probability of a student answering
a question correctly, and generalizes to questions not seen in training. We

  Convolution","ICLR 2022 Spotlight",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Vision Transformer (ViT) attains state-of-the-art performance in visual
recognition, and the variant, Local Vision Transformer, makes further
improvements. The major component in Local Vision Transformer, local attention,
performs the attention separately over small local windows. We rephrase local
attention as a channel-wise locally-connected layer and analyze it from two
network regularization manners, sparse connectivity and weight sharing, as well
as weight computation. Sparse connectivity: there is no connection across
channels, and each position is connected to the positions within a small local
window. Weight sharing: the connection weights for one position are shared
across channels or within each group of channels. Dynamic weight: the
connection weights are dynamically predicted according to each image instance.
We point out that local attention resembles depth-wise convolution and its
dynamic version in sparse connectivity. The main difference lies in weight
sharing - depth-wise convolution shares connection weights (kernel weights)
across spatial positions. We empirically observe that the models based on
depth-wise convolution and the dynamic variant with lower computation
complexity perform on-par with or sometimes slightly better than Swin
Transformer, an instance of Local Vision Transformer, for ImageNet
classification, COCO object detection and ADE semantic segmentation. These
observations suggest that Local Vision Transformer takes advantage of two
regularization forms and dynamic weight to increase the network capacity. Code

necessarily flat affine connection equipped with a family of surfaces that
behave like the intersections of the planes through the origin with a convex
cone in a real vector space. A radiant structure means a torsion-free affine
connection and a radiant vector field, meaning its covariant derivative is the
identity endomorphism. A radiant structure is conelike if for every point and
every two-dimensional subspace containing the radiant vector field there is a
totally geodesics surface passing through the point and tangent to the
subspace. Such structures exist on the total space of any principal bundle with
one-dimensional fiber and on any Lie group with a quadratic structure on its
Lie algebra.
  The affine connection of a conelike radiant structure can be normalized in a
canonical way to have antisymmetric Ricci tensor. Applied to a conelike radiant
structure on the total space of a principal bundle with one-dimensional fiber
this yields a generalization of the classical Thomas connection of a projective
structure. The compatibility of radiant and conelike structure with metrics is
investigated and yields a construction of connections for which the symmetrized
Ricci curvature is a constant multiple of a compatible metric that generalizes
well-known constructions of Riemannian and Lorentzian Einstein-Weyl structures
over K\""ahler-Einstein manifolds having nonzero scalar curvature. A formulation
of Einstein equations for statistical manifolds (and a conformal generalization
of statistical structures) is given that generalizes the Einstein-Weyl
equations and encompasses these more general examples.
  Finally, there are constructed left-invariant conelike radiant structures on
a Lie group with a left-invariant nondegenerate bilinear form, and the case of
three-dimensional unimodular Lie groups is described in detail.

atmosphere is replaced by a CO$_2$ atmosphere at the same or higher pressure.
The asymmetric exchange of the gaseous solutes between the CO$_2$-rich water
barrier and the air-rich bubble always results in net bubble growth. We refer
to this process as solute exchange. The dominant transport of CO$_2$ across the
water barrier is driven by a combination of diffusion and convective
dissolution. The experimental results are compared to and explained with a
simple numerical model, with which the underlying mass transport processes are
quantified. Analytical solutions that accurately predict the bubble growth
dynamics are subsequently derived. The effect of convective dissolution across
the water layer is treated as a reduction of the effective diffusion length, in
accordance with the mass transfer scaling observed in laminar or natural
convection. Finally, the binary water-bubble system is extended to a ternary

in particular by stacking self-attention layers over the entire input sequence
as in the Transformer architecture. In this work we introduce a novel attention
procedure called staircase attention that, unlike self-attention, operates
across the sequence (in time) recurrently processing the input by adding
another step of processing. A step in the staircase comprises of backward
tokens (encoding the sequence so far seen) and forward tokens (ingesting a new
part of the sequence), or an extreme Ladder version with a forward step of zero
that simply repeats the Transformer on each step of the ladder, sharing the
weights. We thus describe a family of such models that can trade off
performance and compute, by either increasing the amount of recurrence through
time, the amount of sequential processing via recurrence in depth, or both.
Staircase attention is shown to be able to solve tasks that involve tracking
that conventional Transformers cannot, due to this recurrence. Further, it is
shown to provide improved modeling power for the same size model (number of
parameters) compared to self-attentive Transformers on large language modeling

approaches that use domain-specific intermediate representations such as pose
keypoints, NWT learns its own latent representations, with minimal assumptions
about the audio and video content. To this end, we propose a novel discrete
variational autoencoder with adversarial loss, dVAE-Adv, which learns a new
discrete latent representation we call Memcodes. Memcodes are straightforward
to implement, require no additional loss terms, are stable to train compared
with other approaches, and show evidence of interpretability. To predict on the
Memcode space, we use an autoregressive encoder-decoder model conditioned on
audio. Additionally, our model can control latent attributes in the generated
video that are not annotated in the data. We train NWT on clips from HBO's Last
Week Tonight with John Oliver. NWT consistently scores above other approaches
in Mean Opinion Score (MOS) on tests of overall video naturalness, facial
naturalness and expressiveness, and lipsync quality. This work sets a strong
baseline for generalized audio-to-video synthesis. Samples are available at

Choosing the
best memory layout for each hardware architecture is increasingly important as
more and more programs become memory bound. For portable codes that run across
heterogeneous hardware architectures, the choice of the memory layout for data
structures is ideally decoupled from the rest of a program. This can be
accomplished via a zero-runtime-overhead abstraction layer, underneath which
memory layouts can be freely exchanged.
  We present the Low-Level Abstraction of Memory Access (LLAMA), a C++ library
that provides such a data structure abstraction layer with example
implementations for multidimensional arrays of nested, structured data. LLAMA
provides fully C++ compliant methods for defining and switching custom memory
layouts for user-defined data types. The library is extensible with third-party
allocators.
  Providing two close-to-life examples, we show that the LLAMA-generated AoS
(Array of Structs) and SoA (Struct of Arrays) layouts produce identical code
with the same performance characteristics as manually written data structures.
Integrations into the SPEC CPU\textsuperscript{\textregistered} lbm benchmark
and the particle-in-cell simulation PIConGPU demonstrate LLAMA's abilities in
real-world applications. LLAMA's layout-aware copy routines can significantly
speed up transfer and reshuffling of data between layouts compared with naive
element-wise copying.
  LLAMA provides a novel tool for the development of high-performance C++
applications in a heterogeneous environment.

simulation study was conducted comparing the performance of regression
calibration and simulation-extrapolation in a multivariable model. The
performance of the two methods was evaluated in terms of bias, mean squared
error (MSE) and confidence interval coverage, for ranging reliability of the
error-prone measurement (0.2-0.9), sample size (125-1,000), number of
replicates (2-10), and R-squared (0.03-0.75). It was assumed that no validation
data were available about the error-free measures, while measurement error
variance was correctly estimated. In various scenarios, regression calibration
was unbiased while simulation-extrapolation was biased: median bias was 1.4%
(interquartile range (IQR): 0.8;2%), and -12.8% (IQR: -13.2;-11.0%),
respectively. A small gain in efficiency was observed for
simulation-extrapolation (median MSE: 0.005, IQR: 0.004;0.006) versus
regression calibration (median MSE: 0.006, IQR: 0.004;0.007). Confidence
interval coverage was at the nominal level of 95% for regression calibration,

structural features to collectively tackle the two ambiguity issues. SNALS
captures the joint interactions of a hyperedge by its local environment, which
is retrieved by collecting the spectrum information of their connections. As a
result, SNALS achieves nearly 30% performance increase compared with most
recent GNN-based models. In addition, we applied SNALS to predict genetic
higher-order interactions on 3D genome organization data. SNALS showed

When documenting oral languages, unsupervised word segmentation (UWS) from
speech is a useful, yet challenging, task. It consists in producing time-stamps
for slicing utterances into smaller segments corresponding to words, being
performed from phonetic transcriptions, or in the absence of these, from the
output of unsupervised speech discretization models. These discretization
models are trained using raw speech only, producing discrete speech units that
can be applied for downstream (text-based) tasks. In this paper we compare five
of these models: three Bayesian and two neural approaches, with regards to the
exploitability of the produced units for UWS. For the UWS task, we experiment
with two models, using as our target language the Mboshi (Bantu C25), an
unwritten language from Congo-Brazzaville. Additionally, we report results for
Finnish, Hungarian, Romanian and Russian in equally low-resource settings,
using only 4 hours of speech. Our results suggest that neural models for speech
discretization are difficult to exploit in our setting, and that it might be
necessary to adapt them to limit sequence length. We obtain our best UWS
results by using Bayesian models that produce high quality, yet compressed,
discrete representations of the input speech signal.

quantum communication complexity of an $l$-player predicate $\mathsf{V}$. In
particular we show that for a distribution $p$ that is product across the input
sets of the $l$ players, the success probability of any entanglement-assisted
quantum communication protocol for computing $n$ copies of $\mathsf{V}$, whose
communication is $o(\log(\mathrm{eff}^*(\mathsf{V},p))\cdot n)$, goes down
exponentially in $n$. Here $\mathrm{eff}^*(\mathsf{V}, p)$ is a distributional
version of the quantum efficiency or partition bound introduced by Laplante,
Lerays and Roland (2014), which is a lower bound on the distributional quantum
communication complexity of computing a single copy of $\mathsf{V}$ with
respect to $p$.
  Applying our direct product theorem for small communication and techniques
related to $\mathrm{eff}^*$, we show that it is possible to do
device-independent (DI) quantum cryptography without the assumption that
devices do not leak any information. First, we analyze the parallel DI quantum
key distribution protocol given by Jain, Miller and Shi (2020), and show that
when the protocol is carried out with devices that are compatible with $n$
copies of the Magic Square game, it is possible to extract $\Omega(n)$ bits of
key from it, even in the presence of $O(n)$ bits of leakage. Second, we show
that it is possible to do sequential versions of the Jain, Miller and Shi
protocol, which give a better key rate for QKD with leakage, and let us do
sequential DI randomness expansion with leakage (it is not known how to do
parallel DI randomness expansion even without leakage). Third, we show that
proofs of quantumness with two entangled provers are resistant to leakage,
i.e., classical players who communicate $O(n)$ bits with each other cannot
convince the verifier that they share entanglement.

which converts all ABSA subtasks into a unified generative formulation. Based
on the unified formulation, we exploit the pre-training sequence-to-sequence

experiments on four ABSA datasets for seven subtasks demonstrate that our

a system's observables (to all orders in the strength of the symmetry-breaking

specifically analyze periodically driven (Floquet) systems subject to two
driving fields, where the first field imposes a spatio-temporal symmetry, and
the second field breaks it, imposing a symmetry in synthetic dimensions. We
tabulate the resulting synthetic symmetries for (2+1)D Floquet group symmetries
and derive the corresponding selection rules for high harmonic generation (HHG)

and several unanswered questions remain, particularly about the ability of
statistical models to disentangle the effects of concurrently enacted policies.
In practice, many policy evaluation studies do not attempt to control for
effects of co-occurring policies, and this issue has not received extensive
attention in the methodological literature to date. In this study, we utilized
Monte Carlo simulations to assess the impact of co-occurring policies on the
performance of commonly-used statistical models in state policy evaluations.
Simulation conditions varied effect sizes of the co-occurring policies and
length of time between policy enactment dates, among other factors. Outcome
data (annual state-specific opioid mortality rate per 100,000) were obtained
from 1999-2016 National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) Multiple Cause of Death
mortality files, thus yielding longitudinal annual state-level data over 18
years from 50 states. When co-occurring policies are ignored (i.e., omitted
from the analytic model), our results demonstrated that high relative bias
(>85%) arises, particularly when policies are enacted in rapid succession.
Moreover, as expected, controlling for all co-occurring policies will
effectively mitigate the threat of confounding bias; however, effect estimates
may be relatively imprecise (i.e., larger variance) when policies are enacted
in near succession. Our findings highlight several key methodological issues
regarding co-occurring policies in the context of opioid-policy research yet
also generalize more broadly to evaluation of other state-level policies, such
as policies related to firearms or COVID-19, showcasing the need to think
critically about co-occurring policies that are likely to influence the outcome

this approach in the quantum realm by solving the heat equation for a square

sinks within the domain. The hybrid classical-quantum approach consists in the
solution on a quantum computer of the coupled linear system of equations that
result from the discretization step. Owing to the limitations in the number of
qubits and their connectivity, we use the Gauss-Seidel method to divide the
full system of linear equations into subsystems, which are solved iteratively
in block fashion. Each of the linear subsystems were solved using 2000Q and
Advantage quantum computers developed by D-Wave Systems Inc. By comparing
classical numerical and quantum solutions, we observe that the errors and chain
break fraction are, on average, greater on the 2000Q system. Unlike the
classical Gauss-Seidel method, the errors of the quantum solutions level off
after a few iterations of our algorithm. This is partly a result of the span of
the real number line available from the mapping of the chosen size of the set
of qubit states. We verified this by using techniques to progressively shrink
the range mapped by the set of qubit states at each iteration (increasing
floating-point accuracy). As a result, no leveling off is observed. However, an
increase in qubits does not translate to an overall lower error. This is
believed to be indicative of the increasing length of chains required for the
mapping to real numbers and the ensuing limitations of hardware.

learning (RL) by learning an additive ""residual"" to the output of a given

the structure of the controller. Often, internal feedback signals of the

show superior performance of our approach on a contact-rich peg-insertion task

improve the final prosody of the TTS speech. The objective distortions measured

in wireless connectivity, serving as a proxy term for addressing the
requirements for real-time communication. As wireless systems evolve towards
6G, the ambition to immerse the digital into the physical reality will
increase. Besides making the real-time requirements more stringent, this
immersion will bring the notions of time, simultaneity, presence, and causality
to a new level of complexity. A growing body of research points out that
latency is insufficient to parameterize all real-time requirements. Notably,
one such requirement that received a significant attention is information
freshness, defined through the Age of Information (AoI) and its derivatives.
The objective of this article is to investigate the general notion of timing in
wireless communication systems and networks and its relation to effective
information generation, processing, transmission, and reconstruction at the
senders and receivers. We establish a general statistical framework of timing
requirements in wireless communication systems, which subsumes both latency and
AoI. The framework is made by associating a timing component with the two basic
statistical operations, decision and estimation. We first use the framework to
present a representative sample of the existing works that deal with timing in
wireless communication. Next, it is shown how the framework can be used with
different communication models of increasing complexity, starting from the
basic Shannon one-way communication model and arriving to communication models
for consensus, distributed learning, and inference. Overall, this paper fills
an important gap in the literature by providing a systematic treatment of
various timing measures in wireless communication and sets the basis for design
and optimization for the next-generation real-time systems.

the absence of immediate reward signals. In such instances, the agent can learn
preferred modes of behaviour that lead to predictable states -- necessary for
survival. In this paper, we pursue the notion that this learnt behaviour can be
a consequence of reward-free preference learning that ensures an appropriate
trade-off between exploration and preference satisfaction. For this, we
introduce a model-based Bayesian agent equipped with a preference learning
mechanism (pepper) using conjugate priors. These conjugate priors are used to
augment the expected free energy planner for learning preferences over states
(or outcomes) across time. Importantly, our approach enables the agent to learn
preferences that encourage adaptive behaviour at test time. We illustrate this
in the OpenAI Gym FrozenLake and the 3D mini-world environments -- with and
without volatility. Given a constant environment, these agents learn confident
(i.e., precise) preferences and act to satisfy them. Conversely, in a volatile
setting, perpetual preference uncertainty maintains exploratory behaviour. Our
experiments suggest that learnable (reward-free) preferences entail a trade-off
between exploration and preference satisfaction. Pepper offers a
straightforward framework suitable for designing adaptive agents when reward
functions cannot be predefined as in real environments.

techniques, such as optical wavefront shaping. Recently, a new type of
wavefront shaping was introduced where the extinction is manipulated instead of
the scattered intensity. The underlying idea is that upon changing the phases
or the amplitudes of incident beams, the total extinction will change due to
interference described by the cross terms between different incident beams.
Here, we experimentally demonstrate the mutual extinction and transparency
effects in scattering media, in particular, a human hair and a silicon bar. To
this end, we send two light beams with a variable mutual angle on the sample.
Depending on the relative phase of the incident beams we observe either nearly
zero extinction, mutual transparency, or almost twice the single-beam
extinction, mutual extinction, in agreement with theory. We use an analytical
approximation for the scattering amplitude, starting from a completely opaque
object and we discuss the limitations of our approximation. We discuss the
applications of the mutual extinction and transparency effects in various
fields such as non-line-of-sight communications, microscopy, and biomedical
imaging.

Hipparcos satellite and a spectroscopic orbit was obtained by Griffin (2001,
2013). Griffin found a long-term variation of the systemic velocity of the
eclipsing system due to a third body in a highly eccentric orbit (e = 0.73)
with a period of 4200 d. We have used these data, the light curve of V455 Aur
from the TESS satellite, and the Gaia EDR3 parallax to determine the physical
properties of the components of the system to high precision. We find the
eclipsing stars to have masses of 1.289 +/- 0.006 Msun and 1.232 +/- 0.005
Msun, radii of 1.389 +/- 0.011 Rsun and 1.318 +/- 0.014 Rsun and effective
temperatures of 6500 +/- 200 and 6400 +/- 200 K. Light from the tertiary
component is directly detected for the first time, in the form of a third light
of l_3 = 0.028 +/- 0.002 in the solution of the TESS light curve. From this
l_3, theoretical spectra and empirical calibrations we estimate the star to
have a mass of 0.72 +/- 0.05 Msun, a radius of 0.74 +/- 0.05 Rsun and a
temperature of 4300 +/- 300 K. The inclination of the outer orbit is 53 +/- 3

measured spectroscopic light ratio of the two eclipsing stars could lower the
uncertainties in radius from 1% to 0.25%. A detailed spectroscopic analysis

Here, we theoretically study the non-Hermitian dynamics of hybrid
electron/nuclear spin systems in the simultaneous presence of electron spin
pumping and spin-lattice relaxation. Focusing on periodic, one-dimensional
chains, we find that by adjusting the electron spin pumping to a critical
level, it is possible to steer the flow of nuclear polarization to create
site-dependent distributions where either end of the array polarizes in
opposite ways, irrespective of the initial state. By contrast, we show that
ring-like patterns - where the limit nuclear polarization is uniform - exhibit
a non-decaying, externally-driven nuclear spin current. Interestingly, cyclic
magnetic field modulation can render these processes largely robust to defects
in the chain, a response featuring some interesting similarities - and
differences - with recent findings in other non-Hermitian physical platforms.

molecular gas disc. The clouds generally have smaller sizes and masses but
higher surface densities and observed linewidths than those of Milky Way disc
clouds. An unusually steep size - line width relation and large cloud internal
velocity gradients (0.05 - 0.91 km s^-1 pc^-1) and observed Virial parameters
(alpha_obs,vir = 4.0) are found, that appear due to internal rotation driven by
the background galactic gravitational potential. Removing this rotation, an
internal Virial equilibrium appears to be established between the
self-gravitational (Usg) and turbulent kinetic (Eturb) energies of each cloud,
i.e. alpha_sg,vir=Usg/Eturb = 1.3. However, to properly account for both self
and external gravity (shear and tidal forces), we formulate a modified Virial
theorem and define an effective Virial parameter alpha_eff,vir = alpha_sg,vir +
Usg/Eext (and associated effective velocity dispersion). The NGC4429 clouds
then appear to be in a critical state in which the self-gravitational energy
and the contribution of external gravity to the cloud's energy budget (Eext)
are approximately equal, i.e. Eext/Usg~1. As such, alpha_eff,vir = 2.2 and most
clouds are not virialised but remain marginally gravitationally bound. We show
this is consistent with the clouds having sizes similar to their tidal radii
and being generally radially elongated. External gravity is thus as important
as self-gravity to regulate the clouds of NGC4429.

phenomena such as vaccine hesitancy. Unfortunately, to date, most of the models
have little to no empirical validation. One major problem in testing these
models against real-world data relates to the difficulties in measuring
opinions in ways that map directly to representations in models. Indeed, this
kind of measurement is complex in nature and presents more types of measurement
error than just classical random noise. Thus, it is crucial to know how these
different error types may affect the model's predictions. In this work, we
analyze this relationship in the Deffuant model. Starting from the
psychometrics literature, we first discuss how opinion measurements are
affected by three types of errors: random noise, binning, and distortions (i.e.
uneven intervals between scale points). While the first two are known to most
of the scientific community, the third one is mostly unknown outside
psychometrics. Because of that, we highlight the nature and peculiarities of
each of these measurement errors. By simulating these types of error, we show
that the Deffuant model is robust to binning but not to noise and distortions.
Indeed, if a scale has 4 or more points (like most self-report scales), binning
has almost no effect on the final predictions. However, prediction error
increases almost linearly with random noise, up to a maximum error of 40%.
After reaching this value, increasing the amount of noise does not worsen the
prediction. Distortions are most problematic, reaching a maximum prediction
error of 80%. Up to now most of the research focused on the properties of the
models without analyzing the types of data they may be used with. Here we show
that when studying a model, we should also analyze its robustness to these
types of measurement error.

functions (AFs) to sequentially determine the sample points. However, it has
been widely observed in practice that the best-performing AF in terms of regret
can vary significantly under different types of black-box functions. It has
remained a challenge to design one AF that can attain the best performance over
a wide variety of black-box functions. This paper aims to attack this challenge
through the perspective of reinforced few-shot AF learning (FSAF).
Specifically, we first connect the notion of AFs with Q-functions and view a
deep Q-network (DQN) as a surrogate differentiable AF. While it serves as a
natural idea to combine DQN and an existing few-shot learning method, we
identify that such a direct combination does not perform well due to severe
overfitting, which is particularly critical in BO due to the need of a
versatile sampling policy. To address this, we present a Bayesian variant of
DQN with the following three features: (i) It learns a distribution of
Q-networks as AFs based on the Kullback-Leibler regularization framework. This
inherently provides the uncertainty required in sampling for BO and mitigates
overfitting. (ii) For the prior of the Bayesian DQN, we propose to use a demo
policy induced by an off-the-shelf AF for better training stability. (iii) On
the meta-level, we leverage the meta-loss of Bayesian model-agnostic
meta-learning, which serves as a natural companion to the proposed FSAF.
Moreover, with the proper design of the Q-networks, FSAF is general-purpose in
that it is agnostic to the dimension and the cardinality of the input domain.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the FSAF achieves comparable
or better regrets than the state-of-the-art benchmarks on a wide variety of
synthetic and real-world test functions.

parallel manipulator (TPM) by using a topological design method of parallel
mechanism (PM) based on position and orientation characteristic (POC)
equations. The proposed PM is only composed of lower-mobility joints and
actuated prismatic joints, together with the investigations on three kinematic
issues of importance. The first aspect pertains to geometric modeling of the
TPM in connection with its topological characteristics, such as the POC, degree
of freedom and coupling degree, from which its symbolic direct kinematic
solutions are readily obtained. Moreover, the decoupled properties of
input-output motions are directly evaluated without Jacobian analysis.
Sequentially, based upon the inverse kinematics, the singular configurations of
the TPM are identified, wherein the singular surfaces are visualized by means
of a Gr{\""o}bner based elimination operation. Finally, the workspace of the TPM
is evaluated with a geometric approach. This 3-DOF TPM features less joints and
links compared with the well-known Delta robot, which reduces the structural
complexity. Its symbolic direct kinematics and partially-decoupled property
will ease path planning and dynamic analysis. The TPM can be used for
manufacturing large work pieces.

technological developments, such as nuclear weapons or aircraft carriers.
Arguably the most profound military implications of technological change,
however, come from more fundamental advances arising from general purpose
technologies, such as the steam engine, electricity, and the computer. With few
exceptions, political scientists have not theorized about GPTs. Drawing from
the economics literature on GPTs, we distill several propositions on how and
when GPTs affect military affairs. We call these effects general-purpose
military transformations. In particular, we argue that the impacts of GMTs on
military effectiveness are broad, delayed, and shaped by indirect productivity
spillovers. Additionally, GMTs differentially advantage those militaries that
can draw from a robust industrial base in the GPT. To illustrate the
explanatory value of our theory, we conduct a case study of the military
consequences of electricity, the prototypical GPT. Finally, we apply our
findings to artificial intelligence, which will plausibly cause a profound
general-purpose military transformation.

profound impact of hidden geometry features known as simplicial complexes,

collective behaviours on the controlled-structure complexes can reveal the
subtle interplay of geometry and dynamics. Here, we investigate the phase
synchronisation dynamics under the competing interactions embedded on 1-simplex
(edges) and 2-simplex (triangles) faces of a homogeneous 4-dimensional
simplicial complex. Its underlying network is a 1-hyperbolic graph with the
assortative correlations among the node's degrees and the spectral dimension
that exceeds $d_s=4$. We determine the time-averaged system's order parameter
to characterise the synchronisation level. In the absence of higher
interactions, the complete synchrony is continuously reached with the
increasing positive pairwise interactions ($K_1>0$), and a partial
synchronisation for the negative couplings ($K_1<0$) with no apparent
hysteresis. Similar behaviour occurs in the degree-preserved randomised
network. In contrast, the synchronisation is absent for the negative pairwise
coupling in the entirely random graph and simple scale-free networks.
Increasing the strength $K_2\neq 0$ of the triangle-based interactions
gradually hinders the synchronisation promoted by pairwise couplings, and the
non-symmetric hysteresis loop opens with an abrupt desynchronisation transition
towards the $K_1<0$ branch. However, for substantial triangle-based
interactions, the frustration effects prevail, preventing the complete
synchronisation, and the abrupt transition disappears. These findings shed new
light on the mechanisms by which the high-dimensional simplicial complexes in
natural systems, such as human connectomes, can modulate their native
synchronisation processes.

quite differently. The $0$th Landau level appears in the middle of the
spectrum, and the quantized energies above (below) it are proportional to
$n^{\frac{1}{3}} (n^{\frac{2}{3}})$, which is in great contrast to the
equally-spaced ones in the Heisenberg case. Besides, we find the
antiferromagnetic order of the $XY$ model is much more robust to the
dimerization than the Heisenberg one. The local susceptibility of the
Heisenberg case is extracted by the numerical analytical continuation, and no
sign of the pseudo-Landau levels is resolved. It is still not sure whether the
result is due to the intrinsic problem of the numerical analytical
continuation. Thus the existence of the magnon pseudo-Landau levels in the
spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ strained Heisenberg Hamiltonian remains an open question.
Our results are closely related to the two-dimensional van der Waals quantum
antiferromagnets and may be realized experimentally.

inducing hypopriors in the probabilistic model, and an inhibitory dysfunction

the problem as a multistage stochastic optimization problem, corresponding to
the minimization of the expected temporal sum of operational costs, while
satisfying the energy demand at each node, for all time. The resulting
mathematical problem has a large-scale nature, exhibiting both spatial and
temporal couplings. However, the problem displays a network structure that
makes it amenable to a mix of spatial decomposition-coordination with temporal
decomposition methods. We conduct numerical simulations on microgrids of

Decomposition methods are faster and provide more efficient policies than a

scale almost linearly with the state dimension, making them a promising tool to

by a blue continuum with a blackbody temperature of $\sim 24,000$K and
flash-ionised emission lines. After about one week, the spectra of SN 2015bf

suggest that the progenitor of SN 2015bf experienced violent mass loss shortly
before the supernova explosion. The multiband light curves show that SN 2015bf
has a high peak luminosity with an absolute visual magnitude $M_V = -18.11 \pm
0.08$ mag and a fast post-peak decline with a $V$-band decay of $1.22 \pm 0.09$
mag within $\sim 50$ d after maximum light. Moreover, the $R$-band tail
luminosity of SN 2015bf is fainter than that of SNe~II with similar peak by
1--2 mag, suggesting a small amount of ${\rm ^{56}Ni}$ ($\sim 0.009\,{\rm
M_\odot}$) synthesised during the explosion. Such a low nickel mass indicates
that the progenitor of SN 2015bf could be a super-asymptotic-giant-branch star
that collapsed owing to electron capture.

assume that the broker can access data owners' private training data, which may
not be realistic in practice. In this paper, to promote trustworthy data
acquisition for ML tasks, we propose FL-Market, a locally private model
marketplace that protects privacy not only against model buyers but also
against the untrusted broker. FL-Market decouples ML from the need to centrally
gather training data on the broker's side using federated learning, an emerging
privacy-preserving ML paradigm in which data owners collaboratively train an ML
model by uploading local gradients (to be aggregated into a global gradient for
model updating). Then, FL-Market enables data owners to locally perturb their
gradients by local differential privacy and thus further prevents privacy
risks. To drive FL-Market, we propose a deep learning-empowered auction
mechanism for intelligently deciding the local gradients' perturbation levels
and an optimal aggregation mechanism for aggregating the perturbed gradients.
Our auction and aggregation mechanisms can jointly maximize the global
gradient's accuracy, which optimizes model buyers' utility. Our experiments
verify the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms.

Queisser in 1961, is the most well-established fundamental efficiency limit for
single-junction photovoltaic solar cells. For widely-studied semiconductors
such as Si, GaAs and lead-halide perovskite, the SQ limits under standard solar
illumination (1-sun) are 32.7%, 32.5% and 31% for bandgaps of 1.12 eV, 1.43 eV

limits for single-junction solar cells may be surpassed via photon confinement,
substantially raising the theoretical limits to 49%, 45.2% and 42.1% for Si,
GaAs and methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite cells under 1-sun. Such
enhancement is possible through the containment of luminescent photons within
the solar cell, allowing the suppression of both non-radiative and radiative
recombination losses, which were considered inevitable in the classical SQ
model. Importantly, restricting photon emission from the solar cells raises the
open-circuit voltage (VOC) to values approaching the semiconductor bandgaps,
surpassing the theoretical VOC values predicted by the SQ model. The fill
factors of the cells are expected to increase substantially, resulting in

generating an object (like a molecular graph) from a sequence of actions, such
that the probability of generating an object is proportional to a given
positive reward for that object. Whereas standard return maximization tends to
converge to a single return-maximizing sequence, there are cases where we would
like to sample a diverse set of high-return solutions. These arise, for
example, in black-box function optimization when few rounds are possible, each
with large batches of queries, where the batches should be diverse, e.g., in
the design of new molecules. One can also see this as a problem of
approximately converting an energy function to a generative distribution. While
MCMC methods can achieve that, they are expensive and generally only perform
local exploration. Instead, training a generative policy amortizes the cost of
search during training and yields to fast generation. Using insights from
Temporal Difference learning, we propose GFlowNet, based on a view of the
generative process as a flow network, making it possible to handle the tricky
case where different trajectories can yield the same final state, e.g., there
are many ways to sequentially add atoms to generate some molecular graph. We
cast the set of trajectories as a flow and convert the flow consistency
equations into a learning objective, akin to the casting of the Bellman
equations into Temporal Difference methods. We prove that any global minimum of
the proposed objectives yields a policy which samples from the desired
distribution, and demonstrate the improved performance and diversity of
GFlowNet on a simple domain where there are many modes to the reward function,
and on a molecule synthesis task.

fusion to improve segmentation accuracy. However, they fail to fully consider
the feature information at different resolutions and the receptive fields of
the networks are relatively limited, thereby compromising the performance. To
tackle this problem, we propose a light Cascaded Selective Resolution Network
(CSRNet) to improve the performance of real-time segmentation through multiple
context information embedding and enhanced feature aggregation. The proposed
network builds a three-stage segmentation system, which integrates feature
information from low resolution to high resolution and achieves feature
refinement progressively. CSRNet contains two critical modules: the Shorted
Pyramid Fusion Module (SPFM) and the Selective Resolution Module (SRM). The
SPFM is a computationally efficient module to incorporate the global context
information and significantly enlarge the receptive field at each stage. The
SRM is designed to fuse multi-resolution feature maps with various receptive
fields, which assigns soft channel attentions across the feature maps and helps
to remedy the problem caused by multi-scale objects. Comprehensive experiments
on two well-known datasets demonstrate that the proposed CSRNet effectively
improves the performance for real-time segmentation.

The complexity and computational expense of simultaneously determining the

further exacerbated by the presence of various types of radio-frequency

wider bandwidths, higher bit rates and greater overall sensitivity (also to
RFI) further enhance these challenges. We present a novel approach to the
analysis of pulsar search data. Specifically, we present a neural-network-based
pipeline that efficiently suppresses a wide range of RFI signals and
instrumental instabilities and furthermore corrects for (a priori unknown)
interstellar dispersion. After initial training of the network, our analysis
can be run in real time on a standard desktop computer with a commonly
available, consumer-grade GPU. We complement our neural network with standard
algorithms for periodicity searches. In particular with the Fast Fourier

these straightforward extensions, our method is capable of identifying even
faint pulsars, while maintaining an extremely low number of false positives. We
furthermore apply our analysis to a subset of the PALFA survey and demonstrate
that in most cases the automated dispersion removal of our network produces a
time series of similar quality as dedispersing using the actual dispersion
measure of the pulsar in question. On our test data we are able to make

environmental noise that causes decoherence in the quantum system, thereby
destroying much of its quantum aspects and introduces errors while the system
undergoes quantum operations and processing. A number of techniques have been
invented to mitigate the environmental effects; however, much of these
techniques are specific to the environment and the quantum tasks at hand,
limiting their applicability. Here we propose a protocol that makes arbitrary
environments effectively noise-free or transparent. The protocol exploits
non-local superposition in evolution as a quantum resource. Consequently, it
enables full protection of quantum information and entanglement from
decoherence, and perfect quantum communications across arbitrary noisy channels
for any finite-dimensional quantum system. We also propose experimental schemes
to implement this protocol on linear optical and atomic systems.

system is connected to the statistics of natural images. Since machine learning
relies on the statistics of training data as well, the above connection has
interesting implications when using perceptual distances (which mimic the
behavior of the human visual system) as a loss function. In this paper, we aim
to unravel the non-trivial relationships between the probability distribution
of the data, perceptual distances, and unsupervised machine learning. To this
end, we show that perceptual sensitivity is correlated with the probability of
an image in its close neighborhood. We also explore the relation between
distances induced by autoencoders and the probability distribution of the
training data, as well as how these induced distances are correlated with human
perception. Finally, we find perceptual distances do not always lead to
noticeable gains in performance over Euclidean distance in common image
processing tasks, except when data is scarce and the perceptual distance
provides regularization. We propose this may be due to a \emph{double-counting}
effect of the image statistics, once in the perceptual distance and once in the
training procedure.

different epochs from 2.1 au pre-perihelion to 2.6 au post perihelion. On
December 24 and 26, 2019, close to perihelion, we detected several OH lines of
the 309 nm (0-0) band and derived a water production rate of $2.2\pm0.2 \times
10^{26}$ molecules/s. The three [OI] forbidden oxygen lines were detected at
different epochs and we derive a green-to-red doublet intensity ratio (G/R) of
$0.31\pm0.05$ close to perihelion. NH$_2$ ortho and para lines from various

$3.21\pm0.15$, corresponding to an OPR and spin temperature of ammonia of
$1.11\pm0.08$ and $31^{+10}_{-5}$ K, respectively. These values are consistent
with the values usually measured for solar system comets. Emission lines of the
radicals NH (336 nm), CN (388 nm), CH (431 nm), and C$_2$ (517 nm) were also
detected. Several FeI and NiI lines were identified and their intensities were
measured to provide a ratio of log (NiI/FeI) = $0.21\pm0.18$ in agreement with
the value recently found in solar system comets. Our high spectral resolution
observations of 2I/Borisov and the associated measurements of the NH$_2$ OPR

Only the G/R ratio is unusually high but consistent with the high abundance

Firstly, we perform deep analysis on back propagation of general triplet-based

auto-focus modulation is employed to moderate the impact of statistically
uncommon individual pairs in stochastic gradient descent optimization;
probabilistic margin cuts off the gradients of proportional Siamese pairs that
are believed to reach the optimum; power adjustment balances the total weights

our novel descriptor surpasses previous state-of-the-arts on standard

Both attitudes can be formulated via appropriately chosen traditional games. In
particular, the prisoner's dilemma game is based on pair interaction while the
public goods game represents multi-point interactions of group members. To
reveal the possible advantage of a certain attitude we extend these models by
allowing players not simply to change their strategies but also let them to

however, the subtle interplay between different states may result in a
counterintuitive evolutionary outcome where the increase of the multiplication

engineering models remains a difficult challenge in risk and reliability
engineering. We use a combination of dimensionality reduction and surrogate
modelling termed partial least squares-driven polynomial chaos expansion
(PLS-PCE) to render such problems feasible. Standalone surrogate models
typically perform poorly for reliability analysis. Therefore, in a previous
work, we have used PLS-PCEs to reconstruct the intermediate densities of a
sequential importance sampling approach to reliability analysis. Here, we
extend this approach with an active learning procedure that allows for improved
error control at each importance sampling level. To this end, we formulate an
estimate of the combined estimation error for both the subspace identified in
the dimension reduction step and surrogate model constructed therein. With
this, it is possible to adapt the design of experiments so as to optimally
learn the subspace representation and the surrogate model constructed therein.
The approach is gradient-free and thus can be directly applied to black
box-type models. We demonstrate the performance of this approach with a series
of low- (2 dimensions) to high- (869 dimensions) dimensional example problems

Notably, it offers high sensitivity and does not suffer from non-common path
aberrations (NCPA). The price to pay is a high computational burden and the
need for diversity to lift any phase ambiguity. If those limitations can be
overcome, FPWFS is a great solution for NCPA measurement, a key limitation for
high-contrast imaging, and could be used as adaptive optics wavefront sensor.
Here, we propose to use deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to measure
NCPA based on focal plane images. Two CNN architectures are considered:
ResNet-50 and U-Net which are used respectively to estimate Zernike
coefficients or directly the phase. The models are trained on labelled datasets
and evaluated at various flux levels and for two spatial frequency contents (20
and 100 Zernike modes). In these idealized simulations we demonstrate that the
CNN-based models reach the photon noise limit in a large range of conditions.
We show, for example, that the root mean squared (rms) wavefront error (WFE)
can be reduced to < $\lambda$/1500 for $2 \times 10^6$ photons in one iteration
when estimating 20 Zernike modes. We also show that CNN-based models are
sufficiently robust to varying signal-to-noise ratio, under the presence of
higher-order aberrations, and under different amplitudes of aberrations.
Additionally, they display similar to superior performance compared to
iterative phase retrieval algorithms. CNNs therefore represent a compelling way
to implement FPWFS, which can leverage the high sensitivity of FPWFS over a
broad range of conditions.

model building and then discuss in detail the implications of the new muon
$g-2$ results with the updated LHC constraints on such $\tilde{g}$SUGRA

$M_1=M_2$ case at the GUT scale with a viable bino-like dark matter, the
$\tilde{g}$SUGRA can explain the muon $g-2$ anomaly at $1\sigma$ level and be
consistent with the updated LHC constraints for $6\leq M_3/M_1 \leq 9$ at the
GUT scale; (ii) For $M_1:M_2=5:1$ at the GUT scale with wino-like dark matter,

level and be consistent with the updated LHC constraints for $3\leq M_3/M_1

importance of the location information's reliability. As society becomes more
dependent on this information in terms of the products and services, security
solutions will have to be enriched to provide countermeasures sufficiently
advanced to ever-evolving threats, forcing the joint design of communication

multi-consensus subroutine, which is optimal in the case when access to the
dual gradients is assumed, and (ii) a novel algorithm, called ADOM+, which is

treatment and monitoring. Deep learning has shown promising results in
biomedical engineering thanks to its capacity of modelling complicated data

learning models are generally not interpretable by humans, making it difficult
for clinicians to rely on the findings. In this paper, we propose a channel
attention module for deep learning models to predict cerebral palsy from
infants' body movements, which highlights the key features (i.e. body joints)
the model identifies as important, thereby indicating why certain diagnostic
results are found. To highlight the capacity of the deep network in modelling
input features, we utilize raw joint positions instead of hand-crafted
features. We validate our system with a real-world infant movement dataset. Our
proposed channel attention module enables the visualization of the vital joints
to this disease that the network considers. Our system achieves 91.67%
accuracy, suppressing other state-of-the-art deep learning methods.

Transmission losses (by power) of 4.79 dB/m, 17.34 dB/m and 11.13 dB/m are
experimentally demonstrated for the three fibers operating at 128 GHz. Signal
transmission with BER far below the forward error correction limit (10-3) for

to extrapolate in space-time using historical data and to quantify
uncertainties arising from both noisy and gappy data in physical problems.
Specifically, the proposed approach has two stages: (1) prior learning and (2)
posterior estimation. At the first stage, we employ the physics-informed
Generative Adversarial Networks (PI-GAN) to learn a functional prior either
from a prescribed function distribution, e.g., Gaussian process, or from
historical data and physics. At the second stage, we employ the Hamiltonian
Monte Carlo (HMC) method to estimate the posterior in the latent space of
PI-GANs. In addition, we use two different approaches to encode the physics:
(1) automatic differentiation, used in the physics-informed neural networks
(PINNs) for scenarios with explicitly known partial differential equations
(PDEs), and (2) operator regression using the deep operator network (DeepONet)
for PDE-agnostic scenarios. We then test the proposed method for (1)
meta-learning for one-dimensional regression, and forward/inverse PDE problems
(combined with PINNs); (2) PDE-agnostic physical problems (combined with
DeepONet), e.g., fractional diffusion as well as saturated stochastic
(100-dimensional) flows in heterogeneous porous media; and (3) spatial-temporal
regression problems, i.e., inference of a marine riser displacement field. The
results demonstrate that the proposed approach can provide accurate predictions
as well as uncertainty quantification given very limited scattered and noisy
data, since historical data could be available to provide informative priors.
In summary, the proposed method is capable of learning flexible functional
priors, and can be extended to big data problems using stochastic HMC or
normalizing flows since the latent space is generally characterized as low
dimensional.

learning (RL) in which a collection of RL subsystems, each of which learns to
accomplish a separate subtask, are composed to achieve an overall task. The
framework consists of a high-level model, represented as a parametric Markov
decision process (pMDP) which is used to plan and to analyze compositions of
subsystems, and of the collection of low-level subsystems themselves. By
defining interfaces between the subsystems, the framework enables automatic
decompositions of task specifications, e.g., reach a target set of states with
a probability of at least 0.95, into individual subtask specifications, i.e.
achieve the subsystem's exit conditions with at least some minimum probability,
given that its entry conditions are met. This in turn allows for the
independent training and testing of the subsystems; if they each learn a policy
satisfying the appropriate subtask specification, then their composition is
guaranteed to satisfy the overall task specification. Conversely, if the
subtask specifications cannot all be satisfied by the learned policies, we
present a method, formulated as the problem of finding an optimal set of
parameters in the pMDP, to automatically update the subtask specifications to
account for the observed shortcomings. The result is an iterative procedure for
defining subtask specifications, and for training the subsystems to meet them.
As an additional benefit, this procedure allows for particularly challenging or
important components of an overall task to be determined automatically, and
focused on, during training. Experimental results demonstrate the presented
framework's novel capabilities.

attention to the regularizing effect of the grazing collision for the

influence on the macroscopic quantity. By careful numerical analyses of the

collision suppresses the occurrence of a jump discontinuity of the VDF on the

becomes no longer finite in the direction of the molecular velocity parallel to

are effectively modeled as low-dimensional dynamical systems. Such systems may
behave chaotically under certain conditions, and so the ability to detect chaos

predicting these processes. Classifying a system as chaotic usually requires
estimating its largest Lyapunov exponent, which quantifies the average rate of
convergence or divergence of initially close trajectories in state space, and
for which a positive value is generally accepted as an operational definition
of chaos. Estimating the largest Lyapunov exponent from observations of a
process is especially challenging in systems affected by dynamical noise, which
is the case for many models of real-world processes, in particular models of
biological systems. We describe a novel method for estimating the largest
Lyapunov exponent from data, based on training Deep Learning models on
synthetically generated trajectories, and demonstrate that this method yields
accurate and noise-robust predictions given relatively short inputs and across
a range of different dynamical systems. Our method is unique in that it can
analyze tree-shaped data, a ubiquitous topology in biological settings, and
specifically in dynamics over lineages of cells or organisms. We also
characterize the types of input information extracted by our models for their

charging infrastructures still limits EVs' use in our everyday life. This is

observations. It is nowadays commonly used in geosciences to perform parametric
calibration. In a context of climate change, old calibrations can not
necessarily be used for new scenarios. This raises the question of DA
computational cost, as costly physics-based numerical models need to be
reanalyzed. Reduction and metamodelling represent therefore interesting
perspectives, for example proposed in recent contributions as hybridization
between ensemble and variational methods, to combine their advantages
(efficiency, non-linear framework). They are however often based on Monte Carlo
(MC) type sampling, which often requires considerable increase of the ensemble
size for better efficiency, therefore representing a computational burden in
ensemble-based methods as well. To address these issues, two methods to replace
the complex model by a surrogate are proposed and confronted : (i) PODEn3DVAR
directly inspired from PODEn4DVAR, relies on an ensemble-based joint
parameter-state Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD), which provides a linear
metamodel ; (ii) POD-PCE-3DVAR, where the model states are POD reduced then
learned using Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE), resulting in a non-linear
metamodel. Both metamodels allow to write an approximate cost function whose
minimum can be analytically computed, or deduced by a gradient descent at
negligible cost. Furthermore, adapted metamodelling error covariance matrix is
given for POD-PCE-3DVAR, allowing to substantially improve the metamodel-based
DA analysis. Proposed methods are confronted on a twin experiment, and compared
to classical 3DVAR on a measurement-based problem. Results are promising, in
particular superior with POD-PCE-3DVAR, showing good convergence to classical

underlying symmetries. However, the predictions do not respect the symmetries
exactly unless embedded in the network structure. In this work, we introduce
architectures that embed a special kind of symmetry namely, invariance with
respect to involutory linear/affine transformations up to parity $p=\pm 1$. We
provide rigorous theorems to show that the proposed network ensures such an
invariance and present qualitative arguments for a special universal
approximation theorem. An adaption of our techniques to CNN tasks for datasets
with inherent horizontal/vertical reflection symmetry is demonstrated.
Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed model outperforms baseline
feed-forward and physics-informed neural networks while identically respecting
the underlying symmetry.

innovations in diverse domains. Advances in natural language processing have
been driving the fast development in automated information extraction from
scientific literature. However, scientific literature is often available in
unstructured PDF format. While PDF is great for preserving basic visual
elements, such as characters, lines, shapes, etc., on a canvas for presentation
to humans, automatic processing of the PDF format by machines presents many
challenges. With over 2.5 trillion PDF documents in existence, these issues are
prevalent in many other important application domains as well.
  Our ICDAR 2021 Scientific Literature Parsing Competition (ICDAR2021-SLP) aims
to drive the advances specifically in document understanding. ICDAR2021-SLP
leverages the PubLayNet and PubTabNet datasets, which provide hundreds of
thousands of training and evaluation examples. In Task A, Document Layout
Recognition, submissions with the highest performance combine object detection
and specialised solutions for the different categories. In Task B, Table
Recognition, top submissions rely on methods to identify table components and
post-processing methods to generate the table structure and content. Results
from both tasks show an impressive performance and opens the possibility for
high performance practical applications.

agreements and their associated amendments is essential, in order to be kept
informed with different due dates and obligations. An automatic solution can
facilitate the daily jobs and improve the efficiency of legal practitioners. In
this paper, we propose an approach based on machine learning (ML) and Natural
Language Processing (NLP) to detect the amendment relationship between two
documents. The algorithm takes two PDF documents preprocessed by OCR (Optical
Character Recognition) and NER (Named Entity Recognition) as input, and then it
builds the features of each document pair and classifies the relationship. We
experimented with different configurations on a dataset consisting of 1124
pairs of contract-amendment documents in English and French. The best result
obtained a F1-score of 91%, which outperformed 23% compared to a
heuristic-based baseline.

machine-type communication (MTC) devices. These massive number of devices must
communicate with a single gNodeB (gNB) via the random access channel (RACH)
mechanism. However, existing RACH mechanisms are inefficient when dealing with
such large number of devices. To address this issue, we propose the
rate-splitting random access (RSRA) mechanism, which uses rate splitting and
decoding in rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) to improve RACH success
rates. The proposed mechanism divides the message into common and private
messages and enhances the decoding performance. We demonstrate, using extensive
simulations, that the proposed RSRA mechanism significantly improves the
success rate of MTC in cellular IoT networks. We also evaluate the performance
of the proposed mechanism with increasing number of devices and received power
difference.

candidate to meet the 6G ubiquitous connectivity demand and boost the
resiliency of terrestrial networks. Thanks to the high spectral efficiency and
low latency, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a potential access
technique for future communication networks. In this paper, we propose to use
the UAV as a moving base station (BS) to serve multiple users using NOMA and
jointly solve for the 3D-UAV placement and resource allocation problem. Since
the corresponding optimization problem is non-convex, we rely on the recent
advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and propose AdaptSky, a deep
reinforcement learning (DRL)-based framework, to efficiently solve it. To the
best of our knowledge, AdaptSky is the first framework that optimizes NOMA
power allocation jointly with 3D-UAV placement using both sub-6GHz and
millimeter wave mmWave spectrum. Furthermore, for the first time in NOMA-UAV
networks, AdaptSky integrates the dueling network (DN) architecture to the DRL
technique to improve its learning capabilities. Our findings show that AdaptSky
does not only exhibit a fast-adapting learning and outperform the
state-of-the-art baseline approach in data rate and fairness, but also it
generalizes very well. The AdaptSky source code is accessible to use here:
