The tensor nuclear norm (TNN), defined based on the tensor singular value
decomposition, is a state-of-the-art method to describe the low-rankness of
HSI. However, TNN ignores some physical meanings of HSI in tackling denoising
tasks, leading to suboptimal denoising performance. In this paper, we propose
the multi-modal and frequency-weighted tensor nuclear norm (MFWTNN) and the
non-convex MFWTNN for HSI denoising tasks. Firstly, we investigate the physical
meaning of frequency slices and reconsider their weights to improve the
low-rank representation ability of TNN. Secondly, we consider the correlation
among two spatial dimensions and the spectral dimension of HSI and combine the
above improvements to TNN to propose MFWTNN. Thirdly, we use non-convex
functions to approximate the rank function of the frequency tensor and propose
the NonMFWTNN to relax the MFWTNN better. Besides, we adaptively choose bigger
weights for slices mainly containing noise information and smaller weights for
slices containing profile information. Finally, we develop the efficient
alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM) based algorithm to solve the
proposed models, and the effectiveness of our models are substantiated in
simulated and real HSI datasets.

successful approach toward efficient and cost-effective machine learning.
However, models trained on a smaller subset may show poor generalization
ability. In this paper, our goal is to design an algorithm for selecting a
subset of the training data, so that the model can be trained quickly, without
significantly sacrificing on accuracy. More specifically, we focus on data
subset selection for L2 regularized regression problems and provide a novel
problem formulation which seeks to minimize the training loss with respect to
both the trainable parameters and the subset of training data, subject to error
bounds on the validation set. We tackle this problem using several technical
innovations. First, we represent this problem with simplified constraints using
the dual of the original training problem and show that the objective of this
new representation is a monotone and alpha-submodular function, for a wide
variety of modeling choices. Such properties lead us to develop SELCON, an
efficient majorization-minimization algorithm for data subset selection, that
admits an approximation guarantee even when the training provides an imperfect
estimate of the trained model. Finally, our experiments on several datasets
show that SELCON trades off accuracy and efficiency more effectively than the
current state-of-the-art.

  Effective Charges of Alkali Metal Cations",,,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Salt-in-ionic liquid electrolytes have attracted significant attention as
potential electrolytes for next generation batteries largely due to their
safety enhancements over typical organic electrolytes. However, recent
experimental and computational studies have shown that under certain conditions
alkali cations can migrate in electric fields as if they carried a net negative
effective charge. In particular, alkali cations were observed to have negative
transference numbers at small mole fractions of alkali metal salt that revert
to the expected net positive transference numbers at large mole fractions.
Simulations have provided some insights into these observations, where the
formation of asymmetric ionic clusters, as well as a percolating ion network
could largely explain the anomalous transport of alkali cations. However, a
thermodynamic theory that captures such phenomena has not been developed, as
ionic associations were typically treated via the formation of ion pairs. The
theory presented herein, based on the classical polymer theories, describes
thermoreversible associations between alkali cations and anions, where the
formation of large, asymmetric ionic clusters and a percolating ionic network
are a natural result of the theory. Furthermore, we present several general
methods to calculate the effective charge of alkali cations in ionic liquids.
We note that the negative effective charge is a robust prediction with respect
to the parameters of the theory, and that the formation of a percolating ionic
network leads to the restoration of net positive charges of the cations at
large mole fractions of alkali metal salt. Overall, we find excellent
qualitative agreement between our theory and molecular simulations in terms of
ionic cluster statistics and the effective charges of the alkali cations.

the adaptation stage, however, is often limited, due to data storage or privacy
issues. To alleviate this, in this work, we target source free UDA for
segmentation, and propose to adapt an ``off-the-shelf"" segmentation model
pre-trained in the source domain to the target domain, with an adaptive
batch-wise normalization statistics adaptation framework. Specifically, the
domain-specific low-order batch statistics, i.e., mean and variance, are
gradually adapted with an exponential momentum decay scheme, while the
consistency of domain shareable high-order batch statistics, i.e., scaling and
shifting parameters, is explicitly enforced by our optimization objective. The
transferability of each channel is adaptively measured first from which to
balance the contribution of each channel. Moreover, the proposed source free
UDA framework is orthogonal to unsupervised learning methods, e.g.,
self-entropy minimization, which can thus be simply added on top of our
framework. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2018 database show that our
source free UDA framework outperformed existing source-relaxed UDA methods for
the cross-subtype UDA segmentation task and yielded comparable results for the
cross-modality UDA segmentation task, compared with a supervised UDA methods

  volumes",,,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a novel geometric approach to characterize entanglement
relations in large quantum systems. Our approach is inspired by Schumacher's
singlet state triangle inequality, which used an entropic-based distance to
capture the strange properties of entanglement using geometric-based
inequalities. Schumacher uses classical entropy and can only describe the
geometry of bipartite states. We extend his approach by using von Neumann
entropy to create an entanglement monotone that can be generalized for higher
dimensional systems. We achieve this by utilizing recent definitions for
entropic areas, volumes, and higher-dimensional volumes for multipartite
quantum systems. This enables us to differentiate systems with high quantum
correlation from systems with low quantum correlation and differentiate between
different types of multi-partite entanglement. It also enables us to describe
some of the strange properties of quantum entanglement using simple geometrical
inequalities. Our geometrization of entanglement provides new insight into
quantum entanglement. Perhaps by constructing well-motivated geometrical
structures (e.g. relations among areas, volumes ...), a set of trivial
geometrical inequalities can reveal some of the complex properties of
higher-dimensional entanglement in multi-partite systems. We provide numerous
illustrative applications of this approach, and in particular to a random
sample of a thousand density matrices.

aligned in the direction of the shear flow respectively. Furthermore, we show
that the geometry of the phase boundary has important effects on the magnitude

mechanics may become inadequate when faced with issues related to locality,
simultaneity, signaling, causality, etc. Quantum field theory is needed. Adding
the effects of gravitation, we are led to Quantum Field Theory in Curved

reference theory to a large class of proposed space experiments testing the
foundations of gravitation and quantum theory, and the basic notions of quantum
information theory in relativistic settings.
  This is the first in a series of papers treating near-term quantum optics and
matter waves experiments in space from the perspective of QFTCST. We analyze
the quantum motion of photons and of scalar massive particles using QFTCST with
application to interferometer experiments. Our main result is that, for
photons, the weak gravitational field is to leading order completely equivalent
to an inhomogeneous dielectric, thus allowing for a description of quantum
optics experiments in curved space using familiar notions from the theory of
optical media. We also discuss interference experiments that probe first-order
quantum coherence, the importance of a covariant particle detection theory, and
the relevance of time of arrival measurements. For massive particles with
internal structure, we identify a novel gravity-induced phase shift that
originates from the different gravitational masses attributed to the excited
internal states. This phase shift can in principle be measured in space
experiments.

Image registration addresses this issue by accurately mapping the ground-truth
cancer labels from surgical histopathology images onto MRI. Cancer labels
achieved by image registration can be used to improve radiologists'
interpretation of MRI by training deep learning models for early detection of
prostate cancer. A major limitation of current automated registration
approaches is that they require manual prostate segmentations, which is a
time-consuming task, prone to errors. This paper presents a weakly supervised
approach for affine and deformable registration of MRI and histopathology
images without requiring prostate segmentations. We used manual prostate
segmentations and mono-modal synthetic image pairs to train our registration
networks to align prostate boundaries and local prostate features. Although
prostate segmentations were used during the training of the network, such
segmentations were not needed when registering unseen images at inference time.
We trained and validated our registration network with 135 and 10 patients from
an internal cohort, respectively. We tested the performance of our method using
16 patients from the internal cohort and 22 patients from an external cohort.
The results show that our weakly supervised method has achieved significantly
higher registration accuracy than a state-of-the-art method run without

contend with strategic behavior. A growing body of work on strategic
classification treats this problem as a Stackelberg game: the decision-maker
""leads"" in the game by deploying a model, and the strategic agents ""follow"" by
playing their best response to the deployed model. Importantly, in this
framing, the burden of learning is placed solely on the decision-maker, while
the agents' best responses are implicitly treated as instantaneous. In this
work, we argue that the order of play in strategic classification is
fundamentally determined by the relative frequencies at which the
decision-maker and the agents adapt to each other's actions. In particular, by
generalizing the standard model to allow both players to learn over time, we
show that a decision-maker that makes updates faster than the agents can
reverse the order of play, meaning that the agents lead and the decision-maker
follows. We observe in standard learning settings that such a role reversal can
be desirable for both the decision-maker and the strategic agents. Finally, we
show that a decision-maker with the freedom to choose their update frequency
can induce learning dynamics that converge to Stackelberg equilibria with
either order of play.

multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) representation of a communication system
between two spatially-continuous volumes. This is the concept of holographic
MIMO communications. The analysis takes into account the electromagnetic
interference, generated by external sources, and the constraint on the physical
radiated power. The electromagnetic MIMO model is particularized for a pair of
parallel line segments in line-of-sight conditions. Inspired by
orthogonal-frequency division-multiplexing, we assume that the
spatially-continuous transmit currents and received fields are represented
using the Fourier basis functions. In doing so, a wavenumber-division
multiplexing (WDM) scheme is obtained, which is not optimal but can be
efficiently implemented. The interplay among the different system parameters
(e.g., transmission range, wavelength, and sizes of source and receiver) in
terms of number of communication modes and level of interference among them is
studied with conventional tools of linear systems theory. Due to the non-finite
support (in the spatial domain) of the electromagnetic channel, WDM cannot
provide non-interfering communication modes. The interference decreases as the
receiver size grows, and goes to zero only asymptotically. Different digital
processing architectures, operating in the wavenumber domain, are thus used to
deal with the interference. The simplest implementation provides the same
spectral efficiency of a singular-value decomposition architecture with
water-filling when the receiver size is comparable to the transmission range.
The developed framework is also used to represent a classical MIMO system and
to make comparisons. It turns out that the latter achieves better performance
only when a higher number of radio-frequency chains is used.

interpretability of connectionist architectures, have been reported in the

Learning (BDL) hyperparameters, specifically, the depth, width and ensemble
size, for robust function mapping with uncertainty quantification, is still
emerging. This paper attempts to further our understanding by mapping Bayesian
connectionist representations to polynomials of different orders with varying
noise types and ratios. We examine the noise-contaminated polynomials to search
for the combination of hyperparameters that can extract the underlying
polynomial signals while quantifying uncertainties based on the noise
attributes. Specifically, we attempt to study the question that an appropriate
neural architecture and ensemble configuration can be found to detect a signal
of any n-th order polynomial contaminated with noise having different
distributions and signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios and varying noise attributes.
Our results suggest the possible existence of an optimal network depth as well
as an optimal number of ensembles for prediction skills and uncertainty
quantification, respectively. However, optimality is not discernible for width,
even though the performance gain reduces with increasing width at high values
of width. Our experiments and insights can be directional to understand
theoretical properties of BDL representations and to design practical

publication bias is firmly established in areas like medical research. Recent

Aims: Finding out whether experiments published in the International Workshop
on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM) are affected by
publication bias. Method: We review experiments published in ESEM. We also
survey with experimental researchers to triangulate our findings. Results: ESEM
experiments do not define hypotheses and frequently perform multiple testing.
One-tailed tests have a slightly higher rate of achieving statistically
significant results. We could not find other practices associated with
publication bias. Conclusions: Our results provide a more encouraging
perspective of SE research than previous research: (1) ESEM publications do not

(AGN) that, in some cases, can harbor powerful relativistic jets. One of them,
PKS 2004-447, shows gamma-ray emission, and underwent its first recorded
multifrequency flare in 2019. However, past studies revealed that in radio this
source can be classified as a compact steep-spectrum source (CSS), suggesting
that, unlike other gamma-ray sources, the relativistic jets of PKS 2004-447
have a large inclination with respect to the line of sight. We present here a
set of spectroscopic observations of this object, aimed at carefully measuring
its black hole mass and Eddington ratio, determining the properties of its
emission lines, and characterizing its long term variability. We find that the
black hole mass is $(1.5\pm0.2)\times10^7$ M$_\odot$, and the Eddington ratio
is 0.08. Both values are within the typical range of NLS1s. The spectra also
suggest that the 2019 flare was caused mainly by the relativistic jet, while
the accretion disk played a minor role during the event. In conclusion, we
confirm that PKS 2004-447 is one of the rare examples of gamma-ray emitting
CSS/NLS1s hybrid, and that these two classes of objects are likely connected in
the framework of AGN evolution.

fraction of the envelope that falls back onto the newly formed black holes. We
compare this model extensively against other prescriptions that are commonly

budget, estimates for this role in tropical cyclones vary from no effect to a
major reduction in storm intensity. To better assess this impact, here we
consider the work output of an infinitely narrow thermodynamic cycle with two
streamlines connecting the top of the boundary layer in the vicinity of maximum
wind (without assuming gradient-wind balance) to an arbitrary level in the
inviscid free troposphere. The reduction of a storm's maximum wind speed due to
water lifting is found to decline with increasing efficiency of the cycle and
is about 5% for maximum observed Carnot efficiencies. In the steady-state
cycle, there is an extra heat input associated with the warming of
precipitating water. The corresponding positive extra work is of an opposite
sign and several times smaller than that due to water lifting. We also estimate
the gain of kinetic energy in the outflow region. Contrary to previous
assessments, this term is found to be large when the outflow radius is small
(comparable to the radius of maximum wind). Using our framework, we show that
Emanuel's maximum potential intensity (E-PI) corresponds to a cycle where total
work equals work performed at the top of the boundary layer (net work in the
free troposphere is zero). This constrains a dependence between the outflow
temperature and heat input at the point of maximum wind, but does not constrain
the radial pressure gradient. We outline the implications of the established
patterns for assessing real storms.

profile nanowires (sNWs). Assuming the orientation of the Si nanowire that
maximizes the spin-orbit effects, our calculations predict that the Rabi
frequencies of the hole spin qubits inside Ge and Si sNW QD have comparable
strengths for weak electric fields. The global maximum of the Rabi frequency is
found in Si sNW QD for strong electric fields, putting this setup ahead of
others in creating the hole spin qubit. Finally, we demonstrate that strain in
the Si/Ge core/shell nanowire QD decreases the Rabi frequency. In cNW QD, this
effect is weak; in sNW QD, it is possible to optimize the impact of strain with
the appropriate tuning of the electric field strength.

particle-in-cell (PIC) code simulations. In particular, our goal is to identify
the possible sources of free energy offered by the generated EVDFs and their
dependence on the strength of the guide field. By applying a machine learning
algorithm on the EVDFs, we find that: (1) electron beams with positive
gradients in their 1D parallel (to the local magnetic field direction) velocity
distribution functions are generated in both diffusion region and separatrices.
(2) Electron beams with positive gradients in their perpendicular (to the local
magnetic field direction) velocity distribution functions are observed in the
diffusion region and outflow region near the reconnection midplane. In
particular, perpendicular crescent-shaped EVDFs (in the perpendicular velocity
space) are mainly observed in the diffusion region. (3) As the guide field
strength increases, the number of locations with EVDFs featuring a
perpendicular source of free energy significantly decreases. The formation of
non-thermal electron beams in the field-aligned direction is mainly due to
magnetized and adiabatic electrons, while in the direction perpendicular to the

Transformer architectures. However, we show that these methods cannot be
applied to more powerful attention modules that go beyond the
dot-then-exponentiate style, e.g., Transformers with relative positional

encoding is used as default, designing efficient Transformers that can
incorporate RPE is appealing. In this paper, we propose a novel way to
accelerate attention calculation for Transformers with RPE on top of the
kernelized attention. Based upon the observation that relative positional
encoding forms a Toeplitz matrix, we mathematically show that kernelized
attention with RPE can be calculated efficiently using Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT). With FFT, our method achieves $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ time complexity.
Interestingly, we further demonstrate that properly using relative positional
encoding can mitigate the training instability problem of vanilla kernelized
attention. On a wide range of tasks, we empirically show that our models can be
trained from scratch without any optimization issues. The learned model
performs better than many efficient Transformer variants and is faster than
standard Transformer in the long-sequence regime.

both size-independent, as well as size-dependent factors. By discussing how
size-dependent influences emerge from finite size effects we establish when
these effects are suppressed, and show that a simple power law captures the
interplay between size-dependent and size-independent responses. Moving beyond

estimations of the physical properties of galaxies, such as star formation rate
(SFR), stellar mass ($M_{star}$), and dust luminosity ($L_{dust}$). We focus on
normal star-forming galaxies, as they form the majority of the galaxy
population in the universe and therefore are more likely to be observed by the
LSST. We perform a simulation of LSST observations and uncertainties of 50,385
real galaxies within redshift range $0<z<2.5$. In order to achieve this goal,
we used the unique multi-wavelength data from the Herschel Extragalactic Legacy
Project (HELP) survey. Our analysis focus on two fields: ELAIS-N1 and COSMOS.
To obtain galaxy physical properties we fit their Spectral Energy Distributions
(SEDs) using the Code Investigating GALaxy Emission (CIGALE). We compare the
main galaxy physical properties obtained from the fit of the observed
multi-wavelength photometry of galaxies (from UV to FIR) to the ones obtained
from the simulated LSST optical measurements only. The stellar masses estimated
based on the LSST measurements are in agreement with the full UV-FIR SED
estimations, as they depend mainly on the UV and optical emission, well covered
by LSST in the considered redshift range. We obtain a clear overestimation of
SFR, $L_{dust}$, $M_{dust}$ estimated with LSST only, highly correlated with
redshift. We investigate the cause of this overestimation and we conclude that
it is related to an overestimation of the dust attenuation, both UV and NIR. We
find that it is necessary to employ auxiliary rest-frame mid-infrared
observations, simulated UV observations, or FUV attenuation (AFUV)- Mstar
relation, to correct the overestimation.

with long-range interactions and lack a principled way to model higher-order
structures. These problems can be attributed to the strong coupling between the
computational graph and the input graph structure. The recently proposed
Message Passing Simplicial Networks naturally decouple these elements by
performing message passing on the clique complex of the graph. Nevertheless,
these models can be severely constrained by the rigid combinatorial structure
of Simplicial Complexes (SCs). In this work, we extend recent theoretical
results on SCs to regular Cell Complexes, topological objects that flexibly
subsume SCs and graphs. We show that this generalisation provides a powerful
set of graph ""lifting"" transformations, each leading to a unique hierarchical
message passing procedure. The resulting methods, which we collectively call CW
Networks (CWNs), are strictly more powerful than the WL test and not less
powerful than the 3-WL test. In particular, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
one such scheme, based on rings, when applied to molecular graph problems. The
proposed architecture benefits from provably larger expressivity than commonly
used GNNs, principled modelling of higher-order signals and from compressing
the distances between nodes. We demonstrate that our model achieves
state-of-the-art results on a variety of molecular datasets.

address the little hierarchy problem (i.e. fraternal models), the twin tau has
been identified as a promising candidate for dark matter. In this class of
scenarios, however, the elastic scattering cross section of the twin tau with
nuclei exceeds the bounds from XENON1T and other recent direct detection
experiments. In this paper, we propose a modification to the Fraternal Twin
Higgs scenario that we call $\mathbb{Z}_2$FTH, incorporating visible and twin
hypercharged scalars (with $Y = 2$) which break twin electromagnetism. This
leads to new mass terms for the twin tau that are unrelated to its Yukawa
coupling, as well as additional annihilation channels via the massive twin
photon. We show that these features make it possible for the right-handed twin
tau to freeze out with an acceptable thermal relic abundance while scattering
with nuclei at a rate that is well below existing constraints. Nonetheless,
large portions of the currently viable parameter space in this model are within
the reach of planned direct detection experiments. The prospects for indirect
detection using gamma rays and cosmic-ray antiprotons are also promising in
this model. Furthermore, if the twin neutrino is light, the predicted deviation
of $\Delta N_\mathrm{eff} \approx 0.1$ would be within reach of Stage 4 CMB
experiments. Finally, the high luminosity LHC should be able to probe the
entire parameter space of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$FTH model through charged scalar
searches. We also discuss how searches for long-lived particles are starting to

flows or 'bit threads'. We consider the Lorentzian analog to reformulate the
'complexity=volume' conjecture using Lorentzian flows -- timelike vector fields
whose minimum flux through a boundary subregion is equal to the volume of the
homologous maximal bulk Cauchy slice. By the nesting of Lorentzian flows,
holographic complexity is shown to obey a number of properties. Particularly,
the rate of complexity is bounded below by conditional complexity, describing a
multi-step optimization with intermediate and final target states. We provide
multiple explicit geometric realizations of Lorentzian flows in AdS
backgrounds, including their time-dependence and behavior near the singularity
in a black hole interior. Conceptually, discretized flows are interpreted as
Lorentzian threads or 'gatelines'. Upon selecting a reference state, complexity
thence counts the minimum number of gatelines needed to prepare a target state
described by a tensor network discretizing the maximal volume slice, matching
its quantum information theoretic definition. We point out that suboptimal
tensor networks are important to fully characterize the state, leading us to
propose a refined notion of complexity as an ensemble average. The bulk
symplectic potential provides a specific 'canonical' thread configuration
characterizing perturbations around arbitrary CFT states. Consistency of this
solution requires the bulk satisfy the linearized Einstein's equations, which
are shown to be equivalent to the holographic first law of complexity, thereby
advocating for a principle of 'spacetime complexity'. Lastly, we argue
Lorentzian threads provide a notion of emergent time. This article is an

infinitely-many other space-time events, it is necessary to make a prior
assumption about our location to extract predictions. The principle of
mediocrity entails that we live at asymptotic late times, when the occupational
probabilities of vacua has settled to a near-equilibrium distribution. In this
paper we further develop the idea that we instead exist during the approach to
equilibrium, much earlier than the exponentially-long mixing time. In this case
we are most likely to reside in vacua that are easily accessed dynamically.
Using first-passage statistics, we prove that vacua that maximize their
space-time volume at early times have: 1. maximal ever-hitting probability; 2.
minimal mean first-passage time; and 3. minimal decay rate. These requirements
are succinctly captured by an early-time measure. The idea that we live at
early times is a predictive guiding principle, with many phenomenological
implications. First, our vacuum should lie deep in a funneled region, akin to
folding energy landscapes of proteins. Second, optimal landscape regions are
characterized by relatively short-lived vacua, with lifetime of order the de
Sitter Page time. For our vacuum, this lifetime is $\sim 10^{130}$~years, which
is consistent with the Standard Model estimate due to Higgs metastability.
Third, the measure favors vacua with small, positive vacuum energy. This can
address the cosmological constant problem, provided there are sufficiently many
vacua in the entire ensemble of funnels. As a concrete example, we study the
Bousso-Polchinski lattice of flux vacua, and find that the early-time measure
favors lattices with the fewest number of flux dimensions. This favors
compactifications with a large hierarchy between the lightest modulus and all
other K\""ahler and complex structure moduli.

covariant operations with catalysts that may create a correlation within them

to the correlation generated among multiple catalysts. We extend our analysis

we explore the connection between the orientation of the field and the
dynamical state of the gas. We find that the onset of gravitational instability
in molecular gas above a density of $\rho\sim10^{-21}\,\mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}$

changes from mainly perpendicular to preferentially parallel to the field
lines. A connection between the three-dimensional alignment and projected
two-dimensional observables is non-trivial, because of a large dispersion of
the magnetic field orientation along the line of sight. The turbulent
correlation lengths can be small compared to the typical integration lengths.
As a consequence the small scale signal of the orientation can sensitively
depend on the line of sight or the dynamical state of the cloud, can fluctuate
stochastically or be completely averaged out. With higher spatial resolution
more small scale structures are resolved, which aggravates the link between
magneto-hydrodynamical quantities and projected observables.

fermions induce an $\Omega/q$ Landau damping of rotors (i.e., the dynamical
critical exponent is $z=3$) and Landau overdamped rotors give rise to non-Fermi

the fact that a fermionic spin is by itself not a conserved quantity due to
spin-spin coupling to rotors, and a combination of self-energy and vertex
corrections replaces $1/q$ in the Landau damping by a constant. We discuss the
implication of these results to experiments.

interrupted by sudden spin-ups called glitches, whose physical origin is still
a mystery. One suggested explanation for at least the small glitches are
starquakes, that is, failures of the solid neutron star crust, in which the
progressive reduction in the centrifugal force deforms the star, stressing the
solid until it breaks. This produces a spin-up, dissipating energy inside the
star. We analyze the deformations produced by the decreasing centrifugal force,
modeling the star with a fluid core and a solid crust, each with uniform
density and with the core possibly denser than the crust, as a simple
approximation to the strong density gradient present in real neutron stars. The
deformation is qualitatively different from the previously studied case of
equal densities. The former more closely resembles the behavior of a fluid
star, in which the core-crust interface is a surface of constant gravitational
plus centrifugal potential. Regardless of the uncertain breaking strain, the
glitch activity in this model is several orders of magnitude smaller than
observed, even if only small glitches are considered. For a large breaking
strain, suggested by simulations, glitches due to starquakes could be roughly
of the correct size but much less frequent than observed glitches. The energy
released in each glitch is much larger than in the model of angular momentum
transfer from a faster rotating superfluid in the inner crust. On the other
hand, we cannot rule out that the heating produced by small starquakes could
trigger glitches by allowing neutron superfluid vortices to move. We also
confirm that stresses in the neutron star crust can in principle support an
ellipticity much larger than some observational upper limits from pulsar timing
and continuous gravitational wave searches.

Evidently, static word embeddings are insufficient to integrate the diverse

contextualized word embedding has been introduced to better capture the
semantic meaning of each word based on its context. Two of these language

useful picture of the phase diagram of broken and unbroken phases. We provide a
transparent derivation of the area law for charged line operators in the
unbroken phase and describe the dynamics of gapless Goldstone modes in the

the broken phase and a description of the phase transition that should be valid
above an upper critical dimension, which we discuss. We also discuss general
consequences of emergent one-form symmetries at zero and finite temperature.

independent gaussian parameters. For networks of constant depth and with a
large range of widths (for instance, it suffices if the width of each layer is
polynomial in that of any other layer), small perturbations of input vectors
lead to large changes of outputs. This generalizes results of Daniely and
Schacham (2020) for networks of rapidly decreasing width and of Bubeck et al
(2021) for two-layer networks. The proof shows that adversarial examples arise
in these networks because the functions that they compute are very close to
linear. Bottleneck layers in the network play a key role: the minimal width up
to some point in the network determines scales and sensitivities of mappings
computed up to that point. The main result is for networks with constant depth,
but we also show that some constraint on depth is necessary for a result of
this kind, because there are suitably deep networks that, with constant
probability, compute a function that is close to constant.

also develop an efficient and exact technique to make the sharpness tractable,

physical processes and controls various material properties, appears in a wide
variety of forms. Defining unified and measurable dimensionless quantifiers,
allowing quantitative comparison of mechanical disorder across widely different
physical systems, is therefore an important goal. Two such coarse-grained
dimensionless quantifiers (among others) appear in the literature, one is
related to the spectral broadening of discrete phononic bands in finite-size
systems (accessible through computer simulations) and the other is related the
spatial fluctuations of the shear modulus in macroscopically large systems. The
latter has been recently shown to determine the amplitude of wave attenuation
rates in the low-frequency limit (accessible through laboratory experiments).
Here, using two alternative and complementary theoretical approaches linked to
the vibrational spectra of solids, we derive a basic scaling relation between
the two dimensionless quantifiers. This scaling relation, which is supported by
simulational data, shows that the two apparently distinct quantifiers are in
fact intrinsically related, giving rise to a unified quantifier of mechanical
disorder in solids. We further discuss the obtained results in the context of
the unjamming transition taking place in soft sphere packings at low confining
pressures, in addition to their implications for our understanding of the
low-frequency vibrational spectra of disordered solids in general, and in
particular those of glassy systems.

backbone in the field of computer vision. In spite of the impressive success
made by transformers in a variety of vision tasks, it still suffers from heavy
computation and intensive memory costs. To address this limitation, this paper
presents an Interpretability-Aware REDundancy REDuction framework (IA-RED$^2$).
We start by observing a large amount of redundant computation, mainly spent on
uncorrelated input patches, and then introduce an interpretable module to
dynamically and gracefully drop these redundant patches. This novel framework
is then extended to a hierarchical structure, where uncorrelated tokens at
different stages are gradually removed, resulting in a considerable shrinkage
of computational cost. We include extensive experiments on both image and video
tasks, where our method could deliver up to 1.4x speed-up for state-of-the-art
models like DeiT and TimeSformer, by only sacrificing less than 0.7% accuracy.
More importantly, contrary to other acceleration approaches, our method is
inherently interpretable with substantial visual evidence, making vision
transformer closer to a more human-understandable architecture while being
lighter. We demonstrate that the interpretability that naturally emerged in our
framework can outperform the raw attention learned by the original visual
transformer, as well as those generated by off-the-shelf interpretation
methods, with both qualitative and quantitative results. Project Page:

combining representations is both principled and practical for learning a
ranking function for a particular query. In extremely data-scarce settings,
however, the amount of labeled data available for a particular query can lead
to a highly variable and ineffective ranking function. One way to mitigate the
effect of the small amount of data is to leverage information from semantically
similar queries. Indeed, as we demonstrate in simulation settings and real data
examples, when semantically similar queries are available it is possible to
gainfully use them when ranking with respect to a particular query. We describe
and explore this phenomenon in the context of the bias-variance trade off and
apply it to the data-scarce settings of a Bing navigational graph and the

introduce a notion of joint accessibility, which measures the extent to which a

accessibility under the standard factorization-based collaborative filtering

joint accessibility is violated. Moreover, we show that these conditions can
easily be violated when the users are represented by a single feature vector.

bipartite bilinear constraint together with bounds, it is always possible to
sequentially lift a seed inequality that is valid for a restriction obtained by
fixing variables to their bounds, when the lifting is accomplished using affine
functions of the fixed variables. In this setting, sequential lifting involves
solving a non-convex nonlinear optimization problem each time a variable is
lifted, just as in Mixed Integer Linear Programming. To reduce the
computational burden associated with this procedure, we develop a framework
based on subadditive approximations of lifting functions that permits
sequence-independent lifting of seed inequalities for separable bipartite
bilinear sets. In particular, this framework permits the derivation of
closed-form valid inequalities. We then study a separable bipartite bilinear
set where the coefficients form a minimal cover with respect to the
right-hand-side. For this set, we introduce a bilinear cover inequality, which
is second-order cone representable. We argue that this bilinear cover
inequality is strong by showing that it yields a constant-factor approximation
of the convex hull of the original set. We study its lifting function and
construct a two-slope subadditive upper bound. Using this subadditive
approximation, we lift fixed variable pairs in closed-form, thus deriving a
lifted bilinear cover inequality that is valid for general separable bipartite
bilinear sets with box constraints.

lossless open systems in which the scattering matrix is unitary. There is then
an equivalence among the energy excited within the medium, the Wigner time
delay, and the density of states. But these equivalences fall away in the
presence of material loss or gain. In this paper, we use microwave
measurements, numerical simulations, and theoretical analysis to discover the
changing relationships among the internal field, transmission, transmission
time, dwell time, total excited energy, and the density of states in with loss
and gain, and their dependence upon dimensionality and spectral overlap. The
total energy excited is equal to the dwell time. In 1D, the average
transmission time is independent of loss, gain, and scattering strength. In
higher dimensions, however, the average transmission time falls with loss,
scattering strength and channel number, and increases with gain. It is the sum
over Lorentzian functions associated with the zeros as well as the poles of the
transmission matrix. This endows transmission zeros with robust topological
characteristics: in unitary media, zeros occur either singly on the real axis
or as conjugate pairs in the complex frequency plane. In weakly absorbing
media, the spectrum of the transmission time of the lowest transmission
eigenchannel is the sum of Lorentzians due to transmission zeros plus a
background due to far-off-resonance poles. The average density of transmission
zeros in the complex plane is found from the fall of the average transmission
time with absorption as zeros are swept into the lower half of the complex
frequency plane. We show that the disposition of poles and zeros in the complex
frequency plane provides a framework for understanding and controlling wave
propagation in non-Hermitian systems.

two-band Hubbard model to describe the low-energy electron states, with
correlations controlled by a effective Hubbard $U$ and Hund's $J$. The
electrons are coupled to the octahedral breathing-mode lattice distortions.
Treating the lattice semiclassically, we apply the Hartree-Fock approximation
to obtain the phase diagram for the ground-state as a function of the various
parameters. We find that the 2D confinement leads to strong preference for the
planar $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital even in the absence of a crystal-field splitting.
The $d_{x^2-y^2}$ polarization is enhanced by adding a crystal field splitting,
whereas coupling to breathing-mode lattice distortions weakens it. However, the
former effect is stronger, leading to $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital and
antiferromagnetic (AFM) order at reasonable values of $U,J$ and thus to the
possibility to realize cuprate-like superconductivity in this 2D material upon
doping. We also find that the application of tensile strain enhances the
cuprate-like phase and phases with orbital polarization in general, by reducing
the $t_2 / t_1$ ratio of next-nearest to nearest neighbour hopping. On the
contrary, systems with compressive stress have an increased hopping ratio and
consequently show a preference for ferromagnetic (FM) phases, including,

satellites around M31 than around the Milky Way down to equivalent magnitude
and surface brightness limits. We find that dwarfs in close proximity to a
massive galaxy generally show more scatter in their Kormendy relations than
those in isolation. Specifically, isolated Local Group dwarf galaxies show a
tighter trend of half-light radius versus magnitude than the satellite

customer query, retrieve all semantically related products from a huge catalog
of size 100 million, or more. Because of large catalog spaces and real-time
latency constraints, semantic matching algorithms not only desire high recall
but also need to have low latency. Conventional lexical matching approaches
(e.g., Okapi-BM25) exploit inverted indices to achieve fast inference time, but
fail to capture behavioral signals between queries and products. In contrast,
embedding-based models learn semantic representations from customer behavior
data, but the performance is often limited by shallow neural encoders due to
latency constraints. Semantic product search can be viewed as an eXtreme
Multi-label Classification (XMC) problem, where customer queries are input
instances and products are output labels. In this paper, we aim to improve
semantic product search by using tree-based XMC models where inference time
complexity is logarithmic in the number of products. We consider hierarchical
linear models with n-gram features for fast real-time inference.
Quantitatively, our method maintains a low latency of 1.25 milliseconds per
query and achieves a 65% improvement of Recall@100 (60.9% v.s. 36.8%) over a
competing embedding-based DSSM model. Our model is robust to weight pruning
with varying thresholds, which can flexibly meet different system requirements
for online deployments. Qualitatively, our method can retrieve products that
are complementary to existing product search system and add diversity to the
match set.

of experience in memory and use these memories, in combination with current

long-term objectives are maximized. The world is highly dynamic, and
behavioural agents must generalize across a variety of environments and
objectives over time. This scenario can be modeled as a partially-observable
multi-task reinforcement learning problem. We use genetic programming to evolve
highly-generalized agents capable of operating in six unique environments from
the control literature, including OpenAI's entire Classic Control suite. This
requires the agent to support discrete and continuous actions simultaneously.
No task-identification sensor inputs are provided, thus agents must identify
tasks from the dynamics of state variables alone and define control policies
for each task. We show that emergent hierarchical structure in the evolving
programs leads to multi-task agents that succeed by performing a temporal
decomposition and encoding of the problem environments in memory. The resulting
agents are competitive with task-specific agents in all six environments.
Furthermore, the hierarchical structure of programs allows for dynamic run-time
complexity, which results in relatively efficient operation.

(ACS) of a random process from a set of measured data. This is obtained from
the first column and the first row of the sample covariance matrix (SCM) after
averaging along its diagonals. Then, the power spectrum of the correlation
sequence is estimated using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The DFT
coefficients corresponding to the angles within the noise-plus-interference
region are used to reconstruct the noise-plus-interference covariance matrix
(NPICM), while the desired signal covariance matrix (DSCM) is estimated by
identifying and removing the noise-plus-interference component from the SCM. In
particular, the spatial power spectrum of the estimated received signal is
utilized to compute the correlation sequence corresponding to the
noise-plus-interference in which the dominant DFT coefficient of the
noise-plus-interference is captured. A key advantage of the proposed adaptive
beamforming is that only little prior information is required. Specifically, an
imprecise knowledge of the array geometry and of the angular sectors in which
the interferences are located is needed. Simulation results demonstrate that
compared with previous reconstruction-based beamformers, the proposed approach
can achieve better overall performance in the case of multiple mismatches over
a very large range of input signal-to-noise ratios.

or phase-space information is used, and in how they distinguish satellite and
main haloes; all of these features have some impact on the model galaxies, even
after the trees are post-processed and homogenised by GALFORM. The stellar mass
function is insensitive to the halo and merger tree finder adopted. However, we
find that the number of central and satellite galaxies in GALFORM does depend
slightly on the halo finder/tree builder. The number of galaxies without
resolved subhaloes depends strongly on the tree builder, with VELOCIRAPTOR, a
phase-space finder, showing the largest population of such galaxies. The
distributions of stellar masses, cold and hot gas masses, and star formation
rates agree well between different halo finders/tree builders. However, because
VELOCIRAPTOR has more early progenitor haloes, with these trees GALFORM
produces slightly higher star formation rate densities at high redshift,
smaller galaxy sizes, and larger stellar masses for the spheroid component.
Since in all cases these differences are small we conclude that, when all of
the trees are processed so that the main progenitor mass increases
monotonically, the predicted GALFORM galaxy populations are stable and
consistent for these four halo finders/tree builders.

accelerometer signals. The model we suggest is based on continuous wavelet
transform (CWT) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Wavelet transform
localizes signal features both in time and frequency domains and after that a
CNN extracts these features and recognizes activity. It is also worth noting
that CWT converts 1D accelerometer signal into 2D images and thus enables to
obtain better results as 2D networks have a significantly higher predictive
capacity. In the course of the work we build a convolutional neural network and
vary such model parameters as number of spatial axes, number of layers, number

intermediate time scales a quasi-plateau since the NPs are trapped by the mesh
for very long times. Escaping from this local cage is a process that depends
strongly on the local environment, thus giving rise to an extremely
heterogeneous relaxation dynamics. The simulation data are compared with the
two main theories for the diffusion process of NPs in gels. Both theories give
a very good description of the $C-$dependence of the NP diffusion constant, but
fail to reproduce the heterogeneous dynamics at intermediate time scales.

satisfies conformal covariance properties. We call such measure a Minkowski

spin angular momentum is plotted against orbital angular momentum, much like
the position-velocity phase diagram in classical mechanics. We use four sets of
highly accurate time-resolved x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (TR-XMCD) data
to construct four correlation diagrams for iron and cobalt. To our surprise, a
pattern emerges. The trace on the correlation diagram for iron is an arc, and
at the end of demagnetization, it has a pronounced cusp. The correlation
diagram for cobalt is different and appears more linear, but with kinks. We
carry out first-principles calculations with two different methods:
time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and time-dependent Liouville
density functional theory (TDLDFT). These two methods agree that the
experimental findings for both Fe and Co are not due t experimental errors. It
is the spin-orbit coupling that correlates the spin dynamics to the orbital
dynamics.Microscopically, Fe and Co have different orbital occupations, which
leads to distinctive correlation diagrams. We believe that this correlation
diagram presents a useful tool to better understand spin and orbital dynamics
on an ultrafast time scale. A brief discussion on the magnetic anisotropy

some 200 structures extracted using dendrograms are examined. We identify two
distinct regions, one of which has a prominent protrusion extending from the

gas to cold dense gas and filaments. The scale at which the warm gas becomes
unstable and undergoes a thermal condensation is about 15 pc, corresponding to
a cooling time about 1.5 Myr. We find that a transition from subsonic to
trans-sonic turbulence is associated with the thermal condensation. A large

humanitarian logistics models that have approached equity using the Gini
coefficient do not actually optimize its original formulation, but use
alternative definitions that do not necessarily replicate that original Gini

temperature changes will impact different regions and climate differently. As
such, it is necessary to model both temperature changes and transmission flows

components (variables, objectives, and constraints) that are functions defined
over infinite-dimensional domains. Examples include continuous-time dynamic
optimization (time is an infinite domain and components are a function of
time), PDE optimization problems (space and time are infinite domains and
components are a function of space-time), as well as stochastic and
semi-infinite optimization (random space is an infinite domain and components
are a function of such random space). InfiniteOpt problems also arise from
combinations of these problem classes (e.g., stochastic PDE optimization).
Given the infinite-dimensional nature of objectives and constraints, one often
needs to define appropriate quantities (measures) to properly pose the problem.
Moreover, InfiniteOpt problems often need to be transformed into a finite
dimensional representation so that they can be solved numerically. In this
work, we present a unifying abstraction that facilitates the modeling,
analysis, and solution of InfiniteOpt problems. The proposed abstraction
enables a general treatment of infinite-dimensional domains and provides a
measure-centric paradigm to handle associated variables, objectives, and
constraints. This abstraction allows us to transfer techniques across
disciplines and with this identify new, interesting, and useful modeling
paradigms (e.g., event constraints and risk measures defined over time
domains). Our abstraction serves as the backbone of an intuitive Julia-based
modeling package that we call InfiniteOpt.jl. We demonstrate the developments
using diverse case studies arising in engineering.

shock-containing jets. The flow is linearised around a spatially periodic mean,
which acts as a surrogate for a mean flow with a shock-cell structure, leading
to a set of partial differential equations with periodic coefficients in space.
Disturbances are written using the Floquet ansatz and Fourier modes in the
streamwise direction, leading to an eigenvalue problem for the Floquet
exponent. The characteristics of the solution are directly compared to the
locally parallel case, and some of the features are similar. The inclusion of
periodicity induces minor changes in the growth rate and phase velocity of the
relevant modes for small shock amplitudes. On the other hand, the
eigenfunctions are now subject to modulation related to the periodicity of the
flow. Analysis of the spatio-temporal growth rates led to the identification of
a saddle point between the Kelvin-Helmholtz mode and the guided jet mode,
characterising an absolute instability mechanism. Frequencies and mode shapes
related to the saddle points for two conditions (associated with axisymmetric
and helical modes) are compared with screech frequencies and the most energetic
coherent structures of screeching jets, resulting in a good agreement for both.
The analysis shows that a periodic shock-cell structure has an impulse response
that grows upstream, leading to oscillator behaviour. The results suggest that
screech can occur in the absence of a nozzle, and that the upstream reflection
condition is not essential for screech frequency selection. Connections to
previous models are also discussed.

tempting to combine standard microfoundations of rational agents with the

that a direct combination of these standard ingredients leads to brittle
solution concepts of limited descriptive and prescriptive value. First, we show
that rational agents with perfect information produce discontinuities in the
aggregate response to a decision rule that we often do not observe empirically.
Second, when any positive fraction of agents is not perfectly strategic,
desirable stable points -- where the classifier is optimal for the data it
entails -- cease to exist. Third, optimal decision rules under standard
microfoundations maximize a measure of negative externality known as social
burden within a broad class of possible assumptions about agent behavior.
  Recognizing these limitations we explore alternatives to standard
microfoundations for binary classification. We start by describing a set of
desiderata that help navigate the space of possible assumptions about how
agents respond to a decision rule. In particular, we analyze a natural
constraint on feature manipulations, and discuss properties that are sufficient
to guarantee the robust existence of stable points. Building on these insights,
we then propose the noisy response model. Inspired by smoothed analysis and
empirical observations, noisy response incorporates imperfection in the agent
responses, which we show mitigates the limitations of standard
microfoundations. Our model retains analytical tractability, leads to more
robust insights about stable points, and imposes a lower social burden at
optimality.

(CSPs) is the geometry of the space of satisfying or almost satisfying

parallel, there has been a recent flurry of work on refuting random constraint
satisfaction problems, via nailing refutation thresholds for spectral and
semidefinite programming-based algorithms, and also on counting solutions to
CSPs. Inspired by this, the starting point for our work is the following
question: what does the solution space for a random CSP look like to an
efficient algorithm?
  In pursuit of this inquiry, we focus on the following problems about random
Boolean CSPs at the densities where they are unsatisfiable but no refutation
algorithm is known.
  1. Counts. For every Boolean CSP we give algorithms that with high
probability certify a subexponential upper bound on the number of solutions. We
also give algorithms to certify a bound on the number of large cuts in a
Gaussian-weighted graph, and the number of large independent sets in a random
$d$-regular graph.
  2. Clusters. For Boolean $3$CSPs we give algorithms that with high
probability certify an upper bound on the number of clusters of solutions.
  3. Balance. We also give algorithms that with high probability certify that
there are no ""unbalanced"" solutions, i.e., solutions where the fraction of
$+1$s deviates significantly from $50\%$.
  Finally, we also provide hardness evidence suggesting that our algorithms for
counting are optimal.

advantage that informative measurements (non-constant channels) provide in QSB
(nQSB) is exactly characterised by Arimoto's $\alpha$-mutual information, with
the order $\alpha$ determining the risk aversion of the gambler. More
generally, we show that Arimoto-type information-theoretic quantities
characterise the advantage that resourceful objects offer at playing quantum
betting tasks when compared to resourceless objects, for general quantum
resource theories (QRTs) of measurements, channels, states, and
state-measurement pairs, with arbitrary resources. In limiting cases, we show
that QSB (QCB) recovers the known tasks of quantum state (channel)
discrimination when $\alpha \rightarrow \infty$, and quantum state (channel)
exclusion when $\alpha \rightarrow -\infty$. Inspired by these connections, we
also introduce new quantum R\'enyi divergences for measurements, and derive a
new family of resource monotones for the QRT of measurement informativeness.
This family of resource monotones recovers in the same limiting cases as above,
the generalised robustness and the weight of informativeness. Altogether, these
results establish a broad and continuous family of four-way correspondences
between operational tasks, mutual information measures, quantum R\'enyi
divergences, and resource monotones, that can be seen to generalise two
limiting correspondences that were recently discovered for the QRT of
measurement informativeness.

considered a major threat to the security of cryptographic schemes. This has
elevated the need for improved designs by embodying countermeasures, with
masking being the most prominent example. To formally verify the security of a
masking scheme, numerous attack models have been developed to capture the
physical properties of the information leakage as well as the capabilities of
the adversary. With regard to these models, extensive research has been
performed to realize masking schemes. These research efforts have led to
significant progress in the development of security assessment methodologies
and further initiated standardization activities. However, since the majority
of this work is theoretical, it is challenging for the more practice-oriented
hardware security community to fully grasp and contribute to. To bridge the
gap, these advancements are reviewed and discussed in this survey, mainly from
the perspective of hardware security. In doing so, a clear taxonomy is provided
that is helpful for a systematic treatment of the masking-related topics. By
giving an extensive overview of the existing methods, this survey (1) provides
a research landscape of circuit masking for newcomers to the field, (2) offers
guidelines on which attack model and verification tool to choose when designing
masking schemes, and (3) identifies interesting new research directions where
masking models and assessment tools can be applied. Thus, this survey serves as
an essential reference for hardware security practitioners interested in the
theory behind masking techniques, the tools useful to verify the security of
masked circuits, and their potential applications.

vast majority of past reports, the equilibrium location of the dopant in the
Na$_{1-x}$CoO$_2$'s complex layered lattice has not been confidently

for enhancing Na$_{1-x}$CoO$_2$'s figure of merit is yet to be established.
Here, by examining the formation energy of Gd and Yb dopants in
Na$_{0.75}$CoO$_2$ and Na$_{0.50}$CoO$_2$, we demonstrate that in an oxygen
poor environment, Gd and Yb dopants reside in the Na layer while in an oxygen
rich environment these dopants replace a Co in CoO$_2$ layer. When at Na layer,
Gd and Yb dopants reduce the carrier concentration via electron-hole
recombination, simultaneously increasing the Seebeck coefficient ($S$) and
reducing electric conductivity ($\sigma$). Na site doping, however, improves
the thermoelectric power factor (PF) only in Na$_{0.50}$CoO$_2$. When replacing
a Co, these dopants reduce $S$ and PF. The results demonstrate how
thermoelectric performance critically depends on the synthesis environment that
must be fine-tuned for achieving any thermoelectric enhancement.

the wild are of the complex geometric layouts. Existing mainstream methods
follow the instance segmentation pipeline to obtain the text regions. However,
arbitraryshaped texts are difficult to be depicted through one single
segmentation network because of the varying scales. In this paper, we propose a
two-stage segmentation-based detector, termed as NASK (Need A Second looK), for
arbitrary-shaped text detection. Compared to the traditional single-stage
segmentation network, our NASK conducts the detection in a coarse-to-fine
manner with the first stage segmentation spotting the rectangle text proposals
and the second one retrieving compact representations. Specifically, NASK is
composed of a Text Instance Segmentation (TIS) network (1st stage), a
Geometry-aware Text RoI Alignment (GeoAlign) module, and a Fiducial pOint
eXpression (FOX) module (2nd stage). Firstly, TIS extracts the augmented
features with a novel Group Spatial and Channel Attention (GSCA) module and
conducts instance segmentation to obtain rectangle proposals. Then, GeoAlign
converts these rectangles into the fixed size and encodes RoI-wise feature
representation. Finally, FOX disintegrates the text instance into serval
pivotal geometrical attributes to refine the detection results. Extensive
experimental results on three public benchmarks including Total-Text,
SCUTCTW1500, and ICDAR 2015 verify that our NASK outperforms recent

structures for string processing. For a length-$n$ text, however, they use
$\Theta(n \log n)$ bits of space, which is often too costly. To address this,
Grossi and Vitter [STOC 2000] and, independently, Ferragina and Manzini [FOCS
2000] introduced space-efficient versions of the suffix array, known as the
compressed suffix array (CSA) and the FM-index. Sadakane [SODA 2002] then
showed how to augment them to obtain the compressed suffix tree (CST). For a
length-$n$ text over an alphabet of size $\sigma$, these structures use only
$O(n\log\sigma)$ bits. The biggest remaining open question is how efficiently
they can be constructed. After two decades, the fastest algorithms still run in
$O(n)$ time [Hon et al., FOCS 2003], which is $\Theta(\log_{\sigma} n)$ factor
away from the lower bound of $\Omega(n/\log_{\sigma}n)$.
  In this paper, we make the first in 20 years improvement in $n$ for this
problem by proposing a new compressed suffix array and a new compressed suffix
tree which admit $o(n)$-time construction algorithms while matching the space
bounds and the query times of the original CSA/CST and the FM-index. More
precisely, our structures take $O(n\log\sigma)$ bits, support SA queries and
full suffix tree functionality in $O(\log^{\epsilon}n)$ time per operation, and
can be constructed in $O(n \min(1,\log\sigma/\sqrt{\log n}))$ time using
$O(n\log\sigma)$ bits of working space. We derive this result as a corollary
from a much more general reduction: We prove that all parameters of a
compressed suffix array/tree (query time, space, construction time, and
construction working space) can essentially be reduced to those of a data
structure answering new query types that we call prefix rank and prefix
selection. Using the novel techniques, we also develop a new index for pattern
matching.

attention mechanism is proposed with the purpose to solve the problem that the
CS sampling matrices in most cases are random matrices, which are irrelative to
the sampled signal and need a large storage space. The proposed method consists
of three components, i.e., ternary sampling, initial reconstruction and deep
reconstruction, with the emphasis on the ternary sampling. The main idea of the
ternary method (-1, 0, +1) is to introduce the attention mechanism to evaluate
the importance of parameters at the sampling layer after the sampling matrix is
binarized (-1, +1), followed by pruning weight of parameters, whose importance
is below a predefined threshold, to achieve ternarization. Furthermore, a
compressed sensing algorithm especially for image reconstruction is
implemented, on the basis of the ternary sampling matrix, which is called
ATP-Net, i.e., Attention-based ternary projection network. Experimental results
show that the quality of image reconstruction by means of ATP-Net maintains a

collection, it enables data reuse. It is known that policy evaluation
(including multi-step off-policy importance sampling) has the interpretation of
solving a generalized Bellman equation. In this paper, we derive finite-sample
bounds for any general off-policy TD-like stochastic approximation algorithm
that solves for the fixed-point of this generalized Bellman operator. Our key
step is to show that the generalized Bellman operator is simultaneously a
contraction mapping with respect to a weighted $\ell_p$-norm for each $p$ in
$[1,\infty)$, with a common contraction factor.
  Off-policy TD-learning is known to suffer from high variance due to the
product of importance sampling ratios. A number of algorithms (e.g.
$Q^\pi(\lambda)$, Tree-Backup$(\lambda)$, Retrace$(\lambda)$, and $Q$-trace)
have been proposed in the literature to address this issue. Our results
immediately imply finite-sample bounds of these algorithms. In particular, we
provide first-known finite-sample guarantees for $Q^\pi(\lambda)$,
Tree-Backup$(\lambda)$, and Retrace$(\lambda)$, and improve the best known
bounds of $Q$-trace in [19]. Moreover, we show the bias-variance trade-offs in
each of these algorithms.

state-of-the-art deep learning classification models to misclassify.
Understanding and analyzing these adversarial perturbations play a crucial role
in the design of robust convolutional neural networks. However, their mechanics
are not well understood. In this work, we attempt to understand the mechanics
by systematically answering the following question: do imperceptible
adversarial perturbations focus on changing the regions of the image that are
important for classification? In other words, are imperceptible adversarial
perturbations semantically explainable? Most current methods use $l_p$ distance
to generate and characterize the imperceptibility of the adversarial
perturbations. However, since $l_p$ distances only measure the pixel to pixel
distances and do not consider the structure in the image, these methods do not
provide a satisfactory answer to the above question. To address this issue, we
propose a novel framework for generating adversarial perturbations by
explicitly incorporating a ""perceptual quality ball"" constraint in our
formulation. Specifically, we pose the adversarial example generation problem
as a tractable convex optimization problem, with constraints taken from a
mathematically amenable variant of the popular SSIM index. We use the
MobileNetV2 network trained on the ImageNet dataset for our experiments. By
comparing the SSIM maps generated by our method with class activation maps, we
show that the perceptually guided perturbations introduce changes specifically
in the regions that contribute to classification decisions i.e., these
perturbations are semantically explainable.

Completion (RFC), for occluded reID. Different from most previous works that
discard the occluded regions, RFC block can recover the semantics of occluded
regions in feature space. Firstly, a Spatial RFC (SRFC) module is developed.
SRFC exploits the long-range spatial contexts from non-occluded regions to
predict the features of occluded regions. The unit-wise prediction task leads
to an encoder/decoder architecture, where the region-encoder models the
correlation between non-occluded and occluded region, and the region-decoder
utilizes the spatial correlation to recover occluded region features. Secondly,
we introduce Temporal RFC (TRFC) module which captures the long-term temporal
contexts to refine the prediction of SRFC. RFC block is lightweight, end-to-end
trainable and can be easily plugged into existing CNNs to form RFCnet.
Extensive experiments are conducted on occluded and commonly holistic reID

of motion (energy, angular momentum) spaces, counter to expectations of
moving-group stars. We choose the best candidate of the three groups, G21-22,

self-consistently propagate uncertainties from stellar atmosphere solutions in

the G21-22 stars are not chemically homogeneous. Based on the kinematic
analysis for all three groups and the chemical analysis for G21-22, we conclude
the three are not genuine moving groups. The case for G21-22 demonstrates the
benefit of combining kinematic and chemical information in identifying conatal

less dense coronae because most of the input waves dissipate in the lower

Within the limited range of our parameters on magnetic fields and loop lengths,
the EUV and X-ray radiations give a weak impact on the ionization and heating

to produce a novel and comprehensive knowledge graph containing dietary

or Drug-Supplement Interactions (DSI). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created
SemRepDS (an extension of SemRep), capable of extracting semantic relations
from abstracts by leveraging a DS-specific terminology (iDISK) containing
28,884 DS terms not found in the UMLS. PubMed abstracts were processed using
SemRepDS to generate semantic relations, which were then filtered using a
PubMedBERT-based model to remove incorrect relations before generating our
knowledge graph (SuppKG). Two pathways are used to identify potential DS-Drug
interactions which are then evaluated by medical professionals for mechanistic
plausibility. RESULTS: Comparison analysis found that SemRepDS returned 206.9%
more DS relations and 158.5% more DS entities than SemRep. The fine-tuned BERT
model obtained an F1 score of 0.8605 and removed 43.86% of the relations,
improving the precision of the relations by 26.4% compared to pre-filtering.
SuppKG consists of 2,928 DS-specific nodes. Manual review of findings
identified 44 (88%) proposed DS-Gene-Drug and 32 (64%) proposed
DS-Gene1-Function-Gene2-Drug pathways to be mechanistically plausible.
DISCUSSION: The additional relations extracted using SemRepDS generated SuppKG
that was used to find plausible DSI not found in the current literature. By the
nature of the SuppKG, these interactions are unlikely to have been found using
SemRep without the expanded DS terminology. CONCLUSION: We successfully extend
SemRep to include DS information and produce SuppKG which can be used to find
potential DS-Drug interactions.

paper, we address the filtering problem from two aspects, global appearance
restoration for disrupted texture and local coding distortion restoration
caused by fixed pipeline of coding. Accordingly, a three-stream global
appearance and local coding distortion based fusion network is developed with a
high-level global feature stream, a high-level local feature stream and a
low-level local feature stream. Ablation study is conducted to validate the
necessity of different features, demonstrating that the global features and
local features can complement each other in filtering and achieve better
performance when combined. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first one

commodity prices and the need of performing accurate prediction of price
fluctuations, the solution has largely shifted from statistical methods to
machine learning area. However, the selection of proper set from historical
data for forecasting still has limited consideration. On the other hand, when
implementing machine learning techniques, finding a suitable model with optimal
parameters for global solution, nonlinearity and avoiding curse of
dimensionality are still biggest challenges, therefore machine learning
strategies study are needed. In this research, we propose a web-based automated
system to predict agriculture commodity price. In the two series experiments,
five popular machine learning algorithms, ARIMA, SVR, Prophet, XGBoost and LSTM
have been compared with large historical datasets in Malaysia and the most
optimal algorithm, LSTM model with an average of 0.304 mean-square error has
been selected as the prediction engine of the proposed system.

amplitude pressure fluctuations, is driven by a positive coupling between the
unsteady heat release rate and the acoustic field of the combustor. When the
underlying flow is turbulent, as a control parameter of the system is varied
and the system approach thermoacoustic instability, the acoustic pressure
oscillations synchronize with heat release rate oscillations. Consequently,
during the onset of thermoacoustic instability in turbulent combustors, the
system dynamics transition from chaotic oscillations to periodic oscillations
via a state of intermittency. Thermoacoustic systems are traditionally modeled
by coupling the model for the unsteady heat source and the acoustic subsystem,
each estimated independently. The response of the unsteady heat source, the

without introducing any external perturbations, to model their coupled

collecting high-quality labels for supervised learning remains a bottleneck for
many applications. This difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that
state-of-the-art models for NLP tasks are becoming deeper and more complex,
often increasing the amount of training data required even for fine-tuning.
Weak supervision methods, including data programming, address this problem and
reduce the cost of label collection by using noisy label sources for
supervision. However, until recently, data programming was only accessible to
users who knew how to program. To bridge this gap, the Data Programming by
Demonstration framework was proposed to facilitate the automatic creation of
labeling functions based on a few examples labeled by a domain expert. This
framework has proven successful for generating high-accuracy labeling models
for document classification. In this work, we extend the DPBD framework to
span-level annotation tasks, arguably one of the most time-consuming NLP
labeling tasks. We built a novel tool, TagRuler, that makes it easy for
annotators to build span-level labeling functions without programming and
encourages them to explore trade-offs between different labeling models and
active learning strategies. We empirically demonstrated that an annotator could
achieve a higher F1 score using the proposed tool compared to manual labeling
for different span-level annotation tasks.

novel non-parametric graph-based two-sample tests for object data with repeated

alternatives. We derive their asymptotic null distributions under the
permutation null. These tests exhibit substantial power improvements over the
existing methods while controlling the type I errors under finite samples as

area are strongly anti-correlated with each other. The type I radio emission is
believed to arise due to electron beams energized during magnetic reconnection
activity. The observed anti-correlation is interpreted as evidence for presence
of MHD sausage wave modes in the magnetic loops and strands along which these
electron beams are propagating. Our observations suggest that the sites of
these small scale reconnections are distributed along the magnetic flux tube.
We hypothesise that small scale reconnections produces electron beams which

of the YSO distribution with respect to the gas and dust compounds which are

correlation analysis between different gas, dust and YSOs tracers. We compared
the large-scale CO, HCO$^+$, near-IR extinction, and far-IR {\it Herschel} maps
with the density of YSOs of the different evolutionary Classes. The direct
correlation analysis between these maps was used together with the
wavelet-based spatial correlation analysis. This analysis reveals a much
tighter correlation of the gas-dust tracers with the distribution of Class I
YSOs than with that of Class II YSOs. We argue that Class I YSOs which were
initially born in the central bright cluster S255-IR (both N and S parts)
during their evolution to Class II stage ($\sim$2 Myr) had enough time to
travel through the whole S254-S258 star-formation region. Given that the region
contains several isolated YSO clusters, the evolutionary link between these
clusters and the bright central S255-IR (N and S) cluster can be considered.
Despite the complexity of the YSO cluster formation in the non-uniform medium,
the clusters of Class II YSOs in the S254-258 star-formation region can contain
objects born in the different locations of the complex.

Cluster analysis in this context is able to explore given datasets with little

complexity increases in the dimensions volume, variety, and velocity, this
becomes even more important. Many tools for cluster analysis have been
developed from early on and the variety of different clustering algorithms is
huge. As the selection of the right clustering procedure is crucial to the
results of the data analysis, users are in need for support on their journey of
extracting knowledge from raw data. Thus, the objective of this paper lies in
the identification of a systematic selection logic for clustering algorithms
and corresponding validation concepts. The goal is to enable potential users to
choose an algorithm that fits best to their needs and the properties of their
underlying data clustering problem. Moreover, users are supported in selecting
the right validation concepts to make sense of the clustering results. Based on
a comprehensive literature review, this paper provides assessment criteria for
clustering method evaluation and validation concept selection. The criteria are
applied to several common algorithms and the selection process of an algorithm
is supported by the introduction of pseudocode-based routines that consider the

Secondly, many different data schemas are used to encode education credentials,

Consequently, significant manual effort is required to verify credentials.
  In this paper, we tackle these challenges by introducing a decentralized and

transformation information, which enables verifiers to transform credentials
into their preferred schema. Due to the lack of a global root of trust, we
utilize a distributed ledger to build a decentralized web of trust, which
verifiers can query to gather information on the trustworthiness of issuing
institutions and to establish trust in transformation information. Going beyond

for other domains lacking a root of trust and agreements on data schemas.

hybrid rendering method to speed up Monte Carlo rendering algorithms. Our
method first generates two versions of a rendering: one at a low resolution

sample rate (HRLS). We then develop a deep convolutional neural network to fuse
these two renderings into a high-quality image as if it were rendered at a high

as a super resolution problem that generates a high resolution rendering from a
low resolution input (LRHS), assisted with the HRLS rendering. The HRLS
rendering provides critical high frequency details which are difficult to
recover from the LRHS for any super resolution methods. Our experiments show
that our hybrid rendering algorithm is significantly faster than the

paper, we first propose a new metric, degree of delay (DoD), to quantify the
issue of information delay, and characterize DoD for three typical transmission
schemes, i.e., TDMA, beamforming based TDMA (BD-TDMA), and retrospective
interference alignment (RIA). By analyzing DoD in these schemes, its value
mainly depends on three factors, i.e., delay sensitive factor, size of data
set, and queueing delay slot. The first two reflect the relationship between
quality of service (QoS) and information delay sensitivity, and normalize time
cost for each symbol, respectively. These two factors are independent of the
transmission schemes, and thus we aim to reduce the queueing delay slot to
improve DoD. Herein, three novel joint IA schemes are proposed for MIMO
downlink networks with different number of users. That is, hybrid antenna array
based partial interference elimination and retrospective interference
regeneration scheme (HAA-PIE-RIR), HAA based improved PIE and RIR scheme
(HAA-IPIE-RIR), and HAA based cyclic interference elimination and RIR scheme

application scenarios from $2$-user to $K$-user while causing heavy

heterophilic graphs can still be poor. We propose a simple alternative method
that exploits Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD) of topological
structure and node features. Our approach achieves up to ~30% improvement in
performance over state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs. This work is
an early investigation into methods that differ from aggregation based

explore other alternatives to aggregation methods for heterophilic setting.

very different parametrizations of the circulation model induce the same

computational overhead, hampered by the tradition of employing a solitary
quantum processor to handle large-volume data. As such, to better exert the
superiority of VQAs, it is of great significance to improve their runtime
efficiency. Here we devise an efficient distributed optimization scheme, called
QUDIO, to address this issue. Specifically, in QUDIO, a classical central
server partitions the learning problem into multiple subproblems and allocate
them to multiple local nodes where each of them consists of a quantum processor
and a classical optimizer. During the training procedure, all local nodes
proceed parallel optimization and the classical server synchronizes
optimization information among local nodes timely. In doing so, we prove a
sublinear convergence rate of QUDIO in terms of the number of global iteration
under the ideal scenario, while the system imperfection may incur divergent
optimization. Numerical results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that QUDIO
can surprisingly achieve a superlinear runtime speedup with respect to the
number of local nodes. Our proposal can be readily mixed with other advanced
VQAs-based techniques to narrow the gap between the state of the art and

Plasmodium vivax is the most geographically widespread species of malaria.
Relapsing infections, caused by the activation of liver-stage parasites known
as hypnozoites, are a critical feature of the epidemiology of Plasmodium vivax.
Hypnozoites remain dormant in the liver for weeks or months after inoculation,
but cause relapsing infections upon activation. Here, we introduce a dynamic
probability model of the activation-clearance process governing both potential
relapses and the size of the hypnozoite reservoir. We begin by modelling
activation-clearance dynamics for a single hypnozoite using a continuous-time
Markov chain. We then extend our analysis to consider activation-clearance
dynamics for a single mosquito bite, which can simultaneously establish
multiple hypnozoites, under the assumption of independent hypnozoite behaviour.
We derive analytic expressions for the time to first relapse and the time to
hypnozoite clearance for mosquito bites establishing variable numbers of
hypnozoites, both of which are quantities of epidemiological significance. Our
results extend those in the literature, which were limited due to an assumption
of non-independence. Our within-host model can be embedded readily in
multi-scale models and epidemiological frameworks, with analytic solutions
increasing the tractability of statistical inference and analysis. Our work
therefore provides a foundation for further work on immune development and

Navier-Stokes equations are coupled nonlinearly with the dynamical equation of
the disc motion, which synthesizes the fluid-flow boundary conditions and is
driven by the torque exerted by the wall-shear stress. We consider discs that
are fully exposed to the fluid and discs for which only half of the surface
interfaces the fluid. The disc motion is thwarted by the fluid torque in the
housing cavity and by the torque of the ball bearing that supports the disc.
For the full discs, no drag reduction occurs because of the small angular
velocities. The most energetic disc response occurs for disc diameters that are
comparable with the spanwise spacing of the low-speed streaks. A perturbation
analysis for small disc-tip velocities reveals that the two-way nonlinear
coupling has an intense attenuating effect on the disc response. The
reduced-order results show excellent agreement with the nonlinear results for
large diameters. The half discs rotate with a finite angular velocity, leading
to large reduction of the turbulence activity and of the skin-friction drag
over the spinning portion of the discs, while the maximum drag reduction over
the entire walls is 5.6%. The dependence of the drag reduction on the wall-slip
velocity and the spatial distribution of the wall-shear stress qualitatively

  The 1-product of matrices $S_1$, $S_2$ is a matrix whose columns are the
concatenation of each column of $S_1$ with each column of $S_2$. The
$k$-product generalizes the $1$-product, by taking as input two matrices $S_1,
S_2$ together with $k-1$ special rows of each of those matrices, and outputting
a certain composition of $S_1,S_2$.
  Our study is motivated by a close link between the 1-product of matrices and
the Cartesian product of polytopes, and more generally between the $k$-product
of matrices and the glued product of polytopes. These connections rely on the
concept of slack matrix, which gives an algebraic representation of classes of
affinely equivalent polytopes. The slack matrix recognition problem is the
problem of determining whether a given matrix is a slack matrix. This is an
intriguing problem whose complexity is unknown. Our algorithm reduces the
problem to instances which cannot be expressed as $k$-products of smaller
matrices.
  In the second part of the paper, we give a combinatorial interpretation of
$k$-products for two well-known classes of polytopes: 2-level matroid base
polytopes and stable set polytopes of perfect graphs. We also show that the
slack matrix recognition problem is polynomial-time solvable for such
polytopes. Those two classes are special cases of $2$-level polytopes, for
which we conjecture that the slack matrix recognition problem is
polynomial-time solvable.

forgery can generate highly deceptive video contents and bring severe security
threats. And detection of such forgery videos is much more urgent and
challenging. Most existing detection methods treat the problem as a vanilla
binary classification problem. In this paper, the problem is treated as a
special fine-grained classification problem since the differences between fake
and real faces are very subtle. It is observed that most existing face forgery
methods left some common artifacts in the spatial domain and time domain,
including generative defects in the spatial domain and inter-frame
inconsistencies in the time domain. And a spatial-temporal model is proposed
which has two components for capturing spatial and temporal forgery traces in
global perspective respectively. The two components are designed using a novel
long distance attention mechanism. The one component of the spatial domain is
used to capture artifacts in a single frame, and the other component of the
time domain is used to capture artifacts in consecutive frames. They generate
attention maps in the form of patches. The attention method has a broader
vision which contributes to better assembling global information and extracting
local statistic information. Finally, the attention maps are used to guide the
network to focus on pivotal parts of the face, just like other fine-grained
classification methods. The experimental results on different public datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance,
and the proposed long distance attention method can effectively capture pivotal
parts for face forgery.

conjugate that the magnetic field line could connect to these opposite

target zero-resource language (without fine-tuning). However, it is still
unclear how the specific choice of training languages affect downstream
performance. Concretely, here we ask whether it is beneficial to use training

families while controlling for the amount of data per language. In word

GRB-involved binary system and studies the effects of the stellar companion on
the observed GRB emission when it is located inside the jet opening angle.
Assuming a typical emission radius of $\sim10^{15}\,$cm, we show that the
blockage by a companion star with a radius of
$R_\mathrm{c}\sim67\,\mathrm{R_\odot}$ becomes non-negligible when it is
located within a typical GRB jet opening angle (e.g., $\sim10$ degrees) and

GRB with a similar temporal behavior but 25% dimmer. On the other hand, an
off-axis observer outside the jet opening angle (hence missed the original GRB)
can see a delayed ""reflected"" GRB, which is much fainter in brightness, much
wider in the temporal profile and slightly softer in energy. Our study can
naturally explain the origin of some low-luminosity GRBs. Moreover, we also
point out that the companion star may be shocked if it is located inside the

quantitative analysis of radial migration via the calculated migration

distributes three sequences, and clusters in the upper, the middle, and the
lower groups are found to be old outward-migrators, in-situ clusters, and
inward-migrators, respectively. The migration distance increases with age, but
its most effective time is probably less than 3 Gyr. The metallicity gradient
breaks out at $R_g$ (guiding center radius) $\sim11.5$ kpc, which is caused by
the lack of young open clusters in the outer disk and the presence of old
outward-migrators in the upper sequence. It shows that this boundary is related
to the different effects of radial migration between the inner and outer disks.
We also found many special open clusters in and near the outer disk of $R > 11$

Cosine Transform on Channel dimension with Masks (DCT-CM), which intelligently
combines DCT, masks, and a coding format to compress activations. The proposed

that as $|t|$ increases, the models need several levels of the substructure of
gluon density fluctuations in order to describe the measured data well. In lieu
of a perturbative description, we add this substructure by hand. This
substructure is modelled as hotspots within hotspots. This enables us to
describe measurements for $|t|> 1$~GeV$^2$, which is necessary for describing
any observable which integrates over the $t$-spectrum, such as the rapidity or
$W_{\gamma p}$. We find that three levels of proton substructure are adequate
for a good description of all available $ep$ data up to $|t|=30~$GeV$^2$. We
note that the gluonic density fluctuation structure follows a scaling
behaviour, such that the logarithms of the number of hotspots and their size
fall on a line, effectively reducing the available parameter space of the

distribute a computational domain or its mesh, respectively, amongst different
compute units, i.e.~cores or nodes or accelerators. The part of the domain
allocated to each compute unit is called a partition. Besides the balancing of
the work, the communication cost to exchange data between units determines the
quality of a chosen partition. This cost can be approximated by the
surface-to-volume ratio of partitions: the volume represents the amount of
local work, while the surface represents the amount of data to be transmitted.
Empirical evidence suggests that space-filling curves yield advantageous
surface-to-volume ratios. Formal proofs are available only for regular grids.
We investigate the surface-to-volume ratio of space-filling curve partitions
for adaptive grids and derive the maximum surface-to-volume ratio as a function
of the number of cells in the partition. In order to prove our main theorem, we
construct a new framework for the study of adaptive grids, notably introducing
the concepts of a shape and of classified partitions. The new methodological
framework yields insight about the SFC-induced partition character even if the
grids refine rather aggressively in localised areas: it quantifies the obtained
surface-to-volume ratio. This framework thus has the potential to guide the
design of better load balancing algorithms on the long term.

feature detection quality, often failing to stitch images with few features or
low resolution. The learning-based image stitching solutions are rarely studied
due to the lack of labeled data, making the supervised methods unreliable. To
address the above limitations, we propose an unsupervised deep image stitching
framework consisting of two stages: unsupervised coarse image alignment and
unsupervised image reconstruction. In the first stage, we design an
ablation-based loss to constrain an unsupervised homography network, which is
more suitable for large-baseline scenes. Moreover, a transformer layer is
introduced to warp the input images in the stitching-domain space. In the
second stage, motivated by the insight that the misalignments in pixel-level
can be eliminated to a certain extent in feature-level, we design an
unsupervised image reconstruction network to eliminate the artifacts from
features to pixels. Specifically, the reconstruction network can be implemented
by a low-resolution deformation branch and a high-resolution refined branch,
learning the deformation rules of image stitching and enhancing the resolution
simultaneously. To establish an evaluation benchmark and train the learning
framework, a comprehensive real-world image dataset for unsupervised deep image
stitching is presented and released. Extensive experiments well demonstrate the
superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art solutions. Even compared

the central source is the black hole accretion disk. By solving the equation of
motion taking into account the radiation force which is attenuated by the dust

of the optical thickness of the flow and the gas can accrete even if the disk
luminosity exceeds the Eddington luminosity for the dusty-gas, since the
radiation force is weakened by the attenuation via the dust absorption. When
the gas flows in from the direction of the rotation axis for the disk with
${\Gamma}^{'}=3.0$, the accretion rate is about 93% of the Hoyle-Lyttleton
accretion rate if ${\tau}_{\rm{HL}}=3.3$ and zero for ${\tau}_{\rm{HL}}=1.0$,
where ${\Gamma}^{'}$ is the Eddington ratio for the dusty-gas and
${\tau}_{\rm{HL}}$ is the typical optical thickness of the Hoyle-Lyttleton
radius. Since the radiation flux in the direction of disk plane is small, the
radiation force tends not to prevent gas accretion from the direction near the
disk plane. For ${\tau}_{\rm{HL}}=3.3$ and ${\Gamma}^{'}=3.4$, although the
accretion is impossible in the case of ${\Theta}=0$, the accretion rate is 28%
of the Hoyle-Lyttleton one in the case of ${\Theta}=90$, where ${\Theta}$ is
the angle between the direction the gas is coming from and the rotation axis of
the disk. We also obtain relatively high accretion luminosity that is realized
when the accretion rate of the disk onto the BH is consistent with that via the
Hoyle-Lyttleton mechanism taking into account the effect of radiation. This
implies the intermediate-mass black holes moving in the dense dusty-gas are

$\psi_{\rm{DS}}$, which has a mass in the region $940$ MeV/c$^{2} \leq

as well as for the proposed Phase-II Upgrade. We show that the LHCb experiment
can cover the entire mass range of the hypothetical dark baryon.

(CDR) data, a fundamental understanding of their limitations is lacking. In
particular, because of the sparse nature of CDR data, users may travel to a
location without being revealed in the data, which we refer to as a ""hidden
visit"". The existence of hidden visits hinders our ability to extract reliable
information about human mobility and travel behavior from CDR data. In this
study, we propose a data fusion approach to obtain labeled data for statistical
inference of hidden visits. In the absence of complementary data, this can be
accomplished by extracting labeled observations from more granular cellular
data access records, and extracting features from voice call and text messaging
records. The proposed approach is demonstrated using a real-world CDR dataset
of 3 million users from a large Chinese city. Logistic regression, support
vector machine, random forest, and gradient boosting are used to infer whether
a hidden visit exists during a displacement observed from CDR data. The test
results show significant improvement over the naive no-hidden-visit rule, which
is an implicit assumption adopted by most existing studies. Based on the
proposed model, we estimate that over 10% of the displacements extracted from
CDR data involve hidden visits. The proposed data fusion method offers a
systematic statistical approach to inferring individual mobility patterns based

support vector machines, and deep neural networks, utilize surrogate loss
techniques to circumvent the computational complexity of minimizing empirical
classification risk. These techniques are also useful for causal policy
learning problems, since estimation of individualized treatment rules can be
cast as a weighted (cost-sensitive) classification problem. Consistency of the
surrogate loss approaches studied in Zhang (2004) and Bartlett et al. (2006)
crucially relies on the assumption of correct specification, meaning that the
specified set of classifiers is rich enough to contain a first-best classifier.
This assumption is, however, less credible when the set of classifiers is
constrained by interpretability or fairness, leaving the applicability of
surrogate loss based algorithms unknown in such second-best scenarios. This
paper studies consistency of surrogate loss procedures under a constrained set
of classifiers without assuming correct specification. We show that in the
setting where the constraint restricts the classifier's prediction set only,
hinge losses (i.e., $\ell_1$-support vector machines) are the only surrogate
losses that preserve consistency in second-best scenarios. If the constraint
additionally restricts the functional form of the classifier, consistency of a
surrogate loss approach is not guaranteed even with hinge loss. We therefore
characterize conditions for the constrained set of classifiers that can
guarantee consistency of hinge risk minimizing classifiers. Exploiting our
theoretical results, we develop robust and computationally attractive hinge

Semiring semantics generalizes the classical Boolean semantics by permitting
multiple truth values from certain semirings. Evaluating the fixed-point
formula that defines the winning region in a given game in an appropriate
semiring of polynomials provides not only the Boolean information on who wins,
but also tells us how they win and which strategies they might use. This is
well-understood for reachability games, where the winning region is definable
as a least fixed point. The case of B\""uchi games is of special interest, not
only due to their practical importance, but also because it is the simplest
case where the fixed-point definition involves a genuine alternation of a
greatest and a least fixed point.
  We show that, in a precise sense, semiring semantics provide information
about all absorption-dominant strategies -- strategies that win with minimal
effort, and we discuss how these relate to positional and the more general
persistent strategies. This information enables applications such as game
synthesis or determining minimal modifications to the game needed to change its
outcome. Lastly, we discuss limitations of our approach and present questions
that cannot be immediately answered by semiring semantics.

phase noise cancellation techniques, here we introduce a fiber-pigtailed
acousto-optic modulator (AOM) with two diffraction order outputs (0 and +1

the time base effect. Using this technique, we demonstrate transfer of coherent

very high-resolution images where the patch size is much smaller compared to
the full image. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose a
novel framework to segment a particular patch by incorporating contextual
information from its neighboring patches. This allows the segmentation network
to see the target patch with a wider field of view without the need of larger
feature maps. Comparative analysis from a number of experiments shows that our
proposed framework is able to segment high resolution images with significantly
improved mean Intersection over Union and overall accuracy.

reduced to zero without conflicting with the causality bound, the system obeys
universal thermodynamics as observed in a unitary Fermi gas with contact

analyze deep neural networks. The learning dynamics are studied by inspecting
the mutual information (MI) between the hidden layers and the input and output.
Notably, separate fitting and compression phases during training have been
reported. This led to some controversy including claims that the observations
are not reproducible and strongly dependent on the type of activation function
used as well as on the way the MI is estimated. Our study confirms that
different ways of binning when computing the MI lead to qualitatively different
results, either supporting or refusing IB conjectures. To resolve the
controversy, we study the IB principle in settings where MI is non-trivial and
can be computed exactly. We monitor the dynamics of quantized neural networks,
that is, we discretize the whole deep learning system so that no approximation
is required when computing the MI. This allows us to quantify the information
flow without measurement errors. In this setting, we observed a fitting phase
for all layers and a compression phase for the output layer in all experiments;
the compression in the hidden layers was dependent on the type of activation
function. Our study shows that the initial IB results were not artifacts of
binning when computing the MI. However, the critical claim that the compression
phase may not be observed for some networks also holds true.

novel method called Kedge for explicitly sparsifying the underlying graph by
removing unnecessary neighbors. Our key idea is based on a tractable method for
sparsification using the Hard Kumaraswamy distribution that can be used in
conjugation with any GNN model. Kedge learns edge masks in a modular fashion
trained with any GNN allowing for gradient based optimization in an end-to-end
fashion. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our model Kedge can
prune a large proportion of the edges with only a minor effect on the test
accuracy. Specifically, in the PubMed dataset, Kedge learns to drop more than
80% of the edges with an accuracy drop of merely 2% showing that graph
structure has only a small contribution in comparison to node features.
Finally, we also show that Kedge effectively counters the over-smoothing

framework that can serve as a recipe for constructing and analyzing iterative
algorithms for convex optimization. Specifically, our work casts optimization
as iteratively playing a two-player zero-sum game. Many existing optimization
algorithms including Frank-Wolfe and Nesterov's acceleration methods can be
recovered from the game by pitting two online learners with appropriate
strategies against each other. Furthermore, the sum of the weighted average
regrets of the players in the game implies the convergence rate. As a result,
our approach provides simple alternative proofs to these algorithms. Moreover,
we demonstrate that our approach of optimization as iteratively playing a game
leads to three new fast Frank-Wolfe-like algorithms for some constraint sets,
which further shows that our framework is indeed generic, modular, and
easy-to-use.
  In the second part, we develop a modular analysis of provable acceleration
via Polyak's momentum for certain problems, which include solving the classical
strongly quadratic convex problems, training a wide ReLU network under the
neural tangent kernel regime, and training a deep linear network with an
orthogonal initialization. We develop a meta theorem and show that when
applying Polyak's momentum for these problems, the induced dynamics exhibit a
form where we can directly apply our meta theorem.
  In the last part of the dissertation, we show another advantage of the use of
Polyak's momentum -- it facilitates fast saddle point escape in smooth
non-convex optimization. This result, together with those of the second part,
sheds new light on Polyak's momentum in modern non-convex optimization and deep
learning.

up with the players in the cluster that they belong to, and compete against the

The decision of every player is constrained by coupling inequality constraints,
local inequality constraints and local convex set constraints. Our problem
extends well-known noncooperative game problems and resource allocation
problems by considering the competition between clusters and the cooperation
within clusters at the same time. Besides, without involving the resource
allocation within clusters, the noncooperative game between clusters, and the
aforementioned constraints, existing game algorithms as well as resource
allocation algorithms cannot solve the problem. In order to seek the
variational generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) of the multi-cluster games, we
design a distributed algorithm via gradient descent and projections. Moreover,
we analyze the convergence of the algorithm with the help of variational
analysis and Lyapunov stability theory. Under the algorithm, all players
asymptotically converge to the variational GNE of the multi-cluster game.
Simulation examples are presented to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm.

explained with a photoionized low-ionization phase with $\mathrm{[Fe/H]} \sim

high-ionization phase with a conservative lower limit of $-3.3 <

low-metallicity component with a conservative upper limit of $\mathrm{[Fe/H]} <

low-ionization phase may be due to cold-flow accretion via large-scale
filamentary structure or due to recycled accretion while the high-ionization
phase is the result of ancient outflowing material from a nearby galaxy. The
low-metallicity component may come from pristine accretion. The velocity spread

shallow graph convolution networks (GNNs) and temporal extracting modules to
model spatial and temporal dependencies respectively. However, the
representation ability of such models is limited due to: (1) shallow GNNs are
incapable to capture long-range spatial correlations, (2) only spatial

through a tensor-based ordinary differential equation (ODE), as a result,
deeper networks can be constructed and spatial-temporal features are utilized
synchronously. To understand the network more comprehensively, semantical

Distinctive
patterns in communication act as fingerprints, enabling adversaries to
de-anonymise communicating parties or to infer sensitive information. Despite
the attacks being known for decades, practical solution are scarce. Network
layer countermeasures have relied on black box padding schemes that require
significant overheads in latency and bandwidth to mitigate the attacks, without
fundamentally preventing them, and the problem has received little attention in
the language-based information flow literature. Language-based methods provide
a strong foundation for fundamentally addressing security issues, but previous
work has overwhelmingly assumed that interactive programs communicate over
secure channels, where messages are undetectable by unprivileged adversaries.
This assumption is too strong for online communication where packets can be
trivially observed by eavesdropping. In this paper we introduce SELENE, a small
language for principled, provably secure communication over channels where
packets are publicly observable, and we demonstrate how our program level
defence can reduce the latency and bandwidth overheads induced compared with
program-agnostic defence mechanisms. We believe that our results constitute a

multifarious document images (e.g., invoices and purchase receipts). Most
previous methods treat the VIE task simply as a sequence labeling problem or
classification problem, which requires models to carefully identify each kind
of semantics by introducing multimodal features, such as font, color, layout.
But simply introducing multimodal features couldn't work well when faced with
numeric semantic categories or some ambiguous texts. To address this issue, in
this paper we propose a novel key-value matching model based on a graph neural
network for VIE (MatchVIE). Through key-value matching based on relevancy
evaluation, the proposed MatchVIE can bypass the recognitions to various
semantics, and simply focuses on the strong relevancy between entities.
Besides, we introduce a simple but effective operation, Num2Vec, to tackle the
instability of encoded values, which helps model converge more smoothly.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MatchVIE can
significantly outperform previous methods. Notably, to the best of our
knowledge, MatchVIE may be the first attempt to tackle the VIE task by modeling
the relevancy between keys and values and it is a good complement to the
existing methods.

capabilities of TESs in electron spectroscopy, a simulation pipeline has been
devised. The pipeline allows the results of a simulated experiment to be

measurement accuracy and efficiency to be studied. Using Fisher information,
the energy resolution of the simulated detectors was also calculated, allowing
the intrinsic limitations of the detector to be separated from the specific

high-precision measurements but have comparable or better resolutions for high

the future movement of the stock price. Recently, machine learning based
solutions have shown their capacity to give more accurate stock prediction and
become indispensable components in modern quantitative investment systems.
However, the i.i.d. assumption behind existing methods is inconsistent with the
existence of diverse trading patterns in the stock market, which inevitably
limits their ability to achieve better stock prediction performance. In this
paper, we propose a novel architecture, Temporal Routing Adaptor (TRA), to
empower existing stock prediction models with the ability to model multiple
stock trading patterns. Essentially, TRA is a lightweight module that consists
of a set of independent predictors for learning multiple patterns as well as a
router to dispatch samples to different predictors. Nevertheless, the lack of
explicit pattern identifiers makes it quite challenging to train an effective
TRA-based model. To tackle this challenge, we further design a learning
algorithm based on Optimal Transport (OT) to obtain the optimal sample to
predictor assignment and effectively optimize the router with such assignment
through an auxiliary loss term. Experiments on the real-world stock ranking
task show that compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, e.g., Attention LSTM

polyatomic (more exactly diatomic) lattice performing out-of-plane motions. The
dynamics of the lattice is described by an infinite system of stochastic
ordinary differential equations with white noise in the right-hand side, which
models the point heat source. On the base of the previous analytical unsteady
analysis an analytical formula in continuum approximation is suggested, which
allows one to describe a steady-state kinetic temperature distribution in the
graphene lattice in continuum approximation. The obtained solution is in a good
agreement with numerical results obtained for the discrete system everywhere
excepting a neighbourhood of six singular rays with the origin at the heat
source location. The continuum solution becomes singular at these rays, unlike
the discrete one, which appears to be localized in a certain sense along the
rays. The factors, which cause such a directional localization and the mismatch
between the continuum and discrete solutions are discussed. We expect that the
suggested formula is applicable for various damped polyatomic lattices where
all particles have equal masses in the case of universal for all particles
external viscosity.

training monocular depth estimation. Although these methods show strong results
on outdoor datasets such as KITTI, they do not match performance of supervised
methods on indoor environments with camera rotation. Indoor, rotated scenes are
common for less constrained applications and pose problems for two reasons:
abundance of low texture regions and increased complexity of depth cues for
images under rotation. In an effort to extend self-supervised learning to more
generalised environments we propose two additions. First, we propose a novel
Filled Disparity Loss term that corrects for ambiguity of image reconstruction
error loss in textureless regions. Specifically, we interpolate disparity in
untextured regions, using the estimated disparity from surrounding textured
areas, and use L1 loss to correct the original estimation. Our experiments show
that depth estimation is substantially improved on low-texture scenes, without
any loss on textured scenes, when compared to Monodepth by Godard et al.
Secondly, we show that training with an application's representative rotations,
in both pitch and roll, is sufficient to significantly improve performance over
the entire range of expected rotation. We demonstrate that depth estimation is
successfully generalised as performance is not lost when evaluated on test sets
with no camera rotation. Together these developments enable a broader use of
self-supervised learning of monocular depth estimation for complex
environments.

that by a proper design of the system parameters and the driving protocol, the

network models for unsupervised machine learning only work as a proof of
principle, as their performance is much worse than the standard models such as
restricted Boltzmann machines and neural networks. In this Letter, we present
autoregressive matrix product states (AMPS), a tensor network model combining
matrix product states from quantum many-body physics and autoregressive
modeling from machine learning. Our model enjoys the exact calculation of
normalized probability and unbiased sampling. We demonstrate the performance of
our model using two applications, generative modeling on synthetic and
real-world data, and reinforcement learning in statistical physics. Using
extensive numerical experiments, we show that the proposed model significantly
outperforms the existing tensor network models and the restricted Boltzmann

problem formulation is based on the sound theoretical framework provided by the
classical statics of shells. After introducing the shell stress tensors on the
dome mid-surface, integral equilibrium equations are enforced for its typical
part. Heyman's assumptions of infinite compressive and vanishing tensile
strengths are made, with cohesionless friction behavior governing the shear
strength, to characterize the admissible stress states in the dome. An original
computational strategy is developed to address the resulting static limit
analysis problem, involving the introduction of a mesh on the dome mid-surface,
the interpolation of the physical components of the shell stress tensors on the
element boundaries, and the imposition of equilibrium and admissibility
conditions respectively for the elements and at the nodes of the mesh. The
descending discrete convex optimization problem is solved by standard and
effective optimization tools, automatically providing collapse multiplier of
horizontal forces, incipient collapse mechanism and expected crack pattern.
Convergence analysis, validation with experimental results available in the
literature, and parametric analyses with respect to geometric parameters and
friction coefficient, are presented for spherical and ellipsoidal masonry

framework executes a user-defined function that generates a slice of the

framework manages the loading and unloading of object segments to ensure that
memory is reclaimed as needed and data is never lost. This allows the UFO
framework to implement larger-than-memory data structures that never
materialize into memory in full. Implementing objects as UFOs also impacts
performance, since overhead of populating memory is amortized by loading entire

significant interest, a clear picture for understanding rates of estimation in

$\sigma \gg 1$ that is highly relevant in applications. Recent investigations
have revealed a remarkable asymptotic sample complexity of order $\sigma^6$ for
certain signals whose Fourier transforms have full support, in stark contrast
to the traditional $\sigma^2$ that arise in regular models. Often prohibitively
large in practice, these results have prompted the investigation of variations
around the MRA model where better sample complexity may be achieved. In this

that is typically applied to problems with a small number of independent
objectives. However, in practice we often wish to optimize objectives defined
over many correlated outcomes (or ""tasks""). For example, scientists may want to
optimize the coverage of a cell tower network across a dense grid of locations.
Similarly, engineers may seek to balance the performance of a robot across
dozens of different environments via constrained or robust optimization.
However, the Gaussian Process (GP) models typically used as probabilistic
surrogates for multi-task Bayesian Optimization scale poorly with the number of
outcomes, greatly limiting applicability. We devise an efficient technique for
exact multi-task GP sampling that combines exploiting Kronecker structure in
the covariance matrices with Matheron's identity, allowing us to perform
Bayesian Optimization using exact multi-task GP models with tens of thousands
of correlated outputs. In doing so, we achieve substantial improvements in
sample efficiency compared to existing approaches that only model aggregate
functions of the outcomes. We demonstrate how this unlocks a new class of
applications for Bayesian Optimization across a range of tasks in science and
engineering, including optimizing interference patterns of an optical
interferometer with more than 65,000 outputs.

such as extreme weather early warning and long-term energy consumption
planning. This paper studies the long-term forecasting problem of time series.
Prior Transformer-based models adopt various self-attention mechanisms to
discover the long-range dependencies. However, intricate temporal patterns of
the long-term future prohibit the model from finding reliable dependencies.
Also, Transformers have to adopt the sparse versions of point-wise
self-attentions for long series efficiency, resulting in the information
utilization bottleneck. Going beyond Transformers, we design Autoformer as a
novel decomposition architecture with an Auto-Correlation mechanism. We break
with the pre-processing convention of series decomposition and renovate it as a
basic inner block of deep models. This design empowers Autoformer with
progressive decomposition capacities for complex time series. Further, inspired
by the stochastic process theory, we design the Auto-Correlation mechanism
based on the series periodicity, which conducts the dependencies discovery and
representation aggregation at the sub-series level. Auto-Correlation
outperforms self-attention in both efficiency and accuracy. In long-term
forecasting, Autoformer yields state-of-the-art accuracy, with a 38% relative
improvement on six benchmarks, covering five practical applications: energy,
traffic, economics, weather and disease. Code is available at this repository:

developers need to ensure that the app properly checks and requests required
permissions before invoking any permission-protected APIs. Second, Android's
permission mechanism keeps evolving and getting customized by device
manufacturers. Developers are expected to comprehensively test their apps on
different Android versions and device models to make sure permissions are
properly requested in all situations. Unfortunately, these requirements are

various runtime permission issues (ARP issues).
  While existing studies have explored ARP issues, the understanding of such
issues is still preliminary. To better characterize ARP issues, we performed an
empirical study using 135 Stack Overflow posts that discuss ARP issues and 199

galaxy cluster. We aim to study the relative importance and efficiency of
processes such as ram-pressure stripping and tidal interactions as well as
their dependency on the local and global environment of galaxies in the cluster

H$\,$I spectral line imaging survey with the MeerKAT radio telescope of a

have used the CARAcal pipeline to reduce the data, SoFiA to detect sources
within the H$\,$I data cube, and GIPSY to construct spatially resolved
information on the H$\,$I morphologies and kinematics of the H$\,$I detected
galaxies. We have detected H$\,$I in 219 galaxies with optical counterparts
within the entire surveyed volume. We present the H$\,$I properties of each of
the detected galaxies as a data catalogue and as an atlas page for each galaxy,
including H$\,$I column-density maps, velocity fields, position-velocity

studies of identified ``jellyfish'' galaxies and galaxy population studies by

background reconstruction. Through integrating both processes into a single
network, previous methods provide an implicit erasure guidance by modifying all
pixels in the entire image. However, there exists two problems: 1) the implicit
erasure guidance causes the excessive erasure to non-text areas; 2) the
one-stage erasure lacks the exhaustive removal of text region. In this paper,
we propose a ProgrEssively Region-based scene Text eraser (PERT), introducing
an explicit erasure guidance and performing balanced multi-stage erasure for
accurate and exhaustive text removal. Firstly, we introduce a new region-based
modification strategy (RegionMS) to explicitly guide the erasure process.
Different from previous implicitly guided methods, RegionMS performs targeted
and regional erasure on only text region, and adaptively perceives stroke-level
information to improve the integrity of non-text areas with only bounding box
level annotations. Secondly, PERT performs balanced multi-stage erasure with
several progressive erasing stages. Each erasing stage takes an equal step
toward the text-erased image to ensure the exhaustive erasure of text regions.
Compared with previous methods, PERT outperforms them by a large margin without
the need of adversarial loss, obtaining SOTA results with high speed (71 FPS)
and at least 25% lower parameter complexity. Code is available at

After that, they are fine-tuned on a specific task. Applications then use these
models for inference, and often some additional constraints apply, like low
power-budget or low latency between input and output. The main avenue to meet
these additional requirements for the inference settings, is to use low
precision computation (e.g. INT8 rather than FP32), but this comes with a cost
of deteriorating the functional performance (e.g. accuracy) of the model. Some
approaches have been developed to tackle the problem and go beyond the
limitations of the PTO (Post-Training Quantization), more specifically the QAT
(Quantization Aware Training, see [4]) is a procedure that interferes with the
training process in order to make it affected (or simply disturbed) by the
quantization phase during the training itself. Besides QAT, recently
Intel-Habana Labs have proposed an additional and more direct way to make the
training results more robust to subsequent quantization which uses a
regularizer, therefore changing the loss function that drives the training
procedure. But their proposal does not work out-of-the-box for pre-trained

changes the radiation pattern of a single fluorescent bead and it beams light

Moreover, the collected signal compared to the case of a glass coverslip is
larger than a factor of 3, which is mainly due to the excitation enhancement.

challenge in computer vision and graphics. Recently, an unsupervised learning
approach has garnered considerable attention owing to its advantages in data
collection. However, to mitigate training limitations, typical methods need to
impose assumptions for viewpoint distribution (e.g., a dataset containing
various viewpoint images) or object shape (e.g., symmetric objects). These
assumptions often restrict applications; for instance, the application to
non-rigid objects or images captured from similar viewpoints (e.g., flower or
bird images) remains a challenge. To complement these approaches, we propose
aperture rendering generative adversarial networks (AR-GANs), which equip
aperture rendering on top of GANs, and adopt focus cues to learn the depth and
depth-of-field (DoF) effect of unlabeled natural images. To address the
ambiguities triggered by unsupervised setting (i.e., ambiguities between smooth
texture and out-of-focus blurs, and between foreground and background blurs),
we develop DoF mixture learning, which enables the generator to learn real
image distribution while generating diverse DoF images. In addition, we devise
a center focus prior to guiding the learning direction. In the experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of AR-GANs in various datasets, such as flower,
bird, and face images, demonstrate their portability by incorporating them into
other 3D representation learning GANs, and validate their applicability in
shallow DoF rendering.

velocity increments, structure functions and their scaling exponents, drift and
diffusion coefficients of the Fokker-Planck equation and consequently the total
entropy production of the turbulent cascade. As a precondition for the
stochastic process approach, Markovian properties of the turbulent cascade in
scale are tested. The knowledge of a Fokker-Planck equation allows to determine
for each independent cascade trajectories a total entropy production. The
estimation of total entropy production allows to verify a rigorous law of
non-equilibrium stochastic thermodynamics, namely the integral fluctuation
theorem, which must be valid if Markov properties hold and the Fokker-Planck
equation is correct. This approach to the turbulent cascade process has the
potential for a new way to link the statistical description of turbulence,

last three years, with the emergence of end-to-end neural approaches. Spoken
language understanding refers to natural language processing tasks related to
semantic extraction from speech signal, like named entity recognition from
speech or slot filling task in a context of human-machine dialogue.
Classically, SLU tasks were processed through a cascade approach that consists
in applying, firstly, an automatic speech recognition process, followed by a
natural language processing module applied to the automatic transcriptions.
These three last years, end-to-end neural approaches, based on deep neural
networks, have been proposed in order to directly extract the semantics from
speech signal, by using a single neural model. More recent works on
self-supervised training with unlabeled data open new perspectives in term of
performance for automatic speech recognition and natural language processing.
In this paper, we present a brief overview of the recent advances on the French
MEDIA benchmark dataset for SLU, with or without the use of additional data. We
also present our last results that significantly outperform the current
state-of-the-art with a Concept Error Rate (CER) of 11.2%, instead of 13.6% for
the last state-of-the-art system presented this year.

that the self-coupling effects suppress the magnitude of the scalarization and
thus reduce the amplitude of the associated gravitational wave signals. In
addition, the self-interacting effects in the gravitational waveform are shown
to be negligible due to the dispersion throughout the astrophysically distant
propagation. As a consequence, the gravitational waves observed on the Earth
feature the characteristic inverse-chirp pattern. Although not with the
on-going ground-based detectors, we illustrate that the scalarization-induced
gravitational waves may be detectable at a signal-to-noise ratio level of
${\cal O}(100)$ with future detectors, such as Einstein Telescope and Cosmic
Explorer.

$\Omega(n)$ space. The key technical core is an optimal,
$q^{-(k-1)}$-inapproximability for the \textsf{Max $k$-LIN}-$\bmod\; q$
problem, which is the Max CSP problem where every constraint is given by a
system of $k-1$ linear equations $\bmod\; q$ over $k$ variables. Our work
builds on and extends the breakthrough work of Kapralov and Krachun (Proc. STOC

MaxCut problem in graphs. MaxCut corresponds roughly to the case of \textsf{Max

prior results only yielded $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ space bounds. In particular no

research efforts have been made, the state-of-the-art bot detection methods
fall short of generalizability and adaptability. Specifically, previous bot
detectors leverage only a small fraction of user information and are often
trained on datasets that only cover few types of bots. As a result, they fail
to generalize to real-world scenarios on the Twittersphere where different
types of bots co-exist. Additionally, bots in Twitter are constantly evolving
to evade detection. Previous efforts, although effective once in their context,
fail to adapt to new generations of Twitter bots. To address the two challenges
of Twitter bot detection, we propose SATAR, a self-supervised representation
learning framework of Twitter users, and apply it to the task of bot detection.
In particular, SATAR generalizes by jointly leveraging the semantics, property
and neighborhood information of a specific user. Meanwhile, SATAR adapts by
pre-training on a massive number of self-supervised users and fine-tuning on
detailed bot detection scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SATAR
outperforms competitive baselines on different bot detection datasets of
varying information completeness and collection time. SATAR is also proved to
generalize in real-world scenarios and adapt to evolving generations of social

allows lighting estimation in both frequency domain and spatial domain jointly.
An optimal thresholding function is designed to achieve sparse needlets which

significant role in the synthesis of light elements in the primordial
nucleosynthesis as well as in the interior of compact stellar objects. Many
different kinds of nuclear reactions are occurring simultaneously inside the
stellar core depending upon the density and temperature conditions of the
nuclear plasma along with other relevant parameters of these stars. Nuclear
fusion reactions in the energy range ($E\sim$ 1 eV to few keV) can be explained
successfully by quantum mechanical tunneling through the mutual Coulomb barrier
of interacting nuclei. The measurement of the cross-sections at extremely low
energy is quite difficult because of the larger width of the Coulomb barrier,
which results in a very small value of the reaction cross-section. Hence, any
improvement in the data on astrophysical S-factors for the light nuclei fusion
may give a better picture of the elemental abundance in nucleosynthesis. In
this work, we have theoretically investigated the energy dependence of fusion
cross-sections and astrophysical S-factors for fusion reaction of light nuclei
like D-D and p-$^{11}$B using complex Gaussian nuclear potential with
adjustable depth and range parameters plus the mutual Coulomb interaction of
the interacting nuclei. Numerical computation of the observables is done in the
framework of the selective resonant tunneling model approach. The results of
our calculation are compared with those found in the literature.

propose BotRGCN, which is short for Bot detection with Relational Graph
Convolutional Networks. BotRGCN addresses the challenge of community by
constructing a heterogeneous graph from follow relationships and applies
relational graph convolutional networks. Apart from that, BotRGCN makes use of
multi-modal user semantic and property information to avoid feature engineering
and augment its ability to capture bots with diversified disguise. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BotRGCN outperforms competitive baselines on a
comprehensive benchmark TwiBot-20 which provides follow relationships.

case-critical applications, raising faithful and ethical concerns that lead to
trust crises. One possible way to mitigate this issue is to understand how a
(mispredicted) decision is carved out from the decision boundary. This paper
presents a human-in-the-loop approach to explain machine learning models using
verbatim neighborhood manifestation. Contrary to most of the current
eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) systems, which provide hit-or-miss
approximate explanations, our approach generates the local decision boundary of
the given instance and enables human intelligence to conclude the model
behavior. Our method can be divided into three stages: 1) a neighborhood
generation stage, which generates instances based on the given sample; 2) a
classification stage, which yields classifications on the generated instances
to carve out the local decision boundary and delineate the model behavior; and
3) a human-in-the-loop stage, which involves human to refine and explore the
neighborhood of interest. In the generation stage, a generative model is used
to generate the plausible synthetic neighbors around the given instance. After
the classification stage, the classified neighbor instances provide a
multifaceted understanding of the model behavior. Three intervention points are
provided in the human-in-the-loop stage, enabling humans to leverage their own
intelligence to interpret the model behavior. Several experiments on two
datasets are conducted, and the experimental results demonstrate the potential
of our proposed approach for boosting human understanding of the complex

activity is found to be linked to an impulsive event occurring some $\pm$10
days around perihelion, probably due to a collision or a rotational disruption.
Its orbit is stable over 100 Myr timescales. Dust tail models reveal a
short-term burst producing (2.0$\pm$0.7)$\times$10$^6$ kg of dust for maximum
particle radius rmax=1 cm. The spectrum of P/2019 A4 is featureless, and
slightly redder than the Sun. P/2021 A5 was active $\sim$50 days after
perihelion, lasting $\sim$5 to $\sim$60 days, and ejecting
(8$\pm$2)$\times$10$^6$ kg of dust for rmax=1 cm. The orbital simulations show
that a few percent of dynamical clones of P/2021 A5 are unstable on 20-50 Myr
timescales. Thus, P/2021 A5 might be an implanted object from the JFC region or
beyond. These facts point to water ice sublimation as the activation mechanism.
This object also displays a featureless spectrum, but slightly bluer than the
Sun. Nuclei sizes are estimated in the few hundred meters range for both

the past decade, which has afforded in-depth data-based research. By learning
from the large amount of healthcare data, various data-driven models have been
built to predict future events for different medical tasks, such as auto
diagnosis and heart-attack prediction. Although EHR is abundant, the population
that satisfies specific criteria for learning population-specific tasks is
scarce, making it challenging to train data-hungry deep learning models. This
study presents the Claim Pre-Training (Claim-PT) framework, a generic
pre-training model that first trains on the entire pediatric claims dataset,
followed by a discriminative fine-tuning on each population-specific task. The
semantic meaning of medical events can be captured in the pre-training stage,
and the effective knowledge transfer is completed through the task-aware
fine-tuning stage. The fine-tuning process requires minimal parameter
modification without changing the model architecture, which mitigates the data
scarcity issue and helps train the deep learning model adequately on small
patient cohorts. We conducted experiments on a real-world claims dataset with
more than one million patient records. Experimental results on two downstream
tasks demonstrated the effectiveness of our method: our general task-agnostic
pre-training framework outperformed tailored task-specific models, achieving
more than 10\% higher in model performance as compared to baselines. In
addition, our framework showed a great generalizability potential to transfer
learned knowledge from one institution to another, paving the way for future
healthcare model pre-training across institutions.

further adopt a generative adversarial imitation learning framework to learn
the model parameters. In comparison with the traditional likelihood-based

an intensity function, which alleviates the model-misspecification. Moreover,
the adversarial learning procedure bypasses the difficult-to-evaluate integral
involved in the likelihood evaluation, which makes the model inference more
scalable with the data and variables. We showcase the dynamic learning
performance on the COVID-19 confirmed cases in the U.S. and evaluate the social

some others present a lack of it. Whether bars with low level of SF are a
consequence of low star formation efficiency (SFE), low gas inflow rate, or
dynamical effects, remains a matter of debate. We perform a multi-wavelength
analysis of 12 strongly barred massive galaxies, chosen to host different
degrees of SF along the bar major axis without any prior condition on gas
content. We observe the CO(1-0) and CO(2-1) emission within bars with the
IRAM-30m telescope, which we use to estimate molecular gas masses. SF rates
(SFR) are calculated from GALEX near- and far- ultraviolet (UV) and WISE 12 and
22 micron images within the beam pointings, covering the full bar extent. We
detect molecular gas along the bars of all probed galaxies. The SFE in bars
varies between galaxies by up to an order of magnitude. On average, SFEs are
roughly constant along bars. SFEs are not significantly different from the mean
value in spiral galaxies reported in the literature. Interestingly, the higher
the total stellar mass of the host galaxy, the lower the SFE within their bars.
In particular, the two galaxies in our sample with lowest SFEs and SFR surface
densities (NGC 4548 and NGC 5850) are also the ones hosting massive bulges and
signs of past interactions with nearby companions. The SFE in strong bars is
not systematically inhibited (either in the central, mid- or end-parts of the
bar). Both environmental and internal quenching are likely responsible for the
lowest SFEs reported in this work (Abridged).

candidates, BaCo2(AsO4)2, was revisited recently. The long range magnetic order

suggesting its proximity to Kitaev QSL. Here we perform time domain terahertz
spectroscopy measurement to study the magnetic excitations on BaCo2(AsO4)2. We
observe different magnon excitations upon increasing external magnetic field.
In particular, the system is easily driven to a field-polarized paramagnetic
phase, after the long range magnetic order is suppressed by a weak field Hc 2.
The spectra beyond Hc2 are dominated by single magnon and two magnon

either more efficient quenching mechanisms in group cores at lower redshift or

premise, we propose a framework for combining skills using the formalism of
options. We show that every deterministic option can be unambiguously
represented as a cumulant defined in an extended domain. Building on this
insight and on previous results on transfer learning, we show how to
approximate options whose cumulants are linear combinations of the cumulants of
known options. This means that, once we have learned options associated with a
set of cumulants, we can instantaneously synthesise options induced by any
linear combination of them, without any learning involved. We describe how this

double hybrid) and basis sets on over 2,000 TMCs. Although computed properties
(e.g., spin-state ordering and frontier orbital gap) naturally differ by DFA,
high linear correlations persist across all DFAs. We train independent ML
models for each DFA and observe convergent trends in feature importance; these
features thus provide DFA-invariant, universal design rules. We devise a
strategy to train ML models informed by all 23 DFAs and use them to predict
properties (e.g., spin-splitting energy) of over 182k TMCs. By requiring
consensus of the ANN-predicted DFA properties, we improve correspondence of
these computational lead compounds with literature-mined, experimental
compounds over the single-DFA approach typically employed. Both feature
analysis and consensus-based ML provide efficient, alternative paths to
overcome accuracy limitations of practical DFT.

that describes the asymptotic behaviour of properly renormalised maxima of a
sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables. If the
shape parameter $\xi$ is zero, the GEV distribution has unbounded support,
whereas if $\xi$ is positive, the limiting distribution is heavy-tailed with
infinite upper endpoint but finite lower endpoint. In practical applications,
we assume that the GEV family is a reasonable approximation for the
distribution of maxima over blocks, and we fit it accordingly. This implies
that GEV properties, such as finite lower endpoint in the case $\xi>0$, are
inherited by the finite-sample maxima, which might not have bounded support.
This is particularly problematic when predicting extreme observations based on
multiple and interacting covariates. To tackle this usually overlooked issue,
we propose a blended GEV distribution, which smoothly combines the left tail of
a Gumbel distribution (GEV with $\xi=0$) with the right tail of a Fr\'echet
distribution (GEV with $\xi>0$) and, therefore, has unbounded support. Using a
Bayesian framework, we reparametrise the GEV distribution to offer a more
natural interpretation of the (possibly covariate-dependent) model parameters.
Independent priors over the new location and spread parameters induce a joint
prior distribution for the original location and scale parameters. We introduce
the concept of property-preserving penalised complexity (P$^3$C) priors and
apply it to the shape parameter to preserve first and second moments. We
illustrate our methods with an application to NO$_2$ pollution levels in
California, which reveals the robustness of the bGEV distribution, as well as
the suitability of the new parametrisation and the P$^3$C prior framework.

the characteristics of the high redshift galaxy population. Many of the
astrophysical properties of galaxies at high redshifts are currently
unconstrained due to the lack of observations. This creates a vast space of
possible astrophysical scenarios where the 21-cm signal needs to be modeled in
order to plan for, and eventually fit, future observations. This is done with
fast numerical methods which make simplifying approximations for the underlying
physical processes. In this work we quantify the effect of Poisson fluctuations
and scatter in the star formation efficiency; while Poisson fluctuations are
included in some works and not in others, scatter in the star formation
efficiency is usually neglected, and all galaxies of a given mass are assumed
to have the same properties. We show that both features can have a significant
effect on the 21-cm power spectrum, most importantly in scenarios where the
signal is dominated by massive galaxies. Scatter in the star formation
efficiency does not simply enhance the effect of Poisson fluctuations; for
example we show that the power spectrum shape at cosmic dawn has a feature
corresponding to the width of the galaxy brightness distribution. We also
discuss some of the consequences for 21-cm imaging, and the signature of
reduced correlation between the density and radiation fields.

Unlike self-attention that focuses on global dependency modeling at a coarse

our VOLO achieves 87.1% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K classification, which is

analysis of terrestrial and planetary environments and atmospheres, but their
study relies on understanding the small-scale dynamics that constantly generate
new dunes and reshape older ones. Here we designed a landscape-scale experiment
at the edge of the Gobi desert, China, to quantify the development of incipient
dunes under the natural action of winds. High-resolution topographic data
documenting 42~months of bedform dynamics are examined to provide a spectral
analysis of dune pattern formation. We identified two successive phases in the
process of dune growth, from the initial flat sand bed to a meter-high periodic
pattern. We focus on the initial phase, when the linear regime of dune
instability applies, and measure the growth rate of dunes of different
wavelengths. We identify the existence of a maximum growth rate, which readily
explains the mechanism by which dunes select their size, leading to the
prevalence of a 15~m-wavelength pattern. We quantitatively compare our
experimental results to the prediction of the dune instability theory using
transport and flow parameters independently measured in the field. The
remarkable agreement between theory and observations demonstrates that the
linear regime of dune growth is permanently expressed on low-amplitude bed
topography, before larger regular patterns and slip faces eventually emerge.
Our experiment underpin existing theoretical models for the early development
of eolian dunes, which can now be used to provide reliable insights into
atmospheric and surface processes on Earth and other planetary bodies.

ignore the noisy client issue, which may harm the overall performance of the
shared model. We first investigate critical issue caused by noisy clients in FL
and quantify the negative impact of the noisy clients in terms of the

observations: (1) the noisy clients can severely impact the convergence and
performance of the global model in FL, and (2) the noisy clients can induce
greater bias in the deeper layers than the former layers of the global model.
Based on the above observations, we propose Fed-NCL, a framework that conducts
robust federated learning with noisy clients. Specifically, Fed-NCL first
identifies the noisy clients through well estimating the data quality and model
divergence. Then robust layer-wise aggregation is proposed to adaptively
aggregate the local models of each client to deal with the data heterogeneity
caused by the noisy clients. We further perform the label correction on the
noisy clients to improve the generalization of the global model. Experimental
results on various datasets demonstrate that our algorithm boosts the

this paper introduces two novel iterative methods for efficiently solving the
multiperiod optimal electricity and gas flow (MOEGF) problem. The first is an
iterative MILP-based method and the second is an iterative LP-based method with
an elaborate procedure for ensuring an integral solution. The convergence of
the two approaches is founded on two key features. The first is a penalty term
with a single, automatically tuned, parameter for controlling the step size of
the gas network iterates. The second is a sequence of supporting hyperplanes
together with an increasing number of carefully constructed halfspaces for
controlling the convergence of the electricity network iterates. Moreover, the
two proposed algorithms use as a warm start the solution from a novel
polyhedral relaxation of the MOEGF problem, for a noticeable improvement in
computation time as compared to a cold start. Unlike the first method, which
invokes a branch-and-bound algorithm to find an integral solution, the second
method implements an elaborate steering procedure that guides the continuous
variables to take integral values at the solution. Numerical evaluation
demonstrates that the two proposed methods can converge to high-quality
feasible solutions in computation times at least two orders of magnitude faster
than both a state-of-the-art nonlinear branch-and-bound (NLBB) MINLP solver and
a mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) relaxation of the MOEGF problem. The
experimental setup consists of five test cases, three of which involve the real
electricity and gas transmission networks of the state of Victoria with actual

one makes use of empirical data to test a hypothesis and often emit a judgment
about whether to reject it or not. In this paper we focus on the logical aspect
of this strategy, which is largely independent of the adopted school of
thought, at least within the various frequentist approaches. We identify SHT as
taking the form of an unsound argument from Modus Tollens in classical logic,
and, in order to rescue SHT from this difficulty, we propose that it can
instead be grounded in t-norm based fuzzy logics. We reformulate the
frequentists' SHT logic by making use of a fuzzy extension of modus Tollens to
develop a model of truth valuation for its premises. Importantly, we show that
it is possible to preserve the soundness of Modus Tollens by exploring the
various conventions involved with constructing fuzzy negations and fuzzy
implications (namely, the S and R conventions). We find that under the S
convention, it is possible to conduct the Modus Tollens inference argument
using Zadeh's compositional extension and any possible t-norm. Under the R
convention we find that this is not necessarily the case, but that by mixing
R-implication with S-negation we can salvage the product t-norm, for example.
In conclusion, we have shown that fuzzy logic is a legitimate framework to
discuss and address the difficulties plaguing frequentist interpretations of
SHT.

obstacle to using SC for practical applications is the memory overhead of the
underlying cryptography. We develop MAGE, an execution engine for SC that
efficiently runs SC computations that do not fit in memory. We observe that,
due to their intended security guarantees, SC schemes are inherently oblivious
-- their memory access patterns are independent of the input data. Using this
property, MAGE calculates the memory access pattern ahead of time and uses it
to produce a memory management plan. This formulation of memory management,
which we call memory programming, is a generalization of paging that allows
MAGE to provide a highly efficient virtual memory abstraction for SC. MAGE
outperforms the OS virtual memory system by up to an order of magnitude, and in
many cases, runs SC computations that do not fit in memory at nearly the same
speed as if the underlying machines had unbounded physical memory to fit the
entire computation.

  Prediction in Local Consumer Service Platform",,,,,"cs.IR cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  As a new type of e-commerce platform developed in recent years, local
consumer service platform provides users with software to consume service to
the nearby store or to the home, such as Groupon and Koubei. Different from
other common e-commerce platforms, the behavior of users on the local consumer
service platform is closely related to their real-time local context
information. Therefore, building a context-aware user behavior prediction
system is able to provide both merchants and users better service in local
consumer service platforms. However, most of the previous work just treats the
contextual information as an ordinary feature into the prediction model to
obtain the prediction list under a specific context, which ignores the fact
that the interest of a user in different contexts is often significantly
different. Hence, in this paper, we propose a context-aware heterogeneous graph
attention network (CHGAT) to dynamically generate the representation of the
user and to estimate the probability for future behavior. Specifically, we
first construct the meta-path based heterogeneous graphs with the historical
behaviors from multiple sources and comprehend heterogeneous vertices in the
graph with a novel unified knowledge representing approach. Next, a multi-level
attention mechanism is introduced for context-aware aggregation with graph
vertices, which contains the vertex-level attention network and the path-level
attention network. Both of them aim to capture the semantic correlation between
information contained in the graph and the outside real-time contextual
information in the search system. Then the model proposed in this paper
aggregates specific graphs with their corresponding context features and
obtains the representation of user interest under a specific context and input
it into the prediction network to finally obtain the predicted probability of
user behavior.

ligands with halide ions (Br and Cl). Absorption, photoluminescence excitation
(PLE) and photoluminescence (PL) spectra in solution were unaffected by the
ligand-exchange procedure. The halide-capped NCs were stable in solution for
several weeks without modification of their PL spectra; once deposited as
unprotected thin films and exposed to air, however, they did show signs of
aging which we attribute to increasing heterogeneity of (effective) NC size.
Time-resolved PL measurements point to the existence of four distinct emissive
states, which we attribute to neutral, singlycharged and multi-excitonic
entities. We found that the relative contribution of these four components to
the overall PL decay is modified by the OA-to-halide ligand exchange, while the
excited-state lifetimes themselves, surprisingly, remain largley unaffected.
The high PL quantum yield of the halide-capped NCs allowed observation of
single particle blinking and photon-antibunching; one surprising result was
that aging processes that occurs during the first few days after deposition on
glass seemed to offer a certain increased protection against photobleaching.
These results suggest that halide-capped CdSe/CdZnS NCs are promising
candidates for incorporation into opto-electronic devices, based on, for
example, hybrid perovskite matrices, which require eliminating the steric
hindrance and electronic barrier of bulky organic ligands to ensure efficient
coupling.

High-fidelity (HF) responses describe the system of interest accurately but are
computed costly. In contrast, low-fidelity (LF) responses have a low
computational cost but could not meet the required accuracy. Multi-fidelity
data fusion (MDF) methods aims to use massive LF samples and small amounts of
HF samples to develop an accurate and efficient model for describing the system
with a reasonable computation burden. In this paper, we propose a novel
generative adversarial network for MDF in digital twins (GAN-MDF). The
generator of GAN-MDF is composed of two sub-networks: one extracts the LF
features from an input; and the other integrates the input and the extracted LF
features to form the input of the subsequent discriminator. The discriminator
of GAN-MDF identifies whether the generator output is a real sample generated
from HF model. To enhance the stability of GAN-MDF's training, we also
introduce the supervised-loss trick to refine the generator weights during each
iteration of the adversarial training. Compared with the state-of-the-art
methods, the proposed GAN-MDF has the following advantages: 1) it performs well
in the case of either nested or unnested sample structure; 2) there is no
specific assumption on the data distribution; and 3) it has high robustness
even when very few HF samples are provided. The experimental results also
support the validity of GAN-MDF.

challenges in the operation and control of the electricity grid. Demand
flexibility markets can help in dealing with these challenges by introducing
incentives for customers to modify their demand. Market-based demand-side
management (DSM) have garnered serious attention lately due to its promising
capability of maintaining the balance between supply and demand, while also
keeping customer satisfaction at its highest levels. Many researchers have
proposed using concepts from mechanism design theory in their approaches to
market-based DSM. In this work, we provide a review of the advances in
market-based DSM using mechanism design. We provide a categorisation of the
reviewed literature and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each design
criteria. We also study the utility function formulations used in the reviewed
literature and provide a critique of the proposed indirect mechanisms. We show
that despite the extensiveness of the literature on this subject, there remains
concerns and challenges that should be addressed for the realistic
implementation of such DSM approaches. We draw conclusions from our review and
discuss possible future research directions.

better understand human speech processing. We build a speech recognizer for
Italian based on the principles of Stevens' model of Lexical Access in which
words are stored as hierarchical arrangements of distinctive features (Stevens,
K. N. (2002). ""Toward a model for lexical access based on acoustic landmarks
and distinctive features,"" J. Acoust. Soc. Am., 111(4):1872-1891). Over the
past few decades, the Speech Communication Group at the Massachusetts Institute

this approach. Italian will be the first language beyond English to be
explored; the extension to another language provides the opportunity to test
the hypothesis that words are represented in memory as a set of
hierarchically-arranged distinctive features, and reveal which of the
underlying mechanisms may have a language-independent nature. This paper also
introduces a new Lexical Access corpus, the LaMIT database, created and labeled
specifically for this work, that will be provided freely to the speech research
community. Future developments will test the hypothesis that specific acoustic
discontinuities - called landmarks - that serve as cues to features, are
language independent, while other cues may be language-dependent, with powerful
implications for understanding how the human brain recognizes speech.

conformal mapping, the porous structures here can be generated by two
controlling field variables, the (logarithm of) the local scaling factor and
the rotational angle of the matrix cell, and they are interrelated through the
Cauchy-Riemann equations. Thus the design variables are simply reduced to the
logarithm values of the local scaling factor on selected boundary points. Other
attractive features shown by the present method are summarised as follows.
Firstly, with the condition of total differential automatically met by the two
controlling field variables, the integrability problem which necessitates
post-processing treatments in many other similar methods can be resolved
naturally. Secondly, according to the maximum principle for harmonic functions,
the minimum feature size can be explicitly monitored during optimisation.
Thirdly, the rotational symmetry possessed by the matrix cell can be fully
exploited in the context of conformal mapping, and the computational cost for
solving the cell problems for the homogenised elasticity tensor is maximally
abased. In particular, when the design domain takes a rectangle shape,
analytical expressions for the controlling fields are available. The
homogenised results are shown, both theoretically and numerically, to converge
to the corresponding fine-scale results, and the effectiveness of the proposed
work is further demonstrated with more numerical examples.

medium as a kind of dispersive media can be described by frequency-dependent
constitutive parameters. The most appropriate numerical techniques for analysis
of LH media are dispersive formulations of conventional numerical methods. In
comparison to the conventional grid-based numerical methods, it is proved that
meshless methods not only are strong tools for accurate approximation of
derivatives in Maxwell's equations but also can provide more flexibility in
modeling the spatial domain of problems. However, we have not seen any reports

us to take advantage of meshless methods in analysis of LH media. For modeling
the frequency behavior of the medium in the proposed dispersive formulation, we

evolution of the constant, field-independent term (which is constant with
respect to field variations but depends on the RG scale $k$) requires special
care within the Functional Renormalization Group (FRG) approach. In several
instances, the constant term of the potential has no physical meaning. However,
there are special cases where it receives important applications. In low
dimensions ($d=1$), in a quantum mechanical model, this term is associated with
the ground-state energy of the anharmonic oscillator. In higher dimensions
($d=4$), it is identical to the $\Lambda$ term of the Einstein equations and it
plays a role in cosmic inflation. Thus, in statistical field theory, in flat
space, the constant term could be associated with the free energy, while in
curved space, it could be naturally associated with the cosmological constant.
It is known that one has to use a subtraction method for the quantum anharmonic
oscillator in $d=1$ to remove the $k^2$ term that appears in the RG flow in its
high-energy (UV) limit in order to recover the correct results for the
ground-state energy. The subtraction is needed because the Gaussian fixed point
is missing in the RG flow once the constant term is included. However, if the
Gaussian fixed point is there, no further subtraction is required. Here, we
propose a subtraction method for $k^4$ and $k^2$ terms of the UV scaling of the
RG equations for $d=4$ dimensions if the Gaussian fixed point is missing in the
RG flow with the constant term. Finally, comments on the application of our
results to cosmological models are provided.

characterized computationally. The parametric conditions for local asymptotic
stability of equilibria are investigated with several illustrating examples. In
addition, several periodic solutions were achieved. Furthermore, high degree of
fractality of the prey-predator population trajectories is observed when the
system is sufficiently delayed. This system has turned out to be a cooperative
system, which is depicted using fractal dimension.
