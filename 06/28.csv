radio spurs and loops. Determining the physical size of these structures is
important for understanding the local interstellar structure and for modeling
the Galactic magnetic field. However, the distance to these structures is
either under debate or entirely unknown. We revisit a classical method of
finding the location of radio spurs by comparing optical polarization angles
with those of synchrotron emission as a function of distance. We consider three
tracers of the magnetic field: stellar polarization, polarized synchrotron
radio emission, and polarized thermal dust emission. We employ archival
measurements of optical starlight polarization and Gaia distances, and
construct a new map of polarized synchrotron emission from WMAP and Planck
data. We confirm that synchrotron, dust emission, and stellar polarization
angles all show a statistically significant alignment at high Galactic
latitude. We obtain distance limits to three regions towards Loop I of
112$\pm$17 pc, 135$\pm$20 pc, and $<105$ pc. Our results strongly suggest that
the polarized synchrotron emission towards the North Polar Spur at $b >
30^\circ$ is local. This is consistent with the conclusions of earlier work
based on stellar polarization and extinction, but in stark contrast with the
Galactic center origin recently revisited on the basis of X-ray data. We also
obtain a distance measurement towards part of Loop IV (180$\pm$15 pc) and find
evidence that its synchrotron emission arises from chance overlap of structures
located at different distances. Future optical polarization surveys will allow
the expansion of this analysis to other radio spurs.

orientational angle. Irrespective of $\alpha$ and $A^{}_r$, the functional form
of the magnetization-decay curve is perfectly exponentially decaying with
$h^{}_d\leq0.2$. There exists a transition in relaxation behaviour at
$h^{}_d\approx0.4$; magnetization relaxes slowly for $\alpha\leq45^\circ$; it
relaxes rapildy with $\alpha>45^\circ$. Interestingly, it decays rapidly for
$h^{}_d>0.6$, irrespective of $\alpha$. It is because the dipolar interaction
promotes antiferromagnetic coupling in such cases. There is a strong effect of
$\alpha$ on the magnetic relaxation in the highly anisotropic system
($A^{}_r\geq25$). Interesting physics unfolds in the case of a huge aspect
ratio $A^{}_r=400$. There is a rapid decay of magnetization with $\alpha$, even
for weakly interacting MNPs. Remarkably, magnetization does not relax even with
a moderate value of $h^{}_d=0.4$ and $\alpha=0^\circ$ because of ferromagnetic
coupling dominance. Surprisingly, there is a complete magnetization reversal
from saturation (+1) to $-1$ state with $\alpha>60^\circ$. The dipolar field
and anisotropy axis tend to get aligned antiparallel to each other in such a
case. The effective N\'eel relaxation time $\tau^{}_N$ depends weakly on
$\alpha$ for small $h^{}_d$ and $A^{}_r\leq25.0$. For large $A^{}_r$, there is
a rapid fall in $\tau^{}_N$ as $\alpha$ is incremented from 0 to $90^\circ$.
These results benefit applications in data and energy storages where such
controlled magnetization alignment and desired structural anisotropy are
desirable.

data structure from computer graphics, Binary Space Partitioning (BSP), to
facilitate 3D learning. The core operation of BSP involves recursive
subdivision of 3D space to obtain convex sets. By exploiting this property, we
devise BSP-Net, a network that learns to represent a 3D shape via convex
decomposition without supervision. The network is trained to reconstruct a
shape using a set of convexes obtained from a BSP-tree built over a set of
planes, where the planes and convexes are both defined by learned network
weights. BSP-Net directly outputs polygonal meshes from the inferred convexes.
The generated meshes are watertight, compact (i.e., low-poly), and well suited
to represent sharp geometry. We show that the reconstruction quality by BSP-Net
is competitive with those from state-of-the-art methods while using much fewer

  The symbol $p({\mathbf x}, {\mathbf y})$ encapsulates a lot of useful
information about the structure of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy distance
defined by the kernel $K$. We approximate $p({\mathbf x}, {\mathbf y})$ with
the sum of the first $r$ terms of the Singular Value Decomposition of $p$,
denoted by $p_r({\mathbf x}, {\mathbf y})$. If ordered singular values of the
integral operator associated with $p({\mathbf x}, {\mathbf y})$ die down
rapidly, the MMD distance defined by the new symbol $p_r$ differs from the
initial one only slightly. Moreover, the new MMD distance can be interpreted as
an aggregated result of comparing $r$ local moments of two probability
distributions.
  The latter results holds under the condition that right singular vectors of
the integral operator associated with $p$ are uniformly bounded. But even if
this is not satisfied we can still hold that the Hilbert-Schmidt distance

the inertial range, these poorly represented scales are dynamically significant
and errors in their dynamics can affect all resolved scales. This Letter is
focused on characterizing the effects of numerical dispersion error by studying
the energy cascade in LES of convecting homogeneous isotropic turbulence.
Numerical energy and transfer spectra reveal that energy is not transferred at
the appropriate rate to wavemodes where significant dispersion error is
present. This leads to a deficiency of energy in highly dispersive modes and an
accompanying pile up of energy in the well resolved modes, since dissipation by
the subgrid model is diminished. An asymptotic analysis indicates that
dispersion error causes a phase decoherence between triad interacting
wavemodes, leading to a reduction in the mean energy transfer rate for these
scales. These findings are relevant to a wide range of LES, since turbulence
commonly convects through the grid in practical simulations. Further, these
results indicate that the resolved scales should be defined to not include the
dispersive modes.

Quantum Schnorr randomness is then introduced. A quantum analogue of the law of
large numbers is shown to hold for quantum Schnorr random states. We introduce
quantum-K, ($QK$) a measure of the descriptive complexity of density matrices
using classical prefix-free Turing machines and show that the initial segments
of weak Solovay random and quantum Schnorr random states are incompressible in
the sense of $QK$. Several connections between Solovay randomness and $K$ carry
over to those between weak Solovay randomness and $QK$. We then define $QK_C$,
using computable measure machines and connect it to quantum Schnorr randomness.
We then explore a notion of `measuring' a state. We formalize how `measurement'
of a state induces a probability measure on the space of infinite bitstrings. A
state is `measurement random' ($mR$) if the measure induced by it, under any
computable basis, assigns probability one to the set of Martin-L\""of randoms.
I.e., measuring a $mR$ state produces a Martin-L\""of random bitstring almost
surely. While quantum-Martin-L\""of random states are $mR$, the converse fails:
there is a $mR$ state, $\rho$ which is not quantum-Martin-L\""of random. In
fact, something stronger is true. While $\rho$ is computable and can be easily
constructed, measuring it in any computable basis yields an arithmetically

analyze how fine-tuning changes the space. We hypothesize that fine-tuning
affects classification performance by increasing the distances between examples

designed experiments on five different NLP tasks. Via these experiments, we
also discover an exception to the prevailing wisdom that ""fine-tuning always
improves performance"". Finally, by comparing the representations before and

changes to representations; instead, it adjusts the representations to

relation called strong reduction is presented. It complements other existing
conformance relations in the sense that the new relation is well-suited for
model-based testing of systems whose inputs are enabled or disabled, depending
on the actual system state. Examples of such systems are graphical user
interfaces and systems with interfaces that can be enabled or disabled in a
mechanical way. We present a new test generation algorithm producing complete
test suites for strong reduction. The suites are executed according to the
grey-box testing paradigm: it is assumed that the state-dependent sets of
enabled inputs can be identified during test execution, while the
implementation states remain hidden, as in black-box testing. It is shown that
this grey-box information is exploited by the generation algorithm in such a
way that the resulting best-case test suite size is only linear in the state
space size of the reference model. Moreover, examples show that this may lead
to significant reductions of test suite size in comparison to true black-box
testing for strong reduction.

uplink multi-user system using real-valued modulation schemes, where the
cellular base station (BS) with multiple antennas provides connectivity for
randomly deployed single-antenna users. The targeted use case is massive
machine type communication (mMTC) with grant-free access in the uplink, where
the network is required to host a large number of low data rate devices
transmitting in an uncoordinated fashion. Four types of WL receivers are
investigated, namely the WL zero-forcing (ZF) and the WL minimum meansquared
error (MMSE) receivers, along with their enhanced versions employing successive
interference cancellation (SIC) with channel-dependent ordering, i.e., the
WL-ZF-SIC and WL-MMSE-SIC receivers. The outage performances of these receivers
are analytically characterized in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime
and compared to those of conventional linear (CL) receivers using
complex-valued modulation schemes. For the non-SIC receivers, we show that,
when compared to the CL counterparts, the WL receivers yield a higher diversity
gain when decoding the same number of users and have the same diversity gain
but a decreased coding gain when the number of users is nearly doubled. The
outage performance analysis of WL-SIC receivers is facilitated by the marginal
distribution of ordered eigenvalues of a real-valued Wishart matrix. It is
shown that the SIC operation with channel-dependent ordering brings no
additional diversity gain to the WL receivers but instead increases the coding
gain. Moreover, the coding gain of WL-SIC receivers grows as the number of
users increases and even exceeds that of CL-SIC receivers under suitable
conditions.

a canonical problem that admits two difficulties in optimization: 1)
non-convexity and 2) non-smoothness (due to unbalancedness of $\mathbf{U}$ and
$\mathbf{V}$). This is also a prototype for more complex problems such as
asymmetric matrix sensing and matrix completion. Despite being non-convex and
non-smooth, it has been observed empirically that the randomly initialized

Moreover, such kinetic instabilities are expected to be even more effective in
the presence of suprathermal Kappa-distributed populations, which are
ubiquitous in the solar wind, are less affected by collisions than the core
population, but contribute with an additional free energy. In this work we use
both linear and extended quasi-linear (QL) frameworks to characterize the
unstable periodic proton firehose modes (propagating parallel to the magnetic
field) under the influence of suprathermal protons. Linear theory predicts a
systematic stimulation of the instability, suprathermals amplifying the growth
rates and decreasing the instability thresholds to lower anisotropies and lower
plasma betas ($\beta_{p \parallel}<1$). In perfect agreement with these
results, the QL approach reveals a significant enhancement of the resulting
electromagnetic fluctuations up to the saturation with a stronger back reaction
on protons, leading also to a faster and more efficient relaxation of the

the OAI dataset, which is a remarkable gain over the existing best-published

structure of the Galactic bulge. We find X-shaped [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe]
distributions in the bulge that are more pinched than the bulge density, a
signature of its disk origin. The mean abundance along the major axis of the
bar varies such that the stars are more [Fe/H]-poor and [Mg/Fe]-rich near the
Galactic center than in the long bar/outer bulge region. The vertical [Fe/H]
and [Mg/Fe] gradients vary between the inner bulge and long bar with the inner
bulge showing a flattening near the plane that is absent in the long bar. The
[Fe/H]-[Mg/Fe] distribution shows two main maxima, an ``[Fe/H]-poor [Mg/Fe]-
rich'' maximum and an ``[Fe/H]-rich [Mg/Fe]-poor'' maximum, that vary in
strength with position in the bulge. In particular, the outer long bar close to
the Galactic plane is dominated by super-solar [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe]-normal stars.
Stars composing the [Fe/H]-rich maximum show little kinematic dependence on
[Fe/H], but for lower [Fe/H] the rotation and dispersion of the bulge increase
slowly. Stars with [Fe/H]<-1 dex have a very different kinematic structure than
stars with higher [Fe/H]. Comparing with recent models for the Galactic
boxy-peanut bulge, the abundance gradients and distribution, and the relation
between [Fe/H] and kinematics suggest that the stars comprising each maximum
have separate disk origins with the ``[Fe/H]-poor [Mg/Fe]-rich'' stars

canonical way, establishing the corresponding Wheeler-DeWitt equation in the
minisuperspace, and analyze the quantum solutions. When the energy conditions
are violated, corresponding to the case $\omega<-3/2$, the energy is bounded
from below and singularity-free solutions are found. However, in the case
$\omega> -3/2$ we cannot compute the evolution of the scale factor by
evaluating the expectation values because the wave function is not finite
(energy spectrum is not bounded from below). But we can analyze this case using
Bohmian mechanics and the de Broglie-Bohm interpretation of quantum mechanics.
Using this approach, the classical and quantum results can be compared for any
value of $\omega$.

many applications due to their simplicity and geometric interpretability.
However, the robustness of kNN-based classification models has not been
thoroughly explored and kNN attack strategies are underdeveloped. In this
paper, we propose an Adversarial Soft kNN (ASK) loss to both design more
effective kNN attack strategies and to develop better defenses against them.
Our ASK loss approach has two advantages. First, ASK loss can better
approximate the kNN's probability of classification error than objectives
proposed in previous works. Second, the ASK loss is interpretable: it preserves
the mutual information between the perturbed input and the in-class-reference
data. We use the ASK loss to generate a novel attack method called the
ASK-Attack (ASK-Atk), which shows superior attack efficiency and accuracy
degradation relative to previous kNN attacks. Based on the ASK-Atk, we then
derive an ASK-\underline{Def}ense (ASK-Def) method that optimizes the
worst-case training loss induced by ASK-Atk. Experiments on CIFAR-10 (ImageNet)
show that (i) ASK-Atk achieves $\geq 13\%$ ($\geq 13\%$) improvement in attack
success rate over previous kNN attacks, and (ii) ASK-Def outperforms the
conventional adversarial training method by $\geq 6.9\%$ ($\geq 3.5\%$) in
terms of robustness improvement.

This finding is at odds with the $\Lambda$CDM prediction, which assumes a scale
invariant infinite universe. Such anomaly is consistent with the well known low
quadrupule amplitude in the angular $\delta T$ spectrum, but quantified in a
direct and model independent way. We estimate the significance of our finding

properties and extensive dependencies on third-party libraries without type
annotations, the performance of traditional static analysis techniques is
limited. Although semantics in source code can help manifest intended usage for
variables (thus help infer types), they are usually ignored by existing tools.
In this paper, we propose PYInfer, an end-to-end learning-based type inference
tool that automatically generates type annotations for Python variables. The
key insight is that contextual code semantics is critical in inferring the type
for a variable. For each use of a variable, we collect a few tokens within its
contextual scope, and design a neural network to predict its type. One
challenge is that it is difficult to collect a high-quality human-labeled
training dataset for this purpose. To address this issue, we apply an existing
static analyzer to generate the ground truth for variables in source code.
  Our main contribution is a novel approach to statically infer variable types
effectively and efficiently. Formulating the type inference as a classification
problem, we can handle user-defined types and predict type probabilities for
each variable. Our model achieves 91.2% accuracy on classifying 11 basic types
in Python and 81.2% accuracy on classifying 500 most common types. Our results
substantially outperform the state-of-the-art type annotators. Moreover,
PYInfer achieves 5.2X more code coverage and is 187X faster than a
state-of-the-art learning-based tool. With similar time consumption, our model
annotates 5X more variables than a state-of-the-art static analysis tool. Our
model also outperforms a learning-based function-level annotator on annotating
types for variables and function arguments. All our tools and datasets are

potentially rendezvous with newly discovered transient interstellar objects
(ISOs) is described. The mission concept derives from the proposal for a
technology demonstration mission for exiting the solar system at high velocity,
eventually to reach the focal region of the solar gravitational lens. The ISO
mission concept is to fly a solar sail toward a holding orbit around the Sun
and when the ISO orbit is confirmed, target the sailcraft to reach an escape
velocity of over 6 AU/year. This would permit rapid response to a new ISO
discovery and an intercept within 10 AU from the Sun. Two new proven
interplanetary technologies are utilized to enable such a mission: i)
interplanetary smallsats, such as those demonstrated by the MarCO mission, and
ii) solar sails, such as demonstrated by LightSail and IKAROS missions and
developed for NEA Scout and Solar Cruiser missions. Current technology work
suggests that already within this decade such a mission could fly and reach an
ISO moving through the solar system. It might enable the first encounter with
an ISO to allow for imaging and spectroscopy, measurements of size and mass,
potentially giving a unique information about the object's origin and
composition. A similar approach may be used to allow for a sample return.

of the source is seen to vary by two orders of magnitudes within a month but a
short-term variability was not observed over the time intervals of 100-2000
second in the 0.3-10 keV energy band. We find some evidence for the existence
of bi-modality feature in the flux distribution of ULX-4. We identified two
optical sources as possible counterparts within an error radius of 0.""18 at 95%
confidence level for ULX-4 based on the archival HST/ACS and HST/WFC3 data.
Blackbody fits of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) indicate the
spectral type to be B-type stars. One of these counterparts exhibits a
low-amplitude optical periodicity of 264 days in the F606W filter; if we assume
this apparent periodicity is associated with the orbital motion of the donor,
then it is more likely that the donor is a red supergiant satisfying the long
periodicity and accretion via Roche-lobe overflow. Consequently, the SED would
then have to be interpreted as a superposition of emissions from a cold donor
and a hot flow component, most likely from an accretion disk. If, on the other
hand, the periodicity is super orbital in nature i.e., due to possible
interactions of the compact object with a circumstellar disk, the donor could
then be a Be/X star hosting a neutron star.

computer-simulations, it is important to account for the variability in the
ensemble of objects to be imaged. This source of variability can be described
by stochastic object models (SOMs). It is generally desirable to establish SOMs
from experimental imaging measurements acquired by use of a well-characterized
imaging system, but this task has remained challenging. Approach: A generative
adversarial network (GAN)-based method that employs AmbientGANs with modern
progressive or multiresolution training approaches is proposed. AmbientGANs
established using the proposed training procedure are systematically validated
in a controlled way using computer-simulated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
data corresponding to a stylized imaging system. Emulated single-coil
experimental MRI data are also employed to demonstrate the methods under less
stylized conditions. Results: The proposed AmbientGAN method can generate clean
images when the imaging measurements are contaminated by measurement noise.
When the imaging measurement data are incomplete, the proposed AmbientGAN can
reliably learn the distribution of the measurement components of the objects.
Conclusions: Both visual examinations and quantitative analyses, including
task-specific validations using the Hotelling observer, demonstrated that the
proposed AmbientGAN method holds promise to establish realistic SOMs from
imaging measurements.

as well as its integration into infrared imaging and sensing systems without
compromising their thermographic or radiometric capabilities. From a practical

  Shedding Control",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper proposes a cooperative game theory-based under-frequency load
shedding (UFLS) approach for frequency stability and control in power systems.
UFLS is a crucial factor for frequency stability and control especially in
power grids with high penetration of renewable energy sources and restructured
power systems. Conventional UFLS methods, most of which are off-line, usually
shed fixed amounts of predetermined loads based on a predetermined schedule
which can lead to over or under curtailment of load. This paper presents a
co-operative game theory-based two-stage strategy to effectively and precisely
determine locations and amounts of loads to be shed for UFLS control. In the
first stage, the total amount of loads to be shed, also referred to as deficit
in generation or the disturbance power, is computed using the initial rate of
change of frequency (ROCOF) referred to the equivalent inertial center. In the
second stage, the Shapley value, one of the solution concepts of cooperative
game theory, is used to determine load shedding amounts and locations. The
proposed method is implemented on the reduced 9-bus 3-machine Western
Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system and simulated on Real-time
Digital Simulators (RTDS). The results show that the proposed UFLS approach can
effectively return the system to normal state after disturbances.

(spatially variant) motion blur caused by object motion and camera shake
without knowing the blur kernel. Some methods directly output the latent sharp
image in one stage, while others utilize a multi-stage strategy (\eg
multi-scale, multi-patch, or multi-temporal) to gradually restore the sharp
image. However, these methods have the following two main issues: 1) The
computational cost of multi-stage is high; 2) The same convolution kernel is
applied in different regions, which is not an ideal choice for non-uniform
blur. Hence, non-uniform motion deblurring is still a challenging and open
problem. In this paper, we propose a new architecture which consists of
multiple Atrous Spatial Pyramid Deformable Convolution (ASPDC) modules to
deblur an image end-to-end with more flexibility. Multiple ASPDC modules
implicitly learn the pixel-specific motion with different dilation rates in the
same layer to handle movements of different magnitude. To improve the training,
we also propose a reblurring network to map the deblurred output back to the
blurred input, which constrains the solution space. Our experimental results
show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the

We calculate
axially symmetric models in which an elastic force balances solenoidal motion
driven by a Lorentz force. A large variety of equilibrium models are allowed by
incorporating the elastic shear deformation; in addition,
toroidal-magnetic-field dominated models are available. These results
remarkably differ from those in barotropic fluid stars. We demonstrate some
models wherein the magnetic energy exceeds the elastic energy. The excess comes
from the fact that a large amount of magnetic energy is associated with the
irrotational part of the magnetic force, which is balanced with gravity and
pressure. It is sufficient for equilibrium models that the minor solenoidal
part is balanced by a weak elastic force. We find that the elasticity in the
crust plays an important role on the magnetic-field confinement. Further, we
present the spatial distribution of the shear-stress at the elastic limit, by

classes and then identify instances of new classes. However, many of the
existing methods of OSR only makes a binary decision, i.e., they only identify
the existence of the unknown class. Hence, such methods cannot distinguish test
instances belonging to incremental unseen classes. On the other hand, the
majority of NEL methods often make a parametric assumption over the data

Non-Exhaustive Gaussian Mixture Generative Adversarial Networks (NE-GM-GAN) to

incremental detection of instances of emerging classes in the test data.
Extensive experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that
NE-GM-GAN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in detecting

materials. Physically based constitutive equations of crystal plasticity
typically incorporate dislocation mechanisms, using a dislocation density based
description of dislocation microstructure evolution and plastic flow.
Typically, such constitutive models are not formulated in a thermodynamic
framework. Nevertheless, fundamental considerations of thermodynamic
consistency impose constraints on the admissible range of model parameters
and/or on the range of application of such models. In particular, it is
mandatory to ensure that the internal energy increase associated with
dislocation accumulation is properly accounted for in the local energy balance.
We demonstrate on some examples taken from the literature how failure to do so
can lead to constitutive equations that violate the first and second laws of
thermodynamics either generally or in some particular limit cases, and we
discuss how to formulate constraints that recover thermodynamic consistency.

gain matrices in model predictive controllers, as this is a challenge known to
be inhibiting industrial implementation of these architectures. To demonstrate
the framework we consider the problem of MIMO diesel air-path control, and

than those inferred from far-ultraviolet (FUV) fluxes, we attempt to determine
whether the same trend exists in the extended disks of two star-forming

to measure the FUV and H$\alpha$ fluxes of star-forming regions. We also
perform spectral energy distribution (SED) fittings using 11 photometric data

Comparing SFR$_\mathrm{FUV}$ and SFR$_\mathrm{H\alpha}$, which are converted
from the H$\alpha$ and FUV fluxes corrected for the local properties, we find
that SFR$_\mathrm{H\alpha}$/SFR$_\mathrm{FUV}$ tends to decrease as the SFR
decreases. We evaluate possible causes of this discrepancy between the two SFRs
by restricting parameters in the SED fitting and conclude that deficient
H$\alpha$ fluxes in the extended disks of galaxies are tightly correlated with
recent starbursts. The strong and short starburst which is being rapidly
suppressed over the last 10 Myr seems to induce a significant discrepancy
between the SFR$_\mathrm{H\alpha}$ and SFR$_\mathrm{FUV}$. In addition, the

We first identify a set of vectors (""discourse atoms"") that provide a sparse

topics: Through a generative model, atoms map onto distributions over words;
one can also infer the topic that generated a sequence of words. We illustrate

incidents with structured variables and unstructured narratives. We identify
225 latent topics in the narratives (e.g., preparation for death and physical
aggression); many of these topics are not captured by existing structured
variables. Motivated by known patterns in suicide and homicide by gender, and
recent research on gender biases in semantic space, we identify the gender bias
of our topics (e.g., a topic about pain medication is feminine). We then
compare the gender bias of topics to their prevalence in narratives of female
versus male victims. Results provide a detailed quantitative picture of
reporting about lethal violence and its gendered nature. Our method offers a

in the luminosity was $\sim$ $10^{46}\text{erg}~\text{s}^{-1}$ -- more than 10
times higher than the mean level before the outburst -- and a

evolution with flare time and soft X-ray luminosity. Critically, the luminosity
of the soft X-rays decayed following a power law of $t^{-5/3}$ which occurs in
most tidal disruption events (TDEs), and similar trend can be seen in UV and
optical bands during the soft X-ray declining period. Helium and oxygen narrow

overlapped speech mixtures for training. However, since most real-life

learning of target speech separation and personal VAD. The weighted SI-SNR loss
imposes a weight factor that is proportional to the target speaker's duration
and returns zero when the target speaker is absent. Meanwhile, the personal VAD
generates masks and sets non-target speech to silence. Experiments show that
our proposed method outperforms the baseline by 1.73 dB in terms of SDR on

is an important phenomenon to be considered for the thermal stability of the
van der Waals heterstructure as temperature commonly rises during the operation
of nano devices. In the present work, the thermal expansion coefficient for the
graphene/MoS$_2$ heterostructure is investigated by molecular dynamics
simulations, and the effect from the unavoidable misfit strain on the thermal
expansion coefficient is revealed. The misfit strain can tune the thermal
expansion coefficient by a factor of six, and this effect is quite robust in
sense that it is not sensitive to the size or direction of the heterostructure.
An analytic formula is derived to directly relate the thermal expansion
coefficient to the misfit strain of the heterostructure, which qualitatively
agrees with the numerical results although the analytic formula underestimates
the misfit strain effect. Further analysis discloses that the misfit strain can
efficiently engineer the thermal induced ripples, which serves as the key
mechanism for the misfit strain effect on the thermal expansion coefficient.
These findings provide valuable information for the thermal stability of van

of the polarization excitation functions can be linked to the relative
abundance of $\Lambda$s coming from the core versus those coming from the
corona. For low collision energies, the former are more abundant whereas for
higher energies the latter become more abundant. The main consequence of this
reversing of the relative abundance is that both polarizations peak at
collision energies $\sqrt{s_{NN}}\lesssim 10$ GeV. The exact positions and
heights of these peaks depend not only on this reversal of relative abundances,
but also on the centrality class, which is directly related to the QGP volume

the current paper is to demonstrate how this analysis can be extended to
account for more than one missile threat. This is achieved by introducing a
jump stochastic process whose states represent the number of missiles defeated
at a given time instant. Analysis proceeds through consideration of the sojourn
times of this stochastic process, and it is shown how consideration of these
jump times can be related to transition probabilities of the auxiliary
stochastic process. The latter probabilities are then related to the
probabilities of detection and disruption of missile threats. The sum of these
sojourn times can then be used to quantify the survivability of the team at any
given time instant. Due to the fact that there is much interest in the
application of high energy lasers in the context of this paper, the numerical
examples will thus focus on such directed energy weapons for armoured fighting

team of robots equipped with visual-inertial sensors. Each robot builds a local
trajectory estimate and a local mesh using Kimera. When communication is
available, robots initiate a distributed place recognition and robust pose
graph optimization protocol based on a novel distributed graduated
non-convexity algorithm. The proposed protocol allows the robots to improve
their local trajectory estimates by leveraging inter-robot loop closures while
being robust to outliers. Finally, each robot uses its improved trajectory
estimate to correct the local mesh using mesh deformation techniques.

tail items without differentiating the degree of users' intent on popularity
and often incur a sharp decline of accuracy. Moreover, none of existing methods
has ever taken the extreme case of tail items, i.e., cold-start items without

  In this work, we first disclose the mechanism that drives a user's
interaction towards popular or niche items by disentangling her intent into
conformity influence (popularity) and personal interests (preference). We then
present a unified end-to-end framework to simultaneously optimize accuracy and
novelty targets based on the disentangled intent of popularity and that of

networked version of AD, we argue that the KKO model is too local, in the sense
that goods cannot travel more than one hop through the network. We introduce an
alternative model in which agents may purchase goods on credit in order to
resell them. In contrast to KKO, our model allows for long-range trade, and
yields equilibria in more settings than KKO, including sparse endowments. Our
model smoothly interpolates between the KKO and AD equilibrium concepts: we
recover KKO when the resale capacity is zero, and recover AD when it is
sufficiently large. We give general equilibrium existence results, and an
auction-based algorithm to compute approximate equilibria when agent utilities
satisfy the weak gross-substitutes property.

and has connections with other areas of mathematics such as hyperplane
arrangements. For arbitrary functions $f$ and $g$, $f\sqcup g$ is the function
with domain $dom(f)\cup dom(g)$ that agrees with $f$ on $dom(f)$ and with $g$
on $dom(g) \backslash dom(f)$. Jackson and the author have shown that there is
no finite axiomatisation of algebras of functions of signature $(\sqcup)$. But
adding operations (such as {\em update}) to this minimal signature can lead to
finite axiomatisations. For the functional signature $(\sqcup,\backslash)$
where $\backslash$ is set-theoretic difference, Cirulis has given a finite
equational axiomatisation as subtraction o-semilattices. Define $f\curlyvee
g=(f\sqcup g)\cap (g\sqcup f)$ for all functions $f$ and $g$; this is the
largest domain restriction of the binary relation $f\cup g$ that gives a
partial function. Now $f\cap g=f\backslash(f\backslash g)$ and $f\sqcup
g=f\curlyvee(f\curlyvee g)$ for all functions $f,g$, so the signatures
$(\curlyvee)$ and $(\sqcup,\cap)$ are both intermediate between $(\sqcup)$ and
$(\sqcup,\backslash)$ in expressive power. We show that each is finitely
axiomatised, with the former giving a proper quasivariety and the latter the
variety of associative distributive o-semilattices in the sense of Cirulis.

problem. Recently, such controllers were introduced for the 1D heat equation,
under the assumption that one of the observation or control operators is
bounded. This paper suggests a constructive method for such controllers for 1D
parabolic PDEs with both (observation and control) operators being unbounded.
We consider the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation (KSE) under either boundary or
in-domain point measurement and boundary actuation. We employ a modal
decomposition approach via dynamic extension, using eigenfunctions of a
Sturm-Liouville operator. The controller dimension is defined by the number of
unstable modes, whereas the observer dimension $N$ may be larger than this
number. We suggest a direct Lyapunov approach to the full-order closed-loop
system, which results in an LMI whose elements and dimension depend on $N$. The
value of $N$ and the decay rate are obtained from the LMI. We extend our
approach to internal stabilization with guaranteed $L^2$-gain and
input-to-state stabilization. We prove two crucial properties of the derived
LMIs. First, We prove that the LMIs are always feasible provided $N$ and the
$L^2$ or ISS gains are large enough, thereby obtaining guarantees for our
approach. Moreover, for the case of stabilization, we show that feasibility of
the LMI for some $N$ implies its feasibility for $N+1$ (i.e., enlarging $N$ in
the LMI cannot deteriorate the resulting decay rate of the closed-loop system).
Numerical examples demonstrate the efficiency of the method.

the accretion bursts and whether the disks of FUors are in any way different
from disks of non-bursting young stellar objects. Motivated by this, we
conducted a 1.3 mm continuum survey of ten FUors and FUor-like objects with

disk masses that are significantly larger than what is obtained from the

the FUor disks are optically thick at this wavelength. In comparison with

through gradual rules such as: ""the more X, the more Y"". Such correlations are
useful in identifying and isolating relationships among the attributes that may
not be obvious through quick scans on a data set. For instance, a researcher
may apply gradual pattern mining to determine which attributes of a data set
exhibit unfamiliar correlations in order to isolate them for deeper exploration
or analysis. In this work, we propose an ant colony optimization technique
which uses a popular probabilistic approach that mimics the behavior biological
ants as they search for the shortest path to find food in order to solve
combinatorial problems. In our second contribution, we extend an existing
gradual pattern mining technique to allow for extraction of gradual patterns
together with an approximated temporal lag between the affected gradual item
sets. Such a pattern is referred to as a fuzzy-temporal gradual pattern and it
may take the form: ""the more X, the more Y, almost 3 months later"". In our
third contribution, we propose a data crossing model that allows for
integration of mostly gradual pattern mining algorithm implementations into a
Cloud platform. This contribution is motivated by the proliferation of IoT
applications in almost every area of our society and this comes with provision
of large-scale time-series data from different sources.

Zhao et al. (2011) has highlighted the difficulty in differentiating between
compressed and encrypted files using Shannon entropy as both file types exhibit
similar values. One of the experiments described in this paper shows a unique
characteristic for the Shannon entropy of encrypted file header fragments. This
characteristic was used to differentiate between encrypted files and other high
entropy files such as archives. This discovery was leveraged in the development
of a file classification model that used the differential area between the
entropy curve of a file under analysis and one generated from random data. When
comparing the entropy plot values of a file under analysis against one
generated by a file containing purely random numbers, the greater the

  Data",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Learning efficiently a causal model of the environment is a key challenge of
model-based RL agents operating in POMDPs. We consider here a scenario where
the learning agent has the ability to collect online experiences through direct
interactions with the environment (interventional data), but has also access to
a large collection of offline experiences, obtained by observing another agent
interacting with the environment (observational data). A key ingredient, that
makes this situation non-trivial, is that we allow the observed agent to
interact with the environment based on hidden information, which is not
observed by the learning agent. We then ask the following questions: can the
online and offline experiences be safely combined for learning a causal model ?
And can we expect the offline experiences to improve the agent's performances ?
To answer these questions, we import ideas from the well-established causal
framework of do-calculus, and we express model-based reinforcement learning as
a causal inference problem. Then, we propose a general yet simple methodology
for leveraging offline data during learning. In a nutshell, the method relies
on learning a latent-based causal transition model that explains both the
interventional and observational regimes, and then using the recovered latent
variable to infer the standard POMDP transition model via deconfounding. We
prove our method is correct and efficient in the sense that it attains better
generalization guarantees due to the offline data (in the asymptotic case), and
we illustrate its effectiveness empirically on synthetic toy problems. Our
contribution aims at bridging the gap between the fields of reinforcement
learning and causality.

Muckenhoupt weight with respect to the underlying natural weighted space

electrons that can move through the lattice without resistance below the

superconductors form anti-parallel spin singlets with total spin $S=0$,
although they can also form parallel spin-triplet Cooper pairs with $S=1$ and
an odd parity wavefunction. Spin-triplet pairing is important because it can
host topological states and Majorana fermions relevant for quantum computation.
Because spin-triplet pairing is usually mediated by ferromagnetic (FM) spin
fluctuations, uranium based materials near an FM instability are considered to
be ideal candidates for realizing spin-triplet superconductivity. Indeed,
UTe$_2$, which has a $T_c\approx 1.6$ K, has been identified as a candidate for
a chiral spin-triplet topological superconductor near an FM instability,
although it also has antiferromagnetic (AF) spin fluctuations. Here we use
inelastic neutron scattering (INS) to show that superconductivity in UTe$_2$ is
coupled to a sharp magnetic excitation, termed resonance, at the Brillouin zone
boundary near AF order. Because the resonance has only been found in
spin-singlet unconventional superconductors near an AF instability, its
observation in UTe$_2$ suggests that AF spin fluctuations may also induce
spin-triplet pairing or that electron pairing in UTe$_2$ has a spin-singlet
component.

we rigorously prove that the extrema of the total entropy of perfect fluid

soliton ejection stimulated through the scattering of bright solitons by
modulated reflectionless potential wells. Such potential wells allow for the
possibility of controlled ejection of solitons with significantly high speeds.
At the outset, we describe the scattering setup and characterise the soliton
ejection in terms of the different parameters of the system. Then, we formulate
a theoretical model revealing the underlying physics of soliton ejection. The
model is based on energy and norm exchange between the incident soliton and a
stable trapped mode corresponding to an exact solution of the governing
nonlinear Schrodinger equation. Remarkably, stationary solitons can lead to
high-speed soliton ejection where part of the nonlinear interaction energy
transforms to translational kinetic energy of the ejected soliton. Our
investigation shows that soliton ejection always occurs whenever the incident
soliton norm is greater than that of the trapped mode while their energy is
almost the same. Once the incident soliton is trapped, the excess in norm turns
to an ejected soliton in addition to a small amount of radiation that share
translational kinetic energy. We found that higher ejection speeds are obtained
with multi-node trapped modes that have larger binding energy. Simultaneous
two-soliton ejection has been also induced by two solitons scattering with the
potential from both of its sides. An ejection speed almost twice as that of
single soliton ejection was obtained. Ejection outcome and ejection speed turn
out to be sensitive to the relative phase between the two incoming solitons,
which suggests a tool for soliton phase interferometry.

using attribute embeddings is that (some of the) semantic dependencies between

to shed light on this question, focusing on settings where the embedding of an

particular focus is on studying the theoretical limitations of different

  Zambia",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Improvements to Zambia's malaria surveillance system allow better monitoring
of incidence and targetting of responses at refined spatial scales. As
transmission decreases, understanding heterogeneity in risk at fine spatial
scales becomes increasingly important. However, there are challenges in using
health system data for high-resolution risk mapping: health facilities have
undefined and overlapping catchment areas, and report on an inconsistent basis.
We propose a novel inferential framework for risk mapping of malaria incidence
data based on formal down-scaling of confirmed case data reported through the
health system in Zambia. We combine data from large community intervention
trials in 2011-2016 and model health facility catchments based upon
treatment-seeking behaviours; our model for monthly incidence is an aggregated
log-Gaussian Cox process, which allows us to predict incidence at fine scale.
We predicted monthly malaria incidence at 5km$^2$ resolution nationally:
whereas 4.8 million malaria cases were reported through the health system in
2016, we estimated that the number of cases occurring at the community level
was closer to 10 million. As Zambia continues to scale up community-based
reporting of malaria incidence, these outputs provide realistic estimates of
community-level malaria burden as well as high resolution risk maps for
targeting interventions at the sub-catchment level.

foreground pixels in an image. However, most existing deep learning-based
methods still suffer from the coarse-grained details. In general, these
algorithms are incapable of felicitously distinguishing the degree of
exploration between deterministic domains (certain FG and BG pixels) and
undetermined domains (uncertain in-between pixels), or inevitably lose
information in the continuous sampling process, leading to a sub-optimal
result. In this paper, we propose a novel network named Prior-Induced
Information Alignment Matting Network (PIIAMatting), which can efficiently
model the distinction of pixel-wise response maps and the correlation of
layer-wise feature maps. It mainly consists of a Dynamic Gaussian Modulation
mechanism (DGM) and an Information Alignment strategy (IA). Specifically, the
DGM can dynamically acquire a pixel-wise domain response map learned from the
prior distribution. The response map can present the relationship between the
opacity variation and the convergence process during training. On the other
hand, the IA comprises an Information Match Module (IMM) and an Information
Aggregation Module (IAM), jointly scheduled to match and aggregate the adjacent
layer-wise features adaptively. Besides, we also develop a Multi-Scale
Refinement (MSR) module to integrate multi-scale receptive field information at
the refinement stage to recover the fluctuating appearance details. Extensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed

outbursts of this source show variations in duration, peak numbers, highest

showed outbursts of two types, such as normal and super. The normal outbursts

feasible allocation that is envy-free (EF), in which the agents do not envy
each other for the items they receive, nor do they envy a charity, who is
endowed with all the unallocated items. Since EF allocations barely exist even
without budget constraints, we are interested in the relaxed notion of
envy-freeness up to one item (EF1). The computation of both exact and
approximate EF1 allocations remains largely open, despite a recent effort by Wu
et al. (IJCAI 2021) in showing that any budget-feasible allocation that

we move one step forward by showing that for agents with identical additive

that extracts and encodes linguistic features from the input image by embedded

  fluid mixtures",,,,,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In solution-processing of thin films, the material layer is deposited from a
solution composed of several solutes and solvents. The final morphology and
hence the properties of the film often depend on the time needed for the
evaporation of the solvents. This is typically the case for organic photoactive
or electronic layers. Therefore, it is important to be able to predict the
evaporation kinetics of such mixtures. We propose here a new phase-field model
for the simulation of evaporating fluid mixtures and simulate their evaporation
kinetics. Similar to the Hertz-Knudsen theory, the local liquid-vapor
equilibrium is assumed to be reached at the film surface and evaporation is
driven by diffusion away from this gas layer. In the situation where the
evaporation is purely driven by the liquid-vapor equilibrium, the simulations
match the behavior expected theoretically from the free energy: for evaporation
of pure solvents, the evaporation rate is constant and proportional to the
vaporpressure. For mixtures, the evaporation rate is in general strongly
time-dependent because of the changing composition of the film. Nevertheless,
for highly non-ideal mixtures, such as poorly compatible fluids or polymer
solutions, the evaporation rate becomes almost constant in the limit of low
Biot numbers. The results of the simulation have been successfully compared to
experiments on a polystyrene-toluene mixture. The model allows to take into
account deformations of the liquid-vapor interface and therefore to simulate
film roughness or dewetting.

then this task can be transformed into a common supervised learning issue for
solution. However, most mainstream data augmentation based approaches only
consider the single modality information, which leads to the low diversity and
quality of generated features. In this paper, we present a novel multi-modal
data augmentation approach named Dizygotic Conditional Variational AutoEncoder
(DCVAE) for addressing the aforementioned issue. DCVAE conducts feature
synthesis via pairing two Conditional Variational AutoEncoders (CVAEs) with the
same seed but different modality conditions in a dizygotic symbiosis manner.
Subsequently, the generated features of two CVAEs are adaptively combined to
yield the final feature, which can be converted back into its paired conditions
while ensuring these conditions are consistent with the original conditions not
only in representation but also in function. DCVAE essentially provides a new
idea of data augmentation in various multi-modal scenarios by exploiting the
complement of different modality prior information. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate our work achieves state-of-the-art performances on
miniImageNet, CIFAR-FS and CUB datasets, and is able to work well in the

in Sect. 4, loc cit. Yet the main difference is a complete change of emphasis
from the construction of a Weierstrass section, to its application.
  Let $\mathscr N$ be the nilfibre relative to this action. From the
construction of a Weierstrass section $e+V$, it is shown that $e \in \mathscr
N$. Then $P.e$ is contained in a unique irreducible component $\mathscr C$ of
$\mathscr N$. The structure of $e+V$ is used to give a rather explicit
description of $\mathscr C$ as a $B$ saturation set, that is of the form
$\overline{B.\mathfrak u}$, where $\mathfrak u$ is a subalgebra of $\mathfrak
n$ . This algebra is not necessarily complemented by a subalgebra in $\mathfrak
n$ and so $\overline{B.\mathfrak u}$ is not necessarily an orbital variety
closure (hence Lagrangian) but it can be.
  It is shown that $\mathscr C$ need not contain a dense $P$ orbit and this by
a purely theoretical analysis. This occurs for an appropriate parabolic in
$A_{10}$ and is possibly the simplest example. In this particular case
$\mathscr C$ is not an orbital variety closure.

analysis of black hole shadow, and of the black hole observation in particular.
In this paper, we mainly study the shadow and observation characteristics of
noncommutative Schwarzschild black holes wrapped by three accretion models, and
then explore the influence of noncommutative parameters on the observation
appearance and spacetime geometry of black holes. When the black hole is
surrounded by an optically and geometrically thin accretion disk, it shows that
the direct emissions always dominate the total observed intensity, while the
lensing ring superimposed upon the direct emission produces a thin ring, which
improves the observation intensity of the black hole image. However, the photon
rings makes a negligible contributions to the total observed brightness due to
its exponential narrowness, although the photon ring intersects the thin plane
more than three times to pick up larger intensity. More importantly, when the
noncommutative parameters changed, the corresponding regions and observation
intensities of photon ring, lensing ring and direct emission all change
correspondingly. For optical thin spherically symmetric accretion, we consider
the static and infalling matters, respectively. We find that the observation
intensity of the two spherical accretion models increase with the increase of
noncommutative parameters. In addition, due to the Doppler effect of the
infalling movement, the shadow image of infalling accretion is darker than that
of static accretion. In a word, the different accretion models and
noncommutative parameters will lead to different shadow images and optical
appearances of noncommutative Schwarzschild black holes.

techniques, this paper proposes a distributed stochastic algorithm, GT-VR, to
solve large-scale non-convex finite-sum optimization over multi-agent networks.
A complete and rigorous proof shows that the GT-VR algorithm converges to
first-order stationary points with $O(\frac{1}{k})$ convergence rate. In
addition, we provide the complexity analysis of the proposed algorithm.
Compared with some existing first-order methods, the proposed algorithm has a
lower $\mathcal{O}(PM\epsilon^{-1})$ gradient complexity under some mild

aspect is the heterogeneity of disease transmission and progression linked to
the viral load of each infectious individual. Here, we attempt to investigate
the interplay between the evolution of individuals' viral load and the epidemic
dynamics from a theoretical point of view. In the framework of multi-agent
systems, we propose a particle stochastic model describing the infection
transmission through interactions among agents and the individual physiological
course of the disease. Agents have a double microscopic state: a discrete
label, that denotes the epidemiological compartment to which they belong and
switches in consequence of a Markovian process, and a microscopic trait,
representing a normalized measure of their viral load, that changes in
consequence of binary interactions or interactions with a background.
Specifically, we consider Susceptible--Infected--Removed--like dynamics where
infectious individuals may be isolated from the general population and the
isolation rate may depend on the viral load sensitivity and frequency of tests.
We derive kinetic evolution equations for the distribution functions of the
viral load of the individuals in each compartment, whence, via suitable
upscaling procedures, we obtain a macroscopic model for the densities and viral
load momentum. We perform then a qualitative analysis of the ensuing
macroscopic model, and we present numerical tests in the case of both constant

aggregate trends obtained from the macroscopic descriptions and the original
particle dynamics simulated by a Monte Carlo approach is investigated.

miscible and immiscible behaviour within condensed-phase explosives arising
from the co-existence of a reactive carrier mixture of miscible materials, and
several material interfaces due to the presence of immiscible impurities such
as particles or cavities. The dynamic and thermodynamic evolution of the
explosive is communicated to one or more inert confiners through their shared
interfaces, which may undergo severe topological change. We also wish to
consider elastic and plastic structural response of the confiners, rather than
make a hydrodynamic assumption for their behaviour. Previous work by these
authors has met these requirements by means of the simultaneous solution of
appropriate systems of equations for the behaviour of the condensed-phase
explosive and the elastoplastic behaviour of the confiners. In the present
work, we employ a single system of partial differential equations (PDEs)
proposed by Peshkov and Romenski, which is able to account for different states
of matter by means of generalising the concept of distortion tensors beyond
solids. We amalgamate that formulation with a single system of PDEs which meets
the requirement of co-existing miscible and immiscible explosive mixtures. We
present the mathematical derivation and construct appropriate algorithms for
its solution. The resulting model is validated against exact solutions for
several use-cases, including mechanically- and thermally-induced, inviscid and
viscous detonations. Results indicate that the model can accurately simulate a
very broad range of problems involving the nonlinear interaction between
reactive and inert materials within a single framework.

As networks are becoming more and more complex both in general and with the

picture of the network can be, due to intertwining of a vast amount of devices

to conduct security audits, compare documentation with actual conditions or

to change their charge state as a function of the activity of the hydronium

sensitive to salt concentration and composition due to screening and ion
correlations. Given the importance of electrostatic interactions, a reliable
and straightforward theory of charge regulation would be of utmost importance.
This paper presents such a theory that accounts for salt screening, site and

images unrealistic. These issues can be summarized as the inconsistency between
foreground and background, which includes appearance inconsistency (e.g.,
incompatible illumination), geometry inconsistency (e.g., unreasonable size),
and semantic inconsistency (e.g., mismatched semantic context). Previous works
divide image composition task into multiple sub-tasks, in which each sub-task
targets at one or more issues. Specifically, object placement aims to find
reasonable scale, location, and shape for the foreground. Image blending aims
to address the unnatural boundary between foreground and background. Image
harmonization aims to adjust the illumination statistics of foreground. Shadow
generation aims to generate plausible shadow for the foreground. By putting all
the abovementioned efforts together, we can acquire realistic composite images.

recently been shown to be significant even at low redshifts ($z \sim 2$). This
memory of reionization survives cosmological time scales because high-entropy
mean-density gas is heated to $\sim 3\times10^4$ K by reionization, which is
inhomogeneous, and subsequent shocks from denser regions. In the near future,
the first measurements of the Ly$\alpha$ forest 3D power spectrum will be very
likely achieved by upcoming observational efforts such as the Dark Energy
Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). In addition to abundant cosmological
information, these observations have the potential to extract the astrophysics
of reionization from the Ly$\alpha$ forest. We forecast, for the first time,
the accuracy with which the measurements of Ly$\alpha$ forest 3D power spectrum
can place constraints on the reionization parameters with DESI. Specifically,
we demonstrate that the constraints on the ionization efficiency, $\zeta$, and
the threshold mass for haloes that host ionizing sources, $m_{\rm turn}$, will
have the $1\sigma$ error at the level of $\zeta = 25.0 \pm 11.6$ and $\log_{10}
(m_{\rm turn}/{\rm M}_\odot) = 8.7^{+0.36}_{-0.70}$, respectively. The
Ly$\alpha$ forest 3D power spectrum will thus provide an independent probe of
reionization, probably even earlier in detection with DESI, with a sensitivity
only slightly worse than the upcoming 21 cm power spectrum measurement with the
Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), i.e.\ $\sigma_{\rm DESI} /
\sigma_{\rm HERA} \approx 1.5$ for $\zeta$ and $\sigma_{\rm DESI}/\sigma_{\rm
HERA} \approx 2.0$ for $\log_{10}(m_{\rm turn} / $M$_\odot)$. Nevertheless, the
Ly$\alpha$ forest constraint will be improved about three times tighter than
the current constraint from reionization observations with high-z galaxy
priors.

produce their flow rate owing to different external drivers, pressure gradient
and shear respectively. By looking at integral energy fluxes, we pose and
answer the question of which flow performs better at creating flow rate. We
define a flow {\em efficiency}, that quantifies the fraction of power used to
produce flow rate instead of being wasted as a turbulent overhead; {\em
effectiveness}, instead, describes the amount of flow rate produced by a given
power. The work by Gatti \emph{et al.} (\emph{J. Fluid Mech.} vol.857, 2018,
pp. 345--373), where the constant power input (CPI) concept was developed to
compare turbulent Poiseuille flows with drag reduction, is here extended to
compare different flows. By decomposing the mean velocity field into a laminar
contribution and a deviation, analytical expressions are derived which are the
energy-flux equivalents of the FIK identity. These concepts are applied to
literature data supplemented by a new set of direct numerical simulations, to
find that Couette flows are less efficient but more effective than Poiseuille
ones. The reason is traced to the more effective laminar component of Couette
flows, which compensates for their higher turbulent activity. It is also
observed that, when the fluctuating fields of the two flows are fed with the
same total power fraction, Couette flows dissipate a smaller percentage of it
via turbulent dissipation. A decomposition of the fluctuating field into large
and small scales explains this feature: Couette flows develop stronger
large-scale structures, which alter the mean flow while contributing less
significantly to dissipation.

tidal curvature on accelerated probes, revealing some novel insights into the
role of absolute vs. tidal acceleration in the response of such probes. The key
quantity we evaluate is the relation between geodesic ($\tau_{\rm geod}$) and
proper time ($\tau_{\rm acc}$) intervals between events on the probe
trajectory.
  This is obtained as a covariant power series in curvature using a combination
of analytical and numerical tools. A serendipitous observation then reveals
that one can $exactly$ sum all terms involving the $purely\;tidal$ component
${\mathscr E}_n= R_{abcd} \varepsilon^{ab} \varepsilon^{cd}$ of curvature, with
$\varepsilon^{ab}$ the bi-normal to the plane of motion: $$ \tau_{\rm geod} =
\frac{2}{\sqrt{{-\mathscr E}_n}} \sinh ^{-1}\Biggl[\sqrt{\frac{-{\mathscr
E}_n}{a^2-{\mathscr E}_n}} \sinh \left(\frac{1}{2} \sqrt{a^2-{\mathscr E}_n} \;
\tau_{\rm acc} \right) \Biggl] $$ For classical clocks, the above result
represents an interesting closed form contribution of tidal curvature to the
differential ageing of twins in the classic $Twin\;paradox$. For quantum
probes, it gives a thermal contribution to the $detector\;response$ with a
modified $Unruh\;temperature$ $$ [k_{\rm B} T]_{{\mathscr E}_n} = \frac{\hbar
\sqrt{a^2- {\mathscr E}_n }}{2 \pi} $$ As an operational tool, the
computational framework we present and the corresponding results should find
applications to a wide range of physical problems that involve measurements and
observations by use of accelerated probes in curved spacetimes.

as radar, ultrasound, and time of flight imaging. Due to their finite degrees
of freedom, FRI signals can be sampled at sub-Nyquist rates using appropriate
sampling kernels and reconstructed using sparse-recovery algorithms. Typically,
Fourier samples of the FRI signals are used for reconstruction. The
reconstruction quality depends on the choice of Fourier samples and recovery
method. In this paper, we consider to jointly optimize the choice of Fourier
samples and reconstruction parameters. Our framework is a combination of a
greedy subsampling algorithm and a learning-based sparse recovery method.
Unlike existing techniques, the proposed algorithm can flexibly handle changes
in the sampling rate and does not suffer from differentiability issues during
training. Importantly, exact knowledge of the FRI pulse is not required.
Numerical results show that, for a given number of samples, the proposed joint
design leads to lower reconstruction error for FRI signals compared to
independent data-driven design methods for both noisy and clean samples. Our
learning to sample approach can be readily applied to other sampling setups as
well including compressed sensing problems.

demonstrated that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods

suppressed. This is documented by a rapid decrease in both Neel temperature and
the critical field of the metamagnetic transition with decreasing Ir

our understanding of strongly correlated materials and may play a key role in

hole-like defects through an antiferromagnet has been of particular importance.
It creates magnetic frustrations that lead to the formation of a quasiparticle,
whose complex structure continues to pose substantial challenges to theory and
numerical simulations. In this article, we develop a non-perturbative
theoretical approach to describe the microscopic properties of such magnetic
polarons. Based on the self-consistent Born approximation, which is provenly
accurate in the strong-coupling regime, we obtain a complete description of the
polaron wave function by solving a set of Dyson-like equations that permit to
compute relevant spin-hole correlation functions. We apply this new method to
analyze the spatial structure of magnetic polarons in the strongly interacting
regime and find qualitative differences from predictions of previously applied
truncation schemes. Our calculations reveal a remarkably high spatial symmetry
of the polaronic magnetization cloud and a surprising misalignment between its
orientation and the polaron crystal momentum. The developed framework opens up
an approach to the microscopic properties of doped quantum magnets and will
enable detailed analyses of ongoing experiments based on cold-atom quantum

trapping and immobilization of objects such as particles, droplets or cells in
microfluidic devices has been an intense area of research and engineering so
far. Either being passive or active, these microfluidic devices are usually
composed of arrays of elementary traps with various levels of sophistication.
For a given array, it is important to have an efficient and fast immobilization
of the highest number of objects, while optimizing the spatial homogeneity of
the trapping over the whole chip. For passive devices, this has been achieved
with two-layers structures, making the fabrication process more complex. In
this work, we designed small microfluidic traps by single-layer direct laser
writing into a photoresist, and we show that even in this simplest case, the
orientation of the main flow of particles with respect to the traps have a
drastic effect on the trapping efficiency and homogeneity. To better understand
this phenomenon, we have considered two different flow geometries: parallel and
oblique with respect to the traps array, and compared quantitatively the
immobilization of particles with various sizes and densities. Using image
analysis, we show that diagonal flows gives a spatial distribution of the trap
loading that is more homogeneous over the whole chip as compared to the
straight ones, and by performing FEM and trapping simulation, we propose a
qualitative explanation of this phenomenon.

  Space Weather and Space Climate (JSWSC)",,"10.1051/swsc/2021026",,"physics.space-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Erroneous GNSS positioning, failures in spacecraft operations and power
outages due to geomagnetically induced currents are severe threats originating
from space weather. Having knowledge of potential impacts on modern society in
advance is key for many end-user applications. This covers not only the timing
of severe geomagnetic storms but also predictions of substorm onsets at polar
latitudes. In this study we aim at contributing to the timing problem of space
weather impacts and propose a new method to predict the solar wind propagation
delay between Lagrangian point L1 and the Earth based on machine learning,
specifically decision tree models. The propagation delay is measured from the
identification of interplanetary discontinuities detected by the Advanced
Composition Explorer (ACE) and their subsequent sudden commencements in the
magnetosphere recorded by ground-based magnetometers. A database of the
propagation delay has been constructed on this principle including 380
interplanetary shocks. The feature set consists of six features, the three
components of each the solar wind speed and position of ACE around L1. The
machine learning results are compared to the flat propagation delay and the
method based on the normal vector of solar wind discontinuities (vector delay).
The ML model achieves an RMSE of 4.5 min with respect to the measured solar
wind propagation delay and also outperforms the physical flat and vector delay
models by 50 \% and 15 \% respectively. To increase the confidence in the
predictions of the trained GB model, we perform a performance validation,
provide feature importance and analyse the feature impact on the model output
with Shapley values. The major advantage of the machine learning approach is
its simplicity when it comes to its application. After training, input from
only one ACE datapoint have to be fed into the algorithm for a prediction.

(SRG) observatory combines a large field of view and collecting area in the
energy range $\sim$0.2 to $\sim$8.0 keV with the capability to perform uniform
scanning observations of large sky areas.
  Aims. SRG/eROSITA performed scanning observations of the $\sim$140 square
degrees eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS) field as part of its
performance verification phase. The observing time was chosen to slightly
exceed the depth of equatorial fields after the completion of the eROSITA
all-sky survey. We present a catalog of detected X-ray sources in the eFEDS
field providing source positions and extent information, as well as fluxes in
multiple energy bands and document a suite of tools and procedures developed
for eROSITA data processing and analysis, validated and optimized by the eFEDS
work.
  Methods. A multi-stage source detection procedure was optimized and
calibrated by performing realistic simulations of the eROSITA eFEDS
observations. We cross-matched the eROSITA eFEDS source catalog with previous
XMM-ATLAS observations, confirming excellent agreement of the eROSITA and
XMM-ATLAS source fluxes.
  Result. We present a primary catalog of 27910 X-ray sources, including 542
with significant spatial extent, detected in the 0.2-2.3 keV energy range with
detection likelihoods $\ge 6$, corresponding to a (point source) flux limit of
$\approx 6.5 \times 10^{-15}$ erg/cm$^2$/s in the 0.5-2.0 keV energy band (80%
completeness). A supplementary catalog contains 4774 low-significance source
candidates with detection likelihoods between 5 and 6. In addition, a hard band
sample of 246 sources detected in the energy range 2.3-5.0 keV above a
detection likelihood of 10 is provided. The dedicated data analysis software
package, calibration database, and calibrated data products are described in an
appendix.

is designed to provide the first eROSITA-selected sample of galaxy clusters and
groups and to test the predictions for the all-sky survey in the context of
cosmological studies with clusters. In the 140 deg$^2$ area covered by eFEDS,
542 candidate clusters and groups are detected as extended X-ray sources, down
to a flux of $\sim10^{-14} $erg/s/cm$^2$ in the soft band (0.5-2 keV) within
1'. In this work, we provide the catalog of candidate galaxy clusters and
groups in eFEDS. We perform imaging and spectral analysis on the eFEDS clusters
with eROSITA X-ray data, and study the properties of the sample. The clusters
are distributed in the redshift range [0.01, 1.3], with the median redshift at
0.35. We obtain the ICM temperature measurement with $>2\sigma$ c.l. for
$\sim$1/5 (102/542) of the sample. The average temperature of these clusters is
$\sim$2 keV. Radial profiles of flux, luminosity, electron density, and gas
mass are measured from the precise modeling of the imaging data. The selection
function, the purity and completeness of the catalog are examined and discussed
in detail. The contamination fraction is $\sim1/5$ in this sample, dominated by
misidentified point sources. The X-ray Luminosity Function of the clusters
agrees well with the results obtained from other recent X-ray surveys. We also
find 19 supercluster candidates in eFEDS, most of which are located at
redshifts between 0.1 and 0.5. The eFEDS cluster and group catalog provides a
benchmark proof-of-concept for the eROSITA All-Sky Survey extended source

for cluster science and expect no significant deviations from our pre-launch
expectations for the final All-Sky Survey.

  This paper presents the identification of the counterparts to the

For the identification of the counterparts we combined the results from two

strategies to identify the stars among other source categories. We focus here
on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Bayesian approaches, and our approaches are
based on a cross-match with the Gaia catalog, which will eventually contain
counterparts to virtually all stellar eROSITA sources. We estimate that 2060
stars are among the eFEDS sources based on the geometric match distance
distribution, and we identify the 2060 most likely stellar sources with the SVM
and Bayesian methods, the latter being named HamStars in the eROSITA context.
Both methods reach completeness and reliability percentages of almost 90%, and
the agreement between both methods is, incidentally, also about 90%. Knowing
the true number of stellar sources allowed us to derive association
probabilities $p_{ij}$ for the SVM method similar to the Bayesian method so
that one can construct samples with defined completeness and reliability
properties using appropriate cuts in $p_{ij}$. The thus identified stellar
sources show the typical characteristics known for magnetically active stars,
specifically, they are generally compatible with the saturation level, show a
large spread in activity for stars of spectral F to G, and have comparatively
high fractional X-ray luminosities for later spectral types.

mission in July 2019, eROSITA, the soft X-ray instrument aboard SRG, performed
scanning observations of a large contiguous field, namely the eROSITA Final
Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS), ahead of the planned four-year all-sky survey.
eFEDS yielded a large sample of X-ray sources with very rich multi-band
photometric and spectroscopic coverage. Aims: We present here the eFEDS Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN) catalog and the eROSITA X-ray spectral properties of the
eFEDS sources. Methods: Using a Bayesian method, we perform a systematic X-ray
spectral analysis for all eFEDS sources. The appropriate model is chosen based
on the source classification and the spectral quality, and, in the case of AGN,
including the possibility of intrinsic (rest-frame) absorption and/or soft
excess emission. Hierarchical Bayesian modeling (HBM) is used to estimate the
spectral parameter distribution of the sample. Results: X-ray spectral
properties are presented for all eFEDS X-ray sources. There are 21952 candidate
AGN, which comprise 79% of the eFEDS sample. Despite a large number of faint
sources with low photon counts, our spectral fitting provides meaningful
measurements of fluxes, luminosities, and spectral shapes for a majority of the
sources. This AGN catalog is dominated by X-ray unobscured sources, with an
obscured (logNH>21.5) fraction of 10% derived by HBM. The power-law slope of
the catalog can be described by a Gaussian distribution of 1.94+-0.22. Above a
photon counts threshold of 500, nine out of 50 AGN have soft excess detected.
For the sources with blue UV to optical color (type-I AGN), the X-ray emission
is well correlated with the UV emission with the usual anti-correlation between
the X-ray to UV spectral slope {\alpha}_{OX} and the UV luminosity.

candidate clusters were detected in this field, down to a flux limit $F_X \sim

radio-mode feedback in galaxy clusters, we study the radio emission of
brightest cluster galaxies of eFEDS clusters, and we relate it to the X-ray
properties of the host cluster. Using LOFAR we identify 227 radio galaxies
hosted in the BCGs of the 542 galaxy clusters and groups detected in eFEDS. We
treat non-detections as radio upper limits. We analyse the properties of radio
galaxies, such as redshift and luminosity distribution, offset from the cluster
centre, largest linear size and radio power. We study their relation to the
intracluster medium of the host cluster. We perform statistical tests to deal
with upper limits on the radio luminosities. BCGs with radio-loud AGN are more
likely to lie close to the cluster centre than radio-quiet BCGs. There is a
clear relation between the cluster's X-ray luminosity and the radio power of
the BCG. Statistical tests indicate that this correlation is not produced by
selection effects in the radio band. We see no apparent link between largest
linear size of the radio galaxy and central density of the host cluster.
Converting the radio luminosity to kinetic luminosity, we find that radiative
losses of the intracluster medium are in an overall balance with the heating
provided by the central AGN. Finally, we tentatively classify our objects into
disturbed and relaxed, and we show that the link between the AGN and the ICM
apparently holds regardless of the dynamical state of the cluster.

the feedback process to a short, luminous, obscured, and dust-enshrouded phase
during which the accretion rate of the SMBH is expected to be at its maximum
and the associated AGN-driven winds are also predicted to be maximally
developed. To test this scenario, we have isolated a text-book candidate from
the eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey (eFEDS) obtained within the
Performance and Verification program of the eROSITA telescope on board Spectrum
Roentgen Gamma. From an initial catalog of 246 hard X-ray selected sources
matched with the photometric and spectroscopic information available within the
eROSITA and Hyper Suprime-Cam consortia, three candidates Quasars in the
feedback phase have been isolated applying the diagnostic proposed in Brusa et
al. (2015). Only one source (eFEDSU J091157.5+014327) has a spectrum already
available (from SDSS-DR16, z=0.603) and it unambiguously shows the presence of
a broad component (FWHM~1650 km/s) in the [OIII]5007 line. The associated
observed L_[OIII] is ~2.6x10^{42} erg/s, one to two orders of magnitude larger
than that observed in local Seyferts and comparable to those observed in a
sample of z~0.5 Type 1 Quasars. From the multiwavelength data available we
derive an Eddington Ratio (L_bol/L_Edd) of ~0.25, and a bolometric correction
in the hard X-ray of k_bol~10, lower than those observed for objects at similar
bolometric luminosity. The presence of an outflow, the high X-ray luminosity
and moderate X-ray obscuration (L_X~10^44.8 erg/s, N_H~2.7x10^22 cm^-2) and the
red optical color, all match the prediction of quasars in the feedback phase
from merger driven models. Forecasting to the full eROSITA all-sky survey with
its spectroscopic follow-up, we predict that by the end of 2024 we will have a
sample of few hundreds such objects at z=0.5-2.

X-ray binaries (XRBs) and the hot interstellar medium at the full depth of
eRASS:8. We use the Heraklion Extragalactic Catalogue (HECATE) of galaxies to
correlate with eFEDS X-ray sources and identify 94 X-ray detected normal
galaxies. We classify galaxies as star-forming, early-type, composite, and AGN
using SDSS and 6dF optical spectroscopy. The eFEDS field harbours 37 normal
galaxies: 36 late-type (star-forming) galaxies and 1 early-type galaxy. There
are 1.9 times as many normal galaxies as predicted by scaling relations via
SIXTE simulations, with an overabundance of late-type galaxies and a dearth of
early-type galaxies. Dwarf galaxies with high specific star formation rate
(SFR) have elevated L$_{\text{X}}$/SFR when compared with specific SFR and
metallicity, indicating an increase in XRB emission due to low-metallicity. We
expect that eRASS:8 will detect 12,500 normal galaxies, the majority of which
will be star-forming, with the caveat that there are unclassified sources in
eFEDS and galaxy catalogue incompleteness issues that could increase the actual
number of detected galaxies over these current estimates. eFEDS observations
detected a rare population of galaxies -- the metal-poor dwarf starbursts --
that do not follow known scaling relations. eRASS is expected to discover
significant numbers of these high-redshift analogues, which are important for
studying the heating of the intergalactic medium at high-redshift.

the AGN blows out the surrounding material from the nuclear region. Thanks to
the wide area coverage of eFEDS, we have been able to constrain the ranges of
the physical properties of the WISE W4 sample of AGNs at $z < 4$, providing a

satellite has started to detect new X-ray sources over the full sky at an
unprecedented rate. Understanding the performance and selection function of the
source detection is important for the subsequent scientific analysis of the
eROSITA catalogs. Through simulations, we test and optimize the eROSITA source
detection procedures, and we characterize the detected catalog quantitatively.
Taking the eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey (eFEDS) as an example, we ran
extensive photon-event simulations based on our best knowledge of the
instrument characteristics, the background spectrum, and the population of
astronomical X-ray sources. We introduce a method of analyzing source detection
completeness, purity, and efficiency based on the origin of each photon.
According to the source detection efficiency measured in the simulation, we
chose a two-pronged strategy to build eROSITA X-ray catalogs, creating a main
catalog using only the most sensitive band (0.2-2.3 keV) and an independent
hard-band-selected catalog using multiband detection in a range up to 5 keV.
Because our mock data are highly representative of the real eFEDS data, we used
the mock catalogs to measure the completeness and purity of the eFEDS catalogs
as a function of multiple parameters, such as detection likelihood, flux, and
luminosity. These measurements provide a basis for choosing the eFEDS catalog
selection thresholds. The mock catalogs (available with this paper) can be used
to construct the selection function of active galactic nuclei and galaxy
clusters. A direct comparison of the output and input mock catalogs also gives
rise to a correction curve that converts the raw point-source flux distribution
into the intrinsic number counts distribution.

the spectrum of the diffuse X-ray emission in the observed fields to determine
the physical properties of the hot phase of the interstellar medium (ISM). The
eROSITA data are complemented by newly derived column density maps for the
Milky Way and the LMC, 888 MHz radio continuum map from the Australian Square
Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), and optical images of the Magellanic Cloud
Emission Line Survey (MCELS). We detect significant emission from thermal
plasma with kT=0.2 keV in all the regions. There is also an additional
higher-temperature emission component from a plasma with kT = 0.7 keV. In
addition, non-thermal X-ray emission is significantly detected in the
superbubble 30 Dor C. The absorbing column density NH in the LMC derived from
the analysis of the X-ray spectra taken with eROSITA is consistent with the NH
obtained from the emission of the cold medium over the entire area. Neon
abundance is enhanced in the regions in and around 30 Dor and SN 1987A,
indicating that the ISM has been chemically enriched by the young stellar
population. Emission from the stellar cluster RMC 136 and the Wolf-Rayet stars
RMC 139 and RMC 140 is best modelled with a high-temperature (kT>1 keV)
non-equilibrium ionisation plasma emission and a non-thermal component with a
photon index of {\Gamma} =1.3. In addition, the optical SNR candidate
J0529-7004 is also detected with eROSITA and we thus confirm the source as an

SRG/eROSITA also observed the source during its commissioning phase and the
first light in Sept. and Oct. 2019. We investigated the spectral and flux
evolution of SN 1987A in X-rays over the last fourteen years up to Nov. 2020
using XMM-Newton and eROSITA observations. We performed a detailed spectral
analysis using a three-component plane-parallel shock model and analysed and
modelled the EPIC-pn monitoring and eROSITA observations in a consistent
manner. This paper reports a complete and most up to date flux evolution of SN
1987A in the soft (0.5-2 keV) and hard (3-10 keV) X-ray band. The flux in the
soft band flattened around 9424 d and then displayed a turnover between
10142-10493 d after which it showed a continued decline. Around the same time,
a break in the hard-band flux time evolution slope was detected. This implies
that the blast wave has now passed beyond the dense structures of the
equatorial ring and is expanding further into more tenuous circumstellar
medium. The temporal evolution of the normalizations of the three shock
components match well the results of hydrodynamical simulations predicting a
blue supergiant progenitor scenario. The trend at recent epochs indicate that
the emission caused by the forward shock after leaving the equatorial ring and
by the reverse shock in the ejecta is becoming more dominant now. The elemental
abundances in the hot plasma component are significantly higher than those in
the `cooler' one, indicating its origin from the reverse shock propagating into
the ejecta.

firstly established an X-ray ephemeris for the time interval 2015 to 2020,
which connects all X-ray observations in this period without cycle count alias
and phase shifts. The mean eROSITA spectrum clearly reveals an absorption
feature originating from the star at 570 eV with a Gaussian sigma of about 70
eV, tentatively identified earlier in a long XMM-Newton observation
(Arumugasamy et al. 2018). A second absorption feature, described here as an
absorption edge, occurs at 260-265 eV. It could be of atmospheric or of
instrumental origin. These absorption features are superposed on various
emission components, phenomenologically described as the sum of hot (120 eV)
and cold (65 eV) blackbody components, both of photospheric origin, and a
power-law with photon index Gamma=2. The phase-resolved spectroscopy reveals
that the Gaussian absorption line at 570 eV is clearly present throughout ~60%
of the spin cycle. The visibility of the line strength coincides in phase with
the maximum flux of the hot blackbody. We also present three families of model
atmospheres: a magnetised atmosphere, a condensed surface, and a mixed model,
which were applied to the mean observed spectrum and whose continuum fit the
observed data well. The atmosphere model, however, predicts too short
distances. For the mixed model, the Gaussian absorption may be interpreted as
proton cyclotron absorption in a field as high as 10^14 G, which is
significantly higher than that derived from the moderate observed spin-down.

between the core and one or more groups towards the west. We compute spatially
resolved spectroscopic maps of the thermodynamic properties of the cluster,
including the metallicity. The merging subclusters are seen as low entropy
material within the cluster. The filamentary structures could be the rims of a
powerful outburst of an active galactic nucleus, or most likely material
stripped from the western group(s) as they passed through the cluster core.
Seen in two directions is a pressure jump at a radius of 1.1 Mpc, which is
consistent with a shock with a Mach number of ~1.5-1.7. The eROSITA data
confirm that the cluster is not a simple merging system, but it is made up of
several subclusters which are merging or will shortly merge. We computed a
hydrostatic mass from the eROSITA data, finding good agreement with a previous
XMM-Newton result. With this pointing we detect several extended sources, where
we find secure associations between z=0.36-1.0 for seven of them, that is
background galaxy groups and clusters, highlighting the power of eROSITA to

binaries (HMXBs), and all but one (SMC X-1) have a Be companion star. Through
the calibration and verification phase of eROSITA on board the
Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) spacecraft, the Be/X-ray binary XMMU
J010429.4-723136 was in the field of view during observations of the supernova
remnant, 1E0102.2-7219, used as a calibration standard.
  Aims. We report timing and spectral analyses of XMMU J010429.4-723136 based
on three eROSITA observations of the field, two of which were performed on 2019
November 7-9, with the third on 2020 June 18-19. We also reanalyse the OGLE-IV
light curve for that source in order to determine the orbital period.
  Methods. We performed a Lomb-Scargle periodogram analysis to search for
pulsations (from the X-ray data) and for the orbital period (from the OGLE
data). X-ray spectral parameters and fluxes were retrieved from the best-fit
model.
  Results. We detect, for the first time, the pulsations of XMMU
J010429.4-723136 at a period of ~164 s, and therefore designate the source as
SXP 164. From the spectral fitting, we derive a source flux of ~1x10e-12 erg
s-1 cm-2 for all three observations, corresponding to a luminosity of ~4x10e35
erg s-1 at the distance of the SMC. Furthermore, reanalysing the OGLE light
curve, including the latest observations, we find a significant periodic signal
that we believe is likely be the orbital period; at 22.3d, this is shorter than
the previously reported values. The Swift/XRT light curve, extracted from two
long monitorings of the field and folded at the same period, suggests that a
modulation is also present in the X-ray data.

its fortuitous location in the vicinity of the southern ecliptic pole, AB~Dor
was observed by these missions simultaneously for almost 20 days. With the
hitherto obtained data we study the long-term evolution of the X-ray flux from
AB~Dor and the relation between this observable and the photospheric activity
of its spots. Over the 1.5 years of eROSITA survey observations, the
""quiescent"" X-ray flux of AB~Dor has not changed, and furthermore it appears
unrelated to the photospheric modulations observed by TESS. During the
simultaneous eROSITA and TESS coverage, an extremely large flare event with a
total energy release of at least 4 $\times$ 10$^{36}$ erg in the optical was
observed, the largest ever seen on AB~Dor. We show that the total X-ray output
of this flare was far smaller than this, and discuss whether this maybe a
general feature of flares on late-type stars.

while ground-based photometry indicated periodic variability at 32 min. Located
in very sparsely populated regions of color-magnitude diagrams involving X-ray

underluminous magnetic CV, an intermediate polar, or an overluminous
nonmagnetic CV. The lack of uniquely identified spin and orbital periods
prevents a final classification. The site of X-ray production in the system,

can accrete considerably far from periastron, although it is expected to be
outside of the circumstellar disk, thus providing important new information
about the plasma environment surrounding the binary system. We also report the
results from the photometric monitoring of A0538-66 carried out with the REM,

pair, to connect simulation predictions to the SRG/eROSITA X-ray observations
of the Abell 3391/95 field. The simulated system has been extracted from the
(352 cMpc/h)^3 volume of the Magneticum Pathfinder cosmological simulations at
z=0.07. We tracked back in time the main progenitors of the pair clusters and
surrounding groups to study the assembly history of the system and its
evolution. Similarly to the observed A3391/95 system, the simulated pair is
embedded in a complex network of gas filaments, with structures aligned over
more than 20 projected Mpc and the whole region collapsing towards the central
overdense node. The spheres of influence (3*R200) of the two main clusters
already overlap at z=0.07, but their virial boundaries are still physically
separated. The diffuse gas located in the interconnecting bridge closely
reflects the WHIM, with typical temperature of ~1 keV and overdensity $\sim
100$, with respect to the mean baryon density of the Universe, and lower
enrichment level compared to the ICM in clusters. We find that most of the
bridge gas collapsed from directions roughly orthogonal to the intra-cluster
gas accretion directions, and its origin is mostly unrelated to the two cluster
progenitors. We find clear signatures in the surrounding groups of infall
motion towards the pair, such as significant radial velocities and slowdown of
gas compared to dark matter. These findings further support the picture of the
Northern Clump (MCXC J0621.7-5242) cluster infalling along a cosmic gas
filament towards Abell 3391, possibly merging with it. We conclude that, in
such a configuration, the pair clusters of the A3391/95-like system are in a
pre-merger phase, and did not interact yet. The diffuse gas in the
interconnecting bridge is mostly warm filament gas, rather than
tidally-stripped cluster gas.

filament in soft X-rays, similarly to what has been seen in simulations before.
We aim to understand the dynamical state of the Northern Clump as it enters the
atmosphere ($3\times R_{200}$) of A3391. We analyzed joint eROSITA, XMM-Newton,
and Chandra observations to probe the morphological, thermal, and chemical
properties of the Northern Clump from its center out to a radius of 988 kpc
($R_{200}$). We utilized the ASKAP/EMU radio data, DECam optical image, and
Planck y-map to study the influence of the WAT radio source on the Northern
Clump central ICM. From the Magneticum simulation, we identified an analog of
the A3391/95 system along with an infalling group resembling the Northern
Clump. The Northern Clump is a WCC cluster centered on a WAT radio galaxy. The
gas temperature over $0.2-0.5R_{500}$ is $k_BT_{500}=1.99\pm0.04$ keV. We
employed the $M-T$ scaling relation and obtained a mass estimate of
$M_{500}=(7.68\pm0.43)\times10^{13}M_{\odot}$ and $R_{500}=(636\pm12)$ kpc. Its
atmosphere has a boxy shape and deviates from spherical symmetry. We identify a
southern surface brightness edge, likely caused by subsonic motion relative to
the filament gas. At $\sim\! R_{500}$, the southern atmosphere appears to be
42% hotter than its northern atmosphere. We detect a downstream tail pointing
toward the north with a projected length of $\sim318$ kpc, plausibly the result
of ram pressure stripping. The analog group in the Magneticum simulation is
experiencing changes in its gas properties and a shift between the position of
the halo center and that of the bound gas while approaching the main cluster
pair.

has not been observed by any modern X-ray observatory. A neighbouring cluster
in NW direction, A3407 ($z=0.0428$), appears to be close at least in projection
($\sim 1.7$ Mpc). This cluster pair could be in a pre- or post-merger state.
  We perform a detailed X-ray analysis of A3408. We construct particle
background subtracted and exposure corrected images and surface brightness
profiles in different sectors. The spectral analysis is performed out to
$1.4r_{500}$. Additionally, a temperature map is presented depicting the
distribution of the ICM temperature. Furthermore, we make use of data from the
RASS to estimate some bulk properties of A3408 and A3407, using the growth
curve analysis method and scaling relations.
  The imaging analysis shows a complex morphology of A3408 with a strong
elongation in SE-NW direction. This is quantified by comparing the surface
brightness profiles of the NW, SW, SE and NE directions, where the NW and SE
directions show a significantly higher surface brightness compared to the other
directions. We determine a gas temperature ${\rm k_B}T_{500}=(2.23\pm0.09)$
keV. The T-profile reveals a hot core within $2'$ of the emission peak, ${\rm
k_B}T=3.04^{+0.29}_{-0.25}$ keV. Employing a M-T relation, we obtain
$M_{500}=(9.27\pm0.75)\times 10^{13}M_{\odot}$ iteratively. The $r_{200}$ of
A3407 and A3408 are found to overlap in projection which makes ongoing
interactions plausible. The 2d T-map reveals higher temperatures in W than in E
direction.
  A3407 and A3408 are likely in a pre-merger state, affecting the ICM
properties, i.e., increased temperatures in the direction of A3407 indicate
adiabatic compression or shocks due to the interaction.

indicators does not improve when the simultaneously measured data are used. A
more detailed analysis shows that the correlation of log(L_X/L_bol) to log(R+)
measurements of the pseudo-simultaneous data still has a high probability of
being better than that of a random set of non-simultaneous measurements with a
long time baseline between the observations. Cyclic variations on longer

flares, regarding the addition of ""noise"" to the activity flux-flux
correlations. Finally, regarding the question of predictability of necessarily

first all-sky survey of the extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope
Array (eROSITA) onboard the Russian Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission. We
use three publicly available input catalogs of spectroscopically confirmed UCDs
and Gaia-selected UCD candidates that together comprise nearly 20000 objects.
We first extracted all X-ray sources from the catalog of the first eROSITA
survey, eRASS1, that have a UCD or candidate within three times their
positional uncertainty. Then we examined all Gaia objects in the vicinity of
these 96 X-ray sources and we associated them to the most plausible counterpart
on the basis of their spatial separation to the X-ray position and their
multiwavelength properties. This way we find 40 UCDs that have a secure
identification with an X-ray source and 18 plausible UCD X-ray emitters.
Twenty-one of these X-ray emitting UCDs have a spectroscopic confirmation,
while the others have been selected based on Gaia photometry and we computed
spectral types from the G-J color. The spectral types of the X-ray emitting
UCDs and candidates range between M5 and M9, and the distances range from 3.5
to 190 pc. The majority of the UCDs from the eRASS1 sample show a ratio of
X-ray to bolometric luminosity well above the canonical saturation limit of log
(Lx/Lbol) ~ -3. For the two most extreme outliers, we showed through an
analysis of the eRASS1 light curve that these high values are due to flaring
activity. The X-ray spectra of the two brightest objects both reveal an
emission-measure weighted plasma temperature of kT ~ 0.75 keV. These
observations demonstrate the potential of eROSITA for advancing our knowledge
on the faint coronal X-ray emission from UCDs by building statistical samples
for which the average X-ray brightness, flares, and coronal temperatures can be
derived.

an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) on board the Russian
Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma mission (SRG). To this end we extracted the Gaia DR2
data for the ~9000 nearby M dwarfs in the superblink proper motion catalog and
calculated their stellar parameters from empirical relations with optical-IR
colors. We cross-matched this catalog with the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth
Survey (eFEDS) and the first eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS1). Our sample
consists of 704 stars (SpT = K5-M7). This unprecedented data base for X-ray
emitting M dwarfs allowed to quantitatively constrain the mass dependence of
the X-ray luminosity, and to determine the change in the activity level with
respect to pre-main-sequence stars. We also combined these data with the
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observations that are available
for 501 of 704 X-ray detected M dwarfs and determined the rotation period for
180 of them. With the joint eROSITA-TESS sample, and combining it with our
historical X-ray and rotation data for M dwarfs, we examined the mass
dependence in the saturated regime of the rotation-activity relation. A first
comparison of eROSITA hardness ratios and spectra shows that 65% of our X-ray
detected M dwarfs have coronal temperatures of $\sim 0.5$ keV. We investigated
their long-term X-ray variability by comparing the eRASS1 and ROSAT all-sky
survey (RASS) measurements. Evidence for X-ray flares is found in various parts
of our analysis: directly from inspection of the eFEDS light curves, in the
relation between RASS and eRASS1 X-ray luminosities, and in stars displaying
X-ray emission hotter than the bulk of the sample according to the hardness
ratios. Finally, we point out the need of X-ray spectroscopy for more M dwarfs
to study the coronal temperature-luminosity relation, not well constrained by
our eFEDS results.

by the eROSITA instrument on board the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG)
observatory of the Sco-Cen OB association. Bona fide Sco-Cen member stars are
young and are therefore expected to emit X-rays at the saturation level. The
sensitivity limit of eRASS1 makes these stars detectable down to about a tenth
of a solar mass. By cross-correlating the eRASS1 source catalog with the Gaia
EDR3 catalog, we arrive at a complete identification of the stellar (i.e.,
coronal) source content of eROSITA\ in the Sco-Cen association, and in
particular obtain for the first time a 3D view of the detected stellar X-ray
sources. Focusing on the low-mass population and placing the optical
counterparts identified in this way in a color-magnitude diagram, we can
isolate the young stars out of the detected X-ray sources and obtain age
estimates of the various Sco-Cen populations. A joint analysis of the 2D and 3D
space motions, the latter being available only for a smaller subset of the
detected stellar X-ray sources, reveals that the space motions of the selected
population show a high degree of parallelism, but there is also an additional
population of young, X-ray emitting and essentially cospatial stars that
appears to be more diffuse in velocity space. Its nature is currently unclear.
We argue that with our procedures, an identification of almost the whole
stellar content of the Sco-Cen association will become possible once the final
Gaia and eROSITA catalogs are available by the end of this decade. We
furthermore call into question any source population classification scheme that
relies on purely kinematic selection criteria.

classify whether an HI 21-cm absorption spectrum arises in a source intervening

source redshift. However, not only will this be impractical for the large
number of sources expected to be detected with the Square Kilometre Array, but
bright optical sources are the most ultra-violet luminous at high redshift and
so bias against the detection of cool, neutral gas. Adding another 44, mostly
newly detected absorbers, to the previous sample of 92, we test four different
machine learning algorithms, again using the line properties (width, depth and
number of Gaussian fits) as features. Of these algorithms, three gave a some
improvement over the previous sample, with a logistic regression model giving
the best results. This suggests that the inclusion of further training data, as
new absorbers are detected, will further increase the prediction accuracy above
the current 80%. We use the logistic regression model to classify the z = 0.42
absorption towards PKS 1657-298 and find this to be associated, which is
consistent with a previous study which determined a similar redshift from the

transport. However, key technical challenges, such as safe navigation in
complex urban environments, need to be addressed before deploying these
vehicles on the market. Teleoperation can help smooth the transition from human
operated to fully autonomous vehicles since it still has human in the loop
providing the scope of fallback on driver. This paper presents an Active Safety
System (ASS) approach for teleoperated driving. The proposed approach helps the
operator ensure the safety of the vehicle in complex environments, that is,
avoid collisions with static or dynamic obstacles. Our ASS relies on a model
predictive control (MPC) formulation to control both the lateral and
longitudinal dynamics of the vehicle. By exploiting the ability of the MPC
framework to deal with constraints, our ASS restricts the controller's
authority to intervene for lateral correction of the human operator's commands,
avoiding counter-intuitive driving experience for the human operator. Further,
we design a visual feedback to enhance the operator's trust over the ASS. In
addition, we propose an MPC's prediction horizon data based novel predictive
display to mitigate the effects of large latency in the teleoperation system.
We tested the performance of the proposed approach on a high-fidelity vehicle
simulator in the presence of dynamic obstacles and latency.

Previous attempts to mechanize reasoning using EC faced difficulties in the
treatment of the continuous change in dense domains (e.g., time and other

uniform application of different inference methods, among others. We propose
the use of s(CASP), a query-driven, top-down execution model for Predicate

naively training multiple deep neural networks and combining their predictions
at inference leads to prohibitive computational costs and memory requirements.
Recently proposed efficient ensemble approaches reach the performance of the
traditional deep ensembles with significantly lower costs. However, the
training resources required by these approaches are still at least the same as
training a single dense model. In this work, we draw a unique connection
between sparse neural network training and deep ensembles, yielding a novel
efficient ensemble learning framework called FreeTickets. Instead of training
multiple dense networks and averaging them, we directly train sparse
subnetworks from scratch and extract diverse yet accurate subnetworks during
this efficient, sparse-to-sparse training. Our framework, FreeTickets, is
defined as the ensemble of these relatively cheap sparse subnetworks. Despite
being an ensemble method, FreeTickets has even fewer parameters and training
FLOPs than a single dense model. This seemingly counter-intuitive outcome is
due to the ultra training/inference efficiency of dynamic sparse training.
FreeTickets surpasses the dense baseline in all the following criteria:
prediction accuracy, uncertainty estimation, out-of-distribution (OoD)
robustness, as well as efficiency for both training and inference.
Impressively, FreeTickets outperforms the naive deep ensemble with ResNet50 on
ImageNet using around only 1/5 of the training FLOPs required by the latter. We
have released our source code at https://github.com/VITA-Group/FreeTickets.

crossover leads to a transition to nematic phase. The crossover was interpreted
as due to the onset of a perturbing relevant scaling field originating from the
extra spin degree of freedom. As a counter example and in support of this
hypothesis, we now consider V-shaped bent-core molecules with rigid rod-like
segments connected at an assigned angle. The two segments of the molecule
interact with the segments of all the nearest neighbours on a square lattice,
prescribed by a biquadratic interaction. We compute equilibrium averages of
different observables with Monte Carlo techniques as a function of temperature
and sample size. For the chosen molecular bend angle and symmetric
inter-segment interaction between neighbouirng molecules, the 2D system shows
two transitions as a function of T: the higher one at T1 leads to a topological
ordering of defects associated with the major molecular axis without a
crossover, imparting uniaxial symmetry to the medium described by the first
fundamental group of the order parameter space $\pi_{1}$= $Z_{2}$ (inversion
symmetry). The second at T2 leads to a medium displaying biaxial symmetry with
$\pi_{1}$ = Q (quaternion group). The biaxial phase shows a self-similar
microscopic structure with the three axes showing power law correlations with

a bipartite, continuous Gaussian system. This allows us to derive explicit and
exact formulas for the entanglement entropy, the mutual information and the
quantum discord, solely in terms of the Fourier-space power spectra of the
field. This contrasts with previous studies, which mostly rely on numerical
considerations. As an illustration, we apply our formalism to massless fields
in flat space, where exact expressions are derived that only involve the ratio
between the size of the regions over which the field is coarse-grained, and the
distance between these regions. In particular, we recover the well-known fact
that mutual information decays as the fourth power of this ratio at large
distances, as previously observed in numerical works. Our method leads to the
first analytical derivation of this result, and to an exact formula that also
applies to arbitrary distances. Finally, we determine the quantum discord and
find that it identically vanishes (unless coarse-graining is performed over
smeared spheres, in which case it obeys the same suppression at large distance
as mutual information).

cameras are ubiquitous. In this work, for the first time, we propose a
trainable image acquisition method that removes the sensitive identity
revealing information in the optical domain before it reaches the image sensor.
The method benefits from a trainable optical convolution kernel which transmits
the desired information while filters out the sensitive content. As the
sensitive content is suppressed before it reaches the image sensor, it does not
enter the digital domain therefore is unretrievable by any sort of privacy
attack. This is in contrast with the current digital privacy-preserving methods
that are all vulnerable to direct access attack. Also, in contrast with the
previous optical privacy-preserving methods that cannot be trained, our method
is data-driven and optimized for the specific application at hand. Moreover,
there is no additional computation, memory, or power burden on the acquisition
system since this processing happens passively in the optical domain and can
even be used together and on top of the fully digital privacy-preserving
systems. The proposed approach is adaptable to different digital neural
networks and content. We demonstrate it for several scenarios such as smile
detection as the desired attribute while the gender is filtered out as the
sensitive content. We trained the optical kernel in conjunction with two
adversarial neural networks where the analysis network tries to detect the
desired attribute and the adversarial network tries to detect the sensitive
content. We show that this method can reduce 65.1% of sensitive content when it
is selected to be the gender and it only loses 7.3% of the desired content.
Moreover, we reconstruct the original faces using the deep reconstruction
method that confirms the ineffectiveness of reconstruction attacks to obtain
the sensitive content.

twenty-two sub-element strands are studied from the second successful flight of
NASA's High resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C 2.1). Four of the loops correspond
to open fan structures with the other four considered to be magnetically closed
loops. Width analysis is performed on the loops and their sub-resolution
strands using our method of fitting multiple Gaussian profiles to
cross-sectional intensity slices. It is found that whilst the magnetically
closed loops and their sub-element strands do not expand along their observable
length, open fan structures may expand an additional 150% of their initial
width. Following recent work, the Pearson correlation coefficient between peak
intensity and loop/strand width are found to be predominantly positively
correlated for the loops (~88%) and their sub-element strands (~80%). These
results align with the hypothesis of Klimchuk & DeForest that loops and - for

information on various aspects of these metastable antibranes through
applications of the blackfold effective theory for higher-dimensional black
holes. As concrete examples, we study the conjectured metastable state of
polarised anti-D3 branes at the tip of the Klebanov-Strassler (KS) throat in
type IIB supergravity and the analogous state of polarised anti-M2 branes at
the tip of the Cvetic-Gibbons-Lu-Pope (CGLP) throat in eleven-dimensional
supergravity.
  For anti-D3 branes in KS throat, we provide novel evidence for the existence
of the metastable state exactly where no-go theorems are lifted. In the
extremal limit, we recover directly in supergravity the metastable states
originally discovered by Kachru, Pearson, and Verlinde (KPV). Away from
extremality, we uncover a metastable wrapped black NS5 state. We observe that
such metastability is lost when the wrapped NS5 is heated sufficiently that its
horizon geometry resembles that of a black anti-D3. We study the classical
stability of the KPV state under generic long-wavelength deformations. We
observe that, with regards to considered perturbations and regime of
parameters, the state is classically stable. A study of anti-M2 branes in CGLP
throat reveals many similarities to that of the anti-D3 branes. We recover
directly in supergravity the Klebanov-Pufu (KP) state at extremality, and our
finite temperature results fit suggestively well with known, complementary
no-go theorems. However, we discover an unexpected, exotic pattern of thermal
transitions of the KP state different from that of the KPV.
  This thesis contains also a pedagogical introduction to the blackfold
formalism, focusing on aspects immediately relevant to applications to
metastable antibranes.

responsible of the generalization property, that is extrapolation from learning
data under constraints. The fibers represent pre-semantic categories (Culioli,
Thom), over which artificial languages are defined, with internal logics,
intuitionist, classical or linear (Girard). Semantic functioning of a network
is its ability to express theories in such a language for answering questions
in output about input data. Quantities and spaces of semantic information are
defined by analogy with the homological interpretation of Shannon's entropy of
P.Baudot and D.Bennequin in 2015). They generalize the measures found by Carnap

classified by geometric fibrant objects in a closed model category of Quillen,
then they give rise to homotopical invariants of DNNs and of their semantic
functioning. Intentional type theories (Martin-Loef) organize these objects and
fibrations between them. Information contents and exchanges are analyzed by

methods in optimization. The convergence rate for SGD has been extensively
studied and tight analyses have been established for the running average
scheme, but the sub-optimality of the final iterate is still not
well-understood. shamir2013stochastic gave the best known upper bound for the
final iterate of SGD minimizing non-smooth convex functions, which is $O(\log
T/\sqrt{T})$ for Lipschitz convex functions and $O(\log T/ T)$ with additional
assumption on strongly convexity. The best known lower bounds, however, are
worse than the upper bounds by a factor of $\log T$. harvey2019tight gave
matching lower bounds but their construction requires dimension $d= T$. It was
then asked by koren2020open how to characterize the final-iterate convergence
of SGD in the constant dimension setting.
  In this paper, we answer this question in the more general setting for any
$d\leq T$, proving $\Omega(\log d/\sqrt{T})$ and $\Omega(\log d/T)$ lower
bounds for the sub-optimality of the final iterate of SGD in minimizing
non-smooth Lipschitz convex and strongly convex functions respectively with
standard step size schedules. Our results provide the first general dimension

resolving a COLT open question raised by koren2020open. We also present further
evidence to show the correct rate in one dimension should be
$\Theta(1/\sqrt{T})$, such as a proof of a tight $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ upper bound
for one-dimensional special cases in settings more general than koren2020open.

both capture self-consistent magnetic field topologies as well evolve our
models to late times, a two stage approach is taken. We study the early

that the topology of the field is set by the burning, independent of the
initial strength. We study late time (~1000 days) light curves and spectra with
a variety of magnetic field topologies, and infer magnetic field strengths from
observed supernovae. Lower limits are found to be 106G. This is determined by
the escape, or lack thereof, of positrons that are tied to the magnetic field.
The first stage employs 3d MHD and a local burning approximation, and uses the
code Enzo. The second stage employs a hybrid approach, with 3D radiation and
positron transport, and spherical hydrodynamics. The second stage uses the code
HYDRA. In our models, magnetic field amplification remains small during the

field strength and morphology. Implications for alternative explosion scenarios

image corruption, artifacts, different acquisition protocols or allergies to
certain contrast agents in clinical practice. Though existing efforts
demonstrate the possibility of a unified model for all missing situations, most
of them perform poorly when more than one modality is missing. In this paper,
we propose a novel Adversarial Co-training Network (ACN) to solve this issue,
in which a series of independent yet related models are trained dedicated to
each missing situation with significantly better results. Specifically, ACN
adopts a novel co-training network, which enables a coupled learning process
for both full modality and missing modality to supplement each other's domain
and feature representations, and more importantly, to recover the `missing'
information of absent modalities. Then, two unsupervised modules, i.e., entropy
and knowledge adversarial learning modules are proposed to minimize the domain
gap while enhancing prediction reliability and encouraging the alignment of
latent representations, respectively. We also adapt modality-mutual information
knowledge transfer learning to ACN to retain the rich mutual information among
modalities. Extensive experiments on BraTS2018 dataset show that our proposed
method significantly outperforms all state-of-the-art methods under any missing

historical roots, and next to VOSViewer, which was used as a part of the
synthetic content analysis. In our study we defined synthetic context analysis
as a triangulation of bibliometrics and content analysis. Our search resulted
in 14451 publications. The performance bibliometric study showed that the
production of research publications relating to software quality is currently
following an exponential growth trend and that the software quality research
community is growing. The most productive country was the United States and the
most productive Institution The Florida Atlantic University. The synthetic
content analysis revealed that the published knowledge can be structured into
10 themes, the most important being the themes regarding software quality
improvement with enhancing software engineering, advanced software testing, and
improved defect and fault prediction with machine learning and data mining.
According to the analysis of the hot topics, it seems that future research will
be directed into developing and using a full specter of new artificial

provides flexible modeling of the distributions of potential outcomes, so it is
capable of capturing a variety of underlying relationships among the outcomes,
treatments and confounders and estimating multiple quantile treatment effects
simultaneously. Specifically, this approach uses a Bayesian additive regression
trees (BART) model to estimate the propensity score and a Dirichlet process
mixture (DPM) of multivariate normals model to estimate the conditional
distribution of the potential outcome given the estimated propensity score. The
BNPqte R package provides a fast implementation for this approach by designing
efficient R functions for the DPM of multivariate normals model in joint and
conditional density estimation. These R functions largely improve the
efficiency of the DPM model in density estimation, compared to the popular
DPpackage. BART-related R functions in the BNPqte R package are inherited from
the BART R package with two modifications on variable importance and split
probability. To maximize computational efficiency, the actual sampling and
computation for each model are carried out in C++ code. The Armadillo C++
library is also used for fast linear algebra calculations.

on the shadow is observed. The result shows that when the observer gradually
moves from the poles to the equatorial plane, the shadow radius $R_{\rm s}$
firstly decreases and then increases with the Lorentz-violating parameter. Such
nonmonotonic behavior provides us an important understanding on the black hole
shadow in the Einstein-bumblebee gravity. Besides, three more distortion
observables are calculated, and found to increase with the Lorentz-violating
parameter. Moreover, when a homogeneous plasma is present, the motion of the
photon is analyzed. We further observe that the refractive index shrinks the
size, while enhances the deformation of the shadow. Finally, adopting the
observed data of the diameter of M87$^*$, we find the refractive index is more

important information about the ionization mechanisms, densities, temperatures,
and metallicities in AGN-ionized gas. Photoionization models usually assume
Maxwell-Boltzmann (M-B) electron energy distributions (EED), but it has been
suggested that using kappa distributions may be more appropriate and could
potentially solve the discrepancies in temperatures and abundances found in HII
regions and Planetary Nebulae (PNe). We consider the impact of the presence of
kappa distributions in photoionized nebulae associated with AGN and study how
this might affect spectral modelling and abundance analyses for such regions.
Using the photoionization code MAPPINGS 1e we compute models adopting M-B and
kappa distributions of electron energies, and compare the behaviour of emission
line ratios for different values of kappa, gas metallicity, density, ionization
parameter and SED slope. We find that the choice of EED can have a large impact
on some UV and optical emission lines emitted by photoionized nebulae
associated with AGN, and that the impact of adopting a kappa distribution is
strongly dependent on gas metallicity and ionization parameter. We compile a
sample of line ratios for 143 type 2 AGN and compare our models against the
observed line ratios. We find that for 98 objects kappa distributions provide a
better fit to the observed line ratios than M-B distributions. In addition, we
find that adopting kappa-distributed electron energies results in significant
changes in the inferred gas metallicity and ionization parameter in a
significant fraction of objects.

a set of Hamiltonian exhausting all values of the micro-motion parameter, and
this micro-motion parameter can be viewed as an extra synthetic dimension of

described by a $d+1$-dimensional static Hamiltonian, and the advantage of this
representation is that the periodic boundary condition is automatically imposed
along the extra-dimension, which enables a straightforward definition of
topological invariants. The topological invariant in the $d+1$-dimensional

a. We assume a general polynomial form in $t$ both for $K_{ab}$ and $K_{a}$; b.
We express $K_{ab}$ in a basis of the KTs of order 2 of the kinetic metric

a new system of PDEs whose solution requires that we specify either $\omega(t)$

previous works, our model tackles the case where there is uncertainty on the
attributes characterizing the agents' data -- a critical aspect of the problem
when the number of agents is large. We provide a characterization of the game's

Subsequently, we focus on the asymptotic behavior of the covariance of the
linear regression parameters estimated via generalized least squares as the
number of data sources becomes large. We provide upper and lower bounds for
this covariance matrix and we show that, when the agents' provision costs are
superlinear, the model's covariance converges to zero but at a slower rate
relative to virtually all learning problems with exogenous data. On the other
hand, if the agents' provision costs are linear, this covariance fails to
converge. This shows that even the basic property of consistency of generalized
least squares estimators is compromised when the data sources are strategic.

applications and the fact that it is NP-hard. One of the most successful
approaches, yet arguably underrepresented, is iteratively reweighted least
squares (IRLS), more specifically $\mathrm{IRLS}$-$0$. Despite comprehensive
empirical evidence that it overall outperforms nuclear norm minimization and
related methods, it is still not understood to a satisfying degree. In
particular, the significance of a slow decrease of the therein appearing
regularization parameter denoted $\gamma$ poses interesting questions. While
commonly equated to matrix recovery, we here consider the ARM independently. We
investigate the particular structure and global convergence property behind the
asymptotic minimization of the log-det objective function on which
$\mathrm{IRLS}$-$0$ is based. We expand on local convergence theorems, now with
an emphasis on the decline of $\gamma$, and provide representative examples as
well as counterexamples such as a diverging $\mathrm{IRLS}$-$0$ sequence that
clarify theoretical limits. We present a data sparse, alternating realization
$\mathrm{AIRLS}$-$p$ (related to prior work under the name $\mathrm{SALSA}$)
that, along with the rest of this work, serves as basis and introduction to the
more general tensor setting. In conclusion, numerical sensitivity experiments
are carried out that reconfirm the success of $\mathrm{IRLS}$-$0$ and
demonstrate that in surprisingly many cases, a slower decay of $\gamma$ will
yet lead to a solution of the ARM problem, up to the point that the exact
theoretical phase transition for generic recoverability can be observed.
Likewise, this suggests that non-convexity is less substantial and problematic
for the log-det approach than it might initially appear.

likewise has important applications in the analysis of learning dynamics in
games. Regret quantifies the difference between a learner's performance against
a baseline in hindsight. It is well-known that regret-minimizing algorithms
converge to certain classes of equilibria in games; however, traditional forms
of regret used in game theory predominantly consider baselines that permit
deviations to deterministic actions or strategies. In this paper, we revisit
our understanding of regret from the perspective of deviations over partitions
of the full \emph{mixed} strategy space (i.e., probability distributions over
pure strategies), under the lens of the previously-established $\Phi$-regret
framework, which provides a continuum of stronger regret measures. Importantly,
$\Phi$-regret enables learning agents to consider deviations from and to mixed
strategies, generalizing several existing notions of regret such as external,
internal, and swap regret, and thus broadening the insights gained from
regret-based analysis of learning algorithms. We prove here that the
well-studied evolutionary learning algorithm of replicator dynamics (RD)
seamlessly minimizes the strongest possible form of $\Phi$-regret in generic $2
\times 2$ games, without any modification of the underlying algorithm itself.
We subsequently conduct experiments validating our theoretical results in a
suite of 144 $2 \times 2$ games wherein RD exhibits a diverse set of behaviors.
We conclude by providing empirical evidence of $\Phi$-regret minimization by RD
in some larger games, hinting at further opportunity for $\Phi$-regret based
study of such algorithms from both a theoretical and empirical perspective.

for autonomous vehicles, which utilize electromagnetic waves to constantly
sense the environment while simultaneously communicating with neighbouring
devices. An emerging approach to implement DFRC systems is to embed information
in radar waveforms via index modulation (IM). Implementation of DFRC schemes in
vehicular systems gives rise to strict constraints in terms of cost, power
efficiency, and hardware complexity. In this paper, we extend IM-based DFRC
systems to utilize sparse arrays and frequency modulated continuous waveforms
(FMCWs), which are popular in automotive radar for their simplicity and low
hardware complexity. The proposed FMCW-based radar-communications system (FRaC)
operates at reduced cost and complexity by transmitting with a reduced number
of radio frequency modules, combined with narrowband FMCW signalling. This is
achieved via array sparsification in transmission, formulating a virtual
multiple-input multiple-output array by combining the signals in one coherent
processing interval, in which the narrowband waveforms are transmitted in a
randomized manner. Performance analysis and numerical results show that the
proposed radar scheme achieves similar resolution performance compared with a
wideband radar system operating with a large receive aperture, while requiring
less hardware overhead. For the communications subsystem, FRaC achieves higher
rates and improved error rates compared to dual-function signalling based on
conventional phase modulation.

holes closely resemble the Schwarzschild black hole, naked singularities
possess a distinctive feature. A series of bright rings are formed in the
central part of the images with observable radiation $10^3$ times larger than
the rest of the flux making them observationally significant. We elucidate the
physical mechanism, which causes the appearance of the central rings, showing
that the image is determined by the light ring structure of the spacetime. In a
certain region of the parametric space the Gauss-Bonnet naked singularities
possess a stable and an unstable light ring. In addition the gravitational
field becomes repulsive in a certain neighbourhood of the singularity. This
combination of features leads to the formation of the central rings implying
that the effect is not specific for the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity but would

propose a novel human-swarm interaction system, allowing the user to control
swarm position and formation by either direct hand motion or by trajectory
drawing with a hand gesture interface based on the DNN gesture recognition. The
key technology of the SwarmPaint is the user's ability to perform various tasks
with the swarm without additional devices by switching between interaction
modes. Two types of interaction were proposed and developed to adjust a swarm
behavior: free-form trajectory generation control and shaped formation control.
Two preliminary user studies were conducted to explore user's performance and
subjective experience from human-swarm interaction through the developed
control modes. The experimental results revealed a sufficient accuracy in the
trajectory tracing task (mean error of 5.6 cm by gesture draw and 3.1 cm by
mouse draw with the pattern of dimension 1 m by 1 m) over three evaluated
trajectory patterns and up to 7.3 cm accuracy in targeting task with two target
patterns of 1 m achieved by SwarmPaint interface. Moreover, the participants
evaluated the trajectory drawing interface as more intuitive (12.9 %) and
requiring less effort to utilize (22.7%) than direct shape and position control
by gestures, although its physical workload and failure in performance were
presumed as more significant (by 9.1% and 16.3%, respectively).

between images formed by different imaging techniques or under different
conditions, to facilitate heterogeneous data fusion and correlative analysis.
The information-theoretic concept of mutual information (MI) is widely used as
a similarity measure to guide multimodal alignment processes, where most works
have focused on local maximization of MI that typically works well only for
small displacements; this points to a need for global maximization of MI, which
has previously been computationally infeasible due to the high run-time
complexity of existing algorithms. We propose an efficient algorithm for
computing MI for all discrete displacements (formalized as the cross-mutual
information function (CMIF)), which is based on cross-correlation computed in
the frequency domain. We show that the algorithm is equivalent to a direct
method while asymptotically superior in terms of run-time. Furthermore, we
propose a method for multimodal image alignment for transformation models with
few degrees of freedom (e.g. rigid) based on the proposed CMIF-algorithm. We
evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method on three distinct benchmark
datasets, of aerial images, cytological images, and histological images, and we
observe excellent success-rates (in recovering known rigid transformations),
overall outperforming alternative methods, including local optimization of MI
as well as several recent deep learning-based approaches. We also evaluate the
run-times of a GPU implementation of the proposed algorithm and observe
speed-ups from 100 to more than 10,000 times for realistic image sizes compared
to a GPU implementation of a direct method. Code is shared as open-source at

challenge faced is distilling pertinent, recent academic findings and research
into useful guidance. In this article, we aim to tackle this issue by
conducting a state-of-the-art study into organisational cyber security culture
research. This work investigates four questions, including how cyber security
culture is defined, what factors are essential to building and maintaining such
a culture, the frameworks proposed to cultivate a security culture and the
metrics suggested to assess it. Through the application of the PRISMA
systematic literature review technique, we identify and analyse 58 research
articles from the last 10 years (2010-2020). Our findings demonstrate that
while there have been notable changes in the use of terms (e.g., information
security culture and cyber security culture), many of the most influential
factors across papers are similar. Top management support, policy and
procedures, and awareness for instance, are critical in engendering cyber
security culture. Many of the frameworks reviewed revealed common foundations,
with organisational culture playing a substantial role in crafting appropriate
cyber security culture models. Questionnaires and surveys are the most used
tool to measure cyber security culture, but there are also concerns as to
whether more dynamic measures are needed. For practitioners, this article
highlights factors and models essential to the creation and management of a
robust security culture. For research, we produce an up-to-date
characterisation of the field and also define open issues deserving of further
attention such as the role of change management processes and national culture

propose a Bayesian game framework where the defender chooses a classifier with

in the proposed framework is that the set of possible classifiers is
exponential in the set of possible data, which is itself exponential in the
number of features used for classification. To counter this, we first show that
Bayesian Nash equilibria can be characterized completely via functional
threshold classifiers with a small number of parameters. We then show that this
low-dimensional characterization enables to develop a training method to
compute provably approximately optimal classifiers in a scalable manner; and to
develop a learning algorithm for the online setting with low regret (both
independent of the dimension of the set of possible data). We illustrate our

It is cheap and practical to estimate 3D human pose only from monocular video.
However, recent bone splicing based 3D human pose estimation method brings
about the problem of cumulative error. In this paper, the concept of virtual
bones is proposed to solve such a challenge. The virtual bones are imaginary
bones between non-adjacent joints. They do not exist in reality, but they bring
new loop constraints for the estimation of 3D human joints. The proposed
network in this paper predicts real bones and virtual bones, simultaneously.
The final length of real bones is constrained and learned by the loop
constructed by the predicted real bones and virtual bones. Besides, the motion
constraints of joints in consecutive frames are considered. The consistency
between the 2D projected position displacement predicted by the network and the
captured real 2D displacement by the camera is proposed as a new projection
consistency loss for the learning of 3D human pose. The experiments on the
Human3.6M dataset demonstrate the good performance of the proposed method.
Ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed inter-frame
projection consistency constraints and intra-frame loop constraints.

security paradigm, particularly for zero-day attack detection, which is
complementary to existing rule based detection. However, the existing ML based
detection has low detection accuracy and low throughput incurred by inefficient
traffic features extraction. Thus, they cannot detect attacks in realtime
especially in high throughput networks. Particularly, these detection systems
similar to the existing rule based detection can be easily evaded by
sophisticated attacks. To this end, we propose Whisper, a realtime ML based
malicious traffic detection system that achieves both high accuracy and high
throughput by utilizing frequency domain features. It utilizes sequential
features represented by the frequency domain features to achieve bounded
information loss, which ensures high detection accuracy, and meanwhile
constrains the scale of features to achieve high detection throughput.
Particularly, attackers cannot easily interfere with the frequency domain
features and thus Whisper is robust against various evasion attacks. Our
experiments with 42 types of attacks demonstrate that, compared with the
state-of-theart systems, Whisper can accurately detect various sophisticated
and stealthy attacks, achieving at most 18.36% improvement, while achieving two
orders of magnitude throughput. Even under various evasion attacks, Whisper is
still able to maintain around 90% detection accuracy.

that assembly bias in the tidal bias parameter $b_{K^2}$ is measured. We focus
on three standard halo properties: the concentration $c$, spin $\lambda$, and
sphericity $s$, for which we find an assembly bias signal in $b_{K^2}$ that is
opposite to that in $b_1$. Specifically, at fixed mass, halos that get more

$b_{K^2}$. We also investigate the impact of assembly bias on the $b_2(b_1)$

at null infinity, known as the extended BMS (eBMS) algebra is expected to be a
symmetry algebra of the quantum gravity S matrix. However, the algebra of
commutators of the quantized eBMS charges has been a thorny issue in the
literature. On the one hand, recent developments in celestial holography point
towards a symmetry algebra which is a closed Lie algebra with no central
extension or anomaly, and on the other hand, work of Distler, Flauger and Horn
has shown that when these charges are quantized at null infinity, the
commutator of a supertranslation and a superrotation charge does not close into
a supertranslation but gets deformed by a 2 cocycle term, which is consistent
with the original proposal of Barnich and Troessaert.
  In this paper, we revisit this issue in light of recent developments in the
classical understanding of superrotation charges. We show that, for extended
BMS symmetries, a phase space at null infinity is an extension of hitherto
considered phase spaces which also includes a mode associated to the spin
memory and its conjugate partner. We also show that for holomorphic vector
fields on the celestial plane, quantization of the eBMS charges in the new
phase space leads to an algebra which closes without a 2 cocycle. The
degenerate vacua are labelled by the soft news and a Schwarzian mode which
corresponds to deformations of the celestial metric by superrotations. The
closed eBMS quantum algebra may also lead to a convergence between two
manifestations of asymptotic symmetries, one via asymptotic quantization at
null infinity and the other through celestial holography.

people have died due to this disease, whereas there have been more than 180
million confirmed cases of COVID-19. The collapse of the health system in many
countries has demonstrated the need of developing tools to automatize the
diagnosis of the disease from medical imaging. Previous studies have used deep
learning for this purpose. However, the performance of this alternative highly
depends on the size of the dataset employed for training the algorithm. In this
work, we propose a classification framework based on sparse coding in order to
identify the pneumonia patterns associated with different pathologies.
Specifically, each chest X-ray (CXR) image is partitioned into different tiles.
The most relevant features extracted from PCA are then used to build the
dictionary within the sparse coding procedure. Once images are transformed and
reconstructed from the elements of the dictionary, classification is performed
from the reconstruction errors of individual patches associated with each
image. Performance is evaluated in a real scenario where simultaneously
differentiation between four different pathologies: control vs bacterial
pneumonia vs viral pneumonia vs COVID-19. The accuracy when identifying the
presence of pneumonia is 93.85%, whereas 88.11% is obtained in the 4-class
classification context. The excellent results and the pioneering use of sparse
coding in this scenario evidence the applicability of this approach as an aid

view is performed locally on a dedicated embedded inference processor. Only the
semantic skeleton representation is transmitted over the network and raw images
remain on the sensor board. 3D poses are recovered from 2D joints on a central
backend, based on triangulation and a body model which incorporates prior
knowledge of the human skeleton. A feedback channel from backend to individual
sensors is implemented on a semantic level. The allocentric 3D pose is
backprojected into the sensor views where it is fused with 2D joint detections.
The local semantic model on each sensor can thus be improved by incorporating
global context information. The whole pipeline is capable of real-time
operation. We evaluate our method on three public datasets, where we achieve
state-of-the-art results and show the benefits of our feedback architecture, as

(AdS$_2$), dilatonic black hole coupled with conformal matter, and derive the
Page curve for the entanglement entropy of radiation. We first work in a
semiclassical approximation with backreaction. We show that the end-point of
the evaporation process is AdS$_2$ with a vanishing dilaton, i.e. a regular,
singularity-free, zero-entropy state. We explicitly compute the entanglement
entropies of the black hole and the radiation, as functions of the horizon
radius, using the conformal field theory (CFT) dual to AdS$_2$ gravity. We use
a simplified toy model, in which evaporation is described by the forming and
growing of a negative mass configuration in the positive-mass black hole
interior. This is similar to the ``islands'' proposal, recently put forward to
explain the Page curve for evaporating black holes. The resulting Page curve
for AdS$_2$ black holes is in agreement with unitary evolution. The
entanglement entropy of the radiation initially grows, closely following a
thermal behavior, reaches a maximum at half-way of the evaporation process, and
then goes down to zero, following the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the black
hole. Consistency of our simplified model requires a non-trivial identification
of the central charge of the CFT describing AdS$_2$ gravity with the number of
species of fields describing Hawking radiation.

from dedicated sensors with no unified full-body approach. We investigate a
general, real-time, full-body pose estimation framework based on two RGB+D
camera streams with non-overlapping views mounted on a smart walker equipment
used in rehabilitation. Human keypoint estimation is performed using a
two-stage neural network framework. The 2D-Stage implements a detection module
that locates body keypoints in the 2D image frames. The 3D-Stage implements a
regression module that lifts and relates the detected keypoints in both cameras
to the 3D space relative to the walker. Model predictions are low-pass filtered
to improve temporal consistency. A custom acquisition method was used to obtain
a dataset, with 14 healthy subjects, used for training and evaluating the
proposed framework offline, which was then deployed on the real walker
equipment. An overall keypoint detection error of 3.73 pixels for the 2D-Stage

representation in real-time and from inexpensive sensors, serving as a common
base for downstream metrics extraction solutions, and Human-Robot interaction
applications. Despite promising results, more data should be collected on users
with impairments, to assess its performance as a rehabilitation tool in

key properties. Namely, the ICI can be computed as a function of the state, and
when this function is used as the control policy, the ICI is rendered
stationary and the system will eventually come to a stop. This characterization
induces an analytical region of capturable states for the VHIP, which can be
used to conceptually guide where to step. To further address state and control
constraints during recovery, we present and theoretically analyze an explicit
ICI-based controller with online optimal feedback gains. Simulations
demonstrate the validity of our controller for capturability maintenance

intuitive, such a native label assignment strategy cannot reveal the underlying

impairs performance, since some negatives are semantically similar to the query

prove that for contrastive learning, inaccurate label assignment heavily
impairs its generalization for semantic instance discrimination, while accurate
labels benefit its generalization. Inspired by this theory, we propose a novel
self-labeling refinement approach for contrastive learning. It improves the
label quality via two complementary modules: (i) self-labeling refinery (SLR)
to generate accurate labels and (ii) momentum mixup (MM) to enhance similarity
between query and its positive. SLR uses a positive of a query to estimate
semantic similarity between a query and its positive and negatives, and
combines estimated similarity with vanilla label assignment in contrastive
learning to iteratively generate more accurate and informative soft labels. We
theoretically show that our SLR can exactly recover the true semantic labels of
label-corrupted data, and supervises networks to achieve zero prediction error
on classification tasks. MM randomly combines queries and positives to increase
semantic similarity between the generated virtual queries and their positives
so as to improves label accuracy. Experimental results on CIFAR10, ImageNet,

characterisations were established for sparsifiability of graphs with other
2-variable predicates on Boolean domains by Filtser and Krauthgamer [SIDMA'17]

  Bansal, Svensson and Trevisan [FOCS'19] introduced a weaker notion of
sparsification termed ""additive sparsification"", which does not require weights
on the edges of the graph. In particular, Bansal et al. designed algorithms for
additive sparsifiers for cuts in graphs and hypergraphs.
  As our main result, we establish that all Boolean Constraint Satisfaction
Problems (CSPs) admit an additive sparsifier; that is, for every Boolean
predicate $P:\{0,1\}^k\to\{0,1\}$ of a fixed arity $k$, we show that CSP($P$)
admits an additive sparsifier. Under our newly introduced notion of all-but-one
sparsification for non-Boolean predicates, we show that CSP($P$) admits an
additive sparsifier for any predicate $P:D^k\to\{0,1\}$ of a fixed arity $k$ on
an arbitrary finite domain $D$.

such as DeFi and NFT trading. However, training / running large-scale DNNs as
part of a smart contract is infeasible on today's blockchain platforms, due to
two fundamental design issues of these platforms. First, blockchains nowadays
typically require that each node maintain the complete world state at any time,
meaning that the node must execute all transactions in every block. This is
prohibitively expensive for computationally intensive smart contracts involving
DNNs. Second, existing blockchain platforms expect smart contract transactions
to have deterministic, reproducible results and effects. In contrast, DNNs are
usually trained / run lock-free on massively parallel computing devices such as
GPUs, TPUs and / or computing clusters, which often do not yield deterministic
results.
  This paper proposes novel platform designs, collectively called A New Hope
(ANH), that address the above issues. The main ideas are (i)
computing-intensive smart contract transactions are only executed by nodes who
need their results, or by specialized serviced providers, and (ii) a
non-deterministic smart contract transaction leads to uncertain results, which
can still be validated, though at a relatively high cost; specifically for
DNNs, the validation cost can often be reduced by verifying properties of the
results instead of their exact values. In addition, we discuss various
implications of ANH, including its effects on token fungibility, sharding,
private transactions, and the fundamental meaning of a smart contract.

out the possibility that such theories might reconcile at least one
understanding of locality and realism to quantum mechanical predictions.
Violation might reflect, at least partly, failure to acknowledge the
contextuality of quantum mechanics, or that data from different probability

calculation for both SM and New Physics effects of the Higgs pair production to
next-to-leading-order (NLO), including loop-induced processes $gg\to HH$,
$gg\to HHg$, and $qg \to qHH$. We also included the calculation of the
corrections from diagrams with only one QCD coupling in $qg \to qHH$, which was

couplings for the LHC at center-of-mass energies of 14 TeV and a provisional

obtain results better than using total cross-section alone, we focused on the
$b \bar{b} \gamma \gamma$ channel and divided the differential cross-section
into low and high bins based on the total invariant mass and $p_{T}$ spectra.
The new physics effects are further constrained by including extra kinematic
information. However, some degeneracy persists, as shown in previous studies,
especially in determining the Higgs trilinear coupling. Our analysis shows that
the degeneracy is reduced by including the full NLO corrections.

nondegenerate ground states and gapped phases with $\Delta(\alpha) > 0$ and
doubly degenerate ground states. Exact thermodynamics is limited to $\alpha =
0$, the linear Heisenberg antiferromagnet (HAF). Exact diagonalization of small
systems at frustration $\alpha$ followed by density matrix renormalization
group (DMRG) calculations returns the entropy density $S(T,\alpha,N)$ and
magnetic susceptibility $\chi(T,\alpha,N)$ of progressively larger systems up

$S(T,\alpha)$ or $\chi(T,\alpha)$, is demonstrated down to $T/J \sim 0.01$ in

$T^*(\alpha)$ is obtained directly in chains with large $\Delta(\alpha)$ and by
extrapolation for small gaps. A phenomenological approximation for
$S(T,\alpha)$ down to $T = 0$ indicates power-law deviations
$T^{-\gamma(\alpha)}$ from $\exp(-\Delta(\alpha)/T)$ with exponent
$\gamma(\alpha)$ that increases with $\alpha$. The $\chi(T,\alpha)$ analysis
also yields power-law deviations, but with exponent $\eta(\alpha)$ that
decreases with $\alpha$. $S(T,\alpha)$ and the spin density $\rho(T,\alpha) =
4T\chi(T,\alpha)$ probe the thermal and magnetic fluctuations, respectively, of
strongly correlated spin states. Gapless chains have constant
$S(T,\alpha)/\rho(T,\alpha)$ for $T < 0.10$. Remarkably, the ratio decreases

ResNet, have become increasingly accurate, these networks are computationally
expensive involving billions of arithmetic operations and parameters. To
improve the classification accuracy, state-of-the-art CNNs usually involve
large and complex convolutional layers. However, for certain applications, e.g.
Internet of Things (IoT), where such CNNs are to be implemented on
resource-constrained platforms, the CNN architectures have to be small and
efficient. To deal with this problem, reducing the resource consumption in
convolutional layers has become one of the most significant solutions. In this
work, a multi-objective optimisation approach is proposed to trade-off between
the amount of computation and network accuracy by using Multi-Objective
Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs). The number of convolution kernels and the size
of these kernels are proportional to computational resource consumption of
CNNs. Therefore, this paper considers optimising the computational resource
consumption by reducing the size and number of kernels in convolutional layers.
Additionally, the use of unconventional kernel shapes has been investigated and
results show these clearly outperform the commonly used square convolution
kernels. The main contributions of this paper are therefore a methodology to
significantly reduce computational cost of CNNs, based on unconventional kernel
shapes, and provide different trade-offs for specific use cases. The
experimental results further demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
large improvements in resource consumption with no significant reduction in
network performance. Compared with the benchmark CNN, the best trade-off
architecture shows a reduction in multiplications of up to 6X and with slight
increase in classification accuracy on CIFAR-10 dataset.

warm inflation scenario is also supported by the estimation of the effect of
the magnetic field on the heavy particles decay width.

exploiting the sparsity and the correlation of multiuser cascaded channels in
millimeter-wave massive MISO systems. Based on the fact that the phsical
positions of the BS, the RIS and users may not change in several or even tens
of consecutive channel coherence blocks, we first estimate the full channel
state information (CSI) including all the angle and gain information in the
first coherence block, and then only re-estimate the channel gains in the
remaining coherence blocks with much less pilot overhead. In the first
coherence block, we propose a two-phase channel estimation method, in which the
cascaded channel of one typical user is estimated in Phase I based on the
linear correlation among cascaded paths, while the cascaded channels of other
users are estimated in Phase II by utilizing the partial CSI of the common base
station (BS)-RIS channel obtained in Phase I. The total theoretical minimum
pilot overhead in the first coherence block is $8J-2+(K-1)\left\lceil

the low corona, known as stealth CMEs, are problematic as upon arrival at Earth
they can lead to geomagnetic disturbances that were not predicted by space
weather forecasters. We investigate the origin and eruption of a stealth event
that occurred on 2015 January 3 that was responsible for a strong geomagnetic
storm upon its arrival at Earth. To simulate the coronal magnetic field and
plasma parameters of the eruption we use a coupled approach. This approach
combines an evolutionary nonlinear force-free field model of the global corona
with a MHD simulation. The combined simulation approach accurately reproduces
the stealth event and suggests that sympathetic eruptions occur. In the
combined simulation we found that three flux ropes form and then erupt. The
first two flux ropes, which are connected to a large AR complex behind the east
limb, erupt first producing two near-simultaneous CMEs. These CMEs are closely
followed by a third, weaker flux rope eruption in the simulation that
originated between the periphery of AR 12252 and the southern polar coronal
hole. The third eruption coincides with a faint coronal dimming, which appears
in the SDO/AIA 211 A observations, that is attributed as the source responsible
for the stealth event and later the geomagnetic disturbance at 1 AU. The
incorrect interpretation of the stealth event being linked to the occurrence of
a single partial halo CME observed by LASCO/C2 is mainly due to the lack of
STEREO observations being available at the time of the CMEs. The simulation
also shows that the LASCO CME is not a single event but rather two
near-simultaneous CMEs. These results show the significance of the coupled
data-driven simulation approach in interpreting the eruption and that an
operational L5 mission is crucial for space weather forecasting.

optoelectronic neuromorphic platforms that leverage the complementary
properties of optics and electronics. Starting from the conjecture that future
large-scale neuromorphic systems will utilize integrated photonics and fiber
optics for communication in conjunction with analog electronics for
computation, we consider two possible paths towards achieving this vision. The
first is a semiconductor platform based on analog CMOS circuits and
waveguide-integrated photodiodes. The second is a superconducting approach that
utilizes Josephson junctions and waveguide-integrated superconducting
single-photon detectors. We discuss available devices, assess scaling
potential, and provide a list of key metrics and demonstrations for each
platform. Both platforms hold potential, but their development will diverge in
important respects. Semiconductor systems benefit from a robust fabrication
ecosystem and can build on extensive progress made in purely electronic
neuromorphic computing but will require III-V light source integration with
electronics at an unprecedented scale, further advances in ultra-low
capacitance photodiodes, and success from emerging memory technologies.
Superconducting systems place near theoretically minimum burdens on light
sources (a tremendous boon to one of the most speculative aspects of either
platform) and provide new opportunities for integrated, high-endurance synaptic
memory. However, superconducting optoelectronic systems will also contend with
interfacing low-voltage electronic circuits to semiconductor light sources, the
serial biasing of superconducting devices on an unprecedented scale, a less
mature fabrication ecosystem, and cryogenic infrastructure.

performance of models used in the classification and recognition of

mining from a single perspective, with the features mined being limited and the
internal relationships between them being ignored. Consequently, useful
features are lost and classification results are unsatisfactory. To fully mine
and utilize image features, a new multi-scale feature-mining learning algorithm
(MGRNet) is proposed. The model uses principal component analysis to reduce the
dimensionality of the original hyperspectral image (HSI) to retain 99.99% of
its semantic information and extract dimensionality reduction features. Using a
multi-scale convolution algorithm, the input dimensionality reduction features
were mined to obtain shallow features, which then served as inputs into a
multi-scale graph convolution algorithm to construct the internal relationships
between eigenvalues at different scales. We then carried out cross fusion of
multi-scale information obtained by graph convolution, before inputting the new
information obtained into the residual network algorithm for deep feature
mining. Finally, a flexible maximum transfer function classifier was used to
predict the final features and complete the classification. Experiments on
three common hyperspectral datasets showed the MGRNet algorithm proposed in
this paper to be superior to traditional methods in recognition accuracy.

  Despite these theoretical advantages, to date no practical PC-tree

Hsu and McConnell in some places only sketching the details of the
implementation. In this paper, we describe two alternative implementations of
PC-trees. For the first one, we follow the approach by Hsu and McConnell,
filling in the necessary details and also proposing improvements on the

efficiently representing the tree using a Union-Find data structure. In an

prove that the averaged problem is a suitable approximation of the restricted

non-parametrically recovers as the arm's idle time increases. With the
objective of maximizing the expected cumulative reward over $T$ time periods,
we design a class of ``Purely Periodic Policies'' that jointly set a period to

is asymptotically optimal when $K$ grows to infinity. For the online problem

Despite such a dramatic change, predictions of LE models remain unverified by
measurements of the fully developed jet. We compared predictions of momentum

first demonstrate FIGA in the feature space and then in the problem space. FIGA
assumes no prior knowledge of the defending model's learning algorithm and does
not require any gradient information. FIGA assumes knowledge of the feature
representation and the mean feature values of defending model's dataset. FIGA
leverages feature importance rankings by perturbing the most important features
of the input in the direction of the target class. While FIGA is conceptually
similar to other work which uses feature selection processes (e.g., mimicry
attacks), we formalize an attack algorithm with three tunable parameters and
investigate the strength of FIGA on tabular datasets. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of FIGA by evading phishing detection models trained on four
different tabular phishing datasets and one financial dataset with an average
success rate of 94%. We extend FIGA to the phishing problem space by limiting
the possible perturbations to be valid and feasible in the phishing domain. We
generate valid adversarial phishing sites that are visually identical to their
unperturbed counterpart and use them to attack six tabular ML models achieving
a 13.05% average success rate.

simulation of particle suspensions. When those particles are anisotropic, the
addition of a particle orientation vector to the kinetic description yields a
$2d-1$ dimensional theory which becomes intractable to simulate, especially in
three dimensions or near states where the particles are highly aligned.
Coarse-grained theories that track only moments of the particle distribution
functions provide a more efficient simulation framework, but require closure
assumptions. For the particular case where the particles are apolar, the
Bingham closure has been found to agree well with the underlying kinetic
theory; yet the closure is non-trivial to compute, requiring the solution of an
often nearly-singular nonlinear equation at every spatial discretization point
at every timestep. In this paper, we present a robust, accurate, and efficient
numerical scheme for evaluating the Bingham closure, with a controllable
error/efficiency tradeoff. To demonstrate the utility of the method, we carry
out high-resolution simulations of a coarse-grained continuum model for a
suspension of active particles in parameter regimes inaccessible to kinetic
theories. Analysis of these simulations reveals that inaccurately computing the
closure can act to effectively limit spatial resolution in the coarse-grained
fields. Pushing these simulations to the high spatial resolutions enabled by
our method reveals a coupling between vorticity and topological defects in the
suspension director field, as well as signatures of energy transfer between
scales in this active fluid model.

in such a way that his (continuously-rebalanced) LETF portfolio can match the
gearing ratio of a given, professionally managed product and, at the same time,
enjoy lower weighted-average expenses than the existing LETF. Given a finite
set of LETFs that exist in the marketplace, I give necessary and sufficient
conditions for these products to be undominated in the price-gearing plane. In
a beautiful application of the duality theorem of linear programming, I prove a
kind of two-fund theorem for LETFs: given a target gearing ratio for the
investor, the cheapest way to achieve it is to combine (uniquely) the two
nearest undominated LETF products that bracket it on the leverage axis. This
also happens to be the implementation that has the lowest annual turnover. For
the writer's enjoyment, we supply a second proof of the Main Theorem on LETFs

one after another, the degrees of freedom of a globally coupled Ising spin
system while letting it thermalize through a heat bath. It has previously been
shown that during PQ, the mean equilibrium spin value follows a martingale
process and this process can characterize the memory of the system. In the
present study, we find that the aforementioned martingale implies a local
invariance of the path weight for the total quenched magnetization, the
Markovian process whose increment is the spin that is fixed last. Consequently,
PQ lets the probability distribution for the total quenched magnetization
evolve while keeping the Boltzmann-like factor, or a canonical structure, under
constraint, which consists of a path-independent potential and a path-counting
entropy. Moreover, when the PQ starts from full equilibrium, the probability
distribution at each stage of PQ is found to be the limit distribution of what
we call recycled quenching, the process in which a randomly chosen quenched
spin is unquenched after a single step of PQ. The local invariance is a
consequence of the martingale property, and not an application of known
theorems for the martingale process.

samplesizes (i.e. are large-$p$-small-$n$). Moreover, dependencies of various
orders co-exist in the datasets. In the Undirected probabilistic Graphical
Model (UGM) framework the Glasso algorithm has been proposed to deal with high
dimensional micro-array datasets forcing sparsity. Also, modifications of the
default Glasso algorithm are developed to overcome the problem of complex
interaction structure. In this work we advocate the use of a simple score-based
Hill Climbing algorithm (HC) that learns Gaussian Bayesian Networks (BNs)
leaning on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). We compare HC with Glasso and its
modifications in the UGM framework on their capability to reconstruct GRNs from
micro-array data belonging to the Escherichia Coli genome. We benefit from the
analytical properties of the Joint Probability Density (JPD) function on which
both directed and undirected PGMs build to convert DAGs to UGMs.
  We conclude that dependencies in complex data are learned best by the HC
algorithm, presenting them most accurately and efficiently, simultaneously
modelling strong local and weaker but significant global connections coexisting
in the gene expression dataset. The HC algorithm adapts intrinsically to the
complex dependency structure of the dataset, without forcing a specific
structure in advance. On the contrary, Glasso and modifications model
unnecessary dependencies at the expense of the probabilistic information in the
network and of a structural bias in the JPD function that can only be relieved
including many parameters.

benefits of state-of-the-art acquisition functions to achieve a delicate
tradeoff between exploration and exploitation for the unconstrained

algorithm for the constrained optimization problem. By dividing the
optimization procedure into two stages and first focusing on finding an initial
feasible point, we manage to gain more information about the valid region and
can better avoid sampling around the infeasible area. After achieving the first
feasible point, we favor the feasible region by adopting a specially designed
penalization term to the acquisition function ensemble. The experimental
results quantitatively demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can reduce the
overall simulation time by up to 74 times compared to differential evolution

equation of state parameter, and the corresponding energy leads to an energy
density that mimics the cosmological constant. In this paper we expand the
fractional dark energy model considering a non-zero chemical potential and we
show that it may thermodynamically describe a phantom regime. The Planck
constraints on the equation of state parameter put upper limits on the allowed
value of the ratio of the chemical potential to the temperature. In the second
part, we investigate the system of fractional dark energy particles with
negative absolute temperatures (NAT). NAT are possible in quantum systems and
in cosmology, if there exists an upper bound on the energy. This maximum energy
is one ingredient of the FDE model and indicates a connection between FDE and

Intelligence (AI) errors. These corrections should be quick and non-iterative.
To solve this problem without modification of a legacy AI system, we propose
special `external' devices, correctors. Elementary correctors consist of two
parts, a classifier that separates the situations with high risk of error from
the situations in which the legacy AI system works well and a new decision for
situations with potential errors. Input signals for the correctors can be the
inputs of the legacy AI system, its internal signals, and outputs. If the
intrinsic dimensionality of data is high enough then the classifiers for
correction of small number of errors can be very simple. According to the
blessing of dimensionality effects, even simple and robust Fisher's
discriminants can be used for one-shot learning of AI correctors. Stochastic
separation theorems provide the mathematical basis for this one-short learning.
However, as the number of correctors needed grows, the cluster structure of
data becomes important and a new family of stochastic separation theorems is

Robust Adversarial Immune-inspired Learning System (RAILS). Initializing a
population of exemplars that is balanced across classes, RAILS starts from a
uniform label distribution that encourages diversity and uses an evolutionary
optimization process to adaptively adjust the predictive label distribution in
a manner that emulates the way the natural immune system recognizes novel
pathogens. RAILS' evolutionary optimization process explicitly captures the
tradeoff between robustness (diversity) and accuracy (specificity) of the
network, and represents a new immune-inspired perspective on adversarial
learning. The benefits of RAILS are empirically demonstrated under eight types
of adversarial attacks on a DNN adversarial image classifier for several
benchmark datasets, including: MNIST; SVHN; CIFAR-10; and CIFAR-10. We find
that PGD is the most damaging attack strategy and that for this attack RAILS is
significantly more robust than other methods, achieving improvements in

Pre-training tasks for Academic performance prediction. DPA pre-trains two
models, a generator and a discriminator, and fine-tunes the discriminator on

interactions where some tokens are masked is provided to the generator which is
trained to reconstruct the original sequence. Then, the discriminator takes an
interaction sequence where the masked tokens are replaced by the generator's
outputs, and is trained to predict the originalities of all tokens in the

local apiculture. One of the most effective way to combat the harmful species
is to locate and destroy their nests. By mobilizing the public to actively
report possible sightings of the Asian giant hornet, the governmentcould timely
send inspectors to confirm and possibly destroy the nests. However, such
confirmation requires lab expertise, where manually checking the reports one by
one is extremely consuming of human resources. Further given the limited
knowledge of the public about the Asian giant hornet and the randomness of
report submission, only few of the numerous reports proved positive, i.e.
existing nests. How to classify or prioritize the reports efficiently and
automatically, so as to determine the dispatch of personnel, is of great

propose a method to predict the priority of sighting reports based on machine
learning. We model the problem of optimal prioritization of sighting reports as
a problem of classification and prediction. We extracted a variety of rich

Based on these characteristics, we propose a classification model based on
logistic regression to predict the credibility of a certain report.
Furthermore, our model quantifies the impact between reports to get the
priority ranking of the reports. Extensive experiments on the public dataset

enable narrow-beam communications. This paper proposes a learning and
adaptation framework in which the dynamics of the communication beams are
learned and then exploited to design adaptive beam-tracking and training with
low overhead: on a long-timescale, a deep recurrent variational autoencoder
(DR-VAE) uses noisy beam-training feedback to learn a probabilistic model of
beam dynamics and enable predictive beam-tracking; on a short-timescale, an
adaptive beam-training procedure is formulated as a partially observable (PO-)
Markov decision process (MDP) and optimized via point-based value iteration
(PBVI) by leveraging beam-training feedback and a probabilistic prediction of
the strongest beam pair provided by the DR-VAE. In turn, beam-training feedback
is used to refine the DR-VAE via stochastic gradient ascent in a continuous
process of learning and adaptation. The proposed DR-VAE learning framework
learns accurate beam dynamics: it reduces the Kullback-Leibler divergence
between the ground truth and the learned model of beam dynamics by 95% over the
Baum-Welch algorithm and a naive learning approach that neglects feedback
errors. Numerical results on a line-of-sight (LOS) scenario with multipath
reveal that the proposed dual timescale approach yields near-optimal spectral
efficiency, and improves it by 130% over a policy that scans exhaustively over
the dominant beam pairs, and by 20% over a state-of-the-art POMDP policy.
Finally, a low-complexity policy is proposed by reducing the POMDP to an
error-robust MDP, and is shown to perform well in regimes with infrequent
feedback errors.

fluid models. If a variable is defined on a high-resolution grid it may be
coarse-grained so that it is defined on a grid of lower resolution. In general
this will cause some information about the variable to be lost. In particular,
horizontal divergences, gradients or other operators calculated on the coarse
grid after projecting may differ from those calculated on the fine grid. In
some cases we are able to choose averaging weights for coarse-graining such
that the coarse-grid operators will give a result approximating that of the
corresponding fine-grid operators applied on the fine grid. In this work we
derive general conditions on the averaging weights that allow the divergence
and gradient to be preserved. These conditions are applied to a regular
triangular mesh with B-grid variable placement in which the fine-grid
resolution is some integer multiple $N$ of the coarse-grid resolution. For this
case we find particular values for the averaging weights that preserve the
divergence, and a set of different averaging weights that preserve the
gradient. We observe that the vertical component of the curl is also preserved
by the same coarse-graining that preserves divergence. These coarse-grainings
are applied to data from FESOM2 simulations and we demonstrate that using the
particular coarse-grainings derived herein gives an overall reduction in $L^1$

smart and reconfigurable photonic networks. Much efforts have been made to
improve the metallic microheater performance in the past decades. However,
because of the metallic nature of light absorption, placing the metallic
microheater very close to the waveguide for fast response is impractical and
has not been done experimentally. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a
metallic microheater placed very close to the waveguide based on parity-time
(PT) symmetry breaking. The intrinsic high loss of metallic heater ensures the
system will operate in the PT-symmetry-broken region, which guarantee the low
loss of light in the silicon waveguide. Moreover, heating at a close range
significantly reduces the response time. A fast response time of ~1 us is
achieved without introducing extra loss. The insertion loss is only 0.1 dB for
the long heater. The modulation bandwidth is 280 kHz, which is an order of
magnitude improvement when compared with that of the mainstream thermo-optic
phase shifters. To verify the capability of large-scale integration, a 1*8
phased array for beam steering is also demonstrated experimentally with the
PT-symmetry-broken metallic heaters. Our work provides a novel design concept
for low-loss fast-response optical switches with dissipative materials and
offers a new approach to enhance the performance of thermo-optic phase
shifters.

  Inhomogeneous Electromagnetic Surfaces with Connected Conductors",,,"10.1109/TAP.2022.3145482",,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a generalized macromodeling approach is presented to simulate
complex electromagnetic (EM) surfaces consisting of unit cells with connected
conductors. Macromodels of each unit cell are produced by applying the
equivalence principle on fictitious surfaces encapsulating them. Unit cells
often consist of multiple dielectric layers and conductor traces, featuring
multiscale structures. Challenges arise when a current-carrying conductor trace
traverses the fictitious surface. Hence, a new method based on half
Rao-Wilton-Glisson basis functions is proposed to accurately ensure the
continuity of the surface currents and avoid singularities at the
intersections. The accuracy of the proposed approach is validated by comparing
the results with commercial solvers for different EM surfaces.
