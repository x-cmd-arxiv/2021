Large Program (LP) that is identifying and performing a first characterization
of many of the most luminous star-forming galaxies known in the z>6.5 universe.
REBELS is providing this probe by systematically scanning 40 of the brightest
UV-selected galaxies identified over a 7-deg**2 area for bright 158-micron
[CII] and 88-micron [OIII] lines and dust-continuum emission. Selection of the
40 REBELS targets was done by combining our own and other photometric
selections, each of which is subject to extensive vetting using three
completely independent sets of photometry and template-fitting codes. Building
on the observational strategy deployed in two pilot programs, we are increasing
the number of massive interstellar medium (ISM) reservoirs known at z>6.5 by
~4-5x to >30. In this manuscript, we motivate the observational strategy
deployed in the REBELS program and present initial results. Based on the 60.6
hours of ALMA observations taken in the first year of the program (November
2019 to January 2020), 18 highly significant >~7sigma [CII] lines have already
been discovered, the bulk of which (13/18) also show >~3.3 sigma dust-continuum
emission. These newly discovered lines more than triple the number of bright
ISM-cooling lines known in the z>6.5 universe, such that the number of
ALMA-derived redshifts at z>6.5 already rival Lya redshift discoveries. An
analysis of the completeness of our search results vs. star formation rate
(SFR) suggests an ~79% efficiency in scanning for [CII] when the SFR(UV+IR) is
in excess of 28 M_sol/yr. These new LP results further demonstrate ALMA's
efficiency as a ""redshift machine"", particularly in the epoch of reionization.

fields are envisaged to become more and more accurate, which calls for
theoretical computations of rates and probabilities with correspondingly higher
precision. In strong-field QED this requires the knowledge of radiative
corrections to be added to leading-order results. Here, we first derive the
mass operator in momentum space of an off-shell electron in the presence of an
arbitrary plane wave. By taking the average of the mass operator in momentum
space over an on-shell electron state, we obtain a new representation,
equivalent to but more compact than the known one computed in [Sov. Phys. JETP
\textbf{42}, 400 (1975)]. Moreover, we use the obtained mass operator to
determine the electron mass shift in an arbitrary plane wave, which generalizes
the already known expression in a constant crossed field. The spin-dependent
part of the electron mass shift can be related to the anomalous magnetic moment
of the electron in the plane wave. We show that within the locally constant
field approximation it is possible to conveniently define a local expression of
the electron anomalous magnetic moment, which reduces to the known expression
in a constant crossed field. Beyond the locally constant field approximation,
however, the interaction between the electron and the plane wave is non-local
such that it is not possible to conveniently introduce an electron anomalous
magnetic moment.

construct these quadratic cuts, we solve a separation problem involving a
linear matrix inequality with a special structure that allows the use of

convex feasible set when intersected with the equality constraints. We show
that our relaxations are an outer-approximation of a semi-infinite convex

practice, especially in clinical practice. We consider the problem of learning
representations independent to multiple biases. In literature, this is mostly
solved by purging the bias information from learned representations. We however
expect this strategy to harm the diversity of information in the
representation, and thus limiting its prospective usage (e.g., interpretation).
Therefore, we propose to mitigate the bias while keeping almost all information
in the latent representations, which enables us to observe and interpret them
as well. To achieve this, we project latent features onto a learned vector
direction, and enforce the independence between biases and projected features
rather than all learned features. To interpret the mapping between projected
features and input data, we propose projection-wise disentangling: a sampling
and reconstruction along the learned vector direction. The proposed method was
evaluated on the analysis of 3D facial shape and patient characteristics
(N=5011). Experiments showed that this conceptually simple method achieved
state-of-the-art fair prediction performance and interpretability, showing its
great potential for clinical applications.

topologies. A known design approach uses full-wave electromagnetic simulations
to determine the coupling coefficient between resonators as a function of their
relative position. This could be done using time-domain simulations using a
fast Fourier transform (FFT) to extract the couplings from the S parameters
obtained from time-domain signals. However, this approach has a poor
performance in terms of resolution and specially for weak couplings, leading to
unreasonably long simulation times. To overcome this, we introduce a technique
to obtain the couplings directly from time signals, without moving to the
frequency domain. This procedure works for strong and weak couplings, with much
shorter simulation times and a reduced simulation domain over the FFT approach.
This technique is used to design coupled resonator filter efficiently from time
domain simulations. We implement this procedure using the finite-difference
time-domain framework using an open source solver and discuss our
implementation. We show that its results are very similar to previously
published ones obtained from frequency domain simulations, even in the case of
very weak couplings. Finally, we design and measure a filter to show the good
performance of the proposed approach.

behavior both for academic researchers and industry practitioners. For game
designers and game user researchers, it is important to gauge the distance
between intended strategies and emergent strategies; this comparison allows
identification of glitches or undesirable behaviors. For academic researchers
using games for serious purposes such as education, the strategies adopted by
players are indicative of their cognitive progress in relation to serious
goals, such as learning process. Current techniques and systems created to
address these needs present a few drawbacks. Qualitative methods are difficult
to scale upwards to include large number of players and are prone to subjective
biases. Other approaches such as visualization and analytical tools are either
designed to provide an aggregated overview of the data, losing the nuances of
individual player behaviors, or, in the attempt of accounting for individual
behavior, are not specifically designed to reduce the visual cognitive load. In
this work, we propose a novel visualization technique that specifically
addresses the tasks of comparing behavior sequences in order to capture an
overview of the strategies enacted by players and at the same time examine
individual player behaviors to identify differences and outliers. This approach
allows users to form hypotheses about player strategies and verify them. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique through a case study: utilizing
a prototype system to investigate data collected from a commercial educational

results show that core features of the system proved useful to our potential

Given a new dataset and a well-defined machine learning task, humans begin by
reading a description of the dataset and documentation for the algorithms to be
used. This work is the first to use these textual descriptions, which we call
privileged information, for AutoML. We use a pre-trained Transformer model to
process the privileged text and demonstrate that using this information
improves AutoML performance. Thus, our approach leverages the progress of
unsupervised representation learning in natural language processing to provide
a significant boost to AutoML. We demonstrate that using only textual
descriptions of the data and functions achieves reasonable classification
performance, and adding textual descriptions to data meta-features improves
classification across tabular datasets. To achieve zero-shot AutoML we train a
graph neural network with these description embeddings and the data
meta-features. Each node represents a training dataset, which we use to predict
the best machine learning pipeline for a new test dataset in a zero-shot

but state-of-the-art devices suffer from noise originating from the hyperfine
interactions with nuclear defects. We show that these interactions have a
highly tunable anisotropy that is controlled by device design and external
electric fields. This tunability enables sweet spots where the hyperfine noise
is suppressed by an order of magnitude and is comparable to isotopically
purified materials. We identify surprisingly simple designs where the qubits
are highly coherent and are largely unaffected by both charge and hyperfine
noise. We find that the large spin-orbit interaction typical of elongated
quantum dots not only speeds up qubit operations, but also dramatically
renormalizes the hyperfine noise, altering qualitatively the dynamics of driven
qubits and enhancing the fidelity of qubit gates. Our findings serve as
guidelines to design high performance qubits for scaling up quantum computers.

mechanism for incorporating inductive biases into VAEs, and introduce a simple
and effective alternative approach: Intermediary Latent Space VAEs(InteL-VAEs).
InteL-VAEs use an intermediary set of latent variables to control the
stochasticity of the encoding process, before mapping these in turn to the
latent representation using a parametric function that encapsulates our desired
inductive bias(es). This allows us to impose properties like sparsity or
clustering on learned representations, and incorporate human knowledge into the
generative model. Whereas changing the prior only indirectly encourages
behavior through regularizing the encoder, InteL-VAEs are able to directly
enforce desired characteristics. Moreover, they bypass the computation and
encoder design issues caused by non-Gaussian priors, while allowing for
additional flexibility through training of the parametric mapping function. We
show that these advantages, in turn, lead to both better generative models and
better representations being learned.

Jitter is essentially a kind of random loss function. Before training, we
randomly sample the Jitter Point from a specific probability distribution. The
flooding level should be replaced by Jitter point to obtain a new target
function and train the model accordingly. As Jitter point acting as a random
factor, we actually add some randomness to the loss function, which is
consistent with the fact that there exists innumerable random behaviors in the
learning process of the machine learning model and is supposed to make the
model more robust. In addition, Jitter performs random walk randomly which
divides the loss curve into small intervals and then flipping them over,
ideally making the loss curve much flatter and enhancing generalization
ability. Moreover, Jitter can be a domain-, task-, and model-independent
regularization method and train the model effectively after the training error
reduces to zero. Our experimental results show that Jitter method can improve

to study Nash equilibria or social optima in games with a continuum of agents.
These problems can be used to approximate competitive or cooperative games with
a large finite number of agents and have found a broad range of applications,
in particular in economics. In recent years, the question of learning in MFG
and MFC has garnered interest, both as a way to compute solutions and as a way
to model how large populations of learners converge to an equilibrium. Of
particular interest is the setting where the agents do not know the model,
which leads to the development of reinforcement learning (RL) methods. After
reviewing the literature on this topic, we present a two timescale approach
with RL for MFG and MFC, which relies on a unified Q-learning algorithm. The
main novelty of this method is to simultaneously update an action-value
function and a distribution but with different rates, in a model-free fashion.
Depending on the ratio of the two learning rates, the algorithm learns either
the MFG or the MFC solution. To illustrate this method, we apply it to a mean
field problem of accumulated consumption in finite horizon with HARA utility
function, and to a trader's optimal liquidation problem.

Besides the challenges faced due to data acquisition, the networks also

Point Cloud Upsampling (ZSPU). Our approach is data agnostic and relies solely
on the internal information provided by a particular point cloud without
patching in both self-training and testing phases. This single-stream design
significantly reduces the training time by learning the relation between low
resolution (LR) point clouds and their high (original) resolution (HR)

when original point clouds are loaded as input. ZSPU achieves
competitive/superior quantitative and qualitative performances on benchmark

ferromagnets, tacitly assumes that the angular momentum associated with spin
precession can relax instantaneously when the real or effective magnetic field
causing the precession is turned off. This neglect of ""spin inertia"" is
unphysical and would violate energy conservation. Recently, the LLG equation
was modified to account for inertia effects. The consensus, however, seems to
be that such effects would be unimportant in slow magneto-dynamics that take
place over time scales much longer that the relaxation time of the angular
momentum, which is typically few fs to perhaps ~100 ps in ferromagnets. Here,
we show that there is at least one very serious and observable effect of spin
inertia even in slow magneto-dynamics. It involves the switching error
probability associated with flipping the magnetization of a nanoscale
ferromagnet with an external agent, such as a magnetic field. The switching may
take ~ns to complete when the field strength is close to the threshold value
for switching, which is much longer than the angular momentum relaxation time,
and yet the effect of spin inertia is felt in the switching error probability.
This is because the ultimate fate of a switching trajectory, i.e. whether it
results in success or failure, is influenced by what happens in the first few
ps of the switching action when nutational dynamics due to spin inertia holds
sway. Spin inertia increases the error probability, which makes the switching
more error-prone. This has vital technological significance because it relates
to the reliability of magnetic logic and memory.

the particles are represented by momentum eigenstates (i.e. plane waves).
However, strictly speaking, localized free particles should be represented by
wave packets. This yields width corrections to the decay rate and to the clock
behaviour under Lorentz boosts. We calculate the decay rate of a particle of
mass $M$ modeled as a Gaussian wavepacket of width $a$ and centered at zero
momentum. We find the decay rate to be $\Gamma_0 \big[1- \frac{3 a^2}{4 M^2}
+\mathcal{O}\big(\tfrac{a^4}{M^4}\big)\big]$ where $\Gamma_0$ is the decay rate
of the particle at rest treated as a plane wave. The leading correction is then
of order $\tfrac{a^2}{M^2}$. We then perform a Lorentz boost of velocity $v$ on
the above Gaussian and find that its decay rate does not decrease
\textit{exactly} by the Lorentz factor $\sqrt{1-v^2}$. There is a correction of
order $\tfrac{a^2v^2}{M^2}$. Therefore, the decaying wave packet does not act
exactly like a typical clock under Lorentz boosts and we refer to it is a ""WP
clock"" (wave packet clock). A WP clock does not move with a single velocity
relative to an observer but has a spread in velocities (more specifically, a
spread in momenta). Nonetheless, it is best viewed as a single clock as the
wave packet represents a one-particle state in QFT. WP clocks do not violate
Lorentz symmetry and are not based on new physics: they are a consequence of
the combined requirements of special relativity, quantum mechanics and
\textit{localized} free particles.

QAH effect was observed in exfoliated MnBi2Te4 flakes. Here, we used molecular
beam epitaxy (MBE) to grow MnBi2Te4 films with thickness down to 1 septuple

observed a non-square hysteresis loop in the antiferromagnetic state for films

AH components. Through careful analysis, we demonstrated that one AH component
with the larger coercive field is from the dominant MnBi2Te4 phase, while the
other AH component with the smaller coercive field is from the minor Mn-doped
Bi2Te3 phase in the samples. The extracted AH component of the MnBi2Te4 phase

and their analyses. Among various exciting developments, simple SGD-type
updates (potentially on multiple variables) are still prevalent in solving this
class of nested problems, but they are believed to have slower convergence rate

SGD-type updates for stochastic nested problems into a single SGD approach that
we term ALternating Stochastic gradient dEscenT (ALSET) method. By leveraging
the hidden smoothness of the problem, this paper presents a tighter analysis of
ALSET for stochastic nested problems. Under the new analysis, to achieve an

infrared space mission concept developed jointly by JAXA and ESA to address
these questions. The key unique capabilities of SPICA that enable this research
are (1) the wide spectral coverage 10-220 micron, (2) the high line detection
sensitivity of (1-2) 10-19 W m-2 with R~2000-5000 in the far-IR (SAFARI) and

that by using the fluid equations and following a method similar to that for
deriving Blasius' equation, a non-linear model can be obtained whose solutions
display the maximum values of velocity near the edges of the graphene layer. We
argue that such a non-monotonic model and behaviour can shed some light on the
subject of non-topological edge currents in graphene.

monitoring or manipulating the physical effects of computations involving

and traditionally such countermeasures have been developed for each attack
vector separately. We demonstrate a multipurpose ring oscillator design -
Programmable Ring Oscillator (PRO) to address both fault attacks and
side-channel attacks in a generic, application-independent manner. PRO, as an
integrated primitive, can provide on-chip side-channel resistance, power
monitoring, and fault detection capabilities to a secure design. We present a
grid of PROs monitoring the on-chip power network to detect anomalies. Such
power anomalies may be caused by external factors such as electromagnetic fault
injection and power glitches, as well as by internal factors such as hardware
Trojans. By monitoring the frequency of the ring oscillators, we are able to
detect the on-chip power anomaly in time as well as in location. Moreover, we
show that the PROs can also inject a random noise pattern into a design's power
consumption. By randomly switching the frequency of a ring oscillator, the
resulting power-noise pattern significantly reduces the power-based
side-channel leakage of a cipher. We discuss the design of PRO and present
measurement results on a Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA prototype, and we show that
side-channel and fault vulnerabilities can be addressed at a low cost by
introducing PRO to the design. We conclude that PRO can serve as an
application-independent, multipurpose countermeasure.

dynamic active learning functions that decide when to call the HF model. We
demonstrate our framework using several academic case studies and two finite

Stokes approximation and estimating stresses in a transversely isotropic model
subjected to displacements via a coarsely meshed isotropic model. Across these

conditions such as local Lorentz invariance. We first use teleparallel gravity
to formulate a teleparallel equivalent of general relativity which is
dynamically equivalent to general relativity but which may have different
behaviors for other scenarios, such as quantum gravity. After setting this
foundation, we describe the plethora of modified teleparallel theories of
gravity that have been proposed in the literature. In the second part of the
Review, we first survey works in teleparallel astrophysics literature where we
focus on the open questions in this regime of physics. We then discuss the
cosmological consequences for the various formulations of teleparallel gravity.
We do this at background level by exploring works using various approaches
ranging from dynamical systems to Noether symmetries, and more. Naturally, we
then discuss perturbation theory, firstly by giving a concise approach in which
this can be applied in teleparallel gravity theories and then apply it to a
number of important theories in the literature. Finally, we examine works in
observational and precision cosmology across the plethora of proposal theories.
This is done using some of the latest observations and is used to tackle
cosmological tensions which may be alleviated in teleparallel cosmology. We
also introduce a number of recent works in the application of machine learning
to gravity, we do this through deep learning and Gaussian processes, together
with discussions about other approaches in the literature.

image translation for data augmentation. We first propose a lightweight yet
efficient model for translating texture to augment images based on a single
input of source texture, allowing for fast training and testing, referred to as
Single Image Texture Translation for data Augmentation (SITTA). Then we explore
the use of augmented data in long-tailed and few-shot image classification
tasks. We find the proposed augmentation method and workflow is capable of
translating the texture of input data into a target domain, leading to
consistently improved image recognition performance. Finally, we examine how
SITTA and related image translation methods can provide a basis for a
data-efficient, ""augmentation engineering"" approach to model training. Codes

performance indices such as energy or power norms or energy measurements when
norms are not defined. They apply to a class of systems for which a stochastic
process conveys the underlying uncertainties, known as CSVIU (Control and State
Variation Increase Uncertainty). These indices allow various emphases from
focusing on the transient behavior with the discounted norm to stricter
conditions on stability, steady-state mean-square error and convergence rate,
using the optimal overtaking criterion -- the long-run average power control
stands as a midpoint in this respect. A critical advance regards the explicit
form of the optimal control law, expressed in two equivalent forms. One takes a
perturbed affine Riccati-like form of feedback solution; the other comes from a
generalized normal equation that arises from the nondifferentiable local
optimal problem. They are equivalent, but the latter allows for a search method
to attain the optimal law. A detectability notion and a Riccati solution grant
stochastic stability from the behavior of the norms. The energy overtaking
criterion requires a further constraint on a matrix spectral radius. With these
findings, the paper revisits the emerging of the inaction solution, a prominent
feature of CSVIU models to deal with the uncertainty inherent to poorly known
models. Besides, it provides the optimal solution and the tools to pursue it.

to difficulties in quantifying the contamination of flux-based estimates of
star formation from unrelated phenomena, such as AGN and old stellar
populations. We here utilise core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) as unambiguous
tracers of recent star formation in ellipticals within a cosmic volume. We
firstly isolate a sample of 421 z < 0.2, r < 21.8 mag CCSNe from the SDSS-II
Supernova Survey. We then introduce a Bayesian method of identifying
ellipticals via their colours and morphologies in a manner unbiased by redshift
and yet consistent with manual classification from Galaxy Zoo 1. We find ~ 25 %
of z < 0.2 r < 20 mag galaxies in the Stripe 82 region are ellipticals (~ 28000
galaxies). In total, 36 CCSNe are found to reside in ellipticals. We
demonstrate that such early-types contribute a non-negligible fraction of star
formation to the present-day cosmic budget, at 11.2 $\pm$ 3.1 (stat)
$^{+3.0}_{-4.2}$ (sys) %. Coupling this result with the galaxy stellar mass
function of ellipticals, the mean specific star formation rate (SSFR;
$\overline{S}$) of these systems is derived. The best-fit slope is given by log
($\overline{S}(M)$/yr) = - (0.80 $\pm$ 0.59) log ($M/10^{10.5}\rm{M}_{\odot}$)
- 10.83 $\pm$ 0.18. The mean SSFR for all log ($M/\rm{M}_{\odot}$) > 10.0
ellipticals is found to be $\overline{S} = 9.2 \pm 2.4$ (stat) $^{+2.7}_{-2.3}$
(sys) $\times 10^{-12}$ yr$^{-1}$, which is consistent with recent estimates
via SED-fitting, and is 11.8 $\pm$ 3.7 (stat) $^{+3.5}_{-2.9}$ (sys) % of the
mean SSFR level on the main sequence as also derived from CCSNe. We find the
median optical spectrum of elliptical CCSN hosts is statistically consistent
with that of a control sample of ellipticals that do not host CCSNe, implying
that these SN-derived results are well-representative of the total low-z
elliptical population.

redshift selection including both Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescope photometry

vetting procedure, including screening for persistence, stellar contamination,
inclusion of ground-based imaging, and followup space-based imaging to build a
robust sample of 11 candidate galaxies, three presented here for the first
time. The inclusion of Spitzer/IRAC photometry in the selection process reduces
contamination, and yields more robust redshift estimates than Hubble alone. We
constrain the evolution of the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity function via a
new method of calculating the observed number densities without choosing a
prior magnitude bin size. We find that the abundance at our brightest probed
luminosities (M_UV=-22.3) is consistent with predictions from simulations which
assume that galaxies in this epoch have gas depletion times at least as short
as those in nearby starburst galaxies. Due to large Poisson and cosmic variance
uncertainties we cannot conclusively rule out either a smooth evolution of the
luminosity function continued from z=4-8, or an accelerate decline at z > 8. We
calculate that the presence of seven galaxies in a single field (EGS) is an
outlier at the 2-sigma significance level, implying the discovery of a
significant overdensity. These scenarios will be imminently testable to high
confidence within the first year of observations of the James Webb Space

scaling relations between the cluster mass and three observable mass proxies:
the gas temperature, the Compton $Y$-parameter of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect
and the X-ray analogue of the $Y$-parameter. Therefore, unless properly

tests that make use of cluster observations, such as cluster number counts, to

its performance, but, additionally, its constancy, i.e. the stability of the

of massive black holes in the center of galaxies, but their origin is still
poorly known. Different scenarios for the formation and evolution of massive
black holes lead to different predictions for their properties and merger
rates. LISA observations of coalescing massive black hole binaries could be
used to reverse engineer the problem and shed light on these mechanisms. In
this paper, we introduce a pipeline based on hierarchical Bayesian inference to
infer the mixing fraction between different theoretical models by comparing
them to LISA observations of massive black hole mergers. By testing this
pipeline against simulated LISA data, we show that it allows us to accurately
infer the properties of the massive black hole population as long as our
theoretical models provide a reliable description of the Universe. We also show
that measurement errors, including both instrumental noise and weak lensing
errors, have little impact on the inference.

uninformative. We find that a source-frame total mass of $\sim$$150 M_{\odot}$
is consistently supported, but posteriors in mass ratio and spin depend
critically on the choice of priors. We confirm that the likelihood has a
multi-modal structure with peaks in regions of mass ratio representing very
different astrophysical scenarios. The unequal-mass region ($m_2 / m_1 < 0.3$)
has an average likelihood $\sim$$e^6$ times larger than the equal-mass region
and a maximum likelihood $\sim$$e^2$ larger. Using ensembles of samples across
priors, we examine the implications of qualitatively different BBH sources that
fit the data. We find that the equal-mass solution has poorly constrained spins
and at least one black hole mass that is difficult to form via stellar collapse
due to (pulsational) pair instability. The unequal-mass solution can avoid this
mass gap entirely but requires a negative effective spin and a precessing
primary. Both of these scenarios are more easily produced by dynamical
formation channels than field binary co-evolution. Drawing representative
samples from each region of the likelihood map, we find a sensitive comoving
volume-time $\mathcal{O}(10)$ times larger in the mass gap region than the
gap-avoiding region. Accounting for this distance effect, the likelihood still
reverses the advantage to favor the gap-avoiding scenario by a factor of
$\mathcal{O}(100)$ before including mass and spin priors. Posterior samplers
can be driven away from this high-likelihood region by common prior choices
meant to be uninformative, making GW190521 parameter inference sensitive to the
choice of mass and spin priors. This may be a generic issue for similarly heavy
events given current detector sensitivity and waveform degeneracies.

controlled single-excitation gates in the form of Givens rotations are
universal for particle-conserving unitaries. Single-excitation gates describe
an arbitrary $U(2)$ rotation on the two-qubit subspace spanned by the states
$|01\rangle, |10\rangle$, while leaving other states unchanged -- a
transformation that is analogous to a single-qubit rotation on a dual-rail

method for compiling arbitrary particle-conserving unitaries. Additionally, we
describe a method for using controlled single-excitation gates to prepare an
arbitrary state of a fixed number of particles. We derive analytical gradient

CNOT gates. Our results offer a unifying framework for quantum computational
chemistry where every algorithm is a unique recipe built from the same

antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbour coupling, subject to an external
quasiperiodic on-site magnetic field. The quasiperiodic modulation interpolates
between two paradigmatic models, namely the Aubry-Andr\'e and the Fibonacci
models. We find that stronger many-body interactions extend the ergodic phase
in the former, whereas they shrink it in the latter. Furthermore, the many-body
localization transition points at the two limits of the interpolation appear to
be continuously connected along the deformation. As a result, the position of
the many-body localization transition depends on the interaction strength for
an intermediate degree of deformation of the quasiperiodic modulation.
Moreover, in the region of parameter space where the single-particle spectrum
contains both localized and extended states, many-body interactions induce an
anomalous effect: weak interactions localize the system, whereas stronger
interactions enhance ergodicity. We map the model's localization phase diagram
using the decay of the quenched spin imbalance in relatively long chains. This
is accomplished employing a time-dependent variational approach applied to a
matrix product state decomposition of the many-body state. Our model serves as
a rich playground for testing many-body localization under tunable potentials.

inferences by uploading inputs (e.g., images) to a server (i.e., cloud) where
the heavy deep learning models run. While this setup works cost-effectively for
successful inferences, it severely underperforms when the model faces input
samples on which the model was not trained (known as Out-of-Distribution (OOD)
samples). If the edge devices could, at least, detect that an input sample is
an OOD, that could potentially save communication and computation resources by
not uploading those inputs to the server for inference workload. In this paper,
we propose a novel lightweight OOD detection approach that mines important
features from the shallow layers of a pretrained CNN model and detects an input
sample as ID (In-Distribution) or OOD based on a distance function defined on
the reduced feature space. Our technique (a) works on pretrained models without
any retraining of those models, and (b) does not expose itself to any OOD
dataset (all detection parameters are obtained from the ID training dataset).
To this end, we develop EARLIN (EARLy OOD detection for Collaborative
INference) that takes a pretrained model and partitions the model at the OOD
detection layer and deploys the considerably small OOD part on an edge device
and the rest on the cloud. By experimenting using real datasets and a prototype
implementation, we show that our technique achieves better results than other
approaches in terms of overall accuracy and cost when tested against popular
OOD datasets on top of popular deep learning models pretrained on benchmark

often encountered in simulations of chaotic systems, this up-front cost can be
prohibitive. In this work, a correlation estimation procedure is developed for
the case in which the highest and next highest fidelity models are generated
via discretizing the same mathematical model using different resolution. The
procedure uses discretization error estimates to estimate the required
correlation coefficient without the need to sample the highest fidelity model,
which can dramatically decrease the cost of the preprocessing phase. The method
is extended to chaotic problems by using discretization error estimates that
account for the statistical nature of common quantities of interest and the
accompanying finite sampling errors that pollute estimates of such quantities
of interest. The methodology is then demonstrated on a model problem based on
the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.

Characterizing the evolution of protoplanetary disks is necessary to
improve our understanding of planet formation. Constraints on both dust and gas
are needed to determine the dominant disk dissipation mechanisms. Aims. We aim
to compare the disk dust masses in the Chamaeleon II (Cha II) star-forming
region with other regions with ages between 1 and 10Myr. Methods. We use ALMA
band 6 observations (1.3 mm) to survey 29 protoplanetary disks in Cha II. Dust
mass estimates are derived from the continuum data. Results. Out of our initial
sample of 29 disks, we detect 22 sources in the continuum, 10 in 12CO, 3 in
13CO, and none in C18O (J=2-1). Additionally, we detect two companion
candidates in the continuum and 12CO emission. Most disk dust masses are lower
than 10Mearth, assuming thermal emission from optically thin dust. We compare
consistent estimations of the distributions of the disk dust mass and the
disk-to-stellar mass ratios in Cha II with six other low mass and isolated
star-forming regions in the age range of 1-10Myr: Upper Sco, CrA, IC 348, Cha
I, Lupus, and Taurus. When comparing the dust-to-stellar mass ratio, we find
that the masses of disks in Cha II are statistically different from those in
Upper Sco and Taurus, and we confirm that disks in Upper Sco, the oldest region
of the sample, are statistically less massive than in all other regions.
Performing a second statistical test of the dust mass distributions from
similar mass bins, we find no statistical differences between these regions and
Cha II. Conclusions. We interpret these trends, most simply, as a sign of
decline in the disk dust masses with time or dust evolution. Different global
initial conditions in star-forming regions may also play a role, but their
impact on the properties of a disk population is difficult to isolate in
star-forming regions lacking nearby massive stars.

demonstrate here, by an experimental-theoretical approach, that the
incorporation of nitrogen molecules (N2) into the BP structure results in a
relevant improvement of its stability in air, up to 8 days without optical

vacancies) by electron-beam irradiation, followed by their healing with N2
molecules. As an additional route, N2 plasma treatment is presented as an
alternative for large area application. Our first principles calculations
elucidate the mechanisms involved in the nitrogen incorporation as well as on
the stabilization of the modified BP, which corroborates with our experimental

viable for high-performance and latency-sensitive applications, we present
rFaaS, an RDMA-accelerated FaaS platform. We identify critical limitations of
serverless - centralized scheduling and inefficient network transport - and
improve the FaaS architecture with allocation leases and microsecond
invocations. We show that our remote functions add only negligible overhead on
top of the fastest available networks, and we decrease the execution latency by
orders of magnitude compared to contemporary FaaS systems. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the performance of rFaaS by evaluating real-world FaaS benchmarks

Finding IMBHs in globular star clusters (GCs) would validate a formation

candidates in the Virgo Cluster galaxy NGC\,4472. Interpreting the radio

radio luminosities suggests access to $M_{\rm IMBH}^{\rm FP} \sim
10^{1.7-3.6}~M_\odot$, with an uncertainty of 0.44 dex. (3) A fiducial Bondi
accretion model was applied to all 728 GC candidates and to radio stacks of GC

As such, their outcome on a given datum involves no uncertainty, so we must
specify what variability we are referring to when defining, measuring and

end, we introduce the Wellington Posterior, which is the distribution of

infinitely many scenes that could have generated any given image, the
Wellington Posterior involves inductive transfer from scenes other than the one

previous methods by: (i) reaching SOTA task performance while also providing
explanations, (ii) providing two types of explanations, while existing models
usually provide only one type, and (iii) beating by a large margin the previous
SOTA in terms of quality of both types of explanations. Furthermore, a

insightful numerical examples in our previous computational work. This paper
presents a numerical analysis of this LDG method, focusing on the free boundary
case. The problem consists of minimizing a fourth order bending energy subject
to a nonlinear and nonconvex metric constraint. The energy is discretized using
LDG and a discrete gradient flow is used for computing discrete minimizers. We
first show $\Gamma$-convergence of the discrete energy to the continuous one.
Then we prove that the discrete gradient flow decreases the energy at each step
and computes discrete minimizers with control of the metric constraint defect.
We also present a numerical scheme for initialization of the gradient flow, and
discuss the conditional stability of it.

deformations for a variety of materials. In contrast to local mechanics,
peridynamic boundary conditions must be defined on a finite volume region
outside the body. Therefore, theoretical and numerical challenges arise in
order to properly formulate Dirichlet-type nonlocal boundary conditions, while
connecting them to the local counterparts. While a careless imposition of local
boundary conditions leads to a smaller effective material stiffness close to
the boundary and an artificial softening of the material, several strategies
were proposed to avoid this unphysical surface effect.
  In this work, we study convergence of solutions to nonlocal state-based
linear elastic model to their local counterparts as the interaction horizon
vanishes, under different formulations and smoothness assumptions for nonlocal
Dirichlet-type boundary conditions. Our results provide explicit rates of
convergence that are sensitive to the compatibility of the nonlocal boundary
data and the extension of the solution for the local model. In particular,
under appropriate assumptions, constant extensions yield $\frac{1}{2}$ order
convergence rates and linear extensions yield $\frac{3}{2}$ order convergence
rates. With smooth extensions, these rates are improved to quadratic
convergence. We illustrate the theory for any dimension $d\geq 2$ and
numerically verify the convergence rates with a number of two dimensional
benchmarks, including linear patch tests, manufactured solutions, and domains
with curvilinear surfaces. Numerical results show a first order convergence for
constant extensions and second order convergence for linear extensions, which
suggests a possible room of improvement in the future convergence analysis.

an extension of the seminal Revolve algorithm adapted to multistage schemes.
The second algorithm, named CAMS, is developed based on dynamic programming,

reduction and feature extraction. Robust PCA (RPCA), under different robust
distance metrics, such as l1-norm and l2, p-norm, can deal with noise or
outliers to some extent. However, real-world data may display structures that
can not be fully captured by these simple functions. In addition, existing
methods treat complex and simple samples equally. By contrast, a learning
pattern typically adopted by human beings is to learn from simple to complex
and less to more. Based on this principle, we propose a novel method called
Self-paced PCA (SPCA) to further reduce the effect of noise and outliers.
Notably, the complexity of each sample is calculated at the beginning of each
iteration in order to integrate samples from simple to more complex into
training. Based on an alternating optimization, SPCA finds an optimal
projection matrix and filters out outliers iteratively. Theoretical analysis is
presented to show the rationality of SPCA. Extensive experiments on popular
data sets demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the state of-the-art
results considerably.

in order to estimate the jet velocity within 0.65 mas of the point of origin.
The image captured a high signal to noise, double-ridged, counter-jet extending
$\sim 1$ mas from the nucleus. After defining conditions and requirements that
justify approximate time averaged bilateral symmetry, a continuous set of
Lorentz transformations are found that map the double-ridged counter-jet
intensity profile into the double-ridged jet intensity profile. The mapping is
realized by a uniformly accelerating flow with intrinsic velocity of $\sim
0.27$c at 0.4 mas (a de-projected distance of 0.38 lt-yrs) to $0.38$c at 0.65
mas (a de-projected distance of 0.61 lt-yrs) from the nucleus. Since the
velocity field is derived from the global surface brightness profile and does
not depend on the motion of enhanced features, it is most likely a bulk flow
velocity as opposed to a pattern velocity. This interpretation is corroborated
by the fact that the distribution of the apparent velocities of previously
identified individual features (from the literature) within 0.65 mas of the
nucleus are consistent with local hydrodynamic shocks being advected with the
local bulk flow velocity. The bulk flow velocity of the visible inner jet is a
constraint that can potentially break degeneracies between numerical
simulations that are designed to replicate both the annulus that was imaged by
the Event Horizon Telescope as well as the base of the inner jet.

novel technique to enable multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication
in optical networks. HSM uses the spectral space of ultrashort laser pulses to
create line codes in the form of 2D holograms. The pulse processing is
performed in the temporal Fourier domain by spatially dispersing the pulse
frequency components in a spectral processing device (SPD). The 2D holograms
are composed of the patterns of intensity disparities that an SLM inscribes on
the spectrally-decomposed Fourier plane of the pulse. The holographic line
codes defined in this way transform the ultrashort laser pulses into
high-entropy data symbols, hence, enhance the communication's spectral
efficiency. Unlike conventional optical multiplexing schemes (e.g., TDM, WDM,
or SDM), HSM does not physically or abstractly separate the communication
propagation space into subchannels. Rather, HSM realizes a MIMO communication
paradigm by allowing the photonic waves under the pulse envelope to propagate
in the same space so they scatter and interfere by chromatic dispersion. This
allows HSM to form beams between the pixels of SLM at the sender and receiver
sides and optimize the beam to adapt to channel scattering situations. In this
way, HSM delivers a rate gain that in the best case exponentially increases the
information rate of communication.

performance through implicit regularization. One way to alleviate the effects
of heterogeneity is to encourage the alignment of gradients across different
clients throughout training. Our analysis reveals that this goal can be
accomplished by utilizing the right optimization method that replicates the
implicit regularization effect of SGD, leading to gradient alignment as well as
improvements in test accuracies. Since the existence of this regularization in
SGD completely relies on the sequential use of different mini-batches during
training, it is inherently absent when training with large mini-batches. To
obtain the generalization benefits of this regularization while increasing
parallelism, we propose a novel GradAlign algorithm that induces the same
implicit regularization while allowing the use of arbitrarily large batches in
each update. We experimentally validate the benefits of our algorithm in
different distributed and federated learning settings.

that are built by differential equations (DE). However, their expressive power
when they are deployed on computers is bottlenecked by numerical DE solvers.
This limitation has significantly slowed down the scaling and understanding of
numerous natural physical phenomena such as the dynamics of nervous systems.
Ideally, we would circumvent this bottleneck by solving the given dynamical
system in closed form. This is known to be intractable in general. Here, we
show it is possible to closely approximate the interaction between neurons and
synapses -- the building blocks of natural and artificial neural networks --
constructed by liquid time-constant networks (LTCs) efficiently in closed-form.
To this end, we compute a tightly-bounded approximation of the solution of an
integral appearing in LTCs' dynamics, that has had no known closed-form
solution so far. This closed-form solution substantially impacts the design of
continuous-time and continuous-depth neural models; for instance, since time
appears explicitly in closed-form, the formulation relaxes the need for complex
numerical solvers. Consequently, we obtain models that are between one and five
orders of magnitude faster in training and inference compared to differential
equation-based counterparts. More importantly, in contrast to ODE-based
continuous networks, closed-form networks can scale remarkably well compared to
other deep learning instances. Lastly, as these models are derived from liquid
networks, they show remarkable performance in time series modeling, compared to
advanced recurrent models.

  https://preregister.science/",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning guarantees often rely on assumptions of i.i.d. data, which will
likely be violated in practice once predictors are deployed to perform
real-world tasks. Domain adaptation approaches thus appeared as a useful
framework yielding extra flexibility in that distinct train and test data
distributions are supported, provided that other assumptions are satisfied such
as covariate shift, which expects the conditional distributions over labels to
be independent of the underlying data distribution. Several approaches were
introduced in order to induce generalization across varying train and test data
sources, and those often rely on the general idea of domain-invariance, in such
a way that the data-generating distributions are to be disregarded by the
prediction model. In this contribution, we tackle the problem of generalizing
across data sources by approaching it from the opposite direction: we consider
a conditional modeling approach in which predictions, in addition to being
dependent on the input data, use information relative to the underlying
data-generating distribution. For instance, the model has an explicit mechanism
to adapt to changing environments and/or new data sources. We argue that such
an approach is more generally applicable than current domain adaptation methods
since it does not require extra assumptions such as covariate shift and further
yields simpler training algorithms that avoid a common source of training
instabilities caused by minimax formulations, often employed in
domain-invariant methods.

  Study",,,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Context: Refactoring is the art of modifying the design of a system without
altering its behavior. The idea is to reorganize variables, classes and methods
to facilitate their future adaptations and comprehension. As the concept of
behavior preservation is fundamental for refactoring, several studies, using
formal verification, language transformation and dynamic analysis, have been
proposed to monitor the execution of refactoring operations and their impact on
the program semantics. However, there is no existing study that examines the
available behavior preservation strategies for each refactoring operation.
  Objective: This paper identifies behavior preservation approaches in the
research literature.
  Method: We conduct, in this paper, a systematic mapping study, to capture all
existing behavior preservation approaches that we classify based on several
criteria including their methodology, applicability, and their degree of
automation.
  Results: The results indicate that several behavior preservation approaches
have been proposed in the literature. The approaches vary between using
formalisms and techniques, developing automatic refactoring safety tools, and
performing a manual analysis of the source code.
  Conclusion: Our taxonomy reveals that there exist some types of refactoring
operations whose behavior preservation is under-researched. Our classification
also indicates that several possible strategies can be combined to better
detect any violation of the program semantics.

(GC) candidates that need to be further investigated. Our main objective is to
use public data from the Gaia Mission, VVV, 2MASS and WISE in order to measure
the physical parameters of Minni48, a new candidate GC located in the inner
bulge of the Galaxy at l=359.35 deg, b=2.79 deg. Even though there is a bright
foreground star contaminating the field, the cluster appears quite bright in
near- and mid-IR images. We obtain deep decontaminated optical and near-IR
colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) for this cluster. The heliocentric cluster
distance is determined from the red clump (RC) and the red giant branch (RGB)
tip magnitudes in the near-IR CMD, while the cluster metallicity is estimated
from the RGB slope and the fit to theoretical isochrones. The GC size is found
to be r = 6' +/- 1', while reddening and extinction values are E(J-Ks)=0.60 +/-
0.05 mag, A_G=3.23 +/- 0.10 mag, A_Ks=0.45 +/- 0.05 mag. The resulting mean
Gaia proper motions are PMRA=-3.5 +/- 0.5 mas/yr, PMDEC=-6.0 +/- 0.5 mas/yr.
The IR magnitude of the RC yields an accurate distance modulus estimate of
(m-M)_0=14.61 mag, equivalent to a distance D=8.4 +/- 1.0 kpc. This is
consistent with the optical distance estimate: (m-M)_0=14.67 mag, D=8.6 +/- 1.0
kpc, and with the RGB tip distance: (m-M)_0=14.45 mag, D=7.8 +/- 1.0 kpc. The
derived metallicity is [Fe/H]=-0.20 +/- 0.30 dex. A good fit to the PARSEC
stellar isochrones is obtained in all CMDs using Age = 10 +/- 2 Gyr. The total
absolute magnitude of this GC is estimated to be M_Ks= -9.04 +/- 0.66 mag.
Based on its position, kinematics, metallicity and age, we conclude that
Minni48 is a genuine GC, similar to other well known metal-rich bulge GCs. It
is located at a projected Galactocentric angular distance of 2.9 deg,
equivalent to 0.4 kpc, being one of the closest GCs to the Galactic centre.

weights leads to accuracy degradation due to complex interactions between the

and established subject for designing proper neutron guides. However, sometimes
unusual adaptation or adjustments are required out of original projects and
after operation beginning of facilities. Inter-center transferring of
instrument locations also requires a new approach that is not necessarily
described in the literature. Inside these situations, the use of S-shaped
guides has not been fully discussed in the literature. From a geometrical
analysis, we develop a formalism of construction of a minimal S-shaped guide by
only considering the exclusion of the Line-of-Sight. We study this guide model
through the wavelength cutoff and the neutron transport efficiency analysis.
Here, Monte Carlo simulations using MCSTAS software are applied. By intending
to optimize these guide systems, simulations of this study also consider
scenarios that have different supermirrors. A formalism to determine wavelength
cutoff for unique and variable index guide systems is also developed.
Simulation results show a good agreement between theoretical and simulated
wavelength cutoff values. In addition, we have found specific configurations
that combine efficient neutron transport and lower index values on the convex
surfaces of curved guides that form the S-shaped guide.

heuristics reveals that some classic algorithms are even more effective in
terms of solution quality and computation time. The non-quantum advantage is
due to the fact that current implementation is a semi-quantum proof-of-concept

Nevertheless, the proposed framework is highly flexible and holds tremendous

visco-elastic fluid. Particles are charged and constrained to move in a two
dimensional harmonic trap. Their dynamics is coupled to a constant magnetic
field applied perpendicular to their motion via Lorentz force. Due to the
finite activity, the generalised fluctuation-dissipation relation (GFDR) breaks
down, driving the system away from equilibrium. While breaking GFDR, we have
shown that the system can have finite classical orbital magnetism only when the
dynamics of the system contains finite inertia. The orbital magnetic moment has
been calculated exactly. Remarkably, we find that when the elastic dissipation
time scale of the medium is larger (smaller) than the persistence time scale of
the self-propelling particles, the system is diamagnetic (paramagnetic).
Therefore, for a given strength of the magnetic field, the system undergoes a
novel transition from diamagnetic to paramagnetic state (and vice-versa) simply
by tuning the time scales of underlying physical processes, such as, active
fluctuations and visco-elastic dissipation. Interestingly, we also find that
the magnetic moment, which vanishes at equilibrium, behaves non-monotonically
with respect to increasing persistence of self-propulsion, that drives the
system out of equilibrium

Ideally, the style transfer manipulation should also preserve the semantic
content of the source image. A commonly used approach to assist in transferring
styles is based on Gram matrix optimization. One problem of Gram matrix-based
optimization is that it does not consider the correlation between colors and
their styles. Specifically, certain textures or structures should be associated
with specific colors. This is particularly challenging when the target style
image exhibits multiple style types. In this work, we propose a color-aware
multi-style transfer method that generates aesthetically pleasing results while
preserving the style-color correlation between style and generated images. We
achieve this desired outcome by introducing a simple but efficient modification
to classic Gram matrix-based style transfer optimization. A nice feature of our
method is that it enables the users to manually select the color associations
between the target style and content image for more transfer flexibility. We
validated our method with several qualitative comparisons, including a user

distribution, we extend their approach here to three emblematic settings: when
the background distribution is symmetric; when it is monotonic; and when it is
log-concave. In each setting, we derive estimators for the background
component, establish consistency, and provide a confidence band. While the
estimation of a background component is straightforward when it is taken to be
symmetric or monotonic, when it is log-concave its estimation requires the
computation of a largest concave minorant, which we implement using sequential
quadratic programming. Compared to existing methods, our method has the
advantage of requiring much less prior knowledge on the background component,

fundamental requirement for practical applications. While many efforts have
been made to develop architectural capabilities for enforcing confidential
smart contracts, a few works arise to extend confidential smart contracts to
Multi-Party Computation (MPC), i.e., multiple parties jointly evaluate a
transaction off-chain and commit the outputs on-chain without revealing their
secret inputs/outputs to each other. However, existing solutions lack public
verifiability and require O(n) transactions to enable negotiation or resist
adversaries, thus suffering from inefficiency and compromised security. In this
paper, we propose Cloak, a framework for enabling Multi-Party Transaction (MPT)
on existing blockchains. An MPT refers to transitioning blockchain states by an
publicly verifiable off-chain MPC. We identify and handle the challenges of
securing MPT by harmonizing TEE and blockchain. Consequently, Cloak secures the
off-chain nondeterministic negotiation process (a party joins an MPT without
knowing identities or the total number of parties until the MPT proposal
settles), achieves public verifiability (the public can validate that the MPT
correctly handles the secret inputs/outputs from multiple parties and
reads/writes states on-chain), and resists Byzantine adversaries. According to
our proof, Cloak achieves better security with only 2 transactions, superior to
previous works that achieve compromised security at O(n) transactions cost. By
evaluating examples and real-world MPTs, the gas cost of Cloak reduces by 32.4%
on average.

to propose an intelligent optimization system based on metaphor, and hinders

However, it is difficult to directly discuss the search behavior of an

intelligent schemes. To address this problem, an intelligent optimization
system is regarded as a simulated physical optimization system in this paper.
The dynamic search behavior of such a simplified physical optimization system
are investigated with quantum theory. To achieve this goal, the Schroedinger
equation is employed as the dynamics equation of the optimization algorithm,
which is used to describe dynamic search behaviours in the evolution process
with quantum theory. Moreover, to explore the basic behaviour of the
optimization system, the optimization problem is assumed to be decomposed and
approximated. Correspondingly, the basic search behaviour is derived, which
constitutes the basic iterative process of a simple optimization system. The
basic iterative process is compared with some classical bare-bones schemes to
verify the similarity of search behavior under different metaphors. The search
strategies of these bare bones algorithms are analyzed through experiments.

  Models","10 pages, 7 figures, accepted by ICSME 2021",,,,"cs.SE cs.AI cs.PL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Code completion is widely used by software developers to provide coding
suggestions given a partially written code snippet. Apart from the traditional
code completion methods, which only support single token completion at minimal
positions, recent studies show the ability to provide longer code completion at
more flexible positions. However, such frequently triggered and longer
completion results reduce the overall precision as they generate more invalid
results. Moreover, different studies are mostly incompatible with each other.
Thus, it is vital to develop an ensemble framework that can combine results
from multiple models to draw merits and offset defects of each model.
  This paper conducts a coding simulation to collect data from code context and
different code completion models and then apply the data in two tasks. First,
we introduce an acceptance model which can dynamically control whether to
display completion results to the developer. It uses simulation features to
predict whether correct results exist in the output of these models. Our best
model reduces the percentage of false-positive completion from 55.09% to
17.44%. Second, we design a fusion ranking scheme that can automatically
identify the priority of the completion results and reorder the candidates from
multiple code completion models. This scheme is flexible in dealing with
various models, regardless of the type or the length of their completion
results. We integrate this ranking scheme with two frequency models and a GPT-2
styled language model, along with the acceptance model to yield 27.80% and
37.64% increase in TOP1 and TOP5 accuracy, respectively. In addition, we
propose a new code completion evaluation metric, Benefit-Cost Ratio(BCR),
taking into account the benefit of keystrokes saving and hidden cost of
completion list browsing, which is closer to real coder experience scenario.

matching. To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose a novel method named
Dual-stream Reciprocal Disentanglement Learning (DRDL), which is quite
efficient in learning domain-invariant features. In DRDL, two encoders are
first constructed for id-related and id-unrelated feature extractions, which
are respectively measured by their associated classifiers. Furthermore,
followed by an adversarial learning strategy, both streams reciprocally and
positively effect each other, so that the id-related features and id-unrelated
features are completely disentangled from a given image, allowing the encoder
to be powerful enough to obtain the discriminative but domain-invariant
features. In contrast to existing approaches, our proposed method is free from
image generation, which not only reduces the computational complexity
remarkably, but also removes redundant information from id-related features.
Extensive experiments substantiate the superiority of our proposed method

barriers made of CrBr3 -- the sole van der Waals ferromagnet investigated in
this way -- were found to exhibit small and featureless magnetoconductance,

despite these early results -- the conductance of CrBr3 tunnel barriers does
provide detailed information about the magnetic state of atomically thin CrBr3
crystals for $T$ both above and below the Curie temperature ($T_C = 32$ K). Our
analysis establishes that the tunneling conductance depends on $H$ and $T$
exclusively through the magnetization $M(H,T)$, over the entire temperature
range investigated (2-50 K). The phenomenon is reproduced in detail by the
spin-dependent Fowler-Nordheim model for tunneling, and is a direct
manifestation of the spin splitting of the CrBr3 conduction band. These
findings demonstrate that the investigation of magnetism by tunneling
conductance measurements is not limited to antiferromagnets, but can also be
applied to ferromagnetic materials.

design of robot skills can often be intractable in real-world applications due
to the prohibitive amount of effort and expertise that it requires. In this
work, we introduce Skill Learning In Diversified Environments (SLIDE), a method
to discover generalizable skills via automated generation of a diverse set of
tasks. As opposed to prior work on unsupervised discovery of skills which
incentivizes the skills to produce different outcomes in the same environment,
our method pairs each skill with a unique task produced by a trainable task
generator. To encourage generalizable skills to emerge, our method trains each
skill to specialize in the paired task and maximizes the diversity of the
generated tasks. A task discriminator defined on the robot behaviors in the
generated tasks is jointly trained to estimate the evidence lower bound of the
diversity objective. The learned skills can then be composed in a hierarchical

major features, worldviews and resource tunneling, which behave analogously to
quantum superposition and quantum tunneling. We use the quantum physicist's
method to extend the Automatic Amortized Resource Analysis (AARA) type system,
enabling the derivation of resource bounds based on tree depth. In doing so, we
also introduce remainder contexts, which aid bookkeeping in linear type
systems. We then evaluate this new type system's performance by bounding stack
use of functions in the Set module of OCaml's standard library. Compared to
state-of-the-art implementations of AARA, our new system derives tighter bounds

adjusting only the power allocation ratio of a unified signal. For this, we
design a novel unified and integrated receiver architecture for the proposed

To relieve the computational complexity of the receiver, we propose an adaptive
control algorithm by which the transmitter adjusts the communication mode
through temporal convolutional network (TCN) based asymmetric processing. To
this end, the transmitter optimizes the modulation index and power allocation
ratio in short-term scale while updating the mode switching threshold in
long-term scale. We demonstrate that the proposed unified SWIPT system improves
the achievable rate under the self-powering condition of low-power IoT devices.
Consequently it is foreseen to effectively deploy low-power IoT networks that
concurrently supply both information and energy wirelessly to the devices by
using the proposed unified SWIPT and adaptive control algorithm in place at the

finite-time adaptive backstepping control scheme is presented for the attitude

First, an adaptive smooth disturbance observer (ASDO) is proposed to estimate
the composite disturbance, which owns the characteristics of smooth output,
fast finite-time convergence, and adaptability to the disturbance of unknown
derivative boundary. Then, a finite-time backstepping control protocol is
construct to drive the elevation and pitch angles to track reference
trajectories. To tackle the ""explosion of complexity"" and ""singularity""
problems in the conventional backstepping design framework, a fast finite-time
command filter (FFTCF) is utilized to estimate the virtual control signal and
its derivative. Moreover, a fractional power-based auxiliary dynamic system is
introduced to compensate the error caused by the FFTCF estimation. Furthermore,
an improved fractional power-based adaptive law with the $\sigma $-modification
term is designed to attenuate the observer approximation error, such that the
tracking performance is further enhanced. In terms of the fast finite-time
stability theory, the signals of the closed-loop system are all fast
finite-time bounded while the attitude tracking errors can fast converge to a
sufficiently small region of the origin in finite time. Finally, a contrastive
numerical simulation is carried out to validate the effectiveness and
superiority of the designed control scheme.

by investigating HP transition of hyperbolic AdS black hole in extended

transition is composed of two HP transitions with a large and a small HP
temperature, and the triple point corresponds to small black holes/massless
black holes/large black holes (SBHs/MBHs/LBHs) phases all coexisting. We
present the two branches of HP transition temperatures, which both depend on
the pressure (i.e. the cosmological constant) and the Gauss-Bonnet constant.
Besides, the pressure and the Gauss-Bonnet constant both enlarge the large HP
temperature and diminish the small HP temperature. We also show the coexistence
lines in the $P-T$ phase diagrams. The triple point and an up critical point in
phase diagrams for arbitrary dimensional Gauss-Bonnet AdS black hole systems
are given, together with some interesting universal relations which only depend
on the dimensions of spacetime. We can explain the reentrant HP transition and
triple point of SBHs/MBHs/LBHs as the phase transition and triple point of
Hadronic matter/Quark-Gluon/Plasma/Quarkyonic matter in the QCD phase diagram.

resistant enough for heavy contamination. We propose extensions of the IPW/DR
estimators with density power weighting, which can eliminate the influence of
outliers almost completely. The outlier resistance of the proposed estimators
is evaluated through the unbiasedness of the estimating equations. Unlike the
median-based methods, our estimators are resistant to outliers even under heavy

bias correction to keep the double robustness even under the most tractable
form of contamination. In addition, the proposed estimators are found to be
highly resistant to outliers in more difficult settings where the contamination
ratio depends on the covariates. The outlier resistance of our estimators from
the viewpoint of the influence function is also favorable. Our theoretical
results are verified via Monte Carlo simulations and real data analysis. The

techniques from universal compression, the optimal prediction risk in
Kullback-Leibler divergence is shown to be $\Theta(\frac{k^2}{n}\log
\frac{n}{k^2})$, in contrast to the optimal rate of $\Theta(\frac{\log \log
n}{n})$ for $k=2$ previously shown in Falahatgar et al. (2016). These rates,
slower than the parametric rate of $O(\frac{k^2}{n})$, can be attributed to the
memory in the data, as the spectral gap of the Markov chain can be arbitrarily
small. To quantify the memory effect, we study irreducible reversible chains
with a prescribed spectral gap. In addition to characterizing the optimal
prediction risk for two states, we show that, as long as the spectral gap is
not excessively small, the prediction risk in the Markov model is
$O(\frac{k^2}{n})$, which coincides with that of an iid model with the same

address this issue by performing graph convolutions on spatial topologies, but
fixed graph structures and local perceptions limit their performances. To
tackle these problems, in this paper, different from previous approaches, we

Besides spatial objects, we also explore the graph relationships between
channels by reasonably aggregating channels to generate spectral descriptors.
The adjacent matrices in these graph convolutions are obtained by considering
the relationships among all descriptors to realize global perceptions. By
combining the extracted spatial and spectral graph features, we finally obtain
a spectral-spatial graph reasoning network (SSGRN). The spatial and spectral

this issue by constraining important parameters of old tasks from changing when
accepting new concepts, these approaches do not exploit common information of
each task which can be shared to existing neurons. As a result, they do not
scale well to large-scale problems since the parameter importance variables
quickly explode. An Inter-Task Synaptic Mapping (ISYANA) is proposed here to
underpin knowledge retention for continual learning. ISYANA combines
task-to-neuron relationship as well as concept-to-concept relationship such
that it prevents a neuron to embrace distinct concepts while merely accepting
relevant concept. Numerical study in the benchmark continual learning problems

radiation from the active galactic nucleus (AGN), distributed in the spatial
scale of AGN host galaxies. The strong emission lines from the NLR are useful
to diagnose physical and chemical properties of the interstellar medium in AGN
host galaxies. However, the origin of the NLR is unclear; the gas clouds in
NLRs may be originally in the host and photoionized by the AGN radiation, or
they may be transferred from the nucleus with AGN-driven outflows. For studying
the origin of the NLR, we systematically investigate the gas density and
velocity dispersion of NLR gas clouds using a large spectroscopic data set
taken from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The [S II] emission-line flux ratio
and [O III] velocity width of 9,571 type-2 Seyfert galaxies and 110,041
star-forming galaxies suggest that the gas density and velocity dispersion of
NLR clouds in Seyfert galaxies (ne ~ 194 cm-3 and sigma([O III]) ~ 147 km s-1)
are systematically larger than those of clouds in H II regions of star-forming
galaxies (ne ~ 29 cm-3 and sigma([O III]) ~ 58 km s-1). Interestingly, the
electron density and velocity dispersion of NLR gas clouds are larger for
Seyfert galaxies with a higher [O III]/Hbeta flux ratio, i.e., with a more
active AGN. We also investigate the spatially-resolved kinematics of ionized
gas clouds using the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at the Apache Point Observatory
(MaNGA) survey data for 90 Seyfert galaxies and 801 star-forming galaxies. We
find that the velocity dispersion of NLR gas clouds in Seyfert galaxies is
larger than that in star-forming galaxies at a fixed stellar mass, at both
central and off-central regions. These results suggest that gas clouds in NLRs
come from the nucleus, probably through AGN outflows.

demand for explanations from a variety of stakeholders. However, this demand is
ambiguous because there are many types of 'explanation' with different
evaluative criteria. In the spirit of pluralism, I chart a taxonomy of types of
explanation and the associated XAI methods that can address them. When we look
to expose the inner mechanisms of AI models, we develop
Diagnostic-explanations. When we seek to render model output understandable, we
produce Explication-explanations. When we wish to form stable generalizations
of our models, we produce Expectation-explanations. Finally, when we want to
justify the usage of a model, we produce Role-explanations that situate models
within their social context. The motivation for such a pluralistic view stems
from a consideration of causes as manipulable relationships and the different
types of explanations as identifying the relevant points in AI systems we can
intervene upon to affect our desired changes. This paper reduces the ambiguity
in use of the word 'explanation' in the field of XAI, allowing practitioners
and stakeholders a useful template for avoiding equivocation and evaluating XAI
methods and putative explanations.

increase diffusion, producing a contribution to wave attenuation comparable to
what is observed in the field and usually explained by viscous effects. The
resulting attenuation spectrum is characterized by a peak at the scale of the
inhomogeneities in the ice cover, which could explain the rollover of the
attenuation profile at small wavelengths observed in field experiments. The
proposed attenuation mechanism leads to the same behaviors that would be
produced by a viscous wave model with effective viscosity linearly dependent on
the ice thickness. This may explain recent findings that viscous wave models
require a thickness-dependent viscosity to fit experimental attenuation data.

The proposed approach employs two deep neural network architectures (U-Net and
Mask RCNN). First, we train the U-Net to generate synthetic CT images from the
corresponding FE simulations. This allows to generate large quantities of
annotated data without requiring costly manual annotations. This data is then
used to train the Mask R-CNN, which is focused on predicting contour points
around each of the yarns in the image. Experimental results show that our

HOM interference has shown femtosecond-level precision and great application
prospect in numerous fields depending on high-precision timefrequency signals.
Due to the difficulty of achieving stable HOM interference fringe after
long-distance fiber transmission, this quantum synchronization is hampered from
long-haul field application. Utilizing segmented fibers instead of a single
long-length fiber, we successfully achieved the stable observation of the
two-photon interference of the lab-developed broadband frequency-correlated
photon pairs after 20 km-long fiber transmission, without employing auxiliary
phase stabilization method. Referenced to this interference fringe, the balance
of the two fiber arms is successfully achieved with a long-term stability of 20
fs. The HOM-interference-based synchronization over a 20-km fiber link is thus
demonstrated and a minimum stability of 74 fs has been reached at 48,000 s.
This result not only provides a simple way to stabilize the fiber-optic
two-photon interferometer for long-distance quantum communication systems, but
also makes a great stride forward in extending the quantum-interference-based
synchronization scheme to the long-haul field applications.

nucleosynthesis, including variations of nature's fundamental constants, to
explore the problem and its possible solutions, in the context of the latest
observations and theoretical modeling. We quantify the amount of depletion
needed to solve the Lithium problem, and show that transport processes of
chemical elements in stars are able to account for it. Specifically, the
combination of atomic diffusion, rotation and penetrative convection allows us
to reproduce the lithium surface abundances of Population II stars, starting
from the primordial Lithium abundance. We also show that even with this
depletion factor there is a preference for a value of the fine-structure
constant at this epoch that is larger than the current laboratory one by a few
parts per million of relative variation, at the two to three standard
deviations level of statistical significance. This preference is driven by the
recently noticed discrepancy between the best-fit values for the
baryon-to-photon ratio (or equivalently the Deuterium abundance) inferred from
cosmic microwave background and primordial nucleosynthesis analyses, and is
largely insensitive to the Helium-4 abundance. We thus conclude that the
Lithium problem most likely has an astrophysical solution, while the Deuterium
discrepancy provides a possible hint of new physics.

measurement to a possible source. A cost functional is constructed so that the
optimal sensor trajectory maintains a high sensitivity and low temporal
variation in the measured signal, for a given source location. This naturally
leads to the adjoint-of-adjoint equation based on which the sensor trajectory
is iteratively optimized. It is shown that the estimation performance based on
the measurement obtained by a sensor moving along the optimal trajectory is
drastically improved from that achieved with a stationary sensor. It is also
shown that the ratio of the fluctuation and the mean of the sensitivity for a
given sensor trajectory can be used as a diagnostic tool to evaluate the
resultant performance. Based on this finding, we propose a new cost functional
which only includes the ratio without any adjustable parameters, and
demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting the time dependence of scalar
release from the source.

gain control over decisions in generic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems

modification, the attack mechanism we consider here involves alterations to the
AI system itself. Such a stealth attack could be conducted by a mischievous,
corrupt or disgruntled member of a software development team. It could also be
made by those wishing to exploit a ``democratization of AI'' agenda, where
network architectures and trained parameter sets are shared publicly. We
develop a range of new implementable attack strategies with accompanying
analysis, showing that with high probability a stealth attack can be made
transparent, in the sense that system performance is unchanged on a fixed
validation set which is unknown to the attacker, while evoking any desired
output on a trigger input of interest. The attacker only needs to have
estimates of the size of the validation set and the spread of the AI's relevant
latent space. In the case of deep learning neural networks, we show that a one
neuron attack is possible - a modification to the weights and bias associated
with a single neuron - revealing a vulnerability arising from
over-parameterization. We illustrate these concepts using state of the art

the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ are shown to be consistent with current

which is far below the observation limits. This result motivates us to explore
the smallness of $r$ in the general MAU. We propose a quintessential
generalization of the original model and prove $r<0.01$ in general. The null
detection to date of primordial gravitational waves provides a circumstantial
evidence for the MAU. After the end of inflation, the scalar field rolls toward
infinity instead of a local minimum, and meanwhile its equation of state is
oscillating with an average value larger than $1/3$. In this framework, we show
that gravitational particle creation at the end of inflation is capable of
reheating the Universe.

noteworthy that the PB-TADE turned out to be statistically significant compared

continuum images of both bands. CMM3A has an elliptical structure extending
along the direction almost perpendicular to the known outflow, while CMM3B
reveals a round shape. We have fitted two 2D-Gaussian components to the
elliptical structure of CMM3A and CMM3B, and have separated the disk and
envelope components for each source. The spectral index $\alpha$ between 2.0 mm

respectively, indicating the optically thick dust emission and/or the grain

CMM3A in the CH$_3$CN, CH$_3$OH, and $^{13}$CH$_3$OH lines detected in the 1.3
mm band, which can be interpreted as the rotation of the disk/envelope system.
From this result, the protostellar mass of CMM3A is roughly evaluated to be
$0.1- 0.5$ $M_\odot$ by assuming Keplerian rotation. The mass accretion rate is
thus estimated to be $5\times10^{-5}$ - 4 $\times$ $10^{-3}$ $M_\odot$

protostars. The OCS emission line shows a velocity gradient in both outflow
direction and disk/envelope direction. A hint of outflow rotation is found, and
the specific angular momentum of the outflow is estimated to be comparable to
that of the disk. These results provide us with novel information on the

This allows for an anomalous supercurrent to flow in the junction even in the

phase shift also manifests in the so-called Andreev interferometers - a device
that consists of a mesoscopic conductor coupled to the $\phi_0$-junction. Due
to the proximity effect, the resistance of this conductor is phase-sensitive -
it oscillates by varying the phase of the JJ. As a result, the quasiparticle

followed by a long training field (LTF) for channel estimation. To enable MIMO
channel estimation, the LTF is repeated as many times as the number of spatial
streams. For MU-MIMO, the CSI feedback in the 802.11ac/ax requires the access
point (AP) to send a null data packet (NDP) where the HT/VHT/HE LTF is repeated
as many times as the number of transmit antennas $N_{t}$. With each LTF being
4$\mu$s long in case of VHT and 12$\mu$s to 16$\mu$s long in case of High
Efficiency WLAN (HEW), the length of NDP grows linearly with increasing
$N_{t}$. Furthermore, the station (STA) with $N_{r}$ receive antennas needs to
expend significant processing power to compute SVD per tone for the
$N_{r}\times N_{t}$ channel matrix for generating the feedback bits, which
again increases linearly with $N_{t}\cdot N_{r}$. To reduce the training and
feedback overhead, this paper proposes a scheme based on Compressed Sensing
that allows only a subset of tones per LTF to be transmitted in NDP, which can
be used by STA to compute channel estimates that are then sent back without any
further processing. Since AP knows the measurement matrix, the full dimension
time domain channel estimates can be recovered by running the L1 minimization
algorithms (OMP, CoSAMP). AP can further process the time domain channel
estimates to generate the SVD precoding matrix.

superpositions of Gaussian states has recently been given a rigorous
mathematical foundation. [S. Bravyi and D. Gosset, Comm. Math. Phys. 356, 451
(2017)]. It is natural to ask how many parameters are required for an efficient
variational scheme based on this representation. An upper bound is $\mathcal
O(N^2)$, where $N$ is the system size, which corresponds to the number
parameters needed to specify an arbitrary Gaussian state. We provide an
alternative representation, with more favorable scaling, only requiring
$\mathcal O(N)$ parameters, that we illustrate for the interacting resonant
level model. We achieve the reduction by associating mean-field-like parent
Hamiltonians with the individual terms in the superposition, using physical
insight to retain only the most relevant channels in each parent Hamiltonian.
We benchmark our variational ansatz against the Numerical Renormalization
Group, and compare our results to existing variational schemes of a similar
nature to ours. Apart from the ground state energy, we also study the spectrum
of the correlation matrix -- a very stringent measure of accuracy. Our approach
outperforms some existing schemes and remains quantitatively accurate in the

As a result, the sequential recommender is prone to make inconsistent
predictions. In this paper, we propose a model, SSI, to improve sequential
recommendation consistency with Self-Supervised Imitation. Precisely, we
extract the consistency knowledge by utilizing three self-supervised
pre-training tasks, where temporal consistency and persona consistency capture
user-interaction dynamics in terms of the chronological order and persona
sensitivities, respectively. Furthermore, to provide the model with a global
perspective, global session consistency is introduced by maximizing the mutual
information among global and local interaction sequences. Finally, to
comprehensively take advantage of all three independent aspects of
consistency-enhanced knowledge, we establish an integrated imitation learning
framework. The consistency knowledge is effectively internalized and
transferred to the student model by imitating the conventional prediction logit
as well as the consistency-enhanced item representations. In addition, the
flexible self-supervised imitation framework can also benefit other student
recommenders. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that SSI effectively
outperforms the state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods.

critical to interconnect superconducting quantum processors over long

conversion scheme. Here, we propose a transduction scheme based on
continuous-variable quantum teleportation. Reliable quantum information
transmission can be realized with an arbitrarily small cooperativity, in
contrast to the direct conversion scheme which requires a large minimum
cooperativity. We show that the teleportation-based scheme maintains a
significant rate advantage robustly for all values of cooperativity. We further
investigate the performance in the transduction of complex quantum states such
as cat states and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill(GKP) states and show that a higher
fidelity or success probability can be achieved with the teleportation-based

quantum transduction between microwave and optical frequencies feasible in the

  Full Version",,,,,"cs.DB cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Efficient execution of SPARQL queries over large RDF datasets is a topic of
considerable interest due to increased use of RDF to encode data. Most of this
work has followed either relational or graph-based approaches. In this paper,
we propose an alternative query engine, called gSmart, based on matrix algebra.
This approach can potentially better exploit the computing power of
high-performance heterogeneous architectures that we target. gSmart
incorporates: (1) grouped incident edge-based SPARQL query evaluation, in which
all unevaluated edges of a vertex are evaluated together using a series of
matrix operations to fully utilize query constraints and narrow down the
solution space; (2) a graph query planner that determines the order in which
vertices in query graphs should be evaluated; (3) memory- and
computation-efficient data structures including the light-weight sparse matrix
(LSpM) storage for RDF data and the tree-based representation for evaluation
results; (4) a multi-stage data partitioner to map the incident edge-based
query evaluation into heterogeneous HPC architectures and develop multi-level
parallelism; and (5) a parallel executor that uses the fine-grained processing
scheme, pre-pruning technique, and tree-pruning technique to lower inter-node
communication and enable high throughput. Evaluations of gSmart on a CPU+GPU
HPC architecture show execution time speedups of up to 46920.00x compared to
the existing SPARQL query engines on a single node machine. Additionally,
gSmart on the Tianhe-1A supercomputer achieves a maximum speedup of 6.90x
scaling from 2 to 16 CPU+GPU nodes.

pedestrian connectivity and its relation to the intensity and mix of land-uses;
however, application within urban-design triggers a range of questions on
implementary specifics due to a variety of theories, methods, and
considerations and it is not immediately clear which of these might be the most
applicable at the pedestrian scale in relation to land-uses. It is,
furthermore, difficult to directly evaluate differing approaches on a
like-for-like basis without recourse to the underlying algorithms and
computational workflows. To this end, the cityseer-api Python package is here
used to develop, compute, and compare a range of centrality methods which are
then applied to the Ordnance Survey Open Roads dataset for Greater London. The
centralities are correlated to high-resolution land-use and mixed-used measures
computed from the Ordnance Survey Points of Interest dataset for the same
points of analysis using a spatially precise methodology based on network
distances to premise locations. The comparisons show that mixed-uses correlate
more strongly against closeness than betweenness centralities; segmented
measures tend to offer slightly stronger correlations than node-based
equivalents; weighted variants offer correlations similar to unweighted
versions, but with a greater degree of spatial specificity; simplest-path
methods confer an advantage in the context of local high-street mixed-uses but
not necessarily for district-wide mixed-uses or land-use accessibilities; and
the application of centrality measures to the dual network does not offer
tangible benefits over the primal network.

terms of cyclotomic divisibility of the mask polynomials $A(X)$ and $B(X)$

saturating spaces, developed through a combination of harmonic-analytic and

divisibility in terms of these concepts. As an application, we can determine
whether a set $A$ containing certain configuration can tile a cyclic group

We also develop tiling reductions where a given tiling can be replaced by one
or more tilings with a simpler structure. The tools introduced here are crucial

presented a $(p^{O(p)},7)$-bicriteria approximation for fair clustering with
$\ell_p$-norm cost: every point finds a center within distance at most $7$
times its distance to its $(n/k)$-th closest neighbor and the $\ell_p$-norm
cost of the solution is at most $p^{O(p)}$ times the cost of an optimal fair
solution.
  In this work, for any $\varepsilon>0$, we present an improved $(16^p

transportation and improvements to health. However, whereas mixed-use urbanism
is clearly beneficial, methods for measuring and assessing the presence of
mixed-uses at a granular level of analysis remain murkier. This work
demonstrates techniques for gauging mixed-uses in more spatially precise terms
concurring more readily with an urbanist's conception of pedestrian-accessible
mixed-uses. It does so through the use of the cityseer-api Python package,
which facilitates the use of spatially granular land-use classification data
assigned to adjacent street edges and then aggregated dynamically, with
distances measured from each point of analysis to each accessible land-use
while taking the direction of approach into account. It is argued that Hill
Numbers is a suitable measure of diversity because it can mirror the intent of
traditional indices while behaving more intuitively. Further, distance-weighted
formulations of Hill diversity can be applied with spatial impedances, thus
conferring a particularly spatially nuanced gauge of local access to
mixed-uses. These methods and indices are demonstrated for Greater London with
observations correlated to Principal Component Analysis derived from a range of
land-use accessibilities measured from the same locations and for the same

distance-weighted formulations, offer the most robust correlations for both
expansive mixed-use districts and more local 'high-street' mixes of uses while

network centrality methods, land-use accessibility and mixed-use measures, and
statistical aggregations. Accessibilities and aggregations are computed
dynamically over the street-network while taking walking distance thresholds
and the direction of approach into account, and can optionally incorporate
spatial impedances and network decomposition to increase spatial precision. The
use of Python facilitates compatibility with popular computational tools for
network manipulation (NetworkX), geospatial topology (shapely), geospatial data
state management (GeoPandas), and the NumPy stack of scientific packages. The
provision of robust network cleaning tools aids the use of OpenStreetMap data
for network analysis. Underlying loop-intensive algorithms are implemented in
Numba JIT compiled code so that the methods scale efficiently to larger cities

problem with many real-world applications. Previous works typically utilize
input-output examples as the specification for spreadsheet formula synthesis,
where each input-output pair simulates a separate row in the spreadsheet.
However, this formulation does not fully capture the rich context in real-world
spreadsheets. First, spreadsheet data entries are organized as tables, thus
rows and columns are not necessarily independent from each other. In addition,
many spreadsheet tables include headers, which provide high-level descriptions
of the cell data. However, previous synthesis approaches do not consider
headers as part of the specification. In this work, we present the first
approach for synthesizing spreadsheet formulas from tabular context, which
includes both headers and semi-structured tabular data. In particular, we
propose SpreadsheetCoder, a BERT-based model architecture to represent the
tabular context in both row-based and column-based formats. We train our model
on a large dataset of spreadsheets, and demonstrate that SpreadsheetCoder
achieves top-1 prediction accuracy of 42.51%, which is a considerable
improvement over baselines that do not employ rich tabular context. Compared to
the rule-based system, SpreadsheetCoder assists 82% more users in composing
formulas on Google Sheets.

intelligence to aid understanding and the search for promising designs. While
Gaussian processes (GP) stand out as easy-to-use and interpretable learners,
they have difficulties in accommodating big datasets, categorical inputs, and
multiple responses, which has become a common challenge for a growing number of
data-driven design applications. In this paper, we propose a GP model that
utilizes latent variables and functions obtained through variational inference
to address the aforementioned challenges simultaneously. The method is built
upon the latent variable Gaussian process (LVGP) model where categorical
factors are mapped into a continuous latent space to enable GP modeling of
mixed-variable datasets. By extending variational inference to LVGP models, the
large training dataset is replaced by a small set of inducing points to address
the scalability issue. Output response vectors are represented by a linear
combination of independent latent functions, forming a flexible kernel
structure to handle multiple responses that might have distinct behaviors.
Comparative studies demonstrate that the proposed method scales well for large
datasets with over 10^4 data points, while outperforming state-of-the-art
machine learning methods without requiring much hyperparameter tuning. In
addition, an interpretable latent space is obtained to draw insights into the
effect of categorical factors, such as those associated with building blocks of
architectures and element choices in metamaterial and materials design. Our
approach is demonstrated for machine learning of ternary oxide materials and
topology optimization of a multiscale compliant mechanism with aperiodic
microstructures and multiple materials.

of generating multi-step adversarial examples, we propose a Multi-stage
Optimization based Adversarial Training (MOAT) method that periodically trains
the model on mixed benign examples, single-step adversarial examples, and
multi-step adversarial examples stage by stage. In this way, the overall
training overhead is reduced significantly, meanwhile, the model could avoid

restoration of susceptibility-related (SuR) features in regions affected by
imperfect phase unwrapping, background suppression and low signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) due to phase dispersion. Theory and Methods: The predictable
components sampled across the echo dimension in a multi-echo GRE sequence are
recovered by rank minimizing a Hankel matrix formed using the complex
exponential of the background suppressed phase. To estimate the single
frequency component that relates to the susceptibility induced field, it is
required to maintain consistency with the measured phase after background
suppression, penalized by a unity rank approximation (URA) prior. This is
formulated as an optimization problem, implemented using the alternating
direction method of multiplier (ADMM). Results: With in vivo multi-echo GRE
data, the magnitude susceptibility weighted image (SWI) reconstructed using URA
prior shows additional venous structures that are obscured due to phase
dispersion and noise in regions subject to remnant non-local field variations.
The performance is compared with the susceptibility map weighted imaging (SMWI)
and the standard SWI. It is also shown using numerical simulation that
quantitative susceptibility map (QSM) computed from the reconstructed phase
exhibits reduced artifacts and quantification error. In vivo experiments reveal
iron depositions in insular, motor cortex and superior frontal gyrus that are
not identified in standard QSM. Conclusion: URA processed GRE phase is less
sensitive to imperfections in the phase pre-processing techniques, and thereby
enable robust estimation of SWI and QSM.

the channel combined phase at each echo time. For the purpose of maintaining
consistency with the observed complex data, the linear phase evolution model is
formulated as an optimization problem with a cost function that involves a
fidelity term and a unity rank prior, implemented using alternating

this linear phase evolution model is able to reduce the unwrapping errors as
compared to the unwrapping when directly applied to the measured phase.
Secondly, the improved accuracy of the frequency fit in comparison to
estimation using weighted least-square regression and penalized maximum
likelihood is demonstrated using numerical simulation of field perturbation due
to magnetic susceptibility effect. It is shown that the field can be estimated
with 80 percent reduction in mean absolute error in comparison to wLSR and 66
percent reduction with respect to penalized maximum likelihood. The improvement
in performance becomes more pronounced with increasing strengths of field

answered by reviewing a rich body of source material, including industry
literature, research journals, AI studies, market reports, market projections,
discussion papers, press releases, and organizations' websites. The paper
argues that continued innovation in pharmaceutical AI will enable rapid
development of safe and effective therapies for previously untreatable
diseases. A series of major points support this conclusion: The pharmaceutical
industry is in a significant productivity crisis today, and AI-enabled research
methods can be directly applied to reduce the time and cost of drug discovery
projects. The industry already reported results such as a 10-fold reduction in
drug molecule discovery times. Numerous AI alliances between industry,
governments, and academia enabled utilizing proprietary data and led to
outcomes such as the largest molecule toxicity database to date or more than
200 drug safety predictive models. The momentum was recently increased by the
involvement of tech giants combined with record rounds of funding. The
long-term effects will range from safer and more effective therapies, through
the diminished role of pharmaceutical patents, to large-scale collaboration and
new business strategies oriented around currently untreatable diseases. The
paper notes that while many reviewed resources seem to have overly optimistic
future expectations, even a fraction of these developments would alleviate the

circumstance. We find that the momentum of the particle must be a imaginary
number and it will be faster than light in a particular case. Then we discussed
a new way to define the simultaneity which is different from Einstein.

greenhouse gas enhancements (enh.) from imaging spectroscopy datasets. While
multiple algorithmic techniques and refinements have been proposed, the
greenhouse gas target spectrum used for concentration enh. estimation has
remained largely unaltered since the introduction of quantitative MF
retrievals. The magnitude of retrieved methane and carbon dioxide enh., and
thereby integrated mass enh. (IME) and estimated flux of point-source emitters,
is heavily dependent on this target spectrum. Current standard use of molecular
absorption coefficients to create unit enh. target spectra does not account for
absorption by background concentrations of greenhouse gases, solar and sensor
geometry, or atmospheric water vapor absorption. We introduce geometric and
atmospheric parameters into the generation of scene-specific (SS) unit enh.
spectra to provide target spectra that are compatible with all greenhouse gas
retrieval MF techniques. For methane plumes, IME resulting from use of
standard, generic enh. spectra varied from -22 to +28.7% compared to SS enh.
spectra. Due to differences in spectral shape between the generic and SS enh.
spectra, differences in methane plume IME were linked to surface spectral
characteristics in addition to geometric and atmospheric parameters. IME
differences for carbon dioxide plumes, with generic enh. spectra producing
integrated mass enh. -76.1 to -48.1% compared to SS enh. spectra. Fluxes
calculated from these integrated enh. would vary by the same %s, assuming
equivalent wind conditions. Methane and carbon dioxide IME were most sensitive
to changes in solar zenith angle and ground elevation. SS target spectra can
improve confidence in greenhouse gas retrievals and flux estimates across
collections of scenes with diverse geometric and atmospheric conditions.

their stuffle relations to obtain explicit evaluations of the sums
$R_n(p,t)=\sum\nolimits_{m=0}^n m^p H_m^t$, where $H_m$ are harmonic numbers.
When $t\le 4$ these sums were first studied by Spie\ss\ around 1990 and, more
recently, by Jin and Sun. Our key step first is to find an explicit formula of
a special type of the extended multiple harmonic sums. This also enables us to
provide a general structural result of the sums $R_n(p,t)$ for all $t\ge 0$.

  among radiologists and exploring its applications","29 pages, 3 tables, 7 figures",,,,"cs.HC cs.AI cs.DC cs.LG cs.NE cs.SI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Radiologists today play a key role in making diagnostic decisions and
labeling images for training A.I. algorithms. Low inter-reader reliability
(IRR) can be seen between experts when interpreting challenging cases. While
teams-based decisions are known to outperform individual decisions,
inter-personal biases often creep up in group interactions which limit
non-dominant participants from expressing true opinions. To overcome the dual
problems of low consensus and inter-personal bias, we explored a solution
modeled on biological swarms of bees. Two separate cohorts; three radiologists
and five radiology residents collaborated on a digital swarm platform in real
time and in a blinded fashion, grading meniscal lesions on knee MR exams. These
consensus votes were benchmarked against clinical (arthroscopy) and
radiological (senior-most radiologist) observations. The IRR of the consensus
votes was compared to the IRR of the majority and most confident votes of the
two cohorts.The radiologist cohort saw an improvement of 23% in IRR of swarm
votes over majority vote. Similar improvement of 23% in IRR in 3-resident swarm
votes over majority vote, was observed. The 5-resident swarm had an even higher
improvement of 32% in IRR over majority vote. Swarm consensus votes also
improved specificity by up to 50%. The swarm consensus votes outperformed
individual and majority vote decisions in both the radiologists and resident
cohorts. The 5-resident swarm had higher IRR than 3-resident swarm indicating
positive effect of increased swarm size. The attending and resident swarms also
outperformed predictions from a state-of-the-art A.I. algorithm. Utilizing a
digital swarm platform improved agreement and allows participants to express
judgement free intent, resulting in superior clinical performance and robust
A.I. training labels.

  mode decomposition","22 pages, 17 pages",,,,"cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.str-el cs.CE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Simulating the dynamics of a nonequilibrium quantum many-body system by
computing the two-time Green's function associated with such a system is
computationally challenging. However, we are often interested in the time
diagonal of such a Green's function or time dependent physical observables that
are functions of one time. In this paper, we discuss the possibility of using
dynamic model decomposition (DMD), a data-driven model order reduction
technique, to characterize one-time observables associated with the
nonequilibrium dynamics using snapshots computed within a small time window.
The DMD method allows us to efficiently predict long time dynamics from a
limited number of trajectory samples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DMD
on a model two-band system. We show that, in the equilibrium limit, the DMD
analysis yields results that are consistent with those produced from a linear
response analysis. In the nonequilibrium case, the extrapolated dynamics
produced by DMD is more accurate than a special Fourier extrapolation scheme
presented in this paper. We point out a potential pitfall of the standard DMD
method caused by insufficient spatial/momentum resolution of the discretization
scheme. We show how this problem can be overcome by using a variant of the DMD
method known as higher order DMD.
