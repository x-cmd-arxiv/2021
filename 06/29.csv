master equations describing the continuous dynamics of discrete variables in
random graphs. These equations constitute a hierarchical set of approximations
that generalize and improve the Cavity Master Equation (CME) recently obtained
in other publications. Our derivation clarifies some of the hypotheses and
approximations that originally lead to the CME, considered now as the first
order of a more general technique. We tested the new scheme in the dynamics of
three models defined over diluted graphs: the Ising ferromagnet, the Viana-Bray
spin-glass and the susceptible-infectious-susceptible model for epidemics. In
the first two, the new equations perform similarly to the best-known approaches
in the literature. In the latter, they outperform the well-known Pair Quenched
Mean-Field Approximation.

performance measurement. The risk contribution of a portfolio, e.g., in the
Euler or Aumann-Shapley framework, is given by the partial derivatives of a
risk measure applied to the portfolio profit and loss in direction of the asset
units. For risk measures that are not positively homogeneous of degree 1,
however, known capital allocation principles do not apply. We study the class
of lambda quantile risk measures that includes the well-known Value-at-Risk as
a special case but for which no known allocation rule is applicable. We prove
differentiability and derive explicit formulae of the derivatives of lambda
quantiles with respect to their portfolio composition, that is their risk
contribution. For this purpose, we define lambda quantiles on the space of
portfolio compositions and consider generic (also non-linear) portfolio
operators.
  We further derive the Euler decomposition of lambda quantiles for generic
portfolios and show that lambda quantiles are homogeneous in the space of
portfolio compositions, with a homogeneity degree that depends on the portfolio
composition and the lambda function. This result is in stark contrast to the
positive homogeneity properties of risk measures defined on the space of random
variables which admit a constant homogeneity degree. We introduce a generalised
version of Euler contributions and Euler allocation rule, which are compatible
with risk measures of any homogeneity degree and non-linear but homogeneous
portfolios. These concepts are illustrated by a non-linear portfolio using
financial market data.

algorithms, which directly impact their overall performance. As such, using a
well-structured dataset that has minimum level of bias is always desirable. In
this paper, we proposed a novel, domain-independent approach, called
score-based resampling (SBR), to locate the under-represented samples of the
original training dataset based on the model prediction scores obtained with
that training set. In our method, once trained, we use the same CNN model to
infer on its own training samples, obtain prediction scores, and based on the
distance between predicted and ground-truth, we identify samples that are far
away from their ground-truth and augment them in the original training set. The
temperature term of the Sigmoid function is decreased to better differentiate
scores. For experimental evaluation, we selected one Kaggle dataset for gender
classification. We first used a CNN-based classifier with relatively standard
structure, trained on the training images, and evaluated on the provided
validation samples of the original dataset. Then, we assessed it on a totally
new test dataset consisting of light male, light female, dark male, and dark
female groups. The obtained accuracies varied, revealing the existence of
categorical bias against certain groups in the original dataset. Subsequently,
we trained the model after resampling based on our proposed approach. We
compared our method with a previously proposed variational autoencoder (VAE)
based algorithm. The obtained results confirmed the validity of our proposed
method regrading identifying under-represented samples among original dataset
to decrease categorical bias of classifying certain groups. Although tested for
gender classification, the proposed algorithm can be used for investigating

and has many real-world applications. An episode is a partially ordered set of
objects (e.g., item, node), and each object is associated with an event type.
This episode can also be considered as a complex event sub-sequence.
High-utility episode mining is an interesting utility-driven mining task in the
real world. Traditional episode mining algorithms, by setting a threshold,
usually return a huge episode that is neither intuitive nor saves time. In
general, finding a suitable threshold in a pattern-mining algorithm is a
trivial and time-consuming task. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm,
called Top-K High Utility Episode (THUE) mining within the complex event
sequence, which redefines the previous mining task by obtaining the K highest
episodes. We introduce several threshold-raising strategies and optimize the
episode-weighted utilization upper bounds to speed up the mining process and
effectively reduce the memory cost. Finally, the experimental results on both
real-life and synthetic datasets reveal that the THUE algorithm can offer six
to eight orders of magnitude running time performance improvement over the
state-of-the-art algorithm and has low memory consumption.

discretized by a polynomial B-spline collocation method. For an arbitrary
polynomial degree $p$, we show that the resulting coefficient matrices possess
a Toeplitz-like structure. We investigate their spectral properties via their
symbol and we prove that, like for second order differential problems, also in
this case the given matrices are ill-conditioned both in the low and high
frequencies for large $p$. More precisely, in the fractional scenario the
symbol has a single zero at $0$ of order $\alpha$, with $\alpha$ the fractional
derivative order that ranges from $1$ to $2$, and it presents an exponential
decay to zero at $\pi$ for increasing $p$ that becomes faster as $\alpha$
approaches $1$. This translates in a mitigated conditioning in the low
frequencies and in a deterioration in the high frequencies when compared to
second order problems. Furthermore, the derivation of the symbol reveals
another similarity of our problem with a classical diffusion problem. Since the
entries of the coefficient matrices are defined as evaluations of fractional
derivatives of the B-spline basis at the collocation points, we are able to
express the central entries of the coefficient matrix as inner products of two
fractional derivatives of cardinal B-splines. Finally, we perform a numerical
study of the approximation behavior of polynomial B-spline collocation. This
study suggests that, in line with non-fractional diffusion problems, the
approximation order for smooth solutions in the fractional case is $p+2-\alpha$
for even $p$, and $p+1-\alpha$ for odd $p$.

intelligence. It is often inefficient to conduct reasoning and inference
directly in the space of raw sensory representations, such as pixel values of
images. Representation learning allows us to automatically discover suitable
representations from raw sensory data. For example, given raw sensory data, a
deep neural network learns nonlinear representations at its hidden layers,
which are subsequently used for classification (or regression) at its output
layer. This happens implicitly during training through minimizing a supervised
or unsupervised loss in common practical regimes of deep learning, unlike the
neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime. In this paper, we study the dynamics of
such implicit nonlinear representation learning, which is beyond the NTK
regime. We identify a pair of a new assumption and a novel condition, called
the common model structure assumption and the data-architecture alignment
condition. Under the common model structure assumption, the data-architecture
alignment condition is shown to be sufficient for the global convergence and
necessary for the global optimality. Moreover, our theory explains how and when
increasing the network size does and does not improve the training behaviors in
the practical regime. Our results provide practical guidance for designing a
model structure: e.g., the common model structure assumption can be used as a
justification for using a particular model structure instead of others. We also
derive a new training framework based on the theory. The proposed framework is
empirically shown to maintain competitive (practical) test performances while
providing global convergence guarantees for deep residual neural networks with
convolutions, skip connections, and batch normalization with standard benchmark
datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN.

introduces the challenge of having enough data to support learning of their
predictive models. Many prior works have addressed this problem by first
building a general patient-state representation model, and then adapting it to
a new low-prior prediction target. In this schema, there is potential for the
predictive performance to be hindered by the misalignment between the general
patient-state model and the target task. To overcome this challenge, we propose
a new method that simultaneously optimizes a shared model through multi-task
learning of both the low-prior supervised target and general purpose
patient-state representation (GPSR). More specifically, our method improves
prediction performance of a low-prior task by jointly optimizing a shared model
that combines the loss of the target event and a broad range of generic
clinical events. We study the approach in the context of Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNNs). Through extensive experiments on multiple clinical event
targets using MIMIC-III data, we show that the inclusion of general
patient-state representation tasks during model training improves the
prediction of individual low-prior targets.

management paradigms, namely: cost, increased downtime, less-than-optimal
safety management paradigm and the limited applicability of fully-autonomous
operations. In the context of SHM, one of the most challenging tasks is damage
quantification. Current methods face accuracy and/or robustness issues when it
comes to varying operating and environmental conditions. In addition, the
damage/no-damage paradigm of current frameworks does not offer much information
to maintainers on the ground for proper decision-making. In this study, a novel
structural damage quantification framework is proposed based on widely-used
Damage Indices (DIs) and Gaussian Process Regression Models (GPRMs). The
novelty lies in calculating the probability of an incoming test DI point
originating from a specific state, which allows for probability-educated
decision-making. This framework is applied to three test cases: a Carbon
Fiber-Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) coupon with attached weights as simulated
damage, an aluminum coupon with a notch, and an aluminum coupon with attached
weights as simulated damage under varying loading states. The state prediction
method presented herein is applied to single-state quantification in the first
two test cases, as well as the third one assuming the loading state is known.
Finally, the proposed method is applied to the third test case assuming neither
the damage size nor the load is known in order to predict both simultaneously
from incoming DI test points. In applying this framework, two forms of GPRMs
(standard and variational heteroscedastic) are used in order to critically
assess their performances with respect to the three test cases.

insufficient incident light coming through the relatively small aperture,
resulting in a low signal-to-noise ratio. Most of the previous works on
low-light image processing focus either only on a single task such as
illumination adjustment, color enhancement, or noise removal; or on a joint
illumination adjustment and denoising task that heavily relies on short-long
exposure image pairs collected from specific camera models, and thus these
approaches are less practical and generalizable in real-world settings where
camera-specific joint enhancement and restoration is required. To tackle this
problem, in this paper, we propose a low-light image processing framework that
performs joint illumination adjustment, color enhancement, and denoising.
Considering the difficulty in model-specific data collection and the ultra-high
definition of the captured images, we design two branches: a coefficient
estimation branch as well as a joint enhancement and denoising branch. The
coefficient estimation branch works in a low-resolution space and predicts the
coefficients for enhancement via bilateral learning, whereas the joint
enhancement and denoising branch works in a full-resolution space and
progressively performs joint enhancement and denoising. In contrast to existing
methods, our framework does not need to recollect massive data when being
adapted to another camera model, which significantly reduces the efforts
required to fine-tune our approach for practical usage. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate its great potential in real-world low-light imaging
applications when compared with current state-of-the-art methods.

plasma processing applications. Capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) discharges
excited using non-sinusoidal waveform have shown its capability to control IEDF
through generation of DC self-bias. In this paper, we performed a
particle-in-cell simulation study to investigate the IEDF in a symmetric
capacitive discharge excited by saw-tooth like current waveform at a very high
frequency (VHF). At a constant driving frequency of 27.12 MHz, the simulation
results predict that the ion energy symmetry scales with the discharge current
amplitude and the IEDF turn into a bi-modal distribution at higher current
density amplitude. Further studies at a constant current density and varying
the fundamental excitation frequency, shows that the ion energy asymmetry is
greatly reduced with a reduction in the driving frequency. Increase in the
plasma asymmetry and significant DC self-bias at lower driving frequency is
observed to be one of the principal factors responsible for the observed
asymmetry in the ion energy peaks. An investigation of DC self-bias and plasma
potential confirm that the powered electrode energy peak corresponds to the DC
self-bias with respect to the plasma potential, and the grounded electrode peak
corresponds to the plasma potential. These results suggest that although lower
frequency is good for generating the asymmetry and DC self-bias in the
discharge, but a narrow low energy IEDF is only possible in very high frequency
driven CCP systems.

depends on solar and planetary energy. As a star ages, it delivers more energy
to a planet. As a planet ages it produces less internal heat, which leads to
cooling. For the Earth, interior cooling connects to plate tectonics - the
surface manifestation of convection within the Earth's interior. This process
cycles volatiles (CO2 and water) between surface and interior reservoirs, which
affects planetary climate. Cycling rates depend on the efficiency of plate
tectonic cooling. That efficiency remains debated and multiple hypotheses have
been put forth. Geological proxy data allow us to validate these hypotheses
accounting for model and data uncertainty. Multiple models pass the validation
test. Those models define a distribution for terrestrial exoplanets akin to
Earth, accounting for variations in tectonic efficiency. Feeding this
distribution into climate models indicates that the time at which habitable
conditions are established can vary by billions of years. Planets of the same
absolute age and orbital distance can reside and not reside within the classic
habitable zone due to differences in plate tectonic cooling efficiencies. The
full model population allows a probability distribution to be constructed for
the the time at which habitable conditions are established. The distribution
indicates that Earth-like exoplanets, of the same age, can be at different
evolutionary stages. It also indicates that planets around stars whose early
evolution is unfavorable for life can become habitable later in their energetic
histories.

the onset of chaos is determined by the overlap of two-body mean motion
resonances (MMRs), like it is in two-planet systems; (ii) secular evolution
causes the MMR widths to expand and contract adiabatically, so that the chaotic
boundary is established where MMRs overlap at their greatest width. For closely
spaced two-planet systems, a near-symmetry strongly suppresses this secular
modulation, explaining why the chaotic boundaries for two-planet systems are
qualitatively different from cases with more than two planets. We use these
results to derive an improved angular-momentum-deficit (AMD) stability
criterion, i.e., the critical system AMD below which stability should be
guaranteed. This introduces an additional factor to the expression from Laskar

corrects the AMD threshold toward lower eccentricities by a factor of several
for tightly packed configurations. We make routines for evaluating the chaotic

results are compared with the numerical solution of the linearised Boltzmann

solve a wide variety of tasks. If tasks depend on each other (e.g. needing to
learn to walk before learning to run), curriculum learning can speed up
learning by focusing on the next best task to learn. We explore curriculum
learning in a complex, visual domain with many hard exploration challenges:
Minecraft. We find that learning progress (defined as a change in success
probability of a task) is a reliable measure of learnability for automatically
constructing an effective curriculum. We introduce a learning-progress based
curriculum and test it on a complex reinforcement learning problem (called
""Simon Says"") where an agent is instructed to obtain a desired goal item. Many
of the required skills depend on each other. Experiments demonstrate that: (1)
a within-episode exploration bonus for obtaining new items improves
performance, (2) dynamically adjusting this bonus across training such that it
only applies to items the agent cannot reliably obtain yet further increases
performance, (3) the learning-progress based curriculum elegantly follows the
learning curve of the agent, and (4) when the learning-progress based
curriculum is combined with the dynamic exploration bonus it learns much more
efficiently and obtains far higher performance than uniform baselines. These
results suggest that combining intra-episode and across-training exploration

In many cases, a loop cannot be linked to an individual thin strand in the

this complexity can form impressions of thin bright loops, even in the absence

observations whether a particular loop corresponds to a strand in the volume,
or a projection artifact. We demonstrate how apparently isolated loops could
deceive observers, even when observations from multiple viewing angles are

additional insight into the beam response. Our study builds on previous work on

particular, they are sensitive to the choice of optimizer (AdamW vs. SGD),
optimizer hyperparameters, and training schedule length. In comparison, modern
convolutional neural networks are easier to optimize. Why is this the case? In
this work, we conjecture that the issue lies with the patchify stem of ViT
models, which is implemented by a stride-p p*p convolution (p=16 by default)
applied to the input image. This large-kernel plus large-stride convolution
runs counter to typical design choices of convolutional layers in neural
networks. To test whether this atypical design choice causes an issue, we
analyze the optimization behavior of ViT models with their original patchify
stem versus a simple counterpart where we replace the ViT stem by a small
number of stacked stride-two 3*3 convolutions. While the vast majority of
computation in the two ViT designs is identical, we find that this small change
in early visual processing results in markedly different training behavior in
terms of the sensitivity to optimization settings as well as the final model
accuracy. Using a convolutional stem in ViT dramatically increases optimization
stability and also improves peak performance (by ~1-2% top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet-1k), while maintaining flops and runtime. The improvement can be
observed across the wide spectrum of model complexities (from 1G to 36G flops)
and dataset scales (from ImageNet-1k to ImageNet-21k). These findings lead us
to recommend using a standard, lightweight convolutional stem for ViT models in
this regime as a more robust architectural choice compared to the original ViT
model design.

recent years, inspired by the great success achieved by Transformer in NLP

have achieved promising performance in computer vision tasks compared with
their CNN counterparts. More recently, researchers investigate using the
pure-MLP architecture to build the vision backbone to further reduce the
inductive bias, achieving good performance. The pure-MLP backbone is built upon
channel-mixing MLPs to fuse the channels and token-mixing MLPs for
communications between patches. In this paper, we re-think the design of the
token-mixing MLP. We discover that token-mixing MLPs in existing MLP-based
backbones are spatial-specific, and thus it is sensitive to spatial

token-mixing MLPs limits their capability in mixing tokens. To overcome those

cluster population. We detect clusters from high resolution, $UBR$ optical
observations from HST, and compare their luminosities and colors with stellar
population models to estimate the ages and masses of the clusters. No clusters
younger than $\sim$70 Myr are found, indicating star formation shut off at this
time. Clusters formed $\sim$120 Myr ago reach masses up to $\sim
\mbox{few}\times10^7~M_{\odot}$, several times higher than similar age
counterparts formed in actively merging galaxies like the Antennae and NGC
3256. We develop a new calibration based on known properties for 8 nearby
galaxies to estimate the star formation rate (SFR) of a galaxy from the mass of
the most massive cluster, $M_{\rm max}$. The cluster population indicates that
S12 experienced an extremely intense but short-lived burst $\sim$120 Myr ago,
with an estimated peak of $500^{+500}_{-250}~M_{\odot}~\mbox{yr}^{-1}$ and
duration of $50\pm25$ Myr, one of the highest SFRs estimated for any galaxy in
the nearby universe. Prior to the recent, intense burst, S12 was forming stars
at a moderate rate of $\sim 3{-}5~M_{\odot}~\mbox{yr}^{-1}$, typical of spiral
galaxies. However, the system also experienced an earlier burst approximately
$1{-}3$ Gyr ago. While fairly uncertain, we estimate that the SFR during this
earlier burst was $\sim20{-}30~M_{\odot}~\mbox{yr}^{-1}$, similar to the
current SFR in the Antennae and NGC 3256.

Furthermore, the results of our functional task suggest an important difference
between human-human and human-robot interaction in the absence of overt

the circumgalactic medium (CGM), creating an overall cooler CGM than that of
similar galaxy simulations run without cosmic rays. We generate synthetic
sightlines of the simulated galaxies' CGM and use Voigt profile fitting methods
to extract ion column densities, Doppler-b parameters, and velocity centroids
of individual absorbers. We directly compare these synthetic spectral line fits
with HST/COS CGM absorption-line data analyses, which tend to show that
metallic species with a wide range of ionization potential energies are often
kinematically aligned. Compared to the Milky-Way simulation run without cosmic
rays, the presence of cosmic-ray pressure in the inner CGM creates narrower OVI
absorption features and broader SiIII absorption features, a quality which is
more consistent with observational data. Additionally, because the cool gas is
buoyant due to nonthermal cosmic-ray pressure support, the velocity centroids
of both cool and warm gas tend to align in the simulated Milky Way with
feedback from cosmic rays. Our study demonstrates that detailed, direct
comparisons between simulations and observations, focused on gas kinematics,
have the potential to reveal the dominant physical mechanisms that shape the
CGM.

we recover the known brown dwarf HR 2562 B using a vAPP coronagraph, in
conjunction with the Magellan Adaptive Optics (MagAO) system, at a
signal-to-noise of S/N = 3.04 in the lesser studied L-band regime. The data

three different processing techniques to extract the companion, including
Flipped Differential Imaging (FDI), a newly devised Principal Component

SPHERE observations, our atmospheric modelling indicates a spectral type at the
L/T transition with mass M = 29$\pm$15 M$_{\text{Jup}}$, consistent with
literature results. However, effective temperature and surface gravity vary
significantly depending on the wavebands considered
(1200$\leq$T$_{\text{eff}}$(K)$\leq$1700 and 4.0$\leq$log(g)(dex)$\leq$5.0),
reflecting the challenges of modelling objects at the L/T transition.
Observations between 2.4-3.2 $\mu$m will be more effective in distinguishing
cooler brown dwarfs due to the onset of absorption bands in this region. We
explain that instrumental scattered light and wind-driven halo can be
detrimental to FDI+PCA and thus must be sufficiently mitigated to use this
processing technique. We thus demonstrate the potential of vAPP coronagraphs in
the characterisation of high-contrast substellar companions, even in
sub-optimal conditions, and provide new, complementary photometry of HR 2562 B.

leads to a breakdown of thermalization upon unitary evolution starting from a
large class of simple initial states. Despite the non-integrable nature of the
Hamiltonian, many of its high-energy eigenstates admit a quasiparticle
description. A class of these, which we dub as ""bubble eigenstates"", have
integer eigenvalues (including mid-spectrum zero modes) and strictly localized
quasiparticles while another class contains mobile quasiparticles leading to a
dispersion in momentum space. Other anomalous eigenstates that arise due to a
{\it secondary} fragmentation mechanism, including those that lead to flat
bands in momentum space due to destructive quantum interference, are also
discussed. The consequences of adding a (non-commuting) staggered magnetic
field and a PXP term respectively to this model, where the former preserves the
Hilbert space fragmentation while the latter destroys it, are discussed. A
Floquet version with time-dependent staggered field also evades thermalization
with additional features like freezing of exponentially many states at special
drive frequencies. Finally, we map the model to a $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory
coupled to dynamical fermions and discuss the interpretation of some of these
anomalous states in this language. A class of gauge-invariant states show
reduced mobility of the elementary charged excitations with only certain
charge-neutral objects being mobile suggesting a connection to fractons.

recently studied by the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method. Such a doped hole
behaves like a ""twisted"" non-Landau quasiparticle characterized by an emergent
quantum number in agreement with exact numerics. In this work, we further
investigate the ground state of two holes by VMC. It is found that the two
holes strongly attract each other to form a pairing state with a new quantum
number the same as obtained by the numerical exact diagonalization and density
matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations. A unique feature of this
pairing state is a dichotomy in the pairing symmetry, i.e., a d-wave in terms
of the electron c operators and an s-wave in terms of the new quasiparticles,
as explicitly illustrated in the ground state wave function. A similar VMC
study of a two-hole wave function for the t-J two-leg ladder also yields a good
agreement with the DMRG result. We demonstrate that the pairing mechanism
responsible for the strong binding here is not due to the long-range
antiferromagnetic order nor the resonating-valence-bound pairing in the spin
background but is the consequence of the quantum phase-strings created by the
hopping of holes. The resulting spin-current pattern mediating the pairing
force is explicitly illustrated in the VMC calculation. Physical implications
to superconductivity at finite doping are also discussed.

small $U$ due to charge transfers between the Dirac and flat bands. At strong
$U$ where the bandwidths exceed interactions, all the fillings $\nu$ enter a
metal phase with small or zero valley polarization and intervalley coherence.

computation and storage, while the other for auxiliary operations like runtime
qubit detection, sympathetic cooling, and repetitive entanglement generation
through photon links. Dual-type qubits have previously been realized in hybrid
systems using two ion species, which, however, introduces significant
experimental challenges for laser setup, gate operations as well as the control
of the fraction and positioning of each qubit type within an ion crystal. Here
we solve these problems by implementing two coherently-convertible qubit types
using the same ion species. We encode the qubits into two pairs of clock states
of the 171Yb+ ions, and achieve fast and high-fidelity conversion between the
two types using narrow-band lasers. We further demonstrate that operations on
one qubit type, including sympathetic laser cooling, gates and qubit detection,
have crosstalk errors less than 0.03% on the other type, well below the error
threshold for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Our work showcases the
feasibility and advantages of using coherently convertible dual-type qubits

O8.5Ib-II(f)p star, LM Vel. The X-ray light curve shows a very low level of
emission, punctuated by a single, faint flare. Analysis of spectra measured
during the flare and during quiescence is performed. The quiescent state shows
a continuum spectrum well deconvolved to three spectral models: two components
are from a collisionally-ionized plasma (with temperatures kT1=0.24 keV and
kT2=0.76 keV), together with a power law model (photon index of 2.55),
dominating above 2 keV. The X-ray flux emitted at this lowest level is
3.2$\times10^{-13}$ erg/cm2/s (0.5-10 keV, corrected for the interstellar
absorption), implying an X-ray luminosity of 1.85$\times10^{32}$ erg/s (at 2.2
kpc). The two temperature collisionally-ionized plasma is intrinsic to the
stellar wind of the donor star, while the power law can be interpreted as
emission due to residual, low level accretion onto the compact object. The
X-ray luminosity contributed by the power law component only, in the lowest
state, is (4.8$\pm{1.4})\times10^{31}$ erg/s, the lowest quiescent luminosity
detected from the compact object in an SFXT. Thanks to this very faint X-ray
state caught by XMM-Newton, X-ray emission from the wind of the donor star LM
Vel could be well-established and studied in detail for the first time, as well
as a very low level of accretion onto the compact object. The residual
accretion rate onto the compact object in IGR J08408-4503 can be interpreted as
the Bohm diffusion of (possibly magnetized) plasma entering the neutron star
magnetosphere at low Bondi capture rates from the supergiant donor wind at the
quasi-spherical radiation-driven settling accretion stage.

cancellation mechanism is a necessary condition for liftability. In addition,
the anomaly cancellation and the CS couplings in six and five dimensions
respectively determine the central charges of string-like BPS objects that
cannot be consistently decoupled from gravity, a.k.a. supergravity strings.
Following the completeness conjecture and requiring that their worldsheet
theory is unitary imposes bounds on the admissible theories. We argue that for
the anomaly-free six-dimensional theories it is more advantageous to study the
unitarity constraints obtained after reduction to five dimensions. In general
these are slightly more stringent and can be cast in a more geometric form,
highly reminiscent of the Kodaira positivity condition (KPC). Indeed, for the
F-theoretic models which have an underlying Calabi-Yau threefold these can be
directly compared. The unitarity constraints (UC) are in general weaker than
KPC, and maybe useful in understanding the consistent models without
F-theoretic realisation. We catalogue the cases when UC is more restrictive
than KPC, hinting at more refined hidden structure in elliptic Calabi-Yau
threefolds with certain singularity structure.

realizing a novel non-Hermitian topological phase which we call a
\emph{hybrid-PT topological phases}. Interestingly, while the bulk spectrum is
still fully real, we find that exceptional Fermi-rings (EFRs) appear connecting
the two Dirac nodes on the surface. This provides a route to probe and utilize
both the bulk Dirac physics and exceptional rings/points on equal footing.
Moreover, particularly for $\mathcal{T}$-NHHODSMs, we also find real hinge-arcs
connecting the surface EFRs. We show that this higher-order topology can be
characterized using a biorthogonal real-space formula of the quadrupole moment.
Furthermore, by applying Hermitian $C_4$-symmetric perturbations, we discover
various novel phases, particularly: (i) an intrinsic $\mathcal{I}$-NHHODSM

as semantic segmentation. Specifically, uneven class distributions in a
training dataset often result in unsatisfactory performance on
under-represented classes. Many works have proposed to weight the standard
cross entropy loss function with pre-computed weights based on class
statistics, such as the number of samples and class margins. There are two
major drawbacks to these methods: 1) constantly up-weighting minority classes
can introduce excessive false positives in semantic segmentation; 2) a minority
class is not necessarily a hard class. The consequence is low precision due to
excessive false positives. In this regard, we propose a hard-class mining loss
by reshaping the vanilla cross entropy loss such that it weights the loss for
each class dynamically based on instantaneous recall performance. We show that
the novel recall loss changes gradually between the standard cross entropy loss
and the inverse frequency weighted loss. Recall loss also leads to improved
mean accuracy while offering competitive mean Intersection over Union (IoU)
performance. On Synthia dataset, recall loss achieves $9\%$ relative
improvement on mean accuracy with competitive mean IoU using DeepLab-ResNet18

this utility by addressing two problems in the perturbative regime: Dynamical
Casimir Effect and gravitational wave resonance. We reproduce many previous

radius ($r_{e}$) has been well-studied using wide spectroscopic surveys.
However, these surveys suffer from severe surface brightness incompleteness in
the dwarf galaxy regime, where the relation is poorly constrained. In this
study, I use a Bayesian empirical model to constrain the power-law exponent
$\beta$ of the $M_{*}$-$r_{e}$ relation for late-type dwarfs
($10^{7}$$\leq$$M_{*}$/$M_{\odot}$$\leq$$10^{9}$) using a sample of 188
isolated low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies, accounting for observational
incompleteness. Surprisingly, the best-fitting model ($\beta$=0.40$\pm$0.07)
indicates that the relation is significantly steeper than would be expected
from extrapolating canonical models into the dwarf galaxy regime. Nevertheless,
the best fitting $M_{*}$-$r_{e}$ relation closely follows the distribution of
known dwarf galaxies. These results indicate that extrapolated canonical models
over-predict the number of large dwarf (i.e. LSB) galaxies, including
ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), explaining why they are over-produced by some
semi-analytic models. The best-fitting model also constrains the power-law
exponent of the physical size distribution of UDGs to
$n\mathrm{[dex^{-1}]}\propto$$~r_{e}^{3.54\pm0.33}$, consistent to within
1$\sigma$ of the corresponding value in cluster environments and with the
theoretical scenario in which UDGs occupy the high-spin tail of the normal
dwarf galaxy population.

produced by the variation of the gauge couplings are practically unaffected by
the relative strength of the parity-breaking terms. A new method is proposed
for the estimate of the gauge power spectra in the presence of pseudoscalar
interactions during inflation. To corroborate the general results, various
concrete examples are explicitly analyzed. Since the large-scale gauge spectra
also determine the late-time magnetic fields it turns out that the pseudoscalar
contributions have little impact on the magnetogenesis requirement. Conversely
the parity-breaking terms crucially affect the gyrotropic spectra that may
seed, in certain models, the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. In the most
interesting regions of the parameter space the modes reentering prior to
symmetry breaking lead to a sufficiently large baryon asymmetry while the
magnetic power spectra associated with the modes reentering after symmetry
breaking may even be of the order of a few hundredths of a nG over typical
length scales comparable with the Mpc prior to the collapse of the protogalaxy.
From the viewpoint of the effective field theory description of magnetogenesis
scenarios these considerations hold generically for the whole class of
inflationary models where the inflaton is not constrained by any underlying

magnetic islands and achieve other desired physics properties at the same time.
For many physics quantities that have been used in stellarator optimization,
including quasisymmetry, neoclassical transport, and magnetohydrodynamic
stability, it is convenient to use a magnetic equilibrium representation that
assures the existence of magnetic surfaces. However, this representation hides
the possible presence of magnetic islands, which are typically undesirable. To
include both surface-based objectives and island widths in a single
optimization, two fixed-boundary equilibrium calculations are run at each
iteration of the optimization: one that enforces the existence of magnetic
surfaces (VMEC [S. P. Hirshman and J. C. Whitson, Phys. Fluids 26, 3553
(1983)]), and one that does not (SPEC [S. R. Hudson, et al, Phys. Plasmas 19,
112502 (2012)]). By penalizing the island residues in the objective function,
the two magnetic field representations are brought into agreement during the
optimization. An example is presented in which, particularly on the surface
where quasisymmetry was targeted, quasisymmetry is achieved more accurately
than in previously published examples.

a viable route for the development of innovative quantum technologies. In this
context, the development of rational design strategies to controllably tune the
interaction between magnetic moments is crucial. In the metallic regime, the
indirect interaction mediated by conduction electrons, the so-called RKKY
coupling, has been proven to be remarkably fertile in creating and controlling
magnetic phenomena. However, despite its potential, the possibility of using
superconductivity to control the sign and the strength of indirect interactions
between magnet moments remains largely unexplored. Here we address this problem
at its ultimate limit, demonstrating the possibility of maximally tuning the
interaction between local spins coupled through a superconducting condensate
with atomic scale precision. By using Cr atoms coupled to superconducting Nb as
a prototypical system, we use atomic manipulation techniques to precisely
control the relative distance between local spins along different
crystallographic directions while simultaneously sensing their coupling by
scanning tunneling spectroscopy. Our results reveal the existence of highly
anisotropic superconductor-mediated indirect couplings between the local spins,
lasting up to very long distances, up to 12 times the lattice constant of Nb.
Moreover, we demonstrate the possibility of controllably crossing a quantum
phase transition by acting on the direction and interatomic distance between
spins. The extremely high tunability provides novel opportunities for the
realization of exotic phenomena such as topological superconductivity and the
rational design of magneto-superconducting interfaces.

consider the problem of designing data structures that maintain the

deletion of sites. For unit disk graphs we describe a data structure that has
$O(\log^2n)$ amortized update time and $O((\log n)/(\log\log n))$ amortized

  For disk graphs where the ratio $\Psi$ between the largest and smallest
radius is bounded, we consider the decremental and the incremental case
separately, in addition to the fully dynamic case. In the fully dynamic case we
achieve amortized $O(\Psi \lambda_6(\log n) \log^{9}n)$ update time and $O(\log
n)$ query time, where $\lambda_s(n)$ is the maximum length of a
Davenport-Schinzel sequence of order $s$ on $n$ symbols. This improves the
update time of the currently best known data structure by a factor of $\Psi$ at
the cost of an additional $O(\log \log n)$ factor in the query time. In the
incremental case we manage to achieve a logarithmic dependency on $\Psi$ with a
data structure with $O(\alpha(n))$ query and $O(\log\Psi \lambda_6(\log n)

that allows us to maintain two sets $B$ and $P$ of disks, such than at a
deletion of a disk from $B$ we can efficiently report all disks in $P$ that no
longer intersect any disk of $B$. Having this data structure at hand, we get
decremental data structures with an amortized query time of $O((\log n)/(\log

models. Asymptotic analysis of both models leads to four distinctive imaging
situations. We propose two uniform approximations that cover the most promising
conclusion for the passive scintillometer applications. Both the strength of
scintillation and the width of the area where scintillations exist can be used
to estimate the turbulence strength. We present the results of the
proof-of-concept experiment where images of the specifically made target were
taken by a consumer grade camera equipped with a telephoto lens. We describe
the image processing that separates the target characteristics from the
turbulence scintillations. The spatial profiles of the image variances at three
spectral bands and for several apertures were calculated. As was expected,
scintillations are concentrated around the sharp edge and are absent at the
uniformly bright parts of the target. Observed edge scintillation variances are
within the theoretical limits, and provide reasonable estimates for the
turbulence structure constant across the three spectral bands. However, the
width of the scintillation area and dependence on the aperture are inconsistent
with the thin lens imaging theory for larger apertures. We attribute this to
the Additional bench tests on bar targets revealed that the camera and lens
resolution are well below the nominal thin lens diffraction limit, and a

central machine learning and algorithmic tasks, such as regression and
clustering, as well as their more general counterparts, subspace embedding,
low-rank approximation, and coreset construction. For regression and other
numerical linear algebra related tasks, we consider the row arrival streaming
model. Our results are based on a simple, but powerful, observation that many
importance sampling-based algorithms give rise to adversarial robustness which
is in contrast to sketching based algorithms, which are very prevalent in the
streaming literature but suffer from adversarial attacks. In addition, we show
that the well-known merge and reduce paradigm in streaming is adversarially
robust. Since the merge and reduce paradigm allows coreset constructions in the
streaming setting, we thus obtain robust algorithms for $k$-means, $k$-median,
$k$-center, Bregman clustering, projective clustering, principal component
analysis (PCA) and non-negative matrix factorization. To the best of our
knowledge, these are the first adversarially robust results for these problems
yet require no new algorithmic implementations. Finally, we empirically confirm
the robustness of our algorithms on various adversarial attacks and demonstrate
that by contrast, some common existing algorithms are not robust.

discipline of theoretical fluid mechanics. Early examples include Galerkin
models inspired by the Orr-Sommerfeld stability equation and numerous vortex
models, of which the von K\'arm\'an vortex street is one of the most prominent.
Subsequent ROMs typically relied on first principles, like mathematical
Galerkin models, weakly nonlinear stability theory, and two- and
three-dimensional vortex models. Aubry et al. [N. Aubry, P. Holmes, J. Lumley,
and E. Stone, Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 192, 115-173 (1988)] pioneered
data-driven proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modeling. In early POD
modeling, available data was used to build an optimal basis, which was then
utilized in a classical Galerkin procedure to construct the ROM. But data has
made a profound impact on ROMs beyond the Galerkin expansion. In this paper, we
take a modest step and illustrate the impact of data-driven modeling on one
significant ROM area. Specifically, we focus on ROM closures, which are
correction terms that are added to classical ROMs in order to model the effect
of the discarded ROM modes in under-resolved simulations. Through simple
examples, we illustrate the main modeling principles used to construct
classical ROMs, motivate and introduce modern ROM closures, and show how
data-driven modeling, artificial intelligence, and machine learning have
changed the standard ROM methodology over the last two decades. Finally, we
outline our vision on how state-of-the-art data-driven modeling can continue to
reshape the field of reduced order modeling.

transient X-ray obscuration event in Seyfert-1 galaxy NGC 3227, and thus
triggered our joint XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
observations to study this event. Here in the first paper of our series we
present the broadband continuum modelling of the spectral energy distribution
(SED) for NGC 3227, extending from near infrared (NIR) to hard X-rays. We use
our new spectra taken with XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and HST/COS in 2019, together
with archival unobscured XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and HST/STIS data, in order to
disentangle various spectral components of NGC 3227 and recover the underlying
continuum. We find the observed NIR-optical-UV continuum is explained well by
an accretion disk blackbody component (Tmax = 10 eV), which is internally
reddened by E(B-V) = 0.45 with a Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) extinction law.
We derive the inner radius (12 Rg) and the accretion rate (0.1 solar mass per
year) of the disk by modelling the thermal disk emission. The internal
reddening in NGC 3227 is most likely associated with outflows from the dusty
AGN torus. In addition, an unreddened continuum component is also evident,
which likely arises from scattered radiation, associated with the extended
narrow-line region (NLR) of NGC 3227. The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) continuum,
and the 'soft X-ray excess', can be explained with a 'warm Comptonisation'
component. The hard X-rays are consistent with a power-law and a neutral
reflection component. The intrinsic bolometric luminosity of the AGN in NGC
3227 is about 2.2e+43 erg/s in 2019, corresponding to 3% Eddington luminosity.
Our continuum modelling of the new triggered data of NGC 3227 requires the
presence of a new obscuring gas with column density NH = 5e+22 cm^-2, partially
covering the X-ray source (Cf = 0.6).

However, sensors can fail at any time during a flight. If control firmware
mishandles sensor failures, UAVs can crash, fly away, or suffer other unsafe
conditions. In-situ model checking finds sensor failures that could lead to
unsafe conditions by systematically failing sensors. However, the type of
sensor failure and its timing within a flight affect its manifestation,
creating a large search space. We propose Avis, an in-situ model checker to
quickly uncover UAV sensor failures that lead to unsafe conditions. Widely used
control firmware already support operating modes. Avis injects sensor failures
as the control firmware transitions between modes - a key execution point where
mishandled software exceptions can trigger unsafe conditions. We implemented
Avis and applied it to ArduPilot and PX4. Avis found unsafe conditions 2.4X
faster than Bayesian Fault Injection, the leading, state-of-the-art approach.
Within the current code base of ArduPilot and PX4, Avis discovered 10
previously unknown software bugs that lead to unsafe conditions. Additionally,

operations of industrial control systems (ICS) deployed in those critical

for resilience-enhancement methodologies and techniques, working in real-time

(MR), contributes to the widespread industrial application of the MR technique
in rheology. In this paper, we designed a low-cost, palm-sized permanent magnet
with a 1H resonance frequency of 20.48 MHz to measure laminar flow. The magnet
consists of two disk magnets, which were each tilted at an angle of 1{\deg}
from a starting separation of 1.4 cm to generate a constant gradient, 65
gauss/cm, in the direction of flow. Subsequently, a series of process methods,
for MR measurements, were proposed to characterize Newtonian and non-Newtonian
fluid flows in a pipe, including phase-based method, magnitude-based method,
and velocity spectrum method. The accuracies of the proposed methods were
validated by simulations, and experiments of Poiseuille flow and shear-thinning
flow on the designed magnet. The new velocity profile methods proposed are
advantageous because the MR instrumentation and measurement methods are simple
and portable. The sophistication is found in the analysis although the physical
principles are straight forward.

towards understanding mechanisms that sculpt the architectures of planetary
systems. TOI-942 is a young field star, with an age of ~60 Myr, hosting a
planetary system consisting of two transiting Neptune-sized planets in 4.3- and
10.1-day period orbits. We observed the spectroscopic transits of the inner
Neptune TOI-942b to determine its projected orbital obliquity angle. Through
two partial transits, we find the planet to be in a prograde orbit, with a
projected obliquity angle of |lambda| = 1/+41-33 deg. In addition,
incorporating the light curve and the stellar rotation period, we find the true
three-dimensional obliquity to be 2/+27-23 deg. We explored various sources of
uncertainties specific to the spectroscopic transits of planets around young
active stars, and showed that our reported obliquity uncertainty fully
encompassed these effects. TOI-942b is one of the youngest planets to have its
obliquity characterized, and one of even fewer residing in a multi-planet
system. The prograde orbital geometry of TOI-942b is in line with systems of
similar ages, none of which have yet been identified to be in strongly
misaligned orbits.

packets between nodes using the (approximated) shortest paths. A desirable
property of these routes is a small number of hops, which makes them more
reliable, and reduces the transmission costs. Following the overwhelming
success of stochastic tree embeddings for algorithmic design, Haeupler,
Hershkowitz, and Zuzic (STOC'21) studied hop-constrained Ramsey-type metric
embeddings into trees. Specifically, embedding $f:G(V,E)\rightarrow T$ has
Ramsey hop-distortion $(t,M,\beta,h)$ (here $t,\beta,h\ge1$ and $M\subseteq V$)
if $\forall u,v\in M$, $d_G^{(\beta\cdot h)}(u,v)\le d_T(u,v)\le t\cdot
d_G^{(h)}(u,v)$. $t$ is called the distortion, $\beta$ is called the
hop-stretch, and $d_G^{(h)}(u,v)$ denotes the minimum weight of a $u-v$ path
with at most $h$ hops. Haeupler {\em et al.} constructed embedding where $M$
contains $1-\epsilon$ fraction of the vertices and $\beta=t=O(\frac{\log^2
n}{\epsilon})$. They used their embedding to obtain multiple bicriteria
approximation algorithms for hop-constrained network design problems.
  In this paper, we first improve the Ramsey-type embedding to obtain
parameters $t=\beta=\frac{\tilde{O}(\log n)}{\epsilon}$, and generalize it to
arbitrary distortion parameter $t$ (in the cost of reducing the size of $M$).
This embedding immediately implies polynomial improvements for all the
approximation algorithms from Haeupler {\em et al.}. Further, we construct
hop-constrained clan embeddings (where each vertex has multiple copies), and
use them to construct bicriteria approximation algorithms for the group Steiner
tree problem, matching the state of the art of the non constrained version.
Finally, we use our embedding results to construct hop constrained distance
oracles, distance labeling, and most prominently, the first hop constrained
compact routing scheme with provable guarantees.

originates from a population of approximately a dozen embedded super star

wind observed to emanate from the central starburst. Finally, we use the
measured recombination line fluxes to improve the characterization of overall
embedded cluster properties, including the distribution of cluster masses and
the fractional contribution of the clustered star formation to the total

Crucially, the configurations with integer topological charge but fractional

semi-classical regime, these are critical points at infinity, called neutral
bions, and since ${\rm Arg}(g^2)=0$ is a Stokes line, their Lefschetz thimbles
are two-fold ambiguous. Therein, the ambiguity in the gluon condensate is
sourced by the neutral bions. The Fourier decomposition of multi-branched
observables at strong coupling is compatible with the saddle decomposition at

today's largest online platforms, including YouTube, LinkedIn, and Pinterest.
These systems produce recommendations in two steps: (i) multiple nominators,
tuned for low prediction latency, preselect a small subset of candidates from
the whole item pool; (ii) a slower but more accurate ranker further narrows
down the nominated items, and serves to the user. Despite their popularity, the
literature on two-stage recommenders is relatively scarce, and the algorithms
are often treated as mere sums of their parts. Such treatment presupposes that
the two-stage performance is explained by the behavior of the individual
components in isolation. This is not the case: using synthetic and real-world
data, we demonstrate that interactions between the ranker and the nominators
substantially affect the overall performance. Motivated by these findings, we
derive a generalization lower bound which shows that independent nominator
training can lead to performance on par with uniformly random recommendations.
We find that careful design of item pools, each assigned to a different

mapping framework with readily extendable attribute layers. The proposed
framework goes beyond modern metric-semantic maps to provide even richer
environmental information for robots in a single mapping formalism while
exploiting intralayer and interlayer correlations. It removes the need for a
robot to access and process information from many separate maps when performing
a complex task, advancing the way robots interact with their environments. To
this end, we design a multitask deep neural network with attention mechanisms
as our front-end to provide heterogeneous observations for multiple map layers
simultaneously. Our back-end runs a scalable closed-form Bayesian inference
with only logarithmic time complexity. We apply the framework to build a dense
robotic map including metric-semantic occupancy and traversability layers.
Traversability ground truth labels are automatically generated from
exteroceptive sensory data in a self-supervised manner. We present extensive
experimental results on publicly available datasets and data collected by a 3D
bipedal robot platform and show reliable mapping performance in different
environments. Finally, we also discuss how the current framework can be
extended to incorporate more information such as friction, signal strength,
temperature, and physical quantity concentration using Gaussian map layers. The
software for reproducing the presented results or running on customized data is
made publicly available.

to flapping motions, and of large-amplitude flapping. Here we use inviscid
simulations and a linearized model to study more generally how key quantities
-- mode number (or wavenumber), frequency, and amplitude -- depend on the two
dimensionless parameters, flag mass and bending stiffness. In the limit of
small flag mass, flags perform traveling wave motions that move at nearly the
speed of the oncoming flow. The flag mode number scales as the -1/4 power of
bending stiffness. The flapping frequency has the same scaling, with an
additional slight increase with flag mass in the small-mass regime. The
flapping amplitude scales approximately as flag mass to the 1/2 power. For
large flag mass, the dominant mode number is low (0 or 1), the flapping
frequency tends to zero, and the amplitude saturates in the neighborhood of its
upper limit (the flag length). In a linearized model, the fastest growing modes
have somewhat different power law scalings for wavenumber and frequency. We
discuss how the numerical scalings are consistent with a weakly nonlinear

climate: they are not amenable to deterministic forecast, but they still depend
on the initial condition. A natural example is medium-range forecasting, which
is inherently probabilistic because it lies beyond the deterministic
predictability time of the atmosphere, but for which statistically significant
prediction can be made which depend on the current state of the system.
Similarly, one may ask the probability of occurrence of an El Ni\~no event
several months ahead of time. In this paper, we introduce a quantity which
corresponds precisely to this type of prediction problem: the committor
function is the probability that an event takes place within a given time
window, as a function of the initial condition. We explain the main
mathematical properties of this probabilistic concept, and compute it in the
case of a low-dimensional stochastic model for El-Ni\~no, the Jin and Timmerman
model. In this context, we show that the ability to predict the probability of
occurrence of the event of interest may differ strongly depending on the
initial state. The main result is the new distinction between intrinsic
probabilistic predictability (when the committor function is smooth and
probability can be computed which does not depend sensitively on the initial
condition) and intrinsic probabilistic unpredictability (when the committor
function depends sensitively on the initial condition). We also demonstrate
that the Jin and Timmerman model might be the first example of a stochastic
differential equation with weak noise for which transition between attractors
do not follow the Arrhenius law, which is expected based on large deviation
theory and generic hypothesis.

finite element method for a class of nonlinear stochastic wave equations, where
the diffusion term is globally Lipschitz continuous while the drift term is
only assumed to satisfy weaker conditions as in [11]. The novelties of this
paper are threefold. First, the error estimates cannot not be directly obtained
if the numerical scheme in primal form is used. The numerical scheme in mixed
form is introduced and several H\""{o}lder continuity results of the strong
solution are proved, which are used to establish the error estimates in both
$L^2$ norm and energy norms. Second, two types of discretization of the
nonlinear term are proposed to establish the $L^2$ stability and energy
stability results of the discrete solutions. These two types of discretization
and proper test functions are designed to overcome the challenges arising from
the stochastic scaling in time issues and the nonlinear interaction. These
stability results play key roles in proving the probability of the set on which
the error estimates hold approaches one. Third, higher order moment stability
results of the discrete solutions are proved based on an energy argument and
the underlying energy decaying property of the method. Numerical experiments
are also presented to show the stability results of the discrete solutions and
the convergence rates in various norms.

shift, for instance using entropy minimization, effectively improves
performance on such shifted distributions. This paper focuses on the fully
test-time adaptation setting, where only unlabeled data from the target
distribution is required. This allows adapting arbitrary pretrained networks.
Specifically, we propose a novel loss that improves test-time adaptation by
addressing both premature convergence and instability of entropy minimization.
This is achieved by replacing the entropy by a non-saturating surrogate and
adding a diversity regularizer based on batch-wise entropy maximization that
prevents convergence to trivial collapsed solutions. Moreover, we propose to
prepend an input transformation module to the network that can partially undo
test-time distribution shifts. Surprisingly, this preprocessing can be learned
solely using the fully test-time adaptation loss in an end-to-end fashion
without any target domain labels or source domain data. We show that our
approach outperforms previous work in improving the robustness of publicly

This improves upon the well-known $O(n^{-\frac{1}{2}})$ convergence rate of the
orthogonal greedy algorithm in many cases, most notably for dictionaries

additional assumptions on the dictionary beyond the decay rate of the entropy

their information ecosystem, allowing them to interact with their data in ways
that are hidden or abstracted in more complex tools. This is particularly true
for data workers: people who work with data as part of their job but do not

qualitative study of how these workers interact with and reason about their

cleanup at the initial stage of a linear analytic flow: users want to see and
""get their hands on"" the underlying data throughout the analytics process,
reshaping and augmenting it to support sensemaking. They reorganize, mark up,
layer on levels of detail, and spawn alternatives within the context of the
base data. These direct interactions and human-readable table representations
form a rich and cognitively important part of building understanding of what
the data mean and what they can do with it. We argue that interactive tables
are an important visualization idiom in their own right; that the direct data
interaction they afford offers a fertile design space for visual analytics; and
that sense making can be enriched by more flexible human-data interaction than

records neural activations in the brain by capturing the blood oxygen level in

the problem of predicting the state of cognitive fatigue in a person has not
been investigated to its full extent. This paper proposes tackling this issue
as a multi-class classification problem by dividing the state of cognitive
fatigue into six different levels, ranging from no-fatigue to extreme fatigue
conditions. We built a spatio-temporal model that uses convolutional neural
networks (CNN) for spatial feature extraction and a long short-term memory
(LSTM) network for temporal modeling of 4D fMRI scans. We also applied a
self-supervised method called MoCo (Momentum Contrast) to pre-train our model
on a public dataset BOLD5000 and fine-tuned it on our labeled dataset to
predict cognitive fatigue. Our novel dataset contains fMRI scans from Traumatic

convergence and generalization of gradient-based methods on nonconvex losses

generalization and in particular the critical role of small random
initialization are not fully understood. In this paper, we take a step towards
demystifying this role by proving that small random initialization followed by
a few iterations of gradient descent behaves akin to popular spectral methods.
We also show that this implicit spectral bias from small random initialization,
which is provably more prominent for overparameterized models, also puts the
gradient descent iterations on a particular trajectory towards solutions that
are not only globally optimal but also generalize well. Concretely, we focus on
the problem of reconstructing a low-rank matrix from a few measurements via a
natural nonconvex formulation. In this setting, we show that the trajectory of
the gradient descent iterations from small random initialization can be
approximately decomposed into three phases: (I) a spectral or alignment phase
where we show that that the iterates have an implicit spectral bias akin to
spectral initialization allowing us to show that at the end of this phase the
column space of the iterates and the underlying low-rank matrix are
sufficiently aligned, (II) a saddle avoidance/refinement phase where we show
that the trajectory of the gradient iterates moves away from certain degenerate
saddle points, and (III) a local refinement phase where we show that after
avoiding the saddles the iterates converge quickly to the underlying low-rank
matrix. Underlying our analysis are insights for the analysis of
overparameterized nonconvex optimization schemes that may have implications for
computational problems beyond low-rank reconstruction.

first and second partial derivatives of ray velocities along ray paths in
general anisotropic elastic media. These derivatives are used in solving
kinematic problems, like two-point ray bending methods and seismic tomography,
and they are essential for evaluating the dynamic properties along the rays
(amplitudes and phases). The traveltime is delivered through an integral over a
given Lagrangian defined at each point along the ray. Although the Lagrangian
cannot be explicitly expressed in terms of the medium properties and the ray
direction components, its derivatives can still be formulated analytically
using the corresponding arclength-related Hamiltonian that can be explicitly
expressed in terms of the medium properties and the slowness vector components.
This requires first to invert for the slowness vector components, given the ray
direction components. Computation of the slowness vector and the ray velocity
derivatives is considerably simplified by using an auxiliary
scaled-time-related Hamiltonian obtained directly from the Christoffel equation
and connected to the arclength-related Hamiltonian by a simple scale factor.
This study consists of two parts. In Part I, we consider general anisotropic
(triclinic) media, and provide the derivatives (gradients and Hessians) of the
ray velocity, with respect to (1) the spatial/directional vectors and (2) the
elastic model parameters. In Part II, we apply the theory of Part I explicitly
to polar anisotropic media (transverse isotropy with tilted axis of symmetry,
TTI), and obtain the explicit ray velocity derivatives for the coupled qP and
qSV waves and for SH waves.

gives a sharp distinction between chaotic and regular dynamics and allows
accurate computation of rotation vectors for regular orbits. Resonant and
rotational tori are distinguished by computing the resonance order of the
rotation vector to a given precision. Critical parameter values, where tori are
destroyed, are computed by a sharp decrease in convergence rate of the Birkhoff
average. We apply these methods for a three-dimensional generalization of
Chirikov's standard map: an angle-action map with two angle variables.
Computations on grids in frequency and perturbation amplitude allow estimates

show that an ultrathin optical limiter with low threshold intensity can be
realized using a nonlinear zone plate. The zone plate is embedded with
nonlinear saturable absorbing materials that allow the device to focus low
intensity light, while high intensity light is transmitted as a plane wave
without a focal spot. Based on this proposed mechanism, we use the
finite-difference time-domain method to computationally design a zone plate
embedded with InAs quantum dots as the saturable absorbing material. The device
has a thickness of just 0.5 $\mu m$ and exhibits good optical limiting behavior
with a threshold intensity as low as 0.45 kW/$cm^2$, which is several orders of
magnitude lower than current ultrathin flat-optics-based optical limiters. This
design can be optimized for different operating wavelengths and threshold
intensities by using different saturable absorbing materials. Additionally, the
diameter and focal length of the nonlinear zone plate can be easily adjusted to
fit different systems and applications. Due to its flexible design, low power
threshold, and ultrathin thickness, this optical limiting concept may be
promising for application in miniaturized optical systems.

fields in implementing the conformal method to parameterize and construct
solutions of Einstein constraint equations with coupled matter sources. The
approach is based on a phase space representation of the space-time matter
fields after a careful $n+1$ decomposition into spatial fields $B$ and
conjugate momenta $\Pi_B$, which are specified directly and are conformally
invariant quantities. We show that if the Einstein-matter field theory is
specified by a Lagrangian which is diffeomorphism invariant and involves no
dependence on derivatives of the space-time metric in the matter portion of the
Lagrangian, then fixing $B$ and $\Pi_B$ results in conformal constraint
equations that, for constant-mean curvature initial data, semi-decouple just as
they do for the vacuum Einstein conformal constraint equations. We prove this
result by establishing a structural property of the Einstein momentum
constraint that is independent of the conformal method: For an Einstein-matter
field theory which satisfies the conditions just stated, if $B$ and $\Pi_B$
satisfy the matter Euler-Lagrange equations, then (in suitable form) the
right-hand side of the momentum constraint on each spatial slice depends only
on $B$ and $\Pi_B$ and is independent of the space-time metric. We discuss the
details of our construction in the special cases of the following models:
Einstein-Maxwell-charged scalar field, Einstein-Proca, Einstein-perfect fluid,
and Einstein-Maxwell-charged dust. In these examples we find that our technique
gives a theoretical basis for scaling rules, such as those for
electromagnetism, that have worked pragmatically in the past, but also
generates new equations with advantageous features for perfect fluids that
allow direct specification of total rest mass and total charge in any spatial

characterized by (often repetitive) slowly rising standstills terminated by
brightening, but the exact mechanism for this variation is not yet identified.
We have identified BO Cet, which had been considered as a novalike cataclysmic
variable, as a new member of IW And stars based on the behavior in 2019-2020.
In addition to this, the object showed dwarf nova-type outbursts in 2020-2021,
and superhumps having a period 7.8% longer than the orbital one developed at
least during one long outburst. This object has been confirmed as an SU
UMa-type dwarf nova with an exceptionally long orbital period (0.1398 d). BO
Cet is thus the first cataclysmic variable showing both SU UMa-type and IW
And-type features. We obtained a mass ratio (q) of 0.31-0.34 from the
superhumps in the growing phase (stage A superhumps). At this q, the radius of
the 3:1 resonance, responsible for tidal instability and superhumps, and the
tidal truncation radius are very similar. We interpret that in some occasions
this object showed IW And-type variation when the disk size was not large
enough, but that the radius of the 3:1 resonance could be reached as the result
of thermal instability. We also discuss that there are SU UMa-type dwarf novae
above q=0.30, which is above the previously considered limit (q~0.25) derived
from numerical simulations and that this is possible since the radius of the
3:1 resonance is inside the tidal truncation radius. We constrained the mass of
the white dwarf larger than 1.0Msol, which may be responsible for the IW
And-type behavior and the observed strength of the He II emission. The exact
reason, however, why this object is unique in that it shows both SU UMa-type
and IW And-type features is still unsolved.

introduced to provide locally optimal reference trajectories to the onboard

Routing Problem (CVRP) on several classes of graphs. In CVRP, introduced by
Dantzig and Ramser (1959), we are given a graph $G=(V,E)$ with metric edges
costs, a depot $r\in V$, and a vehicle of bounded capacity $Q$. The goal is to
find minimum cost collection of tours for the vehicle that returns to the
depot, each visiting at most $Q$ nodes, such that they cover all the nodes.
This generalizes classic TSP and has been studied extensively. In the more
general setting, each node $v$ has a demand $d_v$ and the total demand of each
tour must be no more than $Q$. Either the demand of each node must be served by
one tour (unsplittable) or can be served by multiple tour (splittable). The
best known approximation algorithm for general graphs has ratio
$\alpha+2(1-\epsilon)$ (for the unsplittable) and $\alpha+1-\epsilon$ (for the
splittable) for some fixed $\epsilon>\frac{1}{3000}$, where $\alpha$ is the
best approximation for TSP. Even for the case of trees, the best approximation
ratio is $4/3$ by Becker (2018) and it has been an open question if there is an
approximation scheme for this simple class of graphs. Das and Mathieu (2015)
presented an approximation scheme with time $n^{\log^{O(1/\epsilon)}n}$ for
Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}^2$. No other approximation scheme is known for any
other class of metrics (without further restrictions on $Q$). In this paper, we
make significant progress on this classic problem by presenting
Quasi-Polynomial Time Approximation Schemes (QPTAS) for graphs of bounded
treewidth, graphs of bounded highway dimensions, and graphs of bounded doubling
dimensions. For comparison, our result implies an approximation scheme for
Euclidean plane with run time $n^{O(\log^{10}n/\epsilon^{9})}$.

mechanism of the synchronous BAS. Different from the classical spin-orbit
coupling model which neglects the rotational motion's influence on the orbital
motion, our model considers simultaneously the orbital motion and the
rotational motions. Our findings are following. (1) Stable region of the
secondary's synchronous state is mainly up to the secondary's shape. The
primary's shape has little influence on it. (2) The stable region shrinks
continuously with the increasing value of the secondary's shape parameter
$a_B/b_B$. Beyond the value of $a_B/b_B=\sqrt{2}$, the planar stable region for
the secondary's synchronous rotation is small but not zero. (3) Considering the
BYORP torque, our model shows agreement with the 1-degree of freedom adiabatic
invariance theory in the outwards migration process, but an obvious difference
in the inwards migration process. In particular, our studies show that the
so-called 'long-term' stable equilibrium between the BYORP torque and the tidal
torque is never a real equilibrium state, although the binary asteroid system
can be captured in this state for quite a long time. (4) In case that the
primary's angular velocity gradually reduces due to the YORP effect, the
secondary's synchronous state may be broken when the primary's rotational
motion crosses some major spin-orbit resonances.

result: metrics almost maximizing the normalized eigenvalue must be

quantitative stability of the celebrated Hersch's inequality for the first

Lagrangian and the interior-point technique. It shares a similar algorithmic
framework with existing ALMs for optimization with inequality constraints, but
it can use the second derivatives and does not depend on projections on the set
of inequality constraints. In each iteration, our method solves a twice
continuously differentiable unconstrained optimization subproblem on primal
variables. The dual iterates, penalty and smoothing parameters are updated
adaptively. The global and local convergence are analyzed. Without assuming any
constraint qualification, it is proved that the proposed method has strong
global convergence. The method may converge to either a Kurash-Kuhn-Tucker
(KKT) point or a singular stationary point when the converging point is a
minimizer. It may also converge to an infeasible stationary point of nonlinear
program when the problem is infeasible. Furthermore, our method is capable of
rapidly detecting the possible infeasibility of the solved problem. Under
suitable conditions, it is locally linearly convergent to the KKT point, which
is consistent with ALMs for optimization with equality constraints. The

are particularly suitable for such scenarios called event cameras, which have a
high temporal resolution, low-latency, and high dynamic range.
  In this paper, we model the geometry of a propeller and use it to generate
simulated events which are used to train a deep neural network called EVPropNet
to detect propellers from the data of an event camera. EVPropNet directly
transfers to the real world without any fine-tuning or retraining. We present
two applications of our network: (a) tracking and following an unmarked drone

nonlinearities, and the populations initially prepared in the two atomic ground
states. Interestingly, a crossover from mixture to separation in space (optical
phase separation) of the two polarization components occurs when the ratio
between the cross- and self-Kerr nonlinearities exceeds a critical value. We
also show that the system supports nonlocal two-component spatial optical
solitons and vortices when the parameters of the system are selected suitably.
The rich diversity and active controllability of the self-organized optical
structures reported here provide a way for realizing novel optical patterns and
solitons and their structural phase transitions based on Rydberg atomic gases.

Knowledge Graph (KG) due to its high expressivity and compatibility for

of standard benchmarks for studying and comparing different external knowledge
settings and different KG-based ZSL methods. In this paper, we proposed six
resources covering three tasks, i.e., zero-shot image classification (ZS-IMGC),
zero-shot relation extraction (ZS-RE), and zero-shot KG completion (ZS-KGC).
Each resource has a normal ZSL benchmark and a KG containing semantics ranging
from text to attribute, from relational knowledge to logical expressions. We
have clearly presented these resources including their construction,
statistics, data formats and usage cases w.r.t. different ZSL methods. More
importantly, we have conducted a comprehensive benchmarking study, with two
general and state-of-the-art methods, two setting-specific methods and one

applications involving distributed iterative processes that are executed on
networked computing resources. Such an application consists of multiple tasks,
each of which outputs data at each iteration to be processed by neighboring
tasks; these dependencies between the tasks can be represented as a directed
graph. We first mathematically formulate the problem as a Binary Quadratic
Program (BQP), accounting for both computation and communication costs. We show
that the problem is NP-hard. We then relax the problem as a Semi-Definite
Program (SDP) and utilize a randomized rounding technique based on sampling
from a suitably-formulated multi-variate Gaussian distribution. Furthermore, we
derive the expected value of bottleneck time. Finally, we apply our proposed
scheme on gossip-based federated learning as an application of iterative
processes. Through numerical evaluations on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, we
show that our proposed approach outperforms well-known scheduling techniques
from distributed computing. In particular, for arbitrary settings, we show that
it reduces bottleneck time by $91\%$ compared to HEFT and $84\%$ compared to

area. Edge computing can reduce the cost of cloud communication, including high
latency and bandwidth use, by moving conventional healthcare services and

complex dependency among the microbial taxa. However, existing statistical
models for such data either do not adequately account for the dependency among
the microbial taxa or lack computational scalability with respect to the number
of taxa. This presents challenges in important applications such as association
analysis between microbiome compositions and disease risk in which valid
statistical analysis requires appropriately incorporating the ""variance
components"" or ""random effects"" in the microbiome composition. We introduce a
generative model, called the ""logistic-tree normal"" (LTN) model, that addresses
this need. LTN marries two popular classes of models-namely, log-ratio normal
(LN) and Dirichlet-tree (DT)-and inherits the key benefits of each. LTN
incorporates the tree-based binomial decomposition as the DT does, but it
jointly models the corresponding binomial probabilities using a (multivariate)
logistic-normal distribution as in LN models. It therefore allows rich
covariance structures as LN, along with computational efficiency realized
through a Polya-Gamma augmentation on the binomial models associated with the
tree splits. Accordingly, Bayesian inference on LTN can readily proceed by
Gibbs sampling. LTN also allows common techniques for effective inference on
high-dimensional data to be readily incorporated. We construct a general
mixed-effects model using LTN to characterize compositional random effects,
which allows flexible taxa covariance. We demonstrate its use in testing
association between microbiome composition and disease risk as well as in
estimating the covariance among taxa. We carry out an extensive case study
using this LTN-enriched compositional mixed-effects model to analyze a

that the other, less well-studied, Type II GCs should also exhibit similar

1261, an intermediate mass Type II GC, in order to determine if this object
shows an intrinsic Fe variation. We determined the Fe abundance in eight red
giant members using Magellan-MIKE and UVES-FLAMES high-resolution, high S/N

is from -1.05 to -1.43 dexwith an observed spread sigma_obs=0.133 dex. Compared
with the total internal error of Sigma_tot=0.06,this indicates a significant
intrinsic metallicity spread of Sigma_int=0.119 dex. We found a very similar
variation in [Fe/H] using an independent method to derive the atmospheric
parameters based on near-IR photometry. More importantly, the mean metallicity
of the five presumed normal metallicity stars is -1.37+/-0.02, while that of
the three presumed anomalous/highmetallicity stars is -1.18+/-0.09. This
difference is significant at the $\pm$2.4Sigma level. We find indications from
existing data of other Type II GCs that several of them presumedto have real
metallicity spreads may in fact posses none. The minimum mass required for a GC
to acquire an intrinsic Fe spread appears to be $\pm$10^5 Msun. We find no
strong correlation betwee nmass and metallicity variation for Type II GCs. The
metallicity spread is also independent of the fraction of anomalous stars
within the Type II GCs and of GC origin.

resource in engineered and natural systems, but measuring entanglement in
experiment remains elusive especially for large chemical systems. Most
practical approaches require determining and measuring a suitable entanglement
witness which provides some level of information about the entanglement
structure of the probed state. A fundamental quantity of quantum metrology is
the quantum Fisher information (QFI) which is a rigorous witness of
multipartite entanglement that can be evaluated from linear response functions
for certain states. In this work, we explore measuring the QFI of molecular
exciton states of the first-excitation subspace from spectroscopy. In
particular, we utilize the fact that the linear response of a pure state
subject to a weak electric field over all possible driving frequencies encodes
the variance of the collective dipole moment in the probed state, which is a
valid measure for QFI. The systems that are investigated include the molecular
dimer, $N$-site linear aggregate with nearest-neighbor coupling, and $N$-site
circular aggregate, all modeled as a collection of interacting qubits. Our
theoretical analysis shows that the variance of the collective dipole moment in
the brightest dipole-allowed eigenstate is the maximum QFI. The optical
response of a thermally equilibrated state in the first-excitation subspace is
also a valid QFI. Theoretical predictions of the measured QFI for realistic
linear dye aggregates as a function of temperature and energetic disorder due
to static variations of the host matrix show that 2- to 3-partite entanglement
is realizable. This work lays some groundwork and inspires measurement of
multipartite entanglement of molecular excitons with ultrafast pump-probe

not sufficient for a successful domain adaptation. It shows that besides a
small source error, both the discrepancy between the feature distributions and
the discrepancy between the labeling functions should be small across domains.
The discrepancy between the labeling functions is essentially the cross-domain
errors which are ignored by existing methods. To overcome this issue, in this
paper, a novel method is proposed to integrate all the objectives into a
unified optimization framework. Moreover, the incorrect pseudo labels widely
used in previous methods can lead to error accumulation during learning. To
alleviate this problem, the pseudo labels are obtained by utilizing structural

more accurate calculation of hydrodynamics and radiative acceleration is
required to reduce the number of free parameters in spectral fitting, to
determine accurate wind parameters such as mass-loss rates and velocity
profiles.
  We use the non-LTE model-atmosphere code CMFGEN to numerically solve the
radiative transfer equation in the stellar atmosphere and to calculate the
radiative acceleration $g_\text{rad}(r)$. Under the assumption that the
radiative acceleration depends only on the radial coordinate, we solve
analytically the equation of motion by means of the Lambert $W$-function. An
iterative procedure between the solution of the radiative transfer and the
equation of motion is executed in order to obtain a final self-consistent
velocity field that is no longer based on any $\beta$-law.
  We apply the Lambert-procedure to three O supergiant stars ($\zeta$-Puppis,
HD~165763 and $\alpha$-Cam) and discuss the Lambert-solutions for the velocity
profiles. It is found that, even without recalculation of the mass-loss rate,
the Lambert-procedure allows the calculation of consistent velocity profiles
that reduce the number of free parameters when a spectral fitting using CMFGEN
is performed. Synthetic spectra calculated from our Lambert-solutions show
significant differences compared to the initial $\beta$-law CMFGEN models. The
results indicate the importance of consistent velocity profile calculation in
the CMFGEN code and its usage in a fitting procedure and interpretation of

parameters is consistent with other findings reported in the literature. The
initially imposed gauge invariant regularization was consistently recovered at
the end of the calculation by the appearance of highly non-trivial combinations
of the covariant derivatives, which ultimately managed to give only terms
containing the electromagnetic tensor. We emphasize that the value of the
anomaly with an arbitrary parameter is not automatically related to the
effective action describing the electromagnetic response of such materials

unpopular, an open-source Python package to de-trend TESS FFI light curves

variations across multiple distant pixels are likely to be systematics,
unpopular removes these common (i.e., popular) trends by modeling the
systematics in a given pixel's light curve as a linear combination of light
curves from many other distant pixels. To prevent overfitting we employ ridge
regression and a train-and-test framework where the data points being
de-trended are separated from those used to obtain the model coefficients. We
also allow for simultaneous fitting with a polynomial model to capture any
long-term astrophysical trends. We validate our method by de-trending different
sources (e.g., supernova, tidal disruption event, exoplanet-hosting star, fast
rotating star) and comparing our light curves to those obtained by other
pipelines when appropriate. We also show that unpopular is able to preserve
sector-length astrophysical signals, allowing for the extraction of
multi-sector light curves from the FFI data. The unpopular source code and

  Reference","11 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Semi-supervised learning is a challenging problem which aims to construct a
model by learning from a limited number of labeled examples. Numerous methods
have been proposed to tackle this problem, with most focusing on utilizing the
predictions of unlabeled instances consistency alone to regularize networks.
However, treating labeled and unlabeled data separately often leads to the
discarding of mass prior knowledge learned from the labeled examples, and
failure to mine the feature interaction between the labeled and unlabeled image
pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel method for semi-supervised semantic
segmentation named GuidedMix-Net, by leveraging labeled information to guide
the learning of unlabeled instances. Specifically, we first introduce a feature
alignment objective between labeled and unlabeled data to capture potentially
similar image pairs and then generate mixed inputs from them. The proposed
mutual information transfer (MITrans), based on the cluster assumption, is
shown to be a powerful knowledge module for further progressive refining
features of unlabeled data in the mixed data space. To take advantage of the
labeled examples and guide unlabeled data learning, we further propose a mask
generation module to generate high-quality pseudo masks for the unlabeled data.
Along with supervised learning for labeled data, the prediction of unlabeled
data is jointly learned with the generated pseudo masks from the mixed data.
Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL-Context and Cityscapes
demonstrate the effectiveness of our GuidedMix-Net, which achieves competitive
segmentation accuracy and significantly improves the mIoU by +7$\%$ compared to
previous state-of-the-art approaches.

similar performance on these benchmarks may have unobserved performance
differences on the other sub-tasks. To allow insightful comparisons between
competitive end-to-end architectures, we propose a framework to construct
robust test sets using coordinate ascent over sub-task specific utility

creates a test set for each sub-task to individually assess sub-components of
the end-to-end model. Using spoken language understanding as a case study, we
generate new splits for the Fluent Speech Commands and Snips SmartLights
datasets. Each split has two test sets: one with held-out utterances assessing
natural language understanding abilities, and one with held-out speakers to
test speech processing skills. Our splits identify performance gaps up to 10%
between end-to-end systems that were within 1% of each other on the original
test sets. These performance gaps allow more realistic and actionable
comparisons between different architectures, driving future model development.

convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on computer vision tasks. Despite its
pervasiveness, we have a poor understanding of what its effectiveness stems
from. It is popularly believed that its effectiveness stems from the visual
attention explanation, advocating focusing on the important part of input data
rather than ingesting the entire input. In this paper, we find that there is
only a weak consistency between the attention weights of features and their
importance. Instead, we verify the crucial role of feature map multiplication
in attention mechanism and uncover a fundamental impact of feature map
multiplication on the learned landscapes of CNNs: with the high order
non-linearity brought by the feature map multiplication, it played a
regularization role on CNNs, which made them learn smoother and more stable
landscapes near real samples compared to vanilla CNNs. This smoothness and
stability induce a more predictive and stable behavior in-between real samples,
and make CNNs generate better. Moreover, motivated by the proposed
effectiveness of feature map multiplication, we design feature map
multiplication network (FMMNet) by simply replacing the feature map addition in
ResNet with feature map multiplication. FMMNet outperforms ResNet on various
datasets, and this indicates that feature map multiplication plays a vital role
in improving the performance even without finely designed attention mechanism
in existing methods.

Such training objective is sub-optimal when the target sequence is not perfect,
e.g., when the target sequence is corrupted with noises, or when only weak
sequence supervision is available. To address the challenge, we propose a novel
Edit-Invariant Sequence Loss (EISL), which computes the matching loss of a

be robust to various noises and edits in the target sequences. Moreover, the
EISL computation is essentially an approximate convolution operation with
target n-grams as kernels, which is easy to implement and efficient to compute
with existing libraries. To demonstrate the effectiveness of EISL, we conduct
experiments on a wide range of tasks, including machine translation with noisy

from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory

Relations Observatory (STEREO). This data-constrained initial state is then
relaxed to a force-free state by the magneto-frictional module in MPI-AMRVAC.
The further time-evolving simulation results reproduce the eruption
characteristics obtained by SDO/AIA 94 A, 304 A, and STEREO/EUVI 304 A
observations fairly well. The simulated flux rope possesses similar eruption
direction, height range, and velocities to the observations. Especially, the
two phases of slow evolution and fast eruption are reproduced by varying the
density distribution in light of the filament material draining process. Our
data-constrained simulations also show other advantages, such as a large field
of view (about 0.76 solar radii). We study the twist of the magnetic flux rope
and the decay index of the overlying field, and find that in this event, both
the magnetic strapping force and the magnetic tension force are sufficiently
weaker than the magnetic hoop force, thus allowing the successful eruption of

the current contribution presents a theoretical framework for analyzing the

Building upon the derived analytical expressions, we present novel closed-form

Equatorial-Depth Survey (eFEDS). We study the eROSITA X-ray imaging data for a
sample of 325 clusters and groups that are significantly detected in the eFEDS

dynamical estimators: concentration, central density, cuspiness, ellipticity,
power-ratios, photon asymmetry, and Gini coefficient. The galaxy clusters and
groups detected in eFEDS, covering a luminosity range of more than three orders
of magnitude and large redshift range out to 1.2 provide an ideal sample for
studying the redshift and luminosity evolution of the morphological parameters
and characterization of the underlying dynamical state of the sample. Based on
these measurements we construct a new dynamical indicator, relaxation score,
for all the clusters in the sample. We find no evidence for bimodality in the
distribution of morphological parameters of our clusters, rather we observe a
smooth transition from the cool-core to non-cool-core and from relaxed to
disturbed states. A significant evolution in redshift and luminosity is also
observed in the morphological parameters examined in this study after carefully
taking into account the selection effects. We determine that our eFEDS-selected

velocity derivatives directly for polar anisotropic (transverse isotropy with
tilted axis of symmetry, TTI) media for the coupled qP and qSV waves and for SH

The medium properties, normally specified at regular three-dimensional fine
grid points, are the five material parameters: the axial compressional and
shear velocities and the three Thomsen parameters, and two geometric
parameters: the polar angles defining the local direction of the medium
symmetry axis. All the parameters are assumed spatially (smoothly) varying,

anellipticity) and the second, unconsolidated sand rocks with strong negative
anellipticity (manifesting a qSV triplication). The ray velocity derivatives
obtained in this part are first tested by comparing them with the corresponding
numerical (finite difference) derivatives. Additionally, we show that exactly
the same results (ray velocity derivatives) can be obtained if we transform the
given polar anisotropic model parameters (five material and two geometric) into

measurements to learn governing dynamics of a system. In this paper, we
investigate how fusion of output measurements with state measurements affects
the dictionary selection process in Koopman operator learning problems. While
prior methods use dynamical conjugacy to show a direct link between Koopman
eigenfunctions in two distinct data spaces (measurement channels), we explore
the specific case where output measurements are nonlinear, non-invertible
functions of the system state. This setup reflects the measurement constraints
of many classes of physical systems, e.g., biological measurement data, where
one type of measurement does not directly transform to another. We propose
output constrained Koopman operators (OC-KOs) as a new framework to fuse two
measurement sets. We show that OC-KOs are effective for sensor fusion by
proving that when learning a Koopman operator, output measurement functions
serve to constrain the space of potential Koopman observables and their
eigenfunctions. Further, low-dimensional output measurements can be embedded to
inform selection of Koopman dictionary functions for high-dimensional models.
We propose two algorithms to identify OC-KO representations directly from data:
a direct optimization method that uses state and output data simultaneously and
a sequential optimization method. We prove a theorem to show that the solution
spaces of the two optimization problems are equivalent. We illustrate these
findings with a theoretical example and two numerical simulations.

unconventional chiral fermions that extend beyond the common Dirac and Weyl

exotic quasiparticle. To date, the spin transport properties in the spin-1
chiral semimetals, have not been explored yet. In this work, we fabricated
B20-CoSi thin films on sapphire c-plane substrates by magnetron sputtering and
studied the spin Hall effect (SHE) by combining experiments and

heterostructures was investigated via spin Hall magnetoresistance and harmonic
Hall measurements. First-principles calculations yield an intrinsic spin Hall

fermion-mediated Hall conductivities that exhibit a peak-like structure
centering around the topological node, SHC of B20-CoSi is odd and crosses zero
at the node with two antisymmetric local extrema of opposite sign situated
below and above in energy. Hybridization between Co d-Si p orbitals and
spin-orbit coupling are essential for the SHC, despite the small (~1%) weight
of Si p-orbital near the Fermi level. This work expands the horizon of
topological spintronics and highlights the importance of Fermi-level tuning in

  shallow landslide initiation","22 pages, 10 figures",,,,"physics.geo-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Numerous early warning systems based on rainfall measurements have been
designed over the last decades to forecast the onset of rainfall-induced
shallow landslides. However, their use over large areas poses challenges due to
uncertainties related with the interaction among various controlling factors.
We propose a hybrid stochastic-mechanical approach to quantify the role of the
hydro-mechanical factors influencing slope stability and rank their importance.
The proposed methodology relies on a physically-based model of landslide
triggering, and a stochastic approach treating selected model parameters as
correlated aleatory variables. The features of the methodology are illustrated
by referencing data for Campania, an Italian region characterized by
landslide-prone volcanic deposits. Synthetic intensity-duration (ID) thresholds
are computed through Monte Carlo simulations. Several key variables are treated
as aleatoric, constraining their statistical properties through available
measurements. The variabilities of topographic features (e.g., slope angle),
physical and hydrological properties (e.g., porosity, dry unit weight
${\gamma}_d$, and saturated hydraulic conductivity, $K_s$), and pre-rainstorm
suction is evaluated to inspect its role on the resulting scatter of ID
thresholds. We find that: i) $K_s$ is most significant for high-intensity
storms; ii) in steep slopes, changes in pressure head greatly reduce the
timescale of landslide triggering, making the system heavily reliant on initial
conditions; iii) for events occurring at long failure times (gentle slopes
and/or low intensity storms), the significance of the evolving stress level
(through ${\gamma}_d$) is highest. The proposed approach can be translated to
other regions, expanded to encompass new aleatory variables, and combined with
other hydro-mechanical triggering models.

universal for arbitrary spatial mode multiplexing, which is launched by a

collapsing process. The collapsing process is examined first separately for
dust cloud and dark energy and then under the combined effect of dust
interacting with dark energy. It is obtained that when only dust cloud or dark
energy is present the collapse leads to the formation of black-hole under
certain conditions. When both of them are present, collapsing star does not
form black-hole. However when dark energy is considered as cosmological
constant, the collapse leads to black hole formation.

challenging task in natural language generation. Since several given topics
only provide limited source information, utilizing various topic-related
knowledge is essential for improving essay generation performance. However,
previous works cannot sufficiently use that knowledge to facilitate the
generation procedure. This paper aims to improve essay generation by extracting
information from both internal and external knowledge. Thus, a topic-to-essay
generation model with comprehensive knowledge enhancement, named TEGKE, is
proposed. For internal knowledge enhancement, both topics and related essays
are fed to a teacher network as source information. Then, informative features
would be obtained from the teacher network and transferred to a student network
which only takes topics as input but provides comparable information compared
with the teacher network. For external knowledge enhancement, a topic knowledge
graph encoder is proposed. Unlike the previous works only using the nearest
neighbors of topics in the commonsense base, our topic knowledge graph encoder
could exploit more structural and semantic information of the commonsense
knowledge graph to facilitate essay generation. Moreover, the adversarial

the HID, the source was in the soft banana state during these observations.
Spectral modeling was performed using the full reflection framework and an
inner disk radii of 14 Rg was obtained. A hard powerlaw tail was noticed in the
soft state and hot component fluxes and varying powerlaw indices point towards
a varying corona/sub-keplerian flow. Based on the spectral fits the boundary
layer radius and magnetospheric radius were constrained to be $\sim$ 14-18 km
and $\sim$ 9-19 km respectively. Cross- Correlation Function studies were
performed between the 0.8-3 keV soft SXT lightcurve and 10-20 keV hard LAXPC
lightcurve and correlated and anticorrelated lags were found, which was used to
constrain the coronal height to 0.6-20 km (\b{eta}=0.1). Since the inner disk
radius is not varying during the observations, we conclude that the detected
lags are possibly caused by a varying structure of corona/boundary layer in the
inner region of the accretion disk. Based on the observations, a geometrical
model is proposed for explaining the detected lags in the atoll source 4U

important role in post-transcriptional gene regulation. However, the
experimental determination of miRNA sequence and structure is both expensive
and time-consuming. Therefore, computational and machine learning-based
approaches have been adopted to predict novel microRNAs. With the involvement
of data science and machine learning in biology, multiple research studies have
been conducted to find microRNAs with different computational methods and
different miRNA features. Multiple approaches are discussed in detail
considering the learning algorithm/s used, features considered, dataset/s used
and the criteria used in evaluations. This systematic review focuses on the
machine learning methods developed for miRNA identification in plants. This
will help researchers to gain a detailed idea about past studies and identify
novel paths that solve drawbacks occurred in past studies. Our findings
highlight the need for plant-specific computational methods for miRNA
identification.

  intergranular corrosion of an Al-Li-Cu-Mg alloy",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Intermetallic phases in a recently developed Al-Li-Cu-Mg alloy have been
investigated to understand their roles in the initiation and propagation
processes of intergranular corrosion. Corrosion initiation involves trenching
formation in the Al matrix adjacent to the large particles of Al7Cu2(Fe, Mn)
phases. These phases containing Li are electrochemically active and susceptible
to self-dissolution via a de-alloying mechanism during corrosion process. The
subsurface particles of Al7Cu2(Fe, Mn) and Al20Cu2Mn3 phases act as the
internal cathodes for continuous corrosion propagation along the
particle-matrix interface and the associated grain boundaries. Corrosion
propagation along the particle-matrix interface was facilitated by the anodic
dissolution of the surrounding Al matrix due to the micro-galvanic interaction
with the cathodic intermetallic phases. In addition, T1 (Al2CuLi) precipitates
and the isolated particles of Al7Cu2(Fe, Mn) and Al20Cu2Mn3 phases were
dissolved along the path of corrosion propagation. The dissolved metal ions
were redeposited through the network of crevice.

  Camera",,"BMSB, May 2021, Paris, France",,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many algorithms for visible light positioning (VLP) localization do not
consider the shapes of the transmitters, which leads to the impracticality of
the algorithm and the low localization accuracy. Therefore, this paper proposes
a novel VLP algorithm and addresses the problems in terms of practicality and
complexity by using one non-point transmitter based on a monocular. Because the
shape of the transmitter is considered, the proposed algorithm is easy for
practice and has wide applicability. Besides, it decreases the computation for
simple geometric model and expands the coverage for there is a greater chance
of receiving signals from one light than that of receiving signals from
multiple lights.

polynomials is a well-studied problem. But the numb er of the zeros and regions
containing all the zeros of complex-valued harmonic polynomials is relatively a
fresh research area. It is well known that all the zeros of analytic trinomials
are enclosed in some annular sectors that take into account the magnitude of
the coefficients. Following Kennedy and Dehmer, we provide the zero inclusion
regions of all the zeros of complex-valued harmonic polynomials in general, and
in particular, we bound all the zeros of some families of harmonic trinomials
in a certain annular region.

coalescences in LIGO's and Virgo's third observing run with properties
consistent with neutron star-black hole (NSBH) binaries. The two events are
named GW200105_162426 and GW200115_042309, abbreviated as GW200105 and
GW200115; the first was observed by LIGO Livingston and Virgo, and the second
by all three LIGO-Virgo detectors. The source of GW200105 has component masses
$8.9^{+1.2}_{-1.5}\,M_\odot$ and $1.9^{+0.3}_{-0.2}\,M_\odot$, whereas the
source of GW200115 has component masses $5.7^{+1.8}_{-2.1}\,M_\odot$ and
$1.5^{+0.7}_{-0.3}\,M_\odot$ (all measurements quoted at the 90% credible
level). The probability that the secondary's mass is below the maximal mass of
a neutron star is 89%-96% and 87%-98%, respectively, for GW200105 and GW200115,
with the ranges arising from different astrophysical assumptions. The source
luminosity distances are $280^{+110}_{-110}$ Mpc and $300^{+150}_{-100}$ Mpc,
respectively. The magnitude of the primary spin of GW200105 is less than 0.23
at the 90% credible level, and its orientation is unconstrained. For GW200115,
the primary spin has a negative spin projection onto the orbital angular
momentum at 88% probability. We are unable to constrain spin or tidal
deformation of the secondary component for either event. We infer a NSBH merger
rate density of $45^{+75}_{-33}\,\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ when
assuming GW200105 and GW200115 are representative of the NSBH population, or
$130^{+112}_{-69}\,\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ under the assumption of
a broader distribution of component masses.

  gravity","11 pages, 6 figures",,,,"quant-ph gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the effect of gravity on extended quantum systems (EQS) in the
low energy regime. We model the gravitational effect due to a nearby source
mass as a redshift in the internal Hamiltonian of the EQS. Due to the
dependence of the energy spectrum of the EQS on the position of the massive
particle (via the redshift) at zero temperature, our model predicts
gravitational decoherence of the massive particle in the position basis. We
show that the decoherence effect is multiplicative, in the sense that the
increase in number of EQS gravitationally interacting with a single massive
particle leads to an increase in its decoherence. If the considered model of
gravitational redshift holds alongside the linearity of quantum mechanics (as
an appropriate limit of an accepted theory for coupling quantum matter with
gravity) to allow for a spatial superposition of the source mass, we propose
that the same methodology can be applied to continuous fields, which are
essentially EQS. This could provide an upper limit on the number of
undiscovered fields by observing coherent superpositions of masses, e.g., in a
matter wave interferometer. Besides, by taking a spin chain as a toy model of
an EQS, we analyse the dependence of the new effect on relevant system
parameters and identify the number of independent spin chains that can cause a
detectable effect.

we propose a novel model, Mining Undefined Classes from Other-class (MUCO),

will improve the discriminative ability of NER classifier and enhance the
understanding of predefined classes with stand-by semantic knowledge.
Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms five

collimated beam of photons with energies of hundreds of MeV, that collide with
keV x-ray photons generated by a laser heated plasma target. To detect the

characterisation of the magnetic transport system and calibration of the single

This is done by adding an attention based method that leverages spatio-temporal

of this work is the introduction of two cross attention blocks to effectively
model the spatial relations and capture short range temporal

studies how to colourise greyscale images (for restoration). Deep learning
techniques improved image colourisation yielding astonishing results. These
differ by various factors, such as structural differences, input types, user
assistance, etc. Most of them, base the architectural structure on
convolutional layers with no emphasis on layers specialised in object features
extraction. We introduce a novel downsampling upsampling architecture named
TUCaN (Tiny UCapsNet) that exploits the collaboration of convolutional layers
and capsule layers to obtain a neat colourisation of entities present in every
single image. This is obtained by enforcing collaboration among such layers by
skip and residual connections. We pose the problem as a per pixel colour
classification task that identifies colours as a bin in a quantized space. To
train the network, in contrast with the standard end to end learning method, we
propose the progressive learning scheme to extract the context of objects by
only manipulating the learning process without changing the model. In this
scheme, the upsampling starts from the reconstruction of low resolution images
and progressively grows to high resolution images throughout the training
phase. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets show that our approach
with ImageNet10k dataset outperforms existing methods on standard quality
metrics and achieves state of the art performances on image colourisation. We
performed a user study to quantify the perceptual realism of the colourisation
results demonstrating: that progressive learning let the TUCaN achieve better
colours than the end to end scheme; and pointing out the limitations of the
existing evaluation metrics.

nearly 60 years. A Dyson Sphere, a spherical structure that surrounds a star
and transports its radiative energy outward as an energy source for an advanced
civilisation, is one of the main targets of SETI. In this study, we discuss
whether building a Dyson Sphere around a black hole is effective. We consider
six energy sources: (i) the cosmic microwave background, (ii) the Hawking
radiation, (iii) an accretion disk, (iv) Bondi accretion, (v) a corona, and
(vi) relativistic jets. To develop future civilisations (for example, a Type II
civilisation), $4\times10^{26}\,{\rm W}$($1\,{\rm L_{\odot}}$) is expected to
be needed. Among (iii) to (vi), the largest luminosity can be collected from an
accretion disk, reaching $10^{5}\,{\rm L_{\odot}}$, enough to maintain a Type
II civilisation. Moreover, if a Dyson Sphere collects not only the
electromagnetic radiation but also other types of energy (e.g., kinetic energy)
from the jets, the total collected energy would be approximately 5 times
larger. Considering the emission from a Dyson Sphere, our results show that the
Dyson Sphere around a stellar-mass black hole in the Milky Way ($10\,\rm kpc$

approach for analyzing failure data from cloud systems, in order to relieve
human analysts from manually fine-tuning the data for feature engineering. The
approach leverages Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC), a family of unsupervised
clustering algorithms based on deep learning, which uses an autoencoder to
optimize data dimensionality and inter-cluster variance. We applied the
approach in the context of the OpenStack cloud computing platform, both on the
raw failure data and in combination with an anomaly detection pre-processing
algorithm. The results show that the performance of the proposed approach, in
terms of purity of clusters, is comparable to, or in some cases even better
than manually fine-tuned clustering, thus avoiding the need for deep domain
knowledge and reducing the effort to perform the analysis. In all cases, the
proposed approach provides better performance than unsupervised clustering when
no feature engineering is applied to the data. Moreover, the distribution of
failure modes from the proposed approach is closer to the actual frequency of
the failure modes.

show that this background produces a Higgs mechanism for the KK vector coming
from the $5D$ metric, which becomes massive by absorbing the string frame
radion. The $\mathcal{N}=2$ minimal supersymmetric extension of this model,

massless spectrum arranges into a $\mathcal{N}=1$, $D=4$ supersymmetric theory.
This projection is compatible with an orbifold which preserves half of the
original supersymmetries already preserved by the background. The description

not easy, and thus a lot of researches have been done to handle data with noisy

on the small-loss strategy which exploits the memorization effect. While it is
a powerful tool, the memorization effect has several drawbacks. The
performances are sensitive to the choice of a training epoch required for
utilizing the memorization effect. In addition, when the labels are heavily
contaminated or imbalanced, the memorization effect may not occur in which case
the methods based on the small-loss strategy fail to identify clean labeled
data. We introduce a new method called INN(Integration with the Nearest
Neighborhoods) to refine clean labeled data from training data with noisy
labels. The proposed method is based on a new discovery that a prediction
pattern at neighbor regions of clean labeled data is consistently different
from that of noisy labeled data regardless of training epochs. The INN method
requires more computation but is much stable and powerful than the small-loss
strategy. By carrying out various experiments, we demonstrate that the INN
method resolves the shortcomings in the memorization effect successfully and
thus is helpful to construct more accurate deep prediction models with training

reducing the original infinite dimensional dynamics to a simpler

applying a strong magnetic field, one can magnetize the structure to program
its deformation under the subsequent application of an external field. Hard
MREs, whose coercivities are large, have been receiving particular attention
because the programmed magnetization remains unchanged upon actuation. Hence,
once a structure made of a hard MRE is magnetized, it can be regarded as
magnetized permanently. Motivated by a new realm of applications, there have
been significant theoretical developments in the continuum description of hard
MREs. By reducing the 3D description into 1D or 2D via dimensional reduction,
several theories of hard magnetic slender structures such as linear beams,
elastica, and shells have been recently proposed. In this paper, we derive an
effective theory for MRE rods under geometrically nonlinear 3D deformation. Our
theory is based on reducing the 3D magneto-elastic energy functional for the
hard MREs into a 1D Kirchhoff-like description. Restricting the theory to 2D,
we reproduce previous works on planar deformations. For further validation in
the general case of 3D deformation, we perform precision experiments with both
naturally straight and curved rods under either constant or constant-gradient

blowups of the moduli space of curves. We supply a calculation scheme for the
virtual strict transforms, and deduce that toric contact cycles lie in the
tautological ring of the moduli space of curves. This is a higher dimensional
analogue of a result of Faber--Pandharipande. The operational Chow rings of
Artin fans play a basic role, and are shown to be isomorphic to rings of
piecewise polynomials on associated cone complexes. The ingredients in our

calculation in toric intersection theory is treated without logarithmic methods

evaluation have dramatically changed during the past decade and follow
concerning trends. An increasing number of MT evaluations exclusively rely on
differences between BLEU scores to draw conclusions, without performing any
kind of statistical significance testing nor human evaluation, while at least
108 metrics claiming to be better than BLEU have been proposed. MT evaluations
in recent papers tend to copy and compare automatic metric scores from previous
work to claim the superiority of a method or an algorithm without confirming
neither exactly the same training, validating, and testing data have been used
nor the metric scores are comparable. Furthermore, tools for reporting
standardized metric scores are still far from being widely adopted by the MT
community. After showing how the accumulation of these pitfalls leads to
dubious evaluation, we propose a guideline to encourage better automatic MT
evaluation along with a simple meta-evaluation scoring method to assess its
credibility.

tension should have, growing evidence has emerged pointing to the need for
models able to modify the expansion (and possibly thermal) history of the
universe both prior and after recombination, and that could thereby restore the
overall concordance between early- and late-time observations without
introducing nor worsening other cosmological tensions in the process. In
precisely this spirit, here we consider a multi-interacting dark energy model
with two complementary interaction channels: one with the dark matter and one
with the photons. The former most significantly affects the matter dominated
epoch as well as the very late universe, and has been shown to be able to
significantly resolve the $S_8$ tension. The latter has been introduced in this
work to allow for a larger and natural time dependence of the evolution of the
universe since it mostly impacts the radiation dominated epoch as well as the
temperature scaling of the photons, as extensively explained in the text. As a
result, considering data from Planck+BAO+Pantheon+KV450+DES (which can be
combined since the $S_8$ value is lowered even neglecting the weak lensing
data) we find that the significance of the $H_0$ tension only reduces to about
3.5$\sigma$, while that of the $S_8$ tension falls below the 2$\sigma$ level.
Also, the statistical analysis we perform strongly favors $\Lambda$CDM in all
considered cases. Overall, we conclude that the specific multi-interacting dark
energy model considered here, despite its broad generality and very rich
cosmological phenomenology, cannot successfully restore the aforementioned
overall concordance between early- and late-time observations.

on the existing turbine stock and use open data on technically feasible turbine

difficult due to fluctuating power consumption, unstable power supply coming

natural disasters. As the operation on the power grid must consider its impact
on future stability, reinforcement learning (RL) has been employed to provide
sequential decision-making in power grid management. However, existing methods
have not considered the environmental constraints. As a result, the learned
policy has risk of selecting actions that violate the constraints in
emergencies, which will escalate the issue of overloaded power lines and lead
to large-scale blackouts. In this work, we propose a novel method for this

planning stage, the search space is limited to the action set produced by the
policy. The selected action strictly follows the constraints by testing its
outcome with the simulation function provided by the system. At the learning
stage, to address the problem that gradients cannot be propagated to the

optimization to improve the policy directly, maximizing the returns of the long
run. In NeurIPS 2020 Learning to Run Power Network (L2RPN) competition, our

that iteratively reweighted least squares with weight strength $p = 0$ remains
a, theoretically and practically, particularly viable method denoted as
$\mathrm{IRLS}$-$0\mathcal{K}$. As in the matrix case, we prove global
convergence of asymptotic minimizers of the log-det sum-of-ranks function to

$\mathrm{IRLS}$-$0\mathcal{K}$ in dependence of the rate of decline of the

hierarchical families $\mathcal{K}$, we show how an alternating version

$\mathrm{SALSA}$) can be evaluated solely through tensor tree network based
operations. The method can thereby be applied to high dimensions through the
avoidance of exponential computational complexity. Further, the otherwise
crucial rank adaption process becomes essentially superfluous even for
completion problems. In numerical experiments, we show that the therefor
required subspace restrictions and relaxation of the affine constraint cause
only a marginal loss of approximation quality. On the other hand, we
demonstrate that $\mathrm{IRLS}$-$0\mathcal{K}$ allows to observe the

mobile devices in today's world. In recent studies, however, deep learning
models are shown vulnerable to adversarial examples. One variant of adversarial
examples, called adversarial patch, draws researchers' attention due to its
strong attack abilities. Though adversarial patches achieve high attack success
rates, they are easily being detected because of the visual inconsistency
between the patches and the original images. Besides, it usually requires a
large amount of data for adversarial patch generation in the literature, which
is computationally expensive and time-consuming. To tackle these challenges, we
propose an approach to generate inconspicuous adversarial patches with one
single image. In our approach, we first decide the patch locations basing on
the perceptual sensitivity of victim models, then produce adversarial patches
in a coarse-to-fine way by utilizing multiple-scale generators and
discriminators. The patches are encouraged to be consistent with the background
images with adversarial training while preserving strong attack abilities. Our
approach shows the strong attack abilities in white-box settings and the
excellent transferability in black-box settings through extensive experiments
on various models with different architectures and training methods. Compared
to other adversarial patches, our adversarial patches hold the most negligible
risks to be detected and can evade human observations, which is supported by
the illustrations of saliency maps and results of user evaluations. Lastly, we
show that our adversarial patches can be applied in the physical world.

improved mel-spectrograms, N-Singer uses a combination of Transformer-based

meaningful and practical task in which a model trained with data from several

adversarial learning is a promising domain generalization method that aims to
remove domain information in the latent representation through adversarial
training. However, in person re-identification, the domain and class are
correlated, and we theoretically show that domain adversarial learning will
lose certain information about class due to this domain-class correlation.
Inspired by casual inference, we propose to perform interventions to the domain
factor $d$, aiming to decompose the domain-class correlation. To achieve this
goal, we proposed estimating the resulting representation $z^{*}$ caused by the
intervention through first- and second-order statistical characteristic
matching. Specifically, we build a memory bank to restore the statistical
characteristics of each domain. Then, we use the newly generated samples
$\{z^{*},y,d^{*}\}$ to compute the loss function. These samples are
domain-class correlation decomposed; thus, we can learn a domain-invariant
representation that can capture more class-related features. Extensive

factorization (NMF) with the $\beta$-divergence objective function. Our new
updates are derived from a joint majorization-minimization (MM) scheme, in
which an auxiliary function (a tight upper bound of the objective function) is
built for the two factors jointly and minimized at each iteration. This is in
contrast with the classic approach in which a majorizer is derived for each
factor separately. Like that classic approach, our joint MM algorithm also
results in multiplicative updates that are simple to implement. They however
yield a significant drop of computation time (for equally good solutions), in
particular for some $\beta$-divergences of important applicative interest, such
as the squared Euclidean distance and the Kullback-Leibler or Itakura-Saito
divergences. We report experimental results using diverse datasets: face
images, an audio spectrogram, hyperspectral data and song play counts.
Depending on the value of $\beta$ and on the dataset, our joint MM approach can
yield CPU time reductions from about $13\%$ to $78\%$ in comparison to the
classic alternating scheme.

has great potentials in privacy preservation and in lowering the computation
load at the cloud. Recent work showed that FedAvg and FedProx - the two
widely-adopted FL algorithms - fail to reach the stationary points of the
global optimization objective even for homogeneous linear regression problems.
Further, it is concerned that the common model learned might not generalize
well locally at all in the presence of heterogeneity.
  In this paper, we analyze the convergence and statistical efficiency of
FedAvg and FedProx, addressing the above two concerns. Our analysis is based on
the standard non-parametric regression in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space
(RKHS), and allows for heterogeneous local data distributions and unbalanced
local datasets. We prove that the estimation errors, measured in either the
empirical norm or the RKHS norm, decay with a rate of 1/t in general and
exponentially for finite-rank kernels. In certain heterogeneous settings, these
upper bounds also imply that both FedAvg and FedProx achieve the optimal error
rate. To further analytically quantify the impact of the heterogeneity at each
client, we propose and characterize a novel notion-federation gain, defined as
the reduction of the estimation error for a client to join the FL. We discover
that when the data heterogeneity is moderate, a client with limited local data
can benefit from a common model with a large federation gain. Numerical
experiments further corroborate our theoretical findings.

understanding and improvement. Current evaluation of an NMT system is usually
built upon a heuristic decoding algorithm (e.g., beam search) and an evaluation
metric assessing similarity between the translation and golden reference.
However, this system-level evaluation framework is limited by evaluating only
one best hypothesis and search errors brought by heuristic decoding algorithms.
To better understand NMT models, we propose a novel evaluation protocol, which
defines model errors with model's ranking capability over hypothesis space. To
tackle the problem of exponentially large space, we propose two approximation
methods, top region evaluation along with an exact top-$k$ decoding algorithm,
which finds top-ranked hypotheses in the whole hypothesis space, and Monte
Carlo sampling evaluation, which simulates hypothesis space from a broader
perspective. To quantify errors, we define our NMT model errors by measuring
distance between the hypothesis array ranked by the model and the ideally
ranked hypothesis array. After confirming the strong correlation with human
judgment, we apply our evaluation to various NMT benchmarks and model
architectures. We show that the state-of-the-art Transformer models face
serious ranking issues and only perform at the random chance level in the top
region. We further analyze model errors on architectures with different depths
and widths, as well as different data-augmentation techniques, showing how
these factors affect model errors. Finally, we connect model errors with the
search algorithms and provide interesting findings of beam search inductive
bias and correlation with Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding.

indexes for evaluating the performance of the parameter estimation methods.
However, a common characteristic of these indexes is that they are unsupervised
indexes, and are passively used for evaluating the estimation results. In other
words, these indexes cannot participate in the design of estimation methods. It
seems that exploiting a validity supervised index for the parameter estimation
that can guide the design of the methods will be an interesting and meaningful
work. In this study, we exploit an index to build a supervised learning model
of the parameter estimation. With the developed model we refine the signal
subspace so as to enhance the performance of the parameter estimation method.
The main characteristic of the proposed model is a circularly applied feedback
of the estimated parameter for refining the estimated subspace. It is a closed
loop and supervised method not reported before. This research opens a specific
way for improving the performance of the parameter estimation by a supervised

Therefore, continuous observations of physical leakages are essential to
minimise vulnerabilities associated with cryptographic functions. Lightweight
cryptography is a novel approach in progress towards internet-of-things (IoT)
security. Thus, it would provide sufficient data and privacy protection in such
a constrained ecosystem. IoT devices are resource-limited in terms of data
rates (in kbps), power maintainability (battery) as well as hardware and
software footprints (physical size, internal memory, RAM/ROM). Due to the
difficulty in handling conventional cryptographic algorithms, lightweight
ciphers consist of small key sizes, block sizes and few operational rounds.
Unlike in the past, affordability to perform side-channel attacks using
inexpensive electronic circuitries is becoming a reality. Hence, cryptanalysis
of physical leakage in these emerging ciphers is crucial. Among existing
studies, power analysis seems to have enough attention in research, whereas
other aspects such as electromagnetic, timing, cache and optical attacks
continue to be appropriately evaluated to play a role in forensic analysis.
  As a result, we started analysing electromagnetic emission leakage of an
ultra-lightweight block cipher, PRESENT. According to the literature, PRESENT
promises to be adequate for IoT devices, and there still seems not to exist any
work regarding correlation electromagnetic analysis (CEMA) of it. Firstly, we
conducted simple electromagnetic analysis in both time and frequency domains
and then proceeded towards CEMA attack modelling. This paper provides a summary
of the related literature (IoT, lightweight cryptography, side-channel attacks
and EMA), our methodology, current outcomes and future plans for the optimised

control theory and implementation of model predictive control (MPC) for robotic
systems operating on manifolds. We propose a generic on-manifold MPC
formulation based on a canonical representation of the system evolving on
manifolds. Then, we present a method that solves the on-manifold MPC
formulation by linearizing the system along the trajectory under tracking.
There are two main advantages of the proposed scheme. The first is that the
linearized system leads to an equivalent error system represented by a set of
minimal parameters without any singularity. Secondly, the process of system
modeling, error-system derivation, linearization and control has the manifold
constraints completely decoupled from the system descriptions, enabling the
development of a symbolic MPC framework that naturally encapsulates the
manifold constraints. In this framework, users need only to supply
system-specific descriptions without dealing with the manifold constraints. We
implement this framework and test it on a quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV) operating on $SO(3) \times \mathbb{R}^n$ and an unmanned ground vehicle
(UGV) moving on a curved surface. Real-world experiments show that the proposed
framework and implementation achieve high tracking performance and
computational efficiency even in highly aggressive aerobatic quadrotor
maneuvers.

$(1+\epsilon)$-spanner with constant bounds on its maximum degree and its
lightness using only 2-hop neighborhood information. This immediately improves
the best prior lightness bound, the algorithm of Damian, Pandit, and Pemmaraju,
which runs in $\mathcal{O}(\log^*n)$ rounds in the LOCAL model, but has a
$\mathcal{O}(\log \Delta)$ bound on its lightness, where $\Delta$ is the ratio
of the length of the longest edge to the length of the shortest edge in the
unit ball graph. Next, we adjust our algorithm to work in the CONGEST model,
without changing its round complexity, hence proposing the first spanner
construction for unit ball graphs in the CONGEST model of computation. We
further study the problem in the two dimensional Euclidean plane and we provide
a construction with similar properties that has a constant average number of

topological structure and mathematical relation. The colorings and labelings of
graph theory are main techniques in topological coding applied in asymmetric

advantages: (1) Run fast in communication networks because they are saved in
computer by popular matrices rather than pictures. (2) Produce easily
text-based (number-based) strings for encrypt files. (3) Diversity of
asymmetric ciphers, one public-key corresponds to more private-keys, or more
public-keys correspond more private-keys. (4) Irreversibility, Topsnut-gpws can
generate quickly text-based (number-based) strings with bytes as long as
desired, but these strings can not reconstruct the original Topsnut-gpws. (5)
Computational security, since there are many non-polynomial (NP-complete,
NP-hard) algorithms in creating Topsnut-gpws. (6) Provable security, since
there are many mathematical conjectures (open problems) in graph labelings and
graph colorings. We are committed to create more kinds of new Topsnut-gpws to
approximate practical applications and antiquantum computation, and try to use
algebraic method and Topsnut-gpws to establish graphic group, graphic lattice,

temporally localize and recognize the human action in untrimmed videos. Current
mainstream one-stage TAD approaches localize and classify action proposals
relying on pre-defined anchors, where the location and scale for action

limits its generalization capability and will lead to performance degradation
when videos contain rich action variation. In this study, we explore to remove
the requirement of pre-defined anchors for TAD methods. A novel TAD model
termed as Selective Receptive Field Network (SRF-Net) is developed, in which
the location offsets and classification scores at each temporal location can be
directly estimated in the feature map and SRF-Net is trained in an end-to-end

Cosmic Explorer sites, the Einstein Telescope, and continued observation with
the existing second generation ground-based detectors. For a fiducial local
merger rate of 300 Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, we find that the Einstein Telescope on
its own is able to detect 6 and 2 sources per year at 5 and 30 minutes before
merger, respectively, while providing a localization of $<10~\textrm{deg}^2$. A
single Cosmic Explorer would detect but be unable to localize sources on its
own. A two-detector Cosmic Explorer network, however, would detect 22 and 0.4

the operation of dual Cosmic Explorers and the Einstein Telescope would allow
for $<1~\textrm{deg}^2$ source localization at 5 minutes before merger for
$\sim7$ sources per year. Given the dramatic increase in localization and
detection capabilities, third generation observatories will enable the regular
observation of the prompt emission of mergers by a broad array of observatories

curved differential graded algebra and define a new ``zigzag algebra'' that,
informally, consists of algebra elements arranged on a zigzag of intervals
going back and forth between $0$ and $1$. We focus on two curved differential
graded algebras: the de Rham algebra of differential forms with values in the
endomorphism bundle associated to a vector bundle with connection, and its
induced zigzag algebra. We define a curved version of Chen's iterated integral
that incorporates parallel transport and maps this zigzag algebra of
bundle-valued forms to bundle-valued forms on the path space. This iterated
integral is proven to be a homotopy equivalence of curved differential graded
algebras, and for real-valued forms it factors through the usual Chen iterated
integral.

kinematics shows two components: (i) a rotating disc with kinematic position

sequentially adding new classes. However, continual learning methods are
usually prone to catastrophic forgetting. This issue is further aggravated in
CSS where, at each step, old classes from previous iterations are collapsed
into the background. In this paper, we propose Local POD, a multi-scale pooling
distillation scheme that preserves long- and short-range spatial relationships
at feature level. Furthermore, we design an entropy-based pseudo-labelling of
the background w.r.t. classes predicted by the old model to deal with
background shift and avoid catastrophic forgetting of the old classes. Finally,
we introduce a novel rehearsal method that is particularly suited for
segmentation. Our approach, called PLOP, significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in existing CSS scenarios, as well as in newly

developing a source-by-source, Monte Carlo-based forward model for the Shapiro
time delays by combining constrained realisations of the local density field
using the Bayesian origin reconstruction from galaxies algorithm with
unconstrained large-scale modes. Propagating uncertainties in the density field
reconstruction and marginalising over an empirical model describing other

or overfitting in the presence of noisily-labelled data. For the problem of
robust learning under such noisy data, several algorithms have been proposed. A
prominent class of algorithms rely on sample selection strategies wherein,
essentially, a fraction of samples with loss values below a certain threshold
are selected for training. These algorithms are sensitive to such thresholds,
and it is difficult to fix or learn these thresholds. Often, these algorithms
also require information such as label noise rates which are typically
unavailable in practice. In this paper, we propose an adaptive sample selection
strategy that relies only on batch statistics of a given mini-batch to provide
robustness against label noise. The algorithm does not have any additional
hyperparameters for sample selection, does not need any information on noise
rates and does not need access to separate data with clean labels. We
empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on benchmark
datasets.

virtualities and making contact with perturbation theory enables a precision
determination of the electromagnetic coupling at the $Z$ pole, which enters
global electroweak fits. In order to achieve this goal ab initio using lattice
QCD, one faces the challenge that, at the short distances which dominate the
observable, discretization errors are hard to control. Here we address
challenges of this type with the help of static screening correlators in the
high-temperature phase of QCD, yet without incurring any bias. The idea is
motivated by the observations that (a) the cost of high-temperature simulations
is typically much lower than their vacuum counterpart, and (b) at distances
$x_3$ far below the inverse temperature $1/T$, the operator-product expansion
guarantees the thermal correlator of two local currents to deviate from the
vacuum correlator by a relative amount that is power-suppressed in $(x_3\:T)$.
The method is first investigated in lattice perturbation theory, where we point
out the appearance of an O$(a^2 \log(1/a))$ lattice artifact in the vacuum
polarization with a prefactor that we calculate. It is then applied to
non-perturbative lattice QCD data with two dynamical flavors of quarks. Our
lattice spacings range down to 0.049 fm for the vacuum simulations and down to
0.033 fm for the simulations performed at a temperature of 250 MeV.

that the data is inherently structured as a sparse superposition of basic
building blocks. Similarly, neural networks perform a given task by learning
features of the training data set. Recently both data-driven and model-driven
feature extracting methods have become extremely popular and have achieved
remarkable results. Nevertheless, practical implementations are often too slow
to be employed in real-life scenarios, especially for real-time applications.
We propose a speed-up upgraded version of the classic iterative thresholding
algorithm, that produces a good approximation of the convolutional sparse code
within 2-5 iterations. The speed advantage is gained mostly from the
observation that most solvers are slowed down by inefficient global
thresholding. The main idea is to normalize each data point by the local
receptive field energy, before applying a threshold. This way, the natural
inclination towards strong feature expressions is suppressed, so that one can
rely on a global threshold that can be easily approximated, or learned during
training. The proposed algorithm can be employed with a known predetermined
dictionary, or with a trained dictionary. The trained version is implemented as
a neural net designed as the unfolding of the proposed solver. The performance
of the proposed solution is demonstrated via the seismic inversion problem in
both synthetic and real data scenarios. We also provide theoretical guarantees
for a stable support recovery. Namely, we prove that under certain conditions
the true support is perfectly recovered within the first iteration.

altered compared to the outcome of single size models. In order to understand
the outcome of the multi-species streaming instability in detail, we perform a
large parameter study in terms of particle number, particle size distribution,
particle size range, initial metallicity and initial particle scale height. We
study vertically stratified systems and determine the metallicity threshold for
filament formation. We compare these with a system where the initial particle
distribution is unstratified and find that its evolution follows that of its
stratified counterpart. We find that change in particle number does not result
in significant variation in the efficiency and timing of filament formation. We
also see that there is no clear trend for how varying the size distribution in
combination with particle size range changes the outcome of the multi-species
streaming instability. Finally, we find that an initial metallicity of
$Z_{\rm{init}}=0.005$ and $Z_{\rm{init}}=0.01$ both result in similar critical
metallicity values for the start of filament formation. Our results show that
the inclusion of a particle size distribution into streaming instability
simulations, while changing the dynamics as compared to mono-disperse systems,
does not result in overall unfavorable conditions for solid growth. We
attribute the sub-dominant role of multiple species to the high-density

the bound on data leakage and can be seen as consuming part of a global privacy

be carefully managed to maximize the number of successfully trained models.
  We describe PrivateKube, an extension to the popular Kubernetes datacenter
orchestrator that adds privacy as a new type of resource to be managed
alongside other traditional compute resources, such as CPU, GPU, and memory.
The abstractions we design for the privacy resource mirror those defined by
Kubernetes for traditional resources, but there are also major differences. For
example, traditional compute resources are replenishable while privacy is not:
a CPU can be regained after a model finishes execution while privacy budget
cannot. This distinction forces a re-design of the scheduler. We present DPF
(Dominant Private Block Fairness) -- a variant of the popular Dominant Resource
Fairness (DRF) algorithm -- that is geared toward the non-replenishable privacy
resource but enjoys similar theoretical properties as DRF.

SNe Ia and very dim SNe Ia such as 91bg-like SNe. Its peculiarity is that two
late-time spectra taken at +84 and +142 days after the peak show a narrow line
of Halpha (with full width at half-maximum of ~650 and 1000 kms-1,
respectively). This is the third low-luminosity and fast-declining Type Ia SN

an expanding hydrogen-rich shell (with velocity < 1000 kms-1). The hydrogen
shell velocity is too high to be produced during a common envelope phase, while
it may be consistent with some material stripped from an H-rich companion star
in a single-degenerate progenitor system. However, the derived mass of this
stripped hydrogen is ~0.002-0.003 Msun, which is much less than that expected
(>0.1 Msun) for standard models for these scenarios. Another plausible sequence
of events is a weak SN ejecta interaction with a H-shell ejected by optically
thick winds or a nova-like eruption on the C/O WD progenitor some years before
the supernova explosion.

sensing problem in which the measurements only contain magnitude information.
In this paper, motivated by recent advances in deep generative models, we
provide recovery guarantees with near-optimal sample complexity for phase
retrieval with generative priors. We first show that when using i.i.d. Gaussian
measurements and an $L$-Lipschitz continuous generative model with bounded
$k$-dimensional inputs, roughly $O(k \log L)$ samples suffice to guarantee that
any signal minimizing an amplitude-based empirical loss function is close to
the true signal. Attaining this sample complexity with a practical algorithm
remains a difficult challenge, and finding a good initialization for
gradient-based methods has been observed to pose a major bottleneck. To
partially address this, we further show that roughly $O(k \log L)$ samples
ensure sufficient closeness between the underlying signal and any {\em globally
optimal} solution to an optimization problem designed for spectral
initialization (though finding such a solution may still be challenging). We
also adapt this result to sparse phase retrieval, and show that $O(s \log n)$
samples are sufficient for a similar guarantee when the underlying signal is

propose a practical spectral initialization method motivated by our findings,
and experimentally observe performance gains over various existing spectral
initialization methods for sparse phase retrieval.

open yet essential problem to characterize the origin of the adversarial
vulnerability of a multi-label learning system and assess its attackability. In
this study, we focus on non-targeted evasion attack against multi-label
classifiers. The goal of the threat is to cause miss-classification with
respect to as many labels as possible, with the same input perturbation. Our
work gains in-depth understanding about the multi-label adversarial attack by
first characterizing the transferability of the attack based on the functional
properties of the multi-label classifier. We unveil how the transferability
level of the attack determines the attackability of the classifier via
establishing an information-theoretic analysis of the adversarial risk.
Furthermore, we propose a transferability-centered attackability assessment,
named Soft Attackability Estimator (SAE), to evaluate the intrinsic
vulnerability level of the targeted multi-label classifier. This estimator is
then integrated as a transferability-tuning regularization term into the
multi-label learning paradigm to achieve adversarially robust classification.
The experimental study on real-world data echos the theoretical analysis and
verify the validity of the transferability-regularized multi-label learning
method.

significantly improve the text recognition accuracy over existing STISR

own Boolean function for computing its state according to the configuration of
the network. The updating mode then determines how the configuration of the
network evolves over time. Many of updating modes from the literature,
including synchronous and asynchronous modes, can be defined as the composition
of elementary deterministic configuration updates, i.e., by functions mapping
configurations of the network. Nevertheless, alternative dynamics have been
introduced using ad-hoc auxiliary objects, such as that resulting from binary
projections of Memory Boolean networks, or that resulting from additional
pseudo-states for Most Permissive Boolean networks. One may wonder whether
these latter dynamics can still be classified as updating modes of finite
Boolean networks, or belong to a different class of dynamical systems. In this
paper, we study the extension of updating modes to the composition of
non-deterministic updates, i.e., mapping sets of finite configurations. We show
that the above dynamics can be expressed in this framework, enabling a better
understanding of them as updating modes of Boolean networks. More generally, we
argue that non-deterministic updates pave the way to a unifying framework for
expressing complex updating modes, some of them enabling transitions that
cannot be computed with elementary and non-elementary deterministic updates.

reinforcement learning provides effective means to address myopia by estimating
how much discounted cumulated future reward states promise. In this work, we
leverage deep reinforcement learning to accelerate the learning of concepts in

By virtue of its architecture, DRILL is able to compute the expected discounted
cumulated future reward of more than $10^3$ class expressions in a second on
standard hardware. We evaluate DRILL on four benchmark datasets against

digraphs, called structurally observable graphs (SOGs), and to solve two
minimum realization problems. To begin with, by exploring structural
observability of large-scale Boolean networks (LSBNs), an underlying type of
SOGs is provided based on a recent observability criterion of conjunctive BNs.
Besides, SOGs are also proved to have important applicability to structural
observability of general discrete-time systems. Further, two minimum
realization strategies are considered to induce an SOG from an arbitrarily
given digraph by marking and controlling the minimal vertices, respectively. It
indicates that one can induce an observable system by means of adding the
minimal sensors or modifying the adjacency relation of minimal vertices.
Finally, the structural observability of finite-field networks, and the minimum
pinned node theorem for Boolean networks are displayed as application and
simulation. The most salient superiority is that the designed algorithms are
polynomial time and avoid exhaustive brute-force searches. It means that our
results can be applied to deal with the observability of large-scale systems
(particularly, LSBNs), whose observability analysis and the minimum controlled

evolutionary sequences of stars with initial masses $5.7M_\odot\le M_0\le
7.2M_\odot$ and $Z=0.014$, 0.018, 0.022. For considered values of $Z$ the
periods of the fundamental mode and the first overtone at the oscillation mode
switching are shown to depend on the mean density of the stellar matter. The
upper limit of the period of the first overtone decreases witn increasing $Z$
from $\approx 6.9$ day for $Z=0.014$ to $\approx 4.1$ day for $Z=0.022$. The
theoretical period--radius relation is independent of $Z$ and agrees well
(within 2.5\%) with recent measurements of Cepheid radii based on the
Baade--Wesselink method. The fundamental parameters of the short--period
Cepheid CG Cas were derived with application of observational estimates of the

localization (FMBL). In this work, we find that disorder generates drastic
effects on the system, i.e., addition of it induces a thermal phase first and
further increase of it leads the system to the conventional many-body-localized
(MBL) phase. The competition gives novel localization properties and
unconventional quench dynamics to the system. We first draw the global sketch
of the localization phase diagram by focusing on the two-particle system. The
thermal phase intrudes between the FMBL and MBL phases, the regime of which
depends on the strength of disorder and interactions. Based on the two-particle

finite-filling cases in detail. At finite-filling fractions, we again find that
the interplay/competition between the interactions and disorder in the original

scalars $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_0^*$ as well as their axial-vector partner
states can all be understood as emerging from the interactions between
Goldstone bosons stemming from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and
the ground state charmed mesons. For that purpose we exploit the flavor
multiplet structure of the lightest open-charm positive-parity scalar states in
an SU(3) symmetric lattice QCD simulation at large pion masses to establish
that there exists a bound state in the flavor-sextet representation, which
cannot emerge for quark-antiquark states but appears naturally for four-quark
configurations. Moreover, we find repulsion in the $[15]$ representation and
thus no single-particle state in this representation exists, falsifying the
expectation for tetraquark models. The findings establish the pattern predicted
for the interactions of Goldstone bosons with $D$ mesons from chiral symmetry

since it is generally difficult to sample abundant paired LR-HR MR images, the
classical fully supervised DL-based models cannot be effectively trained to get
robust performance. To this end, we propose a novel Two-stage Self-supervised
Cycle-consistency Network (TSCNet) for MR slice interpolation, in which a
two-stage self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy is developed for unsupervised
DL network training. The paired LR-HR images are synthesized along the sagittal

first-stage SSL, and then a cyclic in-terpolation procedure based on triplet
axial slices is designed in the second-stage SSL for further refinement. More
training samples with rich contexts along all directions are exploited as
guidance to guarantee the improved in-terpolation performance. Moreover, a new
cycle-consistency constraint is proposed to supervise this cyclic procedure,
which encourages the network to reconstruct more realistic HR images. The
experimental results on a real MRI dataset indicate that TSCNet achieves
superior performance over the conventional and other SSL-based algorithms, and

this sequential scheme does not ensure these two tasks fully benefit each

constellations with tuples of matchings.
  We consider a one parameter deformation of the generating series of

$c^\lambda_{\mu^0,...,\mu^k}(b)$ obtained by the expansion of these functions
in the power-sum basis. These coefficients are indexed by $k+2$ integer
partitions and the deformation parameter $b$, and can be considered as a
generalization for $k\geq1$ of the connection coefficients introduced by
Goulden and Jackson. We prove that when we take some marginal sums, these
coefficients enumerate $b$-weighted $k$-tuples of matchings. This can be seen
as an ""unrooted"" version of a recent result of Chapuy and Do{\l}\k{e}ga for
constellations. For $k=1$, this gives a partial answer to Goulden and Jackson

  Lassale has formulated a positivity conjecture for the coefficients

2019 March 8 in active region AR 12734, to which we refer as the International
Women's day event. The event under study is intriguing in several aspects: 1)
low-coronal eruptive signatures come in ''pairs'' (a double-peak flare, two
coronal dimmings, and two EUV waves); 2) although the event is characterized by
a complete chain of eruptive signatures, the corresponding coronagraphic
signatures are weak; 3) although the source region of the eruption is located
close to the center of the solar disc and the eruption is thus presumably
Earth-directed, heliospheric signatures are very weak with little Earth-impact.
We analyze a number of multi-spacecraft and multi-instrument (both
remote-sensing and in situ) observations, including Soft X-ray, (extreme-)
ultraviolet (E)UV), radio and white-light emission, as well as plasma, magnetic
field and particle measurements. We employ 3D NLFF modeling to investigate the
coronal magnetic field configuration in and around the active region, the GCS
model to make a 3D reconstruction of the CME geometry and the 3D MHD numerical
model EUHFORIA to model the background state of the heliosphere. Our results
indicate two subsequent eruptions of two systems of sheared and twisted
magnetic fields, which merge already in the upper corona and start to evolve
further out as a single entity. The large-scale magnetic field significantly

During the first eruption the stability of the overlying field was disrupted
which enabled the second eruption. We find that during the propagation in the
interplanetary space the large-scale magnetic field, i.e. , the location of
heliospheric current sheet between the AR and the Earth likely influences
propagation and the evolution of the erupted structure(s).

much sparser than a spike rate-based system. Our modified temporal loss
function called 'Aggressive TTFS' improves the inference time of the network by
over 33% and reduces the number of spikes in the network by more than 11%

on the MNIST dataset using this approach, we can generate high quality samples.
Thereby demonstrating the potential of this framework for solving such problems

Based on this observation, we develop a simple deterministic approximation for

that the approximation error goes to zero as the dimension increases, under a

modularity maximization. Although modularity maximization is a general
framework that can be modified and reparamaterized to address domain-specific

been narrow. Here, we highlight several strategies in which the
``out-of-the-box'' version of modularity maximization can be extended to
address questions specific to neuroscience. First, we present approaches for
detecting ``space-independent'' modules and for applying modularity
maximization to signed matrices. Next, we show that the modularity maximization

Finally, we highlight the role of multi-layer models in detecting and tracking
modules across time, tasks, subjects, and modalities. In summary, modularity
maximization is a flexible and general framework that can be adapted to detect
modular structure resulting from a wide range of hypotheses. This article
highlights opens multiple frontiers for future research and applications.

flagella, making them the only known organism to use rotation as a means of
propulsion. The rotation is supplied by the bacterial flagellar motor, a
particularly powerful rotary molecular machine. At the base of each flagellum
is the hook, a soft helical polymer that acts as a universal joint, coupling
rotation of the rigid membrane-spanning rotor to rotation of the rigid
extra-cellular flagellum. In multi-flagellated bacterial species, where thrust
is provided by a hydrodynamically coordinated bundle of flagella, the
flexibility of the hook is particularly crucial, as many of the flagella within
the bundle rotate significantly off-axis from their motor. But, consequently,
the thrust produced by a single rotating flagellum applies a significant
bending moment to the hook. So, the hook needs to simultaneously provide the
compliance necessary for off-axis bundle formation and the rigidity necessary
to withstand the large hydrodynamical forces of swimming. To elucidate how the
hook can fulfill this double functionality, measurements of the mechanical
behavior of individual hooks under dynamical conditions are needed. Here, via
new high-resolution measurements and a novel analysis of hook fluctuations
during in vivo motor rotation in bead assays, we resolve the elastic response
of single hooks under increasing torsional stress, revealing a clear dynamic
increase in their bending stiffness. Accordingly, the persistence length of the
hook increases by more than one order of magnitude with applied torque. Such
strain-stiffening allows the system to be flexible when needed yet reduce
deformation under high loads, allowing cellular motility at high speed.

designed to enable analysis of the diagrams using tools from functional data
analysis. They comprise a collection of scalar functions such that birth and
death times of topological features in persistence diagrams map to extrema of
functions and intervals where they are non-zero. As a consequence, variation in
persistence diagrams is encoded in both amplitude and phase components of
persistence landscapes. Through functional data analysis of persistence
landscapes, under an elastic Riemannian metric, we show how meaningful
statistical summaries of persistence landscapes (e.g., mean, dominant
directions of variation) can be obtained by decoupling their amplitude and
phase variations. This decoupling is achieved via optimal alignment, with
respect to the elastic metric, of the persistence landscapes. The estimated
phase functions are tied to the resolution parameter that determines the
filtration of simplicial complexes used to construct persistence diagrams. For
a dataset obtained under geometric, scale and sampling variabilities, the phase
function prescribes an optimal rate of increase of the resolution parameter for
enhancing the topological signal in a persistence diagram. The proposed
approach adds substantially to the statistical analysis of data objects with
rich structure compared to past studies. In particular, we focus on two sets of

parameters, exploiting over $10^6$ ${\rm e^+e^- \to ZH}$ events and almost
$10^5$ ${\rm WW \to H}$ events at centre-of-mass energies around 240 and 365
GeV. This essay spotlights the important measurements of the ZH production
cross section and of the Higgs boson mass. The measurement of the total ZH
cross section is an essential input to the absolute determination of the HZZ
coupling -- a ""standard candle"" that can be used by all other measurements,
including those made at hadron colliders -- at the per-mil level. A combination
of the measured cross sections at the two different centre-of-mass energies
further provides the first evidence for the trilinear Higgs self-coupling, and
possibly its first observation if the cross-section measurement can be made
accurate enough. The determination of the Higgs boson mass with a precision
significantly better than the Higgs boson width (4.1 MeV in the Standard Model)
is a prerequisite to either constrain or measure the electron Yukawa coupling
via direct ${\rm e^+e^- \to H}$ production at $\sqrt{s} = 125$ GeV. Approaching
the statistical limit of 0.1% and $\mathcal{O}(1)$ MeV on the ZH cross section
and the Higgs boson mass, respectively, sets highly demanding requirements on
accelerator operation (ZH threshold scan, centre-of-mass energy measurement),
detector design (lepton momentum resolution, hadronic final state
reconstruction performance), theoretical calculations, and analysis techniques
(efficiency and purity optimization with modern tools, constrained kinematic
fits, control of systematic uncertainties). These challenges are examined in
turn in this essay.

last few years and they are foreseen as a cornerstone for the next generations
of mobile communication systems. Despite opening up new market opportunities
and use cases for the future, the novel impairments caused by the signal
propagation over the NTN channel compromises several procedures of the current
cellular standards. One of the first and most important procedures impacted is
the random access (RA) procedure, which is mainly utilized for achieving uplink
synchronization among users in several standards, such as the fourth and fifth
generation of mobile communication (4 & 5G) and narrowband internet of things
(NB-IoT). In this work, we analyse the challenges imposed by the considerably
increased delay in the communication link on the RA procedure and propose new
solutions to overcome those challenges. A trade-off analysis of various
solutions is provided taking into account also the already existing ones in the
literature. In order to broaden the scope of applicability, we keep the
analysis general targeting 4G, 5G and NB-IoT systems since the RA procedure is
quasi-identical among these technologies. Last but not least, we go one step
further and validate our techniques in an experimental setup, consisting of a
user and a base station implemented in open air interface (OAI), and an NTN
channel implemented in hardware that emulates the signal propagation delay. The
laboratory test-bed built in this work, not only enables us to validate various
solutions, but also plays a crucial role in identifying novel challenges not
previously treated in the literature. Finally, an important key performance
indicator (KPI) of the RA procedure over NTN is shown, which is the time that a
single user requires to establish a connection with the base station.

this amount to the post first dredge-up stars of NGC~104 we were able to infer
the initial Li of this cluster. Moreover, we compared our observational results

initial Li abundance and that after the first dredge-up. The initial lithium

abundance measured from the five hottest stars with the highest lithium
abundance. This value is 1.69 dex higher than the lithium abundance derived in
post first dredge-up stars. By adding this number to the lithium abundance
derived in the post first dredge-up stars in NGC~104, we infer a lower limit of
its initial lithium content of A(Li)_i= 2.30dex. Stellar models predict similar

observations, much work has been done on the detection of stellar radio
emission at low frequencies. Such emission has commonly been shown to be
coherent emission, generally attributed to electron-cyclotron maser emission,
and has usually been detected from main-sequence M dwarfs. Here we report the
first detection of coherent emission at low frequencies from T Tauri stars,
which are known to be associated with high levels of stellar activity. Using
LOFAR, we have detected several bright radio bursts at 150 MHz from two
weak-line T Tauri stars: KPNO-Tau 14 and LkCa 4. All of the bursts have high
brightness temperatures ($10^{13} - 10^{14}\ \mathrm{K}$) and high circular
polarization fractions (60 - 90 \%), indicating that they must be due to a
coherent emission mechanism. This could be either plasma emission or
electron-cyclotron maser (ECM) emission. Due to the exceptionally high
brightness temperatures seen in at least one of the bursts ($\geq 10^{14}\
\mathrm{K}$), and the high circular polarization levels, it seems unlikely that
plasma emission could be the source and so ECM is favoured as the most likely
emission mechanism. Assuming this is the case, the required magnetic field in
the emission regions would be 40 - 70 G. We determine that the most likely
method of generating ECM emission is plasma co-rotation breakdown in the
stellar magnetosphere. There remains the possibility, however, it could be due
to an interaction with an orbiting exoplanet.

logarithmic growth in the intermediate times. Moreover, for adjacent intervals
we find that the LN is zero for times $t < \beta/2$ (half of the inverse
temperature) and after that, it begins to grow linearly. For disjoint intervals
at fixed temperature, the vanishing of LN is observed for times $t<d/2$ (half
of the distance between intervals). We also find a similar delay to see linear

  Networks","Accepted by IEEE wireless communication magazine",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided networks have been
investigated for the purpose of improving the system performance. However, the
introduced unit modulus phase shifts and coupling characteristic bring enormous
challenges to the optimization in the RIS-aided networks. Many efforts have
been made to jointly optimize phase shift vector and other parameters. This
article intends to survey the latest research results about the optimization in
RIS-aided networks. A taxonomy is devised to categorize the existing
literatures based on optimization types, phase shift form, and decoupling
methods. Furthermore, in alternating optimization framework, we introduce in
detail how to exploit the aforementioned technologies flexibly. It is known
that most works could not guarantee a stationary point. To overcome this
problem, we propose a unified framework for the optimization problem of
RIS-aided networks with continuous phase shifts to find a stationary point.
Finally, key challenges are outlined to provide guidelines for the domain
researchers and designers to explore more efficient optimization frameworks,
and then open issues are discussed.

concerning beyond the Standard Model searches at FCC-ee, such as rare decays of
heavy-flavoured particles and long-lived particles. The Standard Model contains
several suppression mechanisms, which cause a given group of processes to
happen rarely, resulting in rare decays. The interest in these decays lies in
the fact that the physics beyond the Standard Model does not need to be
affected by the same suppression mechanism and therefore can naturally manifest
in these decays. Their interest is reinforced by the recent report of several
measurements of $b$-flavoured rare decays, showing deviations with respect to
the Standard Model predictions. We will show how the FCC-ee project has unique
capabilities to address these scientific questions and will consider the
related detector design challenges to meet. Another group of processes
discussed are those that produce new particles with relatively long lifetimes,
that travel substantial distances inside the detectors before decaying. Models
containing long-lived particles can give answers to many open questions of the
Standard Model, such as the nature of dark matter, or the neutrino masses,
among others; while providing an interesting experimental complement to
mainstream searches. Long-lived particles often display unique experimental
signatures, such as displaced tracks and vertices, disappearing tracks, or
anomalously charged jets. Due to this, they are affected by very low background
levels but in exchange, they often require dedicated reconstruction algorithms
and triggers.

fractionalized degrees of freedom coupled to gauge fields requires a precise
determination of the fixed point structure from the field theoretical side, and
an extreme sensitivity to weak first-order transitions from the numerical side.
Addressing the latter, we revive the classic definition of the order parameter
in the limit of a vanishing external field at the transition. We demonstrate
that this widely understood, yet so far unused approach provides a diagnostic
test for first-order versus continuous behavior that is distinctly more
sensitive than current methods. We first apply it to the family of $Q$-state
Potts models, where the nature of the transition is continuous for $Q\leq4$ and
turns (weakly) first order for $Q>4$, using an infinite system matrix product
state implementation. We then employ this new approach to address the unsettled
question of deconfined quantum criticality in the $S=1/2$ N\'eel to valence
bond solid transition in two dimensions, focusing on the square lattice $J$-$Q$
model. Our quantum Monte Carlo simulations reveal that both order parameters
remain finite at the transition, directly confirming a first-order scenario
with wide reaching implications in condensed matter and quantum field theory.

  Learning",,,,,"cs.AI cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Electronic health record (EHR) coding is the task of assigning ICD codes to
each EHR. Most previous studies either only focus on the frequent ICD codes or
treat rare and frequent ICD codes in the same way. These methods perform well
on frequent ICD codes but due to the extremely unbalanced distribution of ICD
codes, the performance on rare ones is far from satisfactory. We seek to
improve the performance for both frequent and rare ICD codes by using a
contrastive graph-based EHR coding framework, CoGraph, which re-casts EHR
coding as a few-shot learning task. First, we construct a heterogeneous EHR
word-entity (HEWE) graph for each EHR, where the words and entities extracted
from an EHR serve as nodes and the relations between them serve as edges. Then,
CoGraph learns similarities and dissimilarities between HEWE graphs from
different ICD codes so that information can be transferred among them. In a
few-shot learning scenario, the model only has access to frequent ICD codes
during training, which might force it to encode features that are useful for
frequent ICD codes only. To mitigate this risk, CoGraph devises two graph
contrastive learning schemes, GSCL and GECL, that exploit the HEWE graph
structures so as to encode transferable features. GSCL utilizes the
intra-correlation of different sub-graphs sampled from HEWE graphs while GECL
exploits the inter-correlation among HEWE graphs at different clinical stages.
Experiments on the MIMIC-III benchmark dataset show that CoGraph significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on EHR coding, not only on frequent ICD
codes, but also on rare codes, in terms of several evaluation indicators. On
frequent ICD codes, GSCL and GECL improve the classification accuracy and F1 by
1.31% and 0.61%, respectively, and on rare ICD codes CoGraph has more obvious
improvements by 2.12% and 2.95%.

maximize the service confidence level, defined as the probability that the
latency of a given service type is below some threshold. To quantify the
performance gap between different LTE networks, we introduce a novel
statistical distance metric, called weighted Kantorovich-Rubinstein (K-R)
distance. Two scenarios based on finite- and infinite-horizon optimization of
short-term and long-term confidence are investigated. For each scenario, a
simple threshold policy based on weighted K-R distance is proposed and proved
to maximize the latency confidence for smart vehicles. Extensive analysis and

electron-electron correlations on highly nonlinear optical phenomena has not

high order harmonic generation at 50 K, increasing up to several hundred times

well-reproduced by an empirical scaling law that depends only on the material

peculiar property of the popular completely random measures (CRMs) as prior
models in Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) inference for the unseen-features

distribution for the number of unseen features, which depends on the sampling
information only through the sample size. CRMs are thus not a flexible prior
model for the unseen-features problem and, while the Poisson posterior
distribution may be appealing for analytical tractability and ease of
interpretability, its independence from the sampling information makes the BNP
approach a questionable oversimplification, with posterior inferences being
completely determined by the estimation of unknown prior's parameters. In this
paper, we introduce the stable-Beta scaled process (SB-SP) prior, and we show
that it allows to enrich the posterior distribution of the number of unseen
features arising under CRM priors, while maintaining its analytical
tractability and interpretability. That is, the SB-SP prior leads to a negative
Binomial posterior distribution, which depends on the sampling information
through the sample size and the number of distinct features, with corresponding
estimates being simple, linear in the sampling information and computationally
efficient. We apply our BNP approach to synthetic data and to real cancer
genomic data, showing that: i) it outperforms the most popular parametric and
nonparametric competitors in terms of estimation accuracy; ii) it provides
improved coverage for the estimation with respect to a BNP approach under CRM
priors.

devices with limited cross-client communication. Personalized federated
learning (PFL) further extends this setup to handle data heterogeneity between
clients by learning personalized models. A key challenge in this setting is to
learn effectively across clients even though each client has unique data that
is often limited in size. Here we present pFedGP, a solution to PFL that is
based on Gaussian processes (GPs) with deep kernel learning. GPs are highly
expressive models that work well in the low data regime due to their Bayesian
nature. However, applying GPs to PFL raises multiple challenges. Mainly, GPs
performance depends heavily on access to a good kernel function, and learning a
kernel requires a large training set. Therefore, we propose learning a shared
kernel function across all clients, parameterized by a neural network, with a
personal GP classifier for each client. We further extend pFedGP to include
inducing points using two novel methods, the first helps to improve
generalization in the low data regime and the second reduces the computational
cost. We derive a PAC-Bayes generalization bound on novel clients and
empirically show that it gives non-vacuous guarantees. Extensive experiments on
standard PFL benchmarks with CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CINIC-10, and on a new
setup of learning under input noise show that pFedGP achieves well-calibrated
predictions while significantly outperforming baseline methods, reaching up to
21% in accuracy gain.

thus important in many fields. The complexity using classical methods increases
linearly with the size of equations. The HHL algorithm proposed by Harrow et
al. achieves exponential acceleration compared with the best classical
algorithm. However, it has a relatively high demand for qubit resources and the
solution $\left| x \right\rangle $ is in a normalized form. Assuming that the
eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix of the linear systems of equations can be
represented perfectly by finite binary number strings, three hybrid iterative
phase estimation algorithms (HIPEA) are designed based on the iterative phase
estimation algorithm in this paper. The complexity is transferred to the
measurement operation in an iterative way, and thus the demand of qubit
resources is reduced in our hybrid algorithms. Moreover, the solution is stored
in a classical register instead of a quantum register, so the exact
unnormalized solution can be obtained. The required qubit resources in the
three HIPEA algorithms are different. HIPEA-1 only needs one single ancillary
qubit. The number of ancillary qubits in HIPEA-2 is equal to the number of
nondegenerate eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix of linear systems of
equations. HIPEA-3 is designed with a flexible number of ancillary qubits. The
HIPEA algorithms proposed in this paper broadens the application range of
quantum computation in solving linear systems of equations by avoiding the
problem that quantum programs may not be used to solve linear systems of
equations due to the lack of qubit resources.

(instruction) error rates, and typically support a minimal instruction set
having one type of two-qubit gate (2Q). To reduce program instruction counts
and improve application expressivity, vendors have proposed, and shown
proof-of-concept demonstrations of richer instruction sets such as XY gates
(Rigetti) and fSim gates (Google). These instruction sets comprise of families
of 2Q gate types parameterized by continuous qubit rotation angles. However,
having such a large number of gate types is problematic because each gate type
has to be calibrated periodically, across the full system, to obtain high
fidelity implementations. This results in substantial recurring calibration
overheads even on current systems which use only a few gate types. Our work
aims to navigate this tradeoff between application expressivity and calibration
overhead, and identify what instructions vendors should implement to get the
best expressivity with acceptable calibration time. We develop NuOp, a flexible
compilation pass based on numerical optimization, to efficiently decompose
application operations into arbitrary hardware gate types. Using NuOp and four
important quantum applications, we study the instruction set proposals of
Rigetti and Google, with realistic noise simulations and a calibration model.
Our experiments show that implementing 4-8 types of 2Q gates is sufficient to
attain nearly the same expressivity as a full continuous gate family, while
reducing the calibration overhead by two orders of magnitude. With several
vendors proposing rich gate families as means to higher fidelity, our work has
potential to provide valuable instruction set design guidance for near-term QC
systems.

hundred km. To achieve the best possible measurements, cross-calibration of the
plasma instruments is needed. We construct with two different physical models
to cross-calibrate the electron density as measured by the Mutual Impedance
Probe (MIP) to the ion current and spacecraft potential as measured by the
Rosetta Langmuir Probe (LAP), the latter validated with the Ion Composition
Analyser (ICA). We retrieve a continuous plasma density dataset for the entire
cometary mission with a much improved dynamical range compared to any plasma
instrument alone and, at times, improve the temporal resolution from
0.24-0.74~Hz to 57.8~Hz. The new density dataset is consistent with the
existing MIP density dataset and covers long time periods where densities were
too low to be measured by MIP. The physical model also yields, at 3~hour time
resolution, ion flow speeds as well as a proxy for the solar EUV flux from the
photoemission from the Langmuir Probes. We report on two independent
mission-wide estimates of the ion flow speed which are consistent with the bulk
H$_2$O$^+$ ion velocities as measured by ICA. We find the ion flow to
consistently be much faster than the neutral gas over the entire mission,
lending further evidence that the ions are collisionally decoupled from the
neutrals in the coma. RPC measurements of ion speeds are therefore not
consistent with the assumptions made in previously published plasma density
models of the comet ionosphere at the start and end of the mission. Also, the
measured EUV flux is perfectly consistent with independently derived values
previously published from Johansson et al. (2017) and lends support for the
conclusions drawn therein.

(rotation, reflection, and shifting) such that these point clouds are well
aligned? This problem, known as the generalized orthogonal Procrustes problem
(GOPP), plays a fundamental role in several scientific disciplines including
statistics, imaging science and computer vision. Despite its tremendous
practical importance, it is still a challenging computational problem due to
the inherent nonconvexity. In this paper, we study the semidefinite programming
(SDP) relaxation of the generalized orthogonal Procrustes problems and prove
that the tightness of the SDP relaxation holds, i.e., the SDP estimator exactly
equals the least squares estimator, if the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is
relatively large. We also prove that an efficient generalized power method with
a proper initialization enjoys global linear convergence to the least squares
estimator. In addition, we analyze the Burer-Monteiro factorization and show
the corresponding optimization landscape is free of spurious local optima if
the SNR is large. This explains why first-order Riemannian gradient methods
with random initializations usually produce a satisfactory solution despite the
nonconvexity. One highlight of our work is that the theoretical guarantees are
purely algebraic and do not require any assumptions on the statistical property
of the noise. Our results partially resolve one open problem posed in
[Bandeira, Khoo, Singer, 2014] on the tightness of the SDP relaxation in

coverage assumption) is critical with policy gradient methods. This is due to
the fact that, while the objective function is insensitive to updates in
unlikely states, the agent may still need improvements in those states in order
to reach a nearly optimal payoff. For this reason, wide coverage is used in
some form when analyzing theoretical properties of practical policy gradient
methods. However, this assumption can be unfeasible in certain environments,
for instance when learning is online, or when restarts are possible only from a
fixed initial state. In these cases, classical policy gradient algorithms can
have very poor convergence properties and sample efficiency. In this paper, we
develop Curious Explorer, a novel and simple iterative state space exploration
strategy that can be used with any starting distribution $\rho$. Curious
Explorer starts from $\rho$, then using intrinsic rewards assigned to the set
of poorly visited states produces a sequence of policies, each one more
exploratory than the previous one in an informed way, and finally outputs a
restart model $\mu$ based on the state visitation distribution of the
exploratory policies. Curious Explorer is provable, in the sense that we
provide theoretical upper bounds on how often an optimal policy visits poorly
visited states. These bounds can be used to prove PAC convergence and sample
efficiency results when a PAC optimizer is plugged in Curious Explorer. This
allows to achieve global convergence and sample efficiency results without any
coverage assumption for REINFORCE, and potentially for any other policy
gradient method ensuring PAC convergence with wide coverage. Finally, we plug
(the output of) Curious Explorer into REINFORCE and TRPO, and show empirically
that it can improve performance in MDPs with challenging exploration.

the parameters of complex scientific simulation models. While primarily run on
CPUs in HPC clusters, these algorithms have been shown to scale in performance
when developed to be run on massively parallel architectures such as GPUs.
While parallelizing existing SBI algorithms provides us with performance gains,
this might not be the most efficient way to utilize the achieved parallelism.
This work proposes a new algorithm, that builds on an existing SBI method -
Approximate Bayesian Computation with Sequential Monte Carlo(ABC-SMC). This new
algorithm is designed to utilize the parallelism not only for performance gain,
but also toward qualitative benefits in the learnt parameters. The key idea is
to replace the notion of a single 'step-size' hyperparameter, which governs how
the state space of parameters is explored during learning, with step-sizes
sampled from a tuned Beta distribution. This allows this new ABC-SMC algorithm
to more efficiently explore the state-space of the parameters being learnt. We
test the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to learn parameters for an
epidemiology model running on a Tesla T4 GPU. Compared to the parallelized
state-of-the-art SBI algorithm, we get similar quality results in $\sim 100$x
fewer simulations and observe ~80x lower run-to-run variance across 10

intramolecular rISC is slow (260 {\mu}s), but in aggregated films, BF2
generates intermolecular CT (inter-CT) states on picosecond timescales. In
contrast to the microsecond intramolecular rISC that is promoted by spin-orbit
interactions in most isolated DF molecules, photoluminescence-detected magnetic
resonance shows that these inter-CT states undergo rISC mediated by hyperfine
interactions on a ~24 ns timescale and have an average electron-hole separation

efficient DF and LED operation. Thus, access to these inter-CT states resolves

proportion give interval estimates that do not actually meet the definition of
a confidence interval, in that their coverages are sometimes lower than the
nominal confidence level. The methods are favoured because their intervals have
a shorter average length than the Clopper-Pearson (gold-standard) method, whose
intervals really are confidence intervals. Comparison of such methods is tricky
-- the best method should perhaps be the one that gives the shortest intervals
(on average), but when is the coverage of a method so poor that it should not
be classed as a means of forming confidence intervals?
  As the definition of a confidence interval is not being adhered to, another
criterion for forming interval estimates for a binomial proportion is needed.
In this paper we suggest a new criterion; methods which meet the criterion are
said to yield $\textit{locally correct confidence intervals}$. We propose a
method that yields such intervals and prove that its intervals have a shorter
average length than those of any other method that meets the criterion.
Compared with the Clopper-Pearson method, the proposed method gives intervals
with an appreciably smaller average length. The mid-$p$ method also satisfies
the new criterion and has its own optimality property.

four-vertex subgraph which is not a clique in deterministic amortized update

also study the query times for subgraphs containing an arbitrary edge that is
supplied only with the query as well as the case where only subgraphs
containing a vertex $s$ that is fixed beforehand are considered. For length-3
paths, paws, $4$-cycles, and diamonds our bounds match or are not far from
(conditional) lower bounds: Based on the OMv conjecture we show that any
dynamic algorithm that detects the existence of paws, diamonds, or $4$-cycles
or that counts length-$3$ paths takes update time $\Omega(m^{1/2-\delta})$.
  Additionally, for $4$-cliques and all connected induced subgraphs, we show a
lower bound of $\Omega(m^{1-\delta})$ for any small constant $\delta > 0$ for
the amortized update time, assuming the static combinatorial $4$-clique

of boundary measurement map to Tanner graph like code construction while
deriving new analytical bounds on its parameters. The derived bounds shows that
the complexity scales up on the size of the plucker coordinates. Finally,

fault-tolerant quantum computation. Theories of magic states attempt to
quantify this computational element via monotones and determine how these

statistical mechanical framework based on majorization to describe Wigner
negative magic states for qudits of odd prime dimension processed under
Clifford circuits. We show that majorization allows us to both quantify
disorder in the Wigner representation and derive upper bounds for magic
distillation. These bounds are shown to be tighter than other bounds, such as
from mana and thauma, and can be used to incorporate hardware physics, such as
temperature dependence and system Hamiltonians. We also show that a subset of
single-shot R\'{e}nyi entropies remain well-defined on quasi-distributions, are
fully meaningful in terms of data processing and can acquire negative values
that signal magic. We find that the mana of a magic state is the measure of
divergence of these R\'{e}nyi entropies as one approaches the Shannon entropy
for Wigner distributions, and discuss how distillation lower bounds could be
obtained in this setting. This use of majorization for quasi-distributions
could find application in other studies of non-classicality, and raises novel

this phenomenon by means of a suitable ""damping"" effect in the probability of a

challenge. While recent works demonstrated limited success on domain-specific
languages (DSL), it remains highly challenging to apply them to real-world
programming languages, such as C. Due to complicated syntax and token
variation, there are three major challenges: (1) unlike many DSLs, programs in
languages like C need to compile first and are not executed via interpreters;
(2) the program search space grows exponentially when the syntax and semantics
of the programming language become more complex; and (3) collecting a
large-scale dataset of real-world programs is non-trivial. As a first step to
address these challenges, we propose LaSynth and show its efficacy in a
restricted-C domain. More specifically, LaSynth learns the latent
representation to approximate the execution of partially generated programs,
even if they are incomplete in syntax (addressing (1)). The learned execution
significantly improves the performance of next token prediction over existing
approaches, facilitating search (addressing (2)). Finally, once trained with
randomly generated ground-truth programs and their IO pairs, LaSynth can
synthesize more concise programs that resemble human-written code. Furthermore,
retraining our model with these synthesized programs yields better performance
with fewer samples for both Karel and C program synthesis, indicating the
promise of leveraging the learned program synthesizer to improve the dataset
quality for input-output program synthesis (addressing (3)). When evaluating on
whether the program execution outputs match the IO pairs, LaSynth achieves
55.2% accuracy on generating simple C code with tens of tokens including loops
and branches, outperforming existing approaches without executors by around
20%.

scenarios of pathological thrombus formation. Most of these models involve
inherent uncertainties that must be assessed to increase the confidence in
model predictions and identify avenues of improvement for both thrombosis
modeling and anti-platelet therapies. In this work, an uncertainty
quantification analysis of a multi-constituent thrombosis model is performed
considering a common assay for platelet function (PFA-100). The analysis is
performed using a polynomial chaos expansion as a parametric surrogate for the
thrombosis model. The polynomial approximation is validated and used to perform
a global sensitivity analysis via computation of Sobol' coefficients. Six out
of fifteen parameters were found to be influential in the simulation
variability considering only individual effects. Nonetheless, parameter
interactions are highlighted when considering the total Sobol' indices. In
addition to the sensitivity analysis, the surrogate model was used to compute
the PFA-100 closure times of 300,000 virtual cases that align well with
clinical data. The current methodology could be used including common
anti-platelet therapies to identify scenarios that preserve the hematological
balance.

saturation of the fusion probability at bombarding energies above the

variable-length sequences on hardware accelerators, it is common practice to
introduce padding tokens, so that all sequences in a batch have the same
length. We show in this paper that the variation in sequence lengths in common

common, but not extreme, cases (e.g. GLUE-cola with sequence length 128), the
ratio is up to 89%. Existing methods to address the resulting inefficiency are
complicated by the need to avoid cross-contamination in self-attention, by a
reduction in accuracy when sequence ordering information is lost, or by
customized kernel implementations only valid for specific accelerators. This

techniques. It uses Fourier basis patterns as structured patterns for spatial
information acquisition in the Fourier domain. However, the spatial resolution
of the image reconstructed by FSI mainly depends on the number of Fourier
coefficients sampled. The reconstruction of a high-resolution image typically
requires a number of Fourier coefficients to be sampled, and therefore takes a
long data acquisition time. Here we propose a new sampling strategy for FSI. It
allows FSI to reconstruct a clear and sharp image with a reduced number of
measurements. The core of the proposed sampling strategy is to perform a
variable density sampling in the Fourier space and, more importantly, the
density with respect to the importance of Fourier coefficients is subject to a
one-dimensional Gaussian function. Combined with compressive sensing, the
proposed sampling strategy enables better reconstruction quality than
conventional sampling strategies, especially when the sampling ratio is low. We
experimentally demonstrate compressive FSI combined with the proposed sampling
strategy is able to reconstruct a sharp and clear image of 256-by-256 pixels
with a sampling ratio of 10%. The proposed method enables fast single-pixel
imaging and provides a new approach for efficient spatial information

GWs vary the pressure of the fluid by crossing it. This variation can be found
by analysing the gauge of the local observer. It is shown that one can, in

pressure of the fluid, which represents detected signals, are indeed much
higher than the correspondent values of GWs amplitudes. The examples of
rotating neutron stars (NSs) and relic GWs are discussed. Remarkably, a
confrontation of the proposed new method with a previous paper of Singh et al.
on a similar approach shows a possible improvement of the sensitivity
