dynamic mode decompositions in the application of Koopman analysis. Principle
among these limitations are the convergence of associated Dynamic Mode
Decomposition algorithms and the existence of Koopman modes. To address these
limitations, two major modifications are made, where Koopman operators are
removed from the analysis in light of Liouville operators (known as Koopman
generators in special cases), and these operators are shown to be compact for
certain pairs of Hilbert spaces selected separately as the domain and range of
the operator. While eigenfunctions are discarded in the general analysis, a
viable reconstruction algorithm is still demonstrated, and the sacrifice of
eigenfunctions realizes the theoretical goals of DMD analysis that have yet to
be achieved in other contexts. However, in the case where the domain is
embedded in the range, an eigenfunction approach is still achievable, where a
more typical DMD routine is established, but that leverages a finite rank
representation that converges in norm. The manuscript concludes with the
description of two Dynamic Mode Decomposition algorithms that converges when a
dense collection of occupation kernels, arising from the data, are leveraged in
the analysis.

had to choose between using methods with unrealistic assumptions about the
unknown distribution (e.g., Gaussianity) and methods like Hoeffding's
inequality that use weaker assumptions but produce much looser (wider)
intervals. In 1969, Anderson (1969) proposed a mean confidence interval
strictly better than or equal to Hoeffding's whose only assumption is that the
distribution's support is contained in an interval $[a,b]$. For the first time
since then, we present a new family of bounds that compares favorably to
Anderson's. We prove that each bound in the family has {\em guaranteed
coverage}, i.e., it holds with probability at least $1-\alpha$ for all
distributions on an interval $[a,b]$. Furthermore, one of the bounds is tighter
than or equal to Anderson's for all samples. In simulations, we show that for
many distributions, the gain over Anderson's bound is substantial.

  Model Adaptation","Accepted by ACL 2021 (long paper)",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Adapter-based tuning has recently arisen as an alternative to fine-tuning. It
works by adding light-weight adapter modules to a pretrained language model
(PrLM) and only updating the parameters of adapter modules when learning on a
downstream task. As such, it adds only a few trainable parameters per new task,
allowing a high degree of parameter sharing. Prior studies have shown that
adapter-based tuning often achieves comparable results to fine-tuning. However,
existing work only focuses on the parameter-efficient aspect of adapter-based
tuning while lacking further investigation on its effectiveness. In this paper,
we study the latter. We first show that adapter-based tuning better mitigates
forgetting issues than fine-tuning since it yields representations with less
deviation from those generated by the initial PrLM. We then empirically compare
the two tuning methods on several downstream NLP tasks and settings. We
demonstrate that 1) adapter-based tuning outperforms fine-tuning on
low-resource and cross-lingual tasks; 2) it is more robust to overfitting and
less sensitive to changes in learning rates.

Based only upon the few known lowest order Taylor coefficients, it is difficult
to discern the range of $\mu_B$ where such an expansion around $\mu_B=0$ can be
trusted. We introduce a resummation scheme for the Taylor expansion of the QCD
equation of state in $\mu_B$ that is based on the $n$-point correlation
functions of the conserved current ($D_n$). The method resums the contributions
of the first $N$ correlation function $D_1,\dots,D_N$ to the Taylor expansion
of the QCD partition function to all orders in $\mu_B$. We show that the
resummed partition function is an approximation to the reweighted partition
function at $\mu_B\ne0$. We apply the proposed approach to high-statistics
lattice QCD calculations using 2+1 flavors of Highly Improved Staggered Quarks
with physical quark masses on $32^3\times8$ lattices and for temperatures
$T\approx145$-176 MeV. We demonstrate that, as opposed to the Taylor expansion,
the resummed version not only leads to improved convergence but also reflects
the zeros of the resummed partition function and severity of the sign problem,
leading to its eventual breakdown. We also provide a generalization of our
scheme to include resummation of powers of temperature and quark masses in

for from different astronomical sources with only upper limits of their column
density determined without any successful detection remain the best candidates
for astronomical observation with respect to their isomers. These molecules are
believed to be formed on the surface of the interstellar dust grains and as
such, they are susceptible to interstellar hydrogen bonding. In this study, a
two way approach using ab initio quantum chemical simulations is considered in
optimizing the searches for these molecules in interstellar medium. Firstly,
these molecules and their isomers are subjected to the effect of interstellar
hydrogen bonding. Secondly, the deuterated analogues of these heterocycles are
examined for their possible detectability. From the results, all the
heterocycles except furan are found to be strongly bonded to the surfaces of
the interstellar dust grains thereby reducing their abundances, thus
contributing to their unsuccessful detection. Successful detection of furan
remains highly feasible. With respect to their D-analogues, the computed
Boltzmann factor indicates that they are formed under the dense molecular cloud
conditions where major deuterium fractionation dominates implying very high D/H
ratio above the cosmic D/H ratio which suggests the detectability of these
deuterated species.

crucial information which are subject to various analyses. Examples range from
cybersecurity, intrusion detection over usage analyses to trouble shooting.
Before data analysis is possible, desired information needs to be extracted
first out of the semi-structured log messages. State-of-the-art event parsing
often assumes static log events. However, any modern system is updated
consistently and with updates also log file structures can change. We call
those changes ""mutation"" and study parsing performance for different mutation

however, does not cover actual continuous parsing. Thus, we propose a novel and
flexible parser, called FlexParser, which can extract desired values despite
gradual changes in the log messages. It implies basic text preprocessing
followed by a supervised Deep Learning method. We train a stateful LSTM on
parsing one event per data set. Statefulness enforces the model to learn log
message structures across several examples. Our model was tested on seven
different, publicly available log file data sets and various kinds of

it has been observed to enter a limit cycle. In this work, we investigate two

penalised PET reconstructions. The first is a stochastic variance reduced EM
algorithm, termed as SVREM, an extension of the classical EM to the stochastic
context, by combining classical OSEM with insights from variance reduction
techniques for gradient descent. The second views OSEM as a preconditioned
stochastic gradient ascent, and applies variance reduction techniques, i.e.,
SAGA and SVRG, to estimate the update direction. We present several numerical
experiments to illustrate the efficiency and accuracy of the approaches. The
numerical results show that these approaches significantly outperform existing
OSEM type methods for penalised PET reconstructions, and hold great potential.

elicitability of multi-task peer prediction problems. We consider a designer
who has certain knowledge about the underlying information structure and wants
to elicit certain information from a group of participants. Our goal is to
infer the possibility of having a desirable mechanism based on the primitives
of the problem.
  Our contribution is twofold. First, we provide a characterization of the
elicitable multi-task peer prediction problems, assuming that the designer only
uses scoring mechanisms. Scoring mechanisms are the mechanisms that reward
participants' reports for different tasks separately. The characterization uses
a geometric approach based on the power diagram characterization in the
single-task setting ([Lambert and Shoham, 2009, Frongillo and Witkowski,
2017]). For general mechanisms, we also give a necessary condition for a
multi-task problem to be elicitable.
  Second, we consider the case when the designer aims to elicit some properties
that are linear in the participant's posterior about the state of the world. We
first show that in some cases, the designer basically can only elicit the
posterior itself. We then look into the case when the designer aims to elicit
the participants' posteriors. We give a necessary condition for the posterior
to be elicitable. This condition implies that the mechanisms proposed by Kong

sense that their mechanisms can solve any problem instance that can possibly be
elicitable.

by the high computational/space complexity in Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA).
To this end, we propose the Hierarchical MHSA (H-MHSA), whose representation is
computed in a hierarchical manner. Specifically, we first divide the input
image into patches as commonly done, and each patch is viewed as a token. Then,
the proposed H-MHSA learns token relationships within local patches, serving as
local relationship modeling. Then, the small patches are merged into larger
ones, and H-MHSA models the global dependencies for the small number of the
merged tokens. At last, the local and global attentive features are aggregated
to obtain features with powerful representation capacity. Since we only
calculate attention for a limited number of tokens at each step, the
computational load is reduced dramatically. Hence, H-MHSA can efficiently model
global relationships among tokens without sacrificing fine-grained information.
With the H-MHSA module incorporated, we build a family of
Hierarchical-Attention-based Transformer Networks, namely HAT-Net. To
demonstrate the superiority of HAT-Net in scene understanding, we conduct
extensive experiments on fundamental vision tasks, including image
classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance

amount of natural language data, ALBERT can convert input sentences into
versatile high-dimensional vectors potentially capable of solving multiple NLP
tasks. In that sense, ALBERT can be regarded as a well-designed
high-dimensional dynamical system whose operator is the Transformer's encoder,
and essential structures of human language are thus expected to be encapsulated
in its dynamics. In this study, we investigated the embedded properties of
ALBERT to reveal how NLP tasks are effectively solved by exploiting its
dynamics. We thereby aimed to explore the nature of human language from the
dynamical expressions of the NLP model. Our short-term analysis clarified that
the pre-trained model stably yields trajectories with higher dimensionality,
which would enhance the expressive capacity required for NLP tasks. Also, our
long-term analysis revealed that ALBERT intrinsically shows transient chaos, a
typical nonlinear phenomenon showing chaotic dynamics only in its transient,
and the pre-trained ALBERT model tends to produce the chaotic trajectory for a
significantly longer time period compared to a randomly-initialized one. Our
results imply that local chaoticity would contribute to improving NLP
performance, uncovering a novel aspect in the role of chaotic dynamics in human
language behaviors.

are equivalent to infinite-depth weight-tied feedforward networks. While
implicit models show improved accuracy and significant reduction in memory
consumption, they can suffer from ill-posedness and convergence instability.
  This paper provides a new framework, which we call Non-Euclidean Monotone
Operator Network (NEMON), to design well-posed and robust implicit neural
networks based upon contraction theory for the non-Euclidean norm
$\ell_{\infty}$. Our framework includes (i) a novel condition for
well-posedness based on one-sided Lipschitz constants, (ii) an average
iteration for computing fixed-points, and (iii) explicit estimates on
input-output Lipschitz constants. Additionally, we design a training problem
with the well-posedness condition and the average iteration as constraints and,
to achieve robust models, with the input-output Lipschitz constant as a
regularizer. Our $\ell_{\infty}$ well-posedness condition leads to a larger
polytopic training search space than existing conditions and our average
iteration enjoys accelerated convergence. Finally, we evaluate our framework in
image classification through the MNIST and the CIFAR-10 datasets. Our numerical

understanding and improvement of organic solar cells and other devices. They
often rely on one-dimensional models, but in the case of bulk-heterojunction
(BHJ) designs, it is not straightforward that these models' parameters have a
consistent physical interpretation. Indeed, contrarily to two- or
three-dimensional models, the BHJ morphology is not explicitly described in
one-dimensional models and must be implicitly expressed through effective
parameters. In order to inform experimental decisions, a helpful parameter
estimation method must establish that one can correctly interpret the provided
parameters. However, only a few works have been undertaken to reach that
objective in the context of BHJ organic solar cells. In this work, a realistic
two-dimensional model of BHJ solar cells is used to investigate the behavior of
state-of-the-art parameter estimation procedures in situations that emulate
experimental conditions. We demonstrate that fitting solely current-voltage
characteristics by an effective medium one-dimensional model can yield
nonsensical results, which may lead to counter-productive decisions about
future design choices. In agreement with previously published literature, we
explicitly demonstrate that fitting several characterization results together
can drastically improve the robustness of the parameter estimation. Based on a
detailed analysis of parameter estimation results, a set of recommendations is

the limitations that cannot be circumvented.

cascades energy from large to small scales, leading to ocean turbulence and
mixing. Oceans typically have a non-uniform density stratification profile;
moreover, submarine topography leads to a spatially varying ocean depth ($h$).
Under these conditions and assuming mild-slope bathymetry, we employ
multiple-scale analysis to derive the wave amplitude equations for triadic- and
self-interactions. The waves are assumed to have a slowly (rapidly) varying
amplitude (phase) in space and time. For uniform stratifications, the
horizontal wavenumber ($k$) condition for waves ($1$,$2$,$3$), given by
${k}_{(1,a)}+{k}_{(2,b)}+{k}_{(3,c)}=0$, is unaffected as $h$ is varied, where
$(a,b,c)$ denote the modenumber. Moreover, the nonlinear coupling coefficients
(NLC) are proportional to $1/h^2$, implying that triadic waves grow faster
while travelling up a seamount. For non-uniform stratifications, triads that do
not satisfy the condition $a=b=c$ may not satisfy the horizontal wavenumber
condition as $h$ is varied, and unlike uniform stratification, the NLC may not
decrease (increase) monotonically with increasing (decreasing) $h$. NLC, and
hence wave growth rates for both triads and self-interactions, can also vary
rapidly with $h$. The most unstable daughter wave combination of a triad with a
mode-1 parent wave can also change for relatively small changes in $h$. We also
investigate higher-order self-interactions in the presence of a monochromatic,
small amplitude bathymetry; here the bathymetry behaves as a zero frequency
wave. We derive the amplitude evolution equations and show that higher-order
self-interactions might be a viable mechanism of energy cascade.

important in many applications and thermal properties since it often limits
device performance. In this work, we study the effects on thermal conductivity
arising from the nanoscale structure of free-standing nanocrystalline silicon
films and the increasing surface-to-volume ratio when fabricated into suspended
optomechanical nanobeams. We characterize thermal transport in structures with
different grain sizes and elucidate the relative impact of grain size and
geometrical dimensions on thermal conductivity. We use a micro-time-domain
thermoreflectance method to study the impact of the grain size distribution,
from 10 to 400 nm, on the thermal conductivity in free-standing nanocrystalline
silicon films considering surface phonon and grain boundary scattering. We find
a drastic reduction in the thermal conductivity, down to values of 10
W.m^{-1}.K^{-1} and below, which is just a fraction of the conductivity of
single crystalline silicon. Decreasing the grain size further decreases the
thermal conductivity. We also observe that this effect is smaller in OM
nanostructures than in membranes due to the competition of surface scattering
in decreasing thermal conductivity. Finally, we introduce a novel versatile
contactless characterization technique that can be adapted to any structure
supporting a thermally shifted optical resonance and use it to evaluate the
thermal conductivity. This method can be used with optical resonances
exhibiting different mode profiles and the data is shown to agrees
quantitatively with the thermoreflectance measurements. This work opens the way
to a more generalized thermal characterization of optomechanical cavities and
to create hot-spots with engineered shapes at desired position in the
structures as a means to study thermal transport in coupled photon-phonon
structures.

linearised perturbation equations for the modes are derived in presence of

vacuum spacetime. The background field equations in absence of matter are
solved by assuming the expansion scalar to be proportional to the shear scalar.
Using the method of separation of variables, the axial perturbation parameter $
h_0(t, r) $ is obtained from its wave equation. The other perturbation $ h_1(t,
r) $ is then determined from $ h_0(t, r) $. The anisotropy of the background
spacetime is responsible for the damping of the axial waves. The polar
perturbation equations are much more involved compared to their FLRW
counterparts, as well as to the axial perturbations in Kantowski-Sachs
background. In both the axial and polar cases, the radial and temporal
solutions separate out as products. The temporal part of the polar perturbation
solutions are plotted against time to obtain an order of magnitude estimate of
the frequency of the propagating GWs and lies in the range 1000-2000 Hz. Using
standard observational data for the GW strain we have placed constraints on the
parameters in the polar perturbation solutions. The perturbation equations in
presence of matter show that the axial waves can cause perturbations only in
the azimuthal velocity of the fluid without deforming the matter field. But the
polar waves must perturb the energy density, the pressure and also the
non-azimuthal components of the fluid velocity.

if the behavior policy is highly sub-optimal compared to the expert, we show
that as long as the data from the behavior policy provides sufficient coverage
on the expert state-action traces (and with no necessity for a global coverage
over the entire state-action space), MILO can provably combat the covariate
shift issue in IL. Complementing our theory results, we also demonstrate that a
practical implementation of our approach mitigates covariate shift on benchmark
MuJoCo continuous control tasks. We demonstrate that with behavior policies

successfully imitates with an extremely low number of expert state-action pairs

through long-range aggregation from distant nodes. In this paper, we show that
properly tuned classical GNNs and multi-layer perceptrons match or exceed the

In many applications of CDMs, certain hierarchical structures among the latent

structure. Specifically, a directed acyclic graph is used to specify
hierarchical constraints on the allowable configurations of the discrete latent
attributes. In this paper, we consider the important yet unaddressed problem of
testing the existence of latent hierarchical structures in CDMs. We first
introduce the concept of testability of hierarchical structures in CDMs and
present sufficient conditions. Then we study the asymptotic behaviors of the
likelihood ratio test (LRT) statistic, which is widely used for testing nested
models. Due to the irregularity of the problem, the asymptotic distribution of
LRT becomes nonstandard and tends to provide unsatisfactory finite sample
performance under practical conditions. We provide statistical insights on such
failures, and propose to use parametric bootstrap to perform the testing. We
also demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of parametric bootstrap for

with minor compiler extensions, is capable of replacing existing solutions
without a performance penalty. The result is a performant and portable GPU
runtime that can be compiled with LLVM/Clang to Nvidia and AMD GPUs without the
need for CUDA or HIP during its development and compilation.
  While we tried to be OpenMP compliant, we identified the need for compiler
extensions to achieve the CUDA performance with our OpenMP runtime. We hope
that future versions of OpenMP adopt our extensions to make device programming
in OpenMP also portable across compilers, not only across execution platforms.
  The library we ported to OpenMP is the OpenMP device runtime that provides
OpenMP functionality on the GPU. This work opens the door for shipping OpenMP
offloading with a Linux distribution's LLVM package as the package manager
would not need a vendor SDK to build the compiler and runtimes. Furthermore,
our OpenMP device runtime can support a new GPU target through the use of a few
compiler intrinsics rather than requiring a reimplementation of the entire
runtime.

of robotic systems described by nonlinear Differential Algebraic Equations
(DAEs). In particular, the package can handle systems with contacts that are
described by complementarity constraints and provides a general framework for
specifying obstacle avoidance constraints. The package performs direct
transcription of the DAEs into a set of nonlinear equations by performing
orthogonal collocation on finite elements. The resulting optimization problem
belongs to the class of Mathematical Programs with Complementarity Constraints
(MPCCs). MPCCs fail to satisfy commonly assumed constraint qualifications and
require special handling of the complementarity constraints in order for
NonLinear Program (NLP) solvers to solve them effectively. PYROBOCOP provides
automatic reformulation of the complementarity constraints that enables NLP
solvers to perform optimization of robotic systems. The package is interfaced
with ADOLC for obtaining sparse derivatives by automatic differentiation and
IPOPT for performing optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in terms of speed and flexibility. We provide several numerical
examples for several robotic systems with collision avoidance as well as
contact constraints represented using complementarity constraints. We provide
comparisons with other open source optimization packages like CasADi and Pyomo .

decision-maker must identify an $\epsilon$-optimal arm with probability at
least $1 - \delta$, while minimizing the number of arm pulls (samples). Most of
the work on this topic is in the sequential setting, where there is no
constraint on the time taken to identify such an arm; this allows the
decision-maker to pull one arm at a time. In this work, the decision-maker is
given a deadline of $T$ rounds, where, on each round, it can adaptively choose
which arms to pull and how many times to pull them; this distinguishes the
number of decisions made (i.e., time or number of rounds) from the number of
samples acquired (cost). Such situations occur in clinical trials, where one
may need to identify a promising treatment under a deadline while minimizing
the number of test subjects, or in simulation-based studies run on the cloud,
where we can elastically scale up or down the number of virtual machines to
conduct as many experiments as we wish, but need to pay for the resource-time
used. As the decision-maker can only make $T$ decisions, she may need to pull
some arms excessively relative to a sequential algorithm in order to perform
well on all possible problems. We formalize this added difficulty with two
hardness results that indicate that unlike sequential settings, the ability to
adapt to the problem difficulty is constrained by the finite deadline. We
propose Elastic Batch Racing (EBR), a novel algorithm for this setting and
bound its sample complexity, showing that EBR is optimal with respect to both
hardness results. We present simulations evaluating EBR in this setting, where
it outperforms baselines by several orders of magnitude.

Therefore, a more general application of any trained model is quite limited for
medical imaging for clinical practice. Using separately trained models for each
unique lesion category or a unique patient population will require sufficiently
large curated datasets, which is not practical to use in a real-world clinical
set-up. Few-shot learning approaches can not only minimize the need for an
enormous number of reliable ground truth labels that are labour-intensive and
expensive but can also be used to model on a dataset coming from a new

model agnostic meta-learning (iMAML) algorithm under few-shot settings for
medical image segmentation. Our approach can leverage the learned weights from
diverse but small training samples to perform analysis on unseen datasets with
high accuracy. We show that, unlike classical few-shot learning approaches, our

(sparse but critical subnetworks) for dense networks, that can be trained in
isolation from random initialization to match the latter's accuracies. However,
finding winning tickets requires burdensome computations in the
train-prune-retrain process, especially on large-scale datasets (e.g.,
ImageNet), restricting their practical benefits. This paper explores a new
perspective on finding lottery tickets more efficiently, by doing so only with
a specially selected subset of data, called Pruning-Aware Critical set (PrAC
set), rather than using the full training set. The concept of PrAC set was
inspired by the recent observation, that deep networks have samples that are
either hard to memorize during training, or easy to forget during pruning. A
PrAC set is thus hypothesized to capture those most challenging and informative
examples for the dense model. We observe that a high-quality winning ticket can
be found with training and pruning the dense network on the very compact PrAC
set, which can substantially save training iterations for the ticket finding
process. Extensive experiments validate our proposal across diverse datasets
and network architectures. Specifically, on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny
ImageNet, we locate effective PrAC sets at 35.32%~78.19% of their training set
sizes. On top of them, we can obtain the same competitive winning tickets for
the corresponding dense networks, yet saving up to 82.85%~92.77%,
63.54%~74.92%, and 76.14%~86.56% training iterations, respectively. Crucially,
we show that a PrAC set found is reusable across different network
architectures, which can amortize the extra cost of finding PrAC sets, yielding
a practical regime for efficient lottery ticket finding.

defining the loss. The present research work considers the unconstrained

continuous monotonic functions which is particularly well suited for modelling
different representations of a distribution. This property enables the
efficient decoupling of the effect of the function approximator class from that

for learning different representations of the random return distribution (PDF,

topological phase transition (TPT). Despite the great importance in
understanding the formation of TWSs and their unusual properties, direct
observation of such a TPT has been challenging. Here, using a recently
discovered magnetic TWS Co3Sn2S2, we were able to systematically study its TPT
with detailed temperature dependence of the electronic structures by
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The TPT with drastic band structures
evolution was clearly observed across the Curie temperature (TC = 177 K),

problem, we take a two-stage approach. Structural parameters for families of
synthetic networks are first estimated from a small set of measurements of a
real-world network and these synthetic networks are then used to pre-train the
predictive neural networks. Since our model first searches for the most
suitable synthetic graph parameters which can be used as an ""oracle"" to create
arbitrarily large training data sets, we call our approach ""Oracle Search
Pre-training"" (OSP). For example, many real-world networks exhibit a Power law
structure in their node degree distribution, so a Power law model can provide a
foundation for the desired oracle to generate synthetic pre-training networks,
if the appropriate Power law graph parameters can be estimated. Accordingly, we
conduct experiments on real-world Facebook, Email, and Train Bombing networks
and show that OSP outperforms models without pre-training, models pre-trained
with inaccurate parameters, and other distance prediction schemes such as
Low-rank Matrix Completion. In particular, we achieve a prediction error of
less than one hop with only 1% of sampled distances from the social network.
OSP can be easily extended to other domains such as random networks by choosing
an appropriate model to generate synthetic training data, and therefore
promises to impact many different network learning problems.

efficiency in MRI, but differs from conventional sequences in terms of elevated
sensitivity to main field inhomogeneity and nonstandard T2/T1-weighted tissue
contrast. To address these limitations, multiple bSSFP images of the same
anatomy are commonly acquired with a set of different RF phase-cycling
increments. Joint processing of phase-cycled acquisitions serves to mitigate
sensitivity to field inhomogeneity. Recently phase-cycled bSSFP acquisitions
were also leveraged to estimate relaxation parameters based on explicit signal
models. While effective, these model-based methods often involve a large number
of acquisitions (N~10-16), degrading scan efficiency. Here, we propose a new
constrained ellipse fitting method (CELF) for parameter estimation with
improved efficiency and accuracy in phase-cycled bSSFP MRI. CELF is based on
the elliptical signal model framework for complex bSSFP signals; and it
introduces geometrical constraints on ellipse properties to improve estimation
efficiency, and dictionary-based identification to improve estimation accuracy.
CELF generates maps of T1, T2, off-resonance and on-resonant bSSFP signal by
employing a separate B1 map to mitigate sensitivity to flip angle variations.
Our results indicate that CELF can produce accurate off-resonance and
banding-free bSSFP maps with as few as N=4 acquisitions, while estimation
accuracy for relaxation parameters is notably limited by biases from
microstructural sensitivity of bSSFP imaging.

sufficiently large portions of the bath have to be included in the computation

reduced-order approach, by deriving an open quantum model for the reduced

reduced-order framework. The dynamics, described by the Liouville von Neumann
equation, is projected to subspaces using a Petrov-Galerkin projection. In
order to recover the global electron density profile as a vehicle to compute
the Coulomb potential, we propose a domain decomposition approach, where the
computational domain also includes segments of the bath that are selected using
logarithmic grids. This approach leads to a multi-component self-energy that
enters the effective Hamiltonian. We demonstrate the accuracy of the reduced

verification techniques are typically applied after the controller is designed
to evaluate whether the required properties (e.g., safety) are satisfied.
However, due to the increasing system complexity and the fundamental hardness
of designing a controller with formal guarantees, such an open-loop process of
design-then-verify often results in many iterations and fails to provide the
necessary guarantees. In this paper, we propose a correct-by-construction
control learning framework that integrates the verification into the control
design process in a closed-loop manner, i.e., design-while-verify.
Specifically, we leverage the verification results (computed reachable set of
the system state) to construct feedback metrics for control learning, which
measure how likely the current design of control parameters can meet the
required reach-avoid property for safety and goal-reaching. We formulate an
optimization problem based on such metrics for tuning the controller
parameters, and develop an approximated gradient descent algorithm with a
difference method to solve the optimization problem and learn the controller.
The learned controller is formally guaranteed to meet the required reach-avoid
property. By treating verifiability as a first-class objective and effectively
leveraging the verification results during the control learning process, our
approach can significantly improve the chance of finding a control design with
formal property guarantees. This is demonstrated via a set of experiments on
both linear and non-linear systems that use model-based or neural network based

of chaotic pair dynamics described by the quantum Chirikov standard map. The
time evolution is reversible even if a presence of small errors breaks time
reversal of classical dynamics due to exponential growth of errors induced by
exponential chaos instability. However, the quantum evolution remains
reversible since a quantum dynamics instability exists only on a
logarithmically short Ehrenfest time scale. We show that due to EPR pair
entanglement a measurement of one particle at the moment of time reversal
breaks exact time reversal of another particle which demonstrates only an

diffusion prediction on social media. Given the initial content and a sequence
of forwarding users, DyDiff-VAE aims to estimate the propagation likelihood for
other potential users and predict the corresponding user rankings. Inferring
user interests from diffusion data lies the foundation of diffusion prediction,
because users often forward the information in which they are interested or the
information from those who share similar interests. Their interests also evolve
over time as the result of the dynamic social influence from neighbors and the
time-sensitive information gained inside/outside the social media. Existing
works fail to model users' intrinsic interests from the diffusion data and
assume user interests remain static along the time. DyDiff-VAE advances the
state of the art in two directions: (i) We propose a dynamic encoder to infer
the evolution of user interests from observed diffusion data. (ii) We propose a
dual attentive decoder to estimate the propagation likelihood by integrating
information from both the initial cascade content and the forwarding user
sequence. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets from Twitter and

A typical issue impacting the achieved transverse emittance in muon collider
schemes so far considered is the phase space dilution caused by coulomb
interaction of primary particles propagating into the target where muons are
generated. In this study we present a new scheme for muon beam generation
occurring in vacuum by interactions of electron and photon beams. Setting the
center of mass energy at about twice the threshold (i.e. around $350$ MeV) the
normalised emittance of the muon beam generated via muon pair production
reaction ($e^-+\gamma \rightarrow e^-+\mu^+/\mu^-$) is largely independent on
the emittance of the colliding electron beam and is set basically by the excess
of transverse momentum in the muon pair creation. In absence of any other
mechanism for emittance dilution, the resulting muon beam, with energy in the
range of few tens of GeV, is characterised by an ultra-low normalised
transverse rms emittance of a few nm rad, corresponding to a geometrical
emittance below $10$ pm rad. This opens the way to a new muon collider paradigm
based on muon sources conceived with primary colliding beams delivered by $100$
GeV-class energy recovery linacs interacting with hard-X ray free electron
lasers. The challenge is to achieve the requested luminosity of the muon
collider adopting a strategy of low muon fluxes/currents combined to ultra-low

Cahn-Hilliard-Stokes-Darcy system that models two-phase flows in coupled free
flow and porous media. To avoid a well-known difficulty associated with the
coupling between the Cahn-Hilliard equation and the fluid motion, we make use
of the operator-splitting in the numerical scheme, so that these two solvers
are decoupled, which in turn would greatly improve the computational
efficiency. The unique solvability and the energy stability have been proved
in~\cite{CHW2017}. In this work, we carry out a detailed convergence analysis
and error estimate for the fully discrete finite element scheme, so that the
optimal rate convergence order is established in the energy norm, i.e.,, in the
$\ell^\infty (0, T; H^1) \cap \ell^2 (0, T; H^2)$ norm for the phase variables,
as well as in the $\ell^\infty (0, T; H^1) \cap \ell^2 (0, T; H^2)$ norm for
the velocity variable. Such an energy norm error estimate leads to a
cancellation of a nonlinear error term associated with the convection part,
which turns out to be a key step to pass through the analysis. In addition, a
discrete $\ell^2 (0;T; H^3)$ bound of the numerical solution for the phase
variables plays an important role in the error estimate, which is accomplished
via a discrete version of Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality in the finite element
setting.

  From a practical point of view, our results show that the current vacancy

simulations of common noise paths in order to produce accurate solutions, which
results in prohibitive computational cost and limits the applications to a

single-loop algorithm, named signatured deep fictitious play, by which we can
work with the unfixed common noise setup to avoid the nested-loop structure and
reduce the computational complexity significantly. The proposed algorithm can
accurately capture the effect of common uncertainty changes on mean-field
equilibria without further training of neural networks, as previously needed in
the existing machine learning algorithms. The efficiency is supported by three
applications, including linear-quadratic MFGs, mean-field portfolio game, and
mean-field game of optimal consumption and investment. Overall, we provide a
new point of view from the rough path theory to solve MFGs with common noise
with significantly improved efficiency and an extensive range of applications.

find that the arm has a similar geometry and metallicity to the nearby outer
LMC disk, indicating that it is comprised of perturbed disk material. Whilst
the azimuthal velocity and velocity dispersions along the arm are consistent
with those in the outer LMC, the in-plane radial velocity and out-of-plane
vertical velocity are significantly perturbed from equilibrium disk kinematics.
We compare these observations to a new suite of dynamical models of the
Magellanic/MW system, which describe the LMC as a collection of tracer
particles within a rigid potential, and the SMC as a rigid Hernquist potential.
Our models indicate the tidal force of the MW during the LMC's infall is likely
responsible for the observed increasing out-of-plane velocity along the arm.
Our models also suggest close LMC/SMC interactions within the past Gyr,
particularly the SMC's pericentric passage ~150 Myr ago and a possible SMC
crossing of the LMC disk plane ~400 Myr ago, likely do not perturb stars that
today comprise the arm. Historical interactions with the SMC prior to ~1 Gyr
ago may be required to explain some of the observed kinematic properties of the
arm, in particular its strongly negative in-plane radial velocity.

microscopic techniques has greatly improved scientists' ability to observe
real-time single-cell activities. In this paper, we consider the filtering
problem associate with these advanced technologies, i.e., how to estimate
latent dynamic states of an intracellular multiscale stochastic reaction
network from time-course measurements of fluorescent reporters. A good solution
to this problem can further improve scientists' ability to extract information
about intracellular systems from time-course experiments.
  A straightforward approach to this filtering problem is to use a particle
filter where particles are generated by simulation of the full model and
weighted according to observations. However, the exact simulation of the full
dynamic model usually takes an impractical amount of computational time and
prevents this type of particle filters from being used for real-time
applications, such as transcription regulation networks. Inspired by the recent
development of hybrid approximations to multiscale chemical reaction networks,
we approach the filtering problem in an alternative way. We first prove that
accurate solutions to the filtering problem can be constructed by solving the
filtering problem for a reduced model that represents the dynamics as a hybrid
process. The model reduction is based on exploiting the time-scale separations
in the original network and, therefore, can greatly reduce the computational
effort required to simulate the dynamics. As a result, we are able to develop
efficient particle filters to solve the filtering problem for the original
model by applying particle filters to the reduced model. We illustrate the
accuracy and the computational efficiency of our approach using several
numerical examples.

  Descent for Stackelberg Games",,,,,"cs.GT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A growing body of work in game theory extends the traditional Stackelberg
game to settings with one leader and multiple followers who play a Nash
equilibrium. Standard approaches for computing equilibria in these games
reformulate the followers' best response as constraints in the leader's
optimization problem. These reformulation approaches can sometimes be
effective, but often get trapped in low-quality solutions when followers'
objectives are non-linear or non-quadratic. Moreover, these approaches assume a
unique equilibrium or a specific equilibrium concept, e.g., optimistic or
pessimistic, which is a limiting assumption in many situations. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a stochastic gradient descent--based approach,
where the leader's strategy is updated by differentiating through the
followers' best responses. We frame the leader's optimization as a learning
problem against followers' equilibrium, which allows us to decouple the
followers' equilibrium constraints from the leader's problem. This approach
also addresses cases with multiple equilibria and arbitrary equilibrium
selection procedures by back-propagating through a sampled Nash equilibrium. To
this end, this paper introduces a novel concept called equilibrium flow to
formally characterize the set of equilibrium selection processes where the
gradient with respect to a sampled equilibrium is an unbiased estimate of the
true gradient. We evaluate our approach experimentally against existing
baselines in three Stackelberg problems with multiple followers and find that
in each case, our approach is able to achieve higher utility for the leader.

predictive model, mapping from environment features to parameters of an
optimization problem, which maximizes decision quality when the optimization is
subsequently solved. Recent work on decision-focused learning shows that
embedding the optimization problem in the training pipeline can improve
decision quality and help generalize better to unseen tasks compared to relying
on an intermediate loss function for evaluating prediction quality. We study
the predict-then-optimize framework in the context of sequential decision
problems (formulated as MDPs) that are solved via reinforcement learning. In
particular, we are given environment features and a set of trajectories from
training MDPs, which we use to train a predictive model that generalizes to
unseen test MDPs without trajectories. Two significant computational challenges
arise in applying decision-focused learning to MDPs: (i) large state and action
spaces make it infeasible for existing techniques to differentiate through MDP
problems, and (ii) the high-dimensional policy space, as parameterized by a
neural network, makes differentiating through a policy expensive. We resolve
the first challenge by sampling provably unbiased derivatives to approximate
and differentiate through optimality conditions, and the second challenge by
using a low-rank approximation to the high-dimensional sample-based
derivatives. We implement both Bellman--based and policy gradient--based
decision-focused learning on three different MDP problems with missing

manifest in the mathematics. The optimum flight path is an arc of a Great
Circle, specifically that circle which is the result of rotating the equator to
intersect the origin and destination airports. In order that the velocity
vector remain parallel to the surface of the spherical earth, a centripetal
force is required to rotate the velocity without altering its magnitude. This
force must be radially inward and thus parallel to the local vertical. The
assertion that ``lift balances gravity"" is only an approximation. To follow the
curve of the earth, the vertical component of aerodynamic lift must be
\emph{slightly weaker} than gravity so that the plane can be in ``orbitfall"".
  That is, to follow the curvature of the earth, maintaining a constant
distance $R$ from the center of the earth while flying at a constant speed $V$
and generating a vertical lift per unit mass $L$, the plane and all inside it
must fall towards the center of the earth with an acceleration, the ``orbitfall
acceleration"", $g_{orbitfall} \equiv g-L=V^{2} / R$ where $g$ is the usual
gravitational acceleration constant. If the plane travels a fraction $\digamma$
of the earth's circumference , then it must execute $\digamma$ of an outside
loop. This requires that the pitch angle $\xi$ must rotate nose-down at a rate
of $d \xi / dt=V/R$.
  The dynamic stability of a non-military aircraft makes this pitch change
continuously without pilot intervention: the horizontal stabilizers act as
weathervanes, suppressing small perturbations so that the longitudinal axis
remains at a constant angle of attack. Neither pilot nor passenger is aware of
the orbitfall or the automatic pitch changes -- physics invisible but
essential.

performance of 5G networks. In this paper, we propose a two time-scale
framework for the reservation-based network slicing in the backhaul and Radio
Access Network (RAN). In the proposed two time-scale scheme, a subset of
network slices is activated via a novel sparse optimization framework in the
long time-scale with the goal of maximizing the expected utilities of tenants
while in the short time-scale the activated slices are reconfigured according
to the time-varying user traffic and channel states. Specifically, using the
statistics from users and channels and also considering the expected utility
from serving users of a slice and the reconfiguration cost, we formulate a
sparse optimization problem to update the configuration of a slice resources
such that the maximum isolation of reserved resources is enforced. The
formulated optimization problems for long and short time-scales are non-convex
and difficult to solve. We use the $\ell_q$-norm, $0<q<1$, and group LASSO
regularizations to iteratively find convex approximations of the optimization
problems. We propose a Frank-Wolfe algorithm to iteratively solve approximated
problems in long time-scales. To cope with the dynamical nature of traffic
variations, we propose a fast, distributed algorithm to solve the approximated
optimization problems in short time-scales. Simulation results demonstrate the
performance of our approaches relative to optimal solutions and the existing

tasks such as pose estimation, sensor fusion, and grasping. Iterative closest
point (ICP) is a commonly used pose estimation algorithm which provides a point
estimate of the transformation between two point clouds. There are many sources
of uncertainty in this process that may arise due to sensor noise, ambiguous
environment, and occlusion. However, for safety critical problems such as
autonomous driving, a point estimate of the pose transformation is not
sufficient as it does not provide information about the multiple solutions.
Current probabilistic ICP methods usually do not capture all sources of
uncertainty and may provide unreliable transformation estimates which can have
a detrimental effect in state estimation or decision making tasks that use this
information. In this work we propose a new algorithm to align two point clouds
that can precisely estimate the uncertainty of ICP's transformation parameters.
We develop a Stein variational inference framework with gradient based
optimization of ICP's cost function. The method provides a non-parametric
estimate of the transformation, can model complex multi-modal distributions,
and can be effectively parallelized on a GPU. Experiments using 3D kinect data
as well as sparse indoor/outdoor LiDAR data show that our method is capable of
efficiently producing accurate pose uncertainty estimates.

at the sample level and the TKML individual loss for multi-label/multi-class
classification at the label level. A combination loss of AoRR and TKML is
proposed as a new learning objective for improving the robustness of
multi-label learning in the face of outliers in sample and labels alike. Our
empirical results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed optimization
frameworks and demonstrate the applicability of proposed losses using synthetic
and real data sets.

using both reflection M-EELS and transmission EELS with $\leq$10 meV energy
resolution. We observed the well-known 1 eV plasmon in this material for
momentum $q\lesssim$ 0.12 r.l.u., but found that it does not persist to large
$q$. For $q\gtrsim0.12$ r.l.u., we observe a frequency-independent continuum,
similar to that observed in early Raman scattering experiments [3,4], that
correlates highly with the strange metal phase [2].
  In his Comment (arXiv:2103.10268), Joerg Fink claims we do not see the
plasmon, and that our results are inconsistent with optics, RIXS, and the
author's own transmission EELS measurements with $\sim$100 meV resolution from
the early 1990's [5,6]. The author claims we have made a trigonometry error and
are measuring a larger momentum than we think. The author asserts that the
two-particle excitations of cuprate strange metals are accurately described by
weakly interacting band theory in RPA with corrections for conduction band
carrier lifetimes and Umklapp effects.
  Here, we show that the author's Comment is in contradiction with known
information from the literature. At $q\lesssim0.12$ r.l.u. we see the same 1 eV
plasmon as other techniques. Moreover we compute our momentum correctly,
adjusting the sample and detector angles during an energy scan to keep $q$
fixed. The only discrepancy is between our data and the results of Ref. [5] for
$q\gtrsim0.12$ r.l.u. where, because of the coarse resolution used, the data
had to be corrected for interference from the elastic line. A reexamination of
these corrections in early transmission EELS measurements would likely shed
light on this discrepancy.

and the cross-rack communication dominates the system bandwidth. In We study
the rack-aware storage system where all storage nodes are organized in racks
and within each rack the nodes can communicate freely without taxing the system
bandwidth. Rack-aware regenerating codes (RRCs) were proposed for minimizing
the repair bandwidth for single erasures. In the initial setting of RRCs, the
repair of a single node requires the participation of all the remaining nodes
in the rack containing the failed node as well as a large number of helper
racks containing no failures. Consequently, the repair may be infeasible in
front of multiple node failures. In this work, a relaxed repair model that can
tolerate multiple node failures by simultaneously reducing the intra-rack
connections and cross-rack connections is proposed. A tradeoff between the
storage and repair bandwidth under the relaxed repair model is derived, and
parameters of the two extreme points on the tradeoff curve are characterized
for the minimum storage and minimum bandwidth respectively. Moreover, two codes
corresponding to the extreme points are explicitly constructed over the fields
of size comparable to the code length and with the lowest sub-packetization.
Finally, for the convenience of practical use, systematic encoding processes
for the two codes are also established.

to understand PS implementation in terms of requirements engineering (or

acceleration, with which a compact network (student) is trained by mimicking
the softmax output of a pre-trained high-capacity network (teacher). In
tradition, KD usually relies on access to the training samples and the
parameters of the white-box teacher to acquire the transferred knowledge.
However, these prerequisites are not always realistic due to storage costs or
privacy issues in real-world applications. Here we propose the concept of
decision-based black-box (DB3) knowledge distillation, with which the student
is trained by distilling the knowledge from a black-box teacher (parameters are
not accessible) that only returns classes rather than softmax outputs. We start
with the scenario when the training set is accessible. We represent a sample's
robustness against other classes by computing its distances to the teacher's
decision boundaries and use it to construct the soft label for each training
sample. After that, the student can be trained via standard KD. We then extend
this approach to a more challenging scenario in which even accessing the
training data is not feasible. We propose to generate pseudo samples
distinguished by the teacher's decision boundaries to the largest extent and
construct soft labels for them, which are used as the transfer set. We evaluate
our approaches on various benchmark networks and datasets and experiment

binary perovskite systems in ambient conditions over time. Different
combinations of the endmembers, MAPbI3, MAPbBr3, FAPbI3, FAPbBr3, CsPbI3, and

combinations. In total, roughly 1100 different compositions are synthesized.
Each library is fabricated twice using two different antisolvents: toluene and

performed every 5 minutes for approximately 6 hours. Non-negative Matrix
Factorization (NMF) is then utilized to map the time- and
compositional-dependent optoelectronic properties. Through the utilization of
this workflow for each library, we demonstrate that the selection of
antisolvent is critical to the stability of metal halide perovskites in ambient
conditions. We explore possible dynamical processes, such as halide
segregation, responsible for either the stability or eventual degradation as
caused by the choice of antisolvent. Overall, this high-throughput study
demonstrates the vital role that antisolvents play in the synthesis of

is a significant runtime sink. The system of fully implicit mass balance
equations is highly nonlinear and often difficult to solve for the nonlinear
solver, generally Newton(-Raphson). Strong nonlinearities can cause Newton
iterations to converge very slowly. This frequently results in time step cuts,
leading to computationally expensive simulations. Much literature has looked
into how to improve the nonlinear solver through enhancements or safeguarding
updates. In this work, we take a different approach; we aim to improve
convergence with a smoother finite volume discretization scheme which is more
suitable for the Newton solver.
  Building on recent work, we propose a novel total velocity hybrid upwinding
scheme with weighted average flow mobilities (WA-HU TV) that is unconditionally
monotone and extends to compositional multiphase simulations. Analyzing the
solution space of a one-cell problem, we demonstrate the improved properties of
the scheme and explain how it leverages the advantages of both phase potential
upwinding and arithmetic averaging. This results in a flow subproblem that is
smooth with respect to changes in the sign of phase fluxes, and is well-behaved
when phase velocities are large or when co-current viscous forces dominate.
Additionally, we propose a WA-HU scheme with a total mass (WA-HU TM)
formulation that includes phase densities in the weighted averaging.
  The proposed WA-HU TV consistently outperforms existing schemes, yielding
benefits from 5\% to over 50\% reduction in nonlinear iterations. The WA-HU TM
scheme also shows promising results; in some cases leading to even more
efficiency. However, WA-HU TM can occasionally also lead to convergence issues.
Overall, based on the current results, we recommend the adoption of the WA-HU
TV scheme as it is highly efficient and robust.

Upflows in EUV coronal spectral lines are routinely osberved at their
boundaries, and provide the most direct way for upflowing material to escape
into the heliosphere. The mechanisms that form and drive these upflows,
however, remain to be fully characterised. It is unclear how quickly they form,
or how long they exist during their lifetimes. They could be initiated low in
the atmosphere during magnetic flux emergence, or as a response to processes
occuring high in the corona when the active region is fully developed. On 2019,
March 31, a simple bipolar active region (AR 12737) emerged and upflows
developed on each side. We used observations from Hinode, SDO, IRIS, and Parker
Solar Probe (PSP) to investigate the formation and development of the upflows
from the eastern side. We used the spectroscopic data to detect the upflow, and
then used the imaging data to try to trace its signature back to earlier in the
active region emergence phase. We find that the upflow forms quickly, low down
in the atmosphere, and that its initiation appears associated with a small

compute high dimensional free energy landscapes. The original TASS method
employs the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM) which is an iterative
post-processing to reweight and stitch high dimensional probability
distributions in sliced windows that are obtained in the presence of
restraining biases. The WHAM necessitates that TASS windows lie close to each
other for proper overlap of distributions and span the collective variable
space of interest. On the other hand, increase in number of TASS windows
implies more number of simulations, and thus it affects the efficiency of the
method. To overcome this problem, we propose herein a new mean-force (MF) based
reweighting scheme called TASS-MF, which enables accurate computation with a
fewer number of windows devoid of the WHAM post-processing. Application of the
technique is demonstrated for alanine di- and tripeptides in vacuo to compute
their two- and four-dimensional free energy landscapes, the latter of which is
formidable in conventional umbrella sampling and metadynamics. The landscapes

ensuring the privacy of individual users in a single training round. We contend
that such designs can lead to significant privacy leakages over multiple
training rounds, due to partial user selection/participation at each round of

user selection strategies for federated learning lead to leaking users'

address this challenge, we introduce a secure aggregation framework with
multi-round privacy guarantees. In particular, we introduce a new metric to
quantify the privacy guarantees of federated learning over multiple training
rounds, and develop a structured user selection strategy that guarantees the
long-term privacy of each user (over any number of training rounds). Our
framework also carefully accounts for the fairness and the average number of

properties of each instance (i.e., human/non-human, rigid/deformable,
known/unknown category) by propagating its preview mask to other frames. In the
second pass, i.e., contextual segmentation, we introduce multiple contextual
segmentation schemes. For human instance, we develop skeleton-guided
segmentation in a frame along with object flow to correct and refine the result
across frames. For non-human instance, if the instance has a wide variation in
appearance and belongs to known categories (which can be inferred from the
initial mask), we adopt instance segmentation. If the non-human instance is
nearly rigid, we train FCNs on synthesized images from the first frame of a
video sequence. In the final pass, i.e., guided segmentation, we develop a
novel fined-grained segmentation method on non-rectangular regions of interest
(ROIs). The natural-shaped ROI is generated by applying guided attention from
the neighbor frames of the current one to reduce the ambiguity in the
segmentation of different overlapping instances. Forward mask propagation is
followed by backward mask propagation to further restore missing instance
fragments due to re-appeared instances, fast motion, occlusion, or heavy
deformation. Finally, instances in each frame are merged based on their depth
values, together with human and non-human object interaction and rare instance
priority. Experiments conducted on the DAVIS Test-Challenge dataset demonstrate

pre-training models, our model is coarse-grained instead of treating individual
words as input, therefore avoiding an overly fine-grained with excessive

pre-training phase to fully leverage multimodal information from unlabeled

3D directions can be identified with points on the sphere, DirectionNet
estimates discrete distributions on the sphere as its output. We evaluate our

atomic-cooling gas cloud. Using a set of three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) simulations, we investigate the star formation process in the magnetized

simulations show that the primordial magnetic seed field can be quickly
amplified during the early accretion phase after the first protostar formation.
The strong magnetic field efficiently extracts angular momentum from accreting
gas and increases the accretion rate, which results in the high fragmentation
rate in the gravitationally unstable disk region. On the other hand, the
coalescence rate of fragments is also enhanced by the angular momentum transfer
due to the magnetic effects. Almost all the fragments coalesce to the primary
star, so the mass growth rate of the massive star increases due to the magnetic
effects. We conclude that the magnetic effects support the direct collapse

exhibited that achieve theoretical lower bounds for excess risk in any
dimension for large data (Statistically Consistent Interpolation). These are
non-parametric Nadaraya-Watson estimators with singular kernels. The recently
proposed weighted interpolating nearest neighbors method (wiNN) is in this
class, as is the previously studied Hilbert kernel interpolation scheme, in
which the estimator has the form $\hat{f}(x)=\sum_i y_i w_i(x)$, where $w_i(x)=
\|x-x_i\|^{-d}/\sum_j \|x-x_j\|^{-d}$. This estimator is unique in being
completely parameter-free. While statistical consistency was previously proven,
convergence rates were not established. Here, we comprehensively study the
finite sample properties of Hilbert kernel regression. We prove that the excess
risk is asymptotically equivalent pointwise to $\sigma^2(x)/\ln(n)$ where
$\sigma^2(x)$ is the noise variance. We show that the excess risk of the plugin

invertible transformation. Therefore, we can compute the exact Bayes error of
the learned flow models by computing it for Gaussian base distributions, which
can be done efficiently using Holmes-Diaconis-Ross integration. Moreover, we
show that by varying the temperature of the learned flow models, we can
generate synthetic datasets that closely resemble standard benchmark datasets,
but with almost any desired Bayes error. We use our approach to conduct a
thorough investigation of state-of-the-art classification models, and find that
in some -- but not all -- cases, these models are capable of obtaining accuracy
very near optimal. Finally, we use our method to evaluate the intrinsic
""hardness"" of standard benchmark datasets, and classes within those datasets.

considered a nuisance, inasmuch as it prevents long-term predictions in

deterministic chaos and tailor ray trajectories in arbitrary two-dimensional
optical billiards, by introducing spatially varying refractive index therein. A
new refractive index landscape is obtained by a conformal mapping, which makes
the trajectories of the chaotic billiard fully predictable and the billiard
fully integrable. Moreover, trajectory rectification can be pushed a step
further by relating chaotic billiards with non-Euclidean geometries. Two
examples are illustrated by projecting billiards built on a sphere as well as
the deformed spacetime outside a Schwarzschild black hole, which respectively
lead to all periodic orbits and spiraling trajectories in the resulting 2D

degrades rapidly due to a combination of fast scattering and inter-valley
exchange interaction. This leads to a sub-picosecond valley coherence time,
making coherent manipulation of exciton a highly formidable task. Using
monolayer MoS$_2$ sandwiched between top and bottom graphene, here we
demonstrate perfect valley coherence by observing 100% degree of linear
polarization of excitons in steady state photoluminescence. This is achieved in
this unique design through a combined effect of (a) suppression in exchange
interaction due to enhanced dielectric screening, (b) reduction in exciton
lifetime due to a fast inter-layer transfer to graphene, and (c) operating in
the motional narrowing regime. We disentangle the role of the key parameters
affecting valley coherence by using a combination of calculation (solutions of
Bethe-Salpeter and steady-state Maialle-Silva-Sham equations) and choice of
systematic design of experiments using four different stacks with varying
screening and exciton lifetime. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
report in which the valley coherence timescale has been significantly enhanced

photometry, spectra and light curves are all analyzed, and their results are
combined in order to support our interpretation of the observations: the likely
presence of a magnetic field combined with gas features around the sdB. Based
on the triple-peaked H lines, the magnetic field strength is estimated and, by
using the shellspec code, qualitative models of gas configurations are fitted
to the observations. All observations can either be explained by a magnetic
field of ~650 kG which enables the formation of a centrifugal magnetosphere, or
a non-magnetic hot subdwarf surrounded by a circumstellar gas disk/torus. Both
scenarios are not mutually exclusive and both can be explained by a recent
merger. J22564-5910 is the first object of its kind. It is a rapidly spinning
sdB with gas still present in the system. It is the first post-merger star
observed this early after the merger event, and as such is very valuable system
to test merger theories. If the magnetic field can be confirmed, it is not only
the first magnetic sdB, but it hosts the strongest magnetic field ever found in
a pre-white dwarf object. Thus, it could represent the long-sought for

its effect on distracted driver behavior remains unclear. To this end, a

evaluations were performed on three types of haptic guidance: none (manual),
fixed authority, and adaptive authority based on feedback from the forearm
surface electromyography of the driver. Evaluation results indicated that, for
both attentive and distracted drivers, haptic guidance with adaptive authority
yielded lower driver workload and reduced lane departure risk than manual
driving and fixed authority. Moreover, there was a tendency for distracted
drivers to reduce grip strength on the steering wheel to follow the haptic
guidance with fixed authority, resulting in a relatively shorter double lane

  There are a variety of applications of our results. In this paper, we focus

high-temperature expansion of the ferromagnetic Ising model. We obtain an
$O(n\log{n})$ sampling algorithm for the ferromagnetic Ising model with a
nonzero external field on bounded-degree graphs, which improves upon the
classical result of Jerrum and Sinclair (1993) for this class of graphs. We
obtain further applications to antiferromagnetic two-spin models on line

enriched by vanadium. By comparison to W, we explain this by the reduced but

together promote defect recombination over clustering.

such a structure is fixed to be a vector space with data variations represented
by translations along individual latent dimensions. We argue this simple
structure is suboptimal since it requires the model to learn to discard the
properties (e.g. different scales of changes, different levels of abstractness)
of data variations, which is an extra work than equivariance learning. Instead,
we propose to encode the data variations with groups, a structure not only can
equivariantly represent variations, but can also be adaptively optimized to
preserve the properties of data variations. Considering it is hard to conduct
training on group structures, we focus on Lie groups and adopt a

factors higher than 5 for long binary sequences (sequences with lengths greater
than 200). Some useful mathematical properties related to the flip operation of
the skew-symmetric binary sequences are presented in this work. By exploiting
those properties, the memory complexity of state-of-the-art stochastic merit
factor optimization algorithms could be reduced from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$. As a
proof of concept, a lightweight stochastic algorithm was constructed, which can
optimize pseudo-randomly generated skew-symmetric binary sequences with long
lengths (up to ${10}^5+1$) to skew-symmetric binary sequences with a merit
factor greater than 5. An approximation of the required time is also provided.
The numerical experiments suggest that the algorithm is universal and could be
applied to skew-symmetric binary sequences with arbitrary lengths.

Previous works usually achieve it by learning to progressively refine the
contour prediction or adopting a shape representation with limited
expressiveness. In this work, we argue that the difficulty in regressing the
contour points in one pass is mainly due to the ambiguity when discretizing a
smooth contour into a polygon. To address the ambiguity, we propose a novel
differentiable rendering-based approach named \textbf{ContourRender}. During
training, it first predicts a contour generated by an invertible shape
signature, and then optimizes the contour with the more stable silhouette by
converting it to a contour mesh and rendering the mesh to a 2D map.
  This method significantly improves the quality of contour without iterations
or cascaded refinements. Moreover, as optimization is not needed during
inference, the inference speed will not be influenced.
  Experiments show the proposed ContourRender outperforms all the contour-based
instance segmentation approaches on COCO, while stays competitive with the
iteration-based state-of-the-art on Cityscapes. In addition, we specifically
select a subset from COCO val2017 named COCO ContourHard-val to further
demonstrate the contour quality improvements. Codes, models, and dataset split

interactive networks (DINs) to address the above limitations. User interactions
guide the model to recognize complicated tumors and quickly adapt to
heterogeneous tumors. We introduce a simple but effective Exponential Distance

the spatial and appearance prior. Comparing with popular Euclidean and geodesic
distances, ExpDT is more robust to various image sizes, which reserves the
distribution of interactive inputs. Furthermore, to enhance the tumor-related
features, we design a deep interactive module to propagate the guides into
deeper layers. We train and evaluate DINs on three MRI data sets from NF1
patients. The experiment results yield significant improvements of 44% and 14%
in DSC comparing with automated and other interactive methods, respectively. We
also experimentally demonstrate the efficiency of DINs in reducing user burden

VQAs makes it difficult to establish analytic theories. Analytic estimations of
the impact of the noise are urgent for searching for quantum advantages, as
numerical simulations of noisy quantum computers on classical computers are
heavy and quite limited to small scale problems. In this paper, we establish
analytic estimations of the error in the cost function of VQAs due to the
noise. The estimations are applicable to any typical VQAs under the Gaussian
noise, which is equivalent to a class of stochastic noise models. Notably, the
depolarizing noise is included in this model. As a result, we obtain
estimations of the noise level to guarantee a required precision. Our formulae
show how the Hessian of the cost function, the spectrum of the target operator,
and the geometry of the ansatz affect the sensitivity to the noise. This
insight implies trade-off relations between the trainability and the noise
resilience of the cost function. We also obtain rough estimations which can be
easily calculated without detailed information of the cost function. As a
highlight of the applications of the formula, we propose a quantum error
mitigation method which is different from the extrapolation and the

aleatoric from the epistemic uncertainty. Secondly, the current methodology
considers the uncertainty averaged over all test samples, implicitly averaging
out overconfident and underconfident predictions. When checking if the correct
fraction of test points falls inside prediction intervals, a good score on
average gives no guarantee that the intervals are sensible for individual

about MHD laminar flow in annular channel with transverse magnetic field in
this paper. In terms of the method, a computationally cheap semi-analytic
algorithm is developed based on spectral method and perturbation expansion. By
virtue of the fast computation, dense cases with almost continuous varying
Hartmann number $M$, Reynolds number $Re$ and cross-section ratio $\eta$ are
calculated to explore the flow patterns that are missed in previous research.
In terms of the results of inertialess regime, we establish the average
velocity map and electric-flow coupling delimitation in $\eta$-$M$ space. Seven
phenomenological flow patterns and their analytical approaches are identified.
In terms of the results of inertial regime, we examine the law of decreasing
order-of-magnitude of inertial perturbation on primary flow with increasing
Hartmann number. The proposed semi-analytic solution coincides with the
$Re^2/M^{4}$ suppression theory of Baylis & Hunt (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 43,
1971, pp. 423-428) in the case of $M<40$. When $M>40$, the pair of trapezoid
vortices of secondary flow begins to crack and there is therefore a faster drop
in inertial perturbation as $Re^2/M^{5}$, which is a new suppression theory.
When $M>80$, the anomalous reverse vortices are fully developed near Shercliff
layers resulting in the slower suppression mode of $Re^2/M^{2.5}$, which
confirms the prediction of Tabeling & Chabrerie (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 103,
1981, pp. 225-239).

clusters are evolved from the same giant molecular cloud. Then their stars'
chemical compositions must be the same. But recent photometric and
spectroscopic studies of globular clusters reveal the presence of more-than-one
stellar populations inside globular clusters. This finding challenges our
classical view of globular clusters.
  In this work, we investigated the possibility of solving multiple stellar
populations problem in globular clusters using dark matter assumptions. We
showed that the presence of dark matter inside globular clusters changes the
physical parameters (e.g. chemical composition, luminosity, temperature, age,
etc.) of stars inside them. We supposed that dark matter distributed
non-uniformly inside globular clusters. It means stars in high dark matter
density environments (like the central region of globular clusters) are more
affected by the presence of dark matter. Using this assumption, we showed that
stars in different locations of globular clusters (corresponding to different
dark matter densities) follow different evolutionary paths (e.g. on
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram). We used this note to infer that the presence of
dark matter inside globular clusters can be the reason for the multiple stellar
populations.

successfully controlled within a reasonable range and insensitive to the number

the extremely metal-poor regime ($\mathrm{[Fe/H]}<-3$) to nearly solar
metallicity. In the Galactic anticentre direction, the rotational velocity
($V_{\phi}$) is similar to the tangential velocity in the galactic longitude
direction ($V_{\ell}$). This allows us to estimate $V_{\phi}$ from Gaia early
data-release 3 (Gaia EDR3) proper motions for stars without radial velocity
measurements. This substantially increases the sample of stars in the outer
disc with estimated rotational velocities. Our stellar sample towards the
anticentre is dominated by a kinematical thin disc with a mean rotation of
$\sim -220$ km $\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. However, our analysis reveals the presence of
more stellar substructures. The most intriguing is a well populated extension
of the kinematical thin disc down to $\mathrm{[Fe/H]} \sim -2$. A scarser fast
rotating population reaching the extremely metal-poor regime, down to
$\mathrm{[Fe/H]} \sim -3.5$ is also detected, but without statistical
significance to unambiguously state whether this is the extremely metal-poor
extension of the thin disc or the high rotating tail of hotter structures (like
the thick disc or the halo). In addition, a more slowly rotating kinematical
thick disc component is also required to explain the observed $V_{\ell}$
distribution at $\mathrm{[Fe/H]} > -1.5$. Furthermore, we detect signatures of
a ""heated disc"", the so-called Splash, at metallicities higher than $\sim-1.5$.
Finally, at $\mathrm{[Fe/H]} < -1.5$ our anticentre sample is dominated by a

is often achieved by solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) or its
variants. TSP requires to define costs between the individual targets, which -
in a map with obstacles - requires to compute mutual paths between the targets.
These paths, found by path planning, are used both to define the costs (e.g.,
based on their length or time-to-traverse) and also they define paths that are
later used in the final solution. To enable TSP finding a good-quality
solution, it is necessary to find these target-to-target paths as short as
possible. We propose a sampling-based planner called Space-Filling Forest
(SFF*) that solves the part of finding collision-free paths. SFF* uses multiple
trees (forest) constructed gradually and simultaneously from the targets and
attempts to find connections with other trees to form the paths. Unlike
Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), which uses the nearest-neighbor rule for
selecting nodes for expansion, SFF* maintains an explicit list of nodes for
expansion. Individual trees are grown in a RRT* manner, i.e., with rewiring the
nodes to minimize their cost. Computational results show that SFF* provides
shorter target-to-target paths than existing approaches, and consequently, the
final TSP solutions also have a lower cost.

collect a real-world Live Stream E-Commerce (LSEC) dataset. Different from
conventional E-commerce activities, the streamers play a pivotal role in the
LSEC events. Hence, the key is to make full use of rich interaction information
among streamers, users, and products. We first conduct data analysis on the
tripartite interaction data and quantify the streamer's influence on users'
purchase behavior. Based on the analysis results, we model the tripartite
information as a heterogeneous graph, which can be decomposed to multiple
bipartite graphs in order to better capture the influence. We propose a novel
Live Stream E-Commerce Graph Neural Network framework (LSEC-GNN) to learn the
node representations of each bipartite graph, and further design a multi-task
learning approach to improve product recommendation. Extensive experiments on
two real-world datasets with different scales show that our method can
significantly outperform various baseline approaches.

time-varying nature of the asset-return covariance allows us to introduce the

has become more and more popular due to high-cost of pixel-level annotation on

to single-source-single-target pair, and can not be directly extended to
multiple target domains. In this work, we propose a collaborative learning
framework to achieve unsupervised multi-target domain adaptation. An
unsupervised domain adaptation expert model is first trained for each
source-target pair and is further encouraged to collaborate with each other
through a bridge built between different target domains. These expert models
are further improved by adding the regularization of making the consistent
pixel-wise prediction for each sample with the same structured context. To
obtain a single model that works across multiple target domains, we propose to
simultaneously learn a student model which is trained to not only imitate the
output of each expert on the corresponding target domain, but also to pull
different expert close to each other with regularization on their weights.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively
exploit rich structured information contained in both labeled source domain and
multiple unlabeled target domains. Not only does it perform well across
multiple target domains but also performs favorably against state-of-the-art

augmentation provided by the pretrained ASR module for smoothing label

that each augmentation method individually improves the accuracy on top of the
conventional SpecAugment; further improvements are obtained by combining these

the Hatano-Nelson model and the Su-Schreieffer-Heeger model, which can be
exactly solved with the single impurity being treated as an effective boundary

diversify samples with various patch styles in the feature-level, which can
benefit the training of both stages. First, CPSS can significantly improve the

pseudo-labels for the latter stage. Second, CPSS can reduce the influence of
noisy pseudo-labels and also avoid the model overfitting to the target domain

$\Phi_\Omega\leq 1-e^{-|\Omega|}$, with equality if and only if $\Omega$ is a

should make the signal very dim. In this latter condition, which is the focus
of this review, a possible explanation is that TeV photons convert to ALPs in
the presence of strong and/or extended magnetic fields, such as those in the
core of galaxy clusters or around compact objects, or even those in the
intergalactic space. This mixing affects the observed ${\gamma}$-ray spectrum
of distant sources, either by signal recovery or the production of
irregularities in the spectrum, called ""wiggles"", according to the specific
microscopic realization of the ALP and the ambient magnetic field at the

explores the use of the Fit to Median Error measure in machine learning
regression automation, using evolutionary computation in order to improve the

measures it improves interpretability by regularising learnt input-output

regularisers to illustrate that the use of the Fit to Median Error produces
regression neural networks which model more consistent input-output

external field approximation, the gauge choice for this time-dependent
relativistic non-perturbative Coulomb field cannot be overcome by previous
method, and leads to considerable gauge-dependence of the transient spontaneous
radiation spectrum. We calculate explicitly with a simple one-dimensional
charged harmonic oscillator that such a gauge-dependence can be of a measurable
magnitude of 10 MHz or larger for the commonly used Coulomb, Lorentz, and
multipolar gauges. Contrary to the popular view, we explain that this gauge
dependence is not really a disaster, but actually an advantage here: The
relativistic bound-state problem is so complicated that a fully quantum-field
method is still lacking, thus the external field approximation cannot be
derived and hence not guaranteed. However, by fitting to the experimental data,
one may always define an effective external field, which may likely be
parameterized with the gauge potential in a particular gauge. This effective
external field would not only be of phenomenological use, but also shed light
on the physical significance of the gauge field.

plasma-molecule interactions involving $D_2^+$ and possibly $D^-$ play an
important role as sinks of energy (through hydrogenic radiation as well as
dissociation) and particles during divertor detachment if low target
temperatures ($< 3$ eV) are achieved. Both molecular activated recombination
(MAR) and ion source reduction due to a power limitation effect are shown to be
important in reducing the ion target flux during a density ramp. In contrast,
the electron-ion recombination (EIR) ion sink is too small to play an important
role in reducing the ion target flux. MAR or EIR do not occur during $N_2$

  The impact of $D_2^+$ is shown to be underestimated in present (vibrationally

composite medium, we show peculiar properties such as extraordinary waves that
propagate at frequencies below the cut-off frequency of the corresponding
stationary medium. We explain how these unique solutions give rise to an
extreme Fresnel drag that exists already with weak and slow spatiotemporal
modulation. Next, we turn to derive the effective material permittivity that
corresponds to each of the first few supported modes, and write the average
fields and Poynting's vector. Nonlocality, nonreciprocity, and anisotropy due
to the spatiotemporal modulation direction, are three inherent properties of
this medium, and are clearly seen in the effective material parameters. As a
figure of merit, we also derive the effective permittivity of a plasma medium
with spatiotemporally modulated plasma frequency. This comparison is
interesting since the plasma medium can be considered as the effective medium
that is obtained by a stationary wire medium. We validate that homogenization
and spatiotemporal variation are not necessarily interchangeable operations.
And indeed, in certain parameter regimes the homogenization should be performed
directly on spatiotemporally modulated composite medium, rather than first
homogenize the stationary medium and then phenomenologically introduce the
effect of the space-time modulation.

We jointly predict cuboid allocation as part segmentation and cuboid shapes and

cloud into a set of parametric cuboids using a variational auto-encoder

preserve the existed localized bound states or destroy some of them but cannot

threshold or near-threshold enhancement. Prior to our study, there is no
straightforward way of distinguishing even the lowest channel
threshold-enhancement of the nucleon-nucleon system using only the
cross-sections. The difficulty lies in the proximity of either a bound or
virtual state pole to the threshold which creates an almost identical structure
in the scattering region. Identifying the nature of the pole causing the
enhancement falls under the general classification problem and supervised
machine learning using a feed-forward neural network is known to excel in this
task. In this study, we discuss the basic idea behind deep neural network and
how it can be used to identify the nature of the pole causing the enhancement.
The applicability of the trained network can be explored by using an exact
separable potential model to generate a validation dataset. We find that within
some acceptable range of the cut-off parameter, the neural network gives high
accuracy of inference. The result also reveals the important role played by the
background singularities in the training dataset. Finally, we apply the method
to nucleon-nucleon scattering data and show that the network was able to give
the correct nature of pole, i.e. virtual pole for ${}^1S_0$ partial

clusters of defects largely dominate below the solid-hexatic critical line. The
latter percolate in the liquid phase very close to the hexatic-liquid
transition, both for continuous and discontinuous transitions, in the
homogeneous liquid regime. At critical percolation the clusters of defects are
fractal with statistical and geometric properties that, within our numerical
accuracy, are independent of the activity and compatible with the universality
class of uncorrelated critical percolation. We also characterize the spatial
organization of different kinds of point-like defects and we show that the
disclinations are not free, but rather always very near more complex defect
structures. At high activity, the bulk of the dense phase generated by
Motility-Induced Phase Separation is characterized by a density of point-like
defects, and statistics and morphology of defect clusters, set by the amount of
activity and not the packing fraction. Hexatic domains within the dense phase
are separated by grain-boundaries along which a finite network of topological
defects resides, interrupted by gas bubbles in cavitation. The fractal
dimension of this network diminishes for increasing activity. This structure is
dynamic in the sense that the defect network allows for an unzipping mechanism
that leaves free space for gas bubbles to appear, close, and even be released
into the dilute phase.

propose a novel knowledge-aware deep framework that incorporates some clinical

tasks, i.e., skin lesion segmentation and melanoma recognition. Specifically,
to exploit the knowledge of morphological expressions of the lesion region and
also the periphery region for melanoma identification, a lesion-based pooling
and shape extraction (LPSE) scheme is designed, which transfers the structure
information obtained from skin lesion segmentation into melanoma recognition.
Meanwhile, to pass the skin lesion diagnosis knowledge from melanoma
recognition to skin lesion segmentation, an effective diagnosis guided feature
fusion (DGFF) strategy is designed. Moreover, we propose a recursive mutual
learning mechanism that further promotes the inter-task cooperation, and thus
iteratively improves the joint learning capability of the model for both skin
lesion segmentation and melanoma recognition. Experimental results on two
publicly available skin lesion datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed
method for melanoma analysis.

the underlying function has a singularity, it has been observed by L. N.
Trefethen in 2011 that its Chebyshev interpolants exhibit an error localization
property, that is, their errors in a neighborhood of the singularity are
obviously larger than elsewhere. In this paper, we first present a pointwise
error analysis for Chebyshev projections of functions with a singularity and
prove that the rate of convergence of Chebyshev projections of degree $n$ at
each point away from the singularity is one power of $n$ faster than that of at
the singularity. This gives a rigorous justification for the error localization
of Chebyshev projections. We then extend the framework of our analysis to
Chebyshev interpolants, Chebyshev spectral differentiations and Legendre
projections and justify their error localization using similar arguments. As a
result, we find that Chebyshev spectral differentiations converge faster than
their best counterparts except in a neighborhood of the singularity and, in the
particular case where the singularity is located in the interior of interval,
they converge even faster than their best counterparts in the maximum norm.

Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have grown recently due to advances in UAV avionics
technology and application domains. In many applications, the multirotor UAV is
required to accurately perform aggressive maneuvers in challenging scenarios
like the presence of external wind disturbances or in-flight payload changes.
In this paper, we propose a systematic controller tuning approach based on
identification results obtained by a recently developed Deep Neural Networks
with the Modified Relay Feedback Test (DNN-MRFT) algorithm. We formulate a
linear equivalent representation suitable for DNN-MRFT using feedback
linearization. This representation enables the analytical investigation of
different controller structures and tuning settings, and captures the
non-linearity trends of the system. With this approach, the trade-off between
performance and robustness in design was made possible which is convenient for
the design of controllers of UAVs operating in uncertain environments. We
demonstrate that our approach is adaptive and robust through a set of
experiments, where accurate trajectory tracking is maintained despite
significant changes to the UAV aerodynamic characteristics and the application
of wind disturbance. Due to the model-based system design, it was possible to
obtain low discrepancy between simulation and experimental results which is
beneficial for potential use of the proposed approach for real-time model-based
planning and fault detection tasks. We obtained RMSE of $3.59 \; cm$ when
tracking aggressive trajectories in the presence of strong wind, which is on
par with state-of-the-art.

First, an unsupervised Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with channel-attention

a convolutional neural network (CNN) with attention framework is presented for

We extend these techniques to address the following questions: which regions of
the solar atmosphere are most connected during a solar flare, and what are the
most likely responses across several spectral windows based on the observation
of a single Mg II spectrum? Our models are derived from several million IRIS
spectra collected from 21 M- and X-class flares. We applied this framework to
archetypal Mg II flare spectra, and analyzed the results from a multi-line
perspective. We find that (1) the line correlations from the photosphere to the
transition region are highest in flare ribbons. (2) Blue-shifted reversals
appear simultaneously in Mg II, C II, and Si IV during the impulsive phase,
with Si IV displaying possible optical depth effects. Fe II shows signs of
strong emission, indicating deep early heating. (3) The Mg II line appears to
typically evolve a blue-shifted reversal that later returns to line center and
becomes single peaked within 1-3 minutes. The widths of these single peaked
profiles slowly erode with time. During the later flare stages, strong red wing
enhancements indicating coronal rain are evident in Mg II, C II, and Si IV. Our
framework is easily adaptable to any multi-line data set, and enables
comprehensive statistical analyses of the atmospheric behavior in different

  Shear-Strained Porous Glasses",,,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper we study the mechanical properties and pore structure in a
three-dimensional molecular dynamics model of porous glass under athermal
quasistatic shear. The vitreous samples are prepared by rapid thermal quench
from a high temperature molten state. The pore structures form via solid-gas
phase separation. The quiescent samples exhibit a wide range of pore
topography, from inter-connected pore network to randomly distributed compact
pores depending on the material density. We find the shear modulus strongly
depends on the density and porosity. Under mechanical loading, the pore
structure rearranges which is reflected in the pore size distribution function.
Our results show that with increase in strain the distribution widens as the
adjacent pores coalesce and form larger pores. We also propose a universal
scaling law for the pore size distribution function which offers excellent data
collapse for highly porous materials in the undeformed case. From the data
scaling we identify a critical density which can be attributed to the
transition point from a porous-type to bulk-type material. The validity of the
scaling law under finite deformation is also analyzed.

construct robust quantum control for quantum information processing due to

construct geometric gates using nonadiabatic quantum evolutions to reduce
errors due to decoherence. However, it has been shown that nonadiabatic
geometric gates are not necessarily more robust than dynamical ones, in
contrast to an intuitive expectation. Here we experimentally investigate this
issue for the case of nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation~(NHQC) and
show that conventional NHQC schemes cannot guarantee the expected robustness
due to a cross coupling to the states outside the computational space. We
implement a different set of constraints for gate construction in order to
suppress such cross coupling to achieve an enhanced robustness. Using a
superconducting quantum circuit, we demonstrate high-fidelity holonomic gates
whose infidelity against quasi-static transverse errors can be suppressed up to
the fourth order, instead of the second order in conventional NHQC and
dynamical gates. In addition, we explicitly measure the accumulated dynamical
phase due to the above mentioned cross coupling and verify that it is indeed
much reduced in our NHQC scheme. We further demonstrate a protocol for
constructing two-qubit NHQC gates also with an enhanced robustness.

firstly an improved optimization method based on the gradient descent and the
univariate search technique is proposed to simulate the powder layout, and then
the laser beam propagation between the powder and the surface of the substrate
is tracked and recorded to obtain the energy distribution. Finally, according
to the distribution of laser energy between the powder layer and the surface of
the substrate, the heat source model is divided into two parts: one is the
surface of substrate heat source model being the Gaussian distribution, the
other one is the powder layer heat source model-satisfying the Gaussian
distribution on the horizontal plane, changes in the depth direction according
to the functional relationship obtained by the fitting. In addition, the
thickness change of the powder layer after fusion is analyzed, and is taken
into account in the heat source model. The powder simulation results are
compared with the powder scattering experiment results to verify the
effectiveness of the powder model. Comparing the temperature field simulation
with the experiment, the results show that the predicted molten pool width
relative error is 6.4%, and the connect width error is 9.6%, which has better
accuracy and verifies the validity of the temperature field simulation model.

this purpose, we introduce as a hierarchical prior, a general exponential
distribution, refered to as conditionally exponential prior (CEP). The
first-degree CEP corresponds to focality enforcing Laplace prior that suffers
from strong depth bias making the deep activity unrecoverable. We sample over
multiple resolution levels via RAMUS to reduce this bias as it is known to
depend on the resolution of the source space. Moreover, we introduce a
procedure based on the physiological a priori knowledge of the brain activity
to obtain the shape and scale parameters of the gamma hyperprior that steer the
CEP. The posterior estimates are calculated using iterative statistical
methods, expectation maximization and iterative alternating sequential
algorithm, which we show to be algorithmically similar and to have a close
resemblance to the iterative reweighting methods. The performance of CEP is
compared with the recent sampling-based dipole localization method Sequential
semi-analytic Monte Carlo estimation (SESAME) in numerical experiments of
simulated somatosensory evoked potentials related to the human median nerve

of that and due to the limited amount of mispronounced L2 speech, the model is
more likely to overfit. To limit this risk, we train it in a multi-task setup.
In the first task, we estimate the probabilities of word-level
mispronunciation. For the second task, we use a phoneme recognizer trained on
phonetically transcribed L1 speech that is easily accessible and can be
automatically annotated. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, we improve
the accuracy of detecting word-level pronunciation errors in AUC metric by 30%

disturbances simultaneously, a model predictive control (MPC) method based on

this end, the SME method is employed to estimate the states with the existence
of unknown-but-bounded process and measurement disturbances. The networked MPC

achieves an efficient compression of video into low-dimensional latent
variables by decomposing each frame according to its hierarchical structure.
That is, we consider that video can be separated into background and foreground

implement task-driven semantic coding with the traditional hybrid coding

to improve the performance of existing models by scaling them up, while
simultaneously trying to reduce power consumption and computational footprint.
Unfortunately, most existing methods for inducing performant sparse models
still entail the instantiation of dense parameters, or dense gradients in the
backward-pass, during training. For very large models this requirement can be
prohibitive. In this work we propose Top-KAST, a method that preserves constant
sparsity throughout training (in both the forward and backward-passes). We
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by showing that it performs comparably
to or better than previous works when training models on the established
ImageNet benchmark, whilst fully maintaining sparsity. In addition to our
ImageNet results, we also demonstrate our approach in the domain of language
modeling where the current best performing architectures tend to have tens of
billions of parameters and scaling up does not yet seem to have saturated
performance. Sparse versions of these architectures can be run with
significantly fewer resources, making them more widely accessible and
applicable. Furthermore, in addition to being effective, our approach is
straightforward and can easily be implemented in a wide range of existing
machine learning frameworks with only a few additional lines of code. We
therefore hope that our contribution will help enable the broader community to
explore the potential held by massive models, without incurring massive
computational cost.

We observe that a widely-used ECE dataset exhibits a bias that the majority of

clauses or are the emotion clauses themselves. Existing models for ECE tend to
explore such relative position information and suffer from the dataset bias. To
investigate the degree of reliance of existing ECE models on clause relative

which the relative position information is no longer the indicative feature of
cause clauses. We test the performance of existing models on such adversarial
examples and observe a significant performance drop. To address the dataset
bias, we propose a novel graph-based method to explicitly model the emotion
triggering paths by leveraging the commonsense knowledge to enhance the
semantic dependencies between a candidate clause and an emotion clause.
Experimental results show that our proposed approach performs on par with the
existing state-of-the-art methods on the original ECE dataset, and is more
robust against adversarial attacks compared to existing models.

electromagnetic field acts as the twist potential to raise the gravitational
Faraday rotation as well as the gravitational Stern-Gerlach effect in the said

vanishes. In other words, the massless charged particle(s) immersed in a
uniform magnetic field are able to twist the spacetime in principle, and
responsible for the rotation of the plane of polarization of light. This, in
fact, could have applications in the basic physics and the analog models of
gravity. Here, we also study the effect of magnetic fields in the Kerr and

investigated problems in the theory of complex systems of the last years.
Understanding this relationship is of relevance to a range of disciplines --
from Neuroscience to Geomorphology. A major strategy of investigating this
relationship is the quantitative comparison of a representation of network
architecture (structural connectivity) with a (network) representation of the
dynamics (functional connectivity). Analysing such SC/FC relationships has over
the past years contributed substantially to our understanding of the functional
role of network properties, such as modularity, hierarchical organization, hubs
and cycles.
  Here, we show that one can distinguish two classes of functional connectivity
-- one based on simultaneous activity (co-activity) of nodes the other based on
sequential activity of nodes. We delineate these two classes in different
categories of dynamical processes -- excitations, regular and chaotic
oscillators -- and provide examples for SC/FC correlations of both classes in
each of these models. We expand the theoretical view of the SC/FC
relationships, with conceptual instances of the SC and the two classes of FC
for various application scenarios in Geomorphology, Freshwater Ecology, Systems
Biology, Neuroscience and Social-Ecological Systems.
  Seeing the organization of a dynamical processes in a network either as

optimization algorithms capable of using them. Recently, Safaryan et al. (2021)
pioneered a dramatically different compression design approach: they first use
the local training data to form local smoothness matrices and then propose to
design a compressor capable of exploiting the smoothness information contained
therein. While this novel approach leads to substantial savings in
communication, it is limited to sparsification as it crucially depends on the
linearity of the compression operator. In this work, we generalize their
smoothness-aware compression strategy to arbitrary unbiased compression
operators, which also include sparsification. Specializing our results to
stochastic quantization, we guarantee significant savings in communication
complexity compared to standard quantization. In particular, we prove that
block quantization with $n$ blocks theoretically outperforms single block
quantization, leading to a reduction in communication complexity by an
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ factor, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the distributed
system. Finally, we provide extensive numerical evidence with convex
optimization problems that our smoothness-aware quantization strategies
outperform existing quantization schemes as well as the aforementioned
smoothness-aware sparsification strategies with respect to three evaluation
metrics: the number of iterations, the total amount of bits communicated, and
wall-clock time.

excessive maintenance costs. To this end, we propose a framework for converting
state-of-the-art segmentation CNNs to Multi-Exit Semantic Segmentation (MESS)
networks: specially trained models that employ parametrised early exits along
their depth to i) dynamically save computation during inference on easier
samples and ii) save training and maintenance cost by offering a post-training
customisable speed-accuracy trade-off. Designing and training such networks
naively can hurt performance. Thus, we propose a novel two-staged training
scheme for multi-exit networks. Furthermore, the parametrisation of MESS
enables co-optimising the number, placement and architecture of the attached
segmentation heads along with the exit policy, upon deployment via exhaustive
search in <1 GPUh. This allows MESS to rapidly adapt to the device capabilities

  The corresponding result at the level of Poincar\'e sections is that, for a

intervals and irreducible combinatorics, any generalized interval exchange
transformation which is topologically conjugate to a IET from this set and
satisfies an obstruction given by a boundary operator is

be an unrealistic assumption. We define a class of locally stationary processes
which can lead to more accurate uncertainty quantification over making an
invalid assumption of stationarity. This class of processes assumes the model
parameters to be time-varying and parameterizes them in terms of a
transformation of basis functions that ensures that the processes are locally
stationary. We develop methods and theory for parameter estimation in this
class of models, and propose a test that allow us to examine certain departures
from stationarity. We assess our methods using simulation studies and apply
these techniques to the analysis of an electroencephalogram time series.

operators for ill-posed inverse problems. The proposed method combines the
classical variational framework with iterative unrolling, which essentially
seeks to minimize a weighted combination of the expected distortion in the
measurement space and the Wasserstein-1 distance between the distributions of
the reconstruction and ground-truth. More specifically, the regularizer in the
variational setting is parametrized by a deep neural network and learned
simultaneously with the unrolled reconstruction operator. The variational
problem is then initialized with the reconstruction of the unrolled operator
and solved iteratively till convergence. Notably, it takes significantly fewer
iterations to converge, thanks to the excellent initialization obtained via the
unrolled operator. The resulting approach combines the computational efficiency
of end-to-end unrolled reconstruction with the well-posedness and
noise-stability guarantees of the variational setting. Moreover, we demonstrate
with the example of X-ray computed tomography (CT) that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, and that it outperforms or

datapoints, for example N = 30, how tight can PAC-Bayes and test set bounds be
made? For such small datasets, test set bounds adversely affect generalisation
performance by withholding data from the training procedure. In this setting,
PAC-Bayes bounds are especially attractive, due to their ability to use all the
data to simultaneously learn a posterior and bound its generalisation risk. We
focus on the case of i.i.d. data with a bounded loss and consider the generic
PAC-Bayes theorem of Germain et al. While their theorem is known to recover
many existing PAC-Bayes bounds, it is unclear what the tightest bound derivable
from their framework is. For a fixed learning algorithm and dataset, we show
that the tightest possible bound coincides with a bound considered by Catoni;
and, in the more natural case of distributions over datasets, we establish a
lower bound on the best bound achievable in expectation. Interestingly, this
lower bound recovers the Chernoff test set bound if the posterior is equal to
the prior. Moreover, to illustrate how tight these bounds can be, we study
synthetic one-dimensional classification tasks in which it is feasible to
meta-learn both the prior and the form of the bound to numerically optimise for
the tightest bounds possible. We find that in this simple, controlled scenario,
PAC-Bayes bounds are competitive with comparable, commonly used Chernoff test
set bounds. However, the sharpest test set bounds still lead to better
guarantees on the generalisation error than the PAC-Bayes bounds we consider.

is considered a constant. The previously best known approximation algorithm for
this problem is the local improvement algorithm SquareImp proposed by Berman.
It achieves a performance ratio of $\frac{d}{2}+\epsilon$ in time
$\mathcal{O}(|V(G)|^{d+1}\cdot(|V(G)|+|E(G)|)\cdot (d-1)^2\cdot
\left(\frac{d}{2\epsilon}+1\right)^2)$ for any $\epsilon>0$, which has remained

an additional factor of $\mathcal{O}(|V(G)|^{(d-1)^2})$ in the running time. In
particular, our result implies a polynomial time $\frac{d}{2}$-approximation
algorithm. Furthermore, the well-known reduction from the weighted $k$-Set
Packing Problem to the Maximum Weight Independent Set Problem in $k+1$-claw
free graphs provides a
$\frac{k+1}{2}-\frac{1}{63,700,992}+\epsilon$-approximation algorithm for the

drag and investigate the control effects of uniform blowing and suction applied
to a NACA4412 airfoil at chord Reynolds numbers Re_c=200,000 and 400,000. The
connection of the drag reduction/increase by using blowing/suction with the
turbulence statistics (including viscous dissipation, turbulence-kinetic-energy
production, and spatial growth of the flow) across the boundary layer,
subjected to adverse or favorable pressure gradients, are examined. We found
that the peaks of the statistics associated with the friction-drag generation
exhibit good scaling in either inner or outer units throughout the boundary
layer. They are also independent of the Reynolds number, control scheme, and
intensity of the blowing/suction. The small- and large-scale structures are
separated with an adaptive scale-decomposition method, i.e. empirical mode
decomposition (EMD), aiming to analyze the scale-specific contribution of
turbulent motions to friction-drag generation. Results unveil that blowing on
the suction side of the airfoil is able to enhance the contribution of
large-scale motions and to suppress that of small-scales; on the other hand,
suction behaves contrarily. The contributions related to cross-scale

remained unchallenged for both problems. Recently, it was improved by
Neuwohner, obtaining an approximation guarantee slightly below $\frac{d}{2}$,
and inevitably raising the question of how far one can get by using local
search. In this paper, we finally answer this question asymptotically in the
following sense: By considering local improvements of logarithmic size, we
obtain approximation ratios of $\frac{d-1+\epsilon_d}{2}$ for the MWIS in
$d$-claw free graphs for $d\geq 3$ in quasi-polynomial time, where $0\leq
\epsilon_d\leq 1$ and $\lim_{d\rightarrow\infty}\epsilon_d = 0$. By employing
the color coding technique, we can use the previous result to obtain a
polynomial time $\frac{k+\epsilon_{k+1}}{2}$-approximation for weighted $k$-Set
Packing. On the other hand, we provide examples showing that no local
improvement algorithm considering local improvements of size
$\mathcal{O}(\log(|\mathcal{S}|))$ with respect to some power $w^\alpha$ of the
weight function, where $\alpha\in\mathbb{R}$ is chosen arbitrarily, but fixed,
can yield an approximation guarantee better than $\frac{k}{2}$ for the weighted

directly from the segmentation of deconvolved images from SDO/HMI. To perform
the segmentation, we define granules as convex elements of images. We measured
an approximately 2% variation in the density and the mean area of granules over

smaller granule mean area. The maximum density appears to be delayed by about
one year compared to classical activity indicators, such as the sunspot number.

samples from raw data, holds vast potential to improve recommender systems.
Most existing SSL-based methods perturb the raw data graph with uniform
node/edge dropout to generate new data views and then conduct the
self-discrimination based contrastive learning over different views to learn
generalizable representations. Under this scheme, only a bijective mapping is
built between nodes in two different views, which means that the
self-supervision signals from other nodes are being neglected. Due to the
widely observed homophily in recommender systems, we argue that the supervisory
signals from other nodes are also highly likely to benefit the representation
learning for recommendation. To capture these signals, a general socially-aware
SSL framework that integrates tri-training is proposed in this paper.
Technically, our framework first augments the user data views with the user
social information. And then under the regime of tri-training for multi-view
encoding, the framework builds three graph encoders (one for recommendation)
upon the augmented views and iteratively improves each encoder with
self-supervision signals from other users, generated by the other two encoders.
Since the tri-training operates on the augmented views of the same data sources
for self-supervision signals, we name it self-supervised tri-training.
Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets consistently validate the
effectiveness of the self-supervised tri-training framework for improving
recommendation. The code is released at https://github.com/Coder-Yu/QRec.

measured two components of the transverse polarization ($\sigma_{T_{1}}$,

sensitive to physics beyond the Standard Model. The value of time-reversal odd

formally considered as a variant of Optimistic Mirror Descent
\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/MertikopoulosLZ19}, uses a large learning rate for the
intermediate gradient step which essentially leads to computing (approximate)
best response strategies against the profile of the previous iteration.
Although counter-intuitive at first sight due to the irrationally large, for an
iterative algorithm, intermediate learning step, we prove that the method
guarantees last-iterate convergence to an equilibrium. Particularly, we show
that the algorithm reaches first an $\eta^{1/\rho}$-approximate Nash
equilibrium, with $\rho > 1$, by decreasing the Kullback-Leibler divergence of
each iterate by at least $\Omega(\eta^{1+\frac{1}{\rho}})$, for sufficiently
small learning rate, $\eta$, until the method becomes a contracting map, and
converges to the exact equilibrium. Furthermore, we perform experimental
comparisons with the optimistic variant of the multiplicative weights update
method, by \cite{Daskalakis2019LastIterateCZ} and show that our algorithm has
significant practical potential since it offers substantial gains in terms of

Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of incompressible flows. The algorithm
combines the versatility of a multi-block solver with the method of
eigenfunctions expansions, to speedup the solution of the pressure Poisson
equation. This is achieved by employing FFT-based transforms along one
homogeneous direction, which effectively reduce the problem complexity at a low
cost. These FFT-based expansions are implemented in a framework that unifies
all valid combinations of boundary conditions for this type of method.
Subsequently, a geometric multigrid solver is employed to solve the reduced
Poisson equation in a multi-block geometry. Particular care was taken here, to
guarantee the parallel performance of the multigrid solver when solving the
reduced linear systems equations. We have validated the overall numerical
algorithm and assessed its performance in a massively parallel setting. The
results show that 2- to 8-fold reductions in computational cost may be easily
achieved when exploiting FFT acceleration for the solution of the Poisson
equation. The solver, SNaC, has been made freely available and open-source

a local objective function, and communicate using gossip-based methods in order
to minimize the average of these per-node functions. While synchronous
algorithms are heavily impacted by a few slow nodes or edges in the graph (the
\emph{straggler problem}), their asynchronous counterparts are notoriously
harder to parametrize. Indeed, their convergence properties for networks with
heterogeneous communication and computation delays have defied analysis so far.
  In this paper, we use a \emph{ continuized} framework to analyze asynchronous
algorithms in networks with delays. Our approach yields a precise
characterization of convergence time and of its dependency on heterogeneous
delays in the network. Our continuized framework benefits from the best of both
continuous and discrete worlds: the algorithms it applies to are based on
event-driven updates. They are thus essentially discrete and hence readily
implementable. Yet their analysis is essentially in continuous time, relying in
part on the theory of delayed ODEs.
  Our algorithms moreover achieve an \emph{asynchronous speedup}: their rate of
convergence is controlled by the eigengap of the network graph weighted by
local delays, instead of the network-wide worst-case delay as in previous
analyses. Our methods thus enjoy improved robustness to stragglers.

models of quantum gravity that seek to unify quantum mechanics and gravitation.
Recently, Perivolaropoulos in his seminal work [Phys. Rev.D 95, 103523 (2017)]
predicted the simultaneous existence of minimal and maximal length measurements
of quantum gravity. More recently, we have shown that both measurable lengths
can be obtained from position-dependent noncommutativity [J. Phys. A:
Math.Theor. 53, 115303 (2020)]. In this paper, we present an alternative
derivation of these lengths from non-Hermitian position-dependent
noncommutativity. We show that a simultaneous measurement of both lengths form
a family of discrete spaces. In one hand, we show the similarities between the
maximal uncertainty measurement and the classical properties of gravity. On the
other hand, the connection between the minimal uncertainties and the
non-Hermicity quantum mechanic scenarios. The existence of minimal
uncertainties are the consequences of non-Hermicities of some operators that
are generators of this noncommutativity. With an appropriate Dyson map, we
demonstrate by a similarity transformation that the physically meaningfulness
of dynamical quantum systems is generated by a hidden Hermitian
position-dependent noncommutativity. This transformation preserves the
properties of quantum gravity but removes the fuzziness induced by minimal
uncertainty measurements at this scale. Finally, we study the eigenvalue
problem of a free particle in a square-well potential in these new Hermitian
variables.

and other operational theories. After having introduced the framework of
operational theories, we consider a communication scheme based on an
experimental prepare-and-measure scenario and demonstrate this with different
communication tasks. This gives us context for how the different communication
tasks can be implemented in different theories, in doing so establishing
quantum theory intuitively as an operational theory among other theories. The
main property of measurements we focus on in this work is the simulation of
measurements, which consists of manipulating the inputs and outputs of the
measurement devices. We study how using this process on existing measurement
devices can be used to operationally imitate new devices, and what kind of
structure the simulation process induces on measurements. We also consider
applications of simulability. Firstly, we consider operational restrictions
imposed upon measurements. We argue that the restricted set of physical
measurements must be closed with respect to the simulation process since the
simulation of physical devices must lead to other physically feasible devices.
We demonstrate different types of restrictions by classifying them. As a second
application we see how the simulation of measurements relates to compatibility
of measurements and how it can be viewed as a generalisation of it. This allows
us to present an operational principle previously known to quantum theory, the
no-free-information principle, according to which any measurement that is
compatible with all other measurement must not provide any useful, and
therefore free, information about the system. Whilst this principle holds in
quantum theory, there are non-classical theories for which it is violated, and
so enforcing this principle may be considered a way to exclude some unphysical
theories.

  Significant updates. Introduction of nonparametric methods",,,,"math.OC cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A key assumption in the theory of nonlinear adaptive control is that the
uncertainty of the system can be expressed in the linear span of a set of known
basis functions. While this assumption leads to efficient algorithms, it limits
applications to very specific classes of systems. We introduce a novel
nonparametric adaptive algorithm that estimates an infinite-dimensional density
over parameters online to learn an unknown dynamics in a reproducing kernel
Hilbert space. Surprisingly, the resulting control input admits an analytical
expression that enables its implementation despite its underlying
infinite-dimensional structure. While this adaptive input is rich and
expressive - subsuming, for example, traditional linear parameterizations - its
computational complexity grows linearly with time, making it comparatively more
expensive than its parametric counterparts. Leveraging the theory of random
Fourier features, we provide an efficient randomized implementation that
recovers the complexity of classical parametric methods while provably
retaining the expressivity of the nonparametric input. In particular, our
explicit bounds only depend polynomially on the underlying parameters of the
system, allowing our proposed algorithms to efficiently scale to
high-dimensional systems. As an illustration of the method, we demonstrate the
ability of the randomized approximation algorithm to learn a predictive model
of a 60-dimensional system consisting of ten point masses interacting through
Newtonian gravitation. By reinterpretation as a gradient flow on a specific
loss, we conclude with a natural extension of our kernel-based adaptive
algorithms to deep neural networks. We show empirically that the extra
expressivity afforded by deep representations can lead to improved performance
at the expense of closed-loop stability that is rigorously guaranteed and
consistently observed for kernel machines.

Magnetic fields with intensities $5\times 10^{16}$ G and $5\times 10 ^{17}$ G
are considered. It is shown that the effect on the extension of the crust-core
transition is washed away for temperatures above $10^{9}$ K for magnetic field

field as high as $5\times 10 ^{17}$G is considered. For temperatures below that
value, the effect of the magnetic field on crust-core transition is noticeable
and grows as the temperature decreases and, in particular, it is interesting to
identify the existence of disconnected non-homogeneous matter above the $B=0$
crust core transition density. Models with different symmetry energy slopes at
saturation show quite different behaviors. In particular, a model with a large
slope, as suggested by the recent results of PREX-2, predicts the existence of

and the study of its globular clusters (GCs) is important to understand the
history and outcome of this ongoing process. Aims. Our main goal is to
characterize the GC system of the Sgr dwarf galaxy. This task is hampered by
high foreground stellar contamination, mostly from the Galactic bulge. Methods.
We performed a GC search specifically tailored to find new GC members within
the main body of this dwarf galaxy using the combined data of the VISTA
Variables in the Via Lactea Extended Survey (VVVX) near-infrared survey and the
Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) optical database. Results. We applied proper
motion (PM) cuts to discard foreground bulge and disk stars, and we found a
number of GC candidates in the main body of the Sgr dwarf galaxy. We selected
the best GCs as those objects that have significant overdensities above the
stellar background of the Sgr galaxy and that possess color-magnitude diagrams
(CMDs) with well-defined red giant branches (RGBs) consistent with the distance
and reddening of this galaxy. Conclusions. We discover eight new GC members of
the Sgr galaxy, which adds up to 29 total GCs known in this dwarf galaxy. This
total number of GCs shows that the Sgr dwarf galaxy hosts a rather rich GC
system. Most of the new GCs appear to be predominantly metal-rich and have low
luminosity. In addition, we identify ten other GC candidates that are more
uncertain and need more data for proper confirmation.

new model structure modeling $\infty$-bicategories, which we show is Quillen

environment to provide high-quality services to their users. Dynamic game
theory provides an expressive theoretical framework for modeling scenarios
involving multiple agents with differing objectives interacting over time. A
core challenge when formulating a dynamic game is designing objectives for each
agent that capture desired behavior. In this paper, we propose a method for
inferring parametric objective models of multiple agents based on observed
interactions. Our inverse game solver jointly optimizes player objectives and
continuous-state estimates by coupling them through Nash equilibrium
constraints. Hence, our method is able to directly maximize the observation
likelihood rather than other non-probabilistic surrogate criteria. Our method
does not require full observations of game states or player strategies to
identify player objectives. Instead, it robustly recovers this information from
noisy, partial state observations. As a byproduct of estimating player
objectives, our method computes a Nash equilibrium trajectory corresponding to
those objectives. Thus, it is suitable for downstream trajectory forecasting
tasks. We demonstrate our method in several simulated traffic scenarios.
Results show that it reliably estimates player objectives from a short sequence
of noise-corrupted partial state observations. Furthermore, using the estimated
objectives, our method makes accurate predictions of each player's trajectory.

Candidate Attack and Query Attack, that can raise or lower the rank of chosen
candidates by adversarial perturbations. Specifically, the expected ranking
order is first represented as a set of inequalities, and then a triplet-like
objective function is designed to obtain the optimal perturbation. Conversely,
an anti-collapse triplet defense is proposed to improve the ranking model
robustness against all proposed attacks, where the model learns to prevent the
positive and negative samples being pulled close to each other by adversarial
attack. To comprehensively measure the empirical adversarial robustness of a
ranking model with our defense, we propose an empirical robustness score, which
involves a set of representative attacks against ranking models. Our
adversarial ranking attacks and defenses are evaluated on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST,

results demonstrate that a typical deep ranking system can be effectively

spectra of the PDS70 planetary system with the SINFONI integral field
spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope. We applied molecular mapping, based
on cross-correlation with synthetic spectra, to identify signatures of
molecular species in the atmosphere of the planet. Results. Although the planet
emission is clearly detected when resampling the data to lower resolution, no
molecular species could be identified with the cross-correlation technique. We
estimated upper limits on the abundances of H$_2$O, CO and CH$_4$
($\log(X_\mathrm{mol}) < -4.0$, $-4.1$ and $-4.9$, respectively) assuming a
clear atmosphere, and we explored the impact of clouds, which increase the
upper limits by a factor up to 0.7 dex. Assuming that the observations directly
probe the planet's atmosphere, we found a lack of molecular species compared to
other directly imaged companions or field objects. Under the assumption that
the planet atmosphere presents similar characteristics to other directly imaged
planets, we conclude that a dusty environment surrounds the planet, effectively
obscuring any feature generated in its atmosphere. We quantify the extinction
necessary to impede the detection ($A_V\approx16-17$ mag), pointing to the
possibility of higher optical thickness than previously estimated from other
studies. Finally, the non-detection of molecular species conflicts with
atmospheric models previously proposed to describe the forming planet.
Conclusions. To unveil how giant planets form, a comprehensive approach that
includes constraints from multiple techniques needs to be undertaken. Molecular
mapping emerges as an alternative to more classical techniques like SED
fitting.

is complex, we derive a newly fitting expression (NASR) for the expression of
traditional approximate SR (TASR), which has simpler closed-form and more
convenient for subsequent optimization. Based on the above two fitting
expressions, three beamforming methods, called maximizing NASR via successive

the Hyperbolic Graph Convolutional Networks (HGCNs) to learn structural
representations of entities. Regarding the visual information, we generate
image embeddings using the densenet model, which are also projected into the
hyperbolic space using HGCNs. Finally, we combine the structure and visual

predict potential alignment results. Extensive experiments and ablation studies
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model and its components.

desired performance requirements. The conventional design process, which
requires iterative optimization and performance evaluation, is slow and
dependent on initial designs. Past work has used conditional generative
adversarial networks (cGANs) to enable direct design synthesis for given target
performances. However, most existing cGANs are restricted to categorical
conditions. Recent work on Continuous conditional GAN (CcGAN) tries to address
this problem, but still faces two challenges: 1) it performs poorly on
non-uniform performance distributions, and 2) the generated designs may not
cover the entire design space. We propose a new model, named Performance
Conditioned Diverse Generative Adversarial Network (PcDGAN), which introduces a
singular vicinal loss combined with a Determinantal Point Processes (DPP) based
loss function to enhance diversity. PcDGAN uses a new self-reinforcing score
called the Lambert Log Exponential Transition Score (LLETS) for improved
conditioning. Experiments on synthetic problems and a real-world airfoil design
problem demonstrate that PcDGAN outperforms state-of-the-art GAN models and
improves the conditioning likelihood by 69% in an airfoil generation task and
up to 78% in synthetic conditional generation tasks and achieves greater design
space coverage. The proposed method enables efficient design synthesis and
design space exploration with applications ranging from CAD model generation to
metamaterial selection.

key inductive biases. In this work, we introduce EfficientMORL, an efficient

show that optimization challenges caused by requiring both symmetry and
disentanglement can in fact be addressed by high-cost iterative amortized
inference by designing the framework to minimize its dependence on it. We take
a two-stage approach to inference: first, a hierarchical variational
autoencoder extracts symmetric and disentangled representations through
bottom-up inference, and second, a lightweight network refines the
representations with top-down feedback. The number of refinement steps taken
during training is reduced following a curriculum, so that at test time with
zero steps the model achieves 99.1% of the refined decomposition performance.
We demonstrate strong object decomposition and disentanglement on the standard

hopefully behave equally well on a target domain. In other words, the invariant
features are \emph{transferable}. However, in practice, there are no perfectly
transferable features, and some algorithms seem to learn ""more transferable""
features than others. How can we understand and quantify such
\emph{transferability}? In this paper, we formally define transferability that
one can quantify and compute in domain generalization. We point out the
difference and connection with common discrepancy measures between domains,
such as total variation and Wasserstein distance. We then prove that our
transferability can be estimated with enough samples and give a new upper bound
for the target error based on our transferability. Empirically, we evaluate the
transferability of the feature embeddings learned by existing algorithms for
domain generalization. Surprisingly, we find that many algorithms are not quite

key role of the three low energy metal-based vibrations in mediating the
spin-lattice relaxation times (T1). The temperature dependence of T1 can thus
be normalized by the frequencies of these low energy vibrations to show an

signals is an all but trivial problem, with, to-date, no generally applicable
solution. In this work, we present Deep Canonical Correlation Alignment (DCCA),
a novel, generally applicable solution for the temporal alignment of raw

selection of artificial and real datasets, we demonstrate the performance and
utility of DCCA under a variety of conditions. We compare the DCCA algorithm to
other warping based methods, DCCA outperforms dynamic time warping and cross

DCCA performs especially well on almost periodic biomedical signals such as
heart-beats and breathing patterns. In comparison to existing approaches, that
are not tailored towards raw sensor data, DCCA is not only fast enough to work
on signals with billions of data points but also provides automatic filtering

for current optical networks. The use of gain-flattening filters (GFFs)
simplifies the problem at the cost of insertion loss, higher power consumption

model of a multi-span transmission system for signal-to-noise (SNR)
optimization. A machine-learning based model is trained for the gain and noise
figure spectral profile of a C-band amplifier without a GFF. The model is
combined with the Gaussian noise model for nonlinearities in optical fibers
including stimulated Raman scattering and the implementation penalty spectral
profile measured in back-to-back in order to predict the SNR in each channel of
a multi-span wavelength division multiplexed system. All basic components in
the system model are differentiable and allow for the gradient descent-based
optimization of a system of arbitrary configuration in terms of number of spans
and length per span. When the input power profile is optimized for flat and
maximized received SNR per channel, the minimum performance in an arbitrary
3-span experimental system is improved by up to 8 dB w.r.t. a system with flat
input power profile. An SNR flatness down to 1.2 dB is simultaneously achieved.
The model and optimization methods are used to optimize the performance of an
example core network, and 0.2 dB of gain is shown w.r.t. solutions that do not
take into account nonlinearities. The method is also shown to be beneficial for
systems with ideal gain flattening, achieving up to 0.3 dB of gain w.r.t. a
flat input power profile.

fever is continuously rising. In the context, we aim to address the most

uses a randomized controlled design to estimate internally valid estimates.
Using data from 200 dairy farms, results indicate that milk fever incidence
decreases from 21 per cent at baseline to 2 per cent in treated animals at
follow-up. Further, AMM leads to a 12 per cent and 38 per cent increase in milk

prevention of milk fever [INR 16000 (USD 218.7)] overweighs the losses from
milk fever [INR 4000 (USD 54.7)]; thus, prevention using AMM is better than

feature-less environment with such low-cost 2D LiDARs remains a challenge. The
challenge mainly originates from the short-range of LiDARs and complexities in
performing scan matching in these environments. In order to resolve these
shortcomings, we propose to fuse the ultra-wideband (UWB) with 2D LiDARs to
improve the mapping quality of a mobile robot. The optimization-based approach
is utilized for the fusion of UWB ranging information and odometry to first
optimize the trajectory. Then the LiDAR-based loop closures are incorporated to
improve the accuracy of the trajectory estimation. Finally, the optimized
trajectory is combined with the LiDAR scans to produce the occupancy map of the
environment. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated in an indoor
feature-less environment with a size of 20m*20m. Obtained results show that the
mapping error of the proposed scheme is 85.5% less than that of the
conventional GMapping algorithm with short-range LiDAR (for example Hokuyo

naturality of the associator is the true obstruction to strictification. We

essential. Hierarchical methods inspired by human navigation have been
proposed, typically consisting of a high-level landmark proposer and a
low-level controller. However, these methods either require precise high-level
information to be given in advance or need to construct such guidance from
extensive interaction with the environment. In this work, we propose an
approach that leverages a rough 2-D map of the environment to navigate in novel
environments without requiring further learning. In particular, we introduce a
dynamic topological map that can be initialized from the rough 2-D map along
with a high-level planning approach for proposing reachable 2-D map patches of
the intermediate landmarks between the start and goal locations. To use
proposed 2-D patches, we train a deep generative model to generate intermediate
landmarks in observation space which are used as subgoals by low-level
goal-conditioned reinforcement learning. Importantly, because the low-level
controller is only trained with local behaviors (e.g. go across the
intersection, turn left at a corner) on existing environments, this framework
allows us to generalize to novel environments given only a rough 2-D map,
without requiring further learning. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework in both seen and novel environments.

evolutionary processes of biological organisms but also to design engineering
systems such as genetic algorithms and particle filters. There is a surge of
interest, both from biology and engineering, in considering natural selection
of intellectual agents that can learn individually. Learning by individual
agents of better behaviors for survival may accelerate the evolutionary
processes by natural selection. We have accumulating pieces of evidence that
organisms can transmit its information to the next generation via epigenetic
states or memes. Also, such idea is important for engineering applications. To
accelerate the evolutionary process, an agent should change their strategy so
that the population fitness increases the most. Equivalently, an agent should
update the strategy towards a gradient of the population fitness. However, it
has not yet been clarified whether and how an agent can estimate the gradient
and accelerate the evolutionary process. We also lack methodology to quantify
the acceleration to understand and predict the impact of learning. In this
paper, we address these problems. We show that an learning agent can accelerate
the evolutionary process by proposing ancestral learning, which uses the
information transmitted from the ancestor (ancestral information). We next show
that the ancestral information is sufficient to estimate the gradient. In
particular, learning can accelerate the evolutionary process without
communications between agents. Finally, to quantify the acceleration, we extend
the Fisher's fundamental theorem (FF-thm) for natural selection to ancestral
learning. Our extended FF-thm relates the acceleration of the evolutionary
process to the variety of individual fitness of the agent. By the theorem, we
can quantitatively understand when and why learning is beneficial.

Experiments indicate that E. coli controls replication initiation via titration
and activation of the initiator protein DnaA. Here, we study by mathematical
modelling how these two mechanisms interact to generate robust
replication-initiation cycles. We first show that a mechanism solely based on
titration generates stable replication cycles at low growth rates, but
inevitably causes premature reinitiation events at higher growth rates. In this
regime, the DnaA activation switch becomes essential for stable replication
initiation. Conversely, while the activation switch alone yields robust rhythms
at high growth rates, titration can strongly enhance the stability of the
switch at low growth rates. Our analysis thus predicts that both mechanisms
together drive robust replication cycles at all growth rates. In addition, it
reveals how an origin-density sensor yields adder correlations.

based on multivariate long division. The runtime of each step of the algorithm
is typically dominated by a series of polynomial additions, and the total
number of these additions is a hardware independent performance metric that is
often used to evaluate and optimize various implementation choices. In this
work we attempt to predict, using just the starting input, the number of
polynomial additions that take place during one run of Buchberger's algorithm.
Good predictions are useful for quickly estimating difficulty and understanding
what features make Gr\""obner basis computation hard. Our features and methods
could also be used for value models in the reinforcement learning approach to
optimize Buchberger's algorithm introduced in [Peifer, Stillman, and

additions somewhat well, better than an uninformed model, and better than
regression models built on some intuitive commutative algebra invariants that
are more difficult to compute. We also train a simple recursive neural network

strategy can improve upon the Trotter-Suzuki accuracy by several orders of

overall fidelity at the same algorithmic accuracy. This is important in
NISQ-applications where the fidelity of the output state decays exponentially
with the number of gates. The performance advantage of our classical assisted

bring about a desired or targeted outcome. Direct Intention is not always

unpunished which were not the aim of the actor, but were natural consequences
nevertheless. This paper uses a canonical example of a plane owner, planting a

learning paradigms -- unsupervised, reinforcement, and supervised -- take place
in respectively the cortex, the basal-ganglia, and the cerebellum. However,
dopamine outbursts, usually assumed to encode reward, are not limited to the
basal ganglia but also reach prefrontal, motor, and higher sensory cortices. We
propose that in the cortex the same reward-based trial-and-error processes
might support not only the acquisition of motor representations but also of
sensory representations. In particular, reward signals might guide
trial-and-error processes that mix with associative learning processes to
support the acquisition of representations better serving downstream action
selection. We tested the soundness of this hypothesis with a computational
model that integrates unsupervised learning (Contrastive Divergence) and
reinforcement learning (REINFORCE). The model was tested with a task requiring
different responses to different visual images grouped in categories involving
either colour, shape, or size. Results show that a balanced mix of unsupervised
and reinforcement learning processes leads to the best performance. Indeed,
excessive unsupervised learning tends to under-represent task-relevant features
while excessive reinforcement learning tends to initially learn slowly and then
to incur in local minima. These results stimulate future empirical studies on
category learning directed to investigate similar effects in the extrastriate
visual cortices. Moreover, they prompt further computational investigations

present detailed analyses of X-ray emission from a Swift/XRT observation in
2009 and the most recent XMM-Newton/pn observation in 2020. The two spectra can
be modeled with hard and soft components. While no significant variability is
detected in the hard component above 2 keV between these two observations, the
soft X-ray emission in 0.3-2 keV varies by a factor of $\sim5$. The luminosity
of this soft component fades from $\sim1.8\times10^{41}$ to
$\sim3.7\times10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$ from the observation in Swift to that of
XMM-Newton, which are 8 and 19 years after the outburst occurred, respectively.
The evolution of luminosity matches with the $t^{-5/3}$ decline law well; there
is a soft X-ray peak luminosity of 10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at the time of the
optical flare. Furthermore, the spectra of the soft component harden slightly
in the decay phase, in which the photon index $\Gamma$ varies from
$4.8^{+1.2}_{-0.9}$ to $3.7\pm0.5$, although they are consistent with each
other if we consider the uncertainties. Additionally, by comparing the BH mass
estimate between the $M-\sigma$ correlation, the broad H$\alpha$ emission, and
the fundamental plane relation of BH accretion, we find that a value of
$\sim10^{5}$Msun is favored. If so, taking its X-ray spectral variation,
luminosity evolution, and further support from theory into account, we suggest
that SDSS J134244.4+053056 is a long-lived tidal disruption event candidate

separating how uncertain the state of the world manifests to us via measurement
(objective end) from the way this gets scrambled with the model specification
and training procedure used to predict such state (subjective means) -- e.g.,
number of neurons, depth, connections, priors (if the model is bayesian),
weight initialization, etc. This poses the question of the extent to which one
can eliminate the degrees of freedom associated with these specifications and
still being able to capture the objective end. Here, a novel non-parametric
quantile estimation method for continuous random variables is introduced, based
on the simplest neural network architecture with one degree of freedom: a
single neuron. Its advantage is first shown in synthetic experiments comparing
with the quantile estimation achieved from ranking the order statistics
(specifically for small sample size) and with quantile regression. In
real-world applications, the method can be used to quantify predictive
uncertainty under the split conformal prediction setting, whereby prediction
intervals are estimated from the residuals of a pre-trained model on a held-out
validation set and then used to quantify the uncertainty in future predictions
-- the single neuron used here as a structureless ``thermometer'' that measures
how uncertain the pre-trained model is. Benchmarking regression and
classification experiments demonstrate that the method is competitive in

estimate the full number- and corresponding energy-density profile of a spin-1
Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) for a number of particles as low as 500 under
harmonic confinement. To apply this method, we consider a system of spin-1 BEC
under three-dimensional isotropic and effective one-dimensional harmonic
confinement in the absence (negligible presence) of the magnetic field which
has ground state candidates of comparable energy. It should be noted that in
such circumstances kinetic energy contribution to the ground state cannot be
neglected which puts the applicability of Thomas-Fermi approximation to
question. For anti-ferromagnetic condensates, the T-F approximated energy
difference between the competing stationary states (ground state and the first
excited state) is approximately 0.3\%. As T-F approximation is only good for
condensates with a large number of particles, T-F approximated predictions can
completely go wrong especially for small condensates. This is where comes the
role of a detailed analysis using our variational method, which incorporates
the kinetic energy contribution and accurately estimates the number- and
energy-density profile even for condensates having a small number of particles.
Results of our analytical method are supported by numerical simulation. This
variational method is general and can be extended to other
similar/higher-dimensional problems to get results beyond the accuracy of the
Thomas-Fermi approximation.

consistent/unbiased plans by solving large-scale constrained optimization
problems sequentially. If the clinical criteria changes, a new training data

changes in the clinical practice. We used 120 conventional lung patients (100

Furthermore, the metrics are assessed in different settings, to better qualify
their respective strengths and weaknesses. Metrics are assessed (1) on both the
turn level and the dialog level, (2) for different dialog lengths, (3) for
different dialog qualities (e.g., coherence, engaging), (4) for different types

neutron star mergers (NSM) can be a site of the r-process. Several studies of
galactic chemical evolution, however, have pointed out inconsistencies between
this idea and the observed stellar abundance signatures in the Milky Way: (a)
the presence of Eu at low (halo) metallicity and (b) the descending trend of
Eu/Fe at high (disc) metallicity. In this study, we explore the galactic
chemical evolution of the Milky Way's halo, disc and satellite dwarf galaxies.
Particular attention is payed to the forms of delay-time distributions for both
type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) and NSMs. The Galactic halo is modeled as an
ensemble of independently evolving building-block galaxies with different
masses. The single building blocks as well as the disc and satellite dwarfs are
treated as well-mixed one-zone systems. Our results indicate that the
aforementioned inconsistencies can be resolved and thus NSMs can be the unique
r-process site in the Milky Way, provided that the delay-time distributions
satisfy the following conditions: (i) a long delay (~1 Gyr) for the appearance
of the first SN Ia (or a slow early increase of its number) and (ii) an
additional early component providing >~ 50% of all NSMs with a delay of ~0.1
Gyr. In our model, r-process-enhanced and r-process-deficient stars in the halo
appear to have originated from ultra-faint dwarf-sized and massive building
blocks, respectively. Our results also imply that the natal kicks of binary
neutron stars have a little impact on the evolution of Eu in the disc.

model based on the principle of minimum dissipation potential with nonconvex
boundary energy, along with a stochastic model for thermal nucleation of
disconnection pairs. In this model, disconnections arise spontaneously in the
presence of an elastic driving force, and that their motion mediates boundary
migration. The effect is due to the fact that the formation of the
disconnections pairs results in a stress concentration, causing the elastic
driving force to exceed the threshold value and driving the propagation of the
disconnection along the interface. The model is applied to study the
propagation/annihilation of single disconnection pairs, the relaxation of a
perturbed interface, and shear coupling at various temperatures. The results
are consistent with the current understanding of disconnections, and capture
the effect of thermal softening.

the kinematics is reduced to two copies of $G(2,n)/T \sim A_{n{-}3}$. In the
simplest octagon case, we conjecture that all loop amplitudes and Feynman
integrals are given in terms of two overlapping $A_2$ functions (a special case
of two-dimensional harmonic polylogarithms): in addition to the letters $v,

the two sectors but they never appear together in the same term; these are the
reduced version of four-mass-box algebraic letters. Evidence supporting our
conjecture includes all known octagon amplitudes as well as new computations of
multi-loop integrals in reduced kinematics. By leveraging this alphabet and
conditions on first and last entries, we initiate a bootstrap program in
reduced kinematics: within the remarkably simple space of overlapping $A_2$
functions, we easily obtain octagon amplitudes up to two-loop NMHV and
three-loop MHV. We also briefly comment on the generalization to $2n$-gons in

related to the Laplace operator subject to any standard type of homogeneous
boundary conditions have no outliers in certain optimal spline subspaces.
Roughly speaking, these optimal subspaces are obtained from the full spline
space defined on certain uniform knot sequences by imposing specific additional
boundary conditions. The spline subspaces of interest have been introduced in
the literature some years ago when proving their optimality with respect to
Kolmogorov $n$-widths in $L^2$-norm for some function classes. The
eigenfunctions of the Laplacian -- with any standard type of homogeneous
boundary conditions -- belong to such classes. Here we complete the analysis of
the approximation properties of these optimal spline subspaces. In particular,
we provide explicit $L^2$ and $H^1$ error estimates with full approximation
order for Ritz projectors in the univariate and in the multivariate
tensor-product setting. Besides their intrinsic interest, these estimates imply
that, for a fixed number of degrees of freedom, all the eigenfunctions and the
corresponding eigenvalues are well approximated, without loss of accuracy in
the whole spectrum when compared to the full spline space. Moreover, there are
no spurious values in the approximated spectrum. In other words, the considered
subspaces provide accurate outlier-free discretizations in the univariate and
in the multivariate tensor-product case. This main contribution is complemented
by an explicit construction of B-spline-like bases for the considered spline
subspaces. The role of such spaces as accurate discretization spaces for
addressing general problems with non-homogeneous boundary behavior is discussed
as well.

eddy-viscosity closure models for turbulent flows, focusing on the Leith model
for 2D {Large-Eddy Simulation}. Optimal eddy viscosities depending on the
magnitude of the vorticity gradient are determined subject to minimum
assumptions by solving PDE-constrained optimization problems defined such that
the corresponding optimal Large-Eddy Simulation best matches the filtered
Direct Numerical Simulation. First, we consider pointwise match in the physical
space and the main finding is that with a fixed cutoff wavenumber $k_c$, the
performance of the Large-Eddy Simulation systematically improves as the
regularization in the solution of the optimization problem is reduced and this
is achieved with the optimal eddy viscosities exhibiting increasingly irregular
behavior with rapid oscillations. Since the optimal eddy viscosities do not
converge to a well-defined limit as the regularization vanishes, we conclude
that in this case the problem of finding an optimal eddy viscosity does not in
fact have a solution and is thus ill-posed. We argue that this observation is
consistent with the physical intuition concerning closure problems. The second
problem we consider involves matching time-averaged vorticity spectra over
small wavenumbers. It is shown to be better behaved and to produce physically
reasonable optimal eddy viscosities. We conclude that while better behaved and
hence practically more useful eddy viscosities can be obtained with stronger
regularization or by matching quantities defined in a statistical sense, the
corresponding Large-Eddy Simulations will not achieve their theoretical
performance limits.

standard uptake value ratio parameters in the brain lobes. The comparison
between attenuation correction strategies represented that MRAC images resulted
in underestimation of the ACC values which was more substantial in the cortical
area rather than in central regions (maximum 9% vs. 6% for 2C-MR and maximum
5.5% vs. 3.5% for 3C-MR). Nevertheless, there was a strong correlation between

the fact that the signal-to-noise is constructed through an optimisation
operation on noisy data, and hold even if the cluster signal is modelled
perfectly well, no foregrounds are present, and the noise is Gaussian. After
reviewing the general mathematical formalism underlying matched filters, we
study the statistics of the signal-to-noise with a set Monte Carlo mock

present, the majority of Person re-ID techniques are based on Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs), but Vision Transformers are beginning to displace pure
CNNs for a variety of object recognition tasks. The primary output of a vision
transformer is a global classification token, but vision transformers also
yield local tokens which contain additional information about local regions of
the image. Techniques to make use of these local tokens to improve
classification accuracy are an active area of research. We propose a novel
Locally Aware Transformer (LA-Transformer) that employs a Parts-based
Convolution Baseline (PCB)-inspired strategy for aggregating globally enhanced
local classification tokens into an ensemble of $\sqrt{N}$ classifiers, where
$N$ is the number of patches. An additional novelty is that we incorporate
blockwise fine-tuning which further improves re-ID accuracy. LA-Transformer
with blockwise fine-tuning achieves rank-1 accuracy of $98.27 \%$ with standard

generalization, our understanding of the data used to train and evaluate these
algorithms remains stagnant. In this work, we first identify and measure two
distinct kinds of distribution shifts that are ubiquitous in various datasets.
Next, through extensive experiments, we compare OoD generalization algorithms
across two groups of benchmarks, each dominated by one of the distribution
shifts, revealing their strengths on one shift as well as limitations on the
other shift. Overall, we position existing datasets and algorithms from
different research areas seemingly unconnected into the same coherent picture.
It may serve as a foothold that can be resorted to by future OoD generalization

generalizes known stability properties of graph filters and GNNs and it is also
a generalization of known stability properties of standard convolutional

on sequence alignment. The algorithm performs mutual matching of two random
sequences by successively searching for common elements and by applying
sequence breaks to matchless elements in the function of exponential cost. As a
result, sequences varying significantly generate a high-cost alignment, while
for low-cost sequences the introduced interruptions allow inferring the nature
of sequences dependence. The most important advantage of the algorithm is an
easy interpretation of the obtained results based on two parameters: stretch
ratio and stretch cost. The operation of the method has been simulation tested
and verified with the use of real data obtained from hardware random number
generators. The proposed solution ensures simple implementation enabling the
integration of hardware solutions, and operation based on only two sequences of
any length predisposes the method to online testing.

comparison with the data, as substantial computing resources are required to
produce and store such samples. One solution often employed when producing MC
samples for HEP experiments is to partition the phase space of particle
interactions into multiple regions and produce the MC samples separately for
each region. This approach allows to adapt the size of the MC samples to the
needs of physics analyses that are performed in these regions. In this paper we
present a procedure for combining MC samples that overlap in phase space. The
procedure is based on applying suitably chosen weights to the simulated events.

first from red giants (RGs) with degenerate cores via stable mass transfer and
sdB stars are produced from RGs with degenerate cores via common envelope (CE)
ejection. They are important for the studies of CE evolution, binary evolution,
and binary population synthesis. However, the relation between WD mass and
orbital period of sdB + He WD binaries has not been specifically studied. In
this paper, we first use a semi-analytic method to follow their formation and
find a WD mass and orbital period relation. Then we use a detailed stellar
evolution code to model their formation from main-sequence binaries. We find a
similar relation between the WD mass and orbital period, which is in broad
agreement with observations. For most sdB + He WD systems, if the WD mass
(orbital period) can be determined, the orbital period (WD mass) can be
inferred with this relation and then the inclination angle can be constrained
with the binary mass function. In addition, we can also use this relation to
constrain the CE ejection efficiency and find that a relative large CE ejection
efficiency is favoured. If both the WD and sdB star masses can be determined,
the critical mass ratios of dynamically unstable mass transfer for RG binaries
can also be constrained.

coupled to quantum contextuality: emotional observables determine contexts.
Such contextualization reduces degeneration of unconscious states. The

short-range repulsive interaction. The collision reduces the average accessible
physical space for a single molecule and this has a direct consequence on the
entropy of the gas. The accessibility of a molecule to a spatial coordinate (x,
y, z) inside the system depends on the local molecular density. By considering
mechanical equilibrium between a system and a reservoir, the probability of the
system in state i with volume vi is shown to be proportional to exp(-vi/v0)
where v0 is the average volume per molecule. Incorporating this factor into the
single particle partition function automatically leads to an N-particle entropy
that is extensive without applying the N! correction factor. The exp(-vi/v0)
factor plays a similar role in describing the volume distribution as the
Boltzmann factor which governs the energy distribution.

acceleration mechanisms in extreme environments, such as black holes and
relativistic jets, neutron stars, supernovae or clusters of galaxies. In the
presence of magnetic fields, particles can be accelerated towards relativistic
energies. As a consequence, radiation along the entire electromagnetic spectrum
can be observed, and extreme environments are also the most likely sources of
multi-messenger emission. The most energetic part of the electromagnetic
spectrum corresponds to the very-high-energy (VHE, E>100 GeV) gamma-ray regime,
which can be extensively studied with ground based Imaging Atmospheric
Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). The results obtained by the current generation of
IACTs, such as H.E.S.S., MAGIC, and VERITAS, demonstrate the crucial importance
of the VHE band in understanding the non-thermal emission of extreme
environments in our Universe. In some objects, the energy output in gamma rays
can even outshine the rest of the broadband spectrum. The Cherenkov Telescope
Array (CTA) is the next generation of IACTs, which, with cutting edge
technology and a strategic configuration of ~100 telescopes distributed in two
observing sites, in the northern and southern hemispheres, will reach better
sensitivity, angular and energy resolution, and broader energy coverage than
currently operational IACTs. With CTA we can probe the most extreme
environments and considerably boost our knowledge of the non-thermal Universe.

  Biomedical Literature",,,,,"cs.IR stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Since the emergence of the worldwide pandemic of COVID-19, relevant research
has been published at a dazzling pace, which yields an abundant amount of big
data in biomedical literature. Due to the high volum of relevant literature, it
is practically impossible to follow up the research manually. Topic modeling is
a well-known unsupervised learning that aims to reveal latent topics from text
data. In this paper, we propose a novel analytical framework for estimating
topic interactions and effective visualization to improve topics'
relationships. We first estimate topic-word distributions using the biterm
topic model and estimate the topics' interaction based on the word distribution
using the latent space item response model. We mapped these latent topics onto
networks to visualize relationships among the topics. Moreover, in the proposed
approach, we developed a score that is helpful in selecting meaningful words
that characterize the topic. We figure out how topics are related by looking at
how their relationships change. We do this with a ""trajectory plot"" that is
made with different levels of word richness. These findings provide a
thoroughly mined and intuitive representation of relationships between topics
related to a specific research area. The application of this proposed framework
to the PubMed literature demonstrates utility of our approach in understanding
of the topic composition related to COVID-19 studies in the stage of its
emergence.

electricity consumption to energy usages of individual appliances, thus greatly
cutting down the cost in fine-grained household load monitoring. To address the
arisen privacy concern in NILM applications, federated learning (FL) could be
leveraged for NILM model training and sharing. When applying the FL paradigm in

  In this paper we present FedNILM, a practical FL paradigm for NILM
applications at the edge client. Specifically, FedNILM is designed to deliver
privacy-preserving and personalized NILM services to large-scale edge clients,
by leveraging i) secure data aggregation through federated learning, ii)
efficient cloud model compression via filter pruning and multi-task learning,
and iii) personalized edge model building with unsupervised transfer learning.
Our experiments on real-world energy data show that, FedNILM is able to achieve
personalized energy disaggregation with the state-of-the-art accuracy, while

explore in what ways the spread of the disease could be mitigated. One of the
models that have been used a great deal is the
Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model. Some researchers have

to the best of our knowledge, the state-of-the-art papers have not considered
the effect of different vaccine types, meaning single shot and double shot
vaccines, in their SEIR model. In this paper, we propose a modified version of
the SEIR model which takes into account the effect of different vaccine types.
We compare how different policies for the administration of the vaccine can
influence the rate at which people are exposed to the disease, get infected,
recover, and pass away. Our results suggest that taking the double shot vaccine
such as Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna does a better job at mitigating the spread
and fatality rate of the disease compared to the single shot vaccine, due to
its higher efficacy.

utilize a dictionary learning model to extract functional networks from the ASD
group and rank the top 20 ROIs. Third, we merged the 40 selected ROIs from the

corresponding masks based on the 20 selected ROIs from group ICA, the 20 ROIs
selected from dictionary learning, and the 40 combined ROIs selected from both.
Finally, we extract ROIs for all training samples using the above three masks,

retired EV batteries, which are typically recycled despite having nearly 80%

energy storage systems (2-BESS) has both economical and environmental benefits.
The challenge with second-use batteries is the heterogeneity in their state of
health. This paper introduces a new strategy to optimize 2-BESS performance
despite the heterogeneity of individual batteries while reducing the cost of
power conversion. In this paper, the statistical distribution of the power
heterogeneity in the supply of batteries is used to optimize the choice of
power converters and design the power flow within the battery energy storage
system (BESS) to optimize power capability. By leveraging a new lite-sparse
hierarchical partial power processing (LS-HiPPP) approach, we study how a
hierarchy in partial power processing (PPP) partitions power converters to
significantly reduce converter ratings, process less power to achieve high
system efficiency with lower cost (lower efficiency) converters, and take
advantage of economies of scale by requiring only a minimal number of sets of
identical converters. Our results demonstrate that LS-HiPPP architectures offer
the best tradeoff between battery utilization and converter cost and have
higher system efficiency than conventional partial power processing (C-PPP) in
all cases.

output as total or size-specific particle counts and mass concentrations. These
quantities are not measured directly but are estimated by the original
equipment manufacturers' (OEM) proprietary algorithms and have inherent
limitations since particle scattering depends on their composition, size,
shape, and complex index of refraction (CRI). Hence, there is a need to
characterize and calibrate their performance under a controlled environment. We
present calibration algorithms for Plantower PMS A003 sensor as a function of
particle size and concentration. A standardized experimental protocol was used
to control the PM level, environmental conditions and to evaluate
sensor-to-sensor reproducibility. The calibration was based on tests when PMS
A003 were exposed to different polydisperse standardized testing aerosols. The
results suggested particle size distribution from PMS A003 was shifted compared
to reference instrument measures. For calibration of number concentration,
linear model without adjusting aerosol properties corrects the raw PMS A003
measurement for specific size bins with normalized mean absolute error within
4.0% of the reference instrument. Although the Bayesian Information Criterion
suggests that models adjusting for particle optical properties and relative
humidity are technically superior, they should be used with caution as the
particle properties used in fitting were within a narrow range for challenge
aerosols. The calibration models adjusted for particle CRI and density account
for non-linearity in the OEM's mass concentrations estimates and demonstrated
lower error. These results have significant implications for using PMS A003 in
high concentration environments, including indoor air quality and
occupational/industrial exposure assessments, wildfire smoke, or near-source
monitoring scenarios.

latent variables at each stage into two types: a global variable capturing the
common semantic features and a specific variable absorbing the attribute
information at that stage. PHED then couples the CVAE latent variables with the
Transformer encoder and is trained by minimizing a newly derived ELBO and
controlled losses to produce the next stage's input and produce responses as
required. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations to show that PHED
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art neural generation models and
produces more diverse responses as expected.
