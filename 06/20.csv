around the world. From children to older people, technology is present, helping
in the most diverse daily tasks and allowing accessibility. However, many times
these people are just end-users, without any incentive to the development of
computational thinking (CT). With advances in technologies, the abstraction of
coding, programming languages, and the hardware resources involved will become
a reality. However, while we have not progressed to this stage, it is necessary
to encourage the development of CT teaching from an early age. This work will
present state of the art concerning teaching initiatives and tools on
programming (e.g., ScratchJr), robotics (e.g., KIBO), and other playful tools
(e.g., Happy Maps) for the development of CT in the early ages, specifically
filling the gap of CT at the kindergarten level. This survey presents a
systematic review of the literature, emphasizing computational and robotic
tools used in preschool classes to develop the CT. The systematic review
evaluated more than 60 papers from 2010 to December 2020, electing 31 papers
and adding three papers from the qualitative stage. The paper's amount was
classified in taxonomy to show CT's principal tools and initiates applied to
children early. To conclude this survey, an extensive discussion about the
terms and authors related to this research area is present.

learns from spatio-temporal latent scores and predicts actions for keeping or
rejecting a video frame in a video summary. We investigate if real/inflated 3D
spatio-temporal CNN features are better suited to learn representations from
videos than commonly used 2D image features. Our framework can operate in both,
a fully unsupervised mode and a supervised training mode. We analyse the impact
of prescribed summary lengths and show experimental evidence for the
effectiveness of 3DST-UNet-RL on two commonly used general video summarization
benchmarks. We also applied our method on a medical video summarization task.
The proposed video summarization method has the potential to save storage costs

subwavelength imaging, many researchers devoted themselves to investigating
this methodology. However, due to the free propagating feature of the
traditional structured illumination fields, the resolution can be only improved
up to double times compared with the diffractied limited microscopy. Besides,
most of the previous studies, relying on incoherent illumination sources, are
restricted to fluorescent samples. In this work, a subwavelength nonfluorescent
imaging method is proposed based on the terahertz traveling wave and plasmonics
illumination. Excited along with a metal grating, the spoof surface plasmons
are employed as the plasmonics illumination. When the scattering waves with the
SSPs illumination are captured, the high order spatial frequency components of
the sample are already encoded into the obtainable low order ones. Then, an
algorithm is summarized to shift the modulated SF components to their actual
positions in the Fourier domain. In this manner, high order SF components
carrying the fine information are introduced to reconstruct the desired
imaging, leading to an improvement of the resolution up to 0.12 lambda.
Encouragingly, the resolution can be further enhanced by tuning the working
frequency of the SSPs. This method holds promise for some important
applications in terahertz nonfluorescent microscopy and sample detection with
weak scattering.

crucial as understanding both healthy and pathological RPE cell physiology is
for those diseases, no current technique allows subcellular in vivo or in vitro
live observation of this critical cell layer. To fill this gap, we propose
dynamic full-field OCT (D-FFOCT) as a candidate for live observation of in
vitro RPE phenotype. In this way, we monitored primary porcine and human stem
cell-derived RPE cells in stress model conditions by performing scratch assays.
In this study, we quantified wound healing parameters on the stressed RPE, and
observed different cell phenotypes, displayed by the D-FFOCT signal. In order
to decipher the subcellular contributions to these dynamic profiles, we
performed immunohistochemistry to identify which organelles generate the signal
and found mitochondria to be the main contributor to D-FFOCT contrast.
Altogether, D-FFOCT appears to be an innovative method to follow degenerative
disease evolution and could be an appreciated method in the future for live
patient diagnostics and to direct treatment choice.

under very severe data limitations. Specifically, the algorithm has access to
streaming and noisy data only from a single and ongoing trial. It accomplishes
such performance by effectively leveraging various forms of side information on
the dynamics to reduce the sample complexity. Such side information typically
comes from elementary laws of physics and qualitative properties of the system.
More precisely, the algorithm approximately solves an optimal control problem
encoding the system's desired behavior. To this end, it constructs and
iteratively refines a data-driven differential inclusion that contains the
unknown vector field of the dynamics. The differential inclusion, used in an
interval Taylor-based method, enables to over-approximate the set of states the
system may reach. Theoretically, we establish a bound on the suboptimality of
the approximate solution with respect to the optimal control with known
dynamics. We show that the longer the trial or the more side information is
available, the tighter the bound. Empirically, experiments in a high-fidelity
F-16 aircraft simulator and MuJoCo's environments illustrate that, despite the
scarcity of data, the algorithm can provide performance comparable to
reinforcement learning algorithms trained over millions of environment
interactions. Besides, we show that the algorithm outperforms existing
techniques combining system identification and model predictive control.

chromosphere and corona. We put the lower boundary of our simulation region in
the low chromosphere, where ions and neutrals begin to decouple, and implement
there a monochromatic driver that directly generates Alfv\'en waves with a wave
period of 30 s. As the ion-neutral drift increases with height, the two-fluid
effects become more significant and the energy carried by both Alfv\'en and
magneto-acoustic waves can be thermalized in the process of ion-neutral
collisions there. In fact, we observe a significant increase in plasma
temperature along the magnetic flux-tube. In conclusion, the two-fluid
torsional Alfv\'en waves can potentially play a role in the heating of the
solar chromosphere.

all convective stars harbor. Yet, more than 99% of its visible surface along
the solar cycle (the so-called quiet Sun) is filled with a tangled, unresolved
magnetism. These ""hidden"" fields are thought to store enough magnetic energy to
play a role in the heating of the Sun's outer atmosphere, but its field
strength is still not constrained. Previous investigations based on the Hanle
effect in atomic lines claim a strong magnetization of about 100 G, while the
same effect in molecules show a factor of 10 weaker fields. The discrepancy
disappears if the magnetic field strength of the hidden is not homogeneous in
the solar surface. In this letter, we prove using magnetohydrodynamical
simulations that it is possible to infer the average field strength of the
hidden quiet Sun magnetic fields using multi-line inversions of intensity
profiles in the Zeeman regime. Using this technique with 15 spectral lines in
the 1.5 $\mu$m spectral range, we reveal that the spatial distribution of the
hidden field is strongly correlated with convection motions, and that the
average magnetization is about 46 G. Reconciling our findings with the Hanle
ones is not obvious and will require future work on both sides, since it
implies an increase of the field strength with height, something that is
physically questionable.

engineered features are based upon matching the input information against
income records extracted automatically from various publicly available online
sources (e.g. payscale.com, H-1B filings, government employee salaries). We
conduct experiments on two data sets, one simulated from H-1B records and the
other from a real-world data set of peer-to-peer (P2P) loan applications
obtained from one of the world's largest P2P lending platform. Our results show
a significant reduction in error of 3-6% relative to several strong baselines.
We also perform ablation studies to demonstrate that a combined model is indeed
necessary to achieve state-of-the-art performance on this task.

Bayle, Babak and Petiteau \cite{Vallisneri2020} by applying their data

Bayle, Babak and Petiteau \cite{Vallisneri2020} {\underbar {do}} depend on the
boundary-conditions selected for the two-way Doppler data. We prove this by
adopting the (non-physical) boundary conditions used by Vallisneri {\it et al.}
and deriving the corresponding analytic expression for a laser-noise-canceling
combination. We show it to be characterized by a number of Doppler measurement
terms that grows with the observation time and works for any time-dependent

two-way light times are equal to twice and three-times the sampling time, the
solutions identified by TDI-$\infty$ are linear combinations of the TDI

case studies, preventing a comprehensive understanding of CME complexity

CMEs interacting with different solar wind streams using the linear force-free
spheromak CME model incorporated into the EUropean Heliospheric FORecasting

investigation of the evolution of CME complexity using a swarm of radially

conditions, and to what extent, CMEs exhibit variations of their magnetic
structure and complexity during propagation, as measured by spacecraft that are
radially aligned. Results indicate that the interaction with large-scale solar

probability to detect an increase of the CME magnetic complexity between two
spacecraft in radial alignment, compared to cases without such interactions.
This work represents the first attempt to quantify the probability of detecting

qubit either to a sweet spot, where it is relatively insensitive to charge
noise, or to a point where it is resonant with the microwave cavity.
Unfortunately, such operating points seldom coincide. Here, we theoretically
investigate several schemes for performing gates between two quantum-dot hybrid

hybrid qubit gives rise to two types of sweet spots, which can occur at
operating points with strong charge dipole moments. Such strong interactions
provide new opportunities for off-resonant gating, thereby removing one of the
main obstacles for long-distance two-qubit gates. Our results suggest that the
numerous tuning knobs of quantum dot hybrid qubits make them good candidates
for strong coupling. In particular, we show that off-resonant
red-sideband-mediated two-qubit gates can exhibit fidelities $>$95\% for
realistic operating parameters, and we describe improvements that could
potentially yield gate fidelities $>$99\%.

Material functionality depends strongly on the nature and organization of
defects, their arrangements often involve intermediate or transient states that
present a high barrier for transformation. The lack of knowledge of these
intermediate states and the presence of this energy barrier presents a serious
challenge for inverse defect design, especially for gradient-based approaches.
Here, we present a reinforcement learning (Monte Carlo Tree Search) based on
delayed rewards that allow for efficient search of the defect configurational
space and allows us to identify optimal defect arrangements in low dimensional
materials. Using a representative case of 2D MoS2, we demonstrate that the use
of delayed rewards allows us to efficiently sample the defect configurational
space and overcome the energy barrier for a wide range of defect concentrations
(from 1.5% to 8% S vacancies), the system evolves from an initial randomly
distributed S vacancies to one with extended S line defects consistent with
previous experimental studies. Detailed analysis in the feature space allows us
to identify the optimal pathways for this defect transformation and
arrangement. Comparison with other global optimization schemes like genetic
algorithms suggests that the MCTS with delayed rewards takes fewer evaluations
and arrives at a better quality of the solution. The implications of the
various sampled defect configurations on the 2H to 1T phase transitions in MoS2

experimentally demonstrate that it can be reduced by the parallel tempering
method. In particular, we demonstrate that RGN can be made robust to energy
spikes that occur when the sampler moves between metastable regions of

searching for the shortest path(s) between their nest and a source of food. In
this model, the nest and the source of food are two distinguished nodes $N$ and
$F$ in a finite graph $\mathcal G$. The ants perform a sequence of random walks
on this graph, starting from the nest and stopped when first hitting the source
of food. At each step of its random walk, the $n$-th ant chooses to cross a
neighbouring edge with probability proportional to the number of preceding ants
that crossed that edge at least once. We say that {\it the ants find the
shortest path} if, almost surely as the number of ants grow to infinity, almost
all the ants go from the nest to the source of food through one of the shortest
paths, without loosing time on other edges of the graph.
  Our contribution is three-fold: (1) We prove that, if $\mathcal G$ is a tree
rooted at $N$ whose leaves have been merged into node $F$, and with one edge
between $N$ and $F$, then the ants indeed find the shortest path. (2) In
contrast, we provide three examples of graphs on which the ants do not find the
shortest path, suggesting that in this model and in most graphs, ants do not
find the shortest path. (3) In all these cases, we show that the sequence of
normalised edge-weights converge to a {\it deterministic} limit, despite a
linear-reinforcement mechanism, and we conjecture that this is a general fact
which is valid on all finite graphs. To prove these results, we use stochastic
approximation methods, and in particular the ODE method. One difficulty comes
from the fact that this method relies on understanding the behaviour at large

evaluated via a series of simulations and is over 99% accurate at high
eye-tracking speeds of over 1,000Hz. iTrace and gazel completely revolutionize
the way eye tracking studies are conducted in realistic settings with the

symmetric and an anti-symmetric subtensors which are called the strain-rate and
vorticity tensors. There are two problems with Cauchy-Stokes decomposition. The
first one is that the anti-symmetric or vorticity tensor cannot represent the
fluid rotation or vortex. The second one is that the symmetric (strain-rate)
tensor cannot distinguish the stretching (compression) and shear. The
stretching and shear are dependent on the coordinate or are not Galilean
invariant. Since vorticity cannot distinguish between the non-rotational shear
and the rigid rotation, vorticity has been decomposed to a rigid rotation
called Liutex and anti-symmetric shear in our previous work. A Liutex-based
principal coordinate was developed and the velocity gradient tensor was
decomposed in the principal coordinate as a rigid rotation (Liutex tensor), a
pure shear tensor and a stretching (compression) tensor, which is called the
principal decomposition. However, the principal decomposition is made at each
point which has own principal coordinate different from other points. This
paper derives the principal decomposition in the original xyz coordinate
system, and, therefore, provides a new tool for fluid kinematics to conduct the
velocity gradient tensor decomposition to rigid rotation, pure shear, and
stretching (compression) which is Galilean invariant and has clear physical
meanings. The new velocity gradient tensor decomposition could become a
foundation for new fluid kinematics.

The APE method treats the environment nature as an adversarial agent and learns
towards, through adaptive importance sampling, the zero-variance sampling

discrete or continuous spaces by incorporating function approximators. We
investigate the convergence property of APE in the tabular setting. Our
empirical studies show that APE can estimate the rare event probability with a
smaller bias while only using orders of magnitude fewer samples than baselines

compared to other babies, and the proportion of babies with a low birthweight
is a common metric used when evaluating public health in a population. While
many factors increase the risk of a baby having a low birthweight, many can be
linked to the mother's socioeconomic status, which in turn contributes to large
racial disparities in the incidence of low weight births. Here, we employ
Bayesian statistical models to analyze the proportion of babies with low
birthweight in Pennsylvania counties by race/ethnicity. Due to the small number
of births -- and low weight births -- in many Pennsylvania counties when
stratified by race/ethnicity, our methods must walk a fine line. On one hand,
leveraging spatial structure can help improve the precision of our estimates.
On the other hand, we must be cautious to avoid letting the model overwhelm the
information in the data and produce spurious conclusions. As such, we first
develop a framework by which we can measure (and control) the informativeness
of our spatial model. After demonstrating the properties of our framework via
simulation, we analyze the low birthweight data from Pennsylvania and examine
the extent to which the commonly used conditional autoregressive model can lead
to oversmoothing. We then reanalyze the data using our proposed framework and

constraints on a parameter not directly restricted by solar system tests. Using
current data sets available for white dwarfs and strange quark stars candidates
we find that the most stringent bounds come from the objects displaying the
highest core densities, namely strange quark stars. Specifically, the
constraints obtained from this class of stars are three to four orders of

with a functional predictor, called the Sparse Functional Logistic Regression
(SFLR), where the corresponding coefficient function is {\it locally sparse},
that is, it is completely zero on some subregions of its domain. The
coefficient function, together with the intercept parameter, are estimated
through a doubly-penalized likelihood approach with a B-splines expansion. One
penalty is for controlling the roughness of the coefficient function estimate
and the other penalty, in the form of the $L_1$ norm, enforces the local
sparsity. A Newton-Raphson procedure is designed for the optimization of the
penalized likelihood. Our simulations show that SFLR is capable of generating a
smooth and reasonably good estimate of the coefficient function on the non-null
region(s) while recognizing the null region(s). Application of the method to
the Raman spectral data generated from the heomdialysis study pinpoint the

At each node in the hierarchy, a small DNN identifies a different attribute of

explicitly capture the underlying distribution of appropriate reduced-dimension
representations of the input data. The idea is to jointly design a nonlinear
dimensionality reducing auto-encoder to model the training data in terms of a
parsimonious set of latent random variables, and learn a canonical low-rank
tensor model of the joint distribution of the latent variables in the Fourier
domain. The proposed latent density model is non-parametric and universal, as
opposed to the predefined prior that is assumed in variational auto-encoders.
Joint optimization of the auto-encoder and the latent density estimator is
pursued via a formulation which learns both by minimizing a combination of the
negative log-likelihood in the latent domain and the auto-encoder
reconstruction loss. We demonstrate that the proposed model achieves very
promising results on toy, tabular, and image datasets on regression tasks,
sampling, and anomaly detection.

contributions from local seeing, both``mirror'' and ``dome'', which arise from
turbulence and temperature variations that are difficult to quantify, measure
directly, and ameliorate. We describe a method to determine the ``local''
seeing degradation due to wavefront perturbations within the final tens of
meters of the optical path from celestial sources to a ground-based telescope,
using the primary instrument and along the same path taken by light from
celestial sources. The concept involves placing strobed emitters along the
light path to produce images on the main focal plane that ``freeze'' different
realizations of index perturbations. This method has the advantage of measuring
directly the image motion and scintillation imparted by the dynamic spatial and
temporal structure of local perturbations in the index of refraction along the
light path, with a clean separation from seeing induced in the atmosphere above
the dome. The strobed-source approach allows for rapid image motion and
scintillation to be measured directly on the focal plane, even for
large-aperture telescopes with wide field instruments and slow shutters, such
as that being constructed for the Rubin Observatory. A conceptual design is
presented that uses the ``guider'' CCDs in the Rubin telescope focal plane to
make local-seeing measurements on demand, perhaps even during science

observing that periodicity may break down at the ensemble average level, even

provide new insights towards a complete description of PD-QTMs, from turn-on to

ferroelectric Rashba effect (FRE). Although the FER has been widely observed
for bulk ferroelectric systems, its existence in two-dimensional (2D)
ferroelectric systems is still very rarely discovered. Based on
first-principles calculations, supplemented with $\vec{k}\cdot\vec{p}$
analysis, we report the emergence of the FRE in the Ga$XY$ ($X$= Se, Te; $Y$=
Cl, Br, I) monolayer compounds, a new class of 2D materials having in-plane
ferroelectricity. Due to the large in-plane ferroelectric polarization, a giant
out-of-plane Rashba effect is observed in the topmost valence band, producing
unidirectional out-of-plane spin textures in the momentum space. Importantly,
such out-of-plane spin textures, which can host a long-lived helical spin mode
known as a persistent spin helix, can be fully reversed by switching the
direction of the in-plane ferroelectric polarization. Thus, our findings can
open avenues for interplay between the unidirectional out-of-plane Rashba
effect and the in-plane ferroelectricity in 2D materials, which is useful for

Direct observation of the 2D Wigner crystal lattice in real space, however, has

conventional STM measurements can potentially alter fragile Wigner crystal

the ReGO designs an Adaptive Content Selection (ACS) module to transfer the
pixel of reference images for texture compensating of the target one. To
prevent the style of the generated part from being affected by the reference

synthesize style-consistent results. Extensive experiments on two popular

Unlike traditional cloud-based control that treats the cloud as powerful,

performance. In particular, we formalize the fusion problem for finite-duration
tasks by explicitly considering model mismatches and errors due to
request-response communication delays. We analyze stability-like properties of
the proposed cloud-assisted MPC framework and establish approaches to robustly
handling constraints within this framework in spite of plant-model mismatch and

while satisfying stability-like conditions, the efficacy of which is
demonstrated with multiple simulation examples, including an automotive control

labeled samples, which is difficult to obtain in the field of remote sensing.
Self-supervised learning (SSL), can be used to solve such problems by
pre-training a general model with a large number of unlabeled images and then
fine-tuning it on a downstream task with very few labeled samples. Contrastive
learning is a typical method of SSL that can learn general invariant features.
However, most existing contrastive learning methods are designed for
classification tasks to obtain an image-level representation, which may be
suboptimal for semantic segmentation tasks requiring pixel-level
discrimination. Therefore, we propose a global style and local matching
contrastive learning network (GLCNet) for remote sensing image semantic
segmentation. Specifically, 1) the global style contrastive learning module is
used to better learn an image-level representation, as we consider that style
features can better represent the overall image features. 2) The local features
matching contrastive learning module is designed to learn representations of
local regions, which is beneficial for semantic segmentation. The experimental
results show that our method mostly outperforms SOTA self-supervised methods
and the ImageNet pre-training method. Specifically, with 1\% annotation from
the original dataset, our approach improves Kappa by 6\% on the ISPRS Potsdam
dataset relative to the existing baseline. Moreover, our method outperforms
supervised learning methods when there are some differences between the
datasets of upstream tasks and downstream tasks. Since SSL could directly learn
the essential characteristics of data from unlabeled data, which is easy to
obtain in the remote sensing field, this may be of great significance for tasks
such as global mapping. The source code is available at

Although these signals are carefully crafted, they still appear noise-like
patterns to humans. This observation has led to the argument that deep visual
representation is misaligned with human perception. We counter-argue by
providing evidence of human-meaningful patterns in adversarial perturbations.
We first propose an attack that fools a network to confuse a whole category of
objects (source class) with a target label. Our attack also limits the
unintended fooling by samples from non-sources classes, thereby circumscribing
human-defined semantic notions for network fooling. We show that the proposed
attack not only leads to the emergence of regular geometric patterns in the
perturbations, but also reveals insightful information about the decision
boundaries of deep models. Exploring this phenomenon further, we alter the
`adversarial' objective of our attack to use it as a tool to `explain' deep
visual representation. We show that by careful channeling and projection of the
perturbations computed by our method, we can visualize a model's understanding
of human-defined semantic notions. Finally, we exploit the explanability
properties of our perturbations to perform image generation, inpainting and
interactive image manipulation by attacking adversarialy robust
`classifiers'.In all, our major contribution is a novel pragmatic adversarial
attack that is subsequently transformed into a tool to interpret the visual

However, challenges such as Fermi-level pinning at the metal contact-TMD

most TMD solar cells from exceeding 2% power conversion efficiency (PCE). In
addition, fabrication on flexible substrates tends to contaminate or damage TMD

epidemic process for generating ground-truth data. However, this assumed data
generation process can be unrealistic, since data sources for epidemics are
often aggregated across geographic regions and communities. As a result,
state-of-the-art models for estimating epidemiological parameters,
e.g.~transmission rates, can be inappropriate when faced with complex systems.
Our work empirically demonstrates some limitations of applying epidemiological
models to aggregated datasets. We generate three complex outbreak scenarios by
combining incidence curves from multiple epidemics that are independently
simulated via SEIR models with different sets of parameters. Using these
scenarios, we assess the robustness of a state-of-the-art Bayesian inference
method that estimates the epidemic trajectory from viral load surveillance
data. We evaluate two data-generating models within this Bayesian inference
framework: a simple exponential growth model and a highly flexible Gaussian
process prior model. Our results show that both models generate accurate
transmission rate estimates for the combined incidence curve at the cost of
generating biased estimates for each underlying epidemic, reflecting highly
heterogeneous underlying population dynamics. The exponential growth model,
while interpretable, is unable to capture the complexity of the underlying
epidemics. With sufficient surveillance data, the Gaussian process prior model
captures the shape of complex trajectories, but is imprecise for periods of low
data coverage. Thus, our results highlight the potential pitfalls of neglecting
complexity and heterogeneity in the data generation process, which can mask
underlying location- and population-specific epidemic dynamics.

been complemented in recent years by research efforts oriented towards

consequent growing emphasis on individuals and team relations in contemporary

primarily quantitative analysis approaches. There is concern, however, that
such approaches can provide only a partial picture of the software process.
Given the way human behavior is nuanced within psychological and social

minimizing a semantic loss as an auxiliary objective. We explore this idea on
two different sized data sets on the task of next utterance generation in goal
oriented dialogues. We make two observations (1) minimizing a semantic

only as-good-as minimizing the NLL in the larger data set (MultiWoZ) (2) large
language model embeddings can be more useful as a semantic loss objective than
as initialization for token embeddings.

analysis, such as recommendation systems and anomaly detection with graphs.
However, most of previous approaches cannot handle large graphs efficiently,
due to that (i) computation on graphs is often costly and (ii) the size of
graph or the intermediate results of vectors could be prohibitively large,
rendering it difficult to be processed on a single machine. In this paper, we
propose an efficient and effective distributed algorithm for network embedding
on large graphs using Apache Spark, which recursively partitions a graph into
several small-sized subgraphs to capture the internal and external structural
information of nodes, and then computes the network embedding for each subgraph
in parallel. Finally, by aggregating the outputs on all subgraphs, we obtain
the embeddings of nodes in a linear cost. After that, we demonstrate in various
experiments that our proposed approach is able to handle graphs with billions
of edges within a few hours and is at least 4 times faster than the
state-of-the-art approaches. Besides, it achieves up to $4.25\%$ and $4.27\%$
improvements on link prediction and node classification tasks respectively. In
the end, we deploy the proposed algorithms in two online games of Tencent with
the applications of friend recommendation and item recommendation, which
improve the competitors by up to $91.11\%$ in running time and up to $12.80\%$
in the corresponding evaluation metrics.

predicting the appropriate response, evaluation of encoder representation is a
challenging yet important problem. In this work, we showcase evaluating the
text generated through human or automatic metrics is not sufficient to
appropriately evaluate soundness of the language understanding of dialogue

representation of different language encoders commonly used in dialogue models.
From experiments, we observe that some of the probe tasks are easier and some
are harder for even sophisticated model architectures to learn. And, through
experiments we observe that RNN based architectures have lower performance on
automatic metrics on text generation than transformer model but perform better
than the transformer model on the probe tasks indicating that RNNs might
preserve task information better than the Transformers.

manifold learning from a global state representation, to a network of local
interacting manifolds termed a Generative Manifold Network (GMN). Manifolds are
discovered using the convergent cross mapping (CCM) causal inference algorithm
which are then compressed into a reduced redundancy network. The representation
is a network of manifolds embedded from observational data where each
orthogonal axis of a local manifold is an embedding of a individually
identifiable neuron or brain area that has exact correspondence in the real
world. As such these can be experimentally manipulated to test hypotheses
derived from theory and data analysis. Here we demonstrate that this
representation preserves the essential features of the brain of flies,larval
zebrafish and humans. In addition to accurate near-term prediction, the GMN
model can be used to synthesize realistic time series of whole brain neuronal
activity and locomotion viewed over the long term. Thus, as a final validation
of how well GMN captures essential dynamic information, we show that the
artificially generated time series can be used as a training set to predict
out-of-sample observed fly locomotion, as well as brain activity in out of
sample withheld data not used in model building. Remarkably, the artificially
generated time series show realistic novel behaviors that do not exist in the
training data, but that do exist in the out-of-sample observational data. This
suggests that GMN captures inherently emergent properties of the network. We
suggest our approach may be a generic recipe for mapping time series
observations of any complex nonlinear network into a model that is able to
generate naturalistic system behaviors that identifies variables that have real
world correspondence and can be experimentally manipulated.

unsolved, even in the case of $n=5$ with the help of computers.
  The purpose of this paper is to continue our study of the hit problem by
developing a result in \cite{ph31} for $\mathcal P_n$ in the generic degree
$r(2^s-1)+m.2^s$ where $r=n=5,\ m=13,$ and $s$ is an arbitrary non-negative

concatenating the channels' embeddings and (iii) recovers the complex
inter-channel relationships during channel selection, by exploiting an ensemble
of AutoEncoders (AE) to identify from these vectors the most relevant channels

and then upsample them to restore resolution for pixel-level predictions. In
such a schema, upsample technique is vital in restoring information for better
performance. However, existing upsample techniques leverage little information
from downsampling paths. The local and detailed feature from the shallower
layer such as boundary and tissue texture is particularly more important in
medical segmentation compared with natural image segmentation. To this end, we
propose a novel upsample approach for medical image segmentation, Window
Attention Upsample (WAU), which upsamples features conditioned on local and
detailed features from downsampling path in local windows by introducing
attention decoders of Transformer. WAU could serve as a general upsample method
and be incorporated into any segmentation model that possesses lateral
connections. We first propose the Attention Upsample which consists of
Attention Decoder (AD) and bilinear upsample. AD leverages pixel-level
attention to model long-range dependency and global information for a better
upsample. Bilinear upsample is introduced as the residual connection to
complement the upsampled features. Moreover, considering the extensive memory
and computation cost of pixel-level attention, we further design a window
attention scheme to restrict attention computation in local windows instead of
the global range. We evaluate our method (WAU) on classic U-Net structure with
lateral connections and achieve state-of-the-art performance on Synapse
multi-organ segmentation, Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) Brain, and
Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge (ACDC) datasets. We also validate the

elements of group 13, 14 and 15 in the 2p, 3p and 4p blocks. With increasing
principal quantum number of frontier orbitals, the lowering of self-energy
corrections(SEC) to the band-gap and consequently to the dominant inter-atomic
TB parameters, is much faster in bulk than in nano-diamonds and hence not
transferable from bulks to nano-structures. However, TB parameters transfered
from smaller nano-diamonds to much larger ones exclusively through mapping of
neighbourhoods of atoms not limited to nearest neighbours, are found to render
HOMO-LUMO gaps of the larger nano-diamonds with few hundreds of atoms in good
agreement with their explicitly computed values at the DFT as well as DFT+G0W0
levels. TB parameters and their SEC are found to vary significantly from 2p to
3p block but negligibly from 3p to 4p, while varying rather slowly within each
block, implying the possibility of transfer of SEC across block with increasing
principal quantum number. The demonstrated easy transferability of self-energy

computationally inexpensive estimation of quasi-particle electronic structure
of large finite systems with thousands of atoms.

factor, making ccRCC nuclei grading a crucial task in RCC pathology analysis.
Computer-aided nuclei grading aims to improve pathologists' work efficiency
while reducing their misdiagnosis rate by automatically identifying the grades
of tumor nuclei within histopathological images. Such a task requires precisely
segment and accurately classify the nuclei. However, most of the existing
nuclei segmentation and classification methods can not handle the inter-class
similarity property of nuclei grading, thus can not be directly applied to the
ccRCC grading task. In this paper, we propose a Composite High-Resolution
Network for ccRCC nuclei grading. Specifically, we propose a segmentation
network called W-Net that can separate the clustered nuclei. Then, we recast
the fine-grained classification of nuclei to two cross-category classification
tasks, based on two high-resolution feature extractors (HRFEs) which are
proposed for learning these two tasks. The two HRFEs share the same backbone
encoder with W-Net by a composite connection so that meaningful features for
the segmentation task can be inherited for the classification task. Last, a
head-fusion block is applied to generate the predicted label of each nucleus.
Furthermore, we introduce a dataset for ccRCC nuclei grading, containing 1000
image patches with 70945 annotated nuclei. We demonstrate that our proposed
method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods on
this large ccRCC grading dataset.

under constrained resource settings like few-shot learning. The popular
approaches for ML either learn a generalizable initial model or a generic

the knowledge from a batch of tasks to learn an optimal prior. In this work, we
study the importance of a batch for ML. Specifically, we first incorporate a
batch episodic training regimen to improve the learning of the generic
parametric optimizer. We also hypothesize that the common assumption in batch
episodic training that each task in a batch has an equal contribution to
learning an optimal meta-model need not be true. We propose to weight the tasks
in a batch according to their ""importance"" in improving the meta-model's
learning. To this end, we introduce a training curriculum motivated by
selective focus in humans, called task attended meta-training, to weight the
tasks in a batch. Task attention is a standalone module that can be integrated
with any batch episodic training regimen. The comparisons of the models with
their non-task-attended counterparts on complex datasets like miniImageNet and

method systematically performs multi-scale accumulation and fusion of the

perception of visually similar objects, our high-resolution mapping offers
multiple novel insights into the black-box deep visual models, which are

to speaker diarization, EEND methods are better in terms of speaker overlap
handling. However, EEND still has a disadvantage in that it cannot deal with a
flexible number of speakers. To remedy this problem, we introduce
encoder-decoder-based attractor calculation module (EDA) to EEND. Once
frame-wise embeddings are obtained, EDA sequentially generates speaker-wise
attractors on the basis of a sequence-to-sequence method using an LSTM
encoder-decoder. The attractor generation continues until a stopping condition
is satisfied; thus, the number of attractors can be flexible. Diarization
results are then estimated as dot products of the attractors and embeddings.
The embeddings from speaker overlaps result in larger dot product values with
multiple attractors; thus, this method can deal with speaker overlaps. Because
the maximum number of output speakers is still limited by the training set, we
also propose an iterative inference method to remove this restriction. Further,
we propose a method that aligns the estimated diarization results with the
results of an external speech activity detector, which enables fair comparison

disrupt the primary functions of WSNs. This paper investigates the hole
detection and healing problems in hybrid WSNs with non-identical sensor sensing
ranges. In particular, we aim to propose centralized algorithms for detecting
holes in a given region and maximizing the area covered by a WSN in the
presence of environmental obstacles. To precisely identify the boundary of the
holes, we use an additively weighted Voronoi diagram and a polynomial-time
algorithm.Furthermore, since this problem is known to be computationally
difficult, we propose a centralized greedy 1/2-approximation algorithm to
maximize the area covered by sensors. Finally, we implement the algorithms and
run simulations to show that our approximation algorithm efficiently covers the

addition, although approaches to address the problem for discrete-time models
have been developed, no method has been successfully implemented for the
continuous-time case. We focus on reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo
which allows the trans-dimensional move among different numbers of states in
order to perform Bayesian inference for the unknown number of states.
Specifically, we propose an efficient split-combine move which can facilitate
the exploration of the parameter space, and demonstrate that it can be
implemented effectively at scale. Subsequently, we extend this algorithm to the
context of model-based clustering, allowing numbers of states and clusters both
determined during the analysis. The model formulation, inference methodology,

apply this method to real data from a Canadian healthcare system in Quebec.

characterized by their macroscopically degenerate eigenstates: compact
localized states (CLSs) in real space and Bloch states in reciprocal space.
Based on this property, this work presents a straightforward method to build
flat-band tight-binding models with short-range hoppings \emph{on any periodic
lattice}. The method consists in starting from a CLS and engineering families
of Bloch Hamiltonians as quadratic (or linear) functions of the associated
Bloch state. The resulting tight-binding models not only exhibit a flat band,
but also multifold quadratic (or linear) band touching points (BTPs) whose
number, location, and degeneracy can be controlled to a large extent. Quadratic
flat-band models are ubiquitous: they can be built from any arbitrary CLS, on
any lattice, in any dimension and with any number $N\geq2$ of bands. Linear
flat-band models are rarer: they require $N\geq3$ and can only be built from
CLSs that fulfill certain compatibility relations with the underlying lattice.
Most flat-band models from the literature can be classified according to this
scheme: Mielke's and Tasaki's models belong to the quadratic class, while the
Lieb, dice and breathing Kagome models belong to the linear class. Many novel
flat-band models are introduced, among which an $N=4$ bilayer honeycomb model
with fourfold quadratic BTPs, an $N=5$ dice model with fivefold linear BTPs,
and an $N=3$ Kagome model with BTPs that can be smoothly tuned from linear to
quadratic.

Sanger's algorithm for principal component analysis (PCA) corresponds to the

variant of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for parameter estimation
from noisy and faulty measurements in a sensor network can be written as the
iteration of an LC map that is the average of local maps, each available at
just one node. Consequently, via the DBPI, we derive two distributed algorithms
- distributed EM and distributed PCA - whose LLC guarantees follow from those
that we proved for the DBPI. The verification of the LC condition for EM is
challenging, as the underlying operator depends on random samples, thus the LC

daily basis, the issue of data privacy arises. This leads to the study of the
design of privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms. Given two objectives,
namely, utility maximization and privacy-loss minimization, this work is based
on two previously non-intersecting regimes -- Compressive Privacy and
multi-kernel method. Compressive Privacy is a privacy framework that employs
utility-preserving lossy-encoding scheme to protect the privacy of the data,
while multi-kernel method is a kernel based machine learning regime that
explores the idea of using multiple kernels for building better predictors. The
compressive multi-kernel method proposed consists of two stages -- the
compression stage and the multi-kernel stage. The compression stage follows the
Compressive Privacy paradigm to provide the desired privacy protection. Each
kernel matrix is compressed with a lossy projection matrix derived from the
Discriminant Component Analysis (DCA). The multi-kernel stage uses the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) score of each kernel to non-uniformly combine
multiple compressive kernels. The proposed method is evaluated on two
mobile-sensing datasets -- MHEALTH and HAR -- where activity recognition is
defined as utility and person identification is defined as privacy. The results
show that the compression regime is successful in privacy preservation as the
privacy classification accuracies are almost at the random-guess level in all
experiments. On the other hand, the novel SNR-based multi-kernel shows utility
classification accuracy improvement upon the state-of-the-art in both datasets.
These results indicate a promising direction for research in privacy-preserving
machine learning.

that allows real-time tracking and localisation of the tumour lesion during

to assist the radiologist in targeting MR-detected suspicious tumours. The
approach benefits from image fusion of preoperative images with intraoperative
optical tracking of markers attached to the patient's skin. A hand-mounted
biopsy device has been constructed with an actuated needle base to drive the
tip toward the desired direction. The steering commands may be provided both by
user input and by computer guidance. The workflow is validated through phantom

first principles DFT+U calculations with the aid of ab initio molecular
dynamics calculations that DMAMnF shows temperature and pressure driven spin
transitions, from a low spin $S=1/2$ to a high spin $S=5/2$ state. This
transition is accompanied by a hysteresis, and we find that this hysteresis and
the transition temperature are quite close to room temperature, which is
desirable for device applications particularly in memory, display, and
switching devices. The operating pressure is a few GPa, which is accessible in
standard laboratory settings. We find that the cooperative behaviour showing up
as hysteresis accompanying the transition is driven primarily by elastic
interactions, assisted by magnetic superexchange between Mn atoms. Last but not

reports the individuals' inclination towards other population groups. The OBI
index, calculated using both III and ISI index, is non-simplified and not only
recognizes individuals' connectivity behaviour but group's connectivity

optical to the far infrared, compiled by the HELP project and apply spectral
energy distribution (SED) fitting, using the X-CIGALE code. We exclude
quiescent sources from both the X-ray and the reference samples. We also
account for the mass completeness of our dataset, in different redshifts bins.
Our analysis highlights the importance of studying the SFR-L$_X$ relation, in a
uniform manner, taking into account the systematics and selection effects. Our
results suggest that, in less massive galaxies ($\rm log\,[M_*(M_\odot)] \sim
11$), AGN enhances the SFR of the host galaxy by $\sim 50\%$ compared to non
AGN systems. A flat relation is observed for the most massive galaxies.
SFR$_{norm}$ does not evolve with redshift. The results, although tentative,
are consistent with a scenario in which, in less massive systems, both AGN and
star formation (SF) are fed by cold gas, supplied by a merger event. In more
massive galaxies, the flat relation could be explained by a different SMBH
fuelling mechanism that is decoupled from the star formation of the host galaxy
(e.g. hot diffuse gas). Finally, we compare the host galaxy properties of X-ray
absorbed and unabsorbed sources. Our results show no difference which suggests
that X-ray absorption is not linked with the properties of the galaxy.

interest due to the explosion in the amount of data in online applications. A
particular attention has been paid to collaborative filtering, which is the
most widely used in applications that involve information recommendations.
Collaborative filtering (CF) uses the known preference of a group of users to
make predictions and recommendations about the unknown preferences of other
users (recommendations are made based on the past behavior of users). First
introduced in the 1990s, a wide variety of increasingly successful models have
been proposed. Due to the success of machine learning techniques in many areas,
there has been a growing emphasis on the application of such algorithms in
recommendation systems. In this article, we present an overview of the CF
approaches for recommender systems, their two main categories, and their
evaluation metrics. We focus on the application of classical Machine Learning
algorithms to CF recommender systems by presenting their evolution from their
first use-cases to advanced Machine Learning models. We attempt to provide a
comprehensive and comparative overview of CF systems (with python

deployed radiogoniometers, and a gateway gathering information from them,
permit to monitor and localise sources of electromagnetic emissions that are

are connected to the gateway through relay nodes. As a result, some degree of
fault-tolerance for the network of relay nodes is essential in order to offer a
reliable monitoring. On the other hand, deployment of relay nodes is typically
quite expensive. As a result, we have two conflicting requirements: minimise

problem of computing a deployment for relay nodes that minimises the relay node
network cost while at the same time guaranteeing proper working of the network

fully automatic results usually fail to meet the clinical use and typically

network for interactive segmentation of 3D medical images. Provided by user
guidance on an arbitrary slice, an interaction network is firstly employed to
obtain an initial 2D segmentation. The quality-aware memory network
subsequently propagates the initial segmentation estimation bidirectionally
over the entire volume. Subsequent refinement based on additional user guidance
on other slices can be incorporated in the same manner. To further facilitate
interactive segmentation, a quality assessment module is introduced to suggest
the next slice to segment based on the current segmentation quality of each
slice. The proposed network has two appealing characteristics: 1) The
memory-augmented network offers the ability to quickly encode past segmentation
information, which will be retrieved for the segmentation of other slices; 2)
The quality assessment module enables the model to directly estimate the
qualities of segmentation predictions, which allows an active learning paradigm
where users preferentially label the lowest-quality slice for multi-round
refinement. The proposed network leads to a robust interactive segmentation
engine, which can generalize well to various types of user annotations (e.g.,
scribbles, boxes). Experimental results on various medical datasets demonstrate
the superiority of our approach in comparison with existing techniques.

reconstructing objects and scenes with high fidelity from 2D image inputs.
Existing neural surface reconstruction approaches, such as DVR and IDR, require
foreground mask as supervision, easily get trapped in local minima, and
therefore struggle with the reconstruction of objects with severe
self-occlusion or thin structures. Meanwhile, recent neural methods for novel
view synthesis, such as NeRF and its variants, use volume rendering to produce
a neural scene representation with robustness of optimization, even for highly
complex objects. However, extracting high-quality surfaces from this learned
implicit representation is difficult because there are not sufficient surface
constraints in the representation. In NeuS, we propose to represent a surface
as the zero-level set of a signed distance function (SDF) and develop a new
volume rendering method to train a neural SDF representation. We observe that
the conventional volume rendering method causes inherent geometric errors (i.e.
bias) for surface reconstruction, and therefore propose a new formulation that
is free of bias in the first order of approximation, thus leading to more
accurate surface reconstruction even without the mask supervision. Experiments
on the DTU dataset and the BlendedMVS dataset show that NeuS outperforms the
state-of-the-arts in high-quality surface reconstruction, especially for
objects and scenes with complex structures and self-occlusion.

structural properties of existing structures will change with time due to
various factors, such as structural deteriorations and periodic environments.
The structural dynamic properties, such as modal frequencies and damping
ratios, cannot be considered as the same values as the initial ones, and the
deteriorations should be included when estimating the life-cycle flutter

  Classification","6 pages",,,,"eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To realize accurate texture classification, this article proposes a complex
networks (CN)-based multi-feature fusion method to recognize texture images.
Specifically, we propose two feature extractors to detect the global and local
features of texture images respectively. To capture the global features, we
first map a texture image as an undirected graph based on pixel location and
intensity, and three feature measurements are designed to further decipher the
image features, which retains the image information as much as possible. Then,
given the original band images (BI) and the generated feature images, we encode
them based on the local binary patterns (LBP). Therefore, the global feature
vector is obtained by concatenating four spatial histograms. To decipher the
local features, we jointly transfer and fine-tune the pre-trained VGGNet-16
model. Next, we fuse and connect the middle outputs of max-pooling layers (MP),
and generate the local feature vector by a global average pooling layer (GAP).
Finally, the global and local feature vectors are concatenated to form the
final feature representation of texture images. Experiment results show that
the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art statistical descriptors
and the deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) models.

invertible topological phases proposed in the recent paper by Hsin, Ji, and
Jian. The exotic phase has time reversal ($T$) symmetry, and depends on a
choice of the spacetime structure called the Wu structure. The exotic phase
cannot be captured by the classification of any bosonic or fermionic
topological phases, and thus gives a novel class of invertible topological
phases. When the $T$ symmetry defect admits a spin structure, our construction
reduces to a sort of the decorated domain wall construction, in terms of a
bosonic theory with $T$ symmetry defects decorated with a fermionic phase that
depends on a spin structure of the $T$ symmetry defect. By utilizing our path
integral, we propose a lattice construction for the exotic phase that generates
the $\mathbb{Z}_8$ classification of the (3+1)d invertible phase based on the
Wu structure. This generalizes the $\mathbb{Z}_8$ classification of the
$T$-symmetric (1+1)d topological superconductor proposed by Fidkowski and
Kitaev. On oriented spacetime, this (3+1)d invertible phase with a specific
choice of Wu structure reduces to a bosonic Crane-Yetter TQFT which has a
topological ordered state with a semion on its boundary. Moreover, we propose a
subclass of $G$-SPT phases based on the Wu structure labeled by a pair of
cohomological data in generic spacetime dimensions. This generalizes the Gu-Wen

millimeter-wave bands, hybrid analog-digital structure has been adopted in
massive MIMO transceivers. In this situation, the received signals at the

spatial covariance matrix (SCM), which is essential in MUSIC algorithm, cannot
be obtained using traditional sample average approach. Based on our previous
work, we propose a novel algorithm for SCM reconstruction in hybrid massive
MIMO systems with multiple RF chains. By switching the analog beamformers to a
group of predetermined DOAs, SCM can be reconstructed through the solutions of
a set of linear equations. In addition, based on insightful analysis on that

$N\geq3$, there exists $\frac{\varphi(N)}{2}$ CCPSs forming
$\frac{\varphi(N)}{2}$ CCSs, where $\varphi(N)$ is the Euler's totient
function. We prove that these CCSs are mutually orthogonal and their direct sum
form a $\varphi(N)$ dimensional subspace $s_N$ of $\mathbb{C}^N$. We propose
that any signal of finite length $N$ is represented as a linear combination of
elements from a special basis of $s_d$, for each divisor $d$ of $N$. This
defines a new transform named as Complex Conjugate Periodic Transform (CCPT).
Later, we compared CCPT with DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) and RPT
(Ramanujan Periodic Transform). It is shown that, using CCPT we can estimate
the period, hidden periods and frequency information of a signal. Whereas, RPT
does not provide the frequency information. For a complex valued input signal,
CCPT offers computational benefit over DFT. A CCPT dictionary based method is
proposed to extract non-divisor period information.

processing to medical diagnosis are commonly implemented using clock-based
processors, where computation speed is limited by the clock frequency and the
memory access time. Advances in photonic integrated circuits have enabled
research in photonic computation, where, despite excellent features such as
fast linear computation, no integrated photonic deep network has been
demonstrated to date due to the lack of scalable nonlinear functionality and
the loss of photonic devices, making scalability to a large number of layers
challenging. Here we report the first integrated end-to-end photonic deep
neural network (PDNN) that performs instantaneous image classification through
direct processing of optical waves. Images are formed on the input pixels and
optical waves are coupled into nanophotonic waveguides and processed as the
light propagates through layers of neurons on-chip. Each neuron generates an
optical output from input optical signals, where linear computation is
performed optically and the nonlinear activation function is realised
opto-electronically. The output of a laser coupled into the chip is uniformly
distributed among all neurons within the network providing the same per-neuron

to the complete elimination of the foot-ground collisions by the concerted
oscillatory motion of the model's parts. The model consists of two parts
connected via a universal joint. It does not rely on any geometry altering
mechanisms, massless parts or springs. Despite the model's simplicity, its
collisionless gaits feature walking with finite speed, foot clearance and
ground friction. The collisionless spectrum can be studied analytically in the
small movement limit, revealing infinitely many periodic modes. The modes
differ in the number of sagittal and coronal plane oscillations at different
stages of the walking cycle. We focus on the mode with the minimal number of
such oscillations, presenting its complete analytical solution. We then
numerically evolve it toward a general non-small movement solution. A general
collisionless mode can be tuned by adjusting a single model parameter. Some of
the presented results display a surprising degree of generality and

78$^{\circ}$C. The main focus of this work was to study the effect of tube
spacings on heat transfer coefficient (HTC) and bubbles behavior (bubble
departure diameter in particular) that were visualised with the help of a high
speed camera. Experiments were performed in a wide range of tube spacings (from
10.75 to 0.25 mm) and heat flux densities (from 3 to 70 kW/m$^2$).
  The obtained results show that, long spacings i.e., much longer than bubble
departure diameter, have no influence on HTC as well as on bubbles behavior. On
the contrary, the spacings on the order of the bubble departure diameter tend
to create slug flow in the bundle, that is very beneficial for the heat
exchange at low heat fluxes. Finally, narrow spacings that are much shorter
than the bubble departure diameter have shown the potential to enhance the HTC
in tube bundles with low length to diameter ratios.

As to the pure Lorentz-boosts, popular treatments on EM transformation
contemplate ideal geometries generating special static charge and steady

the boost-velocity) components of the fields so engendered; the outcomes
subsequently being suitably generalized. We demonstrate ab initio, the EM field
transformation under arbitrary oblique uniform relative boost velocities from a
broader, rigorous yet remarkably lucid perspective, exploiting the antisymmetry
of the EM-field tensor and symmetry of the general Lorentz-boost transformation
preemptively eliminating the labor of performing complicated matrix
multiplications. Gratifyingly, this instructive exercise manifestly encompasses
time varying fields and yields the transformation relations in a
coordinate-free form. Further, the EM field transformation under proper,
instantaneous 3D rotations is demonstrated to transform as a passive rotation
of the coordinate axes, where the electric and magnetic fields transform
independently as purely electric and magnetic fields, respectively. The present
didactical exercise, amenable to be incorporated in graduate courses on

powerful symmetry arguments simplify the otherwise tedious calculations while

selective encryption and selective blurring based on the region of interest.
Instead of encrypting or blurring the entire photograph, we only encode
selected regions of the image. We present a comparative analysis of the partial

encryption overhead without compromising security. The applications utilizing
this technique will become more usable due to the reduction in the decryption

multi-armed bandit (MAMAB) to deal with the situation where there are multiple

max-min bipartite matching problem at each communication round, by estimating
rewards with the upper confidence bound (UCB) approach. More importantly, we
propose two efficient solutions to this matching problem, i.e., modified
Hungarian algorithm and greedy matching with a better alternative (GMBA), in
which the first one can achieve the optimal solution with a high complexity

constitutive model is based on a set of polyconvex, anisotropic and objective
invariants. The second approach is formulated in terms of the deformation
gradient, its cofactor and determinant, uses group symmetrization to fulfill
the material symmetry condition, and data augmentation to fulfill objectivity
approximately. The extension of the dataset for the data augmentation approach
is based on mechanical considerations and does not require additional
experimental or simulation data. The models are calibrated with highly
challenging simulation data of cubic lattice metamaterials, including finite
deformations and lattice instabilities. A moderate amount of calibration data
is used, based on deformations which are commonly applied in experimental
investigations. While the invariant-based model shows drawbacks for several
deformation modes, the model based on the deformation gradient alone is able to

excellent generalization capabilities. In addition, the models are calibrated

data from digital attacks. With the increase in the scale of the Internet and
the evolution of cyber attacks, developing novel cybersecurity tools has become
important, particularly for Internet of things (IoT) networks. This paper
provides a systematic review of the application of deep learning (DL)
approaches for cybersecurity. This paper provides a short description of DL
methods which is used in cybersecurity, including deep belief networks,
generative adversarial networks, recurrent neural networks, and others. Next,
we illustrate the differences between shallow learning and DL. Moreover, a
discussion is provided on the currently prevailing cyber-attacks in IoT and
other networks, and the effectiveness of DL methods to manage these attacks.
Besides, this paper describes studies that highlight the DL technique,
cybersecurity applications, and the source of datasets. Next, a discussion is
provided on the feasibility of DL systems for malware detection and
classification, intrusion detection, and other frequent cyber-attacks,
including identifying file type, spam, and network traffic. Our review
indicates that high classification accuracy of 99.72% is obtained by restricted
Boltzmann machine (RBM) when applied to a custom dataset, while long short-term
memory (LSTM) achieves an accuracy of 99.80% for KDD Cup 99 dataset. Finally,
this article discusses the importance of cybersecurity for reliable and
practicable IoT-driven healthcare systems.

  for Legged Robots","8 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We propose a mechanically simple and cheap design for a series elastic
actuator with controllable stiffness. Such characteristics are necessary for
animals for running, jumping, throwing, and manipulation, yet in robots,
variable stiffness actuators are either complicated or mimicked at low
bandwidth through feedback controllers. A robust and simple design is needed to
build reliable and cheap robots with animal capabilities. The key insight of
our design is attaching torsional springs to timing belts to create a variable
stiffness linear spring. In an antagonistic pair, varying the distance between
motor and joint then varies the actuator stiffness. We build a prototype of our
proposed actuator, show the theoretical behavior matches the experimental
characterization, and demonstrate an application to robotic one-legged hopping.

  positioning via smartphones a valid solution?",,,"10.1007/978-3-030-94426-1_26",,"cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Tracking locations is practical and speditive with smartphones, as they are
omnipresent devices, relatively cheap, and have the necessary sensors for
positioning and networking integrated in the same box. Nowadays recent models
have GNSS antennas capable of receiving multiple constellations. In the
proposed work we test the hypothesis that GNSS positions directly recorded by
smartphones can be a valid solution for spatial analysis of people's behaviour
in an urban garden. Particular behaviours can be linked to therapeutic spots
that promote health and well-being of visitors. Three parts are reported: (i)
assessment of the accuracy of the positions relative to a reference track, (ii)
implementation of a framework for automating transmission and processing of the
location information, (iii) analysis of preferred spots via spatial analytics.
Different devices were used to survey at different times and with different
methods, i.e. in the pocket of the owner or on a rigid frame. Accuracy was
estimated using distance of each located point to the reference track, and
precision was estimated with static multiple measures. A chat-bot through the
Telegram application was implemented to allow users to send their data to a
centralized computing environment thus automating the spatial analysis. Results
report a horizontal accuracy below ~2.3 m at 95% confidence level, without
significant difference between surveys, and very little differences between
devices. GNSS-only and assisted navigation with telephone cells also did not
show significant difference. Autocorrelation of the residuals over time and
space showed strong consistency of the residuals, thus proving a valid solution
for spatial analysis of walking behaviour.

extensive studies have been devoted to developing both high fidelity and
computationally affordable models. Despite these efforts, modeling combustion
kinetics is still challenging due to the demand for expert knowledge and
optimization against experiments, as well as the lack of understanding of the
associated uncertainties. Therefore, data-driven approaches that enable
efficient discovery and calibration of kinetic models have received much
attention in recent years, the core of which is the optimization based on big
data. Differentiable programming is a promising approach for learning kinetic
models from data by efficiently computing the gradient of objective functions
to model parameters. However, it is often challenging to implement
differentiable programming in practice. Therefore, it is still not available in
widely utilized combustion simulation packages such as CHEMKIN and Cantera.
Here, we present a differentiable combustion simulation package leveraging the
eco-system in Julia, including DifferentialEquations.jl for solving
differential equations, ForwardDiff.jl for auto-differentiation, and Flux.jl
for incorporating neural network models into combustion simulations and
optimizing neural network models using the state-of-the-art deep learning
optimizers. We demonstrate the benefits of differentiable programming in
efficient and accurate gradient computations, with applications in uncertainty
quantification, kinetic model reduction, data assimilation, and model
discovery.

Conjugate Pair Sums (CCPSs) denoted as CCPS$^{(1)}$ and CCPS$^{(2)}$, and
discuss a few of their properties. Using each type of CCPSs and their circular
shifts, we construct two non-orthogonal Nested Periodic Matrices (NPMs). As
NPMs are non-singular, this introduces two non-orthogonal transforms known as
Complex Conjugate Periodic Transforms (CCPTs) denoted as CCPT$^{(1)}$ and
CCPT$^{(2)}$. We propose another NPM, which uses both types of CCPSs such that
its columns are mutually orthogonal, this transform is known as Orthogonal CCPT
(OCCPT). After a brief study of a few OCCPT properties like periodicity,
circular shift, etc., we present two different interpretations of it. Further,
we propose a Decimation-In-Time (DIT) based fast computation algorithm for
OCCPT (termed as FOCCPT), whenever the length of the signal is equal to $2^v,\
v{\in} \mathbb{N}$. The proposed sums and transforms are inspired by Ramanujan
sums and Ramanujan Period Transform (RPT). Finally, we show that the period
(both divisor and non-divisor) and frequency information of a signal can be
estimated using the proposed transforms with a significant reduction in the
computational complexity over Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).

descriptions of traffic flow in presence of autonomous and human--driven
vehicles. The autonomous cars considered in this paper are thought of as
vehicles endowed with some degree of autonomous driving which decreases the
stochasticity of the drivers' behavior. Compared to the existing literature, we
do not model autonomous cars as externally controlled vehicles. We investigate
whether this feature is enough to provide a stabilization of traffic
instabilities such as stop and go waves. We propose two indicators to quantify
traffic instability and we find, with analytical and numerical tools, that
traffic instabilities are damped as the penetration rate of the autonomous
vehicles increases.
