underwater world. Numerous techniques and algorithms have been developed in the
past decades. However, due to fundamental difficulties associated with
imaging/sensing, lighting, and refractive geometric distortions, in capturing
clear underwater images, no comprehensive evaluations have been conducted of
underwater image restoration. To address this gap, we have constructed a
large-scale real underwater image dataset, dubbed `HICRD' (Heron Island Coral
Reef Dataset), for the purpose of benchmarking existing methods and supporting
the development of new deep-learning based methods. We employ accurate water
parameter (diffuse attenuation coefficient) in generating reference images.
There are 2000 reference restored images and 6003 original underwater images in
the unpaired training set. Further, we present a novel method for underwater
image restoration based on unsupervised image-to-image translation framework.
Our proposed method leveraged contrastive learning and generative adversarial
networks to maximize the mutual information between raw and restored images.
Extensive experiments with comparisons to recent approaches further demonstrate
the superiority of our proposed method. Our code and dataset are publicly
available at GitHub.

  Content: Twitter as a Case Study",,"Linguistik International 2020",,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Although emotions are universal concepts, transferring the different shades
of emotion from one language to another may not always be straightforward for
human translators, let alone for machine translation systems. Moreover, the
cognitive states are established by verbal explanations of experience which is
shaped by both the verbal and cultural contexts. There are a number of verbal
contexts where expression of emotions constitutes the pivotal component of the
message. This is particularly true for User-Generated Content (UGC) which can
be in the form of a review of a product or a service, a tweet, or a social
media post. Recently, it has become common practice for multilingual websites
such as Twitter to provide an automatic translation of UGC to reach out to
their linguistically diverse users. In such scenarios, the process of
translating the user's emotion is entirely automatic with no human
intervention, neither for post-editing nor for accuracy checking. In this
research, we assess whether automatic translation tools can be a successful
real-life utility in transferring emotion in user-generated multilingual data
such as tweets. We show that there are linguistic phenomena specific of Twitter
data that pose a challenge in translation of emotions in different languages.
We summarise these challenges in a list of linguistic features and show how
frequent these features are in different language pairs. We also assess the
capacity of commonly used methods for evaluating the performance of an MT
system with respect to the preservation of emotion in the source text.

  parallel cluster randomized controlled trials","49 pages; updated Statistic (6) in Section 3.2; updated results in
  Section 5",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A practical limitation of cluster randomized controlled trials (cRCTs) is
that the number of available clusters may be small, resulting in an increased
risk of baseline imbalance under simple randomization. Constrained
randomization overcomes this issue by restricting the allocation to a subset of
randomization schemes where sufficient overall covariate balance across
comparison arms is achieved. However, for multi-arm cRCTs, several design and
analysis issues pertaining to constrained randomization have not been fully
investigated. Motivated by an ongoing multi-arm cRCT, we elaborate the method
of constrained randomization and provide a comprehensive evaluation of the
statistical properties of model-based and randomization-based tests under both
simple and constrained randomization designs in multi-arm cRCTs, with varying
combinations of design and analysis-based covariate adjustment strategies. In
particular, as randomization-based tests have not been extensively studied in
multi-arm cRCTs, we additionally develop most-powerful randomization tests
under the linear mixed model framework for our comparisons. Our results
indicate that under constrained randomization, both model-based and
randomization-based analyses could gain power while preserving nominal type I
error rate, given proper analysis-based adjustment for the baseline covariates.
Randomization-based analyses, however, are more robust against violations of
distributional assumptions. The choice of balance metrics and candidate set
sizes and their implications on the testing of the pairwise and global
hypotheses are also discussed. Finally, we caution against the design and
analysis of multi-arm cRCTs with an extremely small number of clusters, due to
insufficient degrees of freedom and the tendency to obtain an overly restricted
randomization space.

probabilities from a risk prediction model are inevitably uncertain. We apply
Value of Information methodology to evaluate the decision-theoretic
implications of prediction uncertainty.
  Methods: Adopting a Bayesian perspective, we extend the definition of the
Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) from decision analysis to net
benefit calculations in risk prediction. In the context of model development,
EVPI is the expected gain in net benefit by using the correct predictions as
opposed to predictions from a proposed model. We suggest bootstrap methods for
sampling from the posterior distribution of predictions for EVPI calculation
using Monte Carlo simulations. In a case study, we used subsets of data of
various sizes from a clinical trial for predicting mortality after myocardial
infarction to show how EVPI changes with sample size.
  Results: With a sample size of 1,000 and at the pre-specified threshold of 2%
on predicted risks, the gain in net benefit by using the proposed and the
correct models were 0.0006 and 0.0011, respectively, resulting in an EVPI of
0.0005 and a relative EVPI of 87%. EVPI was zero only at unrealistically high
thresholds (>85%). As expected, EVPI declined with larger samples. We summarize
an algorithm for incorporating EVPI calculations into the commonly used
bootstrap method for optimism correction.
  Conclusion: Value of Information methods can be applied to explore
decision-theoretic consequences of uncertainty in risk prediction and can
complement inferential methods when developing risk prediction models. R code
for implementing this method is provided.

Transformation regression models are widely used in applied econometrics to

an intermediate strategy that tries to balance advantages and disadvantages of
a fully parametric model and nonparametric models. A combination of
transformation and partially linear semiparametric model is, thus, a natural
strategy. The model parameters are estimated by a semiparametric extension of
the so called smooth minimum distance (SmoothMD) approach proposed by Lavergne
and Patilea (2013). SmoothMD is suitable for models defined by conditional
moment conditions and allows the variance of the error terms to depend on the
covariates. In addition, here we allow for infinite-dimension nuisance
parameters. The asymptotic behavior of the new SmoothMD estimator is studied
under general conditions and new inference methods are proposed. A simulation

is a versatile tool since it allows to selectively generate and amplify spin
waves. While extensively studied in microscopic systems, nano-scaled systems
are lacking investigation to assess the feasibility and potential future use of
parallel pumping in magnonics. Here, we investigate a longitudinally magnetized
100 nm-wide magnonic nano-conduit using space and time-resolved micro-focused
Brillouin-light-scattering spectroscopy. Employing parallel pumping to generate

is favored over the resonant excitation of short wavelength exchange spin
waves. In addition, we utilize this technique to access the effective spin-wave
relaxation time of an individual nano-conduit, observing a large relaxation
time up to (115.0 +- 7.6) ns. Despite the significant decrease of the pumping
effciency in the investigated nano-conduit, a reasonably small threshold is
found rendering parallel pumping feasible on the nano-scale.

representations that are important to clustering performance. Our contribution
is twofold. First, we find that a feature extractor trained on the labeled set
generates representations in which a generic query sample and its neighbors are
likely to share the same class. We exploit this observation to retrieve and
aggregate pseudo-positive pairs with contrastive learning, thus encouraging the
model to learn more discriminative representations. Second, we notice that most
of the instances are easily discriminated by the network, contributing less to
the contrastive loss. To overcome this issue, we propose to generate hard
negatives by mixing labeled and unlabeled samples in the feature space. We
experimentally demonstrate that these two ingredients significantly contribute
to clustering performance and lead our model to outperform state-of-the-art

cubature Rauch Tung Striebel (CRTS) smoother (WRWACRTS). The Unscented KF
(WRWUKF) has already existed as an alternative to nonlinear smoothing
solutions. In the proposed method, both windowing and random weighted
estimation methods are combined together and used to estimate the noise
statistics. Subsequently, the weights of each window are adjusting randomly,
and update the process and measurement noise covariances matrices at each
epoch. The developed WRWACRTS algorithm overcomes the limitation of the
conventional CKS. The Lyapunov function-based approach is used to investigate
the convergence proof of the WRWACRTS algorithm. A numerical example is shown
to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.

extended to the context of abelian categories, which has brought to light some

new way to measure, among other things, the exactness of complexes. In this
paper, we prove that the subprojectivity notion provides a new sight of

to further tune these processes by considering anisotropic Dirac cone

learning a single periodic neuron over isotropic Gaussian distributions in the
presence of noise. More precisely, our reduction shows that any polynomial-time
algorithm (not necessarily gradient-based) for learning such functions under
small noise implies a polynomial-time quantum algorithm for solving worst-case
lattice problems, whose hardness form the foundation of lattice-based
cryptography. Our core hard family of functions, which are well-approximated by
one-layer neural networks, take the general form of a univariate periodic
function applied to an affine projection of the data. These functions have
appeared in previous seminal works which demonstrate their hardness against
gradient-based (Shamir'18), and Statistical Query (SQ) algorithms (Song et
al.'17). We show that if (polynomially) small noise is added to the labels, the
intractability of learning these functions applies to all polynomial-time
algorithms, beyond gradient-based and SQ algorithms, under the aforementioned
cryptographic assumptions. Moreover, we demonstrate the necessity of noise in
the hardness result by designing a polynomial-time algorithm for learning
certain families of such functions under exponentially small adversarial noise.
Our proposed algorithm is not a gradient-based or an SQ algorithm, but is
rather based on the celebrated Lenstra-Lenstra-Lov\'asz (LLL) lattice basis
reduction algorithm. Furthermore, in the absence of noise, this algorithm can
be directly applied to solve CLWE detection (Bruna et al.'21) and phase
retrieval with an optimal sample complexity of $d+1$ samples. In the former
case, this improves upon the quadratic-in-$d$ sample complexity required in

that the perturbation corrections to energies entering the recursions have to
be treated as a nondiagonal matrix, whose off-diagonal elements are generally
nonzero within a subspace spanned by degenerate Slater determinants. They give
rise to a unique set of linked diagrams -- renormalization diagrams -- whose
resolvent lines are displaced downwards, which are distinct from the well-known
anomalous diagrams of which one or more resolvent lines are erased. A
linked-diagram theorem is introduced that proves the size-consistency of the

solution for low-income single pane window users. To provide controllable and
stable suspension force between large size compliant polymer films without
deteriorating their visual transmittance (Vt), corona discharge (CD) was
induced to permanently charge polymer films, leading to controllable permanent
surface potential difference between two sides of CD charged films.
Liquid-solid contact electrification (CE) was combined with CD to realize
precise control of the surface potential of each side of polymer films. CD+CE
treated films can obtain programmable and stable electrostatic forces to form
resilient EPAM structures for cost and energy effective window retrofitting
purpose. The resilient EPAM retrofitted windows can provide U-factor lower than

than $7.4/ft2, at least 10 times cheaper than double pane windows. The energy
saved by EPAM can reach as much as the order of 106 kJ/m2 per year. The CD+CE

rank-$(L_r,L_r,1)$ version, has been recently receiving increasing attention
due to its enhanced ability of representing systems and signals that are
composed of \emph{block} components of rank higher than one, a scenario
encountered in numerous and diverse applications. Its uniqueness and
approximation have thus been thoroughly studied. The challenging problem of
estimating the BTD model structure, namely the number of block terms (rank) and
their individual (block) ranks, is of crucial importance in practice and has
only recently started to attract significant attention. In data-streaming
scenarios and/or big data applications, where the tensor dimension in one of
its modes grows in time or can only be processed incrementally, it is essential
to be able to perform model selection and computation in a recursive
(incremental/online) manner. To date there is only one such work in the
literature concerning the (general rank-$(L,M,N)$) BTD model, which proposes an
incremental method, however with the BTD rank and block ranks assumed to be
a-priori known and time invariant. In this preprint, a novel approach to
rank-$(L_r,L_r,1)$ BTD model selection and tracking is proposed, based on the
idea of imposing column sparsity jointly on the factors and estimating the
ranks as the numbers of factor columns of nonnegligible magnitude. An online
method of the alternating iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) type is
developed and shown to be computationally efficient and fast converging, also
allowing the model ranks to change in time. Its time and memory efficiency are
evaluated and favorably compared with those of the batch approach. Simulation

wurzite(w), tetragonal (t), hexagonal (h), and orthorhombic (o) have been tuned
using the first principle calculations based on density functional theory
(DFT). We invoked the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional and the projected
augmented wave (PAW) method during all the calculations. Based on our numerical
results, we predicted the novel tetragonal phase as stable phase of ZnSb next
to existing orthorhombic structure. We reported the pressure induced phase
transition between orthorhombic to tetragonal phase at 12.48 GPa/atom. The
projected density of states indicates the strong p-d hybridization between
Sb-5p and Zn-3d states confirming the nature of strong covalent bonding between
them. The electronic band structures suggest that t-ZnSb, w-ZnSb, and h-ZnSb
are metallic in nature whereas o-ZnSb is semiconducting with narrow band gap of
0.03 eV using PBE. We predicted the possibility of extracting the two
dimensional (2D) monolayer sheet in t-ZnSb and o-ZnSb according to the
exfoliation energy criterion. In addition, the 2D monolayer (ML) of o-ZnSb has
been predicted to be dynamically stable but that of t-ZnSb is not stable as
manifested in phonon dispersion bands. Surprisingly, the semiconducting band
gap nature of o-ZnSb changes from indirect and narrow to direct and sizable
while going from 3D bulk to 2D ML structure. Further, we estimated the value of
work functions for the surfaces of t-ZnSb and o-ZnSb as 4.61 eV and 4.04 eV
respectively. Such materials can find the niche applications in next generation
electronic devices utilizing 2D hetero-structures.

we accurately identify all new infections that happen every day, without this

are infected independently, while infections are governed by community spread.
Epidemiology, on the other hand, does explore time dynamics and community

canonical scalar field inflation. Particularly, we shall assume that the scalar
field satisfies the condition $\ddot{\phi}=\alpha (\phi) V'(\phi)$, and we
derive the field equations under this assumption. We call the framework
extended constant-roll framework. Accordingly we calculate the inflationary
indices and the corresponding observational indices of inflation. In order to
demonstrate the inflationary viability, we choose three potentials that are
problematic in the context of slow-roll dynamics, namely chaotic, linear
power-law and exponential inflation, and by choosing a simple power-law form
for the smooth function $\alpha (\phi)$, we show that in the extended
constant-roll framework, the models are compatible with the latest 2018 Planck
constraints on inflation. We also justify appropriately why we called this new
framework extended constant-roll framework, and we show that the condition
$\ddot{\phi}=\alpha (\phi) V'(\phi)$ is equivalent to the condition
$\ddot{\phi}=\beta (\phi) H \dot{\phi}$, with the latter condition being a
simple generalization of the constant-roll condition. Finally, we examine an
interesting physical situation, in which a general extended constant-roll
scalar field model is required to satisfy the cosmological tracker condition
used in quintessence models. In contrast to the slow-roll and ordinary
constant-roll cases, in which case the tracker condition is not compatible with
neither the slow-roll or the ordinary constant-roll conditions, the extended
constant-roll condition can be compatible with the tracker condition. This
feature leads to a new inflationary phenomenological framework, the essential
features of which we develop in brief.

aims to optimize the policy solely from the data without further environment

source of difficulty, which arises from the deviation of the target policy
being optimized from the behavior policy used for data collection. This
typically causes overestimation of action values, which poses severe problems
for model-free algorithms that use bootstrapping. To mitigate the problem,
prior offline RL algorithms often used sophisticated techniques that encourage
underestimation of action values, which introduces an additional set of
hyperparameters that need to be tuned properly. In this paper, we present an
offline RL algorithm that prevents overestimation in a more principled way. Our
algorithm, OptiDICE, directly estimates the stationary distribution corrections
of the optimal policy and does not rely on policy-gradients, unlike previous
offline RL algorithms. Using an extensive set of benchmark datasets for offline

mainstream of neural architecture search (NAS) due to its efficiency and

optimizes the inner model weights and the outer architecture parameter in a
weight-sharing supernet. A key challenge to the scalability and quality of the
learned architectures is the need for differentiating through the inner-loop
optimisation. While much has been discussed about several potentially fatal
factors in DARTS, the architecture gradient, a.k.a. hypergradient, has received
less attention. In this paper, we tackle the hypergradient computation in DARTS
based on the implicit function theorem, making it only depends on the obtained
solution to the inner-loop optimization and agnostic to the optimization path.
To further reduce the computational requirements, we formulate a stochastic
hypergradient approximation for differentiable NAS, and theoretically show that
the architecture optimization with the proposed method, named iDARTS, is
expected to converge to a stationary point. Comprehensive experiments on two
NAS benchmark search spaces and the common NAS search space verify the
effectiveness of our proposed method. It leads to architectures outperforming,

Our approach represents source code as abstract syntax trees and uses tree

associated with the generation of observable scalar induced gravitational waves

predict double peaks of order $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ in the power spectrum and
study the effects of primordial non-Gaussianity on PBHs and SIGWs. This model
is driven by a power-law potential, and has a noncanonical kinetic term whose
coupling function admits two peaks. By field-redefinition, it can be recast

\Delta^2_{\zeta}(k_{\mathrm{peak}})/(23\delta^3_c) \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$.
Whether the PBH abundance is suppressed or enhanced depends on the

non-Gaussianity parameter
$f_{\mathrm{NL}}(k_{\mathrm{peak}},k_{\mathrm{peak}},k_{\mathrm{peak}})\sim

argument $\sigma = \varpi$ ($\varpi$ is the longitude of pericentre) for inner
test particles moving in low-eccentricity region with inclination $i$ smaller
than $39^{\circ}$. To formulate the dynamical model, the double-averaged
Hamiltonian is formulated up to an arbitrary order in the semimajor axis ratio,
and then those high-order periodic terms are removed from the double-averaged
Hamiltonian by means of Hori--Deprit transformation technique. The resulting
Hamiltonian determines a resonant model with a single degree of freedom. Based
on the resonant model, it becomes possible to explore the phase-space
structure, resonant centre, and resonant width in an analytical manner. In
particular, an excellent correspondence is found between the resonant width in
terms of the eccentricity variation and the maximum variation of eccentricity
($\Delta e$) for test particles initially placed on quasi-circular orbits. It
means that the secular dynamics in the low-eccentricity space with $i <
39^{\circ}$ is dominantly governed by the secular resonance associated with

of supervoxels into image regions. Here we describe a distributed algorithm
capable of handling a tremendous number of supervoxels. The algorithm works
recursively, the regions are divided into chunks that are processed
independently in parallel by multiple workers. At each round of the recursive
procedure, the chunk size in all dimensions are doubled until a single chunk
encompasses the entire image. The final result is provably independent of the
chunking scheme, and the same as if the entire image were processed without
division into chunks. This is nontrivial because a pair of adjacent regions is
scored by some statistical property (e.g. mean or median) of the affinities at
the interface, and the interface may extend over arbitrarily many chunks. The
trick is to delay merge decisions for regions that touch chunk boundaries, and
only complete them in a later round after the regions are fully contained
within a chunk. We demonstrate the algorithm by clustering an affinity graph
with over 1.5 trillion edges between 135 billion supervoxels derived from a 3D

learned, however normal vectors are often not provided as raw data.
Furthermore, the method's initialization has been shown to play a crucial role

We show that incorporating a soft constraint on the divergence of the distance

classifcation performance on unlabeled target domain. To alleviate the adverse
effect of domain shift, many approaches align the source and target domains in
the feature space. However, a feature is usually taken as a whole for alignment
without explicitly making domain alignment proactively serve the classifcation
task, leading to sub-optimal solution. In this paper, we propose an effective
Task-oriented Alignment (ToAlign) for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). We
study what features should be aligned across domains and propose to make the
domain alignment proactively serve classifcation by performing feature
decomposition and alignment under the guidance of the prior knowledge induced
from the classifcation task itself. Particularly, we explicitly decompose a
feature in the source domain into a task-related/discriminative feature that
should be aligned, and a task-irrelevant feature that should be
avoided/ignored, based on the classifcation meta-knowledge. Extensive
experimental results on various benchmarks (e.g., Offce-Home, Visda-2017, and
DomainNet) under different domain adaptation settings demonstrate the
effectiveness of ToAlign which helps achieve the state-of-the-art performance.

whose values for different items are dependent. Under arbitrary dependence,
Hart and Nisan show that no simple mechanism can achieve a non-negligible
fraction of the optimal revenue even with only two items. We consider the
setting where the buyer's type is drawn from a correlated distribution that can
be captured by a Markov Random Field, one of the most prominent frameworks for
modeling high-dimensional distributions with structure.
  If the buyer's valuation is additive or unit-demand, we extend the result to
all MRFs and show that max(SRev,BRev) can achieve an
$\Omega\left(\frac{1}{e^{O(\Delta)}}\right)$-fraction of the optimal revenue,
where $\Delta$ is a parameter of the MRF that is determined by how much the
value of an item can be influenced by the values of the other items. We further
show that the exponential dependence on $\Delta$ is unavoidable for our
approach and a polynomial dependence on $\Delta$ is unavoidable for any
approach. When the buyer has a XOS valuation, we show that max(Srev,Brev)
achieves at least an
$\Omega\left(\frac{1}{e^{O(\Delta)}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n\gamma}}}\right)$-fraction

dynamics of the MRF. Note that in the special case of independently distributed
items, $\Delta=0$ and $\frac{1}{n\gamma}\leq 1$, and our results recover the
known constant factor approximations for a XOS buyer. We further extend our
parametric approximation to several other well-studied dependency measures such

SGG as a direct set prediction, this paper presents a simple, sparse, and
unified framework, termed as Structured Sparse R-CNN. The key to our method is
a set of learnable triplet queries and a structured triplet detector which
could be jointly optimized from the training set in an end-to-end manner.
Specifically, the triplet queries encode the general prior for object pairs
with their relations, and provide an initial guess of scene graphs for
subsequent refinement. The triplet detector presents a cascaded architecture to
progressively refine the detected scene graphs with the customized dynamic

propose a relaxed and enhanced training strategy based on knowledge

  Sentiment Analysis","Accepted by Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR) 2022",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to predict the sentiment
expressed in a review with respect to a given aspect. The core of ABSA is to
model the interaction between the context and given aspect to extract the
aspect-related information. In prior work, attention mechanisms and dependency
graph networks are commonly adopted to capture the relations between the
context and given aspect. And the weighted sum of context hidden states is used
as the final representation fed to the classifier. However, the information
related to the given aspect may be already discarded and adverse information
may be retained in the context modeling processes of existing models. This
problem cannot be solved by subsequent modules and there are two reasons:
first, their operations are conducted on the encoder-generated context hidden
states, whose value cannot change after the encoder; second, existing encoders
only consider the context while not the given aspect. To address this problem,
we argue the given aspect should be considered as a new clue out of context in
the context modeling process. As for solutions, we design several aspect-aware
context encoders based on different backbones: an aspect-aware LSTM and three
aspect-aware BERTs. They are dedicated to generate aspect-aware hidden states
which are tailored for ABSA task. In these aspect-aware context encoders, the
semantics of the given aspect is used to regulate the information flow.
Consequently, the aspect-related information can be retained and
aspect-irrelevant information can be excluded in the generated hidden states.
We conduct extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets with empirical
analysis, demonstrating the efficacies and advantages of our proposed
aspect-aware context encoders.

EM. Panda uses the same labeling function abstraction as Snorkel, where
labeling functions (LF) are user-provided programs that can generate large
amounts of (somewhat noisy) labels quickly and cheaply, which can then be
combined via a labeling model to generate accurate final predictions. To
support users developing LFs for EM, Panda provides an integrated development
environment (IDE) that lives in a modern browser architecture. Panda's IDE
facilitates the development, debugging, and life-cycle management of LFs in the
context of EM tasks, similar to how IDEs such as Visual Studio or Eclipse excel
in general-purpose programming. Panda's IDE includes many novel features
purpose-built for EM, such as smart data sampling, a builtin library of EM
utility functions, automatically generated LFs, visual debugging of LFs, and
finally, an EM-specific labeling model. We show in this demo that Panda IDE can
greatly accelerate the development of high-quality EM solutions using weak

from the Ni $3d$-orbital wave functions localized at triangular motifs within
the kagome lattice plane, where an underlying destructive interference among
hopping paths flattens the dispersion. We observe unusual metallic and
thermodynamic responses suggestive of the presence of local fluctuating

Specifically, we use explicit labels to represent two typical spontaneous
behaviors filled-pause and prolongation in the acoustic model and develop a
neural network based predictor to predict the occurrences of the two behaviors
from text. We subsequently develop an algorithm based on the predictor to
control the occurrence frequency of the behaviors, making the synthesized
speech vary from less disfluent to more disfluent. To model the speech
entrainment at acoustic level, we utilize a context acoustic encoder to extract
a global style embedding from the previous speech conditioning on the
synthesizing of current speech. Furthermore, since the current and previous
utterances belong to the different speakers in a conversation, we add a domain
adversarial training module to eliminate the speaker-related information in the

derive sufficient estimates for solutions through some single evolution

  Auto-Encoder For High Fidelity Flow-based Speech Synthesis","Accepted to INTERSPEECH 2021",,,,"eess.AS cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Current two-stage TTS framework typically integrates an acoustic model with a
vocoder -- the acoustic model predicts a low resolution intermediate
representation such as Mel-spectrum while the vocoder generates waveform from
the intermediate representation. Although the intermediate representation is
served as a bridge, there still exists critical mismatch between the acoustic
model and the vocoder as they are commonly separately learned and work on
different distributions of representation, leading to inevitable artifacts in
the synthesized speech. In this work, different from using pre-designed
intermediate representation in most previous studies, we propose to use VAE
combining with GAN to learn a latent representation directly from speech and
then utilize a flow-based acoustic model to model the distribution of the
latent representation from text. In this way, the mismatch problem is migrated
as the two stages work on the same distribution. Results demonstrate that the
flow-based acoustic model can exactly model the distribution of our learned
speech representation and the proposed TTS framework, namely Glow-WaveGAN, can
produce high fidelity speech outperforming the state-of-the-art GAN-based
model.

considerable attention is attracted to leverage multi-instance learning (MIL)

noise and identify the key bottleneck of DS-MIL to be its low data utilization:
as high-quality supervision being refined by MIL, MIL abandons a large amount
of training instances, which leads to a low data utilization and hinders model
training from having abundant supervision. In this paper, we propose
collaborative adversarial training to improve the data utilization, which
coordinates virtual adversarial training (VAT) and adversarial training (AT) at
different levels. Specifically, since VAT is label-free, we employ the
instance-level VAT to recycle instances abandoned by MIL. Besides, we deploy AT
at the bag-level to unleash the full potential of the high-quality supervision
got by MIL. Our proposed method brings consistent improvements (~ 5 absolute

the data utilization issue and the effectiveness of our method.

variables in a data-rich environment. Using a panel of U.S. macroeconomic data
set, made up of 132 quarterly macroeconomic series for 1959-2018, the study
estimates factor-augmented vector autoregression (FAVARs) models where an
extended narrative tax changes dataset combined with unobserved factors. The
narrative approach classifies if tax changes are exogenous or endogenous. This
paper identifies narrative tax shocks in the vector autoregression model using
the sign restrictions with Uhlig's (2005) penalty function. Empirical findings
show a significant expansionary effect of tax cuts on the macroeconomic
variables. Cuts in personal and corporate income taxes cause a rise in output,
investment, employment, and consumption; however, cuts in personal taxes appear
to be a more effective fiscal policy tool than the cut in corporate income
taxes. Real GDP, employment, investment, and industrial production increase
significantly and reach their maximum response values two years after personal
income tax cuts. The effects of corporate tax cuts have relatively smaller
effects on output and consumption but show immediate and higher effects on
fixed investment and price levels.

the amount of labeled data. Recently, generative modeling has shown excellent
results in generating photo-realistic images, which can alleviate the need for
annotations. However, adopting such generative models to new domains while
maintaining their ability to provide fine-grained control over different image
attributes, \eg, gaze and head pose directions, has been a challenging problem.
This paper proposes CUDA-GHR, an unsupervised domain adaptation framework that
enables fine-grained control over gaze and head pose directions while
preserving the appearance-related factors of the person. Our framework
simultaneously learns to adapt to new domains and disentangle visual attributes
such as appearance, gaze direction, and head orientation by utilizing a
label-rich source domain and an unlabeled target domain. Extensive experiments
on the benchmarking datasets show that the proposed method can outperform
state-of-the-art techniques on both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.
Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of generated image-label pairs in
the target domain for pretraining networks for the downstream task of gaze and
head pose estimation. The source code and pre-trained models are available at

observations of starburst galaxies revealed the presence of compact regions
with suppressed superwinds and strongly radiative cooling, i.e., catastrophic
cooling. In the present study, we employ the non-equilibrium atomic chemistry
and cooling package MAIHEM, built on the FLASH hydrodynamics code, to generate
a grid of models investigating the dependence of cooling modes on the

plays a substantial role, catastrophic cooling is more sensitive to high
mass-loading and reduced kinetic heating efficiency. Our hydrodynamic
simulations indicate that the presence of a hot superbubble does not
necessarily imply an adiabatic outflow, and vice versa. Using CLOUDY
photoionization models, we predict UV and optical line emission for both
adiabatic and catastrophic cooling outflows, for radiation-bounded and
partially density-bounded models. Although the line ratios predicted by our
radiation-bounded models agree well with observations of star-forming galaxies,
they do not provide diagnostics that unambiguously distinguish the parameter
space of catastrophically cooling flows. Comparison with observations suggests
the possibility of minor density bounding, non-equilibrium ionization, and/or
observational bias toward the central outflow regions.

multi-instance learning (MIL) framework to find the most reliable feature from
a bag of sentences. Although the pattern of MIL bags can greatly reduce DS
noise, it fails to represent many other useful sentence features in the
datasets. In many cases, these sentence features can only be acquired by extra
sentence-level human annotation with heavy costs. Therefore, the performance of
distantly supervised RE models is bounded. In this paper, we go beyond typical
MIL framework and propose a novel contrastive instance learning (CIL)

modes at different positions of the microcavity. Once graphene is added, it can
govern the transmittance of three modes. When graphene is located in the
abdomen of the standing wave, which has strong light absorption and therefore
the structure's transmittance is lower, or when graphene is located in the node

different colors of light can be regulated dynamically by applying voltages to
tune the equilibrium position of the graphene MEMS in the microcavity,
consequently realizing the output of vivid monochromatic light or multiple

  Computation",,,,"math.CO math.AC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Given a simple undirected graph $G$ there is a simplicial complex
$\mathrm{Ind}(G)$, called the independence complex, whose faces correspond to
the independent sets of $G$. This is a well studied concept because it provides
a fertile ground for interactions between commutative algebra, graph theory and
algebraic topology. One of the line of research pursued by many authors is to
determine the graph classes for which the associated independence complex is
Cohen-Macaulay. For example, it is known that when $G$ is a chordal graph the
complex $\mathrm{Ind}(G)$ is in fact vertex decomposable, the strongest
condition in the Cohen-Macaulay ladder.
  In this article we consider a generalization of independence complex. Given
$r\geq 1$, a subset of the vertex set is called $r$-independent if the
connected components of the induced subgraph have cardinality at most $r$. The
collection of all $r$-independent subsets of $G$ form a simplicial complex
called the $r$-independence complex and is denoted by $\mathrm{Ind}_r(G)$. It
is known that when $G$ is a chordal graph the complex $\mathrm{Ind}_r(G)$ has
the homotopy type of a wedge of spheres. Hence it is natural to ask which of
these complexes are shellable or even vertex decomposable. We prove, using
Woodroofe's chordal hypergraph notion, that these complexes are always
shellable when the underlying chordal graph is a tree. Further, using the
notion of vertex splittable ideals we show that for caterpillar graphs the
associated $r$-independence complex is vertex decomposable for all values of
$r$. We also construct chordal graphs on $2r+2$ vertices such that their
$r$-independence complexes are not sequentially Cohen-Macaulay for any $r \ge
2$.

attention of researchers at the Institute of Physics of the Earth, Russian

equation allows us to introduce the concept of the source deactivation factor

environment in the earthquake source, ""cooling down"" after the main shock. The
Verhulst logistic equation makes it possible to take into account the
transition of the aftershock flow to the background seismicity mode. The
Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov nonlinear diffusion equation is convenient for
modeling the spatio-temporal evolution of aftershocks. This paper focuses on
the phase portrait of a dynamical system that simulates the evolution of
aftershocks. The phase portrait allows us to understand why the Omori
hyperbolic law is most clearly manifested after strong earthquakes. It is noted
that the Omori epoch, during which the deactivation coefficient is constant,
does not immediately end with a transition to the background mode. In the
experience after the end of the Omori epoch, the deactivation coefficient
changes over time in a rather complex way, and can even becomes negative. The
theory predicts that if negative values of the coefficient are held long
enough, then a geotectonic explosion occurs, vaguely resembling the main shock

Specifically, we consider the following training algorithms on separable data:
(i) empirical risk minimization (ERM) with cross-entropy loss, which converges
to the multiclass support vector machine (SVM) solution; (ii) ERM with
least-squares loss, which converges to the min-norm interpolating (MNI)
solution; and, (iii) the one-vs-all SVM classifier. First, we provide a simple
sufficient deterministic condition under which all three algorithms lead to
classifiers that interpolate the training data and have equal accuracy. When
the data is generated from Gaussian mixtures or a multinomial logistic model,
this condition holds under high enough effective overparameterization. We also
show that this sufficient condition is satisfied under ""neural collapse"", a
phenomenon that is observed in training deep neural networks. Second, we derive
novel bounds on the accuracy of the MNI classifier, thereby showing that all
three training algorithms lead to benign overfitting under sufficient
overparameterization. Ultimately, our analysis shows that good generalization

a bandgap of nearly 2.2 eV with gap states due to significant defect density.
The temperature dependent electrical conductivity and thermopower measurements
clearly demonstrate a polaronic conduction mechanism of small polaron hopping
with hopping energy of about 0.112 eV. The V2O5 sample shows a strong field as
well as temperature dependent magnetic behavior when measured using a sensitive
SQUID magnetometer. It shows a positive magnetic susceptibility over the entire
temperature range (2- 350 K). The FC-ZFC data shows clear hysteresis indicating
glassy behavior with dominant superparamagnetism (SPM). The Curie-Weiss fitting
confirms the AFM to PM transition at nearly 280 K and the curie constant yields
1.56 muB which is close to single electron moment. The small polaron formation,
which arises due to oxygen vacancy defects compensated by charge defects of
V4+, results in Magneto-Electronic Phase Separation (MEPS) and hence various
magnetic exchanges, as predicted by first principle calculations. This is
further revealed as strong hybridization of V bonded to oxygen vacancy VO and
neighboring V5+ ions, resulting in net magnetic moment per vacancy (1.77 muB
which is in good agreement with experiment). Besides, the rise in V4+ defects
is found to show AFM component as observed from the calculations. Thus, the
diversity in magnetism of undoped V2O5 has its origin in defect number density
as well as their random distribution led to MEPS. This involves localized spins
in polarons and their FM clusters on the PM background while, V4+ dimers within
and across the ladder, inducing AFM interactions.

English is of a non-native kind, and their conversations are of a code-mixed
fashion. The intelligibility of a bilingual text-to-speech (TTS) system for
such non-native English speakers depends on a lexicon that captures the phoneme
sequence used by non-native speakers. However, due to the lack of non-native
English lexicon, existing bilingual TTS systems employ native English lexicons
that are widely available, in addition to their native language lexicon. Due to
the inconsistency between the non-native English pronunciation in the audio and
native English lexicon in the text, the intelligibility of synthesized speech
in such TTS systems is significantly reduced.
  This paper is motivated by the knowledge that the native language of the
speaker highly influences non-native English pronunciation. We propose a
generic approach to obtain rules based on letter to phoneme alignment to map
native English lexicon to their non-native version. The effectiveness of such
mapping is studied by comparing bilingual (Indian English and Hindi) TTS
systems trained with and without the proposed rules. The subjective evaluation
shows that the bilingual TTS system trained with the proposed non-native

underlines many of the discoveries and device applications since the laser was

squeezed-state production and optical transduction from the visible to infrared
wavelengths. For quantum dot systems, the basic understanding of FWM is limited
by the conventional investigation method, which concentrates on the FWM
susceptibility measured with optical amplifiers. This paper addresses this
weakness by performing laser experiments to account for all optical
nonlinearities contributing to the FWM signal. Meanwhile, we gain valuable
insight into the intricate interplay among optical nonlinearities. Using
quantum dot lasers directly grown on silicon, we achieved FWM conversion
efficiency sufficient to demonstrate self-mode-locking in a single-section
laser diode, with sub-ps mode-locked pulse duration and kHz frequency-comb
linewidth. A comparison with first-principles based multimode laser theory
indicates measured FWM conversion efficiencies that are close to the
theoretical limit. An advantage over earlier studies and crucial to confidence
in the results are the quality and reproducibility of state-of-the-art quantum
dot lasers. They make possible the detailed study of conversion efficiency over
a broad parameter space, and the identification of the importance of p-doping.
Systematic improvement based on our understanding of underlying physics will
lead to transform limited performance and effective compensation of intrinsic

index addition mod $n$) as a starting point, we introduce a broader class of
cyclic sums, called generalized Shapiro-Diananda sums, where the denominators
are $p$-th order power means of the sets $\{x_{i+j_1},\dots,x_{i+j_k}\}$ with
fixed distinct integers $j_1,\dots,j_k$ and $1\leq i\leq n$.
  Generalizing further, we replace the set of arguments of the power mean in
the $i$-th denominator by an arbitrary nonempty subset of $\{1,\dots,n\}$
interpreted as the set of out-neighbors of the node number $i$ in a directed
graph with $n$ nodes. We call such sums graphic power sums since their
structure is controlled by directed graphs.
  The inquiry, as in the well-researched case of Shapiro's sums, concerns the
greatest lower bound of the given ``sum'' as a function of positive variables
$x_1,\dots,x_n$. We show that the cases of $p=+\infty$ (max-sums) and
$p=-\infty$ (min-sums) are tractable.
  For the max-sum associated with a given graph the g.l.b. is always an
integer; for a strongly connected graph it equals to graph's girth.
  For the similar min-sum, we could not relate the g.l.b. to a known
combinatorial invariant; we only give some estimates and describe a method for
finding the g.l.b., which has factorial complexity in $n$.
  A satisfactory analytical treatment is available for the secondary
minimization -- when the g.l.b.'s of min-sums for individual graphs are
mininized over the class of strongly connected graphs with $n$ nodes. The
result (depending only on $n$) is found to be asymptotic to $e\ln n$.

Existing models are limited to either spherical symmetry or assume an ocean
with infinite conductivity. In this work, we derive an analytic result capable
of determining the induced magnetic moments for an arbitrary, layered body.
Crucially, we find that degree-2 tidal deformation results in changes to the
induced dipole moments. We demonstrate application of our results to models of
plausible asymmetry from the literature within the oceans of Europa and Miranda
and the ionospheres of Callisto and Triton. For the models we consider, we find
that in the asymmetric case, the induced magnetic field differs by more than 2
nT near the surface of Europa, 0.25$-$0.5 nT at 1 $R$ above Miranda and Triton,
and is essentially unchanged for Callisto. For Miranda and Triton, this
difference is as much as 20$-$30% of the induced field magnitude. If
measurements near the moons can be made precisely to better than a few tenths
of a nT, these values may be used by future spacecraft investigations to
characterize asymmetry within the interior of icy moons.

we use meta relations to decompose high-order connectivity between node pairs

demonstrated that the proposed method for model uncertainty characterization
and estimation can produce more reliable confidence scores for radiology report
generation, and the modified loss function, which takes into account the
uncertainties, leads to better model performance on two public radiology report
datasets. In addition, the quality of the automatically generated reports was
manually evaluated by human raters and the results also indicate that the

this paper, we empirically show that open-set noisy labels can be non-toxic and

Open-set samples with Dynamic Noisy Labels (ODNL) into training. With ODNL, the
extra capacity of the neural network can be largely consumed in a way that does
not interfere with learning patterns from clean data. Through the lens of SGD
noise, we show that the noises induced by our method are random-direction,
conflict-free and biased, which may help the model converge to a flat minimum
with superior stability and enforce the model to produce conservative
predictions on Out-of-Distribution instances. Extensive experimental results on
benchmark datasets with various types of noisy labels demonstrate that the

consisting of a sample space $X$, a field of subsets $\mathcal{A}$ and a
finitely additive measure $\mu$, also known as a charge. Key properties a
real-valued function on $X$ may possess include $T_1$-measurability and
integrability. These properties are generalisations of corresponding properties
of real-valued functions on a (countably additive) measure space. However,
these properties are less well studied than their measure-theoretic
counterparts.
  This paper describes new characterisations of $T_1$-measurability and
integrability in the case that the charge space is bounded, that is, $\mu(X) <
\infty$. These characterisations are convenient for analytic purposes; for
example, they facilitate simple proofs that $T_1$-measurability is equivalent
to conventional measurability and integrability is equivalent to Lebesgue
integrability, if $(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$ is a complete measure space.
  Several additional contributions to the theory of bounded charges are also
presented. New characterisations of equality almost everywhere of two
real-valued functions on a bounded charge space are provided. Necessary and
sufficient conditions for the function space $L_1(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$ to be a
Banach space are determined. Lastly, the concept of completion of a measure
space is generalised for charge spaces, and it is shown that under certain
conditions, completion of a charge space adds no new equivalence classes to the
quotient space $\mathcal{L}_p(X,\mathcal{A},\mu)$.

in the form of a non-commutative parallel composition are added, which
generalises the interchange monoids used for modelling series-parallel posets.
We also study the gluing-parallel hierarchy of iposets, which generalises the
standard series-parallel one. The class of gluing-parallel iposets contains
that of series-parallel posets and the class of interval orders, which are well
studied in concurrency theory, too. We also show that it is strictly contained

matter. Such phases are abstractly characterized by their non-vanishing chiral
central charge $c$, a topological invariant which appears as the coefficient of
a gravitational Chern-Simons (gCS) action in bulk, and of corresponding
gravitational anomalies at boundaries. The chiral central charge is of
particular importance in chiral superfluids and superconductors (CSF/Cs), where
$U(1)$ particle-number symmetry is broken, and $c$ is, in some cases, the only
topological invariant characterizing the system. However, as opposed to
invariants which can be probed by gauge fields in place of gravity, the
concrete physical implications of $c$ in the context of condensed matter
physics is quite subtle, and has been the subject of ongoing research and
controversy. The first two parts of this thesis are devoted to the physical
interpretation of the gCS action and gravitational anomalies in the context of
CSF/Cs, where they are of particular importance, but have nevertheless remained
poorly understood. We then turn to a seemingly unrelated aspect of chiral
topological phases - their computational complexity. The infamous $sign\
problem$ leads to an exponential complexity in Monte Carlo simulations of
generic many-body quantum systems. Nevertheless, many phases of matter are
known to admit a sign-problem-free representative, allowing an efficient
classical simulation. The possibility of $intrinsic$ sign problems, where a
phase of matter admits no sign-problem-free representative, was recently raised
but remains largely unexplored. Here, we establish the existence of an
intrinsic sign problem in a broad class of chiral topological phases, both
bosonic and fermionic, defined by the requirement that $e^{2\pi i c/24}$ is
$not$ the topological spin of an anyon.

gradient into irrotational straining flow, shear flow and rigid body rotational
flow was proposed by Kolar in 2007 [V. Kolar, International journal of heat and
fluid flow, 28, 638, (2007)], which has recently received renewed interest. The
triple decomposition opens for a refined energy stability analysis of the
Navier-Stokes equations, with implications for the mathematical analysis of the
structure, computability and regularity of turbulent flow. We here perform an
energy stability analysis of turbulent incompressible flow, which suggests a
scenario where at macroscopic scales any exponentially unstable irrotational
straining flow structures rapidly evolve towards linearly unstable shear flow
and stable rigid body rotational flow. This scenario does not rule out
irrotational straining flow close to the Kolmogorov microscales, since there
viscous dissipation stabilizes the unstable flow structures. In contrast to
worst case energy stability estimates, this refined stability analysis reflects
the existence of stable flow structures in turbulence over extended time.

that the hopping amplitudes are dependent on the interatomic distance, and
derive a physically realistic model of distance-dependent hopping amplitudes.
We find that the presence of a grain boundary and associated disorder is
responsible for a very large drop in the critical current relative to a clean
system. We also find that when a tunnel barrier is present, grain boundaries
cause substantial variations in the critical currents due to the disordered
hoppings near the tunnel barrier. We discuss the applicability of these results
to Josephson junctions presently intended for use in superconducting

for mitigating frequent blockages in millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) communication networks. However, perfect or nearly
perfect channel state information (CSI) is fundamental in order to achieve
their full potential. Traditionally, an RIS is fully passive without any
baseband processing capabilities, which poses great challenges for CSI
acquisition. Thus, we focus on the hybrid RIS architecture, where a small
portion of RIS elements are active and able to processing the received pilot
signals for estimating the corresponding channel. The channel estimation (CE)
is done by resorting to off-the-grid compressive sensing technique, i.e.,
atomic norm minimization, for exacting channel parameters through two stages.
Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the passive RIS CE

By this, we mean that only the knowledge of the matrix A for which the linear

technique, the condition number of the preconditioned operator is bounded
theoretically from above. This upper bound can be made smaller by enriching the

$\rm A_4$ modular invariant theory of flavors with CP invariance. The CP
symmetry of the lepton sector is broken by fixing the modulus $\tau$. Lepton
mass matrices are completely consistent with observed lepton masses and mixing
angles in our model. In this framework, a fixed $\tau$ also causes the CP
violation in the soft SUSY breaking terms. The elecrton EDM arises from the CP
non-conserved soft SUSY breaking terms. The experimental upper bound of the
electron EDM excludes the SUSY mass scale below $2-6$ TeV for five cases of the
lepton mass matrices. In order to see the effect of CP phase of the modulus
$\tau$, we examine the correlation between the electron EDM and the decay rate
of the $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$ decay, which is also predicted by the soft
SUSY breaking terms. The correlations are clearly predicted in contrast to
models of the conventional flavor symmetry. The SUSY mass scale will be
constrained by the future sensitivity of the electron EDM, $|d_e/e| \simeq
10^{-30}$. Indeed, it could probe the SUSY mass range of $10-20$ TeV in our
model. Thus, the electron EDM provides a severe test of the CP violation via
the modulus $\tau$ in the supersymmetric modular invariant theory of flavors.

low-level information which contains rich detail information also has effect on
improving performance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose cross-layer
navigation convolutional neural network for feature fusion. First, the feature
maps extracted by the backbone network are fed into a convolutional long
short-term memory model sequentially from high-level to low-level to perform
feature aggregation. Then, attention mechanisms are used after feature fusion
to extract spatial and channel information while linking the high-level

locate the discriminative regions for the FGVC. In the experiments, three

by the curriculum, as well as their integration with traditional, non-robotics
learning activities that are well established in teachers' practices. This work
investigates the integration of ER into formal mathematics education, through a
quasi-experimental study employing the Thymio robot and Scratch programming to
teach geometry to two classes of 15-year-old students, for a total of 26
participants. Three research questions were addressed: (1) Should an ER-based
theoretical lecture precede, succeed or replace a traditional theoretical
lecture? (2) What is the students' perception of and engagement in the ER-based
lecture and exercises? (3) Do the findings differ according to students' prior
appreciation of mathematics? The results suggest that ER activities are as
valid as traditional ones in helping students grasp the relevant theoretical
concepts. Robotics activities seem particularly beneficial during exercise
sessions: students freely chose to do exercises that included the robot, rated
them as significantly more interesting and useful than their traditional
counterparts, and expressed their interest in introducing ER in other
mathematics lectures. Finally, results were generally consistent between the
students that like and did not like mathematics, suggesting the use of robotics
as a means to broaden the number of students engaged in the discipline.

detectors, relying mostly on charged current interactions, are mostly sensitive
to $\bar{\nu}_e$ and to a lesser extent to $\nu_e$. In order to measure the
flux of other flavors
($\nu_{\mu},\bar{\nu}_{\mu},\nu_{\tau},\text{and}~\bar{\nu}_{\tau}$), we need
to observe their neutral current interactions with the detector. Such a
measurement is not only crucial for overall normalization of the supernova
neutrino flux but also for understanding the intricate neutrino oscillation
physics. A deuterium based detector will be sensitive to all neutrino flavors.
In this paper, we propose a 1 kton deuterated liquid scintillator (DLS) based
detector that will see about 435 neutral current events and 170 (108) charged
current $\nu_e$ ($\bar{\nu}_e$) events from a fiducial supernova at a distance
of 10 kpc from Earth. We explore the possibility of extracting spectral
information from the neutral current channel
$\overset{\scriptscriptstyle(-)}{\nu} d \rightarrow
\overset{\scriptscriptstyle(-)}{\nu}np$ by measuring the quenched kinetic
energy of the proton in the final state, where the neutron in the final state
is tagged and used to reduce backgrounds. We also discuss the secondary
interactions of the recoil neutrons in the detector.

degeneracy between the strength of the magnetic field perpendicular to the line
of sight (LOS), $B_\perp$, and the cosmic-ray electron (CRe) spectrum.
Depending on the observing frequency, an energy-independent spectral energy
slope $s$ for the CRe spectrum is usually assumed: $s=-2$ at frequencies below
$\simeq$400 MHz and $s=-3$ at higher frequencies. Motivated by the high angular
and spectral resolution of current facilities such as the LOw Frequency ARray
(LOFAR) and future telescopes such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), we aim
to understand the consequences of taking into account the energy-dependent CRe
spectral energy slope on the analysis of the spatial variations of the
brightness temperature spectral index, $\beta$, and on the estimate of the
average value of $B_\perp$ along the LOS. We illustrate analytically and
numerically the impact that different realisations of the CRe spectrum have on
the interpretation of the spatial variation of $\beta$. We find that the common
assumption of an energy-independent $s$ is valid only in special cases. We show
that for typical magnetic field strengths of the diffuse interstellar medium
($\simeq$2$-$20 $\mu$G), at frequencies of 0.1$-$10 GHz, the electrons that are
mainly responsible for the synchrotron emission have energies in the range
$\simeq$100 MeV$-$50 GeV. This is the energy range where the spectral slope,
$s$, of CRe has its greatest variation. We also show that the polarisation
fraction can be much smaller than the maximum value of $\simeq 70\%$ because
the orientation of ${\bf B}_\perp$ varies across the telescope's beam and along
the LOS. Finally, we present a look-up plot that can be used to estimate the
average value of $B_\perp$ along the LOS from a set of values of $\beta$
measured at centimetre to metre wavelengths, for a given CRe spectrum.

Both settings aim to generate target captions with the same transformer-based

multi-input/multi-output (MIMO) switched linear systems (SLSs) from Markov
parameters. In the first stage, a linear time-varying (LTV) realization that is
topologically equivalent to the true SLS is derived from the Markov parameters
assuming that the submodels have a common MacMillan degree and a mild condition
on their dwell times holds. In the second stage, zero sets of LTV Hankel
matrices where the realized system has a linear time-invariant (LTI) pulse
response matching that of the original SLS are exploited to extract the
submodels, up to arbitrary similarity transformations, by a clustering
algorithm using a statistics that is invariant to similarity transformations.
Recovery is shown to be complete if the dwell times are sufficiently long and
some mild identifiability conditions are met. In the third stage, the switching
sequence is estimated by three schemes. The first scheme is based on
forward/backward corrections and works on the short segments. The second scheme
matches Markov parameter estimates to the true parameters for LTV systems and
works on the medium-to-long segments. The third scheme also matches Markov
parameters, but for LTI systems only and works on the very short segments. In
the fourth stage, the submodels estimated in Stage 2 are brought to a common
basis by applying a novel basis transformation method which is necessary before
performing output predictions to given inputs. A numerical example illustrates
the properties of the realization algorithm. A key role in this algorithm is
played by time-dependent switching sequences that partition the state-space
according to time, unlike many other works in the literature in which
partitioning is state and/or input dependent.

generative models. Both generative models are trained using the classifier to
explain and a database to enforce the following properties: (i) All images
generated by the first generator are classified similarly to the input image,
whereas the second generator's outputs are classified oppositely. (ii)
Generated images belong to the distribution of real images. (iii) The distances
between the input image and the corresponding generated images are minimal so
that the difference between the generated elements only reveals relevant
information for the studied classifier. Using symmetrical and cyclic
constraints, we present two different approximations and implementations of the
general formulation. Experimentally, we demonstrate significant improvements
w.r.t the state-of-the-art on three different public data sets. In particular,
the localization of regions influencing the classifier is consistent with human
annotations.

fixed effects (FE) models to assess the impact of mitigation policies on health
outcomes. Building on the SIRD model of disease transmission, I show that FE
models tend to be misspecified for three reasons. First, despite misleading
common trends in the pre-treatment period, the parallel trends assumption
generally does not hold. Second, heterogeneity in infection rates and infected
populations across regions cannot be accounted for by region-specific fixed
effects, nor by conditioning on observable time-varying confounders. Third,
epidemiological theory predicts heterogeneous treatment effects across regions
and over time. Via simulations, I find that the bias resulting from model
misspecification can be substantial, in magnitude and sometimes in sign.
Overall, my results caution against the use of FE models for mitigation policy

three terms (specifically, a second-order polynomial), and not a simple
single-order reaction (i.e. 0th, 1st, or 2nd-order reaction). We demonstrate
how computer-derived results can aid the researcher to develop profound

colonies. They initially grow two-dimensionally on a surface and finally
achieve three-dimensional growth. While it was recently reported that
three-dimensional growth is promoted by topological defects of winding number
$+1/2$ in populations of motile bacteria, how cellular alignment plays a role
in non-motile cases is largely unknown. Here, we investigate the relevance of
topological defects in colony formation processes of non-motile E. coli
populations, and found that both $\pm 1/2$ topological defects contribute to
the three-dimensional growth. Analyzing the cell flow in the bottom layer of
the colony, we observe that $+1/2$ defects attract cells and $-1/2$ defects
repel cells, in agreement with previous studies on motile cells, in the initial
stage of the colony growth. However, later, cells gradually flow toward $-1/2$
defects as well, exhibiting a sharp contrast to the existing knowledge. By
investigating three-dimensional cell orientations by confocal microscopy, we
find strong vertical tilting of cells near the defects. Crucially, this leads
to the emergence of a polar order in the otherwise nematic two-dimensional cell
orientation. We extend the theory of active nematics by incorporating this
polar order and the vertical tilting, which successfully explains the influx
toward $-1/2$ defects in terms of a polarity-induced force. Our work reveals
that three-dimensional cell orientations may result in drastic changes in
properties of active nematics, especially those of topological defects, which
may be generically relevant in active matter systems driven by cellular growth
instead of self-propulsion.

users (SUs) into believing that a PU signal is present whereas it is not. Such
an attack is known as the Primary User Emulation Attack (PUEA). A malicious

with objects and surfaces. The dynamics of such changing-contact robot

continuous elsewhere. These discontinuities make it difficult to construct and
use a single dynamics model or control strategy for any such task. We present a
framework for smooth dynamics and control of such changing-contact manipulation
tasks. For any given target motion trajectory, the framework incrementally
improves its prediction of when contacts will occur. This prediction and a
model relating approach velocity to impact force modify the velocity profile of
the motion sequence such that it is $C^\infty$ smooth, and help achieve a
desired force on impact. We implement this framework by building on our hybrid

skin-picking, are hand-driven behaviors which can damage one's appearance, if

under-explored, with few previous works being limited to wearables with single
modalities (e.g., motion). Here, we propose a multi-sensory approach combining
motion, orientation, and heart rate sensors to detect BFRBs. We conducted a
feasibility study in which participants (N=10) were exposed to BFRBs-inducing
tasks, and analyzed 380 mins of signals under an extensive evaluation of
sensing modalities, cross-validation methods, and observation windows. Our
models achieved an AUC > 0.90 in distinguishing BFRBs, which were more evident
in observation windows 5 mins prior to the behavior as opposed to 1-min ones.
In a follow-up qualitative survey, we found that not only the timing of
detection matters but also models need to be context-aware, when designing
just-in-time interventions to prevent BFRBs.

over centralized exchanges: users control their funds and avoid the risk of an
exchange hack or malicious operator. However, because user assets are fully
accessible by a secret key, decentralized exchanges pose significant internal
security risks for trading firms and automated trading systems, where a
compromised system can result in total loss of funds. Centralized exchanges
mitigate this risk through API key based security policies that allow
professional users to give individual traders or automated systems specific and
customizable access rights such as trading or withdrawal limits. Such policies,
however, are not compatible with decentralized exchanges, where all exchange
operations require a signature generated by the owner's secret key. This paper
introduces a protocol based upon multiparty computation that allows for the
creation of API keys and security policies that can be applied to any existing
decentralized exchange. Our protocol works with both ECDSA and EdDSA signature
schemes and prioritizes efficient computation and communication. We have
deployed this protocol on Nash exchange, as well as around several

community proposed several approaches to make the learning procedure of Neural
Networks more effective. When focussing on the way in which the training data
are provided to the learning machine, we can distinguish between the classic
random selection of stochastic gradient-based optimization and more involved
techniques that devise curricula to organize data, and progressively increase
the complexity of the training set. In this paper, we propose a novel training
procedure named Friendly Training that, differently from the aforementioned
approaches, involves altering the training examples in order to help the model
to better fulfil its learning criterion. The model is allowed to simplify those
examples that are too hard to be classified at a certain stage of the training
procedure. The data transformation is controlled by a developmental plan that
progressively reduces its impact during training, until it completely vanishes.
In a sense, this is the opposite of what is commonly done in order to increase
robustness against adversarial examples, i.e., Adversarial Training.
Experiments on multiple datasets are provided, showing that Friendly Training
yields improvements with respect to informed data sub-selection routines and
random selection, especially in deep convolutional architectures. Results
suggest that adapting the input data is a feasible way to stabilize learning
and improve the generalization skills of the network.

examine the effectiveness of NGD and its variants for overcoming the vanishing

was conducted on examining the learned knowledge of fine-tuned model and

been challenging due to the tension between instrument throughput and
stability. Light from the telescope can either be injected wholesale into the
instrument, maintaining high throughput at the cost of point-spread function
(PSF) stability, or the time-varying components of the light can be filtered
out with single-mode fibers (SMFs), maintaining instrument stability at the
cost of light loss. Today, the field of astrophotonics provides a potential
resolution to the throughput-stability tension in the form of the photonic
lantern (PL): a tapered waveguide which can couple a time-varying and aberrated
PSF into multiple diffraction-limited beams at an efficiency that greatly
surpasses direct SMF injection. As a result, lantern-fed instruments retain the
stability of SMF-fed instruments while increasing their throughput. To this
end, we present a series of numerical simulations characterizing PL performance
as a function of lantern geometry, wavelength, and wavefront error (WFE), aimed
at guiding the design of future diffraction-limited spectrometers. These
characterizations include a first look at the interaction between PLs and

by setting the coefficients of the Bernstein basis. Moreover, we can learn the

titled ``Diagnostics of COVID-19 using Acoustics (DiCOVA) Challenge''. The goal
was to bring together researchers and practitioners interested in developing
acoustics-based COVID-19 POCTs by enabling them to work on the same set of
development and test datasets. As part of the challenge, datasets with
breathing, cough, and speech sound samples from COVID-19 and non-COVID-19
individuals were released to the participants. The challenge consisted of two
tracks. The Track-1 focused only on cough sounds, and participants competed in
a leaderboard setting. In Track-2, breathing and speech samples were provided
for the participants, without a competitive leaderboard. The challenge
attracted 85 plus registrations with 29 final submissions for Track-1. This
paper describes the challenge (datasets, tasks, baseline system), and presents
a focused summary of the various systems submitted by the participating teams.

results are mixed. Based on Bayesian multi-level regression modeling, (i) there
indeed is an effect between online disinformation and offline protests, but the

clearer in a sample of countries belonging to the European Economic Area. With
this sample, (ii) offline protest counts increase from online disinformation
disseminated by domestic governments, political parties, and politicians as

sunk-cost bias in a stochastic environment. Agents exhibiting sunk-cost bias
take into account the effort they have already spent on an endeavor when they
evaluate whether to continue or abandon it. We model planning tasks in which an
agent with this type of bias tries to reach a designated goal. Our model
structures this problem as a type of Markov decision process: loosely speaking,
the agent traverses a directed acyclic graph with probabilistic transitions,
paying costs for its actions as it tries to reach a target node containing a
specified reward. The agent's sunk cost bias is modeled by a cost that it
incurs for abandoning the traversal: if the agent decides to stop traversing
the graph, it incurs a cost of $\lambda \cdot C_{sunk}$, where ${\lambda \geq
0}$ is a parameter that captures the extent of the bias and $C_{sunk}$ is the
sum of costs already invested.
  We analyze the behavior of two types of agents: naive agents that are unaware
of their bias, and sophisticated agents that are aware of it. Since optimal
(bias-free) behavior in this problem can involve abandoning the traversal
before reaching the goal, the bias exhibited by these types of agents can
result in sub-optimal behavior by shifting their decisions about abandonment.
We show that in contrast to optimal agents, it is computationally hard to
compute the optimal policy for a sophisticated agent. Our main results quantify
the loss exhibited by these two types of agents with respect to an optimal
agent. We present both general and topology-specific bounds.

process in which its viscosity increases due to the formation of internal
structure, which is represented by a Coussot-type relationship. The resultant
flow dynamics is the consequence of the competition between structuration and
destructuration, as characterized by the dimensionless timescale for
structuration (tau) and the dimensionless material property (beta) of the
bottom fluid. The development of Kelvin-Helmholtz type instabilities (roll-up
structures) observed in the Newtonian constant viscosity case was found to be
suppressed as the viscosity of the bottom layer increased over time. It is
found that, for the set of parameters considered in the present study, the
bottom layer almost behaves like a Newtonian fluid with constant viscosity for
tau greater than 10 and beta greater than 1. It is also shown that decreasing
the value of the Froude number stabilizes the interfacial instabilities. The

an exact characterization of the capacity-achieving input distribution for

paper, we consider four different channel models with multi-bit phase
quantization at the output and identify the optimal input distribution for each
channel model. We first consider a complex Gaussian channel with $b$-bit
phase-quantized output and prove that the capacity-achieving distribution is a
rotated $2^b$-phase shift keying (PSK). The analysis is then extended to
multiple fading scenarios. We show that the optimality of rotated $2^b$-PSK
continues to hold under noncoherent fast fading Rician channels with $b$-bit
phase quantization when line-of-sight (LoS) is present. When channel state
information (CSI) is available at the receiver, we identify
$\frac{2\pi}{2^b}$-symmetry and constant amplitude as the necessary and
sufficient conditions for the ergodic capacity-achieving input distribution;
which a $2^b$-PSK satisfies. Finally, an optimum power control scheme is

flexible ensemble learning and semiparametric efficiency theory in a two-step

We focuson the estimation of intervention-specific mean outcomes with
stochastic interventions on a time-fixed treatment. For data-adaptive
estimation of nuisance parameters, we propose a new flexible highly adaptive
lasso estimation method for continuous-time intensities that can be implemented
with L1-penalized Poisson regression. In a simulation study the targeted
maximum likelihood estimator based on the highly adaptive lasso estimator
proves to be unbiased and achieve proper coverage in agreement with the
asymptotic theory and further displays efficiency improvements relative to a

correlations between the language and video features due to the selection bias

propose a novel paradigm from the perspective of the causal inference, i.e.,
interventional video grounding (IVG) that leverages backdoor adjustment to
deconfound the selection bias based on structured causal model (SCM) and
do-calculus P(Y|do(X)). Then, we present a simple yet effective method to
approximate the unobserved confounder as it cannot be directly sampled from the

to better align the text and video by maximizing the mutual information (MI)
between query and video clips, and the MI between start/end frames of a target

aiding compactness, this approach offers superior performance, leading to
sharper spectroscopy peaks and stronger absorption signals. Doppler-free

full, 2D parameter space associated with dual-frequency spectroscopy, we reveal
a lattice-like structure of sharp resonance features in 2D frequency space,
which enhances experimental versatility by allowing laser frequency
stabilisation anywhere within a wide manifold of locations in 2D frequency

analysed in detail, revealing that it can be expected to produce significant
improvements in laser stability when compared to conventional, single-frequency

have been consistently revealed more accurate Lagrangian particle motions. A
novel track initialisation technique as a complementary part of 4D-PTV, based
on local temporal and spatial coherency of neighbour trajectories, is proposed.
The proposed Lagrangian Coherent Track Initialisation (LCTI) applies
physics-based Finite Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE) to build four frame coherent
tracks. We locally determine the boundaries (i.e., ridges) of Lagrangian
Coherent Structures (LCS) among neighbour trajectories by using FTLE to
distinguish clusters of coherent motions. To evaluate the proposed technique,
we created an open-access synthetic Lagrangian and Eulerian dataset of the wake
downstream of a smooth cylinder at a Reynolds number equal to 3900 obtained
from 3D Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). The dataset is available to the
public. Performance of the proposed method based on three characteristic
parameters, temporal scale, particle concentration (i.e., density), and noise
ratio, showed robust behaviour in finding true tracks compared to the recent
initialisation algorithms. Sensitivity of LCTI to the number of untracked and
wrong tracks are also discussed. We address the capability of using the
proposed method as a function of a 4D-PTV scheme in the Lagrangian Particle
Tracking challenge for a flow with high particle densities. Finally, the LCTI
behaviour was assessed in a real jet impingement experiment. LCTI was found to
be a reliable tracking tool in complex flow motions, with a strength revealed
for flows with high particle concentrations.

systematic approach to obtain analogs of natural language in vision, such as

representations of each modality. We name this problem Modality Failure, and
hypothesize that the imbalance of modalities and the implicit bias of common
objectives in fusion method prevent encoders of each modality from sufficient
feature learning. To this end, we propose a new multi-modal learning method,
Uni-Modal Teacher, which combines the fusion objective and uni-modal
distillation to tackle the modality failure problem. We show that our method
not only drastically improves the representation of each modality, but also
improves the overall multi-modal task performance. Our method can be
effectively generalized to most multi-modal fusion approaches. We achieve more

Theoretically, two different contributions are discussed: an electromagnetic

excitations; and the so-called chemical effect originating from the locally
modified electronic structure of the molecule due to the close proximity of the
plasmonic system. Most of the theoretical efforts have concentrated on the
electromagnetic contribution or the chemical effect in case of non-resonant
excitation. In this work, we present a fully quantum mechanical description
including non-resonant and resonant chemical contributions as well as
charge-transfer phenomena of these molecular-plasmonic hybrid system at the
density functional and the time-dependent density functional level of theory.
We consider a surface-immobilized tin(II) phthalocyanine molecule as the
molecular system, which is minutely scanned by a plasmonic tip, modeled by a
single silver atom. These different relative positions of the Ag atom to the
molecule lead to pronounced alterations of the Raman spectra. These Raman
spectra vary substantially, both in peak positions and several orders of
magnitude in the intensity patterns under non-resonant and resonant conditions,
and also, depending on, which electronic states are addressed. Our
computational approach reveals that unique - non-resonant and resonant -
chemical interactions among the tip and the molecule significantly alter the
TERS spectra and are mainly responsible for the high, possibly sub-Angstrom
spatial resolution.

functions have been proposed \textit{ad-hoc} in the literature since the

desirable to emulate the notion of quantile function for univariate probability

introduced in \cite{IRW}, modified in order to satisfy the property of
\textit{affine-invariance}, fulfilling thus all the four key axioms listed in
the nomenclature elaborated by \cite{ZuoS00a}. The variant we propose, referred

the directions along which $X$ is most variable to assign a depth value to any

result for the statistical counterpart of the AI-IRW depth is proved. Beyond

boundary and let $G$ be a Lie group equipped with a bi-invariant
pseudo-Riemannian metric. The moduli space of flat principal $G$-bundles over
$\Sigma$ which are trivialized at a finite subset of $\partial\Sigma$ carries a
natural quasi-Hamiltonian structure which was introduced by Li-Bland and
Severa. By a suitable restriction of the holonomy over $\partial \Sigma$ and of
the gauge action, which is called a decoration of $\partial \Sigma$, it is
possible to obtain a number of interesting Poisson structures as subquotients
of this family of quasi-Hamiltonian structures. In this work we use this
quasi-Hamiltonian structure to construct Poisson and symplectic groupoids in a
systematic fashion by means of two observations: (1) gluing two copies of the
same decorated surface along suitable subspaces of their boundaries determines
a groupoid structure on the moduli space associated to the new surface, this
procedure can be iterated by gluing four copies of the same surface, thereby
inducing a double Poisson groupoid structure; (2) on the other hand, we can
suppose that $G$ is a Lie 2-group, then the groupoid structure on $G$ descends
to a groupoid structure on the moduli space of flat $G$-bundles over $\Sigma$.
These two observations can be combined to produce up to three distinct and
compatible groupoid structures on the associated moduli spaces. We illustrate
these methods by considering symplectic groupoids over Bruhat cells, twisted
moduli spaces and Poisson 2-groups besides the classical examples.

AGN with moderate-to-high X-ray luminosity, which are twice as likely to be
hosted by star-forming galaxies than by quiescent ones. The distribution of the
specific Black Hole accretion rate (sBHAR, $\lambda_{\mathrm{sBHAR}}$) shows
that nuclear activity in local, non-AGN dominated galaxies peaks at very low
accretion rates ($-4 \lesssim \log\lambda_{\mathrm{sBHAR}} \lesssim -3$) in all

increase of the mean $\lambda_{\mathrm{sBHAR}}$ with SFR for both star-forming

demonstration it was able to reach human performance on video game benchmarks
using deep Q-learning (DQN). The current consensus for training neural networks
on such complex environments is to rely on gradient-based optimization.
Although alternative Bayesian deep learning methods exist, most of them still
rely on gradient-based optimization, and they typically do not scale on
benchmarks such as the Atari game environment. Moreover none of these
approaches allow performing the analytical inference for the weights and biases
defining the neural network. In this paper, we present how we can adapt the
temporal difference Q-learning framework to make it compatible with the
tractable approximate Gaussian inference (TAGI), which allows learning the
parameters of a neural network using a closed-form analytical method.
Throughout the experiments with on- and off-policy reinforcement learning
approaches, we demonstrate that TAGI can reach a performance comparable to
backpropagation-trained networks while using fewer hyperparameters, and without
relying on gradient-based optimization.

precession if the disc is tilted with respect to the black hole spin vector.
When the disc viscosity is sufficiently large that warp propagation is
diffusive, the inner disc can align with the black hole spin. However, if the
viscosity is small, such that the warp propagates as a wave, then steady-state
solutions to the linearised fluid equations exhibit an oscillatory radial
profile of the disc tilt angle close to the black hole. Here we show, for the
first time, that these solutions are in good agreement with three-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations, in which the viscosity is isotropic and measured to
be small compared to the disc angular semi-thickness, and in the case that the
disc tilt -- and thus the warp amplitude -- remains small. We show using both
the linearised fluid equations and hydrodynamical simulations that the inner
disc tilt can be more than several times larger than the original disc tilt,
and we provide physical reasoning for this effect. We explore the transition in
disc behaviour as the misalignment angle is increased, finding increased
dissipation associated with regions of strong warping. For large enough
misalignments the disc becomes unstable to disc tearing and breaks into
discrete planes. For the simulations we present here, we show that the total
(physical and numerical) viscosity at the time the disc breaks is small enough
that the disc tearing occurs in the wave-like regime, substantiating that disc
tearing is possible in this region of parameter space. Our simulations
demonstrate that high spatial resolution, and thus low numerical viscosity, is
required to accurately model the warp dynamics in this regime. Finally, we
discuss the observational implications of our results.

spatially resolved measurement of the Josephson critical current $I_c$ between
a tip and a superconducting sample, a nearly direct measurement of the true
superconducting order parameter. However, it is unclear how these $I_c$
measurements are correlated with previous estimates of the spectral gap taken
from differential conductance measurements. In particular, recent such
experiments on an iron-based superconductor found almost no correlation between
$I_c$ and the spectral gap obtained from differential conductance $g=dI/dV$
spectra, reporting instead a more significant correlation between $I_c$ and the
the coherence-peak height. Here we point out that the correlation--or the lack
thereof--between these various quantities can be naturally explained by the
effect of disorder on unconventional superconductivity. Using large scale
numerical simulations of a BCS $d$-wave pair Hamiltonian with many-impurity
potentials, we observe that ""substitutional"" disorder models with weak
pointlike impurities lead to a situation in which the true superconducting
order parameter and $I_c$ are both uncorrelated with the spectral gap from
$dI/dV$ measurements and highly correlated with the coherence-peak heights. The
underlying mechanism appears to be the disorder-induced transfer of spectral
weight away from the coherence peaks. On the other hand, smooth impurity
potentials with a length scale larger than the lattice constant lead to a large
positive correlation between the true superconducting order parameter and the
spectral gap, in addition to a large correlation between the order parameter
and the coherence-peak height. We discuss the applicability of our results to
recent Josephson scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments on iron-based and

wireless communication systems have recently received much attention. Among the
different use cases, the most popular one is where each element of the RIS
scatters the incoming signal with a controllable phase-shift, without
increasing its power. In prior literature, this setup has been analyzed by
neglecting the electromagnetic interference, consisting of the inevitable
incoming waves from external sources. In this letter, we provide a physically
meaningful model for the electromagnetic interference that can be used as a
baseline when evaluating RIS-aided communications. The model is used to show
that electromagnetic interference has a non-negligible impact on communication
performance, especially when the size of the RIS grows large. When the direct
link is present (though with a relatively weak gain), the RIS can even reduce
the communication performance. Importantly, it turns out that the SNR grows
quadratically with the number of RIS elements only when the spatial correlation
matrix of the electromagnetic interference is asymptotically orthogonal to that

  a volume limited sample of white dwarfs","Accepted by MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/stab2046",,"astro-ph.SR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Many stars evolve into magnetic white dwarfs, and observations may help to
understand when the magnetic field appears at the stellar surface, if and how
it evolves during the cooling phase, and what are the mechanisms that generate
it. After obtaining new spectropolarimetric observations and combining them
with previous literature data, we have checked the population of about 152
white dwarfs within 20 pc from the Sun for the presence of magnetic fields,
with a sensitivity that ranges from better than 1 kG for most of the stars of
spectral class DA, to 1 MG for some of the featureless white dwarfs. We find
that 33 white dwarfs of the local 20 pc volume are magnetic. Statistically the
data are consistent with the possibility that the frequency of the magnetic
field occurrence is similar in stars of all spectral classes, except that in
the local 20 pc volume, either DQ stars are more frequently magnetic, or host
much stronger fields than average. The distribution of the observed field
strength ranges from 40 kG to 300 MG and is uniform per decade, in striking
contrast to the field frequency distribution resulting from spectroscopic
surveys. No fields weaker than 40 kG are found. We confirm that magnetic fields
are more frequent in white dwarfs with higher than average mass. We find a
marked deficiency of magnetic white dwarfs younger than 0.5 Gyr, and that the
frequency of the occurrence of the magnetic field is significantly higher in
white dwarfs that have undergone the process of core crystallisation than in
white dwarfs with fully liquid core. There is no obvious evidence of field
strength decay with time. We discuss the implications of our findings in
relation to some of the proposals that have been put forward to explain the
origin and evolution of magnetic fields in degenerate stars, in particular
those that predict the presence of a dynamo acting during the crystallisation
phase.

It can be applied in particular to infinitary Lawvere theories, generalizing
the well-known case of finitary Lawvere theories. We also look at a large limit

However, most beam steering OWC technologies require high-accuracy positioning

methods are probably the most popular approach in uncertainty quantification to
computing expected values of quantities of interest (QoIs). Multilevel Monte
Carlo (MLMC) methods significantly reduce the computational cost by
distributing the sampling across a hierarchy of discretizations and allocating
most samples to the coarser grids. For time dependent problems, spatial
coarsening typically entails an increased time-step. Geometric constraints,
however, may impede uniform coarsening thereby forcing some elements to remain
small across all levels. If explicit time-stepping is used, the time-step will
then be dictated by the smallest element on each level for numerical stability.
Hence, the increasingly stringent CFL condition on the time-step on coarser
levels significantly reduces the advantages of the multilevel approach. To
overcome that bottleneck we propose to combine the multilevel approach of MLMC
with local time-stepping (LTS). By adapting the time-step to the locally
refined elements on each level, the efficiency of MLMC methods is restored even
in the presence of complex geometry without sacrificing the explicitness and
inherent parallelism. In a careful cost comparison, we quantify the reduction
in computational cost for local refinement either inside a small fixed region
or towards a reentrant corner.

safety. However, it is unrealistic to elaborately label instances of all
scenarios and circumstances (i.e., night, extreme weather, cities) when

self-supervised and semi-supervised learning, a promising direction is to learn
a robust detection model by collaboratively exploiting large-scale unlabeled
data and few labeled data. Existing datasets either provide only a small amount
of data or covers limited domains with full annotation, hindering the
exploration of large-scale pre-trained models. Here, we release a Large-Scale
2D Self/semi-supervised Object Detection dataset for Autonomous driving, named
as SODA10M, containing 10 million unlabeled images and 20K images labeled with
6 representative object categories. To improve diversity, the images are
collected within 27833 driving hours under different weather conditions,
periods and location scenes of 32 different cities. We provide extensive

approaches, and give some interesting findings in autonomous driving scope.
Experiments show that SODA10M can serve as a promising pre-training dataset for

infection numbers. Frequent large-scale rapid testing should remain part of
strategies to contain CoViD-19; it can substitute for many non-pharmaceutical
interventions that come at a much larger cost to individuals, society, and the

tasks with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, most existing GNNs are based
on the assumption that node samples for different classes are balanced, while
for many real-world graphs, there exists the problem of class imbalance, i.e.,
some classes may have much fewer samples than others. In this case, directly
training a GNN classifier with raw data would under-represent samples from
those minority classes and result in sub-optimal performance. This paper
presents GraphMixup, a novel mixup-based framework for improving
class-imbalanced node classification on graphs. However, directly performing
mixup in the input space or embedding space may produce out-of-domain samples
due to the extreme sparsity of minority classes; hence we construct semantic
relation spaces that allows the Feature Mixup to be performed at the semantic
level. Moreover, we apply two context-based self-supervised techniques to
capture both local and global information in the graph structure and then
propose Edge Mixup specifically for graph data. Finally, we develop a
\emph{Reinforcement Mixup} mechanism to adaptively determine how many samples
are to be generated by mixup for those minority classes. Extensive experiments
on three real-world datasets show that GraphMixup yields truly encouraging
results for class-imbalanced node classification tasks.

together with the nature of the distribution should characterize a LAFE. In
practice however, it is generally characterized by an effective field
enhancement factor obtained from a linear fit to a Fowler-Nordheim plot of the

observation that for a dense packing of emitters, shielding is large and LAFE
emission occurs largely from the periphery, while well separated emitter tips
show a more uniform or 2-dimensional emission. This observation naturally leads
to the question of the existence of an emission-dimension, $D_e$ for
characterizing LAFEs. We show here that the number of patches of size $L_P$ in
the ON-state (above average emission) scales as $N(L_P) \sim L_P^{-D_e}$ in a

problem of classifying the possible images of $\ell$-adic Galois

equivalently, classifying the rational points on the corresponding modular
curves. The primes $\ell=2$ and $\ell\ge 13$ are addressed by prior work, so we
focus on the remaining primes $\ell = 3, 5, 7, 11$. For each of these $\ell$,
we compute the directed graph of arithmetically maximal $\ell$-power level
modular curves $X_H$, compute explicit equations for all but three of them, and
classify the rational points on all of them except $X_{{\rm ns}}^{+}(N)$, for
$N = 27, 25, 49, 121$, and two level $49$ curves of genus $9$ whose Jacobians
have analytic rank $9$.
  Aside from the $\ell$-adic images that are known to arise for infinitely many
$\bar{\mathbb{Q}}$-isomorphism classes of elliptic curves $E/\mathbb{Q}$, we
find only 22 exceptional images that arise for any prime $\ell$ and any
$E/\mathbb{Q}$ without complex multiplication; these exceptional images are
realized by 20 non-CM rational $j$-invariants. We conjecture that this list of
22 exceptional images is complete and show that any counterexamples must arise
from unexpected rational points on $X_{\rm ns}^+(\ell)$ with $\ell\ge 19$, or
one of the six modular curves noted above. This yields a very efficient
algorithm to compute the $\ell$-adic images of Galois for any elliptic curve
over $\mathbb{Q}$.

abelian varieties attached to newforms on $\Gamma_1(N)$ are of ${\rm

informative facial components from unaligned facial images regardless of head
pose and non-rigid deformation. To this end, we design a face parsing-based

semi-automatically cleaning the noisy IMDB-WIKI dataset using a constrained

  For these classes of polynomials, we study the $(d-1)$-dimensional volume

Neural Network (RNN) to capture long-range temporal structure. However, RNN
suffers from non-parallelism and gradient vanishing, hence it is hard to be
optimized. In this paper, we propose a new encoder-decoder framework based on
Transformers, named OadTR, to tackle these problems. The encoder attached with
a task token aims to capture the relationships and global interactions between
historical observations. The decoder extracts auxiliary information by
aggregating anticipated future clip representations. Therefore, OadTR can
recognize current actions by encoding historical information and predicting
future context simultaneously. We extensively evaluate the proposed OadTR on
three challenging datasets: HDD, TVSeries, and THUMOS14. The experimental
results show that OadTR achieves higher training and inference speeds than
current RNN based approaches, and significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods in terms of both mAP and mcAP. Code is available at

mixing (KM) portal, it necessitates the existence of portal matter (PM)
particles which carry both dark and SM quantum numbers that will appear in
vacuum polarization-like loop graphs. In addition to the familiar $\sim
e\epsilon Q$ strength, QED-like interaction for the dark photon (DP), in some
setups different loop graphs of these PM states can also induce other coupling
structures for the SM fermions that may come to dominate in at least some
regions of parameter space regions and which can take the form of `dark'
moments, \eg, magnetic dipole-type interactions in the IR, associated with a
large mass scale, $\Lambda$. In this paper, motivated by a simple toy model, we
perform a phenomenological investigation of a possible loop-induced dark
magnetic dipole moment for SM fermions, in particular, for the electron. We
show that at the phenomenological level such a scenario can not only be made
compatible with existing experimental constraints for a significant range of
correlated values for $\Lambda$ and the dark $U(1)_D$ gauge coupling, $g_D$,
but can also lead to quantitatively different signatures once the DP is
discovered. In this setup, assuming complex scalar DM to satisfy CMB
constraints, parameter space regions where the DP decays invisibly are found to
be somewhat preferred if PM mass limits from direct searches at the LHC and our
toy model setup are all taken seriously. High precision searches for, or
measurements of, the $e^+e^- \to \gamma +{\rm DP}$ process at Belle II are
shown to provide some of the strongest future constraints on this scenario.

been proposed by the author. The proposal requires that one starts off with the
entire Penrose diagram for the eternal black hole as the background metric,
after which a procedure was proposed to identify the two asymptotic domains of
this metric, such that they both refer to the same outside world. In this paper
we focus on the need to include time reversal in applying this identification.
This forces us to postulate the existence of an 'anti-vacuum' state in our
world, which is the state where energy density reaches a maximal value. We find
that this squares well with the deterministic interpretation of quantum
mechanics, according to which quantum Hilbert space is to be regarded as the
'vector representation' of a real world.
  One has to understand how to deal with gravity in such considerations. The
non-perturbative component of the gravitational force seems to involve
cut-and-paste procedures as dynamical features of space and time, of which the
re-arrangement of space-time into two connected domains in the Penrose diagram
is a primary example. Thus we attempt to obtain new insights in the nature of
particle interactions at the Planck scale, as well as quantum mechanics itself.
  In this newer version of the paper an important correction is made concerning
the antipodal transformation: applying more insight in the situation, as
explained in newer publications by the author, we now regard region II of the
Penrose diagram as an exact quantum copy of region I , still with time being
reversed, but interchanging a region of spacetime with its antipodes is now
seen to be incorrect.

successful single-agent behaviors as a precursor to learning multi-agent

heavily on, the exchange of implicit signals.

  Three annotators label the corpus with a series of conceptual credibility
criteria, reaching an agreement of 0.82 (Fleiss' Kappa). We present preliminary

The ever increasing use of neural networks as surrogates for physics-related

and its influence on the network accuracy. In this paper, several strategies to
impose boundary conditions (namely padding, improved spatial context, and
explicit encoding of physical boundaries) are investigated in the context of
fully convolutional networks applied to recurrent tasks. These strategies are
evaluated on two spatio-temporal evolving problems modeled by partial
differential equations: the 2D propagation of acoustic waves (hyperbolic PDE)
and the heat equation (parabolic PDE). Results reveal a high sensitivity of
both accuracy and stability on the boundary implementation in such recurrent
tasks. It is then demonstrated that the choice of the optimal padding strategy
is directly linked to the data semantics. Furthermore, the inclusion of
additional input spatial context or explicit physics-based rules allows a
better handling of boundaries in particular for large number of recurrences,
resulting in more robust and stable neural networks, while facilitating the
design and versatility of such networks.

importance to various location-based applications such as vehicle navigation,
traffic management, and location-based recommendations. Existing methods
typically represent a trajectory as a sequence of grid cells, road segments or
intention sets. None of them is ideal, as the cell-based representation ignores
the road network structures and the other two are less efficient in analyzing
city-scale road networks. Moreover, previous models barely leverage spatial
dependencies or only consider them at the grid cell level, ignoring the
non-Euclidean spatial structure shaped by irregular road networks. To address
these problems, we propose a network-based vehicle trajectory prediction model
named NetTraj, which represents each trajectory as a sequence of intersections
and associated movement directions, and then feeds them into a LSTM
encoder-decoder network for future trajectory generation. Furthermore, we
introduce a local graph attention mechanism to capture network-level spatial
dependencies of trajectories, and a temporal attention mechanism with a sliding
context window to capture both short- and long-term temporal dependencies in
trajectory data. Extensive experiments based on two real-world large-scale taxi
trajectory datasets show that NetTraj outperforms the existing state-of-the-art
methods for vehicle trajectory prediction, validating the effectiveness of the
proposed trajectory representation method and spatiotemporal attention
mechanisms.

each node computes the way the tree expands.

society, economy, and public security. Although numerous studies are conducted
for the automatic detection of fake news, the majority tend to utilize deep
neural networks to learn event-specific features for superior detection
performance on specific datasets. However, the trained models heavily rely on
the training datasets and are infeasible to apply to upcoming events due to the
discrepancy between event distributions. Inspired by domain adaptation
theories, we propose an end-to-end adversarial adaptation network, dubbed as
MetaDetector, to transfer meta knowledge (event-shared features) between
different events. Specifically, MetaDetector pushes the feature extractor and
event discriminator to eliminate event-specific features and preserve required
event-shared features by adversarial training. Furthermore, the pseudo-event
discriminator is utilized to evaluate the importance of historical event posts
to obtain partial shared features that are discriminative for detecting fake
news. Under the coordinated optimization among the four submodules,
MetaDetector accurately transfers the meta-knowledge of historical events to
the upcoming event for fact checking. We conduct extensive experiments on two
large-scale datasets collected from Weibo and Twitter. The experimental results
demonstrate that MetaDetector outperforms the state-of-the-art methods,
especially when the distribution shift between events is significant.
Furthermore, we find that MetaDetector is able to learn the event-shared
features, and alleviate the negative transfer caused by the large distribution
shift between events.

moving mirrors, we construct their gravity dual by resorting to the AdS/BCFT

evolution of entanglement entropy in various moving mirror models. In doing so,
we mainly focus on three different setups: escaping mirror, which models
constant Hawking radiation emanating from an eternal black hole; kink mirror,
which models an evaporating black hole formed from collapse; and the double
escaping mirror, which models two constantly radiating eternal black holes. In
particular, by computing the holographic entanglement entropy, we show that the
kink mirror gives rise to an ideal Page curve. We also find that an interesting
phase transition arises in the case of the double escaping mirror. Furthermore,
we argue and provide evidence for an interpretation of moving mirrors in terms
of two dimensional Liouville gravity. We also discuss the connection between
quantum energy conditions and the time evolution of holographic entanglement

whose dependence on the hypothesis class appears the minimal possible: The
bound depends solely on the true loss function, independent of any other
candidates in the hypothesis class. To our best knowledge, it is the first
generalization bound of this type in the literature, and we hope our findings

every statistician's toolkit. In R, this is elegantly implemented via lm() and
its related functions. However, the statistical inference output from this
suite of functions is based on the assumption that the model is well specified.
This assumption is often unrealistic and at best satisfied approximately. In
the statistics and econometrics literature, this has long been recognized and a
large body of work provides inference for OLS under more practical assumptions.
This can be seen as model-free inference. In this paper, we introduce our
package maars (""models as approximations"") that aims at bringing research on
model-free inference to R via a comprehensive workflow. The maars package
differs from other packages that also implement variance estimation, such as
sandwich, in three key ways. First, all functions in maars follow a consistent
grammar and return output in tidy format, with minimal deviation from the
typical lm() workflow. Second, maars contains several tools for inference
including empirical, multiplier, residual bootstrap, and subsampling, for easy
comparison. Third, maars is developed with pedagogy in mind. For this, most of
its functions explicitly return the assumptions under which the output is
valid. This key innovation makes maars useful in teaching inference under
misspecification and also a powerful tool for applied researchers. We hope our
default feature of explicitly presenting assumptions will become a de facto
standard for most statistical modeling in R.

as an agent tries to find out the optimal transmit power level and RB to form
the desired PP. With the aid of dueling processes, the learning process can be
enhanced by evaluating the valuable state without considering the effect of
each action at each state. Therefore, DDQN is designed for communication
scenarios with a small-size action-state space, while Dueling DDQN is for a
large-size case. Moreover, to decrease the training time, we reduce the action
space by eliminating invalid actions. To control the interference and guarantee

semantic labels/features in a fusion-free manner, so that it can effectively
achieve the reconstruction objective and the consistency objectives in
different feature spaces. Specifically, the reconstruction objective is
conducted on the low-level features. Two consistency objectives based on
contrastive learning are conducted on the high-level features and the semantic
labels, respectively. They make the high-level features effectively explore the
common semantics and the semantic labels achieve the multi-view clustering. As
a result, the proposed framework can reduce the adverse influence of
view-private information. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art clustering effectiveness.

waves is a widespread phenomenon, generally explained by diffusive shock
acceleration. Such shocks can also amplify upstream magnetic field considerably
beyond simple compression. The complex plasma physics processes involved are
often parameterized by assuming that shocks put some fraction $\epsilon_e$ of
their energy into fast particles, and another fraction $\epsilon_B$ into
magnetic field. Modelers of shocks in supernovae, supernova remnants, and
gamma-ray bursters, among other locations, often assume typical values for
these fractions, presumed to remain constant in time. However, it is rare that
enough properties of a source are independently constrained that values of the
epsilons can be inferred directly. Supernova remnants (SNRs) can provide such
circumstances. Here we summarize results from global fits to spatially
integrated emission in six young SNRs, finding $10^{-4} \le \epsilon_e \le
0.05$ and $0.001 \le \epsilon_B \le 0.1$. These large variations might be put
down to the differing ages and environments of these SNRs, so we conduct a
detailed analysis of a single remnant, that of Kepler's supernova. Both
epsilons can be determined at seven different locations around the shock, and
we find even larger ranges for both epsilons, as well as for their ratio (thus
independent of the shock energy itself). We conclude that unknown factors have
a large influence on the efficiency of both processes. Shock obliquity,
upstream neutral fraction, or other possibilities need to be explored, while
calculations assuming fixed values of the epsilons should be regarded as
provisional.

process continuous streams of opinioned information on the Web. However,
performing lifelong learning is non-trivial for deep neural networks as
continually training of incrementally available information inevitably results
in catastrophic forgetting or interference. In this paper, we propose a novel
iterative network pruning with uncertainty regularization method for lifelong
sentiment classification (IPRLS), which leverages the principles of network
pruning and weight regularization. By performing network pruning with
uncertainty regularization in an iterative manner, IPRLS can adapta single BERT
model to work with continuously arriving data from multiple domains while
avoiding catastrophic forgetting and interference. Specifically, we leverage an
iterative pruning method to remove redundant parameters in large deep networks
so that the freed-up space can then be employed to learn new tasks, tackling
the catastrophic forgetting problem. Instead of keeping the old-tasks fixed
when learning new tasks, we also use an uncertainty regularization based on the
Bayesian online learning framework to constrain the update of old tasks weights
in BERT, which enables positive backward transfer, i.e. learning new tasks
improves performance on past tasks while protecting old knowledge from being
lost. In addition, we propose a task-specific low-dimensional residual function
in parallel to each layer of BERT, which makes IPRLS less prone to losing the
knowledge saved in the base BERT network when learning a new task. Extensive
experiments on 16 popular review corpora demonstrate that the proposed IPRLS
method sig-nificantly outperforms the strong baselines for lifelong sentiment
classification. For reproducibility, we submit the code and data

adiabatic co-expansion. Double ionization ionic products were prepared using
synchrotron radiation and analyzed with coincident mass- and 3D momentum
spectroscopy. Calculations were carried out using ab initio molecular dynamics
to understand the fragmentation within the first 500 fs. Further exploration of
the potential energy surfaces were performed at a DFT level of theory to gain
information on the energetics of the processes. Water was identified as an
efficient nano-droplet stabilizer, and is found to have a significant effect
even at low water content. On the molecular level, the stabilizing role of
water can be related to an increase in the dissociation energy between ammonia
molecules and the water enriched environment at the cluster surface.
Furthermore, our results support the role of ammonium as a charge carrier in
the solution, preferentially bound to surrounding ammonia molecules, which can

reverse process taking place in the mirror neutron stars depend on the sign of
baryon asymmetry in mirror sector. Namely, if it is negative, as predicted by
certain baryogenesis scenarios, then $\bar{n}'-\bar{n}$ transitions create a
core of our antimatter gravitationally trapped in the mirror star interior. The
annihilation of accreted gas on such antimatter cores could explain the origin
$\gamma$-source candidates, with unusual spectrum compatible to
baryon-antibaryon annihilation, recently identified in the Fermi LAT catalog,

temperate, rocky planets around these diminutive stars, we're faced with an
apparent logical contradiction - why don't we see a red dwarf in our sky? To
address this ""Red Sky paradox"", we formulate a Bayesian probability function
concerning the odds of finding oneself around a F/G/K-spectral type (Sun-like)
star. If the development of intelligent life from prebiotic chemistry is a
universally rapid and ensured process, the temporal advantage of red dwarfs
dissolves softening the Red Sky paradox, but exacerbating the classic Fermi
paradox. Otherwise, we find that humanity appears to be a 1-in-100 outlier.
Whilst this could be random chance (resolution I), we outline three other
non-mutually exclusive resolutions (II-IV) that broadly act as filters to
attenuate the suitability of red dwarfs for complex life. Future observations
may be able to provide support for some of these. Notably, if surveys reveal a
paucity temperate rocky planets around the smallest (and most numerous) red
dwarfs then this would support resolution II. As another example, if future
characterization efforts were to find that red dwarf worlds have limited
windows for complex life due to stellar evolution, this would support
resolution III. Solving this paradox would reveal guidance for the targeting of
future remote life sensing experiments and the limits of life in the cosmos.

performance analysis of engineering systems described by expensive-to-evaluate
deterministic computer models with parameters defined as interval variables.
These approaches employ a machine learning based optimization strategy, the
so-called Bayesian optimization, for evaluating the upper and lower bounds of a
generic response variable over the set of possible responses obtained when each
interval variable varies independently over its range. The lack of knowledge
caused by not evaluating the response function for all the possible
combinations of the interval variables is accounted for by developing a
probabilistic description of the response variable itself by using a Gaussian
Process regression model. An iterative procedure is developed for selecting a
small number of simulations to be evaluated for updating this statistical model
by using well-established acquisition functions and to assess the response
bounds. In both approaches, an initial training dataset is defined. While one
approach builds iteratively two distinct training datasets for evaluating
separately the upper and lower bounds of the response variable, the other
builds iteratively a single training dataset. Consequently, the two approaches
will produce different bound estimates at each iteration. The upper and lower
bound responses are expressed as point estimates obtained from the mean
function of the posterior distribution. Moreover, a confidence interval on each
estimate is provided for effectively communicating to engineers when these
estimates are obtained for a combination of the interval variables for which no
deterministic simulation has been run. Finally, two metrics are proposed to
define conditions for assessing if the predicted bound estimates can be
considered satisfactory.

in curvature terms. We have found an approximate analytic black hole solution
in quadratic gravity by keeping only the radial spherically symmetric
fluctuations and dimensionally reducing the 4-dimensional (4D) theory down to
the 2-dimensional (2D) dilaton gravity with a potential. The solution reduces
to the Schwarzschild black hole in the limit of Einstein's gravity, but
otherwise admits non-negative Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) and positive
quasi-local Misner-Sharp masses that can differ significantly. We then study
the thermodynamics of such quantum corrected black holes and compute their
lifetime under Hawking evaporation. We note that for some range of parameters,
black holes increase in mass while emitting Hawking radiation. This
pathological behaviour is related to the negative energy states that are
present in quadratic gravity. We also find that the micro-lensing of
non-Schwarzschild black holes could significantly deviate from the
micro-lensing of their Schwarzschild counterparts. These findings have
important ramifications for the phenomenology of primordial black holes (PBHs)
as dark matter. In particular, the quoted constraints on PBH dark matter from
micro-lensing data can be completely evaded, thus making PBHs in the mass range
$\sim 10^{-12} - 10~M_{\odot}$ viable dark matter candidates.

problem relevant to a number of disciplines and technologies. One difficulty is
that it is ill-defined without setting a criterion for the disorder. Another is
that the density depends on the packing protocol and the multitude of possible
protocol parameters has so far hindered a general solution. A new approach is
proposed here. After formulating a well-posed form of the general
protocol-independent problem for planar packings of discs, a systematic
criterion is proposed to avoid crystalline hexagonal order as well as further
topological order. The highest possible random packing fraction is then derived
exactly: $\phi_{RCP}=0.852525...$. The solution is based on the cell order
distribution that is shown to: (i) yield directly the packing fraction; (ii)
parameterise all possible packing protocols; (iii) make it possible to define
and limit all topological disorder. The method is further useful for predicting
the highest packing fraction in specific protocols, which is illustrated for a
family of simply-sheared packings that generate maximum-entropy cell order
distributions.

  Unfortunately, these methods are often unsuitable for applications that
require an explicit mesh-based surface representation because converting an
implicit field to such a representation relies on the Marching Cubes algorithm,
which cannot be differentiated with respect to the underlying implicit field.

key insight is that by reasoning on how implicit field perturbations impact
local surface geometry, one can ultimately differentiate the 3D location of

this to define DeepMesh - an end-to-end differentiable mesh representation that

of hazards, particularly damaging wind and rainfall. However, $R_{max}$ is
noisy to observe directly and is poorly resolved in reanalyses and climate
models. In contrast, outer wind radii are much less sensitive to such issues.
Here we present a simple empirical model for predicting $R_{max}$ from the
radius of 34-kt wind ($R_{17.5ms}$) that only requires as input quantities that
are routinely estimated operationally: maximum wind speed, $R_{17.5ms}$, and
latitude. The form of the empirical model takes advantage of our physical
understanding of hurricane radial structure and is trained on the Extended Best
Track database from the North Atlantic; results are similar for the TC-OBS
database. The physics reduces the relationship between the two radii to a
dependence on two physical parameters, while the observational data enables an
optimal estimate of the quantitative dependence on those parameters. The model
performs substantially better than existing operational methods for estimating
$R_{max}$. The model reproduces the observed statistical increase in $R_{max}$
with latitude and demonstrates that this increase is driven by the increase in
$R_{17.5ms}$ with latitude. Overall, the model offers a simple and fast
first-order prediction of $R_{max}$ that can be used operationally and in risk
models.

series of practice units that focus on individual dimensions of the skill, such
as hand coordination, correct posture, or correct timing. Ideally, a focus on a
particular practice method should be made in a way to maximize the learner's
progress in learning to play the piano. Because we each learn differently, and
because there are many choices for possible piano practice tasks and methods,
the set of practice tasks should be dynamically adapted to the human learner.
However, having a human teacher guide individual practice is not always
feasible since it is time consuming, expensive, and not always available.
Instead, we suggest to optimize in the space of practice methods, the so-called
practice modes. The proposed optimization process takes into account the skills
of the individual learner and their history of learning. In this work we
present a modeling framework to guide the human learner through the learning
process by choosing practice modes that have the highest expected utility
(i.e., improvement in piano playing skill). To this end, we propose a human
learner utility model based on a Gaussian process, and exemplify the model
training and its application for practice scaffolding on an example of
simulated human learners.

approach to handle the alarm flooding problem faced by Cybersecurity systems
like security information and event management (SIEM) and intrusion detection
(IDS). We apply a zero-shot learning method to machine learning (ML) by
leveraging explanations for predictions of anomalies generated by a ML model.
This approach has huge potential to auto detect alarm labels generated in SIEM
and associate them with specific attack types. In this approach, without any
prior knowledge of attack, we try to identify it, decipher the features that
contribute to classification and try to bucketize the attack in a specific
category - using explainable AI. Explanations give us measurable factors as to
what features influence the prediction of a cyber-attack and to what degree.
These explanations generated based on game-theory are used to allocate credit
to specific features based on their influence on a specific prediction. Using
this allocation of credit, we propose a novel zero-shot approach to categorize
novel attacks into specific new classes based on feature influence. The
resulting system demonstrated will get good at separating attack traffic from
normal flow and auto-generate a label for attacks based on features that
contribute to the attack. These auto-generated labels can be presented to SIEM
analyst and are intuitive enough to figure out the nature of attack. We apply
this approach to a network flow dataset and demonstrate results for specific
attack types like ip sweep, denial of service, remote to local, etc.

estimation in miombo woodlands of Tanzania that utilise the high availability
and low cost of Sentinel-1 data. The limited forest canopy penetration of
C-band SAR sensors along with the sparseness of available ground truth restrict
their usefulness in traditional AGB regression models. Therefore, we propose to
use AGB predictions based on airborne laser scanning (ALS) data as a surrogate
response variable for SAR data. This dramatically increases the available
training data and opens for flexible regression models that capture fine-scale
AGB dynamics. This becomes a sequential modelling approach, where the first
regression stage has linked in situ data to ALS data and produced the AGB
prediction map; We perform the subsequent stage, where this map is related to
Sentinel-1 data. We develop a traditional, parametric regression model and
alternative non-parametric models for this stage. The latter uses a conditional
generative adversarial network (cGAN) to translate Sentinel-1 images into
ALS-based AGB prediction maps. The convolution filters in the neural networks
make them contextual. We compare the sequential models to traditional,
non-sequential regression models, all trained on limited AGB ground reference
data. Results show that our newly proposed non-sequential Sentinel-1-based
regression model performs better quantitatively than the sequential models, but
achieves less sensitivity to fine-scale AGB dynamics. The contextual cGAN-based
sequential models best reproduce the distribution of ALS-based AGB predictions.
They also reach a lower RMSE against in situ AGB data than the parametric
sequential model, indicating a potential for further development.

scene understanding for many applications, such as auto-driving and robotics.
For example, for autonomous cars equipped with RGB cameras and LiDAR, it is
crucial to fuse complementary information from different sensors for robust and
accurate segmentation. Existing fusion-based methods, however, may not achieve
promising performance due to the vast difference between the two modalities. In
this work, we investigate a collaborative fusion scheme called perception-aware
multi-sensor fusion (PMF) to exploit perceptual information from two
modalities, namely, appearance information from RGB images and spatio-depth
information from point clouds. To this end, we first project point clouds to
the camera coordinates to provide spatio-depth information for RGB images.
Then, we propose a two-stream network to extract features from the two
modalities, separately, and fuse the features by effective residual-based
fusion modules. Moreover, we propose additional perception-aware losses to
measure the perceptual difference between the two modalities. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark data sets show the superiority of our method. For
example, on nuScenes, our PMF outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 0.8 in

calculations. We suggest the geometry of our current Universe is better

extend the FLRW model towards the Big Bang and discover a simple explanation of
how matter creation developed into the currently geometrically flat Universe
