  Image Recognition","Accepted by NeurIPS 2021",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vision Transformers (ViT) have achieved remarkable success in large-scale
image recognition. They split every 2D image into a fixed number of patches,
each of which is treated as a token. Generally, representing an image with more
tokens would lead to higher prediction accuracy, while it also results in
drastically increased computational cost. To achieve a decent trade-off between
accuracy and speed, the number of tokens is empirically set to 16x16 or 14x14.
In this paper, we argue that every image has its own characteristics, and
ideally the token number should be conditioned on each individual input. In
fact, we have observed that there exist a considerable number of ""easy"" images
which can be accurately predicted with a mere number of 4x4 tokens, while only
a small fraction of ""hard"" ones need a finer representation. Inspired by this
phenomenon, we propose a Dynamic Transformer to automatically configure a
proper number of tokens for each input image. This is achieved by cascading
multiple Transformers with increasing numbers of tokens, which are sequentially
activated in an adaptive fashion at test time, i.e., the inference is
terminated once a sufficiently confident prediction is produced. We further
design efficient feature reuse and relationship reuse mechanisms across
different components of the Dynamic Transformer to reduce redundant
computations. Extensive empirical results on ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the competitive baselines
in terms of both theoretical computational efficiency and practical inference
speed. Code and pre-trained models (based on PyTorch and MindSpore) are

each person can appear in different cities or countries, and in various time

convolutional operations limit the development of image deraining tasks.
Recently, the popular transformer has global computational features that can
further facilitate the development of image deraining tasks. In this paper, we
introduce Swin-transformer into the field of image deraining for the first time
to study the performance and potential of Swin-transformer in the field of

and design a three-branch model to implement single-image rain removal. The
former implements the basic rain pattern feature extraction, while the latter
fuses different features to further extract and process the image features. In
addition, we employ a jump connection to fuse deep features and shallow
features. In terms of experiments, the existing public dataset suffers from
image duplication and relatively homogeneous background. So we propose a new
dataset Rain3000 to validate our model. Therefore, we propose a new dataset
Rain3000 for validating our model. Experimental results on the publicly

metrics show that the machine learning algorithms perform better than the
threshold technique, an examination of the shelter access histories of the

very similar characteristics. This has important implications for resource

implemented using much simpler information technology infrastructure than the

$\mathbb{R}^N$ is a generic task related to many problems in machine learning
and statistics, such as dictionary learning, subspace recovery, principal
component analysis, and non-Gaussian component analysis. In this work, we study
computationally efficient estimation and detection of a planted vector $v$
whose $\ell_4$ norm differs from that of a Gaussian vector with the same
$\ell_2$ norm. For instance, in the special case where $v$ is an $N
\rho$-sparse vector with Bernoulli-Gaussian or Bernoulli-Rademacher entries,
our results include the following:
  (1) We give an improved analysis of a slight variant of the spectral method
proposed by Hopkins, Schramm, Shi, and Steurer (2016), showing that it
approximately recovers $v$ with high probability in the regime $n \rho \ll
\sqrt{N}$. This condition subsumes the conditions $\rho \ll 1/\sqrt{n}$ or $n
\sqrt{\rho} \lesssim \sqrt{N}$ required by previous work up to polylogarithmic
factors. We achieve $\ell_\infty$ error bounds for the spectral estimator via a
leave-one-out analysis, from which it follows that a simple thresholding
procedure exactly recovers $v$ with Bernoulli-Rademacher entries, even in the
dense case $\rho = 1$.
  (2) We study the associated detection problem and show that in the regime $n
\rho \gg \sqrt{N}$, any spectral method from a large class (and more generally,
any low-degree polynomial of the input) fails to detect the planted vector.
This matches the condition for recovery and offers evidence that no
polynomial-time algorithm can succeed in recovering a Bernoulli-Gaussian vector
$v$ when $n \rho \gg \sqrt{N}$.

quality gains by leveraging the parameters with sparse activation. In this
work, we investigate several key factors in sparse expert models. We observe
that load imbalance may not be a significant problem affecting model quality,
contrary to the perspectives of recent studies, while the number of sparsely
activated experts $k$ and expert capacity $C$ in top-$k$ routing can
significantly make a difference in this context. Furthermore, we take a step
forward to propose a simple method called expert prototyping that splits
experts into different prototypes and applies $k$ top-$1$ routing. This
strategy improves the model quality but maintains constant computational costs,
and our further exploration on extremely large-scale models reflects that it is
more effective in training larger models. We push the model scale to over $1$

compared to the standard-installation ""Uppsala-injector"" for AuNPs and results
for these heavy particles show a shift in the particle-beam focus position
rather than a change in beam size, which results in a lower gas background for
the optimized injector. Optimized aerodynamic-lens stack injectors will allow

the neutrino oscillation data, leads to interesting predictions on the Yukawa
sector of the model HDOs. The thermal evolution of the baryon asymmetry has
followed the experimental results rather accurately in that corner of parameter
space. As a matter of fact, this TeV-scale framework which in principle relies
on the low scale resonant leptogenesis typically leads to predictions that
potentially can be tested at the colliders. In particular, we consider the
same-sign dilepton signature that arises from the RHN pair production through
the decay of heavy gauge boson of the extra ${\textrm U}(1)$.

optimization problem with a convex objective function, linear velocity and
acceleration constraints, and non-convex jerk constraints, which, thus,
represent the main source of difficulty. While existing non-linear programming
(NLP) solvers can be employed for the solution of this problem, it turns out
that the performance and robustness of such solvers can be enhanced by the
sequential line-search algorithm proposed in this paper. At each iteration a
feasible direction, with respect to the current feasible solution, is computed,
and a step along such direction is taken in order to compute the next iterate.
The computation of the feasible direction is based on the solution of a

through an approach which strongly exploits its special structure, represents
the main contribution of this work. The efficiency of the proposed approach

system driven by strong, ultrabroadband half- and single-cycle pulses, which
are shorter than the inverse of the transition frequency. In this driving
regime, the plateau in frequency spectra typical for radiation from strongly
driven systems, has noticeable modulation in amplitude due to interference
between waves of a same frequency and emitted at different time instants.
Specifically, there is a characteristic `dips' structure at a set of
frequencies in the radiation spectra, where the corresponding amplitudes are
suppressed by several orders of magnitude. Understanding of this structure is
required for applications such as generation of attosecond pulse, where number
of composing modes and their relative phases are important. Therefore, we
demonstrate a systematic way to find frequencies at which the dips are formed.
To further illustrate the interference mechanism, we extract the phase
information with the help of time-frequency distribution functions, namely the
Husimi and Wigner functions. Especially, we found that the negativity structure
of the Wigner function corresponds to each dip frequency and that the
information regarding the type of interference is encoded in the pattern of the
negative region of the Wigner function. Since such time-frequency Wigner
function can actually be measured, we envisage utilizing its negativity
structure to extract the phase information between radiation components emitted
at time points within a subcycle time scale. This should provide an efficient
tool for understanding and designing photonic applications, including
short-wavelength coherent light sources.

the importance of ordered crowding on the diffusion of globular macromolecules,

first investigate the diffusion of such guest tracers in very weakly ordered
host phases of cuboids and, by increasing density above the
isotropic-to-nematic phase boundary, study the influence of long-range
orientational ordering imposed by the occurrence of liquid-crystalline phases.
To this end, we analyse a spectrum of dynamical properties that clarify the
existence of slow and fast tracers and the extent of deviations from Gaussian
behaviour. Our results unveil the existence of randomly oriented clusters of
cuboids that display a relatively large size in dense isotropic phases, but are
basically absent in the nematic phase. We believe that these clusters are
responsible for a pronounced non-Gaussian dynamics that is much weaker in the
nematic phase, where orientational ordering smooths out such structural
heterogeneities.

that the Hall angle is independent of the magnetic field, and reaches an order
of unity at low temperatures in BSCCO. However, in YBCO, the angle increases
with increasing magnetic field even at low temperatures. We understood that
this difference in the magnetic field dependence of the Hall angle is due to
the difference in the influence of the pinning, which originated from the
difference in the vortex state (liquid vs. solid) between the two materials.
However, as a common feature, both materials showed a large tangent of the Hall
angle at low temperatures, which was larger by an order of magnitude than those
obtained in the effective viscous drag coefficient measurements. We discussed
the origin of the discrepancy both in terms of the possible nonlinearity of the
viscous drag force and possible hidden dissipation mechanisms. The unexpectedly

representations for neural networks by analyzing its feature learning process.
We consider the case where our data are comprised of two types of features: the
more semantically aligned sparse features which we want to learn from, and the
other dense features we want to avoid. Theoretically, we prove that contrastive
learning using $\mathbf{ReLU}$ networks provably learns the desired sparse
features if proper augmentations are adopted. We present an underlying
principle called $\textbf{feature decoupling}$ to explain the effects of
augmentations, where we theoretically characterize how augmentations can reduce
the correlations of dense features between positive samples while keeping the
correlations of sparse features intact, thereby forcing the neural networks to
learn from the self-supervision of sparse features. Empirically, we verified
that the feature decoupling principle matches the underlying mechanism of
contrastive learning in practice.

long-period pulsating hot subdwarf B (sdB) stars. We perform a detailed
asteroseismic and spectroscopic analysis of five pulsating sdB stars observed
with {\it TESS} aiming at the global comparison of the observations with the
model predictions based on our stellar evolution computations coupled with the
adiabatic pulsation computations. We apply standard seismic tools for mode
identification, including asymptotic period spacings and rotational frequency
multiplets. We calculate the mean period spacing for $l = 1$ and $l = 2$ modes
and estimate the errors by means of a statistical resampling analysis. For all
stars, atmospheric parameters were derived by fitting synthetic spectra to the
newly obtained low-resolution spectra. We have computed stellar evolution
models using {\tt LPCODE} stellar evolution code, and computed $l = 1$ g-mode
frequencies with the adiabatic non-radial pulsation code {\tt LP-PUL}. Derived
observational mean period spacings are then compared to the mean period
spacings from detailed stellar evolution computations coupled with the
adiabatic pulsation computations of g-modes. The atmospheric parameters derived
from spectroscopic data are typical of long-period pulsating sdB stars with the
effective temperature ranging from 23\,700\,K to 27\,600\,K and surface gravity
spanning from 5.3\,dex to 5.5\,dex. In agreement with the expectations from
theoretical arguments and previous asteroseismological works, we find that the
mean period spacings obtained for models with small convective cores, as
predicted by a pure Schwarzschild criterion, are incompatible with the
observations. We find that models with a standard/modest convective boundary
mixing at the boundary of the convective core are in better agreement with the
observed mean period spacings and are therefore more realistic.

  Applications, Vol. 12, No. 5, 2021",,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The general acceptance of sequence diagrams can be attributed to their
relatively intuitive nature and ability to describe partial behaviors (as
opposed to such diagrams as state charts). However, studies have shown that
over 80 percent of graduating students were unable to create a software design
or even a partial design, and many students had no idea how sequence diagrams
were constrained by other models. Many students exhibited difficulties in
identifying valid interacting objects and constructing messages with
appropriate arguments. Additionally, according to authorities, even though many
different semantics have been proposed for sequence diagrams (e.g.,
translations to state machines), there exists no suitable semantic basis
refinement of required sequence diagram behavior because direct style semantics
do not precisely capture required sequence diagram behaviors; translations to
other formalisms disregard essential features of sequence diagrams such as
guard conditions and critical regions. This paper proposes an alternative to
sequence diagrams, a generalized model that provides further understanding of
sequence diagrams to assimilate them into a new modeling language called
thinging machine (TM). The sequence diagram is extended horizontally by
removing the superficial vertical-only dimensional limitation of expansion to
preserve the logical chronology of events. TM diagramming is spread nonlinearly
in terms of actions. Events and their chronology are constructed on a second
plane of description that is superimposed on the initial static description.
The result is a more refined representation that would simplify the modeling
process. This is demonstrated through remodeling sequence diagram cases from
the literature.

exponential profile and shown to be consistent with a vertical
advective-diffusive balance. However, tracer release experiments show that
vertical diffusivity in the mid-depth ocean is an order of magnitude too small
to explain the observed 1 km exponential scale. Alternative mechanisms
suggested that the overturning is mostly adiabatic, that interior diapycnal
upwelling is negligible, and that nearly all mid-depth water upwells
adiabatically in the Southern Ocean (SO). In this picture, SO eddies and wind
set isopycnal slopes in the SO and therefore determine a non-vanishing
mid-depth interior stratification even in the adiabatic limit. The effect of SO
eddies on SO isopycnal slopes can be understood via either a marginal
criticality condition or via a near-vanishing residual overturning conditions
in the adiabatic limit. We examine the role of SO eddies vs interior mixing in
setting the mid-depth stratification by using eddy-permitting numerical
simulations, in which we artificially change the diapycnal mixing only away
from the SO. We find that SO isopycnal slopes change in response to changes of
the interior diapycnal mixing even when the wind forcing is constant,
consistent with previous studies. However, in the limit of small interior
mixing, the interior stratification is far from exponential, suggesting that SO
processes alone do not lead to the observed stratification. The results suggest
that while SO eddies contribute to the non-vanishing mid-depth interior
stratification, the exponential shape of the stratification must also involve
interior diapycnal mixing. Both SO eddies and interior diapycnal mixing are
therefore important in determining the interior mid-depth exponential
stratification.

design the transmit covariance matrices for each base station (BS).
Specifically, optimization schemes for this max-min EE problem are developed,
in the centralized and distributed ways, respectively. To obtain the transmit
covariance matrices, we first find out the closed-form optimal transmit
eigenmatrices for the BS in each cell, and convert the original transmit
covariance matrices designing problem into a power allocation one. Then, to
lower the computational complexity, we utilize an asymptotic approximation
expression for the problem objective. Moreover, for the power allocation
design, we adopt the minorization maximization method to address the
non-convexity of the ergodic rate, and use Dinkelbach's transform to convert
the max-min fractional problem into a series of convex optimization
subproblems. To tackle the transformed subproblems, we propose a centralized
iterative water-filling scheme. For reducing the backhaul burden, we further
develop a distributed algorithm for the power allocation problem, which
requires limited inter-cell information sharing. Finally, the performance of

training a generative model from a classifier's signal, DISSECT offers a way to
discover a classifier's inherent ""notion"" of distinct concepts automatically
rather than rely on user-predefined concepts. We show that DISSECT produces CTs
that (1) disentangle several concepts, (2) are influential to a classifier's
decision and are coupled to its reasoning due to joint training (3), are
realistic, (4) preserve relevant information, and (5) are stable across similar
inputs. We validate DISSECT on several challenging synthetic and realistic
datasets where previous methods fall short of satisfying desirable criteria for
interpretability and show that it performs consistently well and better than
existing methods. Finally, we present experiments showing applications of
DISSECT for detecting potential biases of a classifier and identifying spurious
artifacts that impact predictions.

the model of Z(Mod-B) in terms of braided B-module categories, we develop a
computationally useful model in terms of certain algebra objects in B. We

Still, a broader perspective on the news ecosystem, including both the

assess the health of the infosphere. Here, we combine in the same framework
news supply, as mirrored by a fairly complete Italian news database - partially

data for Italy. Our investigation focuses on the temporal and semantic
interplay of news, fake news, and searches in several domains, including the
virus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Two main results emerge. First, disinformation is
extremely reactive to people's interests and tends to thrive, especially when
there is a mismatch between what people are interested in and what news outlets
provide. Second, a suitably defined index can assess the level of
disinformation only based on the available volumes of news and searches.
Although our results mainly concern the Coronavirus subject, we provide hints
that the same findings can have more general applications. We contend these

vortex swirling flow seen in classical viscous fluids. Yet, a quantum vortex
accelerating in a superfluid may lose its energy into acoustic radiation, in a
similar way an electric charge decelerates upon emitting photons. The
dissipation of vortex energy underlies central problems in quantum
hydrodynamics, such as the decay of quantum turbulence, highly relevant to
systems as varied as neutron stars, superfluid helium and atomic condensates. A
deep understanding of the elementary mechanisms behind irreversible vortex
dynamics has been a goal for decades, but it is complicated by the shortage of
conclusive experimental signatures. Here, we address this challenge by
realising a programmable quantum vortex collider in a planar, homogeneous
atomic Fermi superfluid with tunable inter-particle interactions. We create
on-demand vortex configurations and monitor their evolution, taking advantage
of the accessible time and length scales of our ultracold Fermi gas.
Engineering collisions within and between vortex-antivortex pairs allows us to
decouple relaxation of the vortex energy due to sound emission and interactions
with normal fluid, i.e. mutual friction. We directly visualise how the
annihilation of vortex dipoles radiates a sound pulse in the superfluid.
Further, our few-vortex experiments extending across different superfluid
regimes suggest that fermionic quasiparticles localised inside the vortex core
contribute significantly to dissipation, opening the route to exploring new
pathways for quantum turbulence decay, vortex by vortex.

We show that even with unbiased input data, when a model is mis-specified: (1)
population-level mean prediction error can still be negligible, but group-level
mean prediction errors can be large; (2) such errors are not equal across

mean prediction errors for these two groups have the same magnitude but
opposite signs. In closed form, we show such errors and bias are functions of

It
allows to express complex computations by composing elementary ones in creative
ways and removes the burden of computing their derivatives by hand. More
recently, differentiation of optimization problem solutions has attracted
widespread attention with applications such as optimization layers, and in
bi-level problems such as hyper-parameter optimization and meta-learning.
However, so far, implicit differentiation remained difficult to use for
practitioners, as it often required case-by-case tedious mathematical
derivations and implementations. In this paper, we propose automatic implicit
differentiation, an efficient and modular approach for implicit differentiation
of optimization problems. In our approach, the user defines directly in Python
a function $F$ capturing the optimality conditions of the problem to be
differentiated. Once this is done, we leverage autodiff of $F$ and the implicit
function theorem to automatically differentiate the optimization problem. Our
approach thus combines the benefits of implicit differentiation and autodiff.
It is efficient as it can be added on top of any state-of-the-art solver and
modular as the optimality condition specification is decoupled from the
implicit differentiation mechanism. We show that seemingly simple principles
allow to recover many existing implicit differentiation methods and create new
ones easily. We demonstrate the ease of formulating and solving bi-level
optimization problems using our framework. We also showcase an application to
the sensitivity analysis of molecular dynamics.

methodology, originating instabilities which are, instead, naturally eliminated
within EIT. The first part of this work is dedicated to reviewing the most
recent progress made in understanding the mathematical origin of this
instability problem. In the second part, we present the formalism that arises
by promoting non-equilibrium thermodynamics to a classical effective field
theory. We call this approach Unified Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics
(UEIT), because it contains, as particular cases, EIT itself, in particular the
Israel-Stewart theory and the divergence-type theories, plus Carter's approach
and most branches of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, such as relativistic
chemistry and radiation hydrodynamics. We use this formalism to explain why all
these theories are stable by construction (provided that the microscopic input
is correct), showing that their (Lyapunov) stability is a direct consequence of
the second law of thermodynamics.

competitive games, which is often modeled as a constrained saddle-point
optimization problem with probability simplex constraints. Despite recent
efforts in understanding the last-iterate convergence of extragradient methods
in the unconstrained setting, the theoretical underpinnings of these methods in
the constrained settings, especially those using multiplicative updates, remain
highly inadequate, even when the objective function is bilinear. Motivated by
the algorithmic role of entropy regularization in single-agent reinforcement
learning and game theory, we develop provably efficient extragradient methods
to find the quantal response equilibrium (QRE) -- which are solutions to
zero-sum two-player matrix games with entropy regularization -- at a linear
rate. The proposed algorithms can be implemented in a decentralized manner,
where each player executes symmetric and multiplicative updates iteratively
using its own payoff without observing the opponent's actions directly. In
addition, by controlling the knob of entropy regularization, the proposed
algorithms can locate an approximate Nash equilibrium of the unregularized
matrix game at a sublinear rate without assuming the Nash equilibrium to be
unique. Our methods also lead to efficient policy extragradient algorithms for
solving (entropy-regularized) zero-sum Markov games at similar rates. All of
our convergence rates are nearly dimension-free, which are independent of the
size of the state and action spaces up to logarithm factors, highlighting the
positive role of entropy regularization for accelerating convergence.

detectors. Almost all EMRIs will evolve through important transient orbital
$r\theta$ resonances, which will enhance or diminish their gravitational wave
flux, thereby affecting the phase evolution of the waveforms at
$O(\epsilon^{1/2})$ relative to leading order. While modeling the local
gravitational self-force (GSF) during resonances is essential for generating
accurate EMRI waveforms, so far the full GSF has not been calculated for an
$r\theta$-resonant orbit owing to computational demands of the problem. As a
first step we employ a simpler model, calculating the scalar self-force (SSF)
along $r\theta$-resonant geodesics in Kerr spacetime. We demonstrate two ways
of calculating the $r\theta$-resonant SSF (and likely GSF), with one method
leaving the radial and polar motions initially independent as if the geodesic
is nonresonant. We illustrate results by calculating the SSF along geodesics
defined by three $r\theta$-resonant ratios (1:3, 1:2, 2:3). We show how the SSF
and averaged evolution of the orbital constants vary with the initial phase at
which an EMRI enters resonance. We then use our SSF data to test a previously
proposed integrability conjecture, which argues that conservative effects
vanish at adiabatic order during resonances. We find prominent contributions
from the conservative SSF to the secular evolution of the Carter constant,
$\langle \dot{\mathcal{Q}}\rangle$, but these nonvanishing contributions are on
the order of, or less than, the estimated uncertainties of our self-force
results. The uncertainties come from residual, incomplete removal of the
singular field in the regularization process. Higher order regularization

Predicting the amount of energy a flight will consume is challenging as

We develop a deep energy model for a UAV that uses Temporal Convolutional
Networks to capture the time varying features while incorporating static
contextual information. Our energy model is trained on a real world dataset and
does not require segregating flights into regimes. We illustrate an improvement
in power predictions by $29\%$ on test flights when compared to a
state-of-the-art analytical method. Using the energy model, we can predict the
energy usage for a given trajectory and evaluate the risk of running out of
battery during flight. We propose using Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as a
metric for quantifying this risk. We show that CVaR captures the risk
associated with worst-case energy consumption on a nominal path by transforming
the output distribution of Monte Carlo forward simulations into a risk space.
Computing the CVaR on the risk-space distribution provides a metric that can
evaluate the overall risk of a flight before take-off. Our energy model and
risk evaluation method can improve flight safety and evaluate the coverage area

correlated conduction electron host such as Nd$_{1-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_2$ persists

how do local moments couple to correlated but integrable hosts? We describe the
conduction electrons by the model of Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) which has undergone
a recent resurgence arising from its exact solvability, existence of Luttinger
surfaces, and connections to Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) thermodynamics. We derive
an exact low energy ""Kondo-HK"" Hamiltonian and show the existence of additional
spin-exchange coupling that is relevant in the renormalization group (RG)
sense. This term is ferromagnetic and does not vanish at low energies yielding
an algebraic enhancement of the Kondo temperature. ""Poor man's"" scaling of
couplings exhibits an exotic step-like RG flow between UV-IR fixed points
attributed to severely restricted scattering phase space. This phenomenon is
analogous to the flow of central charge in Zamolodchikov's diagonal resonance
scattering in integrable quantum field theories.

this conjecture is supported by the saddle point approximation. If there are

Therefore, the derivation of the conjecture is incomplete if there are multiple
extremal surfaces that extend from a sub-system on the AdS boundary. We will
consider two disjoint intervals in CFT$_{1+1}$ as the simplest but non-trivial

galaxies' star formation history. Three out of the 7 COSMOS galaxies have an
optical spectra with no emission line, confirming their quenched nature.
Present physical properties of the two samples are obtained as well as the past
L$_{IR}$ of these galaxies, just before their quenching, from the long-term SFH
properties. This past L$_{IR}$ is shown to be consistent with the L$_{IR}$ of
reference samples of normally star-forming galaxies with same $M_*$ and $z$
than each of our quenched galaxies. We put constraints on the present to past
L$_{IR}$ ratio as a function of quenching time. The two samples probe different
dynamical ranges in terms of quenching age with the HRS galaxies exhibiting
longer timescales (0.2-3\,Gyr) compared to the COSMOS one ($<100$\,Myr).
Assuming an exponential decrease of the L$_{IR}$ after quenching, the COSMOS
quenched galaxies are consistent with short e-folding times less than a couple
of hundreds of Myr while the properties of the HRS quenched galaxies are
compatible with timescales of several hundreds of Myr. For the HRS sample, this
result is consistent with ram pressure stripping due to the environment. For
the COSMOS sample, different quenching processes are acting on short to
intermediate timescales. Processes such as galaxy mergers, disk instabilities

unknown. Using simulations of isolated disc galaxies, we study how the
structure of the interstellar medium and the stability regime of the discs
change when varying the gas fraction. In all galaxies, the stellar component is
the main driver of instabilities. However, the molecular gas plays a
non-negligible role in the inter-clumps medium of gas-rich cases, and thus in
the assembly of the massive clumps. At scales smaller than a few 100 pc, the
Toomre-like disc instabilities are replaced by another regime, specially in the
gas-rich galaxies. We find that galaxies at low gas fraction (10%) stand apart
from discs with more gas, which all share similar properties on virtually all
the aspects we explore. For gas fractions below approximately 20%, the
clump-scale regime of instabilities disappears, only leaving the large-scale
disc-driven regime. When translating the change of gas fraction to the cosmic
evolution of galaxies, this transition marks the end of the clumpy phase of
disc galaxies, and allows for the onset of spiral structures, as commonly found
in the local Universe.

dark-photon dark matter: a monochromatic oscillating magnetic field generated
at the surface of the Earth. Similar to the signal in a laboratory experiment
in a shielded box (or cavity), this signal arises because the lower atmosphere
is a low-conductivity air gap sandwiched between the highly conductive interior
of the Earth below and ionosphere or interplanetary medium above. At low masses
(frequencies) the signal in a laboratory detector is usually suppressed by the
size of the detector multiplied by the dark-matter mass. Crucially, in our case
the suppression is by the radius of the Earth, and not by the (much smaller)
height of the atmosphere. We compute the size and global vectorial pattern of
our magnetic field signal, which enables sensitive searches for this signal
using unshielded magnetometers dispersed over the surface of the Earth. In
principle, the signal we compute exists for any dark photon in the mass range
$10^{-21} \text{eV}\lesssim m_{A'} \lesssim 3\times 10^{-14} \text{eV}$. We
summarize the results of our companion paper [arXiv:2108.08852], in which we
detail such a search using a publicly available dataset from the SuperMAG
Collaboration: we report no robust signal candidates and so place constraints
in the (more limited) dark-photon dark-matter mass range $2\times 10^{-18}
\text{eV} \lesssim m_{A'} \lesssim 7\times 10^{-17} \text{eV}$ (corresponding
to frequencies $6\times 10^{-4} \text{Hz}\lesssim f \lesssim 2\times 10^{-2}

bounds. Future searches for this signal may improve the sensitivity over a wide

However, until now, observational difficulties have prevented us from taking

bulge Cluster APOgee Survey, addresses this key topic by observing a large
number of BGCs, most of which have only been poorly studied previously. Even
their most basic parameters, such as metallicity, [{\alpha}/Fe], and radial
velocity, are generally very uncertain. We aim to obtain accurate mean values
for these parameters, as well as abundances for a number of other elements, and
explore multiple populations. In this first paper, we describe the CAPOS
project and present initial results for seven BGCs. Methods. CAPOS uses the
APOGEE-2S spectrograph observing in the H band to penetrate obscuring dust
toward the bulge. For this initial paper, we use abundances derived from
ASPCAP, the APOGEE pipeline. Results. We derive mean [Fe/H] values of
$-$0.85$\pm$0.04 (Terzan 2), $-$1.40$\pm$0.05 (Terzan 4), $-$1.20$\pm$0.10 (HP

cluster. We determine mean abundances for eleven other elements plus the mean
[$\alpha$/Fe] and radial velocity. CAPOS clusters significantly increase the
sample of well-studied Main Bulge globular clusters (GCs) and also extend them
to lower metallicity. We reinforce the finding that Main Bulge and Main Disk
GCs, formed in situ, have [Si/Fe] abundances slightly higher than their
accreted counterparts at the same metallicity. We investigate multiple
populations and find our clusters generally follow the light-element
(anti)correlation trends of previous studies of GCs of similar metallicity. We

bulge region, evoking the name Sequoia, this has been an intriguing object with
a highly debated origin, and initially led to the suggestion of a purported
progenitor dwarf galaxy of the same name. In this work, we use new
spectroscopic and astrometric data to provide additional clues to the nature of

for the first time the existence of the characteristic N-C anti-correlation and
Al-N correlation, revealing the existence of the multiple-population
phenomenon, similar to that observed in virtually all GCs. Furthermore, the
presence of a population with strongly enriched aluminium makes it unlikely FSR
1758 is the remnant nucleus of a dwarf galaxy, as Al-enhanced stars are
uncommon in dwarf galaxies. We find that FSR 1758 is slightly more metal rich
than previously reported in the literature, with a mean metallicity [Fe/H]
between $-1.43$ to $-1.36$ (depending on the adopted atmospheric parameters),
and with a scatter within observational error, again pointing to its GC nature.
Overall, the $\alpha$-enrichment ($\gtrsim+0.3$ dex), Fe-peak (Fe, Ni), light-

GCs. ... A new examination of its dynamical properties with the

Chalker-Coddington network model with balanced gain and loss. This model
belongs to the class D^dagger with particle-hole symmetry^dagger and hosts both
the non-Hermitian skin effect as well as exceptional points. By calculating its
two-terminal transmission, we find a novel contact effect induced by the skin
effect, which results in a non-quantized transmission for chiral edge states.
In addition, the model exhibits an insulator to 'supermetal' transition, across
which the transmission changes from exponentially decaying with system size to
exponentially growing with system size. In the clean system, the critical point
separating insulator from supermetal is characterized by a non-Hermitian Dirac
point that produces a quantized critical transmission of 4, instead of the
value of 1 expected in Hermitian systems. This change in critical transmission
is a consequence of the balanced gain and loss. When adding disorder to the
system, we find a critical exponent for the divergence of the localization
length \nu \approx 1, which is the same as that characterizing the universality
class of two-dimensional Hermitian systems in class D. Our work provides a
novel way of exploring the localization behavior of non-Hermitian systems, by
using network models, which in the past proved versatile tools to describe

Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging data. The new imaging data cover the
3.5$\times$3.5 Mpc region centered on the cluster and enable us to detect WL
signals beyond the virial radius, which was not possible in previous studies.
We confirm the binary mass structure consisting of the northwestern (NW) and
southeastern (SE) subclusters and the 2$\sigma$ dissociation between the SE
mass peak and the X-ray cool core. We obtain the mass estimates of the
subclusters by simultaneously fitting two Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) halos
without employing mass-concentration relations. The masses are $M_{200c}^{NW} =
9.9^{+2.1}_{-2.2} \times 10^{14} M_{\sun}$ and $M_{200c}^{SE} =
6.5^{+1.9}_{-1.4} \times 10^{14} M_{\sun}$ for the NW and SE subclusters,
respectively. The mass ratio is consistent with our previous WL study but
significantly different from the previous strong lensing results. This
discrepancy is attributed to the use of extrapolation in strong lensing studies
because the SE component possesses a higher concentration. By superposing the
two best-fit NFW halos, we determine the total mass of El Gordo to be $M_{200c}
= 2.13^{+0.25}_{-0.23} \times 10^{15} M_{\sun}$, which is 23% lower than our
previous WL result [$M_{200c} =(2.76\pm0.51) \times 10^{15} M_{\sun}$]. Our
updated mass is a more direct measurement since we are not extrapolating to
$R_{200c}$ as in all previous studies. The new mass is compatible with the
current $\Lambda$CDM cosmology.

this paper, we study how this geometric character is revealed in the intrinsic
optical response of the superconducting state. In particular, due to the
superconducting gap opening, interband optical transitions involving states
around the Fermi level are forbidden. This generally leads to an anomalous
suppression of the optical conductivity at frequencies matching the band
separation -- which could be significantly higher than the superconducting gap
energy. We discuss how the predicted anomaly may have already emerged in two
earlier measurements on an iron-based superconductor. When interband Cooper
pairing is present, intraband optical transitions may be allowed and finite
conductivity emerges at low frequencies right above the gap edge. These
conductivities depend crucially on the off-diagonal elements of the velocity

related to the non-Abelian Berry connection of the Bloch states.

both cases, we directly relate their bulk topology to a stable dislocation

and structured documents (artifacts) cooperative edition. Indeed, we develop
mathematical tools that allow any workflow systems designer, to express each

represent tasks to be executed, productions specify a scheduling of these
tasks, and instances (the derivation trees that conform to it) represent the
different execution scenarios leading to business goal states. The obtained
grammatical model is then introduced into a proposed P2P system which is in
charge of carrying out the completely decentralised execution of the underlying
process's instances. The said system orchestrates a process's instance
execution as a choreography during which, various software agents driven by
human agents (actors), coordinate themselves through artifacts that they
collectively edit. The exchanged artifacts represent the system's memory: they
provide information on already executed tasks, on those ready to be executed
and on their executors. The software agents are autonomous and identical: they
execute the same unique protocol each time they receive an artifact. This
protocol allows them to identify the tasks they must immediately execute, to
execute them, to update the artifact and to disseminate it if necessary, for
the continuation of the execution. Moreover, actors potentially have only a
partial perception of processes in which they are involved. In practice, this
means that certain tasks can be carried out confidentially.

speaker so that it appears to be said by a different target speaker while
retaining the linguistic content of the utterance. Recent advances have led to
major improvements in the quality of voice conversion systems. However, to be
useful in a wider range of contexts, voice conversion systems would need to be
(i) trainable without access to parallel data, (ii) work in a zero-shot setting
where both the source and target speakers are unseen during training, and (iii)
run in real time or faster. Recent techniques fulfil one or two of these
requirements, but not all three. This paper extends recent voice conversion
models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs), to satisfy all three of
these conditions. We specifically extend the recent StarGAN-VC model by
conditioning it on a speaker embedding (from a potentially unseen speaker).
This allows the model to be used in a zero-shot setting, and we therefore call
it StarGAN-ZSVC. We compare StarGAN-ZSVC against other voice conversion
techniques in a low-resource setting using a small 9-minute training set.
Compared to AutoVC -- another recent neural zero-shot approach -- we observe
that StarGAN-ZSVC gives small improvements in the zero-shot setting, showing
that real-time zero-shot voice conversion is possible even for a model trained
on very little data. Further work is required to see whether scaling up
StarGAN-ZSVC will also improve zero-shot voice conversion quality in
high-resource contexts.

Few examples are known of pairs of matroids with the same

where $m$ is a positive integer. We show that the $\mathcal{G}$-invariant of

atoms, has long stood as a popular method for learning representations in
statistics and signal processing. The most popular dictionary learning
algorithm alternates between sparse coding and dictionary update steps, and a
rich literature has studied its theoretical convergence. The success of
dictionary learning relies on access to a ""good"" initial estimate of the
dictionary and the ability of the sparse coding step to provide an unbiased
estimate of the code. The growing popularity of unrolled sparse coding networks
has led to the empirical finding that backpropagation through such networks
performs dictionary learning. We offer the theoretical analysis of these
empirical results through PUDLE, a Provable Unrolled Dictionary LEarning
method. We provide conditions on the network initialization and data
distribution sufficient to recover and preserve the support of the latent code.
Additionally, we address two challenges; first, the vanilla unrolled sparse
coding computes a biased code estimate, and second, gradients during
backpropagated learning can become unstable. We show approaches to reduce the
bias of the code estimate in the forward pass, and that of the dictionary
estimate in the backward pass. We propose strategies to resolve the learning
instability by tuning network parameters and modifying the loss function.
Overall, we highlight the impact of loss, unrolling, and backpropagation on
convergence. We complement our findings through synthetic and image denoising
experiments. Finally, we demonstrate PUDLE's interpretability, a driving factor
in designing deep networks based on iterative optimizations, by building a
mathematical relation between network weights, its output, and the training
set.

retrieval. We define the problem as retrieving a sequence of items with a
gradual change on a certain attribute, given a reference item and a
modification text. For example, after a customer saw a white dress, she/he
wants to buy a similar one but more floral on it. The extent of ""more floral""
is subjective, thus prompting one floral dress is hard to satisfy the
customer's needs. A better way is to present a sequence of products with
increasingly floral attributes based on the white dress, and allow the customer
to select the most satisfactory one from the sequence. Existing item retrieval
methods mainly focus on whether the target items appear at the top of the
retrieved sequence, but ignore the demand for retrieving a sequence of products
with gradual change on a certain attribute. To deal with this problem, we
propose a weakly-supervised method that can learn a disentangled item
representation from user-item interaction data and ground the semantic meaning
of attributes to dimensions of the item representation. Our method takes a
reference item and a modification as a query. During inference, we start from
the reference item and ""walk"" along the direction of the modification in the
item representation space to retrieve a sequence of items in a gradient manner.
We demonstrate our proposed method can achieve disentanglement through weak
supervision. Besides, we empirically show that an item sequence retrieved by
our method is gradually changed on an indicated attribute and, in the item
retrieval task, our method outperforms existing approaches on three different

minimize energy costs through intelligent workload distribution. With
increasing data volumes in emerging cloud workloads, it is critical to factor
in the network costs for transferring workloads across data centers. For
geo-distributed data centers, many researchers have been exploring strategies
for energy cost minimization and intelligent inter-data-center workload
distribution separately. However, prior work does not comprehensively and
simultaneously consider data center energy costs, data transfer costs, and data
center queueing delay. In this paper, we propose a novel game theory-based
workload management framework that takes a holistic approach to the cloud
operating cost minimization problem by making intelligent scheduling decisions
aware of data transfer costs and the data center queueing delay. Our framework
performs intelligent workload management that considers heterogeneity in data
center compute capability, cooling power, interference effects from task
co-location in servers, time-of-use electricity pricing, renewable energy, net
metering, peak demand pricing distribution, and network pricing. Our
simulations show that the proposed game-theoretic technique can minimize the
cloud operating cost more effectively than existing approaches.

the underlying spatio-temporal dynamics of the transmission of COVID-19. Such
latent variables follow a zero-mean Gaussian process, whose covariance is
specified by a non-stationary kernel function. The most salient feature of our
kernel function is that deep neural networks are introduced to enhance the
model's representative power while still enjoying the interpretability of the

strategy to circumvent the computational intractability for large data sets.
Our model demonstrates better interpretability and superior hotspot-detection

kinetics has resulted in numerous theoretical explorations into the methodology
for predicting it. Nevertheless, there are still key aspects of the derivations
that are lacking, particularly for non-separable systems in the low temperature
regime, and further explorations of the physical factors affecting the
tunneling rate are warranted. In this work we obtain a closed-form rate
expression for the tunneling rate constant that is a direct analog of the
rigid-rotor-harmonic-oscillator expression. This expression introduces a novel
""entanglement factor"" that modulates the reaction rate. Furthermore, we are
able to extend this expression, which is valid for non-separable systems at low
temperatures, to properly account for the conservation of angular momentum. In
contrast, previous calculations have considered only vibrational transverse
modes and so effectively employ a decoupled rotational partition function for
the orientational modes. We also suggest a simple theoretical model to describe
the tunneling effects in the vicinity of the crossover temperature (the
temperature where tunneling becomes the dominating mechanism). This model
allows one to naturally classify, interpret, and predict experimental data.
Among other things, it quantitatively explains in simple terms the so-called
""quantum bobsled"" effect, also known as the negative centrifugal effect, which
is related to curvature of the reaction path. Taken together, the expressions
obtained here allow one to predict the thermal and $E$-resolved rate constants

will require both statistical analyses of the population of habitable planets
as well as in-depth analyses of the climates of individual planets. Given the
close relationship between habitability and surface liquid water, it is
important to ask whether the fraction of a planet's surface where water can be
a liquid, $\chi_\text{hab}$, can be inferred from observations. We have
produced a diverse bank of 1,874 3D climate models and computed the full-phase
reflectance and emission spectrum for each model to investigate whether surface
climate inference is feasible with high-quality direct imaging or secondary
eclipse spectroscopy. These models represent the outcome of approximately
200,000 total simulated years of climate and over 50,000 CPU-hours, and the
roughly-100 GB model bank and its associated spectra are being made
publicly-available for community use. We find that there are correlations
between spectra and $\chi_\text{hab}$ that will permit statistical approaches.
However, spectral degeneracies in the climate observables produced by our model
bank indicate that inference of individual climates is likely to be
model-dependent, and inference will likely be impossible without exhaustive
explorations of the climate parameter space. The diversity of potential
climates on habitable planets therefore poses fundamental challenges to remote
sensing efforts targeting exo-Earths.

problems, each requiring attention to only one information source. An

applications involving graph signals. Theoretical findings establish that GNNs
use nonlinear activation functions to create low-eigenvalue frequency content
that can be processed in a stable manner by subsequent graph convolutional
filters. However, the exact shape of the frequency content created by nonlinear
functions is not known and cannot be learned. In this work, we use node-variant
graph filters (NVGFs) -- which are linear filters capable of creating
frequencies -- as a means of investigating the role that frequency creation
plays in GNNs. We show that, by replacing nonlinear activation functions by
NVGFs, frequency creation mechanisms can be designed or learned. By doing so,
the role of frequency creation is separated from the nonlinear nature of
traditional GNNs. Simulations on graph signal processing problems are carried
out to pinpoint the role of frequency creation.

available histological images using deep learning based neural networks.
Nucleus map set was used to train U-net to capture the nuclear architectural
information. Train set included the patients with HCC treated by resection and
has a distinct outcome. LT set contained patients with HCC treated by LT. Train
set and its nuclear architectural information extracted by U-net were used to
train MobileNet V2 based classifier (MobileNetV2_HCC_Class), purpose-built for
classifying supersized heterogeneous images. The MobileNetV2_HCC_Class
maintained relative higher discriminatory power than the other factors after
HCC resection or LT in the independent validation set. Pathological review
showed that the tumoral areas most predictive of recurrence were characterized
by presence of stroma, high degree of cytological atypia, nuclear
hyperchomasia, and a lack of immune infiltration. A clinically useful
prognostic classifier was developed using deep learning allied to histological
slides. The classifier has been extensively evaluated in independent patient
populations with different treatment, and gives consistent excellent results
across the classical clinical, biological and pathological features. The
classifier assists in refining the prognostic prediction of HCC patients and
identifying patients who would benefit from more intensive management.

given size $k$ from a set of $m$ candidates, with knowledge of voters' ordinal
rankings over all candidates. We consider the well-known and classic scoring
rule for achieving diverse representation: the Chamberlin-Courant (CC) or
$1$-Borda rule, where the score of a committee is the average over the voters,
of the rank of the best candidate in the committee for that voter; and its
generalization to the average of the top $s$ best candidates, called the
$s$-Borda rule.
  Our first result is an improved analysis of the natural and well-studied
greedy heuristic. We show that greedy achieves a $\left(1 -
\frac{2}{k+1}\right)$-approximation to the maximization (or satisfaction)
version of CC rule, and a $\left(1 - \frac{2s}{k+1}\right)$-approximation to
the $s$-Borda score. Our result improves on the best known approximation
algorithm for this problem. We show that these bounds are almost tight.
  For the dissatisfaction (or minimization) version of the problem, we show
that the score of $\frac{m+1}{k+1}$ can be viewed as an optimal benchmark for
the CC rule, as it is essentially the best achievable score of any
polynomial-time algorithm even when the optimal score is a polynomial factor
smaller (under standard computational complexity assumptions). We show that
another well-studied algorithm for this problem, called the Banzhaf rule,
attains this benchmark.
  We finally show that for the $s$-Borda rule, when the optimal value is small,
these algorithms can be improved by a factor of $\tilde \Omega(\sqrt{s})$ via
LP rounding. Our upper and lower bounds are a significant improvement over
previous results, and taken together, not only enable us to perform a finer
comparison of greedy algorithms for these problems, but also provide analytic
justification for using such algorithms in practice.

$Z\in\{0,1\}^{n\times m}$. The function $f$ is called an approximate

  We study the structure of exact polymorphisms as well as approximate
polymorphisms. Our results include:
  - We prove that an approximate polymorphism $f$ must be close to an exact
polymorphism;
  - We give a characterization of exact polymorphisms, showing that besides
trivial cases, only the functions $g = \mathsf{AND}, \mathsf{XOR}, \mathsf{OR},
\mathsf{NXOR}$ admit non-trivial exact polymorphisms.
  We also study the approximate polymorphism problem in the list-decoding
regime (i.e., when the probability equality holds is not close to $1$, but is
bounded away from some value). We show that if $f(x \land y) = f(x) \land f(y)$
with probability larger than $s_\land \approx 0.815$ then $f$ correlates with
some low-degree character, and $s_\land$ is the optimal threshold for this
property.
  Our result generalize the classical linearity testing result of Blum, Luby

of $g = \mathsf{XOR}$ are close to XOR's, as well as a recent result of Filmus,
Lifshitz, Minzer and Mossel, showing that the approximate polymorphisms of AND

spanned the range $10^3 \lesssim p/k \lesssim 10^4{\rm cm^{-3}K}$. In this
paper, we study Milky Way C I lines in the spectra of extragalactic sources
instead of Galactic stars and thus measure the pressures without being
influenced by regions where stellar mass loss and H II region expansions could
create localized pressure elevations. We find that the distribution of low
pressures in the current sample favors slightly higher pressures than the
earlier survey, and the fraction of gaseous material at extremely high
pressures is about the same as that found earlier. Thus we conclude that the
earlier survey was not appreciably influenced by the stellar environments, and
the small amounts of high pressure gas indeed exist within the general

operations. The monthly time scale allows us to identify transient and variable
sources that were not yet reported in other Fermi-LAT catalogs. The monthly
datasets were analyzed using a wavelet-based source detection algorithm that
provided the candidate new transient sources. The search was limited to the
extragalactic regions of the sky to avoid the dominance of the Galactic diffuse
emission at low Galactic latitudes. The transient candidates were then analyzed
using the standard Fermi-LAT Maximum Likelihood analysis method. All sources
detected with a statistical significance above 4$\sigma$ in at least one
monthly bin were listed in the final catalog. The 1FLT catalog contains 142
transient $\gamma$-ray sources that are not included in the 4FGL-DR2 catalog.
Many of these sources (102) have been confidently associated with Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN): 24 are associated with Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars; 1
with a BL Lac object; 70 with Blazars of Uncertain Type; 3 with Radio Galaxies;
1 with a Compact Steep Spectrum radio source; 1 with a Steep Spectrum Radio
Quasar; 2 with AGN of other types. The remaining 40 sources have no candidate
counterparts at other wavelengths. The median $\gamma$-ray spectral index of
the 1FLT-AGN sources is softer than that reported in the latest Fermi-LAT AGN
general catalog. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that detection
of the softest $\gamma$-ray emitters is less efficient when the data are
integrated over year-long intervals.

basis elements leveraged in approximation, higher order control occupation
kernels represent iterated integration after multiplication by a given
controller in a vector valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space. In a

Interestingly, the vector valued structure of the Hilbert space allows for

generate 2.5D (otherwise known as 3D level-of-detail (LOD) 1) maps for free
using Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals, which are globally
available and are blocked only by obstacles between the satellites and the
receivers. This enables us to find the patterns of GNSS signal availability and
create 3D maps. The paper applies algorithms to GNSS signal strength patterns
based on a boot-strapped technique that iteratively trains the signal
classifiers while generating the map. Results of the proposed technique
demonstrate the ability to create 3D maps using automatically processed GNSS
data. The results show that the third dimension, i.e. height of the buildings,
can be estimated with below 5 metre accuracy, which is the benchmark
recommended by the CityGML standard.

generalized (continuous) Nash game (referred to as generalized Nash equilibrium
problem (GNEP)) where each player's feasible strategy set depends on the other
players' strategies. The method is based on a new form of Lagrangian function
with a quadratic approximation. First, we reformulate a GNEP as a saddle point
computation problem using the new Lagrangian and establish equivalence between
a saddle point of the Lagrangian and an equilibrium of the GNEP. We then
propose a simple algorithm that is convergent to the saddle point. Furthermore,
we establish global convergence by assuming that the Lagrangian function
satisfies the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz property. A distinctive feature of our
analysis is to make use of the new Lagrangian as a potential function to guide
the iterate convergence. Our method has two novel features over existing
approaches: (i) it requires neither boundedness assumptions on the strategy set
and the set of multipliers of each player, nor any boundedness assumptions on
the iterates generated by the algorithm; (ii) it leads to a Jacobi-type
decomposition scheme, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first
development of a distributed algorithm to solve a general class of GNEPs.
Numerical experiments are performed on benchmark test problems and the results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

FOPT, the fermions are compressed into the false vacuum remnants to form
non-topological solitons called Fermi-balls, and then collapse to PBHs due to
the Yukawa attractive force. We derive the PBH mass and abundance, showing that
for a $\mathcal{O}({\rm GeV})$ FOPT the PBHs could be $\sim10^{17}$ g and
explain all of dark matter. If the FOPT happens at higher scale, PBHs are

shown to strongly improve model generalization and transfer learning in vast
line of work done in language modeling and natural image recognition. However,
most studies on the positive effect of larger scale were done in scope of
in-domain setting, with source and target data being in close proximity. To
study effect of larger scale for both in-domain and out-of-domain setting when
performing full and few-shot transfer, we combine here for the first time
large, openly available medical X-Ray chest imaging datasets to reach a scale
for medical imaging domain comparable to ImageNet-1k, routinely used for
pre-training in natural image domain. We then conduct supervised pre-training,
while varying network size and source data scale and domain, being either large
natural (ImageNet-1k/21k) or large medical chest X-Ray datasets, and transfer
pre-trained models to different natural or medical targets. We observe strong
improvement due to larger pre-training scale for intra-domain natural-natural
and medical-medical transfer. For inter-domain natural-medical transfer, we
find improvements due to larger pre-training scale on larger X-Ray targets in
full shot regime, while for smaller targets and for few-shot regime the
improvement is not visible. Remarkably, large networks pre-trained on very
large natural ImageNet-21k are as good or better than networks pre-trained on
largest available medical X-Ray data when performing transfer to large X-Ray
targets. We conclude that substantially increasing model and generic, medical
domain-agnostic natural image source data scale in the pre-training can enable
high quality out-of-domain transfer to medical domain specific targets,
removing dependency on large medical domain-specific source data often not
available in the practice.

standard cosmological $\Lambda$CDM model. There are currently two methods to
measure this dependence at redshift $z>0$, and that is equally important to
estimate the CMB temperature $T_0$ at the present epoch $z=0$. The first method
is based on the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect for a galaxy cluster. aThe second
method is based on the analysis of the populations of atomic and molecular
energy levels observed in the absorption spectra of quasars. This method allows
$T_{\rm CMB}(z)$ to be measured directly. We present new estimates of $T_{\rm
CMB}(z_i)$ in the redshift range $1.7\le z_i \le3.3$ based on the analysis of
excitation of the CO rotational levels and C\,{\sc i} fine-structure levels in
15 absorption systems. We take into account collisional excitation of CO and
C\,{\sc i} with hydrogen atoms and H$_2$ and radiative pumping of C\,{\sc i} by
the interstellar ultraviolet radiation. Applying this corrections leads to a
systematic decrease in the previously obtained estimates of $T_{\rm CMB}(z_i)$
(for some systems the magnitude of the effect is $\sim$10\%). Combining our
measurements with the measurements of $T_{\rm CMB}(z)$ in galaxy clusters we
have obtained a constraint on the parameter $\beta=+0.010\pm0.013$, which
characterizes the deviation of the CMB temperature from the standard relation,
$T_{\rm CMB} = T_0(1 + z)^{1-\beta}$, and an independent estimate of the CMB
temperature at the present epoch, $T_0 = 2.719\pm0.009$\,K, which agrees well

there has been a significant progress in understanding its many-server

converges to a $\mathrm{Gamma}(2,\beta)$ distribution. Both the transient and

  The \defn{box-complement} algorithm can solve the strong excluded-sums
problem in $\Theta(d N)$ time, asymptotically beating the state-of-the-art
corners algorithm by Demaine et al., which runs in $\Omega(2^d N)$ time. In 3

  The weak excluded-sums problem can be solved in $\Theta(d N)$ time by the
bidirectional box-sum complement (BDBSC) algorithm, which is a trivial
extension of the BDBS algorithm. Given an operator inverse $\ominus$, BDBSC can
beat box-complement by up to a factor of $4$.

Recently, deep clustering has become a major trend in clustering techniques.
Representation learning often plays an important role in the effectiveness of
deep clustering, and thus can be a principal cause of performance degradation.
In this paper, we propose a clustering-friendly representation learning method
using instance discrimination and feature decorrelation. Our
deep-learning-based representation learning method is motivated by the
properties of classical spectral clustering. Instance discrimination learns
similarities among data and feature decorrelation removes redundant correlation
among features. We utilize an instance discrimination method in which learning
individual instance classes leads to learning similarity among instances.
Through detailed experiments and examination, we show that the approach can be
adapted to learning a latent space for clustering. We design novel
softmax-formulated decorrelation constraints for learning. In evaluations of
image clustering using CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-10, our method achieves accuracy
of 81.5% and 95.4%, respectively. We also show that the softmax-formulated
constraints are compatible with various neural networks.

Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) exacerbates matters by
imposing various constraints on communication and observability. In this work,
we consider the fundamental hurdle affecting both value-based and
policy-gradient approaches: an exponential blowup of the action space with the
number of agents. For value-based methods, it poses challenges in accurately
representing the optimal value function. For policy gradient methods, it makes
training the critic difficult and exacerbates the problem of the lagging
critic. We show that from a learning theory perspective, both problems can be
addressed by accurately representing the associated action-value function with
a low-complexity hypothesis class. This requires accurately modelling the agent
interactions in a sample efficient way. To this end, we propose a novel
tensorised formulation of the Bellman equation. This gives rise to our method
Tesseract, which views the Q-function as a tensor whose modes correspond to the
action spaces of different agents. Algorithms derived from Tesseract decompose
the Q-tensor across agents and utilise low-rank tensor approximations to model
agent interactions relevant to the task. We provide PAC analysis for
Tesseract-based algorithms and highlight their relevance to the class of rich
observation MDPs. Empirical results in different domains confirm Tesseract's

solve the quantum measurement problem. Stochastic reformulations of quantum
mechanics based on spontaneous collapses of the wavefunction are a popular
approach to this issue. In this article, we derive the dynamic equations for
the four most important spontaneous collapse models - Ghirardi-Rimini-Weber
(GRW) theory, continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) model, Di\'osi-Penrose

master equations are approximated by Fokker-Planck equations. Moreover, we use
the phase-space form of GRW theory to test, via molecular dynamics simulations,
David Albert's suggestion that the stochasticity induced by spontaneous
collapses is responsible for the emergence of thermodynamic irreversibility.
The simulations show that, for initial conditions leading to anti-thermodynamic
behavior in the classical case, GRW-type perturbations do not lead to
thermodynamic behavior. Consequently, the GRW-based equilibration mechanism

integrated CMOS Schottky diodes to detect the signal power at a low bias
current. The approach dissipates low quiescent power and allows the reuse of
the design in multiple frequency bands with only modifying the matching
network. In the second phase, a data-locked startable oscillator is proposed to
correlate the received data with a target signature. This design eliminates the
area and power dissipation of an external crystal oscillator and only turns on
when the second phase is activated. By correlating to a target signature, the
second phase also reduces the probability of a false alarm (PFA) that would
otherwise wake up the high-power bulk of the system. The two-phase approach
leads to significant reduction in average power consumption when compared to a
single-phase design. This implementation targets sub-ms wake-up latency and

growing attention. Iterative reconstruction developed in Ref. [1] is a
technique designed to reconstruct the displacement field from the observed
galaxy distribution. The nonlinear displacement field and initial linear
density field are highly correlated. Therefore, reconstructing the nonlinear
displacement field enables us to extract the primordial cosmological
information better than from the late time density field at the level of the
two-point statistics. This paper will test to what extent the iterative
reconstruction can recover the true displacement field and construct a
perturbation theory model for the postreconstructed field. We model the
iterative reconstruction process with Lagrangian perturbation theory~(LPT) up
to third order for dark matter in real space and compare it with $N$-body
simulations. We find that the simulated iterative reconstruction does not
converge to the nonlinear displacement field, and the discrepancy mainly
appears in the shift term, i.e., the term correlated directly with the linear
density field. On the contrary, our 3LPT model predicts that the iterative
reconstruction should converge to the nonlinear displacement field. We discuss
the sources of discrepancy, including numerical noise/artifacts on small
scales, and present an ad hoc phenomenological model that improves the
agreement.

find any significant dependence of the disk radii and continuum fluxes on a
single parameter on the core scale, such as the non-thermal line width,
magnetic field orientation and strength, or magnitude and orientation of the
velocity gradient. Among these parameters, we only found a positive correlation
between the magnitude of the velocity gradient and the non-thermal line width.
Thus, the observed velocity gradients are more likely related to turbulent
motion but not large-scale rotation. Our results of no clear dependence of the
disk radii on these parameters are more consistent with the expectation from
non-ideal MHD simulations of disk formation in collapsing cores, where the disk
size is self-regulated by magnetic braking and diffusion, compared to other
simulations which only include turbulence and/or a magnetic field misaligned
with the rotational axis. Therefore, our results could hint that the non-ideal
MHD effects play a more important role in the disk formation. Nevertheless, we
cannot exclude the influences on the observed disk size distribution by
dynamical interaction in a stellar cluster or amounts of angular momentum on
the core scale, which cannot be probed with the current data.

combining systematic analyses of nuclear structure and reactions in a series of

$^{208}$Pb$(p,p)$ at $E_p=295$ MeV to obtain improved neutron densities and
radii from experimental cross section data. The reaction calculation is
performed according to the relativistic impulse approximation using the
modified Murdock and Horowitz model with density-dependent effective $NN$

given by the relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov and nonrelativistic Skyrme
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations and the experimental density extracted

structure properties such as $D(\rho_n)$ and $D(r_n)$ and the isotopic
cross-section ratio. By fitting $R(\sigma)$, the values of $D(\rho_n)$ and
$D(r_n)$ are extracted from the experimental $(p,p)$ cross section data with
less uncertainty of the structure and reaction models. The isotopic neutron
radius difference between $^{206}$Pb and $^{208}$Pb was obtained as
$D(r_n)=-0.012$ fm with an acceptable range of $D(r_n)=-0.03 \sim -0.006$ fm.

learning on the training data pairs leading to massive network parameters for
unnecessary physical model relearning which might not be consistent with the
governing physical models of the imaging system. Fusing the physical forward

distinguish the distribution of clean and noisy images. Leveraging such an
adversarial regularizer for parameterizing the distribution of latent images

deal with the existing signal processing problems in a data-driven manner via
digging the inherent characteristic from the real data. Hence, AI is
particularly suitable for the signal processing problems over RIS networks
under unideal scenarios like modeling mismatching, insufficient resource,
hardware impairment, as well as dynamical transmissions. As one of the earliest

various signal processing topics, including environmental sensing, channel

synchronized rhythms (SSRs) in a spiking neural network of the hippocampal
dentate gyrus (DG). The main encoding granule cells (GCs) are grouped into
lamellar clusters. In each GC cluster, there is one inhibitory (I) basket cell
(BC) along with excitatory (E) GCs, and they form the E-I loop. Winner-take-all
competition, leading to sparse activation of the GCs, occurs in each GC
cluster. Such sparsity has been thought to enhance pattern separation performed
in the DG. During the winner-take-all competition, SSRs are found to appear in
each population of the GCs and the BCs through interaction of excitation of the
GCs with inhibition of the BCs. Sparsely synchronized spiking stripes appear
successively with the population frequency $f_p~ (= 13$ Hz) in the raster plots
of spikes. We also note that excitatory hilar mossy cells (MCs) control the
firing activity of the GC-BC loop by providing excitation to both the GCs and
the BCs. SSR also appears in the population of MCs via interaction with the GCs
(i.e., GC-MC loop). Population behaviors in the SSRs are quantitatively
characterized in terms of the synchronization measures. In addition, we
investigate individual firing activity of GCs, BCs, and MCs in the SSRs.
Individual GCs exhibit random spike skipping, leading to a multi-peaked
inter-spike-interval histogram, which is well characterized in terms of the
random phase-locking degree. On the other hand, both BCs and MCs show
""intrastripe"" burstings within stripes, together with ""interstripe"" random
spike skipping. MC loss may occur during epileptogenesis. With decreasing the
fraction of the MCs, changes in the population and individual firings in the
SSRs are also studied. Finally, quantitative association between the
population/individual firing behaviors in the SSRs and the winner-take-all
competition is discussed.

is better than 16 ps for a charge larger than 15 fC with the sensor

corrected using the TOT measurement. The time resolution distribution has a
standard deviation of 29 ps after the time-walk correction from the charge

measured to be 0.74 mW and 1.53 mW per pixel in the low- and high-power mode,

few-shot segmentation as a semantic reconstruction problem, and convert base

suppress interference from other classes by projecting query features to the
support vector for precise semantic activation. Our proposed approach, referred

single-band light-curve classifier based on deep neural networks, and use
transfer learning to address the training data paucity problem by conveying
knowledge from one dataset to another. First we train a neural network on 16
variability features extracted from the light-curves of OGLE and EROS-2
variables. We then optimize this model using a small set (e.g. 5%) of periodic
variable light-curves from the ASAS dataset in order to transfer knowledge
inferred from OGLE/EROS-2 to a new ASAS classifier. With this we achieve good
classification results on ASAS, thereby showing that knowledge can be
successfully transferred between datasets. We demonstrate similar transfer
learning using Hipparcos and ASAS-SN data. We therefore find that it is not
necessary to train a neural network from scratch for every new survey, but
rather that transfer learning can be used even when only a small set of
labelled data is available in the new survey.

Similar to multi-hop question-answering (QA) systems, at each step, DocHopper
uses a query $q$ to attend to information from a document, combines this
``retrieved'' information with $q$ to produce the next query. However, in
contrast to most previous multi-hop QA systems, DocHopper is able to
``retrieve'' either short passages or long sections of the document, thus
emulating a multi-step process of ``navigating'' through a long document to
answer a question. To enable this novel behavior, DocHopper does not combine
document information with $q$ by concatenating text to the text of $q$, but by
combining a compact neural representation of $q$ with a compact neural
representation of a hierarchical part of the document, which can potentially be
quite large. We experiment with DocHopper on four different QA tasks that
require reading long and complex documents to answer multi-hop questions, and
show that DocHopper achieves state-of-the-art results on three of the datasets.
Additionally, DocHopper is efficient at inference time, being 3--10 times
faster than the baselines.

unlabeled data when labeled data is scarce. However, most SSL algorithms work
under the assumption that the class distributions are balanced in both training
and test sets. In this work, we consider the problem of SSL on class-imbalanced
data, which better reflects real-world situations. In particular, we decouple
the training of the representation and the classifier, and systematically
investigate the effects of different data re-sampling techniques when training
the whole network including a classifier as well as fine-tuning the feature
extractor only. We find that data re-sampling is of critical importance to
learn a good classifier as it increases the accuracy of the pseudo-labels, in
particular for the minority classes in the unlabeled data. Interestingly, we
find that accurate pseudo-labels do not help when training the feature
extractor, rather contrariwise, data re-sampling harms the training of the
feature extractor. This finding is against the general intuition that wrong
pseudo-labels always harm the model performance in SSL. Based on these
findings, we suggest to re-think the current paradigm of having a single data
re-sampling strategy and develop a simple yet highly effective Bi-Sampling
(BiS) strategy for SSL on class-imbalanced data. BiS implements two different
re-sampling strategies for training the feature extractor and the classifier
and integrates this decoupled training into an end-to-end framework. In
particular, BiS progressively changes the data distribution during training
such that in the beginning the feature extractor is trained effectively, while
towards the end of the training the data is re-balanced such that the

developing, analyzing, and mitigating epidemic spreading processes under human
decision-making. We provide a review of a range of epidemic models and explain
the pros and cons of different epidemic models. We exhibit the art of coupling
epidemic models and decision models in the existing literature. {More
specifically, we provide answers to fundamental questions in human
decision-making amid epidemics, including what interventions to take to combat
the disease, who are decision-makers, when to take interventions, and how to
make interventions.}
  Among many decision models, game-theoretic models have become increasingly
crucial in modeling human responses/behavior amid epidemics in the last decade.
In this review, we motivate the game-theoretic approach to human
decision-making amid epidemics. This review provides an overview of the
existing literature by developing a multi-dimensional taxonomy, which
categorizes existing literature based on multiple dimensions, including 1)
types of games, such as differential games, stochastic games, evolutionary
games, and static games; 2) types of interventions, such as social distancing,
vaccination, quarantine, taking antidotes, etc.; 3) the types of
decision-makers, such as individuals, adversaries, and central authorities at
different hierarchical levels. A fine-grained dynamic game framework is
proposed to capture the essence of game-theoretic decision-making amid
epidemics. We showcase three representative {frameworks} with unique ways of
integrating game-theoretic decision-making into the epidemic models from a vast
body of literature. {Each of the three framework has a unique way of modeling,
conducting analytical analysis, and deriving results.} In the end, we identify
several main open problems and research gaps left to be addressed and filled.

as a powerful tool for robust geometry processing of surface meshes, taking a
low-quality mesh and retriangulating it with high-quality intrinsic triangles.
However, existing representations either support only edge flips, or do not
offer a robust procedure to recover the common subdivision, that is, how the
intrinsic triangulation sits along the original surface. To build a
general-purpose robust structure, we extend the framework of normal
coordinates, which have been deeply studied in topology, as well as the more
recent idea of roundabouts from geometry processing, to support a variety of
mesh processing operations like vertex insertions, edge splits, etc. The basic
idea is to store an integer per mesh edge counting the number of times a curve
crosses that edge. We show that this paradigm offers a highly effective
representation for intrinsic triangulations with strong robustness guarantees.
The resulting data structure is general and efficient, while offering a
guarantee of always encoding a valid subdivision. Among other things, this
allows us to generate a high-quality intrinsic Delaunay refinement of all
manifold meshes in the challenging Thingi10k dataset for the first time. This
enables a broad class of existing surface geometry algorithms to be applied

leading to degraded test performance. Current methods usually use extensive
data augmentation to increase the batch size, but we found the performance gain
with data augmentation decreases as batch size increases, and data augmentation
will become insufficient after certain point. In this paper, we propose to use
adversarial learning to increase the batch size in large-batch training.
Despite being a natural choice for smoothing the decision surface and biasing
towards a flat region, adversarial learning has not been successfully applied
in large-batch training since it requires at least two sequential gradient
computations at each step, which will at least double the running time compared
with vanilla training even with a large number of processors. To overcome this
issue, we propose a novel Concurrent Adversarial Learning (ConAdv) method that
decouple the sequential gradient computations in adversarial learning by
utilizing staled parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that ConAdv can
successfully increase the batch size on ResNet-50 training on ImageNet while
maintaining high accuracy. In particular, we show ConAdv along can achieve
75.3\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet ResNet-50 training with 96K batch size, and
the accuracy can be further improved to 76.2\% when combining ConAdv with data

expected to have two key properties: It should be valid (guaranteeing coverage)
and discriminative (more uncertain when the expected risk is high). Moreover,
when combined with deep learning (DL) methods, it should be scalable and affect
the DL model performance minimally. Most existing Bayesian methods lack
frequentist coverage guarantees and usually affect model performance. The few
available frequentist methods are rarely discriminative and/or violate coverage
guarantees due to unrealistic assumptions. Moreover, many methods are expensive
or require substantial modifications to the base neural network. Building upon
recent advances in conformal prediction [13, 33] and leveraging the classical
idea of kernel regression, we propose Locally Valid and Discriminative
prediction intervals (LVD), a simple, efficient, and lightweight method to
construct discriminative prediction intervals (PIs) for almost any DL model.
With no assumptions on the data distribution, such PIs also offer finite-sample
local coverage guarantees (contrasted to the simpler marginal coverage). We
empirically verify, using diverse datasets, that besides being the only locally
valid method for DL, LVD also exceeds or matches the performance (including
coverage rate and prediction accuracy) of existing uncertainty quantification
methods, while offering additional benefits in scalability and flexibility.

major trouble regarding this class of PDEs concerns its mathematical nature,
which may be nonuniform over the domain. Due to the local degeneracy of the
diffusion term, it can be purely hyperbolic in a subregion and elliptic in the
rest. This problem is thus quite delicate to solve since the exact solution is
discontinuous at interfaces separating both elliptic and hyperbolic parts. The
proposed HDG method is developed in a unified and compact fashion. It can
efficiently handle pure diffusive or advective regimes and intermediate regimes
that combine the above mechanisms for a wide range of P\'eclet numbers,
including the delicate situation of local evanescent diffusion. To this end, an
adaptive stabilization strategy based on the addition of jump-penalty terms is
then considered. A $\theta$-upwind-based scheme is favored for the hyperbolic
region, and an inspired Scharfetter--Gummel-based technique is preferred for
the elliptic region. The well-posedness of the HDG method is also discussed by
analyzing the consistency and discrete coercivity properties. Extensive

between a locally excited state and ground state in free, massless fermionic
theory and free Yang-Mills theory in four spacetime dimensions. Capacity has
non-trivial time evolution and is sensitive to the partial entanglement
structure, and shows a universal peak at early times. We define a quantity, the
normalized ""Page time"", which measures the timescale when capacity reaches its
peak. This quantity turns out to be a characteristic property of the inserted
operator. This firmly establishes capacity as a valuable measure of
entanglement structure of an operator, especially at early times similar in
spirit to the Renyi entropies at late times. Interestingly, the time evolution
of capacity closely resembles its evolution in microcanonical and canonical
ensemble of the replica wormhole model in the context of the black hole
information paradox.

shear correction alone upon the local polarization results in a sign and

also discovered in other recent studies, it is mostly suppressed by the

NER transfers knowledge from a rich-resource language to languages with low
resources through pre-trained multilingual language models. Instead of using
training data in target languages, cross-lingual NER has to rely on only
training data in source languages, and optionally adds the translated training
data derived from source languages. However, the existing cross-lingual NER
methods do not make good use of rich unlabeled data in target languages, which
is relatively easy to collect in industry applications. To address the
opportunities and challenges, in this paper we describe our novel practice in
Microsoft to leverage such large amounts of unlabeled data in target languages
in real production settings. To effectively extract weak supervision signals
from the unlabeled data, we develop a novel approach based on the ideas of
semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning. The empirical study on
three benchmark data sets verifies that our approach establishes the new
state-of-the-art performance with clear edges. Now, the NER techniques reported

modeling (e.g., UML), where the notions of class and object form the primitive
building blocks of thought. Classes act as templates for objects that have
attributes and methods (actions). The modeled systems are not even necessarily
software systems: They can be human and artificial systems of many different
kinds (e.g., teaching and learning systems). The UML class diagram is described
as a central component of model-driven software development. It is the most
common diagram in object-oriented models and used to model the static design
view of a system. Objects both carry data and execute actions. According to
some authorities in modeling, a certain degree of difficulty exists in
understanding the semantics of these notions in UML class diagrams. Some
researchers claim class diagrams have limited use for conceptual analysis and
that they are best used for logical design. Performing conceptual analysis
should not concern the ways facts are grouped into structures. Whether a fact
will end up in the design as an attribute is not a conceptual issue. UML leads
to drilling down into physical design details (e.g., private/public attributes,
encapsulated operations, and navigating direction of an association). This
paper is a venture to further the understanding of object-orientated concepts
as exemplified in UML with the aim of developing a broad comprehension of
conceptual modeling fundamentals. Thinging machine (TM) modeling is a new
modeling language employed in such an undertaking. TM modeling interlaces
structure (components) and actionality where actions infiltrate the attributes
as much as the classes. Although space limitations affect some aspects of the
class diagram, the concluding assessment of this study reveals the class
description is a kind of shorthand for a richer sematic TM construct.

field test was implemented on the M3 generation of two mutant pea plants gained
from previous neutron radiation of pea seeds. The relationship between
agronomic characteristics and yields of the mutants was investigated. Moreover,
differences in physiological and biochemical properties and seed nutrients were
analyzed. The results demonstrated that the plant height, effective pods per
plant, and yield per plant of mutant Leaf-M1 were 45.0%, 43.2%, and 50.9%
higher than those of the control group. Further analysis attributed the
increase in yield per plant to the increased branching number. The yield per
plant of mutant Leaf-M2 was 7.8% higher than that of the control group, which
could be related with the increased chlorophyll content in the leaves. There
was a significant difference between the two mutants in the increase of yield
per plant owing to morphological variation between the two mutants. There were
significant differences in SOD activity and MDA content between the two mutants
and the control, indicating that the physiological regulation of the two
mutants also changed. In addition, the iron element content of seeds of the two
mutants were about 10.9% lower than in the seeds of the control group, a
significant difference. These findings indicate that the mutants Leaf-M1 and
Leaf-M2 have breeding value and material value for molecular biological
studies.

seriously vulnerable to malicious spoofing attacks, such as replay, synthetic

dedicated to defending ASV against replay and synthetic speech; however, only a
few approaches have been explored to deal with adversarial attacks. All the
existing approaches to tackle adversarial attacks for ASV require the knowledge
for adversarial samples generation, but it is impractical for defenders to know
the exact attack algorithms that are applied by the in-the-wild attackers. This
work is among the first to perform adversarial defense for ASV without knowing
the specific attack algorithms. Inspired by self-supervised learning models
(SSLMs) that possess the merits of alleviating the superficial noise in the
inputs and reconstructing clean samples from the interrupted ones, this work
regards adversarial perturbations as one kind of noise and conducts adversarial
defense for ASV by SSLMs. Specifically, we propose to perform adversarial
defense from two perspectives: 1) adversarial perturbation purification and 2)
adversarial perturbation detection. Experimental results show that our
detection module effectively shields the ASV by detecting adversarial samples
with an accuracy of around 80%. Moreover, since there is no common metric for
evaluating the adversarial defense performance for ASV, this work also
formalizes evaluation metrics for adversarial defense considering both
purification and detection based approaches into account. We sincerely
encourage future works to benchmark their approaches based on the proposed

paradigm in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) settings and
is widely used in many real applications. One of the major challenges in the
training process is credit assignment, which aims to deduce the contributions
of each agent according to the global rewards. Existing credit assignment
methods focus on either decomposing the joint value function into individual
value functions or measuring the impact of local observations and actions on
the global value function. These approaches lack a thorough consideration of
the complicated interactions among multiple agents, leading to an unsuitable
assignment of credit and subsequently mediocre results on MARL. We propose
Shapley Counterfactual Credit Assignment, a novel method for explicit credit
assignment which accounts for the coalition of agents. Specifically, Shapley
Value and its desired properties are leveraged in deep MARL to credit any
combinations of agents, which grants us the capability to estimate the
individual credit for each agent. Despite this capability, the main technical
difficulty lies in the computational complexity of Shapley Value who grows
factorially as the number of agents. We instead utilize an approximation method
via Monte Carlo sampling, which reduces the sample complexity while maintaining
its effectiveness. We evaluate our method on StarCraft II benchmarks across
different scenarios. Our method outperforms existing cooperative MARL
algorithms significantly and achieves the state-of-the-art, with especially
large margins on tasks with more severe difficulties.

for visual-inertial navigation systems is proposed with the goal of enabling
the improved deployment of such algorithms on computationally constrained
systems. Such a capacity can prove critical when employed on ultra-lightweight
systems or alongside mission critical computationally expensive processes. To
achieve this objective, the algorithm proposes selected changes in the vision
front-end and optimization back-end of visual-inertial odometry algorithms,
both prior to execution and in real-time based on an online profiling of
available resources. The method also utilizes information from the motion
dynamics experienced by the system to manipulate parameters online. The general
policy is demonstrated on three established algorithms, namely S-MSCKF,
VINS-Mono and OKVIS and has been verified experimentally on the EuRoC dataset.
The proposed approach achieved comparable performance at a fraction of the
original computational cost.

Positive Semidefinite (PSD) factorization of $X$ is a collection of $r \times
r$-dimensional PSD matrices $\{A_i\}$ and $\{B_j\}$ satisfying $X_{ij}=
\mathrm{tr}(A_i B_j)$ for all $\ i\in [m],\ j\in [n]$. PSD factorizations are
fundamentally linked to understanding the expressiveness of semidefinite
programs as well as the power and limitations of quantum resources in
information theory. The PSD factorization task generalizes the Non-negative
Matrix Factorization (NMF) problem where we seek a collection of
$r$-dimensional nonnegative vectors $\{a_i\}$ and $\{b_j\}$ satisfying $X_{ij}=
a_i^\top b_j$, for all $i\in [m],\ j\in [n]$ -- one can recover the latter
problem by choosing matrices in the PSD factorization to be diagonal. The most
widely used algorithm for computing NMFs of a matrix is the Multiplicative
Update algorithm developed by Lee and Seung, in which nonnegativity of the
updates is preserved by scaling with positive diagonal matrices. In this paper,
we describe a non-commutative extension of Lee-Seung's algorithm, which we call
the Matrix Multiplicative Update (MMU) algorithm, for computing PSD
factorizations. The MMU algorithm ensures that updates remain PSD by congruence
scaling with the matrix geometric mean of appropriate PSD matrices, and it
retains the simplicity of implementation that Lee-Seung's algorithm enjoys.
Building on the Majorization-Minimization framework, we show that under our
update scheme the squared loss objective is non-increasing and fixed points
correspond to critical points. The analysis relies on Lieb's Concavity Theorem.
Beyond PSD factorizations, we use the MMU algorithm as a primitive to calculate
block-diagonal PSD factorizations and tensor PSD factorizations. We demonstrate
the utility of our method with experiments on real and synthetic data.

consumption into itemised energy usage of individual appliances. In this way,
considerable energy savings could be achieved by enhancing household's
awareness of energy usage. Recent investigations have shown that deep neural
networks (DNNs) based approaches are promising for the NILM task. Nevertheless,
they normally ignore the inherent properties of appliance operations in the
network design, potentially leading to implausible results. We are thus
motivated to develop the dual Deep Neural Networks (dual-DNN), which aims to i)
take advantage of DNNs' learning capability of latent features and ii) empower
the DNN architecture with identification ability of universal properties.
Specifically in the design of dual-DNN, we adopt one subnetwork to measure
power ratings of different appliances' operation states, and the other
subnetwork to identify the running states of target appliances. The final
result is then obtained by multiplying these two network outputs and meanwhile
considering the multi-state property of household appliances. To enforce the
sparsity property in appliance's state operating, we employ median filtering
and hard gating mechanisms to the subnetwork for state identification. Compared
with the state-of-the-art NILM methods, our dual-DNN approach demonstrates a
21.67% performance improvement in average on two public benchmark datasets.

This paper thus investigates the throughput-outage scaling laws of cache-aided

On the other hand, when the equal-throughput assumption is not considered, we
show that the proposed double time-slot framework with appropriate link-level

medical testing, DNA sequencing, communication protocols, and many more. In
this paper, we study (i) a sparsity-constrained version of the problem, in
which the testing procedure is subjected to one of the following two
constraints: items are finitely divisible and thus may participate in at most
$\gamma$ tests; or tests are size-constrained to pool no more than $\rho$ items
per test; and (ii) a noisy version of the problem, where each test outcome is
independently flipped with some constant probability. Under each of these
settings, considering the for-each recovery guarantee with asymptotically
vanishing error probability, we introduce a fast splitting algorithm and
establish its near-optimality not only in terms of the number of tests, but

develop solutions, software or even ideas. Hackathons have been recognized not
only as public events for hacking, but also as a corporate mechanism for
innovation. Hackathons are a way for established companies to achieve increased
employee wellbeing as well as being a curator for innovation and developing new
products. Sudden transition to the work-from-home mode caused by the COVID-19
pandemic first put many corporate events requiring collocation, such as
hackathons, temporarily on hold and then motivated companies to find ways to
hold these events virtually. In this paper, we report our findings from
investigating hackathons in the context of a large agile company by first
exploring the general benefits and challenges of hackathons and then trying to
understand how they were affected by the virtual setup. We conducted nine
interviews, surveyed 23 employees and analyzed a hackathon demo. We found that
hackathons provide both individual and organizational benefits of innovation,
personal interests, and acquiring new skills and competences. Several
challenges such as added stress due to stopping the regular work, employees
fearing not having enough contribution to deliver and potential mismatch
between individual and organizational goals were also found. With respect to
the virtual setup, we found that virtual hackathons are not diminishing the
innovation benefits, however, some negative effect surfaced on the social and
networking side.

on first imputing as well as possible and second learning on the completed data

grounding. Here we show that for almost all imputation functions, an
impute-then-regress procedure with a powerful learner is Bayes optimal. This
result holds for all missing-values mechanisms, in contrast with the classic
statistical results that require missing-at-random settings to use imputation
in probabilistic modeling. Moreover, it implies that perfect conditional
imputation is not needed for good prediction asymptotically. In fact, we show
that on perfectly imputed data the best regression function will generally be
discontinuous, which makes it hard to learn. Crafting instead the imputation so
as to leave the regression function unchanged simply shifts the problem to
learning discontinuous imputations. Rather, we suggest that it is easier to
learn imputation and regression jointly. We propose such a procedure, adapting
NeuMiss, a neural network capturing the conditional links across observed and
unobserved variables whatever the missing-value pattern. Experiments confirm
that joint imputation and regression through NeuMiss is better than various two
step procedures in our experiments with finite number of samples.

an item, plays a crucial role in online advertising and recommender system.
Feature interaction modeling based and user interest mining based methods are
the two kinds of most popular techniques that have been extensively explored
for many years and have made great progress for CTR prediction. However, (1)
feature interaction based methods which rely heavily on the co-occurrence of
different features, may suffer from the feature sparsity problem (i.e., many
features appear few times); (2) user interest mining based methods which need
rich user behaviors to obtain user's diverse interests, are easy to encounter
the behavior sparsity problem (i.e., many users have very short behavior
sequences). To solve these problems, we propose a novel module named Dual Graph
enhanced Embedding, which is compatible with various CTR prediction models to
alleviate these two problems. We further propose a Dual Graph enhanced
Embedding Neural Network (DG-ENN) for CTR prediction. Dual Graph enhanced
Embedding exploits the strengths of graph representation with two carefully
designed learning strategies (divide-and-conquer, curriculum-learning-inspired
organized learning) to refine the embedding. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on three real-world industrial datasets. The experimental results
show that our proposed DG-ENN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art CTR
prediction models. Moreover, when applying to state-of-the-art CTR prediction
models, Dual graph enhanced embedding always obtains better performance.
Further case studies prove that our proposed dual graph enhanced embedding
could alleviate the feature sparsity and behavior sparsity problems. Our
framework will be open-source based on MindSpore in the near future.

of the underlying alphabet is a natural move towards a computational treatment
of the language accepted by the automaton. Along this path, Wheeler
\emph{graphs} have been recently introduced as an extension/adaptation of the
Burrows-Wheeler Transform (the now famous BWT, originally defined on strings)
to graphs. These graphs constitute an important data-structure for languages,
since they allow a very efficient storage mechanism for the transition function
of an automaton, while providing a fast support to all sorts of substring
queries. This is possible as a consequence of a property -- the so-called
\emph{path coherence} -- valid on Wheeler graphs and consisting in an ordering
on nodes that ""propagates"" to (collections of) strings. By looking at a Wheeler
graph as an automaton, the ordering on strings corresponds to the
co-lexicographic order of the words entering each state. This leads naturally
to consider the class of regular languages accepted by Wheeler automata, i.e.
the Wheeler languages.
  It has been shown that, as opposed to the general case, the classic
determinization by powerset construction is polynomial on Wheeler languages. As
a consequence, most of the classical problems turn out to be ""easy"" -- that is,
solvable in polynomial time -- on Wheeler languages. Moreover, deciding whether
a DFA is Wheeler and deciding whether a DFA accepts a Wheeler language is
polynomial.
  Our contribution here is to put an upper bound to easy problems. For
instance, whenever we generalize by switching to general NFAs or by not fixing
an order of the underlying alphabet, the above mentioned problems become ""hard""

outcome-dependent payment scheme (a.k.a. contract) so as to induce an agent to
take a costly, unobservable action. We relax the assumption that the principal
perfectly knows the agent by considering a Bayesian setting where the agent's
type is unknown and randomly selected according to a given probability
distribution, which is known to the principal. Each agent's type is
characterized by her own action costs and action-outcome distributions. In the
literature on non-Bayesian principal-agent problems, considerable attention has
been devoted to linear contracts, which are simple, pure-commission payment
schemes that still provide nice approximation guarantees with respect to
principal-optimal (possibly non-linear) contracts. While in non-Bayesian
settings an optimal contract can be computed efficiently, this is no longer the
case for our Bayesian principal-agent problems. This further motivates our
focus on linear contracts, which can be optimized efficiently given their
single-parameter nature. Our goal is to analyze the properties of linear
contracts in Bayesian settings, in terms of approximation guarantees with
respect to optimal contracts and general tractable contracts (i.e.,
efficiently-computable ones). First, we study the approximation guarantees of
linear contracts with respect to optimal ones, showing that the former suffer
from a multiplicative loss linear in the number of agent's types. Nevertheless,
we prove that linear contracts can still provide a constant multiplicative
approximation $\rho$ of the optimal principal's expected utility, though at the
expense of an exponentially-small additive loss $2^{-\Omega(\rho)}$. Then, we
switch to tractable contracts, showing that, surprisingly, linear contracts
perform well among them.

persistent memory by placing NVM on the memory bus for CPU to directly load and
store data. As a result, cache-friendly data structures have been developed for
NVM. One of them is the prevalent B+-tree. State-of-the-art in-NVM B+-trees
mainly focus on the optimization of write operations (insertion and deletion).
However, search is of vital importance for B+-tree. Not only search-intensive
workloads benefit from an optimized search, but insertion and deletion also
rely on a preceding search operation to proceed. In this paper, we attentively
study a sorted B+-tree node that spans over contiguous cache lines. Such cache
lines exhibit a monotonically increasing trend and searching a target key
across them can be accelerated by estimating a range the key falls into. To do
so, we construct a probing Sentinel Array in which a sentinel stands for each
cache line of B+-tree node. Checking the Sentinel Array avoids scanning
unnecessary cache lines and hence significantly reduces cache misses for a
search. A quantitative evaluation shows that using Sentinel Arrays boosts the
search performance of state-of-the-art in-NVM B+-trees by up to 48.4% while the

no overlap, a setting that has been referred to as tele-registration. Our
technique is based on a novel neural network design that learns a prior of a
class of shapes and can complete a partial shape. The key idea is combining the
registration and completion tasks in a way that reinforces each other. In
particular, we simultaneously train the registration network and completion
network using two coupled flows, one that register-and-complete, and one that
complete-and-register, and encourage the two flows to produce a consistent
result. We show that, compared with each separate flow, this two-flow training
leads to robust and reliable tele-registration, and hence to a better point
cloud prediction that completes the registered scans. It is also worth
mentioning that each of the components in our neural network outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both completion and registration. We further
analyze our network with several ablation studies and demonstrate its
performance on a large number of partial point clouds, both synthetic and
real-world, that have only small or no overlap.

ultra-relativistic partially stripped ions (PSI) stored in circular

in the ions is achieved through Doppler-boosting (by twice the Lorentz factor;
from hundred to several thousand times) of light energy. In order to
efficiently excite the ions, and hence generate intense beams of
scattered/fluorescent photons, a detailed knowledge of the ions' electronic
energy structure and the dynamics of optical excitation is required.
Spectroscopic properties of PSI selected for the GF operation, as well as their
optical excitation schemes, are investigated. Two regimes of the ion--light
interaction are identified, leading to different dynamics of the excitation.
The efficiency of the ion--light interaction, as well as the number of photons
emitted from a single ion bunch, are estimated, both analytically and
numerically, for three ions considered for the GF, i.e.~Li-like

$\pi$-property. We note that it is still unknown if the $\pi$-property is
isomorphically equivalent to the existence of an FDD. For dual Banach spaces
this is true, so our results lead in particular to a characterization of the
FDD property for dual Banach spaces $X$ in terms of the existence of Lipschitz
retractions onto small generating convex and compact subsets of $X$. It is
conceivable that our results will find applications in the area of Lipschitz
isomorphisms of Banach spaces. Our arguments make critical use of the
Lipschitzization of coarse Lipschitz mappings due to J. Bourgain, and of an

the concept of mean objective cost of uncertainty (MOCU), which provides
effective means of quantifying the impact of uncertainty on the operational
goals at hand. MOCU is especially useful for optimal experimental design (OED)
as the potential efficacy of an experimental (or data acquisition) campaign can
be quantified by estimating the MOCU that is expected to remain after the

limits its practical applicability. In this paper, we propose a novel machine
learning (ML) scheme that can significantly accelerate MOCU computation and
expedite MOCU-based experimental design. The main idea is to use an ML model to
efficiently search for the optimal robust operator under model uncertainty, a
necessary step for computing MOCU. We apply the proposed ML-based OED
acceleration scheme to design experiments aimed at optimally enhancing the
control performance of uncertain Kuramoto oscillator models. Our results show
that the proposed scheme results in up to 154-fold speed improvement without

extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range is still in its infancy. In this
contribution a significant advance is presented based on a Michelson-type
all-reflective split-and-delay autocorrelator operating in a quasi amplitude
splitting mode. The autocorrelator works under a grazing incidence angle in a
broad spectral range $\mathrm{(10\,nm - 1\,\mu m)}$ providing collinear
propagation of both pulse replicas and thus a constant phase difference across
the beam profile. The compact instrument allows for XUV pulse autocorrelation
measurements in the time domain with a single-digit attosecond precision
resulting in a resolution of $\mathrm{E/\Delta E=2000}$. Its performance for
spectroscopic applications is demonstrated by characterizing a very sharp
electronic transition at $\mathrm{26.6\,eV}$ in Ar gas induced by the
$\mathrm{11^{th}}$ harmonic of a frequency-doubled Yb-fiber laser leading to
the characteristic $\mathrm{3s3p^{6}4p^{1}P^{1}}$ Fano-resonance of Ar atoms.
We benchmark our time-domain interferometry results with a high-resolution XUV
grating spectrometer and find an excellent agreement. The common-path
interferometer opens up new opportunities for short-wavelength femtosecond and
attosecond pulse metrology and dynamic studies on extreme time scales in
various research fields.

manually annotate a word-internal structure treebank (WIST) consisting of over
30K multi-char words from Chinese Penn Treebank. To guarantee quality, each

handled by a third senior annotator. Second, we present detailed and

Third, we propose word-internal structure parsing as a new task, and conduct
benchmark experiments using a competitive dependency parser. Finally, we
present two simple ways to encode word-internal structures, leading to
promising gains on the sentence-level syntactic parsing task.

Then, we contact developers to verify our manual study result. We integrated

studied systems and three additional systems. In total, combining the results
of DLFinder and our manual analysis, we reported 91 problematic duplicate

further study the relationship between duplicate logging statements, including
the problematic instances of duplicate logging code smells, and code clones. We
find that 83% of the duplicate logging code smell instances reside in cloned
code, but 17% of them reside in micro-clones that are difficult to detect using
automated clone detection tools. We also find that more than half of the

portion of them reside in very short code blocks which may not be effectively
detected by existing code clone detection tools. Our study shows that, in
addition to general source code that implements the business logic, code clones
may also result in bad logging practices that could increase maintenance

plate capacitor. To further reduce the qubit footprint, we place one of the
qubit pads and a single Josephson junction on the bottom chip and the other pad
on the top chip which is galvanically connected with the single Josephson
junction through an indium bump. The electric field participation ratio can
arrive at nearly 53% in air when the vacuum-gap is about 5 microns, and thus
potentially leading to a lower dielectric loss. The coherence times of the
flipmons are measured in the range of 30-60 microseconds, which are comparable
with that of traditional transmons with similar fabrication processes. The
electric field simulation indicates that the metal-air interface's
participation ratio increases significantly and may dominate the qubit's
decoherence. This suggests that more careful surface treatment needs to be
considered. No evidence shows that the indium bumps inside the flipmons cause
significant decoherence. With well-designed geometry and good surface
treatment, the coherence of the flipmons can be further improved.

correctness properties. A compromise is to allow multiple consistency levels to
coexist in the data store. In this paper we present UniStore, the first
fault-tolerant and scalable data store that combines causal and strong
consistency. The key challenge we address in UniStore is to maintain liveness
despite data center failures: this could be compromised if a strong transaction
takes a dependency on a causal transaction that is later lost because of a
failure. UniStore ensures that such situations do not arise while paying the
cost of durability for causal transactions only when necessary. We evaluate
UniStore on Amazon EC2 using both microbenchmarks and a sample application. Our
results show that UniStore effectively and scalably combines causal and strong

under the effect of strong magnetic fields. As already predicted from a
calculation of the unstable modes resulting from density fluctuations at
subsaturation densities, we confirm in the present work that for magnetic field
intensities of the order of $\approx 5 \times 10^{16}$ G to $5 \times 10^{17}$
G, pasta phases may occur for densities well above the zero-field crust-core
transition density. This confirms that the extension of the crust may be larger
than expected. It is also verified that the equilibrium structure of the
clusterized matter is very sensitive to the intensity of the magnetic fields.
As a result, the decay of the magnetic field may give rise to internal stresses
which may result on the yield and fracture of the inner crust lattice.

  Historical Database",,,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In this paper, we analyze the effect of transport infrastructure investments
in railways. As a testing ground, we use data from a new historical database
that includes annual panel data on approximately 2,400 Swedish rural
geographical areas during the period 1860-1917. We use a staggered event study
design that is robust to treatment effect heterogeneity. Importantly, we find
extremely large reduced-form effects of having access to railways. For real
nonagricultural income, the cumulative treatment effect is approximately 120%
after 30 years. Equally important, we also show that our reduced-form effect is
likely to reflect growth rather than a reorganization of existing economic
activity since we find no spillover effects between treated and untreated
regions. Specifically, our results are consistent with the big push hypothesis,
which argues that simultaneous/coordinated investment, such as large
infrastructure investment in railways, can generate economic growth if there
are strong aggregate demand externalities (e.g., Murphy et al. 1989). We used
plant-level data to further corroborate this mechanism. Indeed, we find that
investments in local railways dramatically, and independent of initial
conditions, increase local industrial production and employment on the order of
100-300% across almost all industrial sectors.

holographically dual to $O(N)$ vector models. In contrast to other approaches
to bulk reconstruction, bilocal holography does not take input from the dual
gravitational theory. The resulting map is a complete bulk/boundary mapping in
that it maps the complete set of $O(N)$ invariant degrees of freedom in the
CFT, to the complete set of higher spin degrees of freedom. After restricting
to a suitable code subspace we demonstrate that bilocal holography naturally
reproduces the quantum error correcting properties of holography and it gives a
robust bulk (entanglement wedge) reconstruction. A gauge invariant entangled
pair of CFT degrees of freedom are naturally smeared over a semicircle in the
bulk spacetime, which is highly suggestive of bit threads. Finally, we argue
that finite $N$ relations in the CFT, when interpreted in the dual AdS
spacetime, can provide relations between degrees of freedom located near the
boundary and degrees of freedom deep in the bulk.

society with a weighted voting system where eligible voters received votes in
proportion to their taxable income and without any limit on the maximum of
votes, i.e., the political system used in Swedish local governments during the
period 1862-1909. We use a novel identification strategy where we combine two
different identification strategies, i.e., a threshold regression analysis and
a generalized event-study design, both of which exploit nonlinearities or
discontinuities in the effect of political power between two opposing local
elites: agricultural landowners and emerging industrialists. The results
suggest that school spending is approximately 90-120% higher if the nonagrarian
interest controls all of the votes compared to when landowners have more than a
majority of votes. Moreover, we find no evidence that the concentration of
landownership affected this relationship

show a near-unity, but negative circular polarization. Significantly, by
breaking time-reversal symmetry with an out-of-plane magnetic field, a record

the production of $\Xi^-$ hyperons off these nuclei at laboratory angles $\le$
45$^{\circ}$ by $K^-$ mesons with momenta of 1.0 and 1.3 GeV/c, which are close
to the threshold momentum (1.05 GeV/c) for $\Xi^-$ hyperon production on the

transparency ratio for the $^{184}$W/$^{12}$C combination for $\Xi^-$ hyperons
at these $K^-$ beam momenta. We show that the $\Xi^-$ differential and total
(absolute and relative) production cross sections at the considered initial
momenta reveal a distinct sensitivity to the variations in the scalar $\Xi^-$
nuclear potential at saturation density $\rho_0$, studied in the paper, in the
low-momentum region of 0.1--0.6 GeV/c. We also demonstrate that for the
subthreshold $K^-$ meson momentum of 1.0 GeV/c there is a strong sensitivity of
the transparency ratio for $\Xi^-$ hyperons to the considered changes in the
$\Xi^-$ nuclear potential at all outgoing $\Xi^-$ momenta as well. Therefore,
the measurement of these absolute and relative observables in a dedicated
experiment at the J-PARC will provide valuable information on the $\Xi^-$
in-medium properties, which will be complementary to that deduced from the
study of the inclusive ($K^-$,$K^+$) reactions at incident momenta of 1.6--1.8

of future case numbers is human mobility; however, research on the predictive
power of mobility is lacking. To fill this gap, we introduce a novel model for
epidemic forecasting based on mobility data, called mobility marked Hawkes
model. The proposed model consists of three components: (1) A Hawkes process
captures the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. (2) A mark modulates
the rate of infections, thus accounting for how the reproduction number R
varies across space and time. The mark is modeled using a regularized Poisson
regression based on mobility covariates. (3) A correction procedure
incorporates new cases seeded by people traveling between regions. Our model
was evaluated on the COVID-19 epidemic in Switzerland. Specifically, we used
mobility data from February through April 2020, amounting to approximately 1.5
billion trips. Trip counts were derived from large-scale telecommunication
data, i.e., cell phone pings from the Swisscom network, the largest
telecommunication provider in Switzerland. We compared our model against
various state-of-the-art baselines in terms of out-of-sample root mean squared
error. We found that our model outperformed the baselines by 15.52%. The
improvement was consistently achieved across different forecast horizons
between 5 and 21 days. In addition, we assessed the predictive power of
conventional point of interest data, confirming that telecommunication data is
superior. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to predict the
spread of COVID-19 from telecommunication data. Altogether, our work
contributes to previous research by developing a scalable early warning system

objective of the PCP has a min-max structure which could lead to many symmetric

topological phases, possessing symmetry-protected corner states with fractional
charges. An unexpected connection between these states and the seemingly
unrelated phenomenon of bound states in the continuum (BICs) was recently
unveiled. When nonlinearity is added to a HOTI system, a number of
fundamentally important questions arise. For example, how does nonlinearity
couple higher-order topological BICs with the rest of the system, including
continuum states? In fact, thus far BICs in nonlinear HOTIs have remained
unexplored. Here, we demonstrate the interplay of nonlinearity, higher-order
topology, and BICs in a photonic platform. We observe topological corner states
which, serendipitously, are also BICs in a laser-written second-order
topological lattice. We further demonstrate nonlinear coupling with edge states
at a low nonlinearity, transitioning to solitons at a high nonlinearity.
Theoretically, we calculate the analog of the Zak phase in the nonlinear
regime, illustrating that a topological BIC can be actively tuned by both
focusing and defocusing nonlinearities. Our studies are applicable to other
nonlinear HOTI systems, with promising applications in emerging topology-driven
devices.

spinning field to two scalars in $\left(d+1\right)$-dimensional de Sitter
space. Gauge invariance of observables with external (partially)-massless
spinning fields translates into Ward-Takahashi identities on the boundary.
Using the Mellin-Barnes representation for boundary correlators in momentum
space, we give a systematic study of Ward-Takahashi identities for tree-level
3- and 4-point processes involving a single external (partially-)massless field
of arbitrary integer spin-$J$. 3-point Ward-Takahashi identities constrain the
mass of the scalar fields to which a (partially-)massless spin-$J$ field can
couple. 4-point Ward-Takahashi identities then constrain the corresponding
cubic couplings. For massless spinning fields, we show that Weinberg's flat
space results carry over to $\left(d+1\right)$-dimensional de Sitter space: For
spins $J=1,2$ gauge-invariance implies charge-conservation and the equivalence
principle while, assuming locality, higher-spins $J>2$ cannot couple
consistently to scalar matter. This result also applies to anti-de Sitter
space. For partially-massless fields, restricting for simplicity to those of
depth-2, we show that there is no consistent coupling to scalar matter in local
theories. Along the way we give a detailed account of how contact amplitudes
with and without derivatives are represented in the Mellin-Barnes
representation. Various new explicit expressions for 3- and 4-point functions
involving (partially-)massless fields and conformally coupled scalars in dS$_4$
are given.

physical layer strategy for 6G. Motivated by ever increasing popularity of
cache-enabled content delivery in wireless communications, this paper proposes
an innovative multigroup multicast transmission scheme based on RSMA for
cache-aided cloud-radio access networks (C-RAN). Our proposed scheme not only
exploits the properties of content-centric communications and local caching at
the base stations (BSs), but also incorporates RSMA to better manage
interference in multigroup multicast transmission with statistical channel
state information (CSI) known at the central processor (CP) and the BSs. At the
RSMA-enabled cloud CP, the message of each multicast group is split into a
private and a common part with the former private part being decoded by all
users in the respective group and the latter common part being decoded by
multiple users from other multicast groups. Common message decoding is done for
the purpose of mitigating the interference. In this work, we jointly optimize
the clustering of BSs and the precoding with the aim of maximizing the minimum
rate among all multicast groups to guarantee fairness serving all groups. The
problem is a mixed-integer non-linear stochastic program (MINLSP), which is
solved by a practical algorithm we proposed including a heuristic clustering
algorithm for assigning a set of BSs to serve each user followed by an
efficient iterative algorithm that combines the sample average approximation
(SAA) and weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) to solve the stochastic
non-convex sub-problem of precoder design. Numerical results show the explicit
max-min rate gain of our proposed transmission scheme compared to the
state-of-the-art trivial interference processing methods. Therefore, we
conclude that RSMA is a promising technique for cache-aided C-RAN.

approaches based on visual localisation and LiDAR. While LiDAR provides
important depth information, it is sparse in resolution and expensive. On the
other hand, cameras are low-cost and recent developments in deep learning mean
they can provide high localisation performance. However, several fundamental
problems remain, particularly in the domain of uncertainty, where learning
based approaches can be notoriously over-confident.
  Markov, or grid-based, localisation was an early solution to the localisation
problem but fell out of favour due to its computational complexity.
Representing the likelihood field as a grid (or volume) means there is a trade
off between accuracy and memory size. Furthermore, it is necessary to perform
expensive convolutions across the entire likelihood volume. Despite the benefit
of simultaneously maintaining a likelihood for all possible locations, grid
based approaches were superseded by more efficient particle filters and Monte
Carlo Localisation (MCL). However, MCL introduces its own problems e.g.
particle deprivation.
  Recent advances in deep learning hardware allow large likelihood volumes to
be stored directly on the GPU, along with the hardware necessary to efficiently
perform GPU-bound 3D convolutions and this obviates many of the disadvantages
of grid based methods. In this work, we present a novel CNN-based localisation
approach that can leverage modern deep learning hardware. By implementing a
grid-based Markov localisation approach directly on the GPU, we create a hybrid
CNN that can perform image-based localisation and odometry-based likelihood
propagation within a single neural network. The resulting approach is capable
of outperforming direct pose regression methods as well as state-of-the-art
localisation systems.

the harmonic spectrum is reflected in the photon number distribution of the

using high harmonics produced by the interaction of strong laser pulses with

as well as, improved FT routing schemes. For a given $n$-vertex graph $G$ and a
bound $f$ on the number of faults, an $f$-FT connectivity labeling scheme is a
distributed data structure that assigns each of the graph edges and vertices a
short label, such that given the labels of the vertices $s$ and $t$, and at
most $f$ failing edges $F$, one can determine if $s$ and $t$ are connected in
$G \setminus F$. The primary complexity measure is the length of the individual
labels. Since their introduction by [Courcelle, Twigg, STACS '07], compact FT
labeling schemes have been devised only for a limited collection of graph
families. In this work, we fill in this gap by proposing two (independent) FT
connectivity labeling schemes for general graphs, with a nearly optimal label
length. This serves the basis for providing also FT approximate distance
labeling schemes, and ultimately also routing schemes. Our main results for an
$n$-vertex graph and a fault bound $f$ are:
  -- There is a randomized FT connectivity labeling scheme with a label length
of $O(f+\log n)$ bits, hence optimal for $f=O(\log n)$. This scheme is based on
the notion of cycle space sampling [Pritchard, Thurimella, TALG '11].
  -- There is a randomized FT connectivity labeling scheme with a label length
of $O(\log^3 n)$ bits (independent of the number of faults $f$). This scheme is
based on the notion of linear sketches of [Ahn et al., SODA '12].
  -- For $k\geq 1$, there is a randomized routing scheme that routes a message
from $s$ to $t$ in the presence of a set $F$ of faulty edges, with stretch
$O(|F|^2 k)$ and routing tables of size $\tilde{O}(f^3 n^{1/k})$.
  This significantly improves over the state-of-the-art bounds by [Chechik,

schemes for general graphs.

This yielded spatial resolutions of 18"" and 1.5"" for the two configurations,

in COVID-19 research, belong to a certain sub-class of compartmental models
whose classes may be divided into three ""(x, y, z)"" groups, which we will call
respectively ""susceptible/entrance, diseased, and output"" (in the classic SIR
case, there is only one class of each type). Roughly, the ODE dynamics of these
models contain only linear terms, with the exception of products between x and
y terms. It has long been noticed that the basic reproduction number R has a
very simple formula (3.3) in terms of the matrices which define the model, and
an explicit first integral formula (3.8) is also available. These results can
be traced back at least to [ABvdD+07] and [Fen07], respectively, and may be
viewed as the ""basic laws of SIR-type epidemics""; however many papers continue
to reprove them in particular instances (by the next-generation matrix method
or by direct computations, which are unnecessary). This motivated us to redraw
the attention to these basic laws and provide a self-contained reference of
related formulas for (x, y, z) models. We propose to rebaptize the class to
which they apply as matrix SIR epidemic models, abbreviated as SYR, to
emphasize the similarity to the classic SIR case. For the case of one
susceptible class, we propose to use the name SIR-PH, due to a simple
probabilistic interpretation as SIR models where the exponential infection time
has been replaced by a PH-type distribution. We note that to each SIR-PH model,
one may associate a scalar quantity Y(t) which satisfies ""classic SIR
relations"", see (3.8). In the case of several susceptible classes, this
generalizes to (5.10); in a future paper, we will show that (3.8), (5.10) may
be used to obtain approximate control policies which compare well with the

a range of medical conditions from anaemia to liver disease. Currently this is
done manually, a time-consuming and subjective process. This paper presents an
automated process utilising the advantages of machine learning to increase
capacity and standardisation of cell abnormality detection, and its performance
is analysed. Three different machine learning technologies were used: a Support
Vector Machine (SVM), a classical machine learning technology; TabNet, a deep
learning architecture for tabular data; U-Net, a semantic segmentation network
designed for medical image segmentation. A critical issue was the highly
imbalanced nature of the dataset which impacts the efficacy of machine
learning. To address this, synthesising minority class samples in feature space
was investigated via Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and
cost-sensitive learning. A combination of these two methods is investigated to
improve the overall performance. These strategies were found to increase
sensitivity to minority classes. The impact of unknown cells on semantic
segmentation is demonstrated, with some evidence of the model applying learning
of labelled cells to these anonymous cells. These findings indicate both
classical models and new deep learning networks as promising methods in

the context of multisensor data fusion. Differences in processing intervals and
other factors typically lead to a relative delay between measurement updates
from disparate sensors. Correct (optimal) data fusion demands that the relative
delay must either be known in advance or identified online. There have been
several recent proposals in the literature to determine the delay using
recursive, causal filters such as the extended Kalman filter (EKF). We
carefully review this formulation and show that there are fundamental issues
with the structure of the EKF (and related algorithms) when the delay is
included in the filter state vector as a parameter to be estimated. These
structural issues, in turn, leave recursive filters prone to bias and
inconsistency. Our theoretical analysis is supported by simulation studies that
demonstrate the implications in terms of filter performance; although tuning of
the filter noise variances may reduce the chance of inconsistency or
divergence, the underlying structural concerns remain. We offer brief
suggestions for ways to maintain the computational efficiency of recursive
filtering for temporal calibration while avoiding the drawbacks of the standard
filtering algorithms.

merger rate at redshift $z\geq 1$, where the optical depth for lensing is high.
It is commonly assumed that the merger rate of the astrophysical compact
objects is closely connected with the star formation rate, which peaks around
redshift $z\sim 2$. However, a major source of uncertainty is the delay time
between the formation and merger of compact objects. We explore the impact of
delay time on the lensing event rate. We show that as the delay time increases,
the peak of the merger rate of gravitational wave sources gets deferred to a
lower redshift. This leads to a reduction in the event rate of the lensed
events which are detectable by the gravitational wave detectors. We show that
for a delay time of around $10$ Gyr or larger, the lensed event rate can be
less than one per year for the design sensitivity of LIGO/Virgo. We also
estimate the merger rate for lensed sub-threshold for different delay time
scenarios, finding that for larger delay times the number of lensed
sub-threshold events is reduced, whereas for small-delay time models they are
significantly more frequent. This analysis shows for the first time that
lensing is a complementary probe to explore different formation channels of
binary systems by exploiting the lensing event rate from the well-detected
events and sub-threshold events which are measurable using the network of
gravitational wave detectors.

The game is played over rounds, and in each round all players simultaneously
choose a color from a set of available colors. Players have local information

continuous-domain functions that lie in an SI subspace spanned by the integer
shifts of the box function. The signal is modeled by an arbitrary SI generator
whose special case is the box function, which, as we show in the paper, is
conventionally used in single-pixel imaging. We propose to use separable
B-spline generators which are intuitively complemented by sparsity-inducing
spline wavelets. The SI models of the acquisition and the underlying signal
lead to an exact discretization of an inherently continuous-domain inverse
problem to a finite-dimensional problem of CS type. By solving the CS
optimization problem, a parametric representation of the signal is obtained.
Such a representation offers many practical advantages in image processing
applications. We propose an efficient matrix-free implementation of the
framework and conduct it on the standard test images and real-world measurement
data. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a
significant improvement of the reconstruction quality relative to the

disciplines such as Social sciences and Ecology for decades. So far, NA has not
been used extensively in studies of medication use. Only a handful of papers
have used NA in Drug Prescription Networks (DPN). We provide an introduction to
NA terminology alongside a guide to creating and extracting results from the
medication networks. Objective: To introduce the readers to NA as a tool to
study medication use by demonstrating how to apply different NA measures on 3
generated medication networks. Methods: We used the Norwegian Prescription
Database (NorPD) to create a network that describes the co-medication in
elderly persons in Norway on January 1, 2013. We used the Norwegian Electronic
Prescription Support System (FEST) to create another network of severe
drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Lastly, we created a network combining the two
networks to show the actual use of drugs with severe DDIs. We used these
networks to elucidate how to apply and interpret different network measures in
medication networks. Results: Interactive network graphs are made available
online, Stata and R syntaxes are provided. Various useful network measures for
medication networks were applied such as network topological features,
modularity analysis and centrality measures. Edge lists data used to generate
the networks are openly available for readers in an open data repository to
explore and use. Conclusion: We believe that NA can be a useful tool in
medication use studies. We have provided information and hopefully inspiration
for other researchers to use NA in their own projects. While network analyses
are useful for exploring and discovering structures in medication use studies,
it also has limitations. It can be challenging to interpret and it is not
suitable for hypothesis testing.

defined for a single communication direction, Downlink or Uplink, which does
not capture the closed-loop dynamics. In this paper, we extend the concept of
AoI by defining a new metric, Age of Loop (AoL), relevant for WNCS closed-loop
systems. The AoL is defined as the time elapsed since the piece of information
causing the latest action or state (depending on the selected time origin) was
generated. We then use the proposed metric to learn the WNCS latency and

two typical strategies to reduce expensive manual annotations in machine

the available labeled source data, which may have different distributions from
unlabeled samples in the target domain, while SSL employs few manually
annotated target samples. Although UDA and SSL are seemingly very different
strategies, we find that they are closely related in terms of task objectives
and solutions, and SSL is a special case of UDA problems. Based on this
finding, we further investigate whether SSL methods work on UDA tasks. By
adapting eight representative SSL algorithms on UDA benchmarks, we show that
SSL methods are strong UDA learners. Especially, state-of-the-art SSL methods
significantly outperform existing UDA methods on the challenging UDA benchmark
of DomainNet, and state-of-the-art UDA methods could be further enhanced with
SSL techniques. We thus promote that SSL methods should be employed as

Contextual Adaptive Doubly Robust (CADR) estimator, the first estimator for
policy value that is asymptotically normal under contextual adaptive data

adaptive and consistent conditional standard deviation estimators for
stabilization. Extensive numerical experiments using 57 OpenML datasets

network of coupled units is essential to control and operate such systems.
Often a perturbation initiated in one unit spreads to other units whose
dynamical state they transiently alter. The maximum state changes at those
units and the timings of these changes constitute key characteristics of such
transient response dynamics. However, even for linear dynamical systems it is
not possible to analytically determine time and amplitude of the maximal
response of a unit to a perturbation. Here, we propose to extract approximate
peak times and amplitudes from effective expectation values used to
characterize the typical time and magnitude of the response of a unit by
interpreting the system's response as a probability distribution over time. We
derive analytic estimators for the peak response based on these expectation
value measures in linearized systems operating close to a stable fixed point.
These estimators can be expressed in terms of the inverse of the system's
Jacobian. We obtain identical results with different approximations for the
response dynamics, indicating that these estimators become exact in the limit
of weak coupling. Furthermore, the results suggest that perturbations spread
ballistically in networks with diffusive coupling.

We concentrate on two cases: (i) bulk-corner correspondence, (ii) edge-corner

existence of the mobility gaps and clarify the related topological invariant
that characterizes the mobility gap. Furthermore, we find that, while the
system preserves the bulk-corner correspondence in the presence of disorder,
the corner states are protected by the mobility gap instead of the bulk gap.
For the edge-corner correspondence case, we show that the bulk mobility gap and
edge band gaps of HOTIs are no longer closed simultaneously. Therefore, a rich
phase diagram is obtained, including various disorder-induced phase transition
processes. Notably, a disorder-induced transition from the non-trivial to
trivial phase is realized, distinguishing the HOTIs from the other topological
states. Our results deepen the understanding of bulk-boundary correspondence

generates an Assembly Task Sequence Graph (ATSG) by recognizing a graphical
instruction manual. An ATSG is a graph describing the assembly task procedure
by detecting types of parts included in the instruction images, completing the
missing information automatically, and correcting the detection errors
automatically. To build an ATSG, the proposed method first extracts the
information of the parts contained in each image of the graphical instruction
manual. Then, by using the extracted part information, it estimates the proper
work motions and tools for the assembly task. After that, the method builds an
ATSG by considering the relationship between the previous and following images,
which makes it possible to estimate the undetected parts caused by occlusion
using the information of the entire image series. Finally, by collating the
total number of each part with the generated ATSG, the excess or deficiency of
parts are investigated, and task procedures are removed or added according to
those parts. In the experiment section, we build an ATSG using the proposed
method to a graphical instruction manual for a chair and demonstrate the action
sequences found in the ATSG can be performed by a dual-arm robot execution. The
results show the proposed method is effective and simplifies robot teaching in

in constraining the expansion history of the Universe at late times and are
characterized by the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch
$r_\mathrm{s}(z_\mathrm{d})$. The latter quantity can be calculated either
numerically using recombination codes or via fitting functions, such as the one
by Eisenstein and Hu (EH), made via grids of parameters of the recombination
history. Here we quantify the accuracy of these expressions and show that they
can strongly bias the derived constraints on the cosmological parameters using
BAO data. Then, using a machine learning approach, called the genetic
algorithms, we proceed to derive new analytic expressions for
$r_\mathrm{s}(z_\mathrm{d})$ which are accurate at the $\sim0.003\%$ level in a
range of $10\sigma$ around the Planck 2018 best-fit or $\sim0.018\%$ in a much
broader range, compared to $\sim 2-4\%$ for the EH expression, thus obtaining
an improvement of two to three orders of magnitude. Moreover, we also provide
fits that include the effects of massive neutrinos and an extension to the
concordance cosmological model assuming variations of the fine structure
constant. Finally, we note that our expressions can be used to ease the
computational cost required to compute $r_\mathrm{s}(z_\mathrm{d})$ with a
Boltzmann code when deriving cosmological constraints using BAO data from

fundamental role in the nonperturbative physics in the strong interaction is
anticipated to add restrictive effects on the symmetry potentials and in-medium
NN cross sections. For comparison, we also perform the study with the usual
relativistic mean-field (RMF) model. The numerical results with the NJL and RMF
models are similar at saturation density and below, since a priori fit was made
to saturation properties. With the increase of nuclear density, the chiral
symmetry starts to be restored partially in the NJL model, resulting in the
explicit fall of the scalar density. In a large energy span, the symmetry
potential acquires a significant rise for the partial restoration of the chiral
symmetry, compared to the one with the RMF model. It is found that the
in-medium NN cross sections in the RIA with the NJL and RMF models both
increase with the density in the energy region interested in this study,
whereas those with the NJL model increase sharply as long as a clear chiral
symmetry restoration takes place. The different tendency of observables in
density can be transmitted to the different energy dependence in the RIA. The
NJL model is shown to have characteristic energy-dependent symmetry potentials
and NN cross sections beyond saturation point, apart from the RMF models.

Furthermore, when both B and N atoms are doped at the same site of the hexagon,

many sensor-signal analysis tasks to be performed (e.g. detection,
classification and tracking) using a filterbank of low-pass digital
differentiators. Such filters are readily designed via flatness constraints on
the derivatives of the complex frequency response at dc, pi and at the centre
frequencies of narrowband interferers, i.e. using maximally-flat (MaxFlat)
designs. Infinite-impulse-response (IIR) filters are ideal in embedded online
systems with high data-rates because computational complexity is independent of
their (fading) memory. A novel procedure for the design of MaxFlat IIR
filterbanks with improved passband phase linearity is presented in this paper,
as a possible alternative to Kalman and Wiener filters in a class of
derivative-state estimation problems with uncertain signal models. Butterworth
poles are used for configurable bandwidth and guaranteed stability. Flatness
constraints of arbitrary order are derived for temporal derivatives of
arbitrary order and a prescribed group delay. As longer lags (in samples) are
readily accommodated in oversampled systems, an expression for the optimal
group delay that minimizes the white-noise gain (i.e. the error variance of the
derivative estimate at steady state) is derived. Filter zeros are optimally
placed for the required passband phase response and the cancellation of
narrowband interferers in the stopband, by solving a linear system of
equations. Low complexity filterbank realizations are discussed then their
behaviour is analysed in a Teager-Kaiser operator to detect pulsed signals and
in a state observer to track manoeuvring targets in simulated scenarios.

distinct categories, such as Normal, COVID-19, myocardial infarction (MI),
abnormal heartbeat (AHB), and recovered myocardial infarction (RMI) were used
in this study. Six different deep CNN models (ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101,

different classification schemes: two-class classification (Normal vs

finally, five-class classification (Normal, COVID-19, MI, AHB, and RMI). For
two-class and three-class classification, Densenet201 outperforms other

dwarfs (WDs) at different cooling ages, indicating ongoing accretion of
asteroidal material, whilst only a few per cent of the WDs possess a dust disk,
and all these WDs are accreting metals. Here, assuming that a rubble-pile
asteroid is scattered inside a WD's Roche lobe by a planet, we study its tidal
disruption and the long-term evolution of the resulting fragments. We find that
after a few pericentric passages, the asteroid is shredded into its constituent
particles, forming a flat, thin ring. On a timescale of Myr, tens of per cent
of the particles are scattered onto the WD, and are therefore directly accreted
without first passing through a circularised close-in disk. Fragment mutual
collisions are most effective for coplanar fragments, and are thus only
important in $10^3-10^4$ yr before the orbital coplanarity is broken by the
planet. We show that for a rubble pile asteroid with a size frequency
distribution of the component particles following that of the near earth
objects, it has to be roughly at least 10 km in radius such that enough
fragments are generated and $\ge10\%$ of its mass is lost to mutual collisions.
At relative velocities of tens of km/s, such collisions grind down the tidal
fragments into smaller and smaller dust grains. The WD radiation forces may
shrink those grains' orbits, forming a dust disk. Tidal disruption of a
monolithic asteroid creates large km-size fragments, and only parent bodies
$\ge100$ km are able to generate enough fragments for mutual collisions to be
significant. Hence, those large asteroids experience a disk phase before being
accreted.

which regards small-loss data as correctly labeled during training. However,
losses are generated on-the-fly based on the model being trained with noisy
labels, and thus large-loss data are likely but not certainly to be incorrect.
There are actually two possibilities of a large-loss data point: (a) it is
mislabeled, and then its loss decreases slower than other data, since deep
neural networks ""learn patterns first""; (b) it belongs to an underrepresented
group of data and has not been selected yet. In this paper, we incorporate the
uncertainty of losses by adopting interval estimation instead of point
estimation of losses, where lower bounds of the confidence intervals of losses
derived from distribution-free concentration inequalities, but not losses
themselves, are used for sample selection. In this way, we also give large-loss
but less selected data a try; then, we can better distinguish between the cases
(a) and (b) by seeing if the losses effectively decrease with the uncertainty
after the try. As a result, we can better explore underrepresented data that
are correctly labeled but seem to be mislabeled at first glance. Experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to baselines and robust to a
broad range of label noise types.

metal cations additives have been tested to improve their optoelectronic
properties that it is already difficult to find an element that has not yet
been tried. In general, the variety of these approaches is united under the
name ""doping"", however, there is currently no clear understanding of the
mechanisms of the influence of the metal ion additives on the properties of the
lead halide perovskite materials. For many ions there is even no consensus on
the most fundamental questions: what lattice position does a given ion occupy
and is it incorporated in the structure at all? Here, we derived a system of
effective radii of different metal ions in the iodine environment for the set
of iodide compounds and reveal their crystal chemical role in the APbI3
perovskites. We analysed the possible lattice positions for 40 most common
monovalent, divalent, and trivalent metals to reveal whether they could
successfully enter into the perovskite structures. We show that, at most, three
parameters - effective size, electronegativity and the softness of metal ions
are the main ones for crystal chemical analysis of the possibility of metal
doping of hybrid halide perovskites. Our results provide a useful theoretical
guidance to rationalize and improve current doping strategies of hybrid halide
perovskites with metal ions.

nanometre scale particles in a viscous fluid requires novel methods to obtain
the hydrodynamic interactions, random displacements and Brownian drift at
minimal cost. Capturing Brownian drift is done most efficiently through a
judiciously constructed time-integration scheme that automatically accounts for
its contribution to particle motion. In this paper, we present a generalised
drift-correcting (gDC) scheme that accounts for Brownian drift for suspensions
of rigid particles with arbitrary shape. The scheme seamlessly integrates with
fast methods for computing the hydrodynamic interactions and random increments
and requires a single full mobility solve per time-step. As a result, the gDC
provides increased computational efficiency when used in conjunction with
grid-based methods that employ fluctuating hydrodynamics to obtain the random
increments. Further, for these methods the additional computations that the
scheme requires occur at the level of individual particles, and hence lend
themselves naturally to parallel computation. We perform a series of
simulations that demonstrate the gDC obtains similar levels of accuracy as
compared with the existing state-of-the-art. In addition, these simulations
illustrate the gDC's applicability to a wide array of relevant problems
involving Brownian suspensions of non-spherical particles, such as the
structure of liquid crystals and the rheology of complex fluids.

elastic nucleon-nucleon (NN) scattering amplitudes with the wave-packet
continuum discretisation method (WPCD). This method provides approximate
scattering solutions at multiple scattering energies simultaneously. We
therefore utilise a graphics processing unit (GPU) to explore the benefits of
this inherent parallelism. From a theoretical perspective, the WPCD method
promises a speedup compared to a standard matrix-inversion method. We use the
chiral NNLO$_{\rm opt}$ interaction to demonstrate that WPCD enables efficient
computation of NN scattering amplitudes provided one can tolerate an averaged
method error of $~1-5$ mb in the total cross section at scattering energies
$0-350$ MeV in the laboratory frame of reference. Considering only scattering
energies $\sim40-350$ MeV, we find a smaller method error of $\lesssim 1-2$ mb.
By increasing the number of wave-packets we can further reduce the overall
method error. However, the parallel leverage of the WPCD method will be offset
by the increased size of the resulting discretisation mesh. In practice, a
GPU-implementation is mainly advantageous for matrices that fit in the fast
on-chip shared memory. We find that WPCD is a promising method for
computationally efficient, statistical analyses of nuclear interactions from
effective field theory, where we can utilise Bayesian inference methods to
incorporate relevant uncertainties.

a different label space that does not contain the true class. Lots of
approaches, e.g., loss correction and label correction, cannot handle such
open-set noisy labels well, since they need training data and test data to
share the same label space, which does not hold for learning with open-set
noisy labels. The state-of-the-art methods thus employ the sample selection
approach to handle open-set noisy labels, which tries to select clean data from
noisy data for network parameters updates. The discarded data are seen to be
mislabeled and do not participate in training. Such an approach is intuitive
and reasonable at first glance. However, a natural question could be raised
""can such data only be discarded during training?"". In this paper, we show that
the answer is no. Specifically, we discuss that the instances of discarded data
could consist of some meaningful information for generalization. For this
reason, we do not abandon such data, but use instance correction to modify the
instances of the discarded data, which makes the predictions for the discarded
data consistent with given labels. Instance correction are performed by
targeted adversarial attacks. The corrected data are then exploited for
training to help generalization. In addition to the analytical results, a
series of empirical evidences are provided to justify our claims.

an accurate description of the spatio-temporal evolution of the emergency

statistical approaches to forecast ambulance dispatches, typically modelling
the data as a point pattern occurring on a planar region. Nevertheless,
ambulance interventions can be more appropriately modelled as a realisation of
a point process occurring on a linear network. The constrained spatial domain
raises specific challenges and unique methodological problems that cannot be
ignored when developing a proper statistical approach. Hence, this paper
proposes a spatio-temporal model to analyse ambulance dispatches focusing on
the interventions that occurred in the road network of Milan (Italy) from 2015
to 2017. We adopt a non-separable first-order intensity function with spatial
and temporal terms. The temporal dimension is estimated semi-parametrically
using a Poisson regression model, while the spatial dimension is estimated
non-parametrically using a network kernel function. A set of weights is
included in the spatial term to capture space-time interactions, inducing
non-separability in the intensity function. A series of tests show that our
approach successfully models the ambulance interventions and captures the
space-time patterns more accurately than planar or separable point process
models.

Haldane-Hubbard model is mapped into an effective interacting boson model,

find that an energy gap opens at the K and K' points. Moreover, we also find

attacker and vice versa. Insight into this game between these two agents
provides a means for the defender to identify and make optimal decisions. To
date, the adversarial risk analysis framework has provided a
decision-analytical approach to solve such game problems in the presence of
uncertainty and uses Monte Carlo simulation to calculate and identify optimal

Compared to Monte Carlo simulation the proposed hybrid Bayesian network
inference is more versatile because it provides an automated way to compute
hybrid Defend-Attack models and extends their use to involve mixtures of
continuous and discrete variables, of any kind. More importantly, the hybrid
Bayesian network approach is novel in that it supports dynamic decision making
whereby new real-time observations can update the Defend-Attack model in

extra variables and longer decision sequence. Examples are presented,
illustrating how the proposed framework can be adjusted for more complicated

anomalies may lead to incorrect, even dangerous behaviors of the autonomous
agent equipped with such segmentation model when deployed in the real world.
Current state of the art of anomaly segmentation uses generative models,
exploiting their incapability to reconstruct patterns unseen during training.
However, training these models is expensive, and their generated artifacts may
create false anomalies. In this paper we take a different route and we propose
to address anomaly segmentation through prototype learning. Our intuition is
that anomalous pixels are those that are dissimilar to all class prototypes
known by the model. We extract class prototypes from the training data in a
lightweight manner using a cosine similarity-based classifier. Experiments on
StreetHazards show that our approach achieves the new state of the art, with a
significant margin over previous works, despite the reduced computational
overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/DarioFontanel/PAnS.

used for diverse prediction tasks. Previous work in adding strong privacy
protection to GPs via differential privacy (DP) has been limited to protecting
only the privacy of the prediction targets (model outputs) but not inputs. We
break this limitation by introducing GPs with DP protection for both model
inputs and outputs. We achieve this by using sparse GP methodology and
publishing a private variational approximation on known inducing points. The
approximation covariance is adjusted to approximately account for the added
uncertainty from DP noise. The approximation can be used to compute arbitrary
predictions using standard sparse GP techniques. We propose a method for
hyperparameter learning using a private selection protocol applied to
validation set log-likelihood. Our experiments demonstrate that given
sufficient amount of data, the method can produce accurate models under strong
privacy protection.

the magnetic modes. This causes magnetic field screening that does not follow
the standard exponential law and hence cannot be characterized by a single
length scale: the London penetration length.
  We also demonstrate that the resulting linear mixed modes, correctly predict
spontaneous fields and their orientation. We show that these mixed modes cause
external fields to decay non-monotonically in the bulk. This is observed as the
magnetic field twisting direction, up to an angle of $\pi/2$, as it decays in
the nonlinear model.
  Finally, we demonstrate that there are two non-degenerate domain wall

clockwise or anti-clockwise interpolation of the inter-component phase
difference, each producing a different solution for the other fields. However,
only domain wall solutions in $s+id$ systems exhibit magnetic field twisting.

a number of K2 targets in Hyades that have also been observed in Campaigns 4

Taking this temporal variation into account, we constrain projected sizes and
temperature contrast properties of the starspots in the stellar photosphere to
be approximately 10% and 0.95, respectively. These starspot properties can
induce relatively large differences in the variability amplitude over different
observational passbands, and we find that radial-velocity jitter may be more
suppressed in the NIR than previously expected. Our result supports profits of

followed by a deep task-specific transformer that takes as input those K
tokens. Additionally, we modify the task-specific attention to incorporate the
pruning scores. The two transformers are jointly trained by optimizing the
task-specific loss. We run experiments on three benchmarks, including
entailment and question-answering. We show that for a small drop of accuracy,
DoT improves training and inference time by at least 50%. We also show that the

during the peak-traffic times. In such a scheme, each file in the data center
or library is usually divided into a number of packets to pursue a low
broadcasting rate based on the designed placements at each user's cache.
However, the implementation complexity of this scheme increases as the number
of packets increases. It is crucial to design a scheme with a small
subpacketization level, while maintaining a relatively low transmission rate.
It is known that the design of caches in users (i.e., the placement phase) and
broadcasting (i.e., the delivery phase) can be unified in one matrix, namely
the placement delivery array (PDA). This paper proposes a novel PDA
construction by selecting proper orthogonal arrays (POAs), which generalizes
some known constructions but with a more flexible memory size. Based on the
proposed PDA construction, an effective transformation is further proposed to
enable a coded caching scheme to have a smaller subpacketization level.
Moreover, two new coded caching schemes with the coded placement are
considered. It is shown that the proposed schemes yield a lower
subpacketization level and transmission rate over some existing schemes.

Neutrino masses are induced at the one-loop level thanks to the states
belonging to the dark sector. However, in contrast to the standard Scotogenic
model, only the scalar dark matter candidate is viable in this version. After
presenting the model and explaining some particularities about neutrino mass
generation, we concentrate on its dark matter phenomenology. We show that the
observed dark matter relic density can be correctly reproduced in the usual
parameter space regions found for the standard Scotogenic model or the Inert
Doublet model. In addition, the presence of the charged fermions may open up
new regions, provided some tuning of the parameters is allowed.

constrained optimization to constrained dynamics by formalizing economic

framework of General Constrained Dynamics (GCD), households, firms, banks, and
the government employ forces to change economic variables according to their
desire and their power to assert their interest. These ex-ante forces are
completed by constraint forces from unanticipated system constraints to yield
the ex-post dynamics. The flexible out-of-equilibrium model can combine
Keynesian concepts such as the balance sheet approach and slow adaptation of
prices and quantities with bounded rationality (gradient climbing) and
interacting agents discussed in behavioral economics and agent-based models.
The framework integrates some elements of different schools of thought and
overcomes some restrictions inherent to optimization approaches, such as the

respectively second and first order for the entire concentration range.
However, above a concentration threshold of $\eta=80\%$, electrostatic
repulsion hinders the formation of solid and liquid globules, and the interplay
between enthalpic and entropic interactions leads to the formation of liquid
pearl-necklace ad solid helical structures. The probability distribution,
$P(E,T)$, indicates that at high $\eta$, the pearl-necklace liquid phase
freezes into a stable solid helix-like structure with a free energy barrier
higher than the freezing globule transition at low $\eta$.

directly applied for infrared small targets since pooling layers in their

Specifically, we design a dense nested interactive module (DNIM) to achieve
progressive interaction among high-level and low-level features. With the
repeated interaction in DNIM, infrared small targets in deep layers can be
maintained. Based on DNIM, we further propose a cascaded channel and spatial

fully exploited by repeated fusion and enhancement. Moreover, we develop an

is considered a universal and agnostic biosignature. Homochirality induces
fractional circular polarization in the incident light that it reflects.
Because this circularly polarized light can be sensed remotely, it can be one
of the most compelling candidate biosignatures in life detection missions.
While there are also other sources of circular polarization, these result in
spectrally flat signals with lower magnitude. Additionally, circular
polarization can be a valuable tool in Earth remote sensing because the
circular polarization signal directly relates to vegetation physiology. Aims.
While high-quality circular polarization measurements can be obtained in the
laboratory and under semi-static conditions in the field, there has been a
significant gap to more realistic remote sensing conditions. Methods. In this
study, we present sensitive circular spectropolarimetric measurements of
various landscape elements taken from a fast-moving helicopter. Results. We
demonstrate that during flight, within mere seconds of measurements, we can
differentiate (S/N>5) between grass fields, forests, and abiotic urban areas.
Importantly, we show that with only nonzero circular polarization as a
discriminant, photosynthetic organisms can even be measured in lakes.
Conclusions. Circular spectropolarimetry can be a powerful technique to detect
life beyond Earth, and we emphasize the potential of utilizing circular
spectropolarimetry as a remote sensing tool to characterize and monitor in
detail the vegetation physiology and terrain features of Earth itself.

it is by predicting the intermediate frame based on the reference frames to
upsample data to high frame rate ones. However, due to high-dimensional and
sparse characteristics of point clouds, it is more difficult to predict the
intermediate frame for LiDAR point clouds than videos. In this paper, we
propose a novel LiDAR point cloud frame interpolation method, which exploits
range images (RIs) as an intermediate representation with CNNs to conduct the
frame interpolation process. Considering the inherited characteristics of RIs
differ from that of color images, we introduce spatially adaptive convolutions
to extract range features adaptively, while a high-efficient flow estimation
method is presented to generate optical flows. The proposed model then warps
the input frames and range features, based on the optical flows to synthesize
the interpolated frame. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset have clearly
demonstrated that our method consistently achieves superior frame interpolation
results with better perceptual quality to that of using state-of-the-art video

using a finite volume framework. A hydrostatic reconstruction strategy, an
upwinding of the sources at the interfaces, and a careful choice of the central

muon-anti muon annihilation. Performing a realistic detector simulation and
deploying a multivariate technique, we constrain the LFV couplings $c_{\tau e}$
and $c_{\tau \mu}$ for both the cases of unpolarized and polarized muon beams.
Three different chiral structures are considered for the LFV ALP coupling and
the muon collider is assumed to operate at the center-of-mass energies of 126,
350 and 1500 GeV. We present a procedure to search for LFV ALPs at colliders
which takes advantage of tau polarization-induced effects. Polarized tau
leptons which produce such effects can be produced when the initial muon beams
are polarized. Utilizing the properties of polarized tau decays, the main SM
background which overwhelms the ALP production in the case of unpolarized muon
beams can be significantly suppressed. We present 95$\%$ CL expected limits on
the LFV couplings and show that the present analysis can improve current
experimental limits on the ALP LFV couplings by roughly one order of magnitude.

method in the framework of multi-label remote sensing (RS) image retrieval
problems. The proposed method aims to extract and exploit multi-label
co-occurrence relationships associated to each RS image in the archive. To this
end, each training image is initially represented with a graph structure that
provides region-based image representation combining both local information and
the related spatial organization. Unlike the other graph-based methods, the
proposed method contains a novel learning strategy to train a deep neural
network for automatically predicting a graph structure of each RS image in the

to characterize the image content based on its multi-label co-occurrence

and is crucial for developing promising dialogue systems. However, existing
metrics have two major limitations: (a) they are mostly trained in a simplified
two-level setting (coherent vs. incoherent), while humans give Likert-type
multi-level coherence scores, dubbed as ""quantifiable""; (b) their predicted
coherence scores cannot align with the actual human rating standards due to the
absence of human guidance during training. To address these limitations, we
propose Quantifiable Dialogue Coherence Evaluation (QuantiDCE), a novel
framework aiming to train a quantifiable dialogue coherence metric that can
reflect the actual human rating standards. Specifically, QuantiDCE includes two
training stages, Multi-Level Ranking (MLR) pre-training and Knowledge
Distillation (KD) fine-tuning. During MLR pre-training, a new MLR loss is
proposed for enabling the model to learn the coarse judgement of coherence
degrees. Then, during KD fine-tuning, the pretrained model is further finetuned
to learn the actual human rating standards with only very few human-annotated
data. To advocate the generalizability even with limited fine-tuning data, a
novel KD regularization is introduced to retain the knowledge learned at the
pre-training stage. Experimental results show that the model trained by
QuantiDCE presents stronger correlations with human judgements than the other
state-of-the-art metrics.

that the average degree among these vertices is maximized. Densest subgraph has
numerous applications in learning, e.g., community detection in social
networks, link spam detection, correlation mining, bioinformatics, and so on.
Although there are efficient algorithms that output either exact or approximate
solutions to the densest subgraph problem, existing algorithms may violate the
privacy of the individuals in the network, e.g., leaking the
existence/non-existence of edges.
  In this paper, we study the densest subgraph problem in the framework of the
differential privacy, and we derive the first upper and lower bounds for this
problem. We show that there exists a linear-time $\epsilon$-differentially
private algorithm that finds a $2$-approximation of the densest subgraph with
an extra poly-logarithmic additive error. Our algorithm not only reports the
approximate density of the densest subgraph, but also reports the vertices that
form the dense subgraph.
  Our upper bound almost matches the famous $2$-approximation by Charikar both
in performance and in approximation ratio, but we additionally achieve
differential privacy. In comparison with Charikar's algorithm, our algorithm
has an extra poly-logarithmic additive error. We partly justify the additive
error with a new lower bound, showing that for any differentially private
algorithm that provides a constant-factor approximation, a sub-logarithmic
additive error is inherent.
  We also practically study our differentially private algorithm on real-world
graphs, and we show that in practice the algorithm finds a solution which is
very close to the optimal

study these concepts for cubic graphs in an attempt to characterise those cubic
graphs for which every perfect matching corresponds to one of the colours of a
proper 3-edge-colouring of the graph. We discuss that this is equivalent to
saying that such graphs are even-2-factorable (E2F), that is, all 2-factors of
the graph contain only even cycles. The case for bipartite cubic graphs is
trivial, since if $G$ is bipartite then it is E2F. Thus, we restrict our
attention to non-bipartite cubic graphs. A sufficient, but not necessary,
condition for a cubic graph to be E2F is that it has the PMH-property. The aim
of this work is to introduce an infinite family of E2F non-bipartite cubic
graphs on two parameters, which we coin papillon graphs, and determine the
values of the respective parameters for which these graphs have the
PMH-property or are just E2F. We also show that no two papillon graphs with

maps are extended symmetrically from the centre of globus pallidus in the
coronal plane to simulate QSM acquisitions of difference spatial
coverages.Results: The proposed xQSM network led to the lowest DGM contrast
lost with the smallest susceptibility variation range across all spatial
coverages. For the digital brain phantom simulation, xQSM improved the DGM
susceptibility underestimation more than 20% in small spatial coverages. For
the in vivo acquisition, less than 5% DGM susceptibility error was achieved in
48 mm axial slabs using the xQSM network, while a minimum of 112 mm coverage
was required for conventional methods. It is also shown that the background
field removal process performed worse in reduced brain coverages, which further
deteriorated the subsequent dipole inversion. Conclusion: The recently proposed
deep learning-based xQSM method significantly improves the accuracy of DGM QSM
from small spatial coverages as compared with conventional QSM algorithms,
which can shorten DGM QSM acquisition time substantially.

recovering the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) feature in galaxy surveys that
has been degraded due to nonlinearities. Recent studies advocated adopting
iterative steps to improve the recovery much beyond that of the standard
technique. In this paper, we investigate the performance of a few selected
iterative reconstruction techniques focusing on the BAO and the broadband-shape
of the two-point clustering. We include redshift-space distortions, halo bias,
and shot noise and inspect the components of the reconstructed field in Fourier
space and in configuration space using both density field-based reconstruction
and displacement field-based reconstruction. We find that the displacement
field reconstruction becomes quickly challenging in the presence of
non-negligible shot noise and therefore present surrogate methods that can be
practically applied to a much more sparse field such as galaxies. For a galaxy
field, implementing a debiasing step to remove the Lagrangian bias appears
crucial for the displacement field reconstruction. We show that the iterative
reconstruction does not substantially improve the BAO feature beyond an
aggressively optimized standard reconstruction with a small smoothing kernel.
However, we find taking iterative steps allows us to use a small smoothing
kernel more `stably', i.e., without causing a substantial deviation from the
linear power spectrum on large scales. In one specific example we studied, we
find that a deviation of 13\% in $P( k \sim 0.1h/Mpc)$ with an aggressive
standard reconstruction can reduce to 3-4\% with iterative steps.

in visual pre-training task. By simply pulling the different augmented views of

knowledge and significantly improve the transfer performance of pre-training

problem, i.e., they only focus on limited regions or the extracted features on
totally different regions inside each image are nearly the same. Generally,
this problem makes the pre-training models cannot sufficiently describe the
multi-grained information inside images, which further limits the upper bound
of their transfer performance. To alleviate this issue, this paper introduces a
simple but effective mechanism, called Exploring the Diversity and Invariance
in Yourself E-DIY. By simply pushing the most different regions inside each
augmented view away, E-DIY can preserve the diversity of extracted region-level
features. By pulling the most similar regions from different augmented views of

applications, such as forecasting weather from only a few measurements of
meteorological or remote sensing data. Existing methods for spatial
interpolation, such as variants of kriging and spatial autoregressive models,
tend to suffer from at least one of the following limitations: (a) the
assumption of stationarity, (b) the assumption of isotropy, and (c) the
trade-off between modelling local or global spatial interaction. Addressing
these issues in this work, we propose the use of Markov reward processes (MRPs)
as a spatial interpolation method, and we introduce three variants thereof: (i)
a basic static discount MRP (SD-MRP), (ii) an accurate but mostly theoretical
optimised MRP (O-MRP), and (iii) a transferable weight prediction MRP (WP-MRP).
All variants of MRP interpolation operate locally, while also implicitly
accounting for global spatial relationships in the entire system through
recursion. Additionally, O-MRP and WP-MRP no longer assume stationarity and are
robust to anisotropy. We evaluated our proposed methods by comparing the mean
absolute errors of their interpolated grid cells to those of 7 common
baselines, selected from models based on spatial autocorrelation, (spatial)
regression, and deep learning.
  We performed detailed evaluations on two publicly available datasets (local
GDP values, and COVID-19 patient trajectory data). The results from these

achieved significantly lower errors than the existing methods in 23 out of 40

is network traffic analysis, which relies on network data to detect the

network speeds and amount of traffic, network analysis is generally limited to
work on aggregated network data, which is traditionally challenging and yields
mixed results. In this paper we present MalPhase, a system that was designed to
cope with the limitations of aggregated flows. MalPhase features a multi-phase
pipeline for malware detection, type and family classification. The use of an
extended set of network flow features and a simultaneous multi-tier
architecture facilitates a performance improvement for deep learning models,
making them able to detect malicious flows (>98% F1) and categorize them to a
respective malware type (>93% F1) and family (>91% F1). Furthermore, the use of
robust features and denoising autoencoders allows MalPhase to perform well on

detects unseen malware samples with performance comparable to that of known

population of unmerged dark matter subhalos. These subhalos could shine in
gamma-rays and be eventually detected in gamma-ray surveys as unidentified
sources. We performed a thorough selection among unidentified Fermi-LAT Objects
(UFOs) to identify them as possible TeV-scale dark matter subhalo candidates.
We search for very-high-energy (E $\gtrsim$ 100 GeV) gamma-ray emissions using
H.E.S.S. observations towards four selected UFOs. Since no significant
very-high-energy gamma-ray emission is detected in any dataset of the four
observed UFOs nor in the combined UFO dataset, strong constraints are derived
on the product of the velocity-weighted annihilation cross section $\langle
\sigma v \rangle$ by the $J$-factor for the dark matter models. The 95% C.L.
observed upper limits derived from combined H.E.S.S. observations reach
$\langle \sigma v \rangle J$ values of 3.7$\times$10$^{-5}$ and
8.1$\times$10$^{-6}$ GeV$^2$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ in the $W^+W^-$ and
$\tau^+\tau^-$ channels, respectively, for a 1 TeV dark matter mass. Focusing
on thermal WIMPs, the H.E.S.S. constraints restrict the $J$-factors to lie in
the range 6.1$\times$10$^{19}$ - 2.0$\times$10$^{21}$ GeV$^2$cm$^{-5}$, and the
masses to lie between 0.2 and 6 TeV in the $W^+W^-$ channel. For the
$\tau^+\tau^-$ channel, the $J$-factors lie in the range 7.0$\times$10$^{19}$ -
7.1$\times$10$^{20}$ GeV$^2$cm$^{-5}$ and the masses lie between 0.2 and 0.5
TeV. Assuming model-dependent predictions from cosmological N-body simulations
on the $J$-factor distribution for Milky Way-sized galaxies, the dark matter
models with masses greater than 0.3 TeV for the UFO emissions can be ruled out
at high confidence level.

  optimization and implicit models","Accepted as a spotlight to ICLR 2022",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In recent years, implicit deep learning has emerged as a method to increase
the effective depth of deep neural networks. While their training is
memory-efficient, they are still significantly slower to train than their
explicit counterparts. In Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs), the training is
performed as a bi-level problem, and its computational complexity is partially
driven by the iterative inversion of a huge Jacobian matrix. In this paper, we
propose a novel strategy to tackle this computational bottleneck from which
many bi-level problems suffer. The main idea is to use the quasi-Newton
matrices from the forward pass to efficiently approximate the inverse Jacobian
matrix in the direction needed for the gradient computation. We provide a
theorem that motivates using our method with the original forward algorithms.
In addition, by modifying these forward algorithms, we further provide
theoretical guarantees that our method asymptotically estimates the true
implicit gradient. We empirically study this approach and the recent
Jacobian-Free method in different settings, ranging from hyperparameter
optimization to large Multiscale DEQs (MDEQs) applied to CIFAR and ImageNet.
Both methods reduce significantly the computational cost of the backward pass.
While SHINE has a clear advantage on hyperparameter optimization problems, both
methods attain similar computational performances for larger scale problems
such as MDEQs at the cost of a limited performance drop compared to the
original models.

is one of the core problems in modern medical imaging, and by now there exist a
plethora of methods for recovering a signal from such samples. Examples of
methods, which can utilise wavelet reconstruction, include generalised
sampling, infinite-dimensional compressive sensing, the
parameterised-background data-weak (PBDW) method etc. However, for any of these
methods to be applied in practice, accurate and fast modelling of an $N \times
M$ section of the infinite-dimensional change-of-basis matrix between the
sampling basis (Fourier or Walsh-Hadamard samples) and the wavelet
reconstruction basis is paramount. In this work, we derive an algorithm, which
bypasses the $NM$ storage requirement and the $\mathcal{O}(NM)$ computational
cost of matrix-vector multiplication with this matrix when using Walsh-Hadamard
samples and wavelet reconstruction. The proposed algorithm computes the
matrix-vector multiplication in $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ operations and has a
storage requirement of $\mathcal{O}(2^q)$, where $N=2^{dq} M$, (usually $q \in
\{1,2\}$) and $d=1,2$ is the dimension. As matrix-vector multiplications is the
computational bottleneck for iterative algorithms used by the mentioned
reconstruction methods, the proposed algorithm speeds up the reconstruction of
wavelet coefficients from Walsh-Hadamard samples considerably.

mode collapse, namely the generator can only map latent variables to a partial

regularize this issue with an independent and identically distributed (IID)
sampling perspective and emphasize that holding the IID property for generation
for target distribution (i.e. real distribution) can naturally avoid mode
collapse. This is based on the basic IID assumption for real data in machine

generations $\{G(\mathbf{z})\}$ may not necessarily be IID from the target
distribution. Based on this observation, we propose a necessary condition of
IID generation and provide a new loss to encourage the closeness between the
inverse source of real data and the Gaussian source in the latent space to
regularize the generation to be IID from the target distribution. The logic is
that the inverse samples from target data should also be IID in the source
distribution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show the
effectiveness of our model.

communication and differential privacy (DP) of the local datasets at the remote

model. More precisely, we consider the FL setting in which clients are prompted
to train a machine learning model by simultaneous channel-aware and limited
communications with a parameter server (PS) over a Gaussian multiple-access
channel (GMAC), so that transmissions sum coherently at the PS globally aware
of the channel coefficients. For this setting, an algorithm is proposed based
on applying federated stochastic gradient descent (FedSGD) for training the
minimum of a given loss function based on the local gradients,
Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) random projection for reducing the dimension of the
local updates, and artificial noise to further aid user's privacy. For this
scheme, our results show that the local DP performance is mainly improved due
to injecting noise of greater variance on each dimension while keeping the
sensitivity of the projected vectors unchanged. This is while the convergence
rate is slowed down compared to the case without dimensionality reduction. As
the performance outweighs for the slower convergence, the trade-off between
privacy and convergence is higher but is shown to lessen in high-dimensional
regime yielding almost the same trade-off with much less communication cost.

introducing episodic training and class-wise prototypes. However, the FSS
problem remains challenging due to three limitations: (1) Models are distracted
by task-unrelated information; (2) The representation ability of a single
prototype is limited; (3) Class-related prototypes ignore the prior knowledge
of base classes. We propose the Prior-Enhanced network with Meta-Prototypes to
tackle these limitations. The prior-enhanced network leverages the support and
query (pseudo-) labels in feature extraction, which guides the model to focus
on the task-related features of the foreground objects, and suppress much noise
due to the lack of supervised knowledge. Moreover, we introduce multiple
meta-prototypes to encode hierarchical features and learn class-agnostic
structural information. The hierarchical features help the model highlight the
decision boundary and focus on hard pixels, and the structural information
learned from base classes is treated as the prior knowledge for novel classes.

asymptotic behavior of the mass inside the ball, and obtain a large-deviation

obstacles, where a random `trap field' in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is created via a
Poisson point process. The trap field consists of balls of fixed radius
centered at the atoms of the Poisson point process. The mild obstacle rule is
that when a particle is inside a trap, it branches at a lower rate, which is
allowed to be zero, whereas when outside the trap field it branches at the
normal rate. As an application of our LD result on the mass of BBM inside
expanding balls, we prove upper bounds on the LD probabilities for the mass of
BBM among mild obstacles, which we then use along with the Borel-Cantelli lemma
to prove the corresponding strong law of large numbers. Our results are

energy on studies that explored such a process due to the vigorous core
convection of massive stars just before they experience a core collapse
supernova explosion. Using the stellar evolutionary code MESA we find that the
wave energy causes an expansion within few years by tens to hundreds solar
radii. Despite the large brightening, we expect the increase in radius and
luminosity to substantially enhance mass loss rate and dust formation. The dust
shifts the star to become much redder (to the infrared), and the star might
actually become fainter in the visible. The overall appearance is of a faint
red transient event that lasts for months to few years. We suggest that in some
cases envelope expansion might lead stars that are about to leave the RGB to
engulf exoplanets. The extended envelope has a smaller binding energy to a
degree that allows planets of several Jupiter masses or more and brown dwarfs
to survive the common envelope evolution. We suggest this scenario to account

some important physical systems. Knowing the criteria and phase space geometry
that govern escape events plays an important role in making use of such
phenomenon, particularly when realistic frictional or dissipative forces are
present. We aim to extend the study the escape dynamics around the saddle from
two degrees of freedom to three degrees of freedom, presenting both a
methodology and phase space structures. Both the ideal conservative system and
a perturbed, dissipative system are considered. We define the five-dimensional
transition region, $\mathcal{T}_h$, as the set of initial conditions of a given
initial energy $h$ for which the trajectories will escape from one side of the
saddle to another. Invariant manifold arguments demonstrate that in the
six-dimensional phase space, the boundary of the transition region, $\partial
\mathcal{T}_h$, is topologically a four-dimensional hyper-cylinder in the
conservative system, and a four-dimensional hyper-sphere in the dissipative
system. The transition region $\mathcal{T}_h$ can be constructed by a solid
three-dimensional ellipsoid (solid three-dimensional cylinder) in the
three-dimensional configuration space, where at each point, there is a cone of
velocity -- the velocity directions leading to transition are given by cones,
with velocity magnitude given by the initial energy and the direction by two
spherical angles with given limits. To illustrate our analysis, we consider an
example system which has two potential minima connected by an index 1 saddle.

subsystems. Simulation-based approaches are typically used to support design
and Verification and Validation (V&V) of CPSs in several domains such as:
aerospace, defence, automotive, smart grid and healthcare. Accordingly, many
simulation-based tools are available, and this poses huge interoperability
challenges. To overcome them, in 2010 the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)
was proposed as an open standard to support both Model Exchange (ME) and
Co-Simulation (CS). Models adhering to such a standard are called Functional
Mock-up Units (FMUs). FMUs play an essential role in defining complex CPSs
through, e.g., the SSP standard. Simulation-based V&V of CPSs typically
requires exploring different scenarios (i.e., exogenous CPS input sequences),
many of them showing a shared prefix. Accordingly, the simulator state at the
end of a shared prefix is saved and then restored and used as a start state for
the simulation of the next scenario. In this context, an important FMI feature
is the capability to save and restore the internal FMU state on demand.
Unfortunately, the implementation of this feature is not mandatory and it is
available only within some commercial software. This motivates developing such
a feature for open-source CPS simulation environments. In this paper, we focus
on JModelica, an open-source modelling and simulation environment for CPSs
defined in the Modelica language. We describe how we have endowed JModelica
with our open-source implementation of the FMI 2.0 functions to save and
restore internal states of FMUs for ME. Furthermore, we present results
evaluating, through 934 benchmark models, correctness and efficiency of our
extended JModelica. Our results show that simulation-based V&V is, on average,
22 times faster with our get/set functionality than without it.

matter, radiation, and vacuum. Physics currently has a mixture of classical,
relativistic, and quantum concepts of mass, which generates a great deal of
confusion and many problems. Clear definitions need to be established if one
wants to avoid ghost hunting. In particular, by abandoning the idea of mass and
focusing on time and energy, some interesting implications are emerging. It is
noted that the cutoff frequency of the quantum vacuum energy, consistent with
the observations of the cosmological constant, corresponds to that of the
Cosmic Microwave Background. This might be consistent with the hypothesis of a
rotating and expanding universe described by a Kerr-de Sitter metric with the
observed cosmological constant. To verify this hypothesis is crucial to prove
the rotation of the universe.

systems yet are far from fully understood. Here, we explain an asymmetry
emerging upon repeating identical isotropic (uniformly random) operations.
Specifically, in two dimensions, repeating an isotropic rotation twice maps a
given point on the two-dimensional unit sphere (the unit circle) uniformly at
random to any point on the unit sphere, reflecting a statistical symmetry as
expected. In contrast, in three and higher dimensions, a point is mapped more
often closer to the original point than a uniform distribution predicts.
Curiously, in the limit of the dimension $d \rightarrow \infty$, a symmetric
distribution is approached again. We intuitively explain the emergence of this
asymmetry and why it disappears in higher dimensions by disentangling isotropic
rotations into a sequence of partial actions. The asymmetry emerges in two
qualitatively different forms and for a wide range of general random operations
relevant in complex systems modeling, including repeated continuous and
discrete rotations, roto-reflections and general orthogonal transformations

selection. Methods. One hundred and three patients who underwent rest gated
SPECT MPI were enrolled in this study. CRT response was defined as a decrease
in left ventricular end-systolic volume (LVESV) >= 15% at 6 +- 1 month follow
up. Autoencoder (AE), an unsupervised deep learning method, was trained by the
raw LV systolic phase polar maps to extract new LVMD parameters, called

relationships between new parameters with conventional LVMD parameters.
Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to establish a multivariate

the use of Bayesian inference makes it possible to take into account prior
information of both spectral distributions and image noise as probability
distributions. As a result, the proposed method can estimate spectral
distributions in a unified way, and it can enhance the robustness of the
estimation against noise, which conventional spectral-distribution estimation

located data has deepened interest in using them for various policy
interventions, through computational data analysis tasks such as spatial hot
spot detection. In this paper, we consider, for the first time to our best
knowledge, fairness in detecting spatial hot spots. We motivate the need for
ensuring fairness through statistical parity over the collective population
covered across chosen hot spots. We then characterize the task of identifying a
diverse set of solutions in the noteworthiness-fairness trade-off spectrum, to
empower the user to choose a trade-off justified by the policy domain. Being a
novel task formulation, we also develop a suite of evaluation metrics for fair
hot spots, motivated by the need to evaluate pertinent aspects of the task. We
illustrate the computational infeasibility of identifying fair hot spots using
naive and/or direct approaches and devise a method, codenamed {\it FiSH}, for
efficiently identifying high-quality, fair and diverse sets of spatial hot
spots. FiSH traverses the tree-structured search space using heuristics that
guide it towards identifying effective and fair sets of spatial hot spots.
Through an extensive empirical analysis over a real-world dataset from the
domain of human development, we illustrate that FiSH generates high-quality
solutions at fast response times.

open-source, web-based application for performing HVSR calculations in a
convenient, reliable, and statistically-consistent manner. HVSRweb allows the
user to upload three-component ambient noise records and perform the HVSR
calculation in the cloud, with no installation required. The HVSR calculation
can be performed using a single combined horizontal component (e.g.,
geometric-mean, squared-average) or multiple rotated horizontal components to
investigate azimuthal variability. HVSRweb can reject spurious time windows
using an automated frequency-domain window-rejection algorithm, removing the
need for subjective and time-consuming user interaction. It also facilitates
the use of lognormal statistics for $f_0$, allowing for a consistent
statistical framework capable of quantifying measurement uncertainty in terms
of either frequency or its reciprocal, period. In addition, HVSRweb presents
the opportunity to rapidly incorporate new developments in processing and
quantification of uncertainty as they emerge, and encourages standardization of
HVSR processing across users while avoiding the challenges associated with
traditional approaches that require the user to perform regular updates to keep

welcome development in the fight against traffic induced airborne pollutants.
As vehicle fleets become electrified, and tailpipe emissions become less
prevalent, non-tailpipe emissions (from tires and brake disks) will become the
dominant source of traffic related emissions, and will in all likelihood become
a major concern for human health. This trend is likely to be exacerbated by the
heavier weight of electric vehicles, their increased power, and their increased
torque capabilities, when compared with traditional vehicles. While the problem
of emissions from tire wear is well-known, issues around the process of tire
abrasion, its impact on the environment, and modelling and mitigation measures,
remain relatively unexplored. Work on this topic has proceeded in several
discrete directions including: on-vehicle collection methods; vehicle tire-wear
abatement algorithms and controlling the ride characteristics of a vehicle, all
with a view to abating tire emissions. Additional approaches include access
control mechanisms to manage aggregate tire emissions in a geofenced area with
other notable work focussing on understanding the particle size distribution of
tire generated PM, the degree to which particles become airborne, and the
health impacts of tire emissions. While such efforts are already underway, the
