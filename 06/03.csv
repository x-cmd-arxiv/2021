survey of one or more human raters. In survey settings, conventional

a classifier and K ratings per item, rescales any accuracy measure into one
that has an intuitive interpretation. The key insight is to score the
classifier not against the best proxy for the ground truth, such as a majority
vote of the raters, but against a single human rater at a time. That score can
be compared to other predictors' scores, in particular predictors created by
combining labels from several other human raters. The survey equivalence of any
classifier is the minimum number of raters needed to produce the same expected
score as that found for the classifier.

dialogue systems. It helps achieve diverse and high-quality responses by
selecting an answer from a small pool of generated candidates. The current
state-of-the-art ranking methods mainly use an encoding paradigm called
Cross-Encoder, which separately encodes each context-candidate pair and ranks
the candidates according to their fitness scores. However, Cross-Encoder
repeatedly encodes the same lengthy context for each candidate, resulting in
high computational costs. Poly-Encoder addresses the above problems by reducing
the interaction between context and candidates, but with a price of performance
drop. In this work, we develop a new paradigm called Uni-Encoder, that keeps
the full attention over each pair as in Cross-Encoder while only encoding the
context once, as in Poly-Encoder. Uni-Encoder encodes all the candidates with
the context in one forward pass. We use the same positional embedding for all
candidates to ensure they are treated equally and design a new attention
mechanism to avoid confusion. Our Uni-Encoder can simulate other ranking
paradigms using different attention and response concatenation methods.
Extensive experiments show that our proposed paradigm achieves new
state-of-the-art results on four benchmark datasets with high computational
efficiency. For instance, it improves R10@1 by 2.9% with an approximately 4X
faster inference speed on the Ubuntu V2 dataset.

predictions. Transformer's predictions are widely explained by the attention
weights, i.e., a probability distribution generated at its self-attention unit
(head). Current empirical studies provide shreds of evidence that attention
weights are not explanations by proving that they are not unique. A recent
study showed theoretical justifications to this observation by proving the
non-identifiability of attention weights. For a given input to a head and its
output, if the attention weights generated in it are unique, we call the
weights identifiable. In this work, we provide deeper theoretical analysis and
empirical observations on the identifiability of attention weights. Ignored in
the previous works, we find the attention weights are more identifiable than we
currently perceive by uncovering the hidden role of the key vector. However,
the weights are still prone to be non-unique attentions that make them unfit
for interpretation. To tackle this issue, we provide a variant of the encoder
layer that decouples the relationship between key and value vector and provides
identifiable weights up to the desired length of the input. We prove the
applicability of such variations by providing empirical justifications on
varied text classification tasks. The implementations are available at

Data resemblance detection is a novel technology to detect redundancy among
similarity. It extracts feature from each chunk content and treat chunks with
high similarity as candidates for removing redundancy. However, popular
resemblance methods such as ""N-transform"" and ""Finesse"" use only the chunk data
for feature extraction. A minor modification on the data chunk could seriously
deteriorate its capability for resemblance detection. In this paper, we
proposes a novel chunk-context aware resemblance detection algorithm, called
CARD, to mitigate this issue. CARD introduces a BP-Neural network-based
chunk-context aware model, and uses N-sub-chunk shingles-based initial feature
extraction strategy. It effectively integrates each data chunk content's
internal structure with the context information for feature extraction, the
impact of small changes in data chunks is significantly reduced. To evaluate
its performance, we implement a CARD prototype and conduct extensive
experiments using real-world data sets. The results show that CARD can detect
up to 75.03% more redundant data and accelerate the resemblance detection
operations by 5.6 to 17.8 times faster compared with the state-of-the-art

a general diagrammatic coaction was established using dimensional
regularisation, which may be realised in terms of a global coaction on

takes the first steps in generalising the diagrammatic coaction beyond one

for which all integrals expand into polylogarithms. In each case we determine
bases of master integrals and cuts in terms of hypergeometric functions, and
then use the global coaction to establish the diagrammatic coaction of all

exist, yet none scale to normal-form games with many actions and many players,
especially those with payoff tensors too big to be stored in memory. In this
work, we propose an approach that iteratively improves an approximation to a
Nash equilibrium through joint play. It accomplishes this by tracing a
previously established homotopy that defines a continuum of equilibria for the
game regularized with decaying levels of entropy. This continuum asymptotically
approaches the limiting logit equilibrium, proven by McKelvey and Palfrey
(1995) to be unique in almost all games, thereby partially circumventing the
well-known equilibrium selection problem of many-player games. To encourage
iterates to remain near this path, we efficiently minimize average deviation
incentive via stochastic gradient descent, intelligently sampling entries in
the payoff tensor as needed. Monte Carlo estimates of the stochastic gradient
from joint play are biased due to the appearance of a nonlinear max operator in
the objective, so we introduce additional innovations to the algorithm to
alleviate gradient bias. The descent process can also be viewed as repeatedly
constructing and reacting to a polymatrix approximation to the game. In these
ways, our proposed approach, average deviation incentive descent with adaptive
sampling (ADIDAS), is most similar to three classical approaches, namely
homotopy-type, Lyapunov, and iterative polymatrix solvers. The lack of local
convergence guarantees for biased gradient descent prevents guaranteed
convergence to Nash, however, we demonstrate through extensive experiments the
ability of this approach to approximate a unique Nash in normal-form games with
as many as seven players and twenty one actions (several billion outcomes) that
are orders of magnitude larger than those possible with prior algorithms.

nearing end calls for new avenues for improving the overall system performance.
One of these avenues is the exploration of alternative brain-inspired computing
architectures that aim at achieving the flexibility and computational
efficiency of biological neural processing systems. Within this context,
neuromorphic engineering represents a paradigm shift in computing based on the
implementation of spiking neural network architectures in which processing and
memory are tightly co-located. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive
overview of the field, highlighting the different levels of granularity at
which this paradigm shift is realized and comparing design approaches that
focus on replicating natural intelligence (bottom-up) versus those that aim at
solving practical artificial intelligence applications (top-down). First, we
present the analog, mixed-signal and digital circuit design styles, identifying
the boundary between processing and memory through time multiplexing, in-memory
computation, and novel devices. Then, we highlight the key tradeoffs for each
of the bottom-up and top-down design approaches, survey their silicon
implementations, and carry out detailed comparative analyses to extract design
guidelines. Finally, we identify necessary synergies and missing elements
required to achieve a competitive advantage for neuromorphic systems over
conventional machine-learning accelerators in edge computing applications, and
outline the key ingredients for a framework toward neuromorphic intelligence.

First, we show that the turbulent motion at
large scales obeys Gaussian statistics in the interval 0 < Rlambda < 8.8, where
Rlambda is the microscale Reynolds number, and that the Gaussian flow breaks
down to yield place to anomalous scaling at the universal Reynolds number
bounding the inequality above. In the inertial range of turbulence that emerges
following the breakdown, the effective Reynolds number based on the turbulent
viscosity, Rlambda* assumes this same constant value of about 9. This scenario
works also for the emergence of turbulence from an initially non-turbulent

structure functions and moments of spatial derivatives, by analyzing the
Navier-Stokes equations in the form developed by Hopf. We present a novel
procedure to close the Hopf equation, resulting in expressions for zetan in the
entire range of allowable moment-order, n, and demonstrate that accounting for
the temporal dynamics changes the scaling from normal to anomalous. For large
n, the theory predicts the saturation of zetan with n, leading to two
inferences: (a) the smallest length scale etan = LRe-1 << LRe-3/4, where Re is
the large-scale Reynolds number, and (b) velocity excursions across even the
smallest length scales can sometimes be as large as the large scale velocity
itself. Theoretical predictions for each of these aspects are shown to be in

these methods usually have difficulties in making accurate recommendations to
cold-start users, and tend to recommend similar news with those users have

attract users with different interests. Besides, they are usually diverse in
content and topic. Thus, in this paper we propose to incorporate news
popularity information to alleviate the cold-start and diversity problems for
personalized news recommendation. In our method, the ranking score for
recommending a candidate news to a target user is the combination of a
personalized matching score and a news popularity score. The former is used to
capture the personalized user interest in news. The latter is used to measure
time-aware popularity of candidate news, which is predicted based on news
content, recency, and real-time CTR using a unified framework. Besides, we
propose a popularity-aware user encoder to eliminate the popularity bias in

growth of computational and storage costs as calculations are extended to

factorization of nuclear interactions as a means to address this issue. We
perform Singular Value Decompositions of nucleon-nucleon interactions in
partial wave representation and study the dependence of the singular value
spectrum on interaction characteristics like regularization scheme and
resolution scales.
  We develop and implement the Similarity Renormalization Group (SRG) evolution
of the factorized interaction, and demonstrate that this SVD-SRG approach
accurately preserves two-nucleon observables.
  We find that low-resolution interactions allow the truncation of the SVD at
low rank, and that a small number of relevant components is sufficient to
capture the nuclear interaction and perform an accurate SRG evolution, while
the Coulomb interaction requires special consideration. The rank is uniform
across all partial waves, and almost independent of the basis choice in the
tested cases. This suggests an interpretation of the relevant singular
components as mere representations of a small set of abstract operators that
can describe the interaction and its SRG flow.
  Following the traditional workflow for nuclear interactions, we discuss how
the transformation between the center-of-mass and laboratory frames creates
redundant copies of the partial wave components when implemented in matrix
representation, and we discuss strategies for mitigation.
  Finally, we test the low-rank approximation to the SRG-evolved interactions
in many-body calculations using the In-Medium SRG. By including nuclear radii
in our analysis, we verify that the implementation of the SRG using the
singular vectors of the interaction does not spoil the evolution of other
observables.

assumptions on the DM phase-space distribution function (DF) in halos. This
applies to both particle (e.g. $p$-wave suppressed or Sommerfeld-enhanced
annihilation, scattering off atoms, etc.) and macroscopic DM candidates (e.g.
microlensing of primordial black holes). As experiments and observations
improve in precision, better assessing theoretical uncertainties becomes
pressing in the prospect of deriving reliable constraints on DM candidates or
trustworthy hints for detection. Most reliable predictions of DFs in halos are
based on solving the steady-state collisionless Boltzmann equation (e.g.
Eddington-like inversions, action-angle methods, etc.) consistently with
observational constraints. One can do so starting from maximal symmetries and a
minimal set of degrees of freedom, and then increasing complexity. Key issues
are then whether adding complexity, which is computationally costy, improves
predictions, and if so where to stop. Clues can be obtained by making
predictions for zoomed-in hydrodynamical cosmological simulations in which one
can access the true (coarse-grained) phase-space information. Here, we test an
axisymmetric extension of the Eddington inversion to predict the full DM DF
from its density profile and the total gravitational potential of the system.
This permits to go beyond spherical symmetry, and is a priori well suited for
spiral galaxies. We show that axisymmetry does not necessarily improve over
spherical symmetry because the (observationally unconstrained) angular momentum
of the DM halo is not generically aligned with the baryonic one. Theoretical
errors are similar to those of the Eddington inversion though, at the 10-20%
level for velocity-dependent predictions related to particle DM searches in
spiral galaxies. We extensively describe the approach and comment on the

explicitly compositional Tensor Product Representation (TPR), for the task of
abstractive summarization. The key feature of our model is a structural bias
that we introduce by encoding two separate representations for each token to
represent the syntactic structure (with role vectors) and semantic content
(with filler vectors) separately. The model then binds the role and filler
vectors into the TPR as the layer output. We argue that the structured
intermediate representations enable the model to take better control of the
contents (salient facts) and structures (the syntax that connects the facts)
when generating the summary. Empirically, we show that our TP-TRANSFORMER
outperforms the Transformer and the original TP-TRANSFORMER significantly on
several abstractive summarization datasets based on both automatic and human

individuals and communities in areas such as lending, education, employment,
and beyond. Such decisions often impact their subjects' future characteristics
and capabilities in an a priori unknown fashion. The decision-maker, therefore,
faces exploration-exploitation dilemmas akin to those in multi-armed bandits.
Following prior work, we model communities as arms. To capture the long-term
effects of ML-based allocation decisions, we study a setting in which the
reward from each arm evolves every time the decision-maker pulls that arm. We
focus on reward functions that are initially increasing in the number of pulls
but may become (and remain) decreasing after a certain point. We argue that an
acceptable sequential allocation of opportunities must take an arm's potential
for growth into account. We capture these considerations through the notion of
policy regret, a much stronger notion than the often-studied external regret,
and present an algorithm with provably sub-linear policy regret for
sufficiently long time horizons. We empirically compare our algorithm with
several baselines and find that it consistently outperforms them, in particular
for long time horizons.

simulations and (ii) analytical theory by \citet{dario_gareth}. The
instantaneous dynamics of the system is presented in terms of fluid velocity
fields, and the translational and angular velocities of the microswimmer,
whereas the long time dynamics is presented by plotting the squirmer
trajectories near curved boundaries in physical and dynamical space, as well as
characterising them in terms of (i) proximity parameter, (ii) retention time,
(iii) swimmer orientation and (iv) tangential velocity near the boundary, and
(v) scattering angle during the collision. Our detailed analysis shows that
irrespective of the type and strength, microswimmers exhibit a greater affinity
towards a concave boundary due to hydrodynamic interactions compared to a
convex boundary. In the presence of additional repulsive interactions with the
boundary, we find that pullers (propel by forward thrust) have a slightly
greater affinity towards the convex--curved walls compared to pushers (propel
by backward thrust). Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of the
consequence of hydrodynamic interactions in a unified framework that
encompasses the dynamics of pullers, pushers, and neutral swimmers in the
neighbourhood of flat, concave, and convex walls. In addition, the combined
effect of oppositely curved surfaces is studied by confining the squirmer in an
annulus. The results presented in a unified framework and insights obtained are
expected to be useful to design geometrical confinements to control and guide
the motion of microswimmers in microfluidic applications.

supply, necessitating a mechanism that selects a subset of transactions to
include ""on-chain"" from the pool of all pending transactions. This paper
investigates the problem of designing a blockchain transaction fee mechanism
through the lens of mechanism design. We introduce two new forms of
incentive-compatibility that capture some of the idiosyncrasies of the
blockchain setting, one (MMIC) that protects against deviations by
profit-maximizing miners and one (OCA-proofness) that protects against
off-chain collusion between miners and users.
  This study is immediately applicable to a recent (August 5, 2021) and major
change to Ethereum's transaction fee mechanism, based on a proposal called
""EIP-1559."" Historically, Ethereum's transaction fee mechanism was a
first-price (pay-as-bid) auction. EIP-1559 suggested making several tightly
coupled changes, including the introduction of variable-size blocks, a
history-dependent reserve price, and the burning of a significant portion of
the transaction fees. We prove that this new mechanism earns an impressive
report card: it satisfies the MMIC and OCA-proofness conditions, and is also
dominant-strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) except when there is a sudden
demand spike. We also introduce an alternative design, the ""tipless mechanism,""
which offers an incomparable slate of incentive-compatibility guarantees -- it
is MMIC and DSIC, and OCA-proof unless in the midst of a demand spike.

Fe$_{1/3+\delta}$NbS$_2$ has been found to possess intriguing resistance
switching and magnetic memory effects coupled to the N\'{e}el temperature of
T$_N \sim 45$ K [1,2]. We present comprehensive single crystal neutron
diffraction measurements on under-intercalated ($\delta \sim -0.01$),
stoichiometric, and over-intercalated ($\delta \sim 0.01$) samples. Magnetic
defects are usually considered to suppress magnetic correlations and,
concomitantly, transition temperatures. Instead, we observe highly tunable
magnetic long-ranged states as the Fe concentration is varied from
under-intercalated to over-intercalated, that is from Fe vacancies to Fe
interstitials. The under- and over- intercalated samples reveal distinct
antiferromagnetic stripe and zig-zag orders, associated with wave vectors $k_1$
= (0.5, 0, 0) and $k_2$ = (0.25, 0.5, 0), respectively. The stoichiometric
sample shows two successive magnetic phase transitions for these two wave
vectors with an unusual rise-and-fall feature in the intensities connected to
$k_1$. We ascribe this sensitive tunability to the competing next nearest
neighbor exchange interactions and the oscillatory nature of the
Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) mechanism. We discuss experimental
observations that relate to the observed intriguing switching resistance
behaviors. Our discovery of a magnetic defect tuning of the magnetic structure

the density and the lensing contribution to the number counts, especially for
redshift bins that are far apart. Correlating the number counts with the
convergence map we find that the signal is dominated by the lensing-lensing

preserves its shape and ""velocity"" except for a position shift of principal

over explicit knowledge in the form of natural language facts and rules (Clark
et al., 2020). A recent work, named PRover (Saha et al., 2020), performs such
reasoning by answering a question and also generating a proof graph that
explains the answer. However, compositional reasoning is not always unique and
there may be multiple ways of reaching the correct answer. Thus, in our work,
we address a new and challenging problem of generating multiple proof graphs
for reasoning over natural language rule-bases. Each proof provides a different
rationale for the answer, thereby improving the interpretability of such
reasoning systems. In order to jointly learn from all proof graphs and exploit
the correlations between multiple proofs for a question, we pose this task as a
set generation problem over structured output spaces where each proof is
represented as a directed graph. We propose two variants of a proof-set
generation model, multiPRover. Our first model, Multilabel-multiPRover,
generates a set of proofs via multi-label classification and implicit
conditioning between the proofs; while the second model, Iterative-multiPRover,
generates proofs iteratively by explicitly conditioning on the previously
generated proofs. Experiments on multiple synthetic, zero-shot, and
human-paraphrased datasets reveal that both multiPRover models significantly
outperform PRover on datasets containing multiple gold proofs.
Iterative-multiPRover obtains state-of-the-art proof F1 in zero-shot scenarios
where all examples have single correct proofs. It also generalizes better to
questions requiring higher depths of reasoning where multiple proofs are more

periodic signals, whose statistical significance is assessed via false alarm

model might not originate from a strictly periodic source. In astronomy in
particular, one expects transient signals that show periodicity for a certain
amount of time before vanishing. This situation is encountered for instance in
the search for planets in radial velocity data. While planetary signals are
expected to have a stable phase, amplitude and frequency - except when strong
planet-planet interactions are present - signals induced by stellar activity
will typically not exhibit the same stability. In the present article, we
explore the use of periodic functions multiplied by time windows to diagnose
whether an apparently periodic signal is truly so. We suggest diagnostics to
check whether a signal is consistently present in the time series, and has a
stable phase, amplitude and period. The tests are expressed both in a

the characterisation of different types of entanglement. One of the most
fundamental insights is the fact that some mixed states can feature
entanglement across every possible cut of a multipartite system yet can be
produced via a mixture of states separable with respect to different
partitions. To distinguish states that genuinely cannot be produced from mixing
such partition-separable states, the term genuine multipartite entanglement was
coined. All these considerations originate in a paradigm where only a single
copy of the state is distributed and locally acted upon. In contrast, advances
in quantum technologies prompt the question of how this picture changes when
multiple copies of the same state become locally accessible. Here we show that
multiple copies unlock genuine multipartite entanglement from partially
separable states, i.e., mixtures of the partition-separable states, even from
undistillable ensembles, and even more than two copies can be required to
observe this effect. With these findings, we characterise the notion of genuine
multipartite entanglement in the paradigm of multiple copies and conjecture a
strict hierarchy of activatable states and an asymptotic collapse of the

violating the Wilsonian notion of naturalness: despite the absence of any

divergences, or as a delicate cancellation between matching UV and calculable

simple explanation in the full theory: the loop integrand is a total derivative
of a function vanishing in both the deep UV and IR. The leading contribution to
$(g-2)$ arises from dimension-eight operators, and thus the required masses of
new fermions are lower than naively expected, with a sizeable portion of

analytical properties of its Borel transform, as prescribed by resurgence
theory. The final result is then naturally interpreted in terms of the

arbitrary topologies, using the basic gluing rules of the undeformed case. The

strong tidal forces of a supermassive black hole, which results in the
formation of a debris stream that partly falls back towards the compact object.
This gas moves along inclined orbital planes that intersect near pericenter,
resulting in a so-called ""nozzle shock"". We perform the first dedicated study
of this interaction, making use of a two-dimensional simulation that follows
the transverse gas evolution inside a given section of stream. This numerical
approach circumvents the lack of resolution encountered near pericenter passage
in global three-dimensional simulations using particle-based methods. As it
moves inward, we find that the gas motion is purely ballistic, which near
pericenter causes strong vertical compression that squeezes the stream into a
thin sheet. Dissipation takes place at the resulting nozzle shock, inducing a
rise in pressure that causes the collapsing gas to bounce back, although
without imparting significant net expansion. As it recedes to larger distances,
this matter continues to expand while remaining thin despite the influence of
pressure forces. This gas evolution specifies the strength of the subsequent
self-crossing shock, which we find to be more affected by black hole spin than
previously estimated. We also evaluate the impact of general-relativistic
effects, viscous dissipation, magnetic fields and radiative processes on the
nozzle shock. This study represents an important step forward in the
theoretical understanding of TDEs, bridging the gap between our robust
knowledge of the fallback rate and the more complex following stages, during

satellites heat up the dark-matter cusps by dynamical friction, allowing
AGN-driven outflows to generate cores. Using analytic and semi-analytic models
(SatGen), we estimate the dynamical-friction heating as a function of satellite
compactness for a cosmological sequence of mergers. Cosmological simulations
(VELA) demonstrate that satellites of initial virial masses
$>\!10^{11.3}M_\odot$, that undergo wet compactions, become sufficiently
compact for significant heating. Constituting a major fraction of the accretion
onto haloes $\geq\!10^{12}M_\odot$, these satellites heat-up the cusps in half
a virial time at $z\!\sim\! 2$. Using a model for outflow-driven core formation
(CuspCore), we demonstrate that the heated dark-matter cusps develop extended
cores in response to removal of half the gas mass, while the more compact
stellar systems remain intact. The mergers keep the dark matter hot, while the
gas supply, fresh and recycled, is sufficient for the AGN outflows. AGN indeed
become effective in haloes $\geq\!10^{12}M_\odot$, where the black-hole growth
is no longer suppressed by supernovae and its compaction-driven rapid growth is
maintained by a hot CGM. For simulations to reproduce the dynamical-friction
effects, they should resolve the compaction of the massive satellites and avoid
artificial tidal disruption. AGN feedback could be boosted by clumpy black-hole
accretion and clumpy response to AGN.

photoionization models from CLOUDY , we further show that the observed changes

abundances, if the physical conditions of the emitting gas are allowed to vary
over a broad range of densities and ionizing fluxes. The diversity of broad
line emission in quasar spectra can be explained by a model with emission from
two kinematically distinct regions, where the line ratios suggest that these
regions have either very different metallicity or density. Both simplicity and
current galaxy evolution models suggest that near-solar abundances, with parts
of the spectrum forming in high-density clouds, are more likely. Within this
paradigm, objects with stronger outflow signatures show stronger emission from

challenge, particularly in physical situations where a quasiparticle
description is absent. In such situations, however, the many-body Kubo formula
from linear response theory, involving matrix elements of the current operator
computed with many-body wavefunctions, remains valid. Working directly in the
many-body Hilbert space and not making any reference to quasiparticles (or lack
thereof), we address the puzzle of linear in temperature ($T$-linear)
resistivity seen in non-Fermi liquid phases that occur in several strongly
correlated condensed matter systems. We derive a simple criterion for the
occurrence of $T$-linear resistivity based on an analysis of the contributions
to the many-body Kubo formula, determined by an energy invariant ""$f$-function""
involving current matrix elements and energy eigenvalues that describes the DC
conductivity of the system in the microcanonical ensemble. Using full
diagonalization, we test this criterion for the $f$-function in the spinless
nearest neighbor Hubbard model and in a system of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev dots
coupled by weak single particle hopping. We also study the $f$-function for the
spin conductivity in the 2D Heisenberg model and arrive at similar conclusions.
Our work suggests that a general principle, formulated in terms of many-body
Hilbert space concepts, is at the core of the occurrence of $T$-linear
resistivity in a wide range of systems, and precisely translates $T$-linear
resistivity into a notion of energy scale invariance far beyond what is

analyses and experiential heuristics. However, there is no known
general-purpose procedure for rigorously evaluating whether newly proposed
models indeed successfully learn from data. We show that such a procedure
cannot exist. For PAC binary classification, uniform and universal online
learning, and exact learning through teacher-learner interactions, learnability
is in general undecidable, both in the sense of independence of the axioms in a
formal system and in the sense of uncomputability. Our proofs proceed via
computable constructions of function classes that encode the consistency
problem for formal systems and the halting problem for Turing machines into
complexity measures that characterize learnability. Our work shows that
undecidability appears in the theoretical foundations of machine learning:
There is no one-size-fits-all algorithm for deciding whether a machine learning
model can be successful. We cannot in general automatize the process of
assessing new learning models.

(GC) with extreme kinematics, located in the Galactic plane at $l = 10.1477$
deg, $b = 0.2999$ deg. Aims. We aim to characterize the physical properties of
this new GC and place it in the context of the Milky Way, exploring its
possible connection with the known GC NGC 6544 and with the Hrid halo stream.
Methods. VVV-CL160 was originally detected in the VISTA Variables in the V\'ia
L\'actea (VVV) survey. We use the proper motions (PMs) from the updated VVV
Infrared Astrometric Catalog (VIRAC2) to select GC members and make deep
near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) to study the cluster properties.
We also fit King models to the decontaminated sample to determine the GC
structural parameters. Results. VVV-CL160 has an unusually large PM for a
Galactic GC as measured with VIRAC2 and Gaia EDR3: $\mu_{\alpha}\cos(\delta)$ =
$-2.3 \pm 0.1 $ mas yr$^{-1}$ and $\mu_{\delta}$ = $-16.8 \pm 0.1 $ mas
yr$^{-1}$. The kinematics are similar to those of the known GC NGC 6544 and the
Hrid halo stream. We estimate a reddening of $E(J-K) = 1.95$ mag and an
extinction of $A_{k}= 1.40$ mag for VVV-CL160. We also measure a distance
modulus of $(m-M) = 13.01$ mag and a distance of $D_{\odot} = 4.0 \pm 0.5$ kpc.
This places the GC at $z=29$ pc above the Galactic plane and at a
galactocentric distance of $R_G=4.2$ kpc. We also measure a metallicity of
$[Fe/H] = -1.4 \pm 0.2$ dex for an adopted age of $t=12$ Gyr; King model fits
of the PM-decontaminated sample reveal a concentrated GC, with core radius
$r_{c}= 22.8""$ and tidal radius $r_{t}= 50'$. .... We also explore the possible
association of this new GC with other GCs and halo streams. Conclusions. Based
on the locations and kinematics, we suggest that VVV-CL160, along with NGC
6544, may be associated with the extension of the Hrid halo stream.

achieved, several works pointed out that both theoretical as well as
astrophysical arguments would severely dampen the attainable energies. In this
work we study particle collisions near Kerr black holes, by reviewing and
extending the so far proposed scenarios. Most noticeably, we shall focus on the
recently advanced target particle scenarios which were claimed to reach
arbitrarily high energies even for Schwarzschild black holes. By implementing
the hoop conjecture we show that these scenarios involving near-horizon target
particles are in principle able to attain, sub-Planckian, but still ultra-high
center of mass energies of the order of $10^{23}-10^{25}$ eV even for
non-extremal Kerr black holes. Furthermore, analysing the properties of
particles produced in such collisions, we find that photons can escape to
infinity. However, their energy is only of the order of the energy of the
colliding particles and hence relatively low, which is the same conclusion
previously reached in the literature about the original Ba\~nados--Silk--West
process. This finding points towards a general limitation of collisional
Penrose processes, at least for what concerns their primary products.

neutron-star mergers has solidified the importance of multimessenger campaigns
in studying the most energetic astrophysical events. Pioneering multimessenger
observatories, such as LIGO/Virgo and IceCube, record many candidate signals
below the detection significance threshold. These sub-threshold event
candidates are promising targets for multimessenger studies, as the information
provided by them may, when combined with contemporaneous gamma-ray
observations, lead to significant detections. Here we describe a new method
that uses such candidates to search for transient events using archival
very-high-energy gamma-ray data from imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes
(IACTs). We demonstrate the application of this method to sub-threshold binary
neutron star (BNS) merger candidates identified in Advanced LIGO's first
observing run. We identify eight hours of archival VERITAS observations
coincident with seven BNS merger candidates and search them for TeV emission.
No gamma-ray emission is detected; we calculate upper limits on the integral
flux and compare them to a short gamma-ray burst model. We anticipate this
search method to serve as a starting point for IACT searches with future
LIGO/Virgo data releases as well as in other sub-threshold studies for
multimessenger transients, such as IceCube neutrinos. Furthermore, it can be
deployed immediately with other current-generation IACTs, and has the potential
for real-time use that places minimal burden on experimental operations.
Lastly, this method may serve as a pilot for studies with the Cherenkov
Telescope Array, which has the potential to observe even larger fields of view
in its divergent pointing mode.

CHIMERA models, and a 10-$M_{\odot}$ solar-metallicity progenitor starting from
a 2D CHIMERA model, all simulated until shock breakout in 3D while tracking 160
nuclear species. The relative velocity difference between the supernova shock
and the metal-rich Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) ""bullets"" determines how the
metal-rich ejecta evolves as it propagates through the density profile of the
progenitor and dictates the final morphology of the explosion. We find maximum
$^{56}\rm{Ni}$ velocities of ${\sim} 1950~\rm{km~s}^{-1}$ and ${\sim}
1750~\rm{km~s}^{-1}$ at shock breakout from 2D and 3D 9.6-$M_{\odot}$ CHIMERA

When mapping from 2D, we find that the development of higher velocity
structures is suppressed when the 2D CHIMERA model and 3D FLASH model meshes
are aligned. The development of faster growing spherical-bubble structures, as
opposed to the slower growing toroidal structure imposed by axisymmetry, allows
for interaction of the bullets with the shock and seeds further R-T
instabilities at the He/H interface. We see similar effects in the
10-$M_{\odot}$ model, which achieves maximum $^{56}\rm{Ni}$ velocities of
${\sim} 2500~\rm{km~s}^{-1}$ at shock breakout.

high-spatial-resolution, time-resolved, precise, accurate astrometric, and
photometric survey of the entire sky.
  Aims: We present the Gaia Science Alerts project, which has been in operation
since 1 June 2016. We describe the system which has been developed to enable
the discovery and publication of transient photometric events as seen by Gaia.
  Methods: We outline the data handling, timings, and performances, and we
describe the transient detection algorithms and filtering procedures needed to
manage the high false alarm rate. We identify two classes of events: (1)
sources which are new to Gaia and (2) Gaia sources which have undergone a
significant brightening or fading. Validation of the Gaia transit astrometry
and photometry was performed, followed by testing of the source environment to
minimise contamination from Solar System objects, bright stars, and fainter
near-neighbours.
  Results: We show that the Gaia Science Alerts project suffers from very low
contamination, that is there are very few false-positives. We find that the
external completeness for supernovae, $C_E=0.46$, is dominated by the Gaia
scanning law and the requirement of detections from both fields-of-view. Where
we have two or more scans the internal completeness is $C_I=0.79$ at 3 arcsec
or larger from the centres of galaxies, but it drops closer in, especially

  Conclusions: The per-transit photometry for Gaia transients is precise to 1
per cent at $G=13$, and 3 per cent at $G=19$. The per-transit astrometry is
accurate to 55 milliarcseconds when compared to Gaia DR2. The Gaia Science
Alerts project is one of the most homogeneous and productive transient surveys
in operation, and it is the only survey which covers the whole sky at high
spatial resolution (subarcsecond), including the Galactic plane and bulge.

estimates of their stellar and orbital parameters. Whereas black hole+O (BH+O)
binaries are thought to evolve from the former, only one such system is known
in the Milky Way. To resolve this disparity, it was suggested that upon core
collapse, the WR stars receive large kicks such that most of the binaries are
disrupted. We reassess this issue, with emphasis on the uncertainty in the
formation of an accretion disk around wind-accreting BHs in BH+O binaries,
which is key to identifying such systems. We follow the methodology of previous
work and apply an improved analytic criterion for the formation of an accretion
disk around wind accreting BHs. We then use stellar models to predict the
properties of the BH+O binaries which are expected to descend from the observed
WR+O binaries, if the WR stars would form BHs without a natal kick. We find
that disk formation depends sensitively on the O stars' wind velocity, the
specific angular momentum carried by the wind, the efficiency of angular
momentum accretion by the BH, and the spin of the BH. We show that the
assumption of a low wind velocity may lead to predicting that most of the BH+O
star binaries will have an extended X-ray bright period. However, this is not
the case when typical wind velocities of O stars are considered. We find that a
high spin of the BH can boost the duration of the X-ray active phase as well as
the X-ray brightness during this phase, producing a strong bias for detecting
high mass BH binaries in X-rays with high BH spin parameters. We conclude that
large BH formation kicks are not required to understand the sparsity of X-ray
bright BH+O stars in the Milky Way. Probing for a population of X-ray silent
BH+O systems with alternative methods can inform us about BH kicks and the
conditions for high energy emission from high mass BH binaries. (Abridged)

a steeper increase in emission at the lower frequency compared with conal
emission, with an average difference in spectral index
$\delta\alpha_{core-cone}\sim-0.7$ between the core and the conal components in
this frequency range. In contrast the inner conal components had positive

perspective allows us to: (1) derive simple but unexplored variants of GCRL to
study how adding small representation capacity can already expand its
capabilities; (2) investigate how discriminator function capacity and
smoothness determine the quality of discovered skills, or latent goals, through
modifying latent dimensionality and applying spectral normalization; (3) adapt

undergone by a particle hopping on a one dimensional lattice where the pinning
forces at each site are independent and identically distributed (I.I.D), each
drawn from a continuous $f(x)$. The avalanches in this model correspond to the
inter-record intervals in a modified record process of I.I.D variables, defined
by a single parameter $c>0$. This parameter characterizes the record formation
via the recursive process $R_k > R_{k-1}-c$, where $R_k$ denotes the value of
the $k$-th record. We show that for $c>0$, if $f(x)$ decays slower than an
exponential for large $x$, the record process is nonstationary as in the
standard $c=0$ case. In contrast, if $f(x)$ has a faster than exponential tail,
the record process becomes stationary and the avalanche size distribution
$\pi(n)$ has a decay faster than $1/n^2$ for large $n$. The marginal case where
$f(x)$ decays exponentially for large $x$ exhibits a phase transition from a
non-stationary phase to a stationary phase as $c$ increases through a critical
value $c_{\rm crit}$. Focusing on $f(x)=e^{-x}$ (with $x\ge 0$), we show that
$c_{\rm crit}=1$ and for $c<1$, the record statistics is non-stationary.
However, for $c>1$, the record statistics is stationary with avalanche size
distribution $\pi(n)\sim n^{-1-\lambda(c)}$ for large $n$. Consequently, for
$c>1$, the mean number of records up to $N$ steps grows algebraically $\sim
N^{\lambda(c)}$ for large $N$. Remarkably, the exponent $\lambda(c)$ depends
continously on $c$ for $c>1$ and is given by the unique positive root of
$c=-\ln (1-\lambda)/\lambda$. We also unveil the presence of nontrivial
correlations between avalanches in the stationary phase that resemble
earthquake sequences.

efficiently performed via maximum likelihood. However, data of interest are
typically assumed to live in some (often unknown) low-dimensional manifold
embedded in a high-dimensional ambient space. The result is a modelling
mismatch since -- by construction -- the invertibility requirement implies
high-dimensional support of the learned distribution. Injective flows, mappings
from low- to high-dimensional spaces, aim to fix this discrepancy by learning
distributions on manifolds, but the resulting volume-change term becomes more
challenging to evaluate. Current approaches either avoid computing this term
entirely using various heuristics, or assume the manifold is known beforehand
and therefore are not widely applicable. Instead, we propose two methods to
tractably calculate the gradient of this term with respect to the parameters of
the model, relying on careful use of automatic differentiation and techniques
from numerical linear algebra. Both approaches perform end-to-end nonlinear
manifold learning and density estimation for data projected onto this manifold.
We study the trade-offs between our proposed methods, empirically verify that
we outperform approaches ignoring the volume-change term by more accurately
learning manifolds and the corresponding distributions on them, and show
promising results on out-of-distribution detection. Our code is available at

approach for DVC, which is highly flexible in that no normal speech of the
patient is required. First, a powerful parallel sequence-to-sequence model
converts the input dysarthric speech into a normal speech of a reference
speaker as an intermediate product, and a nonparallel, frame-wise VC model
realized with a variational autoencoder then converts the speaker identity of
the reference speech back to that of the patient while assumed to be capable of

Experimental evaluation results demonstrate the potential of our approach to
improving the quality of the dysarthric speech while maintaining the speaker

propagating the disease through the virus, a new bio-inspired and
population-based optimization algorithm is proposed. This paper presents a
novel metaheuristic algorithm named Ebola optimization algorithm (EOSA). To
correctly achieve this, this study models the propagation mechanism of the
Ebola virus disease, emphasising all consistent states of the propagation. The
model was further represented using a mathematical model based on first-order
differential equations. After that, the combined propagation and mathematical
models were adapted for developing the new metaheuristic algorithm. To evaluate
the proposed method's performance and capability compared with other
optimization methods, the underlying propagation and mathematical models were
first investigated to determine how they successfully simulate the EVD.
Furthermore, two sets of benchmark functions consisting of forty-seven (47)
classical and over thirty (30) constrained IEEE CEC-2017 benchmark functions
are investigated numerically. The results indicate that the performance of the
proposed algorithm is competitive with other state-of-the-art optimization
methods based on scalability analysis, convergence analysis, and sensitivity
analysis. Extensive simulation results indicate that the EOSA outperforms other

Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm (ABC) on some shifted, high dimensional and

error-cost bound which tightly constrains the performance of proofreading

communication-efficient FL with SSL. To address this issue, we propose
alternate training to `fine-tune global model with labeled data' and `generate
pseudo-labels with the global model.' We conduct extensive experiments and
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the performance of a
labeled server with unlabeled clients training with multiple local epochs.
Moreover, our method outperforms many existing SSFL baselines and performs
competitively with the state-of-the-art FL and SSL results.

problems we face as we try to illuminate the Earth using recorded seismic data.
The Helmholtz equation provides wavefield solutions that are dimensionally
reduced, per frequency, compared to the time domain, which is useful for many
applications, like full waveform inversion (FWI). However, our ability to
attain such wavefield solutions depends often on the size of the model and the
complexity of the wave equation. Thus, we use here a recently introduced
framework based on neural networks to predict functional solutions through
setting the underlying physical equation as a loss function to optimize the
neural network parameters. For an input given by a location in the model space,
the network learns to predict the wavefield value at that location, and its
partial derivatives using a concept referred to as automatic differentiation,
to fit, in our case, a form of the Helmholtz equation. We specifically seek the
solution of the scattered wavefield considering a simple homogeneous background
model that allows for analytical solutions of the background wavefield.
Providing the neural network (NN) a reasonable number of random points from the
model space will ultimately train a fully connected deep NN to predict the
scattered wavefield function. The size of the network depends mainly on the
complexity of the desired wavefield, with such complexity increasing with
increasing frequency and increasing model complexity. However, smaller networks
can provide smoother wavefields that might be useful for inversion
applications. Preliminary tests on a two-box-shaped scatterer model with a
source in the middle, as well as, the Marmousi model with a source on the
surface demonstrate the potential of the NN for this application. Additional
tests on a 3D model demonstrate the potential versatility of the approach.

primordial black holes are generated with very low spins. However, it is worth
studying if they can increase their spin throughout the evolution of the

black hole mergers and gas accretion. We propose here a new mechanism that can
occur in dense clusters of black holes: the spin-up of primordial black holes
when they are involved in close hyperbolic encounters. We explore this effect
numerically with the Einstein Toolkit for different initial conditions,
including variable mass ratios. For equal masses, there is a maximum spin that
can be induced on the black holes, $\chi = a/m \leq 0.2$. We find however that
for large mass ratios one can attain spins up to $\chi \simeq 0.8$, where the
highest spin is induced on the most massive black hole. For small induced spins
we provide simple analytical expressions that depend on the relative velocity

$\Lambda$CDM, we consider isolated fuzzy-dark-matter lumps, made of ultralight
axion particles whose masses arise due to distinct SU(2) Yang-Mills scales and
the Planck mass $M_P$. In contrast to SU(2)$_{\rm CMB}$, these Yang-Mills
theories are in confining phases (zero temperature) throughout most of the
Universe's history and associate with the three lepton flavours of the Standard
Model of particle physics. As the Universe expands, axionic fuzzy dark matter
comprises a three-component fluid which undergoes certain depercolation
transitions when dark energy (a global axion condensate) is converted into dark
matter. We extract the lightest axion mass $m_{a,e}= 0.675\times 10^{-23}\,$eV
from well motivated model fits to observed rotation curves in
low-surface-brightness galaxies (SPARC catalogue). Since the virial mass of an
isolated lump solely depends on $M_P$ and the associated Yang-Mills scale the
properties of an e-lump predict those of $\mu$- and $\tau$-lumps. As a result,
a typical e-lump virial mass $\sim 6.3\times 10^{10}\,M_\odot$ suggests that
massive compact objects in galactic centers such as Sagittarius A$^*$ in the
Milky Way are (merged) $\mu$- and $\tau$-lumps. In addition, $\tau$-lumps may
constitute globular clusters. SU(2)$_{\rm CMB}$ is always thermalised, and its
axion condensate never has depercolated. If the axial anomaly indeed would link
leptons with dark matter and the CMB with dark energy then this would demystify
the dark Universe through a firmly established feature of particle physics.

We propose ""PS3"", a three-step algorithm for mixed-integer nonlinear optimal

pseudo-spectral collocation theory for highly accurate modeling of dynamics.
Based on the validated powertrain component models, we have addressed
simultaneous optimization of electrical (SOC), vehicular (eco-driving) and
thermal (after-treatment and battery temperatures) dynamics along with an
integer (gear and engine on/off) control and its corresponding (dwell-time)
constraints. PS3 is used to solve such large-scale powertrain problems having
fast and slow dynamic states, discontinuous behaviors, non-differentiable and
linearly interpolated 1-D and 2-D maps, as well as combinatorial constraints.
Five case study powertrain control problems are given to benchmark the accuracy
and computational effort against Dynamic Programming. Our analysis shows that
this algorithm does not scale computational burden as Dynamic Programming does,

We describe our aisles in terms of stalks at function fields and prove that

the filtrations on the ""homotopy hearts"" $Ht_{hom}^{eff}$ of the corresponding
effective subcategories that are induced by these aisles can be described in
terms of (Nisnevich) sheaf cohomology as well as in terms of the Voevodsky
contractions $-_{-1}$. Respectively, we express the condition for an object of
$Ht_{hom}^{eff}$ to be weakly birational (i.e., that its $n+1$th contraction is
trivial or, equivalently, the Nisnevich cohomology vanishes in degrees $>n$ for
some $n\ge 0$) in terms of these aisles; this statement generalizes well-known
results of Kahn and Sujatha. Next, these classes define weight structures
$w_{Smooth}^{s}$ (where $s=(s_{j})$ are non-decreasing sequences parameterizing

electrostatic and surface energy of a deformable droplet. The model predicts
that the ion is subject to a harmonic potential centered at the droplet's
center of mass. We name this effect ""electrostatic confinement"". The model's
predictions are consistent with the simulation findings for a single ion at
room temperature but not at supercooling. We anticipate this study to be the
starting point for investigating the structure of supercooled (electro)sprayed
droplets that are used to preserve the conformations of macromolecules
originating from the bulk solution.

dynamics of mental health language, finding that the popularity of the phrase
'mental health' increased by nearly two orders of magnitude between 2012 and
2018. We observe that mentions of 'mental health' spike annually and reliably
due to mental health awareness campaigns, as well as unpredictably in response
to mass shootings, celebrities dying by suicide, and popular fictional stories
portraying suicide. We find that the level of positivity of messages containing
'mental health', while stable through the growth period, has declined recently.
Finally, we use the ratio of original tweets to retweets to quantify the
fraction of appearances of mental health language due to social amplification.
Since 2015, mentions of mental health have become increasingly due to retweets,
suggesting that stigma associated with discussion of mental health on Twitter
has diminished with time.

creates high demand for efficient and high performance datacenter networking
stacks, optimized for fine-grained workloads. Commodity networking systems
based on software stacks and peripheral NICs introduce high overheads when it
comes to delivering small messages.
  We present Dagger, a hardware acceleration fabric for cloud RPCs based on
FPGAs, where the accelerator is closely-coupled with the host processor over a
configurable memory interconnect. The three key design principle of Dagger are:
(1) offloading the entire RPC stack to an FPGA-based NIC, (2) leveraging memory
interconnects instead of PCIe buses as the interface with the host CPU, and (3)
making the acceleration fabric reconfigurable, so it can accommodate the
diverse needs of microservices. We show that the combination of these
principles significantly improves the efficiency and performance of cloud RPC
systems while preserving their generality. Dagger achieves 1.3-3.8x higher
per-core RPC throughput compared to both highly-optimized software stacks, and
systems using specialized RDMA adapters. It also scales up to 84 Mrps with 8
threads on 4 CPU cores, while maintaining state-of-the-art us-scale tail
latency. We also demonstrate that large third-party applications, like
memcached and MICA KVS, can be easily ported on Dagger with minimal changes to
their codebase, bringing their median and tail KVS access latency down to 2.8 -
3.5us and 5.4 - 7.8us, respectively. Finally, we show that Dagger is beneficial
for multi-tier end-to-end microservices with different threading models by
evaluating it using an 8-tier application implementing a flight check-in
service.

accurate. In this work, we propose a novel method for Learning Low-dimensional
binary Codes (LLC) for instances as well as classes. Our method does not
require any side-information, like annotated attributes or label meta-data, and
learns extremely low-dimensional binary codes (~20 bits for ImageNet-1K). The
learnt codes are super-efficient while still ensuring nearly optimal
classification accuracy for ResNet50 on ImageNet-1K. We demonstrate that the
learnt codes capture intrinsically important features in the data, by
discovering an intuitive taxonomy over classes. We further quantitatively
measure the quality of our codes by applying it to the efficient image
retrieval as well as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problems. For
ImageNet-100 retrieval problem, our learnt binary codes outperform 16 bit
HashNet using only 10 bits and also are as accurate as 10 dimensional real

that under a computational budget, the max-player can not fully maximize
$f(x,\cdot)$ since nonconcave maximization is NP-hard in general. So, we
propose a new algorithm for the min-player to play against smooth algorithms
deployed by the adversary (i.e., the max-player) instead of against full
maximization. Our algorithm is guaranteed to make monotonic progress (thus
having no limit cycles), and to find an appropriate ""stationary point"" in a
polynomial number of iterations. Our framework covers practical settings where
the smooth algorithms deployed by the adversary are multi-step stochastic
gradient ascent, and its accelerated version. We further provide complementing

improving the reliability of a model where the knowledge is from (i.e.,

However, how to effectively predict user engagement in the context of mobile

dwell time? Answers to such questions could help mobile operating system and

first conduct an empirical study for assessing how user characteristics,

predicting users' app dwell time on the population level. The comprehensive

time, or the fraction of jobs that complete in under one second? Is FCFS still
best? Outside of the asymptotic regime, only loose bounds on the tail of FCFS

provably stochastically improve upon FCFS. We prove that Nudge simultaneously
improves upon FCFS at every point along the tail, for light-tailed job size

improvement over FCFS in the asymptotic tail. This resolves a long-standing

have gained popularity in public and government domains. This usually requires
capturing and consolidating data from multiple sources. As datasets do not
necessarily originate from identical sensors, fused data typically results in a
complex data problem. Because military is investigating how heterogeneous IoT
devices can aid processes and tasks, we investigate a multi-sensor approach.
Moreover, we propose a signal to image encoding approach to transform
information (signal) to integrate (fuse) data from IoT wearable devices to an
image which is invertible and easier to visualize supporting decision making.
Furthermore, we investigate the challenge of enabling an intelligent
identification and detection operation and demonstrate the feasibility of the
proposed Deep Learning and Anomaly Detection models that can support future
application that utilizes hand gesture data from wearable devices.

chaos with slow mixing rates, but have been notoriously resistant to numerical
study. In this paper we present an effective framework to compute many ergodic
properties of these systems, in particular invariant measures and mean return
times. The framework combines three ingredients that each harness the smooth
structure of these systems' induced maps: Abel functions to compute the action
of the induced maps, Euler-Maclaurin summation to compute the pointwise action
of their transfer operators, and Chebyshev Galerkin discretisations to compute
the spectral data of the transfer operators. The combination of these
techniques allows one to obtain exponential convergence of estimates for
polynomially growing computational outlay, independent of the order of the
map's neutral fixed point. This enables numerical exploration of intermittent
dynamics in all parameter regimes, including in the infinite ergodic regime.

from fragmented context: information describing a single entity can be
scattered across multiple datasets or tables tailored for specific business
needs, with no explicit linking keys (e.g., primary key-foreign key
relationships or heuristic functions). Context enrichment, or rebuilding
fragmented context, using keyless joins is an implicit or explicit step in
machine learning (ML) pipelines over structured data sources. This process is
tedious, domain-specific, and lacks support in now-prevalent no-code ML systems

configuration files. In response, we propose Ember, a system that abstracts and
automates keyless joins to generalize context enrichment. Our key insight is
that Ember can enable a general keyless join operator by constructing an index
populated with task-specific embeddings. Ember learns these embeddings by
leveraging Transformer-based representation learning techniques. We describe
our core architectural principles and operators when developing Ember, and
empirically demonstrate that Ember allows users to develop no-code pipelines

compute both, the spectrum of plane waves and the mean square displacement

regularized hypergeometric functions and the fractional exponent. The MSD shows
ballistic behavior at long times, MSD$\sim t^2$ for all fractional exponents.

fundamental prerequisite for implementing explainable intelligent systems in

proposing a formative architecture that defines the explanation space from a
user-inspired perspective. The architecture comprises five intertwined
components to outline explanation requirements for a task: (1) the end-users
mental models, (2) the end-users cognitive process, (3) the user interface, (4)
the human-explainer agent, and the (5) agent process. We first define each

designers in systematically aligning explanations with the end-users work
practices, needs, and goals. It guides the specifications of what needs to be
explained (content - end-users mental model), why this explanation is necessary
(context - end-users cognitive process), to delimit how to explain it (format -

given. We then exemplify the tool's use in an ongoing case study in the
aircraft maintenance domain. Finally, we discuss possible contributions of the

the mechanics of deep attention-based neural networks like the Transformer

towards understanding how Transformers work. In particular, we show that the
""dot-product attention"" that is the core of the Transformer's operation can be
characterized as a kernel learning method on a pair of Banach spaces. In
particular, the Transformer's kernel is characterized as having an infinite
feature dimension. Along the way we consider an extension of the standard
kernel learning problem to a binary setting, where data come from two input
domains and a response is defined for every cross-domain pair. We prove a new
representer theorem for these binary kernel machines with non-Mercer
(indefinite, asymmetric) kernels (implying that the functions learned are
elements of reproducing kernel Banach spaces rather than Hilbert spaces), and
also prove a new universal approximation theorem showing that the Transformer
calculation can learn any binary non-Mercer reproducing kernel Banach space
pair. We experiment with new kernels in Transformers, and obtain results that
suggest the infinite dimensionality of the standard Transformer kernel is
partially responsible for its performance. This paper's results provide a new

solutions for the shape and external force as functions of the separation of
the rings, analogous to the infinite family of eigenmodes for the Euler
buckling of a slender rod. Special attention is paid to the catenoid, which
emerges as the shape of maximal allowable separation when the area is less than
a critical area equal to the planar area enclosed by the two rings. A
perturbation theory argument directly relates the tension of catenoidal
membranes to the stability of catenoidal soap films in this regime. When the
membrane area is larger than the critical area, we find additional cylindrical
tether solutions to the shape equations at large ring separation, and that
arbitrarily large ring separations are possible. These results apply for the
case of vanishing Gaussian curvature modulus; when the Gaussian curvature
modulus is nonzero and the area is below the critical area, the force and the

Gabor ETF is an important special case of the Zauner conjecture. It is known
that generically all Gabor FUNTFs lead to informationally complete POVMs. In
this paper, we initiate a classification of non-complete Gabor POVMs. In the

three key challenges of high dimensionality, unknown dynamics, and
nonlinearity. The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has emerged as a cornerstone
for modeling high-dimensional systems from data. However, the quality of the
linear DMD model is known to be fragile with respect to strong nonlinearity,
which contaminates the model estimate. In contrast, sparse identification of
nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) learns fully nonlinear models, disambiguating the
linear and nonlinear effects, but is restricted to low-dimensional systems. In
this work, we present a kernel method that learns interpretable data-driven
models for high-dimensional, nonlinear systems. Our method performs kernel
regression on a sparse dictionary of samples that appreciably contribute to the
underlying dynamics. We show that this kernel method efficiently handles
high-dimensional data and is flexible enough to incorporate partial knowledge
of system physics. It is possible to accurately recover the linear model
contribution with this approach, disambiguating the effects of the implicitly
defined nonlinear terms, resulting in a DMD-like model that is robust to
strongly nonlinear dynamics. We demonstrate our approach on data from a wide
range of nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations that arise in
the physical sciences. This framework can be used for many practical
engineering tasks such as model order reduction, diagnostics, prediction,
control, and discovery of governing laws.

the GIZMO hydrodynamics code and perform test cosmological simulations with
different choices of model parameters and numerical resolution. PhEW adopts an
explicit subgrid model that treats each wind particle as a collection of clouds
that exchange mass, metals, and momentum with their surroundings and evaporate
by conduction and hydrodynamic instabilities as calibrated on much higher
resolution cloud scale simulations. In contrast to a conventional wind
algorithm, we find that PhEW results are robust to numerical resolution and
implementation details because the small scale interactions are defined by the
model itself. Compared to conventional wind simulations with the same
resolution, our PhEW simulations produce similar galaxy stellar mass functions
at $z\geq 1$ but are in better agreement with low-redshift observations at $M_*
< 10^{11}M_\odot$ because PhEW particles shed mass to the CGM before escaping
low mass halos. PhEW radically alters the CGM metal distribution because PhEW
particles disperse metals to the ambient medium as their clouds dissipate,
producing a CGM metallicity distribution that is skewed but unimodal and is
similar between cold and hot gas. While the temperature distributions and
radial profiles of gaseous halos are similar in simulations with PhEW and
conventional winds, these changes in metal distribution will affect their
predicted UV/X-ray properties in absorption and emission.

To address these limitations, architected electrodes composed of unit cells

then determined via computational design optimization to generate architected

operating flow rates and currents. The design methodology is further used to
generate a scaled-up electrode with comparable power efficiency to the

little about how they actually form summaries and how to understand where their
decisions come from. We propose a two-step method to interpret summarization
model decisions. We first analyze the model's behavior by ablating the full
model to categorize each decoder decision into one of several generation modes:
roughly, is the model behaving like a language model, is it relying heavily on
the input, or is it somewhere in between? After isolating decisions that do
depend on the input, we explore interpreting these decisions using several
different attribution methods. We compare these techniques based on their
ability to select content and reconstruct the model's predicted token from
perturbations of the input, thus revealing whether highlighted attributions are
truly important for the generation of the next token. While this machinery can
be broadly useful even beyond summarization, we specifically demonstrate its
capability to identify phrases the summarization model has memorized and
determine where in the training pipeline this memorization happened, as well as
study complex generation phenomena like sentence fusion on a per-instance
basis.

it is yet to be investigated how doing so compares to only using each partner's
own behavior in terms of emotion prediction performance. In this work, we used
BERT to extract linguistic features (i.e., what partners said) and openSMILE to
extract paralinguistic features (i.e., how they said it) from a data set of 368
German-speaking Swiss couples (N = 736 individuals) who were videotaped during

we trained machine learning models to predict if partners feel positive or
negative after the conflict interaction. Our results show that including the
behavior of the other partner improves the prediction performance. Furthermore,
for men, considering how their female partners spoke is most important and for
women considering what their male partner said is most important in getting
better prediction performance. This work is a step towards automatically
recognizing each partners' emotion based on the behavior of both, which would
enable a better understanding of couples in research, therapy, and the real

reasons. First, these methods often learn inaccurate models of features.
Second, the ""swap"" property, which is required for knockoffs to be valid, is

perform controlled feature selection that does not suffer from either of these
two problems. To more accurately model the features, FlowSelect uses
normalizing flows, the state-of-the-art method for density estimation. Instead
of enforcing the ""swap"" property, FlowSelect uses a novel MCMC-based procedure
to calculate p-values for each feature directly. Asymptotically, FlowSelect
computes valid p-values. Empirically, FlowSelect consistently controls the FDR
on both synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks, whereas competing
knockoff-based approaches do not. FlowSelect also demonstrates greater power on
these benchmarks. Additionally, FlowSelect correctly infers the genetic
variants associated with specific soybean traits from GWAS data.

origin of their processing subsequent to their formation: a slight preference
for left-handedness in some of them, and isotopic anomalies in some of their
constituent atoms. In this article we present theoretical results from the
Supernova Neutrino Amino Acid Processing (SNAAP) model, which uses electron
anti-neutrinos and the magnetic fields from source objects such as supernovae
or colliding neutron stars to selectively destroy one amino acid chirality and
to create isotopic abundance shifts. For plausible magnetic fields and electron
anti-neutrino fluxes, non-zero, positive enantiomeric excesses, $ee$s, defined
to be the relative left/right asymmetry in an amino acid population, are
reviewed for two amino acids, and conditions are suggested that would produce
$ee>0$ for all of the $\alpha$-amino acids. The relatively high energy
anti-neutrinos that produce the $ee$s would inevitably also produce isotopic
anomalies. A nuclear reaction network was developed to describe the reactions
resulting from them and the nuclides in the meteorites. At similar
anti-neutrino fluxes, assumed recombination of the detritus from the
anti-neutrino interactions is shown to produce appreciable isotopic anomalies
in qualitative agreement with those observed for D/$^1$H and $^{15}$N/$^{14}$N.
The isotopic anomalies for $^{13}$C/$^{12}$C are predicted to be small, as are
also observed. Autocatalysis may be necessary for any model to produce the
largest $ee$s observed in meteorites. This allows the constraints of the
original SNAAP model to be relaxed, increasing the probability of meteoroid
survival in sites where amino acid processing is possible. These results have
obvious implications for the origin of life on Earth.

Earth will have first been disrupted by passage inside the Sun's Roche limit,
generating thousands of fragments, each the needed size of the Chicxulub
impactor. This would increase the impact rate of comets by a factor ~15, making
them as likely to hit the Earth as an asteroid. They also argue that a comet
would be a factor of 10 more likely to match the geochemical constraints, which
indicate the Chicxulub impactor was carbonaceous chondrite-like. These
conclusions are based on misinterpretations of the literature. Siraj & Loeb [1]
overestimate the number of fragments produced during tidal disruption of a

'carbonaceous chondrite' with specific types of carbonaceous chondrite, and
ignore the evidence of iridium, making comets seem more likely than asteroids
to match the Chicxulub impactor, when in fact they likely can be ruled out.
Rather than a comet, an asteroidal impactor similar to CM or CR carbonaceous

primarily model the matching relationship between query and moment by complex

exploit dataset biases while ignoring the video content, thus leading to poor
generalizability. We argue that the issue is caused by the hidden confounder in
VMR, {i.e., temporal location of moments}, that spuriously correlates the model
input and prediction. How to design robust matching models against the temporal
location biases is crucial but, as far as we know, has not been studied yet for
VMR.
  To fill the research gap, we propose a causality-inspired VMR framework that
builds structural causal model to capture the true effect of query and video
content on the prediction. Specifically, we develop a Deconfounded Cross-modal
Matching (DCM) method to remove the confounding effects of moment location. It
first disentangles moment representation to infer the core feature of visual
content, and then applies causal intervention on the disentangled multimodal
input based on backdoor adjustment, which forces the model to fairly
incorporate each possible location of the target into consideration. Extensive
experiments clearly show that our approach can achieve significant improvement

in natural language processing such as BERT could enable the development of
systems to potentially automate behavioral coding, which in turn could
substantially improve psychological research. In this work, we train machine
learning models to automatically predict positive and negative communication
behavioral codes of 368 German-speaking Swiss couples during an 8-minute
conflict interaction on a fine-grained scale (10-seconds sequences) using
linguistic features and paralinguistic features derived with openSMILE. Our
results show that both simpler TF-IDF features as well as more complex BERT
features performed better than LIWC, and that adding paralinguistic features
did not improve the performance. These results suggest it might be time to
consider modern alternatives to LIWC, the de facto linguistic features in
psychology, for prediction tasks in couples research. This work is a further
step towards the automated coding of couples' behavior which could enhance
couple research and therapy, and be utilized for other dyadic interactions as
well.

extremely challenging. Existing norm minimisation adversarial attacks require
thousands of iterations (e.g. Carlini & Wagner attack), are limited to the
specific norms (e.g. Fast Adaptive Boundary), or produce sub-optimal results

general and accurate, ignores the norm minimisation penalty and solves a
simpler perturbation-constrained problem. In this work, we introduce a fast,

constrained minimisation problem. We interpret optimising the Lagrangian of the
adversarial attack optimisation problem as a two-player game: the first player
minimises the Lagrangian wrt the adversarial noise; the second player maximises
the Lagrangian wrt the regularisation penalty. Our attack algorithm
simultaneously optimises primal and dual variables to find the minimal
adversarial perturbation. In addition, for non-smooth $l_p$-norm minimisation,

is extraordinary time-consuming and limited in low Reynolds number and simple
geometric configuration. In addition, numerical simulations are difficult to

network, the Reynolds Average Navier-Stokes (RANS) equation, by implanting an
additional turbulent eddy viscosity, coupled with structure's dynamic motion
equation are also embedded into the loss function. Training and validation data
is obtained by computational fluid dynamic (CFD) technique. Three scenarios are
proposed to validate the performance of PINN in solving VIV and WIV of

are calculated via limited force data and displacement data; secondly, the flow
field and lifting force/drag force are inferred by scattered velocity
information; eventually, the displacement can be directly predicted only

and low terahertz (THz) bands has been envisioned as a promising technology,
since it incorporates high-rate data transmission of hundreds of Gbps and
mm-level radar sensing in a spectrum- and cost-efficient manner, by sharing
both the frequency and hardware resources. However, the joint radar sensing and
communication (JRC) system faces considerable challenges in the mmWave and
low-THz scale, due to the peculiarities of the propagation channel and
radio-frequency (RF) front ends. To this end, the waveform design for the JRC
systems in mmWave and low-THz bands with ultra-broad bandwidth is investigated
in this paper. Firstly, by considering the JRC design based on the co-existence
concept, where both functions operate in a time-domain duplex (TDD) manner, a
novel multi-subband quasi-perfect (MS-QP) sequence, composed of multiple
perfect subsequences on different subbands, is proposed for target sensing,
which achieves accurate target ranging and velocity estimation, whilst only
requiring cost-efficient low-rate analog-to-digital converters (A/Ds) for
sequence detection. Furthermore, the root index of each perfect subsequence is
designed to eliminate the influence of strong Doppler shift on radar sensing.
Finally, a data-embedded MS-QP (DE-MS-QP) waveform is constructed through
time-domain extension of the MS-QP sequence, generating null frequency points
on each subband for data transmission. Unlike the co-existence-based JRC system
in TDD manner, the proposed DE-MS-QP waveform enables simultaneous
interference-free sensing and communication, whilst inheriting all the merits
from MS-QP sequences. Numerical results validate the superiority of the
proposed waveforms regarding the communication and sensing performances,
hardware cost as well as flexibility of the resource allocation between the
dual functions.

are significantly affected by the gas flow and atmospheric structure around the
planet. We investigate the gas flow in the protoplanetary disk perturbed by the

calculate the orbital evolutions of particles in the gas structure obtained
from the hydrodynamic simulation. Based on the orbital calculations, we obtain
the collision rate between the planet and centimeter to kilometer sized

collide with the planet due to the atmospheric gas drag, which significantly
enhances the collision rate. On the other hand, the gas flow plays an important
role for smaller particles. Finally, considering the effects of the atmosphere
and gas flow, we derive the new analytic formula for the collision rate, which
is in good agreement with our simulations. We estimate the growth timescale and
accretion efficiency of drifting bodies for the formation of a gas-giant solid
core using the formula. We find the accretion of sub-kilometer sized bodies

ionization does not occur in destructive interference regions. Such a large
density modulation leads to efficient Thomson scattering of a second

dynamic networks, and has many important applications, including knowledge
graphs, citation networks to social networks. Graphs of this type are usually
large-scale but only a small subset of vertices are related in downstream
tasks. Current methods are too expensive to this setting as the complexity is
at best linear-dependent on both the number of nodes and edges. In this paper,
we propose a new method, namely Dynamic Personalized PageRank Embedding
(\textsc{DynamicPPE}) for learning a target subset of node representations over
large-scale dynamic networks. Based on recent advances in local node embedding
and a novel computation of dynamic personalized PageRank vector (PPV),
\textsc{DynamicPPE} has two key ingredients: 1) the per-PPV complexity is
$\mathcal{O}(m \bar{d} / \epsilon)$ where $m,\bar{d}$, and $\epsilon$ are the
number of edges received, average degree, global precision error respectively.
Thus, the per-edge event update of a single node is only dependent on $\bar{d}$
in average; and 2) by using these high quality PPVs and hash kernels, the
learned embeddings have properties of both locality and global consistency.
These two make it possible to capture the evolution of graph structure
effectively. Experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and
efficiency of the proposed method over large-scale dynamic networks. We apply
\textsc{DynamicPPE} to capture the embedding change of Chinese cities in the
Wikipedia graph during this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic

because it includes three key components: a Q-function (also called

cumulative utility for the constraint, and a virtual-Queue that
(over)-estimates the cumulative constraint violation. Under Triple-Q, at each
step, an action is chosen based on the pseudo-Q-value that is a combination of
the three ""Q"" values. The algorithm updates the reward and utility Q-values
with learning rates that depend on the visit counts to the corresponding

Triple-Q achieves $\tilde{\cal O}\left(\frac{1 }{\delta}H^4

for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation is presented. The governing
equations employ Chorin's classical artificial compressibility (AC) formulation
cast in hyperbolic form. Instead of splitting the second-order conservation law
into two equations, one for the solution and another for the gradient, the
Navier-Stokes equation is cast into a first-order hyperbolic system of
equations. Including the gradients in the AC iterative process results in a
significant improvement in accuracy for the pressure, velocity, and its
gradients. Furthermore, this treatment allows for taking larger time-steps
since the hyperbolic formulation eliminates the restriction due to diffusion.
Tests using the method of manufactured solutions show that solving the
conventional form of the Navier-Stokes equation lowers the order of accuracy
for gradients, while the hyperbolic method is shown to provide equal orders of
accuracy for both the velocity and its gradients which may be beneficial in
several applications. Two- and three-dimensional benchmark tests demonstrate
the superior accuracy and computational efficiency of the developed solver in
comparison to the conventional method and other published works. This study
shows that the developed high-order hyperbolic solver for incompressible flows
is attractive due to its accuracy, stability and efficiency in solving
diffusion dominated problems.

tasks like unsupervised syntactic parsing. Rapid progress in recent years was
arguably spurred on by the empirical success of the Parsing-Reading-Predict
architecture of (Shen et al., 2018a), later simplified by the Order Neuron LSTM

were able to successfully perform unsupervised syntactic parsing (evaluated by
various metrics like F-1 score).
  However, even heuristic (much less fully mathematical) understanding of why
and when these architectures work is lagging severely behind. In this work, we
answer representational questions raised by the architectures in (Shen et al.,
2018a, 2019), as well as some transition-based syntax-aware language models
(Dyer et al., 2016): what kind of syntactic structure can current neural
approaches to syntax represent? Concretely, we ground this question in the
sandbox of probabilistic context-free-grammars (PCFGs), and identify a key
aspect of the representational power of these approaches: the amount and
directionality of context that the predictor has access to when forced to make
parsing decision. We show that with limited context (either bounded, or
unidirectional), there are PCFGs, for which these approaches cannot represent
the max-likelihood parse; conversely, if the context is unlimited, they can
represent the max-likelihood parse of any PCFG.

how one popular abstractive model, the pointer-generator model of See et al.

abstraction (generation) vs extraction (copying). On an extractive-biased

otherwise often copied verbatim. When we modify the copy/generation switch and
force the model to generate, only simple paraphrasing abilities are revealed
alongside factual inaccuracies and hallucinations. On an abstractive-biased

abstractive summarization models lack the semantic understanding necessary to
generate paraphrases that are both abstractive and faithful to the source

problem where each user strategically chooses which machine to use. Each
machine incurs a cost, which is a function of the total load assigned to it,
and some cost-sharing mechanism distributes this cost among the machine's
users. The users choose a machine aiming to minimize their own share of the
cost, so the cost-sharing mechanism induces a game among them. We approach this
problem from the perspective of a designer who can select which cost-sharing
mechanism to use, aiming to minimize the price of anarchy (PoA) of the induced
games.
  Recent work introduced the class of \emph{resource-aware} cost-sharing
mechanisms, whose decisions can depend on the set of machines in the system,
but are oblivious to the total number of users. These mechanisms can guarantee
low PoA bounds for instances where the cost functions of the machines are all
convex or concave, but can suffer from very high PoA for cost functions that
deviate from these families.
  In this paper we show that if we enhance the class of resource-aware
mechanisms with some prior information regarding the users, then they can
achieve low PoA for a much more general family of cost functions. We first show
that, as long as the mechanism knows just two of the participating users, then
it can assign special roles to them and ensure a constant PoA. We then extend
this idea to settings where the mechanism has access to the probability with
which each user is present in the system. For all these instances, we provide a
mechanism that achieves an expected PoA that is logarithmic in the expected
number of users.

entropy production (EP) than that of the thermodynamic second law. This
stricter bound can be utilized to infer the EP and derive other trade-off
relations. Though the validity of the TUR has been verified in various
stochastic systems, its application to general Langevin dynamics has not been
successful in a unified way, especially for underdamped Langevin dynamics,
where odd parity variables in time-reversal operation such as velocity get
involved. Previous TURs for underdamped Langevin dynamics is neither
experimentally accessible nor reduced to the original form of the overdamped
Langevin dynamics in the zero-mass limit. Here, we find an operationally
accessible TUR for underdamped Langevin dynamics with an arbitrary
time-dependent protocol. We show that the original TUR is a consequence of our
underdamped TUR in the zero-mass limit. This indicates that the TUR formulation
presented here can be regarded as the universal form of the TUR for general
Langevin dynamics. The validity of our result is examined and confirmed for
three prototypical underdamped Langevin systems and their zero-mass limits;
free diffusion dynamics, charged Brownian particle in a magnetic field, and

present a new framework named Tail-to-Tail (\textbf{TtT}) non-autoregressive
sequence prediction to address the deep issues hidden in CGEC. Considering that
most tokens are correct and can be conveyed directly from source to target, and
the error positions can be estimated and corrected based on the bidirectional
context information, thus we employ a BERT-initialized Transformer Encoder as
the backbone model to conduct information modeling and conveying. Considering
that only relying on the same position substitution cannot handle the
variable-length correction cases, various operations such substitution,
deletion, insertion, and local paraphrasing are required jointly. Therefore, a
Conditional Random Fields (CRF) layer is stacked on the up tail to conduct
non-autoregressive sequence prediction by modeling the token dependencies.
Since most tokens are correct and easily to be predicted/conveyed to the
target, then the models may suffer from a severe class imbalance issue. To
alleviate this problem, focal loss penalty strategies are integrated into the
loss functions. Moreover, besides the typical fix-length error correction
datasets, we also construct a variable-length corpus to conduct experiments.
Experimental results on standard datasets, especially on the variable-length
datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of TtT in terms of sentence-level
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Measure on tasks of error Detection and

first-order dipolar interactions. For ground state molecules polarized by a
static electric field, the dynamics are accurately described by first-order
dipolar interactions. For microwave dressing, instead, resonant dipolar
collisions dominate the collision process, in which molecules reorient along
the intermolecular axis and interact with the full strength of the transition
dipole. For red detuning, reorientation can only be suppressed at extreme Rabi
frequencies. For blue detuned microwaves, resonant dipolar interactions
dominate even for high Rabi frequencies, leading to microwave shielding for
circular polarization and structured losses due to resonances for linear

Operations Team (SOT) is structured independently from the instrument teams and
the Mission Operations Team. The responsibilities of the SOT are divided into
four categories: 1) guest observer program and data distributions, 2)
distribution of analysis software and the calibration database, 3) guest
observer support activities, and 4) performance verification and optimization
activities. As the first step, lessons on the science operations learned from

operations from the ground stage, b) construction of an independent team for
science operations separate from the instrument development, and c) operations
with well-defined duties by appointed members are recognized as key lessons.
Then, the team structure and the task division between the mission and science
operations are defined; the tasks are shared among Japan, US, and Europe and
are performed by three centers, the SOC, SDC, and ESAC, respectively. The SOC
is designed to perform tasks close to the spacecraft operations, such as
spacecraft planning, quick-look health checks, pre-pipeline processing, etc.,

Adler function and the scalar correlator are investigated, and models for Borel
transforms of their perturbative series are constructed, which respect general
constraints from the operator product expansion and the renormalisation group.
As a novel ingredient, the QCD coupling is employed in the so-called
$C$-scheme, which has certain advantages. For the Adler function, previous
results obtained directly in the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme are supported.
Corresponding results for the scalar correlation function are new. It turns out
that the substantially larger perturbative corrections for the scalar
correlator in $\overline{\rm MS}$ are dominantly due to this scheme choice, and
can be largely reduced through more appropriate renormalisation schemes, which
are easy to realise in the $C$-scheme.

most successful methods in quantum many-body theory. A particular strength of
this method is its straightforward access to imaginary-time correlation
functions (ITCF). For example, the well-known density-density ITCF
$F(\mathbf{q},\tau)$ allows one to estimate the linear response of a given
system for all wave vectors $\mathbf{q}$ from a single simulation of the
unperturbed system. Moreover, it constitutes the basis for the reconstruction
of the dynamic structure factor $S(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ -- a key quantity in
state-of-the-art scattering experiments. In this work, we present analogous
relations between the nonlinear density response in quadratic and cubic order
of the perturbation strength and generalized ITCFs measuring correlations
between up to four imaginary-time arguments. As a practical demonstration of
our new approach, we carry out simulations of the warm dense electron gas and

substantially larger computational effort. In addition, we give a relation
between a cubic ITCF and the triple dynamic structure factor
$S(\mathbf{q}_1,\omega_1;\mathbf{q}_2,\omega_2)$, which evokes the enticing

number of breakthroughs. The most recent AMS-02 result is the measurement of
the spectrum of CR fluorine up to $\sim$2 TV. Given its very low solar system
abundance, fluorine in CRs is thought to be mostly secondary, produced in
fragmentations of heavier species, predominantly Ne, Mg, and Si. Similar to the
best-measured secondary-to-primary boron to carbon nuclei ratio that is widely
used to study the origin and propagation of CR species, the precise fluorine
data would allow the origin of Si-group nuclei to be studied independently.
Meanwhile, the secondary origin of CR fluorine has never been tested in a wide
energy range due to the lack of accurate CR data. In this paper, we use the
first ever precise measurements of the fluorine spectrum by AMS-02 together
with ACE-CRIS and Voyager 1 data to actually test this paradigm. Our detailed

a primary fluorine component. We also provide an updated local interstellar

information literacy with ideas to provide more digestible explanations of
abstract concepts through interface design. In particular, we focus on social
media platforms where we see the possibility of counteracting the spread of
misinformation by providing users with more proficiency through our approaches.
We argue that the omnipresent trend to abstract away and hide information from
users via UI/UX design opposes their ability to self-learn. This leads us to
propose a different framework in which we unify elegant and simple interfaces
with nudges that promote a look behind the curtain. Such designs serve to
foster a deeper understanding of employed technologies and aim to increase the
critical assessment of content encountered on social platforms. Furthermore, we
consider users with an intermediary skill level to be largely ignored in
current approaches, as they are given no tools to broaden their knowledge
without consultation of expert material. The resulting stagnation is
exemplified by the tactics of misinformation campaigns, which exploit the
ensuing lack of information literacy and critical thinking. We propose an
approach to design that sufficiently emancipates users in both aspects by
promoting a look behind the abstraction of UI/UX so that an autonomous learning
process is given the chance to occur. Furthermore, we name ideas for future
research within this area that take our considerations into account.

We generalize this approach to any class of algebras for an endofunctor

strategies for the task of automatic scoring of children's ability to
understand others' thoughts, feelings, and desires (or ""mindreading"").
  We recruit in-domain experts to re-annotate augmented samples and determine
to what extent each strategy preserves the original rating. We also carry out
multiple experiments to measure how much each augmentation strategy improves
the performance of automatic scoring systems. To determine the capabilities of
automatic systems to generalize to unseen data, we create UK-MIND-20 - a new
corpus of children's performance on tests of mindreading, consisting of 10,320
question-answer pairs.
  We obtain a new state-of-the-art performance on the MIND-CA corpus, improving
macro-F1-score by 6 points. Results indicate that both the number of training
examples and the quality of the augmentation strategies affect the performance
of the systems. The task-specific augmentations generally outperform
task-agnostic augmentations. Automatic augmentations based on vectors (GloVe,
FastText) perform the worst.
  We find that systems trained on MIND-CA generalize well to UK-MIND-20. We
demonstrate that data augmentation strategies also improve the performance on
unseen data.

labels $\hat{x}_i$ are used to infer unknown labels, assuming that the label
signal $\mathbf{x}$ is smooth with respect to a similarity graph specified by a
Laplacian matrix. When restricting labels $x_i$ to binary values, the problem
is NP-hard. While a conventional semi-definite programming relaxation (SDR) can
be solved in polynomial time using, for example, the alternating direction
method of multipliers (ADMM), the complexity of projecting a candidate matrix
$\mathbf{M}$ onto the positive semi-definite (PSD) cone ($\mathbf{M} \succeq
0$) per iteration remains high. In this paper, leveraging a recent linear
algebraic theory called Gershgorin disc perfect alignment (GDPA), we propose a
fast projection-free method by solving a sequence of linear programs (LP)
instead. Specifically, we first recast the SDR to its dual, where a feasible
solution $\mathbf{H} \succeq 0$ is interpreted as a Laplacian matrix
corresponding to a balanced signed graph minus the last node. To achieve graph
balance, we split the last node into two, each retains the original positive /
negative edges, resulting in a new Laplacian $\bar{\mathbf{H}}$. We repose the
SDR dual for solution $\bar{\mathbf{H}}$, then replace the PSD cone constraint
$\bar{\mathbf{H}} \succeq 0$ with linear constraints derived from GDPA --
sufficient conditions to ensure $\bar{\mathbf{H}}$ is PSD -- so that the
optimization becomes an LP per iteration. Finally, we extract predicted labels
from converged solution $\bar{\mathbf{H}}$. Experiments show that our algorithm
enjoyed a $28\times$ speedup over the next fastest scheme while achieving

coalescing droplets have a negligible effect on the drag, whereas the
non-coalescing ones steadily increase drag as the volume fraction of the
dispersed phase increases: indeed, at 10\% volume fraction, the non-coalescing
droplets show a 30\% increase in drag, whereas the coalescing droplets show
less than 4\% increase. We explain this by looking at the wall-normal location
of droplets in the channel and show that non-coalescing droplets enter the
viscous sublayer, generating an interfacial shear stress which reduces the
budget for viscous stress in the channel. On the other hand, coalescing
droplets migrate towards the bulk of the channel forming large aggregates,
which hardly affect the viscous shear stress while damping the Reynolds shear
stress. We prove this by relating the mean viscous shear stress integrated in

details of the activity, we have undertaken a kinematic analysis of the ALMA
archive data of $^{12}$CO($J$=3-2) emission at the highest resolution $\sim$3
pc. We revealed that one of the non-rotating gas components in the central

loop-like structure is associated with a star cluster, whereas the cluster is
not inside the loop-like structure and is not likely as the driver of the
loop-like structure formation. Further, we find that the bar potential of NGC
253 seems to be too weak to drive the gas motion by the eccentric orbit. As an
alternative, we frame a scenario that magnetic acceleration by the Parker
instability is responsible for the creation of the loop-like structure. We show
that the observed loop-like structure properties are similar to those in the
Milky Way, and argue that recent magneto-hydrodynamics simulations lend support
for the picture having the magnetic field strength of $\gtrsim$100 $\mu$G. We
suggest that cluster formation was triggered by the falling gas to the
footpoint of the loop, which is consistent with a typical dynamical timescale
of the loop $\sim$1 Myr.

  Representation Learning on External Causal Statement","Accepted to Findings of ACL 2021",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Current models for event causality identification (ECI) mainly adopt a
supervised framework, which heavily rely on labeled data for training.
Unfortunately, the scale of current annotated datasets is relatively limited,
which cannot provide sufficient support for models to capture useful indicators
from causal statements, especially for handing those new, unseen cases. To
alleviate this problem, we propose a novel approach, shortly named CauSeRL,
which leverages external causal statements for event causality identification.
First of all, we design a self-supervised framework to learn context-specific
causal patterns from external causal statements. Then, we adopt a contrastive
transfer strategy to incorporate the learned context-specific causal patterns
into the target ECI model. Experimental results show that our method
significantly outperforms previous methods on EventStoryLine and
Causal-TimeBank (+2.0 and +3.4 points on F1 value respectively).

for one variant is often ineffective for or not even applicable to another,
which has prevented practical applications. In this paper, we give a general
representation of UDA problems, named Generalized Domain Adaptation (GDA). GDA
covers the major variants as special cases, which allows us to organize them in
a comprehensive framework. Moreover, this generalization leads to a new
challenging setting where existing methods fail, such as when domain labels are
unknown, and class labels are only partially given to each domain. We propose a
novel approach to the new setting. The key to our approach is self-supervised
class-destructive learning, which enables the learning of class-invariant
representations and domain-adversarial classifiers without using any domain
labels. Extensive experiments using three benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our method outperforms the state-of-the-art UDA methods in the new setting and
that it is competitive in existing UDA variations as well.

state-of-the-art quantum devices still contain only a very limited number of
qubits. One possible way to execute more realistic algorithms in near-term
quantum devices is to employ dynamic quantum circuits, in which measurements
can happen during the circuit and their outcomes are used to control other
parts of the circuit. This technique can help to significantly reduce the
resources required to achieve a given accuracy of a quantum algorithm. However,
since this type of quantum circuits are more flexible, their verification is
much more challenging. In this paper, we give a formal definition of dynamic
quantum circuits and then propose to characterise their functionality in terms
of ensembles of linear operators. Based on this novel semantics, two dynamic
quantum circuits are equivalent if they have the same functionality. We further
propose and implement two decision diagram-based algorithms for checking the
equivalence of dynamic quantum circuits. Experiments show that embedding
classical logic into conventional quantum circuits does not incur significant

of recommendation chatbots has primarily been taking an information-centric
approach by focusing on the recommended content per se. Limited attention is on
how social connection and relational strategies, such as self-disclosure from a
chatbot, may influence users' perception and acceptance of the recommendation.
In this work, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a social chatbot capable
of performing three different levels of self-disclosure: factual information
(low), cognitive opinions (medium), and emotions (high). In the evaluation, we
recruited 372 participants to converse with the chatbot on two topics: movies
and COVID-19 experiences. In each topic, the chatbot performed small talks and
made recommendations relevant to the topic. Participants were randomly assigned
to four experimental conditions where the chatbot used factual, cognitive,
emotional, and adaptive strategies to perform self-disclosures. By training a
text classifier to identify users' level of self-disclosure in real-time, the
adaptive chatbot can dynamically match its self-disclosure to the level of
disclosure exhibited by the users. Our results show that users reciprocate with
higher-level self-disclosure when a recommendation chatbot consistently
displays emotions throughout the conversation. Chatbot's emotional disclosure
also led to increased interactional enjoyment and more positive interpersonal
perception towards the bot, fostering a stronger human-chatbot relationship and
thus leading to increased recommendation effectiveness, including a higher
tendency to accept the recommendation. We discuss the understandings obtained
and implications to future design.

for the exploration of the Earth's subsurface. However, the interpretation of
inverted images can sometimes be difficult, due to the inherent limitations of
existing inversion algorithms, which produce smoothed sections. In order to
improve and automate the processing and interpretation of inverted geophysical
models, we propose an approach inspired from data mining. We selected an
algorithm known as DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications
with Noise) to perform clustering of inverted geophysical sections. The
methodology relies on the automatic sorting and clustering of data. DBSCAN
detects clusters in the inverted electrical resistivity values, with no prior
knowledge of the number of clusters. This algorithm has the advantage of being
defined by only two parameters: the neighbourhood of a point in the data space,
and the minimum number of data points in this neighbourhood. We propose an
objective procedure for the determination of these two parameters. The proof of
concept described here is applied to simulated ERT (electrical resistivity
tomography) sections, for the following three cases: two layers with a step,
two layers with a rebound, and two layers with an anomaly embedded in the upper
layer. To validate this approach, sensitivity studies were carried out on both
of the above parameters, as well as to assess the influence of noise on the
algorithm's performance. Finally, this methodology was tested on real field
data. DBSCAN detects clusters in the inverted electrical resistivity models,
and the former are then associated with various types of earth materials, thus
allowing the structure of the prospected area to be determined. The proposed
data-mining algorithm is shown to be effective, and to improve the
interpretation of the inverted ERT sections. This new approach has considerable
potential, as it can be applied to any geophysical data represented in the form
of sections or maps.

and most of the existing methods achieve this by aggregation. However, relying
only on aggregation to propagate information in dynamic graphs can result in
delays in information propagation and thus affect the performance of the
method. To alleviate this problem, we propose an aggregation-diffusion (AD)
mechanism that actively propagates information to its neighbor by diffusion
after the node updates its embedding through the aggregation mechanism. In

existing GBM-based solutions: they either require training multiple models or
they become too computationally expensive to be useful for large-scale
settings. We propose Probabilistic Gradient Boosting Machines (PGBM), a method
to create probabilistic predictions with a single ensemble of decision trees in
a computationally efficient manner. PGBM approximates the leaf weights in a
decision tree as a random variable, and approximates the mean and variance of
each sample in a dataset via stochastic tree ensemble update equations. These
learned moments allow us to subsequently sample from a specified distribution
after training. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of PGBM compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods: (i) PGBM enables probabilistic estimates
without compromising on point performance in a single model, (ii) PGBM learns
probabilistic estimates via a single model only (and without requiring
multi-parameter boosting), and thereby offers a speedup of up to several orders
of magnitude over existing state-of-the-art methods on large datasets, and
(iii) PGBM achieves accurate probabilistic estimates in tasks with complex
differentiable loss functions, such as hierarchical time series problems, where
we observed up to 10% improvement in point forecasting performance and up to

contains complex mutual interactions between the neurons under different
conditions, which depend on the internal state of the network. The internal
state can be defined as the distribution of activity across all individual
neurons across the network. Therefore, the state of a neuron/network becomes a
defining factor for how information is represented within the network. Towards
this study, we constructed a fully connected (with dense/sparse coding
strategies) recurrent network comprising of both excitatory and inhibitory
neurons, driven by pseudo-random inputs of varying frequencies. In this study
we assessed the impact of varying specific intrinsic parameters of the neurons
that enriched network state dynamics, such as initial neuron activity, amount
of inhibition in combination with thresholded neurons and conduction delays.
The impact was assessed by quantifying the changes in mutual interactions
between the neurons within the network for each given input. We found such
effects were more profound in sparsely connected networks than in densely
connected networks. However, also densely connected networks could make use of
such dynamic changes in the mutual interactions between neurons, as a given

enables the fast retrieval of X-ray upper limits and photometry products in
three energy bands (0.2-2, 2-12, 0.2-12 keV) for large numbers of input sky
positions. This is accomplished using the Hierarchical Equal Area Iso Latitude

commitment (how the organizer and attendees participate in AC), environment
(how conducive and comfortable AC is conducted), content (the discussed topics

AC). We also present the format of our AC, an elective class which was

evaluation with the attendees showed that enrollees (those who are enrolled and

attending compared to audiences (those who are not enrolled and are not

papers outside their research field harder to read. Finally, we showed an
improvement in the weekly number of papers read after attending AC of those who
present papers regularly, and a high satisfaction rating of our AC. We
summarize the areas of improvement in our AC implementation, and we encourage
other institutions to evaluate their own AC in accordance with the four
aforementioned factors to assess the effectiveness of their AC in reaching
their goals.

requires extreme conditions of either ultra-high energies for the electrons

to attributing synthetic text generated by a handful (usually < 10) of

filter lock-protected regions and performs AST-level code transformation of the
surrounding locks when profitable. Profitability is driven by both static
analyses of critical sections and dynamic analysis via execution profiles. A
custom HTM library, using perceptron, learns concurrency behavior and
dynamically decides whether to use HTM in the rewritten lock/unlock points.

surrogates include Gaussian process models which have been adopted in many
contributions, the most popular ones being the efficient global reliability
analysis (EGRA) and the active Kriging Monte Carlo simulation (AK-MCS), two
milestone contributions in the field. In this paper, we first conduct a survey
of the recent literature, showing that most of the proposed methods actually
span from modifying one or more aspects of the two aforementioned methods. We
then propose a generalized modular framework to build on-the-fly efficient
active learning strategies by combining the following four ingredients or
modules: surrogate model, reliability estimation algorithm, learning function
and stopping criterion. Using this framework, we devise 39 strategies for the
solution of $20$ reliability benchmark problems. The results of this extensive
benchmark (more than $12,000$ reliability problems solved) are analyzed under
various criteria leading to a synthesized set of recommendations for
practitioners. These may be refined with a priori knowledge about the feature
of the problem to solve, i.e. dimensionality and magnitude of the failure
probability. This benchmark has eventually highlighted the importance of using
surrogates in conjunction with sophisticated reliability estimation algorithms
as a way to enhance the efficiency of the latter.

of a deep neural network (DNN) often demonstrates double descent: as the model
complexity increases, it first follows a classical U-shaped curve and then
shows a second descent. Through bias-variance decomposition, recent studies
revealed that the bell-shaped variance is the major cause of model-wise double
descent (when the DNN is widened gradually). This paper investigates epoch-wise
double descent, i.e., the test error of a DNN also shows double descent as the
number of training epoches increases. By extending the bias-variance analysis
to epoch-wise double descent of the zero-one loss, we surprisingly find that
the variance itself, without the bias, varies consistently with the test error.
Inspired by this result, we propose a novel metric, optimization variance (OV),
to measure the diversity of model updates caused by the stochastic gradients of
random training batches drawn in the same iteration. OV can be estimated using
samples from the training set only but correlates well with the (unknown)
\emph{test} error, and hence early stopping may be achieved without using a
validation set.

big data sets that present opportunities to conduct new analyses for improved
understanding of water quality dynamics and more effective management of rivers
and streams. Of primary importance is enhancing knowledge of the relationships
between nitrate, one of the most reactive forms of inorganic nitrogen in the
aquatic environment, and other water quality variables. We analysed high
frequency water quality data from in situ sensors deployed in three sites from
different watersheds and climate zones within the National Ecological
Observatory Network, USA. We used generalised additive mixed models to explain
the nonlinear relationships at each site between nitrate concentration and
conductivity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, water temperature, and elevation.
Temporal auto correlation was modelled with an auto regressive moving average
model and we examined the relative importance of the explanatory variables.
Total deviance explained by the models was high for all sites. Although
variable importance and the smooth regression parameters differed among sites,
the models explaining the most variation in nitrate contained the same
explanatory variables. This study demonstrates that building a model for
nitrate using the same set of explanatory water quality variables is
achievable, even for sites with vastly different environmental and climatic
characteristics. Applying such models will assist managers to select cost
effective water quality variables to monitor when the goals are to gain a
spatially and temporally in depth understanding of nitrate dynamics and adapt
management plans accordingly.

environments, such as airports, shopping malls, etc. However, due to sparse

challenge. Furthermore, it is unreliable for the robot to navigate safely in
crowds while considering human comfort. Thus, how to navigate safely with
localization precision in that environment is a critical problem. To solve this

path with the consideration of human comfort and crowds, localization
uncertainty, and the cost-to-go to the target. Three parts are involved in the
proposed framework: the distance assessment module, the Curiosity for Positive

localization uncertainty evaluation is not satisfied. This factor is predicted
through the propagation of uncertainty along the candidate trajectory to
provoke the robot to approach localization-referenced landmarks. The Human
Comfort and Crowd Density Map (HCCDM) based on the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
is established to calculate CNC, which drives the robot to bypass the crowd and
consider human comfort. The evaluation is conducted in a series of large-scale

  Integration",,,"10.1109/TIE.2022.3232655",,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Solar micro-inverters are becoming increasingly popular as they are modular,
and they posses the capability of extracting maximum available power from the
individual photovoltaic (PV) modules of a solar array. For realizing
micro-inverters single stage transformer-less topologies are preferred as they
offer better power evacuation efficacy. A SEPIC-\'Cuk based transformer-less
micro-inverter, having only one high frequency switch and four line frequency
switches, is proposed in this paper. The proposed converter can be employed to
interface a 35 V PV module to a 220 V single phase ac grid. As a very high gain
is required to be achieved for the converter, it is made to operate in
discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) for all possible operating conditions.
Since the ground of the each PV modules is connected to the ground of the
utility, there is no possibility of leakage current flow between the module and
the utility. Detailed simulation studies are carried out to ascertain the
efficacy of the proposed micro-inverter. A laboratory prototype of the inverter
is fabricated, and detailed experimental studies are carried out to confirm the
viability of the proposed scheme.

reducibility, which commonly appears in reverse constructive mathematics. The
notion can be generally used to compare and classify various principles studied
in reverse constructive mathematics (formal Church's thesis, Brouwer's
Continuity principle and Fan theorem, Excluded middle, Limited principle,
Function choice, Markov's principle, etc.). We show that the instance degrees
form a frame, i.e., a complete lattice in which finite infima distribute over
set-indexed suprema. They turn out to be equivalent to the frame of upper sets
of truth values, ordered by the reverse Smyth partial order. We study the
overall structure of the lattice: the subobject classifier embeds into the
lattice in two different ways, one monotone and the other antimonotone, and the
$\lnot\lnot$-dense degrees coincide with those that are reducible to the degree
of Excluded middle.
  We give an explicit formulation of instance degrees in a relative
realizability topos, and call these extended Weihrauch degrees, because in
Kleene-Vesley realizability the $\lnot\lnot$-dense modest instance degrees
correspond precisely to Weihrauch degrees. The extended degrees improve the
structure of Weihrauch degrees by equipping them with computable infima and
suprema, an implication, the ability to control access to parameters and
computation of results, and by generally widening the scope of Weihrauch
reducibility.

vascular damage and is one of the leading causes of vision impairment and

where there are almost no symptoms, except a few microaneurysms, and
proliferative (PDR) involving a huge number of microaneurysms and hemorrhages,
soft and hard exudates, neo-vascularization, macular ischemia or a combination
of these, making it easier to detect. More specifically, DR is usually
classified into five levels, labeled 0-4, from 0 indicating no DR to 4 which is
most severe. This paper firstly presents a discussion on the risk factors of
the disease, then surveys the recent literature on the topic followed by
examining certain techniques which were found to be highly effective in
improving the prognosis accuracy. Finally, a convolutional neural network model
is proposed to detect all the stages of DR on a low-memory edge
microcontroller. The model has a size of just 5.9 MB, accuracy and F1 score

lifelong learning, many tasks are presented in sequence and learners must
efficiently transfer knowledge between tasks while avoiding catastrophic
forgetting over long lifetimes. On these problems, policy reuse and other
multi-policy reinforcement learning techniques can learn many tasks. However,
they can generate many temporary or permanent policies, resulting in memory
issues. Consequently, there is a need for lifetime-scalable methods that
continually refine a policy library of a pre-defined size. This paper presents
a first approach to lifetime-scalable policy reuse. To pre-select the number of
policies, a notion of task capacity, the maximal number of tasks that a policy
can accurately solve, is proposed. To evaluate lifetime policy reuse using this
method, two state-of-the-art single-actor base-learners are compared: 1) a
value-based reinforcement learner, Deep Q-Network (DQN) or Deep Recurrent
Q-Network (DRQN); and 2) an actor-critic reinforcement learner, Proximal Policy
Optimisation (PPO) with or without Long Short-Term Memory layer. By selecting
the number of policies based on task capacity, D(R)QN achieves near-optimal
performance with 6 policies in a 27-task MDP domain and 9 policies in an
18-task POMDP domain; with fewer policies, catastrophic forgetting and negative
transfer are observed. Due to slow, monotonic improvement, PPO requires fewer
policies, 1 policy for the 27-task domain and 4 policies for the 18-task
domain, but it learns the tasks with lower accuracy than D(R)QN. These findings
validate lifetime-scalable policy reuse and suggest using D(R)QN for larger and
PPO for smaller library sizes.

The most convincing way to demonstrate this is done via Fourier-Hankel
decomposition (FHD), where the local oscillation field is separated into in-
and outgoing waves, showing the reduction in power. Due to the Helioseismic and
Magnetic Imager's high-cadence Doppler measurements, power absorption can be
investigated at frequencies beyond the acoustic cutoff frequency. We perform an
FHD on five sunspot regions and two quiet-Sun control regions and study the
resulting absorption spectra $\alpha_\ell(\nu)$, specifically at frequencies
$\nu$ > 5.3 mHz. We observe an unreported high-frequency absorption feature,
which only appears in the presence of a sunspot. This feature is confined to
phase speeds of one-skip waves whose origins coincide with the sunspot's
center, with $v_{ph}$ = 85.7 km/s in this case. By employing a fit to the
absorption spectra at a constant phase speed, we find that the peak absorption
strength $\alpha_{max}$ lies between 0.166 and 0.222 at a noise level of about
0.009 (5%). The well-known absorption along ridges at lower frequencies can
reach up to $\alpha_{max}\approx$ 0.5. Thus our finding in the absorption
spectrum is weaker, but nevertheless significant. From first considerations
regarding the energy budget of high-frequency waves, this observation can
likely be explained by the reduction of emissivity within the sunspot. We
derive a simple relation between emissivity and absorption. We conclude that
sunspots yield a wave power absorption signature (for certain phase speeds
only), which may help in understanding the effect of strong magnetic fields on
convection and source excitation and potentially in understanding the general
sunspot subsurface structure.

of single molecules in cellular environments is an important problem in
fluorescence microscopy. We consider the fundamental data model, where
molecules emit photons at random times and the photons arrive at random
locations on the detector according to complex point spread functions (PSFs).
The random, non-Gaussian PSF of the detection process and random trajectory of
the molecule make inference challenging. Moreover, the presence of other nearby
molecules causes further uncertainty in the origin of the measurements, which
impacts the statistical precision of estimates. We quantify the limits of
accuracy of model parameter estimates and separation distance between closely
spaced molecules (known as the resolution problem) by computing the Cramer-Rao
lower bound (CRLB), or equivalently the inverse of the Fisher information
matrix (FIM), for the variance of estimates. This fundamental CRLB is crucial,
as it provides a lower bound for more practical scenarios. While analytic
expressions for the FIM can be derived for static molecules, the analytical
tools to evaluate it for molecules whose trajectories follow SDEs are still
mostly missing. We address this by presenting a general SMC based methodology
for both parameter inference and computing the desired accuracy limits for
non-static molecules and a non-Gaussian fundamental detection model. For the
first time, we are able to estimate the FIM for stochastically moving molecules
observed through the Airy and Born & Wolf PSF. This is achieved by estimating
the score and observed information matrix via SMC. We sum up the outcome of our
numerical work by summarising the qualitative behaviours for the accuracy
limits as functions of e.g. collected photon count, molecule diffusion, etc. We
also verify that we can recover known results from the static molecule case.

poorly at learning from a handful of examples, large pretrained language models
have recently been shown to be efficient few-shot learners. One approach to
few-shot learning, which does not require finetuning of model parameters, is to
augment the language model's input with priming text which is typically
constructed using task specific descriptions and examples. In this work, we
further explore priming-based few-shot learning, with focus on using examples
as prompts. We show that presenting examples in the right order is key for
generalization. We introduce PERO (Prompting with Examples in the Right Order),
where we formulate few-shot learning as search over the set of permutations of
the training examples. We show that PERO can learn to generalize efficiently
using as few as 10 examples, in contrast to existing approaches. While the
newline token is a natural choice for separating the examples in the prompt, we
show that learning a new separator token can potentially provide further gains
in performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on the
tasks of sentiment classification, natural language inference and fact
retrieval. Finally, we analyze the learned prompts to reveal novel insights,
including the idea that two training examples in the right order alone can
provide competitive performance for sentiment classification and natural
language inference.

with the blue and red Gaia slit-less spectrophotometers. The main challenge
when facing Gaia spectral calibration is that no lamp spectra or flat fields
are available during the mission. Also, the significant size of the line spread
function with respect to the dispersion of the prisms produces alien photons
contaminating neighbouring positions of the spectra. This makes the calibration
special and different from standard approaches.
  This work gives a detailed description of the internal calibration model to
obtain the spectrophotometric data in the Gaia catalogue. The main purpose of
the internal calibration is to bring all the epoch spectra onto a common flux
and pixel (pseudo-wavelength) scale, taking into account variations over the
focal plane and with time, producing a mean spectrum from all the observations
of the same source.
  In order to describe all observations in a common mean flux and
pseudo-wavelength scale, we construct a suitable representation of the
internally calibrated mean spectra via basis functions and we describe the
transformation between non calibrated epoch spectra and calibrated mean spectra
via a discrete convolution, parametrising the convolution kernel to recover the
relevant coefficients.
  The model proposed here is able to combine all observations into a mean
instrument to allow the comparison of different sources and observations
obtained with different instrumental conditions along the mission and the
generation of mean spectra from a number of observations of the same source.
The output of this model provides the internal mean spectra, not as a sampled
function (flux and wavelength), but as a linear combination of basis functions,
although sampled spectra can easily be derived from them.

circumbinary orbits. Whether the planet can be habitable or not depends on the
possibility to maintain liquid water on its surface, and therefore on the
luminosity of its host stars and on the dynamical properties of the planetary
orbit. The trajectory of a planet in a double star system can be determined,
approximating stars and planets with point masses, by solving numerically the
equations of motion of the classical three-body system. In this study, we
analyze a large data set of planetary orbits, made up with high precision long
integration at varying: the mass of the planet, its distance from the primary
star, the mass ratio for the two stars in the binary system, and the
eccentricity of the star motion. To simulate the gravitational dynamics, we use
a 15th order integration scheme (IAS15, available within the REBOUND
framework), that provides an optimal solution for long-term integration. In our
data analysis, we evaluate if an orbit is stable or not and also provide the
statistics of different types of instability: collisions with the primary or
secondary star and planets ejected away from the binary star system. Concerning
the stability, we find a significant number of orbits that are only marginally
stable, according to the classification introduced by Musielak et al. 2005. For
planets of negligible mass, we estimate the critical semi-major axis $a_c$ as a
function of the mass ratio and the eccentricity of the binary, in agreement
with the results of Holman and Wiegert 1999. However, we find that for very
massive planets (Super-Jupiters) the critical semi-major axis decrease in some
cases by a few percent, compared to cases in which the mass of the planet is
negligible.

the sympathetic and parasympathetic activity contributes significantly to the

many vital processes during fetal, perinatal and postnatal life: from the
regulation of inflammation through the anti-inflammatory cholinergic pathway,
which may affect the functioning of each organ, to the production of hormones
involved in bioenergetic metabolism. In addition, the vagus nerve has been
recognized as the primary afferent pathway capable of transmitting information
to the brain from every organ of the body. Therefore, this hypothesis paper
aims to review the development of ANS during fetal and perinatal life, focusing
particularly on the vagus nerve, to identify possible ""critical windows"" that
could impact its maturation. These ""critical windows"" could help clinicians
know when to monitor fetuses to effectively assess the developmental status of
both ANS and specifically the vagus nerve. In addition, this paper will focus
on which factors (i.e. fetal characteristics and behaviors, maternal lifestyle
and pathologies, placental health and dysfunction, labor, incubator conditions,

the above-mentioned ""critical window"" and how. This analysis could help
clinicians and stakeholders define precise guidelines for improving the

adverse environmental impacts on ANS development that may lead to persistent
long-term consequences. Since the development of ANS and the vagus influence
have been shown to be reflected in cardiac variability, this paper will rely in

metric potentials remain the same in GR and in f(R,T) gravity. Consequently,
the geometrical behavior of the $f(R,T)$ gravity models remains the same as the

the behavior of effective matter which acts as a stiff fluid in all models. The
individual fluids have very rich behavior. In one of the viscous models, the
matter either follows a semi-realistic EoS or exhibits a transition from stiff
matter to phantom, depending on the values of the parameter. In another model,
the matter describes radiation, dust, quintessence, phantom, and the

Dynamic facilitation generically accelerates the relaxation of the deepest

Each optimization pass is typically composed of multiple alternating phases of

Consequently, the downstream transformations may be considered unsafe until the

compiler frameworks do not perform automated stabilization of the
program-abstractions and instead leave it to the optimization writer to deal

(AM) flux recorded by the Solar Orbiter spacecraft. Our aim is the validation
of these measurements to support future studies of the Sun's AM loss. Methods:
We combine 60-minute averages of the proton bulk moments and the magnetic field
measured by the Solar Wind Analyser (SWA) and the magnetometer (MAG) onboard
Solar Orbiter. We calculate the AM flux per solid-angle element using data from
the first orbit of the mission's cruise phase during 2020. We separate the
contributions from protons and from magnetic stresses to the total AM flux.
Results: The AM flux varies significantly over time. The particle contribution
typically dominates over the magnetic-field contribution during our measurement
interval. The total AM flux shows the largest variation and is typically
anti-correlated with the radial solar-wind speed. We identify a compression
region, potentially associated with a co-rotating interaction region or a
coronal mass ejection, that leads to a significant localised increase in the AM
flux, yet without a significant increase in the AM per unit mass. We repeat our
analysis using the density estimate from the Radio and Plasma Waves (RPW)
instrument. Using this independent method, we find a decrease in the peaks of
positive AM flux but otherwise consistent results. Conclusions: Our results
largely agree with previous measurements of the solar-wind AM flux in terms of
amplitude, variability, and dependence on radial solar-wind bulk speed. Our
analysis highlights the potential for future, more detailed, studies of the
solar wind's AM and its other large-scale properties with data from Solar
Orbiter. We emphasise the need to study the radial evolution and latitudinal
dependence of the AM flux in combination with data from Parker Solar Probe and
assets at heliocentric distances of 1 au and beyond.

controversies about the harms of digital technology, discourses and practices
of ""tech ethics"" have proliferated across the tech industry, academia, civil
society, and government. Yet despite the seeming promise of ethics, tech ethics
in practice suffers from several significant limitations: tech ethics is vague
and toothless, has a myopic focus on individual engineers and technology
design, and is subsumed into corporate logics and incentives. These limitations
suggest that tech ethics enables corporate ""ethics-washing"": embracing the
language of ethics to defuse criticism and resist government regulation,
without committing to ethical behavior. Given these dynamics, I describe tech
ethics as a terrain of contestation where the central debate is not whether
ethics is desirable, but what ""ethics"" entails and who gets to define it.
Current approaches to tech ethics are poised to enable technologists and
technology companies to label themselves as ""ethical"" without substantively
altering their practices. Thus, those striving for structural improvements in
digital technologies must be mindful of the gap between ethics as a mode of
normative inquiry and ethics as a practical endeavor. In order to better
evaluate the opportunities and limits of tech ethics, I propose a
sociotechnical approach that analyzes tech ethics in light of who defines it
and what impacts it generates in practice.

K and field $B$ in the ab-plane, we obtain contrasting NL responses in low ($<$
2 ${T}$) and high field regions. For low fields the NL behavior is dominated by
a quadratic response (positive $\chi_2$), which shows a rapid rise below $T_c$.
This large $\chi_2 >0$ implies a broken sublattice symmetry of magnetic order
at low temperatures. Classical Monte Carlo (CMC) simulations in the standard
${K-H-\Gamma}$ model secure such a quadratic ${B}$ dependence of ${M}$, only

high field NL behavior well. ${\chi}_3$ is large and positive both below and
above ${T}_c$ crossing zero only for ${T}$ $>$ 50 K. In contrast, for

defensive actions based on what they prevented from happening in the game. Our

galactic nuclei (AGNs) to investigate the variation of the magnetic field along
with the jet from the sub-pc base to the terminus in kpc-to-Mpc scales.
Expanding the number of radio/X-ray samples in Kataoka & Stawarz (2005), we
analyzed the data in 12 FR I and 30 FR II radio galaxies, 12 quasars, and 3 BL
Lacs that contained 76 knots, 42 hotspots, and 29 radio lobes. We first derived
the equipartition magnetic fields in the cores and then estimated those in
various jet components by assuming $B_{\rm est}$ $\propto$ $d^{-1}$, where $d$
is the distance from the jet base. On the other hand, the magnetic field in
large-scale jets (knots, hotspots, and lobes), $B_{\rm eq}$, can be estimated
from the observed flux and spatial extent under the equipartition hypothesis.
We show that the magnetic field decreases as the distance along the jet
increases, but generally gentler than $\propto d^{-1}$. The increase in $B_{\rm
eq}/B_{\rm est}$ at a larger $d$ may suggest the deceleration of the jet around
the downstream, but there is no difference between FR I and FR II jets.

commonly relies on the availability of large amounts of high quality recordings
from each speaker and conditioning the training process on the speaker's
identity or on a learned representation of it. However, when little data is
available from each speaker, or the number of speakers is limited, the
multispeaker TTS can be hard to train and will result in poor speaker
similarity and naturalness.
  In order to address this issue, we explore two directions: forcing the
network to learn a better speaker identity representation by appending an
additional loss term; and augmenting the input data pertaining to each speaker
using waveform manipulation methods. We show that both methods are efficient
when evaluated with both objective and subjective measures. The additional loss
term aids the speaker similarity, while the data augmentation improves the
intelligibility of the multispeaker TTS system.

natural language generation (NLG) systems prone to backdoor attacks and
generate malicious sequences that could be sexist or offensive. Unfortunately,
little effort has been invested to how backdoor attacks can affect current NLG
models and how to defend against these attacks. In this work, by giving a
formal definition of backdoor attack and defense, we investigate this problem
on two important NLG tasks, machine translation and dialog generation. Tailored
to the inherent nature of NLG models (e.g., producing a sequence of coherent
words given contexts), we design defending strategies against attacks. We find
that testing the backward probability of generating sources given targets
yields effective defense performance against all different types of attacks,
and is able to handle the {\it one-to-many} issue in many NLG tasks such as
dialog generation. We hope that this work can raise the awareness of backdoor
risks concealed in deep NLG systems and inspire more future work (both attack
and defense) towards this direction.

occur via an avalanche mechanism, in which \emph{ergodic bubbles} that arise
due to local fluctuations in system properties thermalize their surroundings
leading to delocalization of the system, unless the disorder is sufficiently
strong to stop this process. We propose an algorithm based on neural networks
that allows to detect the ergodic bubbles using experimentally measurable
two-site correlation functions. Investigating time evolution of the system, we
observe a logarithmic in time growth of the ergodic bubbles in the MBL regime.
The distribution of the size of ergodic bubbles converges during time evolution
to an exponentially decaying distribution in the MBL regime, and a power-law
distribution with a thermal peak in the critical regime, supporting thus the
scenario of delocalization through the avalanche mechanism. Our algorithm
permits to pin-point quantitative differences in time evolution of systems with
random and quasiperiodic potentials, as well as to identify rare (Griffiths)
events. Our results open new pathways in studies of the mechanisms of
thermalization of disordered many-body systems and beyond.

(TTS) systems which can output several voice identities. The multi-speaker
(MSPK) scenario also enables the use of fewer training samples per speaker.
However, in the resulting acoustic model, not all speakers exhibit the same
synthetic quality, and some of the voice identities cannot be used at all.
  In this paper we evaluate the influence of the recording conditions, speaker
gender, and speaker particularities over the quality of the synthesised output
of a deep neural TTS architecture, namely Tacotron2. The evaluation is possible
due to the use of a large Romanian parallel spoken corpus containing over 81
hours of data. Within this setup, we also evaluate the influence of different
types of text representations: orthographic, phonetic, and phonetic extended
with syllable boundaries and lexical stress markings.
  We evaluate the results of the MSPK system using the objective measures of
equal error rate (EER) and word error rate (WER), and also look into the
distances between natural and synthesised t-SNE projections of the embeddings
computed by an accurate speaker verification network. The results show that
there is indeed a large correlation between the recording conditions and the
speaker's synthetic voice quality. The speaker gender does not influence the
output, and that extending the input text representation with syllable
boundaries and lexical stress information does not equally enhance the
generated audio across all speaker identities. The visualisation of the t-SNE
projections of the natural and synthesised speaker embeddings show that the
acoustic model shifts some of the speakers' neural representation, but not all
of them. As a result, these speakers have lower performances of the output

matter by studying the suppression of superconductivity in sample geometries
where the roles of electric field and electron-current flow can be clearly
separated. Our results show that suppression of superconductivity does not
depend on the presence or absence of an electric field at the surface of the

most efficient when electrons are injected into the nanowire, but similar
results are obtained also when electrons are passed between two remote
electrodes at a distance $d$ to the nanowire (with $d$ in excess of
$1~\mathrm{\mu m}$). In the latter case, high-energy electrons decay into
phonons which propagate through the substrate and affect superconductivity in
the nanowire by generating quasiparticles. We show that this process involves a
non-thermal phonon distribution, with marked differences from the loss of
superconductivity due to Joule heating near the nanowire or an increase in the
bath temperature.

specify the spectral and sign information required for a unique reconstruction

the spectra of the $N$ nested main minors of the original matrix of the sizes
$1,2,\dots,N$. However, due to the complicated nature of the required sign

where the amount of spectral data exceeds the number of the unknown matrix

guarantee unique reconstruction of {\it generic} matrices, in other words, this
subset of matrices is open, dense and of full measure in the set of real,

between redundancy and genericity by using the freedom of choice of the
spectral information input. We demonstrate our constructions in detail for

auctioneers, both in single-item and multi-unit auctions. In our model, the
auctioneer may collude with the winning bidders by letting them lower their
bids in exchange for a (possibly bidder-dependent) fraction $\gamma$ of the
surplus. We consider different corruption schemes. In the most basic one, all
winning bidders lower their bid to the highest losing bid. We show that this
setting is equivalent to a $\gamma$-hybrid auction in which the payments are a
convex combination of first-price and the second-price payments. More
generally, we consider corruption schemes that can be related to
$\gamma$-approximate first-price auctions ($\gamma$-FPA), where the payments
recover at least a $\gamma$-fraction of the first-price payments. Our goal is
to obtain a precise understanding of the robust price of anarchy (POA) of such
auctions. If no restrictions are imposed on the bids, we prove a bound on the
robust POA of $\gamma$-FPA which is tight (over the entire range of $\gamma$)
for the single-item and the multi-unit auction setting. On the other hand, if
the bids satisfy the no-overbidding assumption a more fine-grained landscape of
the price of anarchy emerges, depending on the auction setting and the
equilibrium notion. Albeit being more challenging, we derive (almost) tight
bounds for both auction settings and several equilibrium notions, basically
leaving open some (small) gaps for the coarse-correlated price of anarchy only.

directly learn abstractions from data. Our approach can be considered a
generalization of classical statistics where we are not interested in
reconstructing `the data' in full, but are instead only concerned with

insertion induces a 23.5 % cell volume increase and a lowering of crystal

second order type transition with a deviation from the isotropic 3D Heisenberg
model towards the 3D XY model. This implies an easy plane of magnetization in
agreement with cell parameter variation showing a planar magnetic orientation.
A weak magnetic peak is even observed at the order-disorder transition with a

the holographic coordinate is violated in the most general way compatible with
the linear Regge behavior of the discrete spectrum in four dimensions. It is
further demonstrated how different Soft Wall (SW) like holographic models

Various interrelations between the emerging models are studied. These models
include the known SW models with different sign in the exponential background,
the SW models with certain generalized backgrounds, with modified metrics, and
No Wall models with 5D mass depending on the holographic coordinate in a simple
polynomial way. We argue that this dependence allows to describe the effects
caused by the main non-local phenomena of strongly coupled 4D gauge theory, the
confinement and chiral symmetry breaking, in terms of a local 5D dual field
theory in the AdS space. We provide a detailed comparison of our approach with

namely on-demand and spot instances, with time-varying features in availability
and price. Users like startups have to operate on a limited budget and
similarly others hope to reduce their costs. While interacting with a CSP,
central to their concerns is the process of cost-effectively utilizing
different purchase options possibly in addition to self-owned instances. A job
in data-intensive applications is typically represented by a directed acyclic
graph which can further be transformed into a chain of tasks. The key to
achieving cost efficiency is determining the allocation of a specific deadline
to each task, as well as the allocation of different types of instances to the
task. In this paper, we propose a framework that determines the optimal
allocation of deadlines to tasks. The framework also features an optimal policy
to determine the allocation of spot and on-demand instances in a predefined
time window, and a near-optimal policy for allocating self-owned instances. The
policies are designed to be parametric to support the usage of online learning
to infer the optimal values against the dynamics of cloud markets. Finally,
several intuitive heuristics are used as baselines to validate the cost
improvement brought by the proposed solutions. We show that the cost
improvement over the state-of-the-art is up to 24.87% when spot and on-demand
instances are considered and up to 59.05% when self-owned instances are
considered.

must defend against attacks that target sensor hardware. Analyzing system
design can help engineers understand how a compromised sensor could impact the
system's behavior; however, designing security analyses for cyber-physical
systems is difficult due to their combination of discrete dynamics, continuous
dynamics, and nondeterminism.
  This paper contributes a framework for modeling and analyzing sensor attacks
on cyber-physical systems, using the formalism of hybrid programs. We formalize
and analyze two relational properties of a system's robustness. These
relational properties respectively express (1) whether a system's safety
property can be influenced by sensor attacks, and (2) whether a system's
high-integrity state can be affected by sensor attacks. We characterize these
relational properties by defining an equivalence relation between a system
under attack and the original unattacked system. That is, the system satisfies
the robustness properties if executions of the attacked system are
appropriately related to executions of the unattacked system.
  We present two techniques for reasoning about the equivalence relation and
thus proving the relational properties for a system. One proof technique
decomposes large proof obligations to smaller proof obligations. The other
proof technique adapts the self-composition technique from the literature on
secure information-flow, allowing us to reduce reasoning about the equivalence
of two systems to reasoning about properties of a single system. This technique
allows us to reuse existing tools for reasoning about properties of hybrid
programs, but is challenging due to the combination of discrete dynamics,
continuous dynamics, and nondeterminism.
  To evaluate, we present three case studies motivated by real design flaws in
existing cyber-physical systems.

clouds, which have a velocity difference of 2.6 km s$^{-1}$ and are extended
over $\sim$5 pc. We frame a scenario that the two clouds are colliding with

$\sim$0.5 Myr which is perpendicular to the collision. It is likely that the
collision formed not only the filamentary cloud but also the two dense cores.
One of the dense cores is associated with the high-mass protostellar candidate
IRAS 05358+3543, a representative high-mass protostar. In the monolithic
collapse scheme of high mass star formation, a compact dense core of 100

that the cloud-cloud collision is an essential process in forming the compact

engineering, such as those arising from discretizations of partial differential
equations. Algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods are one of the most common methods
of solving such linear systems, with an extensive body of underlying
mathematical theory. A system of linear equations defines a graph on the set of
unknowns and each level of a multigrid solver requires the selection of an
appropriate coarse graph along with restriction and interpolation operators
that map to and from the coarse representation. The efficiency of the multigrid
solver depends critically on this selection and many selection methods have
been developed over the years. Recently, it has been demonstrated that it is
possible to directly learn the AMG interpolation and restriction operators,
given a coarse graph selection. In this paper, we consider the complementary
problem of learning to coarsen graphs for a multigrid solver, a necessary step
in developing fully learnable AMG methods. We propose a method using a
reinforcement learning (RL) agent based on graph neural networks (GNNs), which
can learn to perform graph coarsening on small planar training graphs and then
be applied to unstructured large planar graphs, assuming bounded node degree.
We demonstrate that this method can produce better coarse graphs than existing
algorithms, even as the graph size increases and other properties of the graph
are varied. We also propose an efficient inference procedure for performing
graph coarsening that results in linear time complexity in graph size.

hypothesis to explain biodiversity in certain living systems, where the
evolutionary selection principle would dictate a single victor otherwise.
Technically the May--Leonard models offer a mathematical framework to describe
the mentioned non-transitive interaction of competing species when individual
movement is also considered in a spatial system. Emerging rotating spirals
composed by the competing species are frequently observed character of the
resulting patterns. But how do these spiraling patterns change when we vary the
external environment which affects the general vitality of individuals?
Motivated by this question we suggest an off-lattice version of the tradition
May--Leonard model which allows us to change the actual state of the
environment gradually. This can be done by introducing a local carrying
capacity parameter which value can be varied gently in an off-lattice
environment. Our results support a previous analysis obtained in a more
intricate metapopulation model and we show that the well-known rotating spirals
become evident in a benign environment when the general density of the
population is high. The accompanying time-dependent oscillation of competing
species can also be detected where the amplitude and the frequency show a
scaling law of the parameter that characterizes the state of the environment.
These observations highlight that the assumed non-transitive interaction alone
is insufficient condition to maintain biodiversity safely, but the actual state
of the environment, which characterizes the general living conditions, also
plays a decisive role on the evolution of related systems.

involves rethinking the way in which this pipeline takes in and accumulates

one-by-one between an event camera and an SNN, meaning all temporal integration
of information must happen inside the network. In this article, we tackle these
two problems. We focus on the complex task of learning to estimate optical flow
from event-based camera inputs in a self-supervised manner, and modify the

various types of recurrent ANNs and SNNs using the proposed pipeline.
Concerning SNNs, we investigate the effects of elements such as parameter
initialization and optimization, surrogate gradient shape, and adaptive
neuronal mechanisms. We find that initialization and surrogate gradient width
play a crucial part in enabling learning with sparse inputs, while the
inclusion of adaptivity and learnable neuronal parameters can improve

abnormality detection problem when both types of distortions are present in the
cardiac auscultation sound. We first mathematically analyze the effect of
additive and convolutional noise on short-term filterbank-based features and a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layer. Based on the analysis, we propose a
combination of linear and logarithmic spectrogram-image features. These 2D
features are provided as input to a residual CNN network (ResNet) for heart
sound abnormality detection. Experimental validation is performed on an
open-access heart sound abnormality detection dataset involving noisy
recordings obtained from multiple stethoscope sensors. The proposed method
achieves significantly improved results compared to the conventional
approaches, with an area under the ROC (receiver operating characteristics)
curve (AUC) of 91.36%, F-1 score of 84.09%, and Macc (mean of sensitivity and
specificity) of 85.08%. We also show that the proposed method shows the best
mean accuracy across different source domains including stethoscope and noise
variability, demonstrating its effectiveness in different recording conditions.
The proposed combination of linear and logarithmic features along with the

functionalities for autonomous robots. Most state-of-the-art approaches treat
object recognition and grasping as two separate problems, even though both use
visual input. Furthermore, the knowledge of the robot is fixed after the
training phase. In such cases, if the robot encounters new object categories,
it must be retrained to incorporate new information without catastrophic
forgetting. In order to resolve this problem, we propose a deep learning
architecture with an augmented memory capacity to handle open-ended object
recognition and grasping simultaneously. In particular, our approach takes
multi-views of an object as input and jointly estimates pixel-wise grasp
configuration as well as a deep scale- and rotation-invariant representation as
output. The obtained representation is then used for open-ended object
recognition through a meta-active learning technique. We demonstrate the
ability of our approach to grasp never-seen-before objects and to rapidly learn
new object categories using very few examples on-site in both simulation and

vertex to have a high degree, and most vertices are not close to one another.
This trade-off makes cliques more likely to appear between specific vertices.
In this paper, we formalize this trade-off and prove that there exists a
typical type of clique in terms of the degrees and the positions of the
vertices that span the clique. Moreover, we show that the asymptotic number of
cliques as well as the typical clique type undergoes a phase transition, in
which only k and the degree-exponent tau are involved. Interestingly, this
phase transition shows that for small values of tau, the underlying geometry of

Spatial synchronization is a challenge, because of the Poynting instability
that can be a concern both for the interacting electron beam (if

problem is to use an electron beam coming from an accelerator (e.g. the planned
E-320 experiment at FACET-II). Even using a stable accelerator beam, the plane
wave approximation is too simplistic to describe the laser-electron scattering.
This work extends analytical scaling laws for pair production, previously
derived for the case of a plane wave and a short electron beam. We consider a

The results take the spatial and temporal synchronization of the interaction

algorithms and investigate its effect on the complexity of randomized and
deterministic low-space MPC. Our key contributions include:
  1) We revise and formalize the lifting approach of Ghaffari, Kuhn and Uitto.
This requires a very delicate amendment of the notion of component stability,
which allows us to fill in gaps in the earlier arguments.
  2) We also extend the framework to obtain conditional lower bounds for
deterministic algorithms and fine-grained lower bounds that depend on the
maximum degree $\Delta$.
  3) We demonstrate a collection of natural graph problems for which
non-component-stable algorithms break the conditional lower bound obtained for
component-stable algorithms. This implies that, for both deterministic and
randomized algorithms, component-stable algorithms are conditionally weaker
than the non-component-stable ones.
  Altogether our results imply that component-stability might limit the
computational power of the low-space MPC model, at least in certain contexts,
paving the way for improved upper bounds that escape the conditional lower
bound setting of Ghaffari, Kuhn, and Uitto.

detection paradigm, as the latter has evolved into a well-developed area.
However, these detectors are difficult to perform prominently in high-precision
detection due to the limitation of current regression loss design, especially
for objects with large aspect ratios. Taking the perspective that horizontal
detection is a special case for rotated object detection, in this paper, we are
motivated to change the design of rotation regression loss from induction
paradigm to deduction methodology, in terms of the relation between rotation
and horizontal detection. We show that one essential challenge is how to
modulate the coupled parameters in the rotation regression loss, as such the
estimated parameters can influence to each other during the dynamic joint
optimization, in an adaptive and synergetic way. Specifically, we first convert
the rotated bounding box into a 2-D Gaussian distribution, and then calculate
the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) between the Gaussian distributions as the
regression loss. By analyzing the gradient of each parameter, we show that KLD
(and its derivatives) can dynamically adjust the parameter gradients according
to the characteristics of the object. It will adjust the importance (gradient
weight) of the angle parameter according to the aspect ratio. This mechanism
can be vital for high-precision detection as a slight angle error would cause a
serious accuracy drop for large aspect ratios objects. More importantly, we
have proved that KLD is scale invariant. We further show that the KLD loss can
be degenerated into the popular $l_{n}$-norm loss for horizontal detection.

consistent superiority, and codes are available at

provide a unified framework for global optimization problems in the congest
model of distributed computing. Roughly speaking, for a given graph $G$ and a
collection of vertex-disjoint connected subsets $S_1,\ldots, S_\ell \subseteq
V(G)$, $(c,d)$ low-congestion shortcuts augment each subgraph $G[S_i]$ with a
subgraph $H_i \subseteq G$ such that: (i) each edge appears on at most $c$
subgraphs (congestion bound), and (ii) the diameter of each subgraph $G[S_i]
\cup H_i$ is bounded by $d$ (dilation bound). It is desirable to compute
shortcuts of small congestion and dilation as these quantities capture the
round complexity of many global optimization problems in the congest model. For
$n$-vertex graphs with constant diameter $D=O(1)$, Elkin (STOC 2004) presented
an (implicit) shortcuts lower bound with
$c+d=\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{(D-2)/(2D-2)})$. A nearly matching upper bound,
however, was only recently obtained for $D \in \{3,4\}$ by Kitamura et al.
(DISC 2019).
  In this work, we resolve the long-standing complexity gap of shortcuts in
constant diameter graphs, originally posed by Lotker et al. (PODC 2001). We
present new shortcut constructions which match, up to poly-logarithmic terms,
the lower bounds of Das-Sarma et al. As a result, we provide improved and
existentially optimal algorithms for several network optimization tasks in
constant diameter graphs, including MST, $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate minimum

methods, we propose a novel perspective on designing effective nonlinear
feedback control laws for the evader-defender team using a time-constrained

offering itself as bait. At the same time, the defender protects the evader
from the pursuer by exercising control over the engagement duration. Depending
on the nature of the mission, the defender may choose to take an aggressive or
defensive stance. Such consideration widens the applicability of the proposed
methods in various three-agent motion planning scenarios such as aircraft
defense, asset guarding, search and rescue, surveillance, and secure
transportation. We use a fixed-time sliding mode control strategy to design the
control laws for the evader-defender team and a nonlinear finite-time

simulations to demonstrate favorable performance under various engagement

repeated application of Deep RL poses an expensive computational burden as we

empirical game, based on learned responses to a single opponent policy. The
first, Mixed-Oracles, transfers knowledge from previous iterations of Deep RL,
requiring training only against the opponent's newest policy. The second,
Mixed-Opponents, constructs a pure-strategy opponent by mixing existing
strategy's action-value estimates, instead of their policies. Learning against
a single policy mitigates variance in state outcomes that is induced by an
unobserved distribution of opponents. We empirically demonstrate that these

the high Tc superconductors suitable for future ultrahigh field superconducting
magnet applications. In the design and fabrication of such ultrahigh field
REBCO magnets, it is essential to understand the behavior of REBCO coated
conductor. The effect of heating on the properties of commercial REBCO coated
conductors is very important for many practical reasons. Nevertheless, a
comprehensive study on this effect have not yet been presented in the published
literature. This work studies a commercial REBCO coated conductor heat-treated
at temperatures between 175 {\deg}C and 300 {\deg}C for various durations.
Critical current and lap joint resistivity were measured at 77 K and 4.2 K for
the heat-treated samples. We found that critical current degrades with heat
treatment time and temperature. This degradation can be described by a
one-dimensional oxygen out-diffusion model with a diffusion coefficient of D =
2.5 x 10-6 exp (-1.17 eV/kT) m2/s. The heat treatment also causes appreciable
increase in joint resistivity. Comprehensive structural and chemical analyses
were performed on Cu/Ag/RECBO interfaces by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM). Our electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) study provided direct
evidence of oxygen deficiency in the heat treated REBCO samples. In addition,
it is found that the oxygen diffused out of the REBCO layer forms mostly Cu2O
at both Ag/REBCO and Cu/Ag interfaces. Cu2O is also observed at grain
boundaries of the Ag layer. The oxygen out-diffusion model proposed in this
work is used to predict REBCO thermal degradation in several engineering
scenarios.

to automate the GPR data collection process, localize the underground
utilities, interpret and reconstruct the underground objects for better
visualization allowing regular non-professional users to understand the survey
results. This system is composed of three modules: 1) an Omni-directional
robotic data collection platform, that carries an RGB-D camera with an Inertial
Measurement Unit (IMU) and a GPR antenna to perform automatic GPR data
collection, and tag each GPR measurement with visual positioning information at
every sampling step; 2) a learning-based migration module to interpret the raw
GPR B-scan image into a 2D cross-section model of objects; 3) a 3D
reconstruction module, i.e., GPRNet, to generate underground utility model
represented as fine 3D point cloud. Comparative studies are performed on
synthetic data and field GPR raw data with various incompleteness and noise.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves a $30.0\%$
higher GPR imaging accuracy in mean Intersection Over Union (IoU) than the
conventional back projection (BP) migration approach and $6.9\%$-$7.2\%$ less
loss in Chamfer Distance (CD) than baseline methods regarding point cloud model

the Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE), a damped nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation
with forcing that arises in nonlinear optics. So far, nonlinear stability of
such solutions has only been established against co-periodic perturbations by
exploiting the existence of a spectral gap. In this paper, we consider
perturbations which are localized, i.e., integrable on the line. Such localized
perturbations naturally yield the absence of a spectral gap, so we must rely on
a substantially different method with origins in the stability analysis of
periodic waves in reaction-diffusion systems. The relevant linear estimates
have been obtained in recent work by the first three authors through a delicate
decomposition of the associated linearized solution operator. Since its most
critical part just decays diffusively, the nonlinear iteration can only be
closed if one allows for a spatio-temporal phase modulation. However, the
modulated perturbation satisfies a quasilinear equation yielding an apparent
loss of regularity. To overcome this obstacle, we incorporate tame estimates on
the unmodulated perturbation, which satisfies a semilinear equation in which no
derivatives are lost, yet where decay is too slow to close an independent
iteration scheme. We obtain nonlinear stability of periodic steady waves in the
LLE against localized perturbations with precisely the same decay rates as
predicted by the linear theory.

47% reduction in the equatorial zonal wind speed was measured over the 9-month

due to a dramatic slowing and loss of confinement (broadening) of the

tools exactly answer this question, they are of no help in debugging unsafe

produces a provably safe DNN without harming its classification accuracy.
SpecRepair combines specification-based counter-example search and resumes

readout while employing interslice shifts as in blipped-CAIPI acquisitions.
This spreads the aliasing in all spatial directions, thereby taking better
advantage of 3D coil sensitivity profiles. The amount of voxel spreading that
can be achieved by the wave gradients during the short EPI readout period is
constrained by the slew rate of the gradient coils and peripheral nerve
stimulation (PNS) monitor. We propose to use a half-cycle sinusoidal gradient
to increase the amount of voxel spreading that can be achieved while respecting
the slew and stimulation constraints. Extending wave-EPI to multi-shot
acquisition minimizes geometric distortion and voxel blurring at high in-plane
resolution, while structured low-rank regularization mitigates shot-to-shot
phase variations without additional navigators. We propose to use different
point spread functions (PSFs) for the k-space lines with positive and negative
polarities, which are calibrated with a FLEET-based reference scan and allow
for addressing gradient imperfections. Wave-EPI provided whole-brain
single-shot gradient echo (GE) and multi-shot spin echo (SE) EPI acquisitions
at high acceleration factors and was combined with g-Slider slab encoding to
boost the SNR level in 1mm isotropic diffusion imaging. Relative to
blipped-CAIPI, wave-EPI reduced average and maximum g-factors by up to 1.21-

single- and multi-shot EPI with reduced g-factor and artifacts and may
facilitate clinical and neuroscientific applications of EPI by improving the

by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of galaxies. During an
analysis of 1500 images of these AGNs, we identified 10 radio sources with
radial spokes emitted from an unknown source. According to LOFAR, the radial
spokes are artifacts due to calibration errors with no origin, and therefore
they cannot be associated with an optical source. Our preliminary hypothesis
for the artifacts was that they were produced by ionized jets emitted from
quasi-stellar objects (QSOs). Specifically, that strong emissions from Type 1
broadline (BL) quasars were directed in the line of sight of the observer
(i.e., LOFAR) and as a result produced the image artifacts. To test our
hypotheses, we cross-referenced the ra and dec coordinates of the artifacts
with the galactic coordinates indexed in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)
and confirmed that the artifacts were associated with BL QSOs. Further analysis
of the QSOs, moreover, demonstrated they exhibited prominent broad emission
lines such as CIII and MgII, which are characteristic of Type 1 BL quasars. It
is our interpretation, therefore, that the radial spokes characterized as
artifacts by LOFAR were produced by the emission of Type 1 BL quasars in the
line of sight of the radio telescope.

Prediction performance measures are typically robust to violations in causal

of model performance. In this work, we revisit the prediction performance of
several recently proposed causal models tested on a genetic perturbation data

model performance. We propose using a less-biased evaluation set for assessing
prediction performance and compare models on this new set. In this setting, the
causal models have similar or worse performance compared to standard
association-based estimators such as Lasso. Finally, we compare the performance
of causal estimators in simulation studies that reproduce the Kemmeren
structure of genetic knockout experiments but without any sample selection
bias. These results provide an improved understanding of the performance of
several causal models and offer guidance on how future studies should use

matters including highly secluded dark matter particles. The portal coupling is
so feeble that dark matter is produced by freeze-in processes of scatterings
and/or the decay of the mediator. We consider two concrete realizations of the
portal: conformally induced Higgs portal and conformally induced mediator
portal. The former case is compatible with the Higgs inflation, while the
latter case can be tested by dark matter direct detection experiments.

gained great interest for next-generation display and lighting technologies
prized for their color purity, high brightness and luminous efficiency
approaching the intrinsic limit imposed by extraction of electroluminescence
from the device structure. Although the time is ripe for the development of
effective light outcoupling strategies to further boost the device performance,
this technologically relevant aspect of PNC-LEDs is still without a definitive
solution. Here, following theoretical guidelines and without the integration of
complex photonic structures, we realize stable PNC-LEDs with EQE as high as
29.2% (average EQE=24.7%), which substantially break the outcoupling limit of
common PNC-LEDs and systematically surpass any previous perovskite-based
device. Key to such unprecedented performance is channeling the recombination
zone in PNC emissive layers as thin as 10 nm, which we achieve by finely
balancing the electron and hole transport using CsPbBr3 PNCs resurfaced with a
nickel oxide layer. The ultra-thin approach general and, in principle,
applicable to other perovskite nanostructures for fabricating highly efficient,
color tunable transparent LEDs ideal for unobtrusive screens and displays and
is compatible with the integration of photonic components for further enhanced
performance.

fit a global relation between [$\alpha$/Fe] and the galaxy velocity dispersion
$\sigma$ for red sequence galaxies,
[$\alpha$/Fe]=(0.378$\pm$0.009)log($\sigma$/100)+(0.155$\pm$0.003). We observe
a correlation between the residuals and the local environmental surface
density, whereas no such relation exists for blue cloud galaxies. In the full
sample, we find that elliptical galaxies in high-density environments are
$\alpha$-enhanced by up to 0.057$\pm$0.014 dex at velocity dispersions
$\sigma$<100 km/s, compared with those in low-density environments. This
$\alpha$-enhancement is morphology-dependent, with the offset decreasing along
the Hubble sequence towards spirals, which have an offset of 0.019$\pm$0.014
dex. At low velocity dispersion and controlling for morphology, we estimate
that star formation in high-density environments is truncated $\sim1$ Gyr
earlier than in low-density environments. For elliptical galaxies only, we find
support for a parabolic relationship between [$\alpha$/Fe] and $\sigma$, with
an environmental $\alpha$-enhancement of at least 0.03 dex. This suggests
strong contributions from both environment and mass-based quenching mechanisms.
However, there is no evidence for this behaviour in later morphological types.

the hybrid cavities proposed so far, mainly consisting of metallic bow-tie
antennas, the plasmonic gap sizes defined by lithography in a repeatable way
are limited to minimum values \approx 10 nm. Nanoparticle-on-a-mirror (NPoM)
cavities are far superior to achieve the smallest possible mode volumes, as

nanoparticle can be placed very close (< 1 nm) to the upper surface of the
dielectric cavity, which acts as a low-reflectivity mirror. We demonstrate
through numerical calculations that this kind of hybrid plasmonic-photonic

part obtained through analytical approximations. With these cross sections the
work of Song $\textit{et al.}$ [J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data, $\textbf{44}$,
023101, (2015)] can be extended which results in a complete and consistent set
of cross sections for the collision of electrons with up to 100 eV energy with
methane molecules. Notably, the resulting cross section set does not require
any data fitting to produce bulk swarm parameters that match with experiments.
Therefore consistency can be considered an inherent trait of the set, since
swarm parameters are used exclusively for validation of the cross sections.
Neutral dissociation of methane is essential to include (1) because it is a
crucial electron energy sink in methane plasma, and (2) because it largely
contributes to the production of hydrogen radicals that can be vital for
plasma-chemical processes. Finally, we compare the production rates of hydrogen
species for a swarm-fitted data set with ours. The two consistent cross section
sets predict different production rates, with differences of $45\%$ (at $100$
Td) and $125\%$ (at $50$ Td) for production of H$_2$ and a similar trend for
production of H. With this comparison we underline that the swarm-fitting
procedure, used to ensure consistency of the electron swarm parameters, can
possibly deteriorate the accuracy with which chemical production rates are
estimated. This is of particular importance for applications with an emphasis

interest in their use in matching markets (e.g., labor). While this holds
potential for improving market fluidity and fairness, we show in this paper
that naively applying existing recommender systems to matching markets is
sub-optimal. Considering the standard process where candidates apply and then
get evaluated by employers, we present a new recommendation framework to model
this interaction mechanism and propose efficient algorithms for computing

to not only account for the potentially divergent preferences of candidates and

conventional ranking systems that merely rank by some local score (e.g.,
one-sided or reciprocal relevance) highly sub-optimal -- not only for an
individual user, but also for societal goals (e.g., low unemployment). To
address this shortcoming, we propose the first method for jointly optimizing

strategy yields pairs of continuous benchmark measures in high-dimensional

perform well in downstream tasks, many do not faithfully recover optimal

the solvers in a setting of image generation. Our study reveals crucial
limitations of existing solvers and shows that increased OT accuracy does not
necessarily correlate to better results downstream.

for inference and estimation problems on heterogeneous diffusion networks. Our
new framework leverages the Mori-Zwanzig formalism to obtain an exact evolution
equation of the individual node infection probabilities, which renders a delay
differential equation with memory integral approximated by learnable time
convolution operators. Directly using information diffusion cascade data, our
framework can simultaneously learn the structure of the diffusion network and
the evolution of node infection probabilities. Connections between parameter
learning and optimal control are also established, leading to a rigorous and
implementable algorithm for training NMF. Moreover, we show that the projected
gradient descent method can be employed to solve the challenging influence
maximization problem, where the gradient is computed extremely fast by
integrating NMF forward in time just once in each iteration. Extensive
empirical studies show that our approach is versatile and robust to variations
of the underlying diffusion network models, and significantly outperform
existing approaches in accuracy and efficiency on both synthetic and real-world

single classifier based prediction task. What are the fairness impacts of the

that often the root cause of unfairness is ingrained in the data itself, rather

caused by a specific transformation made in the data preprocessing stage. In
this paper, we introduced the causal method of fairness to reason about the
fairness impact of data preprocessing stages in ML pipeline. We leveraged
existing metrics to define the fairness measures of the stages. Then we
conducted a detailed fairness evaluation of the preprocessing stages in 37

data transformers are causing the model to exhibit unfairness. We identified a
number of fairness patterns in several categories of data transformers.
Finally, we showed how the local fairness of a preprocessing stage composes in

evaluation metrics may compromise the validity and realism of evaluation
results. In the present work, we discuss these concerns and conduct a
systematic posthoc verification experiment on the entity linking (EL) task.
Unlike traditional methodologies, which asks annotators to provide free-form
annotations, we ask annotators to verify the correctness of annotations after
the fact (i.e., posthoc). Compared to pre-annotation evaluation,
state-of-the-art EL models performed extremely well according to the posthoc

class of Riemannian manifolds. Gaussian distributions on manifolds are harder
to make use of in applications since the normalisation factors, which we will
refer to as partition functions, are complicated, intractable integrals in
general that depend in a highly non-linear way on the mean of the given
distribution. Nonetheless, on Riemannian symmetric spaces, the partition
functions are independent of the mean and reduce to integrals over finite
dimensional vector spaces. These are generally still hard to compute
numerically when the dimension (more precisely the rank $N$) of the underlying
symmetric space gets large. On the space of positive definite Hermitian
matrices, it is possible to compute these integrals exactly using methods from
random matrix theory and the so-called Stieltjes-Wigert polynomials. In other
cases of interest to applications, such as the space of symmetric positive
definite (SPD) matrices or the Siegel domain (related to block-Toeplitz
covariance matrices), these methods seem not to work quite as well.
Nonetheless, it remains possible to compute leading order terms in a large $N$
limit, which provide increasingly accurate approximations as $N$ grows. This
limit is inspired by realizing a given partition function as the partition
function of a zero-dimensional quantum field theory or even Chern-Simons
theory. From this point of view the large $N$ limit arises naturally and
saddle-point methods, Feynman diagrams, and certain universalities that relate
different spaces emerge.

experts and novices using a robotic control device designed for endoscopic
surgery permits defining benchmark criteria that tell true expert task skills
from the skills of novices or trainee surgeons. Grip force variability in a
true expert and a complete novice executing a robot assisted surgical simulator
task reveal statistically significant differences as a function of task
expertise. Here we show that the skill specific differences in local grip
forces are predicted by the output metric of a Self Organizing neural network
Map (SOM) with a bio inspired functional architecture that maps the functional
connectivity of somatosensory neural networks in the primate brain.

version of the article is devoted to the study of the asymptotics of the
moments of arithmetic functions that have a limit distribution on the natural

for the German science system. The funds of the German Research Foundation
(DFG) serve as the central focus due to the high reputation of the foundation.
However, it has not been clarified yet to what extent the chances of
successfully acquiring these funds depend on the structure of the university as
an institution. The present study analyses DFG funding in the context of
university research and examines the role of organisational conditions in the
acquisition of funding. Several factors, such as size of the institution,
equipment, and teaching activities, are analysed. The empirical study focuses
on four subjects and investigates the correlation between funding success and
conditional factors using a Bayesian approach. Results reveal the considerable
relevance of the factors size as well as provision of academic and non-academic
personnel. This implies that the organisational conditions are to be taken into
account while evaluating third-party financing success.

  figures. In review at NEURIPS 2021",,,,"physics.chem-ph cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Deep learning based molecular graph generation and optimization has recently
been attracting attention due to its great potential for de novo drug design.
On the one hand, recent models are able to efficiently learn a given graph
distribution, and many approaches have proven very effective to produce a
molecule that maximizes a given score. On the other hand, it was shown by
previous studies that generated optimized molecules are often unrealistic, even
with the inclusion of mechanics to enforce similarity to a dataset of real drug
molecules. In this work we use a hybrid approach, where the dataset
distribution is learned using an autoregressive model while the score
optimization is done using the Metropolis algorithm, biased toward the learned
distribution. We show that the resulting method, that we call learned realism
sampling (LRS), produces empirically more realistic molecules and outperforms
all recent baselines in the task of molecule optimization with similarity
constraints.

counterpart in prior work on steerable convolutional neural networks
equivariant to rigid transformations. In our work, we propose a steerable
feed-forward learning-based approach that consists of neurons with spherical
decision surfaces and operates on point clouds. Such spherical neurons are
obtained by conformal embedding of Euclidean space and have recently been
revisited in the context of learning representations of point sets. Focusing on
3D geometry, we exploit the isometry property of spherical neurons and derive a
3D steerability constraint. After training spherical neurons to classify point
clouds in a canonical orientation, we use a tetrahedron basis to quadruplicate
the neurons and construct rotation-equivariant spherical filter banks. We then
apply the derived constraint to interpolate the filter bank outputs and, thus,
obtain a rotation-invariant network. Finally, we use a synthetic point set and
real-world 3D skeleton data to verify our theoretical findings. The code is
available at https://github.com/pavlo-melnyk/steerable-3d-neurons.

associated with image classification using machine learning algorithms, named
the nonuniform defocus removal (NDR) problem. Mathematical analysis of the NDR
problem is done and the so-called defocus removal (DR) algorithm for solving it
is proposed. Global convergence of the DR algorithm is established without
imposing any unverifiable assumption. Numerical results on simulation data show
significant features of DR including solvability, noise robustness,
convergence, model insensitivity and computational efficiency. Physical
relevance of the NDR problem and practicability of the DR algorithm are tested
on experimental data. Back to the application that originally motivated the
investigation of the NDR problem, we show that the DR algorithm can improve the
accuracy of classifying distorted images using convolutional neural networks.
The key difference of this paper compared to most existing works on
single-frame anisoplanatic deconvolution is that the new method does not
require the data image to be decomposable into isoplanatic subregions.
Therefore, solution approaches partitioning the image into isoplanatic zones
are not applicable to the NDR problem and those handling the entire image such
as the DR algorithm need to be developed and analyzed.

  Deep Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.NI cs.AI cs.HC cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper investigates the problem of providing ultra-reliable and
energy-efficient virtual reality (VR) experiences for wireless mobile users. To
ensure reliable ultra-high-definition (UHD) video frame delivery to mobile
users and enhance their immersive visual experiences, a coordinated multipoint
(CoMP) transmission technique and millimeter wave (mmWave) communications are
exploited. Owing to user movement and time-varying wireless channels, the
wireless VR experience enhancement problem is formulated as a
sequence-dependent and mixed-integer problem with a goal of maximizing users'
feeling of presence (FoP) in the virtual world, subject to power consumption
constraints on access points (APs) and users' head-mounted displays (HMDs). The
problem, however, is hard to be directly solved due to the lack of users'
accurate tracking information and the sequence-dependent and mixed-integer
characteristics. To overcome this challenge, we develop a parallel echo state
network (ESN) learning method to predict users' tracking information by
training fresh and historical tracking samples separately collected by APs.
With the learnt results, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based
optimization algorithm to solve the formulated problem. In this algorithm, we
implement deep neural networks (DNNs) as a scalable solution to produce integer
decision variables and solving a continuous power control problem to criticize
the integer decision variables. Finally, the performance of the proposed
algorithm is compared with various benchmark algorithms, and the impact of
different design parameters is also discussed. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm is more 4.14% energy-efficient than the benchmark
algorithms.
