communication (DFRC) system is proposed, that uses the available bandwidth
efficiently for both sensing and communication. The proposed system, referred
to as Shared-Subcarriers DFRC (SS-DFRC) transmits wideband, orthogonal
frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveforms and allows the transmit
antennas to use subcarriers in a shared fashion. A novel, low complexity target
estimation approach is proposed to overcome the coupling of radar target
parameters and transmitted symbols that arises in that case. When all
subcarriers are used in a shared fashion, the proposed system achieves high
communication rate but its sensing performance is limited by the size of the
receive array. We show that when some of the subcarriers are reserved for
exclusive use by one transmit antenna each (private subcarriers), the
communication rate can be traded off for improved sensing performance. The
latter can be achieved by using the private subcarriers to construct a larger
aperture virtual array that yields higher resolution angle estimates. The
system is endowed with beamforming capability, via waveform precoding, where
the precoding matrix is optimally designed to meet a joint
sensing-communication system performance metric.

non-paraxial fields leading to various manifestations of the spin and orbital
Hall effect. However, effects of spin-orbit interaction (SOI) have not been
explored extensively for higher order Gaussian beams carrying no intrinsic
orbital angular momentum. Indeed, the SOI effects on such structured beams can
be directly visualized due to azimuthal rotation of their transverse intensity
profiles - a phenomenon we call the rotational Hall effect. In this paper, we
show that for an input circularly polarized (right/left) $HG_{10}$ mode, SOI
leads to a significant azimuthal rotation of the transverse intensity
distribution of both the orthogonal circularly polarized (left/right)
component, and the transverse component of the longitudinal field intensity
with respect to the input intensity profile. We validate our theoretical and
numerically simulated results experimentally by tightly focusing a circularly
polarized $HG_{10}$ beam in an optical tweezers configuration, and projecting
out the opposite circular polarization component and the transverse component
of the longitudinal field intensity at the output of the tweezers. We also
measure the rotational shift as a function of the refractive index contrast in
the path of the tightly focused light, and in general observe a proportional
increase. The enhanced spin-orbit conversion in these cases may lead to
interesting applications in inducing complex dynamics in optically trapped
birefringent particles using higher order Gaussian beams with no intrinsic
orbital angular momentum.

displaying a macroscopic limit in which the logarithm of the probability
distribution is proportional to a scale-independent rate function (i.e., a

expression for the probability distribution valid away from equilibrium, we
propose a linear response theory performed at the level of the rate function.
We show that the first order non-equilibrium contribution to the steady state
rate function, $g(x)$, satisfies $u(x)\cdot \nabla g(x) = -\beta \dot W(x)$
where the vector field $u(x)$ defines the macroscopic deterministic dynamics,
and the scalar field $\dot W(x)$ equals the rate at which work is performed on
the system in a given state $x$. This equation provides a practical way to
determine $g(x)$, significantly outperforms standard linear response theory
applied at the level of the probability distribution, and approximates the rate
function surprisingly well in some far-from-equilibrium conditions. The method
applies to a wealth of physical and chemical systems, that we exemplify by two
analytically tractable models - an electrical circuit and an autocatalytic
chemical reaction network - both undergoing a non-equilibrium transition from a
monostable phase to a bistable phase. Our approach can be easily generalized to
transient probabilities and non-autonomous dynamics. Moreover, its recursive
application generates a virtual flow in the probability space which allows to
determine the steady state rate function arbitrarily far from equilibrium.

around young stars. The temperature of grains depends on their size. We
evaluate the impact of this temperature dependence on the disk chemistry. We
model a moderately massive disk with 16 different grain sizes. We use POLARIS
to calculate the dust grain temperatures and the local UV flux. We model the
chemistry using the 3-phase astrochemical code NAUTILUS. Photoprocesses are
handled using frequency-dependent cross-sections, and a new method to account
for self and mutual shielding. The multi-grain model outputs are compared to
those of single-grain size models (0.1 $\mu$m), with two different assumptions
for their equivalent temperature. We find that the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (LH)
mechanism at equilibrium temperature is not efficient to form H$_2$ at 3-4
scale heights ($H$), and adopt a parametric fit to a stochastic method to model
H$_2$ formation instead. We find the molecular layer composition (1-3 $H$) to
depend on the amount of remaining H atoms. Differences in molecular surface
densities between single and multi-grain models are mostly due to what occurs
above 1.5 $H$. At 100 au, models with colder grains produce H$_2$O and CH$_4$
ices in the midplane, and warmer ones produce more CO$_2$ ices, both allowing
efficient depletion of C and O as soon as CO sticks on grain surfaces. Complex
organic molecules (COMs) production is enhanced by the presence of warmer
grains in the multi-grain models. Using a single grain model mimicking grain
growth and dust settling fails to reproduce the complexity of gas-grain
chemistry. Chemical models with a single grain size are sensitive to the
adopted grain temperature, and cannot account for all expected effects. A
spatial spread of the snowlines is expected to result from the ranges in grain
temperature. The amplitude of the effects will depend on the dust disk mass.

the solution at irregular points on a nine point compact stencil such that the
higher-order compactness is maintained throughout the whole computational
domain. The scheme is employed to solve four problems embedded with circular
and star shaped interfaces in a rectangular region having analytical solutions
and varied discontinuities across the interface in source and the coefficient
terms. We also simulate a plethora of fluid flow problems past bluff bodies in
complex flow situations, which are governed by the Navier-Stokes equations;
they include problems involving multiple bodies immersed in the flow as well.
In the process, we show the superiority of the proposed strategy over the EJIIM
and other existing IIM methods by establishing the rate of convergence and grid
independence of the computed solutions. In all the cases our computed results
extremely close to the available numerical and experimental results.

presence of such a gap is a signature of topological spin excitations if it
arises from the next nearest neighbor(NNN) Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) or

Alternatively, the gap is suggested to arise from an electron correlation
effect not associated with topological spin excitations. Here we use inelastic
neutron scattering to conclusively demonstrate that the Kitaev interactions and
electron correlation effects cannot describe spin waves, Dirac gap and their

the nearest neighbor (NN) magnetic exchange interactions along the axis are

Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for the maximum cut problem, and
their relationship to that of classical algorithms.
  (1) We prove that every (quantum or classical) one-local algorithm achieves
on $D$-regular graphs of girth $> 5$ a maximum cut of at most $1/2 +
C/\sqrt{D}$ for $C=1/\sqrt{2} \approx 0.7071$. This is the first such result
showing that one-local algorithms achieve a value bounded away from the true
optimum for random graphs, which is $1/2 + P_*/\sqrt{D} + o(1/\sqrt{D})$ for
$P_* \approx 0.7632$. (2) We show that there is a classical $k$-local algorithm
that achieves a value of $1/2 + C/\sqrt{D} - O(1/\sqrt{k})$ for $D$-regular
graphs of girth $> 2k+1$, where $C = 2/\pi \approx 0.6366$. This is an
algorithmic version of the existential bound of Lyons and is related to the
algorithm of Aizenman, Lebowitz, and Ruelle (ALR) for the
Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. This bound is better than that achieved by the
one-local and two-local versions of QAOA on high-girth graphs. (3) Through
computational experiments, we give evidence that the ALR algorithm achieves
better performance than constant-locality QAOA for random $D$-regular graphs,
as well as other natural instances, including graphs that do have short cycles.
  Our experimental work suggests that it could be possible to extend beyond our
theoretical constraints. This points at the tantalizing possibility that
$O(1)$-local quantum maximum-cut algorithms might be *pointwise dominated* by
polynomial-time classical algorithms, in the sense that there is a classical
algorithm outputting cuts of equal or better quality *on every possible

text and images), as they are often harder to decipher than unimodal content

(0.771) outperforming other models' F1 scores (0.544, 0.737, and 0.754). While
the unimodal-text context-aware (transformer) model was the most accurate on

tasks with sparse rewards. Such challenging tasks can be decomposed into
sub-tasks that are accomplishable by different robots concurrently or
sequentially for better efficiency. While previous reinforcement learning
approaches primarily focus on modeling the compositionality of sub-tasks, two
fundamental issues are largely ignored particularly when learning cooperative
strategies for two robots: (i) domination, i.e., one robot may try to solve a
task by itself and leaves the other idle; (ii) conflict, i.e., one robot can
interrupt another's workspace when executing different sub-tasks
simultaneously, which leads to unsafe collisions. To tackle these two issues,
we propose a novel technique called disentangled attention, which provides an
intrinsic regularization for two robots to focus on separate sub-tasks and
objects. We evaluate our method on five bimanual manipulation tasks.
Experimental results show that our proposed intrinsic regularization
successfully avoids domination and reduces conflicts for the policies, which
leads to significantly more efficient and safer cooperative strategies than all
the baselines. Our project page with videos is at

cross section is defined, appropriate for high-resolution measurements. The
dependence of the broadband scattering cross section, $\sigma_{bb}$ and the
scintillation index, $SI$ on resolution was investigated for one-dimensional
rough surfaces with power-law spectra and backscattering geometries. Using
integral equations and Fourier synthesis, no resolution dependence of

cross section has negligible bandwidth dependence. $SI$ increases as resolution
increases, grazing angle decreases, and spectral strength increases. This trend

power-law spectral exponents of 1.5, 2, and 2.5. The hypothesis that local
tilting at the scale of the acoustic resolution is responsible for intensity
fluctuations was examined using a representative model for the effect of slopes

are responsible in part for the fluctuations, but other effects, such as
multiple scattering and shadowing may also play a role.

has been an active area of research in the last decade. Most previous methods
attempt to focus on the diseased organs of the image by identifying spatial
regions responsible for significant contributions to the model's prediction. In
contrast, expert radiologists first locate the prominent anatomical structures
before determining if those regions are anomalous. Therefore, integrating
anatomical knowledge within deep learning models could bring substantial
improvement in automatic disease classification. Motivated by this, we propose
Anatomy-XNet, an anatomy-aware attention-based thoracic disease classification
network that prioritizes the spatial features guided by the pre-identified
anatomy regions. We adopt a semi-supervised learning method by utilizing
available small-scale organ-level annotations to locate the anatomy regions in
large-scale datasets where the organ-level annotations are absent. The proposed
Anatomy-XNet uses the pre-trained DenseNet-121 as the backbone network with two
corresponding structured modules, the Anatomy Aware Attention (A$^3$) and
Probabilistic Weighted Average Pooling (PWAP), in a cohesive framework for
anatomical attention learning. We experimentally show that our proposed method
sets a new state-of-the-art benchmark by achieving an AUC score of 85.78%,
92.07%, and, 84.04% on three publicly available large-scale CXR datasets--NIH,
Stanford CheXpert, and MIMIC-CXR, respectively. This not only proves the
efficacy of utilizing the anatomy segmentation knowledge to improve the
thoracic disease classification but also demonstrates the generalizability of
the proposed framework.

many institutions and educators to turn to online proctoring services to

this paper, we explore the security and privacy perceptions of the student

findings indicate that participants are concerned about both the amount and the
personal nature of the information shared with the exam proctoring companies.
However, many participants also recognize a trade-off between pandemic safety
concerns and the arguably invasive means by which proctoring services ensure
exam integrity. Our findings also suggest that institutional power dynamics and

remote proctoring.

the algebraic simplicity of its final form, its derivation is rather complex.
As a result, studies clarifying the intuition behind the estimator or
rigorously investigating its properties have been severely lacking. This work
aims to take a step forward on both fronts. We demonstrate that surprisingly,
the exact form of the IJ estimator can be obtained via a straightforward linear
regression of the individual bootstrap estimates on their respective weights or
via the classical jackknife. The latter realization is particularly useful as
it allows us to formally investigate the bias of the IJ variance estimator and
better characterize the settings in which its use is appropriate. Finally, we
extend these results to the case of U-statistics where base models are
constructed via subsampling rather than bootstrapping and provide a consistent

novel inference mechanism called IFAinference. This enables an ordinary text
recognizer to process multi-line text such that text detection can be
completely freed. Specifically, we integrate IFA into the two most prevailing
text recognition streams (attention-based and CTC-based) and propose
attention-guided dense prediction (ADP) and Extended CTC (ExCTC). Furthermore,
the Wasserstein-based Hollow Aggregation Cross-Entropy (WH-ACE) is proposed to
suppress negative predictions to assist in training ADP and ExCTC. We
experimentally demonstrate that IFA achieves state-of-the-art performance on

been an invaluable tool for understanding quantum-scale atomic and molecular

topic of controversy and debate. It was claimed by Rousseau and Felbacq in the
article Scientific Reports 7, 11115 (2017) that Hamiltonian multipolar QED is
not the same as Poincare-gauge QED and that it is not generally equivalent to
Coulomb-gauge QED. This claim has subsequently been refuted, but since both
sides of the debate appear technically sound, a clear reconciliation remains to
be given. This task is of paramount importance due to the widespread use of
multipolar QED in quantum optics and atomic physics. Here, unlike in other
responses, we adopt the same method as Rousseau and Felbacq of using Dirac's
constrained quantisation procedure. However, our treatment shows that
Poincare-gauge and multipolar QED are identical. We identify the precise source
of the apparent incompatibility of previous results as nothing more than a
semantic mismatch. In fact there are no inconsistencies. Our results firmly and
rigorously solidify the multipolar theory.

analytically derive multiple techniques for variance reduction of the training

the benefit of scale in learning rich representations for Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) with limited paired data, such as wav2vec 2.0. We investigate
the existence of sparse subnetworks in pre-trained speech SSL models that
achieve even better low-resource ASR results. However, directly applying widely
adopted pruning methods such as the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) is
suboptimal in the computational cost needed. Moreover, we show that the
discovered subnetworks yield minimal performance gain compared to the original

finetunes subnetworks for much better performance, while only requiring a
single downstream ASR finetuning run. PARP is inspired by our surprising
observation that subnetworks pruned for pre-training tasks need merely a slight
adjustment to achieve a sizeable performance boost in downstream ASR tasks.
Extensive experiments on low-resource ASR verify (1) sparse subnetworks exist
in mono-lingual/multi-lingual pre-trained speech SSL, and (2) the computational
advantage and performance gain of PARP over baseline pruning methods. In
particular, on the 10min Librispeech split without LM decoding, PARP discovers
subnetworks from wav2vec 2.0 with an absolute 10.9%/12.6% WER decrease compared

cross-lingual pruning without any phone recognition degradation, the discovery

generalizations of this problem: mixtures of linear regressions, and mixtures
of linear classifiers, where the goal is to recover supports of multiple sparse
vectors using only a small number of possibly noisy linear, and 1-bit
measurements respectively. The key challenge is that the measurements from
different vectors are randomly mixed. Both of these problems have also received

correspond to the side of queried hyperplane a random unknown vector lies in,
whereas in mixtures of linear regressions we observe the projection of a random
unknown vector on the queried hyperplane. The primary step in recovering the
unknown vectors from the mixture is to first identify the support of all the
individual component vectors. In this work, we study the number of measurements
sufficient for recovering the supports of all the component vectors in a

invariance to appearance transformation such as color jitter. However, the task

Exhaustively covering this wide range of factors in fully annotated datasets

adversarial training and motion modelling to tap into unlabeled videos. To this
end we propose what to the best of our knowledge is the first motion model for
hands and show that an adversarial formulation leads to better generalization
properties of the hand pose estimator via semi-supervised training on unlabeled

sequence of hand poses, as determined by a discriminative adversary. This
adversary reasons both on the structural as well as temporal domain,
effectively exploiting the spatio-temporal structure in the task. The main
advantage of our approach is that we can make use of unpaired videos and joint
sequence data both of which are much easier to attain than paired training

that any given layer's success/failure can be accurately predicted. In this
work, we take a first step towards this goal by extending known properties of
BatchNorm in randomly initialized deep neural networks (DNNs) to several
recently proposed normalization layers. Our primary findings follow: (i)
similar to BatchNorm, activations-based normalization layers can prevent
exponential growth of activations in ResNets, but parametric techniques require
explicit remedies; (ii) use of GroupNorm can ensure an informative forward
propagation, with different samples being assigned dissimilar activations, but
increasing group size results in increasingly indistinguishable activations for
different samples, explaining slow convergence speed in models with LayerNorm;
and (iii) small group sizes result in large gradient norm in earlier layers,
hence explaining training instability issues in Instance Normalization and
illustrating a speed-stability tradeoff in GroupNorm. Overall, our analysis
reveals a unified set of mechanisms that underpin the success of normalization
methods in deep learning, providing us with a compass to systematically explore
the vast design space of DNN normalization layers.

non-sub-Gaussian (heavy-tailed) noise. To derive our results, we propose novel
stepsize rules for two stochastic methods with gradient clipping. Moreover, our
analysis works for generalized smooth objectives with H\""older-continuous
gradients, and for both methods, we provide an extension for strongly convex
problems. Finally, our results imply that the first (accelerated) method we
consider also has optimal iteration and oracle complexity in all the regimes,
and the second one is optimal in the non-smooth setting.

La$_{1.6-x}$Nd$_{0.4}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$ (Nd-LSCO), performed in magnetic fields
large enough to suppress superconductivity down to low temperature. We use the
Seebeck coefficient as a probe of the particle-hole asymmetry of the electronic
structure across the pseudogap critical doping $p^{\star} = 0.23$. Outside the
pseudogap phase, at $p = 0.24 > p^{\star}$, we observe a positive and
essentially isotropic Seebeck coefficient as $T \rightarrow 0$. That $S > 0$ at
$p = 0.24$ is at odds with expectations given the electronic band structure of
Nd-LSCO above $p^{\star}$ and its known electron-like Fermi surface. We can
reconcile this observation by invoking an energy-dependent scattering rate with
a particle-hole asymmetry, possibly rooted in the non-Fermi liquid nature of
cuprates just above $p^{\star}$. Inside the pseudogap phase, for $ p <
p^{\star}$, $S_{\rm a}$ is seen to rise at low temperature as previously
reported, consistent with the drop in carrier density $n$ from $n \simeq 1 + p$
to $n \simeq p$ across $p^{\star}$ as inferred from other transport properties.
In stark contrast, $S_{\rm c}$ at low temperature becomes negative below
$p^{\star}$, a novel signature of the pseudogap phase. The sudden drop in
$S_{\rm c}$ reveals a change in the electronic structure of Nd-LSCO upon
crossing $p^{\star}$. We can exclude a profound change of the scattering across
$p^{\star}$ and conclude that the change in the out-of-plane Seebeck
coefficient originates from a transformation of the Fermi surface.

modeling and handling: i) uncertainty about the predictions, and ii) symmetric
objects with multiple (sometimes infinite) correct poses. To this end, we
introduce a method to estimate arbitrary, non-parametric distributions on
SO(3). Our key idea is to represent the distributions implicitly, with a neural
network that estimates the probability given the input image and a candidate
pose. Grid sampling or gradient ascent can be used to find the most likely
pose, but it is also possible to evaluate the probability at any pose, enabling
reasoning about symmetries and uncertainty. This is the most general way of
representing distributions on manifolds, and to showcase the rich expressive
power, we introduce a dataset of challenging symmetric and nearly-symmetric
objects. We require no supervision on pose uncertainty -- the model trains only
with a single pose per example. Nonetheless, our implicit model is highly
expressive to handle complex distributions over 3D poses, while still obtaining
accurate pose estimation on standard non-ambiguous environments, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on Pascal3D+ and ModelNet10-SO(3) benchmarks.

extraordinary ability to watch others and learn maneuvers that they themselves

actions. However, such measurements cannot be directly accessed for the non-ego
vehicles when learning by watching others. Therefore, in an application where
data is regarded as a highly valuable asset, current approaches completely
discard the vast portion of the training data that can be potentially obtained

insight, we propose the Learning by Watching (LbW) framework which enables
learning a driving policy without requiring full knowledge of neither the state

maneuvers, LbW makes use of the demonstrations of other vehicles in a given
scene by (1) transforming the ego-vehicle's observations to their points of
view, and (2) inferring their expert actions. Our LbW agent learns more robust
driving policies while enabling data-efficient learning, including quick
adaptation of the policy to rare and novel scenarios. In particular, LbW drives
robustly even with a fraction of available driving data required by existing

computational overheads due to the additional modelling of the temporal

of which scales linearly with the number of frames in the video sequence and
hence induces no overhead compared to an image-based Transformer model. To
achieve this, our model makes two approximations to the full space-time
attention used in Video Transformers: (a) It restricts time attention to a
local temporal window and capitalizes on the Transformer's depth to obtain full
temporal coverage of the video sequence. (b) It uses efficient space-time
mixing to attend jointly spatial and temporal locations without inducing any
additional cost on top of a spatial-only attention model. We also show how to
integrate 2 very lightweight mechanisms for global temporal-only attention
which provide additional accuracy improvements at minimal computational cost.
We demonstrate that our model produces very high recognition accuracy on the
most popular video recognition datasets while at the same time being
significantly more efficient than other Video Transformer models. Code will be

fates, explosion or implosion, and remnant masses based on one or two stellar
parameters at the evolutionary cutoff imposed by the code, usually at or near
central carbon ignition. In doing this, BPS disregards the integral role
late-stage evolution plays in determining the final fate, remnant type, and
remnant mass within the neutrino-driven explosion paradigm. To highlight
differences between a popular prescription which relies only on the core and
final stellar mass and emerging methods which rely on a star's presupernova
core structure, we generate a series of compact object distributions using
three different methods for a sample population of single and binary stars
computed in BPASS. The first method estimates remnant mass based on a star's
carbon-oxygen (CO) core mass and final total mass. The second method uses the
presupernova core structure based on the bare CO-core models of \citet{Pat20}
combined with a parameterized explosion criterion to first determine final fate
and remnant type, then remnant mass. The third method associates presupernova
helium-core masses with remnant masses determined from public explosion models
which rely implicitly on core structure. We find that the core-/final
mass-based prescription favors lower mass remnants, including a large
population of mass gap black holes, and predicts neutron star masses which span
a wide range, whereas the structure-based prescriptions favor slightly higher
mass remnants, mass gap black holes only as low as 3.5 \Msun, and predict

Optimization with respect to the number of vortices yields a tunneling distance
of the order of the coherence length $\xi$, and the train of vortices becomes
equivalent to a quantum phase slip. Based on this theory, we find the

production of gravitational waves that may be observable at upcoming
space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors such as LISA (Laser
Interferometer Space Antenna). As the Standard Model has no phase transition,
LISA can be used to search for new physics by searching for a stochastic
gravitational wave background. In this work we investigate LISA's sensitivity
to the thermodynamic parameters encoded in the stochastic background produced
by a phase transition, using the sound shell model to characterise the
gravitational wave power spectrum, and the Fisher matrix to estimate
uncertainties. We explore a parameter space with transition strengths $\alpha <
0.5$ and phase boundary speeds $0.4 < v_\text{w} < 0.9$, for transitions
nucleating at $T_{\text{N}} = 100$ GeV, with mean bubble spacings $0.1$ and
$0.01$ of the Hubble length, and sound speed $c/\sqrt{3}$. We show that the
power spectrum in the sound shell model can be well approximated by a
four-parameter double broken power law, and find that the peak power and
frequency can be measured to approximately 10% accuracy for signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs) above 20. Determinations of the underlying thermodynamic
parameters are complicated by degeneracies, but in all cases the phase boundary
speed will be the best constrained parameter. Turning to the principal
components of the Fisher matrix, a signal-to-noise ratio above 20 produces a
relative uncertainty less than 3% in the two highest-order principal
components, indicating good prospects for combinations of parameters. The
highest-order principal component is dominated by the wall speed. These
estimates of parameter sensitivity provide a preliminary accuracy target for
theoretical calculations of thermodynamic parameters.

and examining the velocity of galaxies perpendicular to the filament's axis

the viewing angle and the dynamical state of the filament. Just as it is
easiest to measure rotation in a spinning disk galaxy viewed edge on, so too is
filament rotation clearly detected under similar geometric alignment.
Furthermore, the mass of the haloes that sit at either end of the filaments
also increases the spin speed. The more massive the haloes, the more rotation
is detected. These results signify that angular momentum can be generated on

coherences appear to be always beneficial whereas non-passive population
distributions not systematically. Additionally, these energetic gains are
accessible only through non-adiabatic dynamics, contrasting with the usual
optimality of adiabatic dynamics for initial thermal states. Finally, following
frameworks established in the context of shortcut-to-adiabaticity, the

and, in most situations, are found to be smaller than the energetic cost

the ability of the dynamics to consume and use coherences.

  Markets with Asymmetric Balancing Reserve Policies",,,,,"math.OC cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Recently, chance-constrained stochastic electricity market designs have been
proposed to address the shortcomings of scenario-based stochastic market
designs. In particular, the use of chance-constrained market-clearing avoids
trading off in-expectation and per-scenario characteristics and yields unique
energy and reserves prices. However, current formulations rely on symmetric
control policies based on the aggregated system imbalance, which restricts
balancing reserve providers in their energy and reserve commitments. This paper
extends existing chance-constrained market-clearing formulations by leveraging
node-to-node and asymmetric balancing reserve policies and deriving the
resulting energy and reserve prices. The proposed node-to-node policy allows
for relating the remuneration of balancing reserve providers and payment of
uncertain resources using a marginal cost-based approach. Further, we introduce
asymmetric balancing reserve policies into the chance-constrained electricity
market design and show how this additional degree of freedom affects market
outcomes.

core of our approach is the fact that an RL process does not just learn a

increasing its interpretability by a person. Then, to ensure that the rules
explain a valid, non-degenerate policy, we introduce a refinement algorithm

partial differential equation (PDE) tumor growth model that captures mass
effect, parameterized by a single scalar parameter, tumor proliferation,

often improving swarm performance.
  In this work, we use a multi-objective genetic algorithm to evolve response

two-dimensional collective tracking. We show that evolved thresholds not only
outperform uniformly distributed thresholds and dynamic thresholds but achieve
nearly optimal performance on a variety of tracking problem instances (target

several problem instances generalize to all other problem instances eliminating
the need to evolve new thresholds for each problem to be solved. We analyze the

canonical choice of reference frames (gauge). Kernels and features therefore
have to be expressed relative to arbitrary coordinates. We argue that the
particular choice of coordinatization should not affect a network's inference
-- it should be coordinate independent. A simultaneous demand for coordinate
independence and weight sharing is shown to result in a requirement on the
network to be equivariant under local gauge transformations (changes of local
reference frames). The ambiguity of reference frames depends thereby on the
G-structure of the manifold, such that the necessary level of gauge
equivariance is prescribed by the corresponding structure group G. Coordinate
independent convolutions are proven to be equivariant w.r.t. those isometries
that are symmetries of the G-structure. The resulting theory is formulated in a
coordinate free fashion in terms of fiber bundles. To exemplify the design of
coordinate independent convolutions, we implement a convolutional network on
the M\""obius strip. The generality of our differential geometric formulation of
convolutional networks is demonstrated by an extensive literature review which
explains a large number of Euclidean CNNs, spherical CNNs and CNNs on general
surfaces as specific instances of coordinate independent convolutions.

different applications and across verticals is of paramount importance.
However, there are a plethora of IoT platforms using different representations,
protocols and interaction patterns. To address this issue, the Fed4IoT project
has developed an IoT virtualization platform that, on the one hand, integrates
information from many different source platforms and, on the other hand, makes
the information required by the respective users available in the target
platform of choice. To enable this, information is translated into a common,
neutral exchange format. The format of choice is NGSI-LD, which is being
standardized by the ETSI Industry Specification Group on Context Information
Management (ETSI ISG CIM). Thing Visors are the components that translate the
source information to NGSI-LD, which is then delivered to the target platform
and translated into the target format. ThingVisors can be implemented by hand,
but this requires significant human effort, especially considering the
heterogeneity of low level information produced by a multitude of sensors.
Thus, supporting the human developer and, ideally, fully automating the process
of extracting and enriching data and translating it to NGSI-LD is a crucial
step. Machine learning is a promising approach for this, but it typically
requires large amounts of hand-labelled data for training, an effort that makes
it unrealistic in many IoT scenarios. A programmatic labelling approach called
knowledge infusion that encodes expert knowledge is used for matching a schema
or ontology extracted from the data with a target schema or ontology, providing
the basis for annotating the data and facilitating the translation to NGSI-LD.

habitable under non unrealistic circumstances. If a distant, pointlike source
of visible light such as a Sun-like main sequence star or the gravitationally
lensed accretion disk of a supermassive black hole is present as well, possible
temporal variations $\Delta\varepsilon_\mathrm{p}(t)$ of the planet's axial
tilt $\varepsilon_\mathrm{p}$ to the ecliptic plane should be included in the
overall habitability budget since the obliquity determines the insolation at a
given latitude on a body' s surface. I point out that, for rather generic
initial spin-orbit initial configurations, general relativistic and classical
spin variations induced by the post-Newtonian de Sitter and Lense-Thirring
components of the field of the host neutron star and by its pull to the
planetary oblateness $J_2^\mathrm{p}$ may induce huge and very fast variations
of $\varepsilon_\mathrm{p}$ which would likely have an impact on the
habitability of such worlds. In particular, for a planet's distance of, say,
$0.005\,\mathrm{au}$ from a $1.4\,M_\odot$ neutron star corresponding to an
orbital period $P_\mathrm{b}=0.109\,\mathrm{d}$, obliquity shifts
$\Delta\varepsilon_\mathrm{p}$ as large as
$\varepsilon^\mathrm{max}_\mathrm{p}-\varepsilon_\mathrm{p}^\mathrm{min}\simeq
50^\circ-100^\circ$ over characteristic timescales as short as $10\,\mathrm{d}$

practical interest. A simple folklore algorithm can output a 2-approximation to
the diameter in linear time by running BFS from an arbitrary vertex. It has
been open whether a better approximation is possible in near-linear time. A
series of papers on fine-grained complexity have led to strong hardness results
for diameter in directed graphs, culminating in a recent tradeoff curve
independently discovered by [Li, STOC'21] and [Dalirrooyfard and Wein,

any integer $k\ge 2$ and $\delta>0$, a $2-\frac{1}{k}-\delta$ approximation for

perturbing a few pixels (regularized by l_0 norm). Recent efforts combine it
with another l_infty imperceptible on the perturbation magnitudes. The
resultant sparse and imperceptible attacks are practically relevant, and
indicate an even higher vulnerability of DNNs that we usually imagined.
However, such attacks are more challenging to generate due to the optimization
difficulty by coupling the l_0 regularizer and box constraints with a
non-convex objective. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a
homotopy algorithm, to jointly tackle the sparsity and the perturbation bound
in one unified framework. Each iteration, the main step of our algorithm is to
optimize an l_0-regularized adversarial loss, by leveraging the nonmonotone
Accelerated Proximal Gradient Method (nmAPG) for nonconvex programming; it is
followed by an l_0 change control step, and an optional post-attack step
designed to escape bad local minima. We also extend the algorithm to handling
the structural sparsity regularizer. We extensively examine the effectiveness
of our proposed homotopy attack for both targeted and non-targeted attack
scenarios, on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. Compared to state-of-the-art
methods, our homotopy attack leads to significantly fewer perturbations, e.g.,
reducing 42.91% on CIFAR-10 and 75.03% on ImageNet (average case, targeted
attack), at similar maximal perturbation magnitudes, when still achieving 100%
attack success rates. Our codes are available at:

  Carlo Simulations",,,,,"q-fin.CP q-fin.RM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Nested stochastic modeling has been on the rise in many fields of the
financial industry. Such modeling arises whenever certain components of a
stochastic model are stochastically determined by other models. There are at
least two main areas of applications, including (1) portfolio risk management
in the banking sector and (2) principle-based reserving and capital
requirements in the insurance sector. As financial instrument values often
change with economic fundamentals, the risk management of a portfolio (outer
loop) often requires the assessment of financial positions subject to changes
in risk factors in the immediate future. The valuation of financial position
(inner loop) is based on projections of cashflows and risk factors into the
distant future. The nesting of such stochastic modeling can be computationally
challenging.
  Most of existing techniques to speed up nested simulations are based on curve
fitting. The main idea is to establish a functional relationship between inner
loop estimator and risk factors by running a limited set of economic scenarios,
and, instead of running inner loop simulations, inner loop estimations are made
by feeding other scenarios into the fitted curve. This paper presents a
non-conventional approach based on the concept of sample recycling. Its essence
is to run inner loop estimation for a small set of outer loop scenarios and to
find inner loop estimates under other outer loop scenarios by recycling those
known inner loop paths. This new approach can be much more efficient when
traditional techniques are difficult to implement in practice.

the approach addresses fundamental challenges of reproducibility and
generalisability in brain research. These conditions are particularly acute
when studying the developing brain, where our theories based on adult brain
function may fundamentally misrepresent the topography of infant cognition and
where there are substantial practical challenges to data acquisition. Our
methodology employs machine learning to map modulation of a neural feature

fitting a Gaussian process regression along the dataset. We show that our

approximate pattern matching under edit distance. Given an integer $k$, a
pattern $P$ of length $m$, and a text $T$ of length $n \ge m$, the task is to
find substrings of $T$ that are within edit distance $k$ from $P$. Our main
result is a streaming algorithm that solves the problem in $\tilde{O}(k^5)$
space and $\tilde{O}(k^8)$ amortised time per character of the text, providing
answers correct with high probability. (Hereafter, $\tilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides a
$\mathrm{poly}(\log n)$ factor.) This answers a decade-old question: since the
discovery of a $\mathrm{poly}(k\log n)$-space streaming algorithm for pattern
matching under Hamming distance by Porat and Porat [FOCS 2009], the existence
of an analogous result for edit distance remained open. Up to this work, no
$\mathrm{poly}(k\log n)$-space algorithm was known even in the simpler
semi-streaming model, where $T$ comes as a stream but $P$ is available for
read-only access. In this model, we give a deterministic algorithm that
achieves slightly better complexity.
  In order to develop the fully streaming algorithm, we introduce a new edit
distance sketch parametrised by integers $n\ge k$. For any string of length at
most $n$, the sketch is of size $\tilde{O}(k^2)$ and it can be computed with an
$\tilde{O}(k^2)$-space streaming algorithm. Given the sketches of two strings,
in $\tilde{O}(k^3)$ time we can compute their edit distance or certify that it
is larger than $k$. This result improves upon $\tilde{O}(k^8)$-size sketches of
Belazzougui and Zhu [FOCS 2016] and very recent $\tilde{O}(k^3)$-size sketches
of Jin, Nelson, and Wu [STACS 2021].

abstracted as temporal networks. Recently, higher-order patterns that involve
multiple interacting nodes have been found crucial to indicate domain-specific
laws of different temporal networks. This posts us the challenge of designing
more sophisticated hypergraph models for these higher-order patterns and the
associated new learning algorithms. Here, we propose the first model, named
HIT, for full-spectrum higher-order pattern prediction in temporal hypergraphs.
Particularly, we focus on predicting three types of common but important
interaction patterns involving three interacting elements in temporal networks,
which could be extended to even higher-order patterns. HIT extracts the
structural representation of a node triplet of interest on the temporal
hypergraph and uses it to tell what type of, when, and why the interaction
expansion could happen in this triplet. HIT could achieve significant
improvement (averaged 20% AUC gain to identify the interaction type, uniformly
more accurate time estimation) compared to both heuristic and other
neural-network-based baselines on 5 real-world large temporal hypergraphs.
Moreover, HIT provides a certain degree of interpretability by identifying the
most discriminatory structural features on the temporal hypergraphs for
predicting different higher-order patterns.

points (APs) which are distributed over an area. Each AP has an antenna array.
In previous studies, the DAS has been demonstrated great potential to improve
capacity and power efficiency compared to a centralized antenna system (CAS)
which has all the antennas located in one place. The existing research also has
shown that the placement of the APs is essential for the performance of the
DAS. However, most research on AP placement does not take into account
realistic constraints. For instance, they assume that APs can be placed at any
location in a region or the array radiation pattern of each AP is isotropic.
This paper focuses on optimizing the AP placement for the DAS with massive MIMO
(D-mMIMO) in order to reduce the transmit power. A square topology for the AP
placement is applied, which is reasonable for deploying the D-mMIMO in urban
areas while also offering theoretically interesting insights. We investigate
the impact of the radiation pattern, signal coherence, and region size on the
D-mMIMO's performance. Our results suggest that i) among the three factors, the
array radiation pattern of each AP is the most important one in determining the
optimal AP placement for the D-mMIMO; ii) the performance of the D-mMIMO is
highly impacted by the placement and array radiation pattern of each AP, the
D-mMIMO with unoptimized placement may perform even worse than the CAS with
massive MIMO (C-mMIMO); iii) with the consideration of patch antennas and the
mutual coupling effect, the optimized D-mMIMO can potentially save more than 7
dB transmit power compared to the C-mMIMO. Furthermore, our analytical results
also provide an intuition for determining an adequate AP placement for the
D-mMIMO in practice.

Energy-Based Model (EBM) trained with Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) has been
highlighted as a purification model, where an attacked image is purified by
running a long Markov-chain using the gradients of the EBM. Yet, the
practicality of the adversarial purification using an EBM remains questionable
because the number of MCMC steps required for such purification is too large.
In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial purification method based on an
EBM trained with Denoising Score-Matching (DSM). We show that an EBM trained
with DSM can quickly purify attacked images within a few steps. We further
introduce a simple yet effective randomized purification scheme that injects
random noises into images before purification. This process screens the
adversarial perturbations imposed on images by the random noises and brings the
images to the regime where the EBM can denoise well. We show that our
purification method is robust against various attacks and demonstrate its

knowledge of synaptic weights or receptive fields of downstream neurons. This
limits the use of artificial neural networks as a tool for understanding the
biological principles of information processing in the brain. Lillicrap et al.
(2016) propose a more biologically plausible ""feedback alignment"" algorithm
that uses random and fixed backpropagation weights, and show promising
simulations. In this paper we study the mathematical properties of the feedback
alignment procedure by analyzing convergence and alignment for two-layer
networks under squared error loss. In the overparameterized setting, we prove
that the error converges to zero exponentially fast, and also that
regularization is necessary in order for the parameters to become aligned with
the random backpropagation weights. Simulations are given that are consistent
with this analysis and suggest further generalizations. These results
contribute to our understanding of how biologically plausible algorithms might
carry out weight learning in a manner different from Hebbian learning, with
performance that is comparable with the full non-local backpropagation
algorithm.

2-choice balls-into-bins process, where the bins correspond to vertices of an
arbitrary underlying graph $G$. At each time step an edge of $G$ is chosen
uniformly at random, and a ball must be assigned to either of the two endpoints
of this edge. The standard 2-choice process corresponds to the case of $G=K_n$.
  For any $k(n)$-edge-connected, $d(n)$-regular graph on $n$ vertices, and any
number of balls, we give an allocation strategy that, with high probability,
ensures a gap of $O((d/k) \log^4\hspace{-1pt}n \log \log n)$, between the load
of any two bins. In particular, this implies polylogarithmic bounds for natural
graphs such as cycles and tori, for which the classical greedy allocation
strategy is conjectured to have a polynomial gap between the bin loads. For
every graph $G$, we also show an $\Omega((d/k) + \log n)$ lower bound on the
gap achievable by any allocation strategy. This implies that our strategy
achieves the optimal gap, up to polylogarithmic factors, for every graph $G$.
  Our allocation algorithm is simple to implement and requires only
$O(\log(n))$ time per allocation. It can be viewed as a more global version of
the greedy strategy that compares average load on certain fixed sets of
vertices, rather than on individual vertices. A key idea is to relate the
problem of designing a good allocation strategy to that of finding suitable
multi-commodity flows. To this end, we consider R\""{a}cke's cut-based

remains often elusive, since in these materials conventional charge carriers
exist as well. Here, measuring a field-induced length change of the prototype
Weyl semimetal TaAs at low temperatures, we find that its $c$-axis
magnetostriction amounts to relatively large values whereas the $a$-axis
magnetostriction exhibits strong variations with changing the orientation of
the applied magnetic field. It is discovered that at magnetic fields above the
ultra-quantum limit, the magnetostriction of TaAs contains a linear-in-field
term, which, as we show, is a hallmark of the Weyl fermions in a material.
Developing a theory for the magnetostriction of noncentrosymmetric topological
semimetals and applying it to TaAs, we additionally find several parameters
characterizing the interaction between the relativistic fermions and elastic
degrees of freedom in this semimetal. Our study shows how dilatometry can be
used to unveil Weyl fermions in candidate topological semimetals.

of superhuman play in no-limit Texas hold'em poker. Current subgame-solving
techniques analyze the entire common-knowledge closure of the player's current

special regimes such as convex-concave games. Further, it is customarily
assumed that the underlying optimization problem is solved either by a single

wherein each one communicates with a central node. The latter approach becomes
challenging, when the underlying communications network has low bandwidth. In
addition, privacy considerations may dictate that certain nodes can communicate

coordinate system under different IMF conditions. Our high-resolution mapping
enables resolving structures on various scales, ranging from the thin ionopause
and the associated electric currents to the classical global-scale draped IMF.
Our mapping also resolves two recently-reported structures, a low ionospheric
magnetization over the terminator and a global ""looping"" structure in the near
magnetotail, both of which are not depicted in the classical draping
configuration. In contrast to the reported IMF-independent cylindrical magnetic
field of both structures, our results illustrate their IMF dependence. In both

with an upward solar wind electric field ($E^{SW}$) than in the opposite
hemisphere. Under downward $E^{SW}$, the ""looping"" structure even breaks, which
is attributable to an additional draped magnetic field structure wrapping
toward $-E^{SW}$. In addition, our results suggest that these two structures
are spatially not overlapping with each other. The low ionospheric structure
occurs in a very narrow region, at about 87--95$^\circ$ solar zenith angle and

iterations, which implicitly assumes each evaluation has the same cost. In
fact, in many BO applications, evaluation costs vary significantly in different
regions of the search space. In hyperparameter optimization, the time spent on
neural network training increases with layer size; in clinical trials, the
monetary cost of drug compounds vary; and in optimal control, control actions
have differing complexities. Cost-constrained BO measures convergence with
alternative cost metrics such as time, money, or energy, for which the sample
efficiency of standard BO methods is ill-suited. For cost-constrained BO, cost
efficiency is far more important than sample efficiency. In this paper, we
formulate cost-constrained BO as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP),

approximating the kinematic Jacobian, which arises from kinematic equations
mapping a manipulator's joint angles to the end-effector's location. We propose
two different approaches to learn the kinematic Jacobian. The first method
arises from visual servoing where we learn the kinematic Jacobian as an
approximate linear system of equations from the k-nearest neighbors for a
desired joint configuration. The second, motivated by forward models in machine
learning, learns the kinematic behavior directly and calculates the Jacobian by
differentiating the learned neural kinematics model. Simulation experimental
results show that both methods achieve better performance than alternative
data-driven methods for control, provide closer approximations to the proper
kinematics Jacobian matrix, and on average produce better-conditioned Jacobian
matrices. Real-world experiments were conducted on a Kinova Gen-3 lightweight

programs that solve specified computational problems, parent selection is
ordinarily based on aggregate measures of performance across an entire training
set. Lexicase selection, by contrast, selects on the basis of performance on
random sequences of training cases; this has been shown to enhance
problem-solving power in many circumstances. Lexicase selection can also be
seen as better reflecting biological evolution, by modeling sequences of
challenges that organisms face over their lifetimes. Recent work has
demonstrated that the advantages of lexicase selection can be amplified by
down-sampling, meaning that only a random subsample of the training cases is
used each generation. This can be seen as modeling the fact that individual
organisms encounter only subsets of the possible environments, and that
environments change over time. Here we provide the most extensive benchmarking
of down-sampled lexicase selection to date, showing that its benefits hold up
to increased scrutiny. The reasons that down-sampling helps, however, are not
yet fully understood. Hypotheses include that down-sampling allows for more
generations to be processed with the same budget of program evaluations; that
the variation of training data across generations acts as a changing
environment, encouraging adaptation; or that it reduces overfitting, leading to
more general solutions. We systematically evaluate these hypotheses, finding
evidence against all three, and instead draw the conclusion that down-sampled
lexicase selection's main benefit stems from the fact that it allows the
evolutionary process to examine more individuals within the same computational
budget, even though each individual is examined less completely.

result, efficient network compression techniques are often required for the

reinforcement learning-based approach to automate the network compression

light policy gradient method to learn which neurons or channels to be kept or
removed. Each agent in the network has just one parameter (keep or drop) to
learn, which leads to a much faster training process compared to existing
approaches. DECORE provides state-of-the-art compression results on various
network architectures and various datasets. For example, on the ResNet-110
architecture, it achieves a 64.8% compression and 61.8% FLOPs reduction as
compared to the baseline model without any accuracy loss on the CIFAR-10

by up to 99% with just a small accuracy drop of 2.28%. For a larger dataset

other skyrmions by a constant or increasing force in the absence of quenched
disorder. The skyrmion behavior is determined by the ratio of the damping and
Magnus terms, as expressed in terms of the intrinsic skyrmion Hall angle. For a
fixed driving force in the damping dominated regime, the effective viscosity
decreases monotonically with increasing skyrmion density, similar to what is
observed in overdamped systems where it becomes difficult for the driven
particle to traverse the surrounding medium at high densities. In contrast, in
the Magnus dominated regime the velocity dependence on the density is
nonmonotonic, and there is a regime in which the skyrmion moves faster with
increasing density, as well as a pronounced speed-up effect in which a skyrmion
traveling through a dense medium moves more rapidly than it would at low
densities or in the single particle limit. At higher densities, the effective
damping increases and the velocity decreases. The velocity-force curves in the
Magnus-dominated regime show marked differences from those in the
damping-dominated regimes. Under an increasing drive we find that there is a
threshold force for skyrmion motion which increases with density. Additionally,
the skyrmion Hall angle is drive dependent, starting near zero at the threshold
for motion and increasing with increasing drive before reaching a saturation
value, similar to the behavior found for skyrmions driven over quenched
disorder. We map dynamic phase diagrams showing the threshold for motion,
nonlinear flow, speed-up, and saturation regimes. We also find that in some
cases, increasing the density can reduce the skyrmion Hall angle while
producing a velocity boost, which could be valuable for applications.

However, such detection traditionally uses active contour or snake models

high-throughput or real-time situations. Thus, we developed a nonparametric
snake model using an interior point search method applied in iterations to find

iteration, one or more snake points are replaced by others in the edge map. We
validated the model using binary and continuous edge images of single and
multiple objects, and noisy and real images, comparing the results to those
obtained using traditional snake models. The proposed model not only provides
better results on all image types tested but is more robust than traditional
snake models. Unlike traditional snake models, the proposed model requires no
user interaction for initializing snakes and no pre-processing of noisy images.
Thus, our method offers robust automatic image segmentation that is simpler to

when the passive IRS is of a sufficiently large size, for which the
conventional uniform plane wave (UPW)-based channel model may become
inaccurate. In this paper, we pursue a new channel modelling and performance
analysis for wireless communications with extremely large-scale IRS (XL-IRS).
By taking into account the variations in signal's amplitude and projected
aperture across different reflecting elements, we derive both lower- and
upper-bounds of the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the general
uniform planar array (UPA)-based XL-IRS. Our results reveal that, instead of
scaling quadratically with the increased number of reflecting elements M as in
the conventional UPW model, the SNR under the more practically applicable
non-UPW model increases with M only with a diminishing return and gets
saturated eventually. To gain more insights, we further study the special case
of uniform linear array (ULA)-based XL-IRS, for which a closed-form SNR
expression in terms of the IRS size and transmitter/receiver location is
derived. This result shows that the SNR mainly depends on the two geometric
angles formed by the transmitter/receiver locations with the IRS, as well as
the boundary points of the IRS. Numerical results validate our analysis and
demonstrate the importance of proper channel modelling for wireless
communications aided by XL-IRS.

elusive. For example, the behaviour of Si under high pressure, in particular at
the ultra-high strain rates characteristic of dynamic compression, has been a
matter of debate for decades. A detailed understanding of how Si deforms is
crucial for a variety of fields, ranging from planetary science to materials
design. Simulations suggest that in Si the shear stress generated during shock
compression is released inelastically, i.e., via a high-pressure phase
transition, challenging the classical picture of relaxation via defect-mediated
plasticity. However, experiments at the short timescales characteristic of
shock compression are challenging, and direct evidence supporting either
deformation mechanism remain elusive. Here, we use sub-picosecond,
highly-monochromatic x-ray diffraction to study (100)-oriented single-crystal
Si under laser-driven shock compression. We provide the first unambiguous,
time-resolved picture of Si deformation at ultra-high strain rates,
demonstrating the predicted inelastic shear release. Our results resolve the

  Previous work, i.e., code2seq has used structural information from Abstract

edit classification on two datasets of fine-grained syntactic edits.
  Our experiments shows that attempts of adding syntactic structure does not

that techniques such as code2seq, while promising, have a long way to go before
they can be generically applied to learning code edit representations. We hope
that these results will benefit other researchers and inspire them to work

between neighboring swimmers we seek to study how contact forces and spatial
configurations are governed by the phase difference between neighboring
swimmers. We find that undulatory actuation in close proximity drives
neighboring swimmers into spatial equilibrium configurations that depend on the
actuation phase difference. We propose a model for spatial equilibrium of
nearest neighbor undulatory swimmers which we call the gait compatibility
condition, which is the set of spatial and gait configurations in which no
collisions occur. Robotic experiments with two, three, and four swimmers
exhibit good agreement with the compatibility model. To probe the interaction
potential between undulatory swimmers we perturb the each longitudinally from
their equilibrium configurations and we measure their steady-state
displacement. These studies reveal that undulatory swimmers in close proximity
exhibit cohesive longitudinal interaction forces that drive the swimmers from
incompatible to compatible configurations. This system of undulatory swimmers
provides new insight into active-matter systems which move through body
undulation. In addition to the importance of velocity and orientation coherence
in active-matter swarms, we demonstrate that undulatory phase coherence is also
important for generating stable, cohesive group configurations.

different flow regimes were identified as a function of the particle Reynolds
number. For low particle Reynolds numbers ($20 < Re_p < 40$), the porosity is
relatively low and the particle dynamics are dominated by interparticle
collisions that produce anisotropic particle velocity fluctuations. The
relative importance of hydrodynamic effects increases with increasing particle
Reynolds number, leading to a minimized anisotropy in the particle velocity
fluctuations at an intermediate particle Reynolds number. For high particle
Reynolds numbers ($Re_p > 40$), the particle dynamics are dominated by
hydrodynamic effects, leading to decreasing and more anisotropic particle
velocity fluctuations. A sharp increase in the anisotropy occurs when the
particle Reynolds number increases from 40 to 50, corresponding to a transition
from a regime in which collision and hydrodynamic effects are equally important

optimum particle Reynolds number of roughly 40 for the investigated Archimedes

data distribution is a subpopulation of the training distribution. For such
settings, a line of recent work has proposed the use of a variant of empirical
risk minimization(ERM) known as distributionally robust optimization (DRO). In
this work, we apply DRO to real, large-scale tasks with subpopulation shift,
and observe that DRO performs relatively poorly, and moreover has severe
instability. We identify one direct cause of this phenomenon: sensitivity of
DRO to outliers in the datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose the
framework of DORO, for Distributional and Outlier Robust Optimization. At the
core of this approach is a refined risk function which prevents DRO from
overfitting to potential outliers. We instantiate DORO for the Cressie-Read
family of R\'enyi divergence, and delve into two specific instances of this
family: CVaR and $\chi^2$-DRO. We theoretically prove the effectiveness of the
proposed method, and empirically show that DORO improves the performance and
stability of DRO with experiments on large modern datasets, thereby positively
addressing the open question raised by Hashimoto et al., 2018.

the complex systems into linear model to facilitate the training on small

consumption estimation of most chillers can be physically viewed as an
input-output monotonic problem. Thus, we can design a Neural Network with
monotonic constraints to mimic the physical behavior of the system. We verify
the proposed method in a cooling system of a data center, experimental results

The third-order MBE(3) expansion of OSV-MP2 wavefunction was developed to adopt
the orbital-specific clustering and long-range termination schemes, which
avoids term-by-term differentiations of the MBE energy bodies. We achieve
better efficiency by exploiting the algorithmic sparsity that allows to prune
out insignificant fitting integrals and OSV relaxations. With these
approximations, the present implementation is benchmarked on a range of
molecules that show an economic scaling in the linear and quadratic regimes for
computing MBE(3)-OSV-MP2 amplitude and gradient equations, respectively, and
yields normal accuracy comparable to the original OSV-MP2 results. The
MPI-3-based parallelism through shared memory one-sided communication is
further developed for improving parallel scalability and memory accessibility

challenge. Despite a number of sampling-based methods have been proposed to
enable mini-batch training on large graphs, these methods have not been proved
to work on truly industry-scale graphs, which require GPUs or mixed-CPU-GPU
training. The state-of-the-art sampling-based methods are usually not optimized
for these real-world hardware setups, in which data movement between CPUs and
GPUs is a bottleneck. To address this issue, we propose Global Neighborhood
Sampling that aims at training GNNs on giant graphs specifically for
mixed-CPU-GPU training. The algorithm samples a global cache of nodes
periodically for all mini-batches and stores them in GPUs. This global cache
allows in-GPU importance sampling of mini-batches, which drastically reduces
the number of nodes in a mini-batch, especially in the input layer, to reduce
data copy between CPU and GPU and mini-batch computation without compromising
the training convergence rate or model accuracy. We provide a highly efficient
implementation of this method and show that our implementation outperforms an
efficient node-wise neighbor sampling baseline by a factor of 2X-4X on giant

As one of the methods to meet these requirements, we focus on a binary
classification model that is developed by using not only normal data but also
outlier data in the other domains as pseudo-anomalous sound data, which can be
easily updated by using anomalous data. In this paper, we implement a new loss
function based on metric learning to learn the distance relationship from each

proposed multi-task learning of the binary classification and the metric
learning makes it possible to build the feature space where the within-class
variance is minimized and the between-class variance is maximized while keeping
normal and anomalous classes linearly separable. We also investigate the
effectiveness of additionally using anomalous sound data for further improving
the binary classification model. Our results showed that multi-task learning
using binary classification and metric learning to consider the distance from

significantly improved by using even a small amount of anomalous data during

several candidate labels but only one is the true label (TL). In PLL,
identification-based strategy (IBS) purifies each PL on the fly to select the
(most likely) TL for training; average-based strategy (ABS) treats all
candidate labels equally for training and let trained models be able to predict
TL. Although PLL research has focused on IBS for better performance, ABS is
also worthy of study since modern IBS behaves like ABS in the beginning of
training to prepare for PL purification and TL selection. In this paper, we
analyze why ABS was unsatisfactory and propose how to improve it.
Theoretically, we formalize five problem settings of PLL and prove that average
PL losses (APLLs) with bounded multi-class losses are always robust, while
APLLs with unbounded losses may be non-robust, which is the first robustness

improve upon itself. Our work draws attention to ABS research, which can in

slowly when fitting noise (which indicates better stability). Concretely, we
decompose the excess risk dynamics and apply the stability-based bound only on

recognition. Recently, deep clustering methods (algorithms based on deep
learning) have attracted wide attention with their impressive performance. Most
of these algorithms combine deep unsupervised representation learning and
standard clustering together. However, the separation of representation
learning and clustering will lead to suboptimal solutions because the two-stage
strategy prevents representation learning from adapting to subsequent tasks
(e.g., clustering according to specific cues). To overcome this issue, efforts
have been made in the dynamic adaption of representation and cluster
assignment, whereas current state-of-the-art methods suffer from heuristically
constructed objectives with representation and cluster assignment alternatively
optimized. To further standardize the clustering problem, we audaciously
formulate the objective of clustering as finding a precise feature as the cue
for cluster assignment. Based on this, we propose a general-purpose deep
clustering framework which radically integrates representation learning and
clustering into a single pipeline for the first time. The proposed framework
exploits the powerful ability of recently developed generative models for
learning intrinsic features, and imposes an entropy minimization on the
distribution of the cluster assignment by a dedicated variational algorithm.
Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method is

such as the method of Fisher-Yates, are not well suited to implementation on
GPUs due to inherent sequential dependencies, and existing parallel shuffling
algorithms are unsuitable for GPU architectures because they incur a large
number of read/write operations to high latency global memory. To address this,
we provide a method of generating pseudo-random permutations in parallel by
fusing suitable pseudo-random bijective functions with stream compaction
operations. Our algorithm, termed `bijective shuffle' trades increased
per-thread arithmetic operations for reduced global memory transactions. It is
work-efficient, deterministic, and only requires a single global memory read
and write per shuffle input, thus maximising use of global memory bandwidth. To
empirically demonstrate the correctness of the algorithm, we develop a
statistical test for the quality of pseudo-random permutations based on kernel
space embeddings. Experimental results show that the bijective shuffle
algorithm outperforms competing algorithms on GPUs, showing improvements of
between one and two orders of magnitude and approaching peak device bandwidth.

due to its powerful generalizability through effectively leveraging large-scale
unlabeled data. There are two prevalent approaches for this, contrastive
learning and generative pre-training, where the former learns representations
from instance-wise discrimination tasks and the latter learns them from
estimating the likelihood. These seemingly orthogonal approaches have their own
strengths and weaknesses. Contrastive learning tends to extract semantic
information and discards details irrelevant for classifying objects, making the
representations effective for discriminative tasks while degrading robustness
to out-of-distribution data. On the other hand, the generative pre-training
directly estimates the data distribution, so the representations tend to be
robust but not optimal for discriminative tasks. In this paper, we show that we
could achieve the best of both worlds by a hybrid training scheme.
Specifically, we demonstrated that a transformer-based encoder-decoder
architecture trained with both contrastive and generative losses can learn
highly discriminative and robust representations without hurting the generative
performance. We extensively validate our approach on various tasks.

paper we use multifractal analysis to evaluate if the temporal dynamics of
market returns also exhibits calendar anomalies such as day-of-the-week
effects. We apply the multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) to
daily returns of market indices around the world for each day of the week. Our
results indicate that individual days of the week are characterized by distinct
multifractal properties. Monday returns tend to exhibit more persistent
behavior and richer multifractal structures than other day-resolved returns.
Shuffling the series reveals that multifractality arises both from a broad
probability density function and from long-term correlations. From the
time-dependent multifractal analysis we find that multifractal spectra for
Monday returns are much wider than for other days during periods of financial
crises. The presence of day-of-the-week effects in multifractal dynamics of
market returns motivates further research on calendar anomalies from an

implement are essential. One such area of concern is the rising number of
accidents happening due to gas leaks at coal mines, chemical industries, home
appliances etc. In this paper we propose a novel approach to detect and
identify the gaseous emissions using the multimodal AI fusion techniques. Most
of the gases and their fumes are colorless, odorless, and tasteless, thereby
challenging our normal human senses. Sensing based on a single sensor may not
be accurate, and sensor fusion is essential for robust and reliable detection
in several real-world applications. We manually collected 6400 gas samples
(1600 samples per class for four classes) using two specific sensors: the
7-semiconductor gas sensors array, and a thermal camera. The early fusion
method of multimodal AI, is applied The network architecture consists of a
feature extraction module for individual modality, which is then fused using a
merged layer followed by a dense layer, which provides a single output for
identifying the gas. We obtained the testing accuracy of 96% (for fused model)
as opposed to individual model accuracies of 82% (based on Gas Sensor data
using LSTM) and 93% (based on thermal images data using CNN model). Results
demonstrate that the fusion of multiple sensors and modalities outperforms the
outcome of a single sensor.

subject to the steady state physics of three-phase power grids with
nonnegligible phase unbalance. Significant progress on this problem has been
made on the mathematical modelling side of unbalanced OPF, however there is a
lack of information on implementation aspects as well as data sets for
benchmarking. One of the key problems is the lack of definitions of current and
voltage bounds across different classes of representations of the power flow
equations. Therefore, this tutorial-style paper summarizes the structural
features of the unbalanced (optimal) power problem for three-phase systems. The
resulting nonlinear complex-value matrix formulations are presented for both
the bus injection and branch flow formulation frameworks, which typically
cannot be implemented as-is in optimization toolboxes. Therefore, this paper
also derives the equivalent real-value formulations, and discusses challenges
related to the implementation in optimization modeling toolboxes. The derived
formulations can be re-used easily for continuous and discrete optimization
problems in distribution networks for a variety of operational and planning
problems. Finally, bounds are derived for all variables involved, to further
the development of benchmarks for unbalanced optimal power flow, where
consensus on bound semantics is a pressing need. We believe benchmarks remain a
cornerstone for the development and validation of scalable and reproducible
optimization models and tools. The soundness of the derivations is confirmed
through numerical experiments, validated w.r.t. OpenDSS for IEEE test feeders

establish and maintain inter-plane ISLs, which support communication between
different orbital planes. This is due to the fast movement of the
infrastructure and to the limited computation and communication capabilities on
the satellites. In this paper, we make use of antenna arrays with either Butler
matrix beam switching networks or digital beam steering to establish the
inter-plane ISLs in a LEO satellite constellation. Furthermore, we present a
greedy matching algorithm to establish inter-plane ISLs with the objective of
maximizing the sum of rates. This is achieved by sequentially selecting the
pairs, switching or pointing the beams and, finally, setting the data rates.
Our results show that, by selecting an update period of 30 seconds for the
matching, reliable communication can be achieved throughout the constellation,
where the impact of interference in the rates is less than 0.7 % when compared
to orthogonal links, even for relatively small antenna arrays. Furthermore,
doubling the number of antenna elements increases the rates by around one order
of magnitude.

study the phase transitions of FePS$_3$ using first-principles methods based on

that the Mott transition in FePS$_3$ can be orbital-selective, with $t_{2g}$
states undergoing a correlation-induced insulator-to-metal transition while
$e_g$ states remain gapped. We show that this orbital-selective Mott phase,
which occurs only when non-hydrostatic pressure is used, is a bad metal (or
non-Fermi liquid) with large fluctuating moments due to Hund's coupling.
Further application of pressure increases the crystal-field splitting and
converts the system to a conventional Fermi liquid with low-spin configurations
dominant. Our results show that FePS$_3$ is a novel example of a system that
realizes an orbital-selective Mott phase, allowing tuning between correlated

distribution (CV-QKD). As the most commonly used reconciliation protocol in
short-distance CV-QKD, the slice error correction (SEC) allows a system to
distill more than 1 bit from each pulse. However, its quantization efficiency
is greatly affected by the noisy channel with a low signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR), which usually limits the secure distance to about 30 km. In this paper,
an improved SEC protocol, named Rotation-based SEC (RSEC), is proposed through
performing a random orthogonal rotation on the raw data before quantization,
and deducing a new estimator for quantized sequences. Moreover, the RSEC
protocol is implemented with polar codes. Experimental results show that the
proposed protocol can reach up to a quantization efficiency of about 99\%, and
maintains at around 96\% even at the relatively low SNRs $(0.5,1)$, which
theoretically extends the secure distance to about 45 km. When implemented with
the polar codes with block length of 16 Mb, the RSEC can achieve a
reconciliation efficiency of above 95\%, which outperforms all previous SEC
schemes. In terms of finite-size effects, we achieve a secret key rate of
$7.83\times10^{-3}$ bits/pulse at a distance of 33.93 km (the corresponding SNR
value is 1). These results indicate that the proposed protocol significantly
improves the performance of SEC and is a competitive reconciliation scheme for
the CV-QKD system.

combined together only as the last step of the signal evaluation procedure.

is not a solution for CS gravity. At the same time, the only rotating solution
available in the literature for dynamical CS (dCS) gravity is the slow-rotating

slow-rotating case (accurate to first order in spin), we derive the linear
perturbation equations governing the metric and the dCS field accurate to
linear order in spin and quadratic order in the CS coupling parameter
($\alpha$) and obtain the quasi-normal mode (QNM) frequencies. After confirming
the recent results of Wagle et al. (2021), we find an additional contribution
to the eigenfrequency correction at the leading perturbative order of
$\alpha^2$. Unlike Wagle et al., we also find corrections to frequencies in the
polar sector. We compute these extra corrections by evaluating the expectation
values of the perturbative potential on unperturbed QNM wavefunctions along a
contour deformed into the complex-$r$ plane. For $\alpha=0.1 M^2$, we obtain
the ratio of the imaginary parts of the dCS correction to the GR correction in
the first QNM frequency (in the polar sector) to be $0.263$ implying
significant change. For the $(2,2)-$mode, the dCS corrections make the
imaginary part of the first QNM of the fundamental mode less negative, thereby
decreasing the decay rate. Our results, along with future gravitational wave
observations, can be used to test for dCS gravity and further constrain the CS

two peaks have been observed in the initial phase of emission, where one peak
is found to be constant while other one as varying, i.e., non-constant

suggests the rotational motion of surge plasma. The heated base and rotating
plasma suggests the occurrence of magnetic reconnection, most likely, as the

carefully making a competition and cooperation trade-off among agents, we can
reach an equilibrium state that guarantees not only individual advertiser's

avoid the potential collusion behaviors of bidding low prices underlying the
cooperation, we further propose bar agents to set a personalized bidding bar
for each agent, and then alleviate the revenue degradation due to the
cooperation. Third, to deploy MAAB in the large-scale advertising system with
millions of advertisers, we propose a mean-field approach. By grouping
advertisers with the same objective as a mean auto-bidding agent, the
interactions among the large-scale advertisers are greatly simplified, making
it practical to train MAAB efficiently. Extensive experiments on the offline
industrial dataset and Alibaba advertising platform demonstrate that our
approach outperforms several baseline methods in terms of social welfare and

reformulate semantic parsing as a constrained paraphrasing problem: given an
utterance, our model synchronously generates its canonical utterance and
meaning representation. During synchronous decoding: the utterance paraphrasing
is constrained by the structure of the logical form, therefore the canonical

Instead of focusing on the unfavourable aspects, we find it critical for RL to
ease the gap between the estimated data distribution and the ground truth data

unperturbed disks in single star systems. However, it is possible that giant
planets could have already formed when other planetary embryos start to grow.
We investigate the dynamics of planetesimals under the perturbation of a giant
planet in a gaseous disk. Our aim is to understand the effect of the planet's
perturbation on the formation of giant planet cores outside the orbit of the
planet. We calculate the orbital evolution of planetesimals ranging from
$10^{13}$ to $10^{20}$g, with a Jupiter-mass planet located at 5.2 au. We find
orbital alignment of planetesimals distributed in $\simeq 9$-15 au, except for
the mean motion resonance (MMR) locations. The degree of alignment increases
with increasing distance from the planet and decreasing planetesimal mass.
Aligned orbits lead to low encounter velocity and thus faster growth. The
typical velocity dispersion for identical-mass planetesimals is $\sim
\mathcal{O}(10)$ $\rm{m\text{ } s}^{-1}$ except for the MMR locations. The
relative velocity decreases with increasing distance from the planet and
decreasing mass ratio of planetesimals. When the eccentricity vectors of
planetesimals reach equilibrium under the gas drag and secular perturbation,
the relative velocity becomes lower when the masses of two planetesimals are
both on the larger end of the mass spectrum. Our results show that with a giant
planet embedded in the disk, the growth of another planetary core outside the
planet orbit might be accelerated in certain locations.

we approach this problem in a generalized setting, by considering approximate

what is the minimum Hamming distance between $w$ and any word $u$ obtained by

This work discusses an experimental method inspired by quantum logic techniques

The method allows for sympathetic cooling of the (anti-)proton to its
quantum-mechanical ground state as well as the readout of its spin alignment,
replacing the commonly used continuous Stern-Gerlach effect. Both of these
features are achieved through coupling to a laser-cooled `logic' ion co-trapped
in a double-well potential. This technique will boost the measurement sampling
rate and will thus provide results with lower statistical uncertainty,
contributing to stringent searches for time dependent variations in the data.
Such measurements ultimately yield extremely high sensitivities to CPT
violating coefficients acting on baryons in the Standard-Model Extension, will
allow the exploration of previously unmeasured types of symmetry violations,
and will enable antimatter-based axion-like dark matter searches with improved
mass resolution.

Assuming a broken power-law electron population, we calculated the broadband

found that such anisotropic flow can reproduce blazars broadband emission as

explain the evolution of the halo density profile related to SIDM models.
Furthermore, we investigate the encounter condition of PBHs that may have been
randomly distributed in the medium of dark matter halos. Under these
assumptions, we calculate the merger rate of PBHs within each halo considering
SIDM halo models and compare the results with that obtained for cold dark
matter (CDM) halo models. To do this, we employ the definition of the time

models for $f_{\rm PBH}>0.32$ can generate sufficient PBH mergers in such a way
that those exceed the one resulted from CDM halo models. By considering the
spherical-collapse halo mass function, we obtain similar results for the
cumulative merger rate of PBHs. Moreover, we calculate the redshift evolution
of the PBH total merger rate. To determine a constraint on the PBH abundance,
we study the merger rate of PBHs in terms of their fraction and masses and
compare those with the black hole merger rate estimated by the Advanced LIGO
(aLIGO)-Advanced Virgo (aVirgo) detectors during the third observing run. The
results demonstrate that within the context of SIDM halo models, the merger
rate of $10~M_{\odot}-10~M_{\odot}$ events can potentially fall within the
aLIGO-aVirgo window. We also estimate a relation between the fraction of PBHs

active galactic nuclei, exhibit a wind outflow, when they reveal a multicolor
blackbody spectrum, hence harboring a geometrically thin Keplerian accretion
disk. Unlike an advective disk, in the thin disk, the physical environment,
like, emission line, external heating, is expected to play a key role to drive
the wind outflow. We show the wind outflow in a thin disk attributing a disk
irradiation effect, probably from the inner to outer disks. We solve the set of
steady, axisymmetric disk model equations in cylindrical coordinates along the
vertical direction for a given launching radius $(r)$ from the midplane,
introducing irradiation as a parameter. We obtain an acceleration solution, for
a finite irradiation in the presence of a fixed but tiny initial vertical
velocity (hence thin disk properties practically do not alter) at the midplane,
upto a maximum height ($z^{max}$). We find that wind outflow mainly occurs from
the outer region of the disk and its density decreases with increasing
launching radius, and for a given launching radius with increasing ejection
height. Wind power decreases with increasing ejection height. For $z^{max} <
2r$, wind outflow is ejected tangentially (or parallel to the disk midplane) in
all directions with the fluid speed same as the azimuthal speed. This confirms
mainly, for low mass X-ray binaries, (a) wind outflow should be preferentially
observed in high-inclination sources, (b) the expectation of red and blue

$\boldsymbol{X}(t)$, of an It\^o stochastic differential equation (SDE) with

particular, we assume an explicit numerical scheme for the generation of sample

of $\hat{\boldsymbol{X}}(t_n)$ as a function of the initial condition

numerical solution into a ""central part"" and an ""effective noise"" term. The
central term is computed deterministically from the ordinary differential
equation (ODE) that results from eliminating the diffusion term in the SDE,
while the effective noise accounts for the stochastic deviation from the
numerical solution of the ODE. For simplicity, we describe algorithms based on
an Euler-Maruyama integrator, but other explicit numerical schemes can be
exploited in the same way. We also apply the moment approximations to construct
estimates of the 1-dimensional marginal probability density functions of
$\hat{\boldsymbol{X}}(t_n)$ based on a Gram-Charlier expansion. Both for the
approximation of moments and 1-dimensional densities, we describe how to handle
the cases in which the initial condition is fixed (i.e., $\boldsymbol{X}_0 =
\boldsymbol{x}_0$ for some known $\boldsymbol{x_0}$) or random. In the latter
case, we resort to polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) schemes to approximate the
target moments. The methodology has been inspired by the PCE and differential

levels unreachable by classical computation. Quantum walks are heading the
development of quantum algorithms for searching information on graphs more
efficiently than their classical counterparts. A quantum-walk-based algorithm
standing out in the literature is the lackadaisical quantum walk. The
lackadaisical quantum walk is an algorithm developed to search graph structures
whose vertices have a self-loop of weight $l$. This paper addresses several
issues related to applying the lackadaisical quantum walk to search for
multiple solutions on grids successfully. Firstly, we show that only one of the
two stopping conditions found in the literature is suitable for simulations. We
also demonstrate that the final success probability depends on both the space
density of solutions and the relative distance between solutions. Furthermore,
this work generalizes the lackadaisical quantum walk to search for multiple
solutions on grids of arbitrary dimensions. In addition, we propose an optimal
adjustment of the self-loop weight $l$ for such $d$-dimensional grids. It turns
out other fits of $l$ found in the literature are particular cases. Finally, we
observe a two-to-one relation between the steps of the lackadaisical quantum
walk and Grover's algorithm, which requires modifications in the stopping
condition. In conclusion, this work deals with practical issues one should
consider when applying the lackadaisical quantum walk, besides expanding the
technique to a broader range of search problems.

In this range, with decreasing temperature, the equilibrium wet fraction
increases continuously from zero to one. Also, the statistical properties of

atmospheric residuals and instrumental aberrations. When introducing artificial
static wavefront aberrations on the DM, we find that LDFC can improve the raw

residual wavefront error decreased by $\sim$50 nm RMS, from $\sim$90 nm to

  cannibalization effect under high market penetration",,,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The market revenue for variable renewable electricity (VRE) assets has been
under intense scrutiny during the last few years. The observation that wind and
solar power depress market prices at times when they produce the most has been
termed the 'cannibalization effect'. This can have a substantial impact on the
revenue of these technologies, the magnitude of which has already been
established within the economic literature on current and future markets. Yet,
the effect is neglected in the capital budgeting literature assessing green
investments in the electricity sector (e.g. including methods such as
portfolio- and real-options theory). In this paper, we present an analytical
framework that explicitly models the correlation between VRE production and
electricity price, as well as the impact on revenues of the surrounding
capacity mix and cost to emit CO$_2$. In particular, we derive closed-form
expressions for the short-term and long-term expected revenue, the variance of
the revenue and the timing of investments. The effect of including these system
characteristics is illustrated with numerical examples, using a wind investment
in the Polish electricity system as a test case. We find the cannibalization
effect to have major influence on the revenues, making the projected profit of
a project decrease from 33% to between 13% and -40% (i.e. a loss), depending on
the assumption for the rate of future VRE capacity expansion. Using a real
options framework, the investment threshold increases by between 13% and 67%,
due to the inclusion of cannibalization. Our results likewise indicate that
subjective beliefs and uncertainty about the future electricity capacity mix,
e.g.\ VRE capacity growth, significantly affect the assessment of the revenue
and investment timing.

Suzuki. In this paper, we focus on a logarithmic derivative lies between the
symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) and the right logarithmic derivative

heavily deteriorate when directly applied to data from later years. Then, we
investigate two possible sources of the deterioration: the semantic shift of
existing tokens and the sub-optimal or failed understanding of new tokens. To
this end, we both explore two different vocabulary composition methods, as well

pairs, which leads to a rapidly increasing false alarm probability. We show how
knowledge of the expected galaxy lensing time delays in our searches allow us
to tackle this problem. Once the time delays are included, the false alarm
probability increases linearly (similar to non-lensed searches) instead of
quadratically with time, significantly improving the search. For galaxy cluster
lenses, the improvement is less significant. The main uncertainty associated

the $k$-sparse unit vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$. The model captures both sparse
PCA (in its Wigner form) and tensor PCA.
  For the highly sparse regime of $k \leq \sqrt{n}$, we present a family of

recover the sparse vectors for $\lambda \geq \tilde{\mathcal{O}}(k \cdot r)$

the most paradigmatic spin models, taking an important role in statistical and
condensed matter physics to understand magnetism. Still, despite its
paradigmatic character and the widely accepted ban of a (continuous)
spontaneous symmetry breaking, controversies remain whether the model exhibits
a phase transition at finite temperature. Importantly, the model can be
interpreted as a lattice discretization of the $O(3)$ non-linear sigma model in
$1+1$ dimensions, one of the simplest quantum field theories encompassing
crucial features of celebrated higher-dimensional ones (like quantum
chromodynamics in $3+1$ dimensions), namely the phenomenon of asymptotic
freedom. This should also exclude finite-temperature transitions, but lattice
effects might play a significant role in correcting the mainstream picture. In
this work, we make use of state-of-the-art tensor network approaches,
representing the classical partition function in the thermodynamic limit over a
large range of temperatures, to comprehensively explore the correlation
structure for Gibbs states. By implementing an $SU(2)$ symmetry in our
two-dimensional tensor network contraction scheme, we are able to handle very
large effective bond dimensions of the environment up to $\chi_E^\text{eff}
\sim 1500$, a feature that is crucial in detecting phase transitions. With
decreasing temperatures, we find a rapidly diverging correlation length, whose
behaviour is apparently compatible with the two main contradictory hypotheses
known in the literature, namely a finite-$T$ transition and asymptotic freedom,
though with a slight preference for the second.

making this the most comprehensive search for ram pressure stripping in groups
to date. We identify 60 jellyfish galaxies in groups with extended, asymmetric
radio continuum tails, which are found across the entire range of group mass
from $10^{12.5} < M_\mathrm{group} < 10^{14}\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$. We
compare the group jellyfish galaxies identified in this work with the LoTSS
jellyfish galaxies in clusters presented in Roberts et al. (2021), allowing us
to compare the effects of ram pressure stripping across three decades in
group/cluster mass. We find that jellyfish galaxies are most commonly found in
clusters, with the frequency decreasing towards the lowest mass groups. Both
the orientation of observed radio continuum tails, and the positions of group
jellyfish galaxies in phase space, suggest that galaxies are stripped more
slowly in groups relative to clusters. Finally, we find that the star formation
rates of jellyfish galaxies in groups are consistent with `normal' star-forming
group galaxies, which is in contrast to cluster jellyfish galaxies that have
clearly enhanced star formation rates. On the whole, there is clear evidence
for ongoing ram pressure stripping in galaxy groups (down to very low group
masses), though the frequency of jellyfish galaxies and the strength of ram
pressure stripping appears smaller in groups than clusters. Differences in the
efficiency of ram pressure stripping in groups versus clusters likely
contributes to the positive trend between quenched fraction and host halo mass

trained with accessible labeled data in the source domain (SD) and few labeled

Thus, the private information will be leaked if we directly access data in SD

to thoroughly prevent the privacy leakage in SD, we consider a very challenging

longitudinal oscillatory motions that are strongly attenuated with time. The
damping mechanism responsible for the reported oscillations is not fully
understood yet. To understand the oscillations and damping of prominence
threads it is mandatory to investigate first the nature of the equilibrium
solutions that arise under static conditions and under the presence of
radiative losses, thermal conduction and background heating. This provides the
basis to calculate the eigenmodes of the thread models. The nonlinear ordinary
differential equations for hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium under the
presence of gravity are solved using standard numerical techniques and simple
analytical expressions are derived under certain approximations. The solutions
to the equations represent a prominence thread, i.e., a dense and cold plasma
region of a certain length that connects with the corona through a prominence
corona transition region (PCTR). The solutions can also match with a
chromospheric-like layer if a spatially dependent heating function localised
around the footpoints is considered. We have obtained static solutions
representing prominence threads and have investigated in detail the dependence
of these solutions on the different parameters of the model. Among other
results, we have shown that multiple condensations along a magnetic field line
are possible, and that the effect of partial ionisation in the model can
significantly modify the thermal balance in the thread and therefore their
length. This last parameter is also shown to be comparable to that reported in
the observations when the radiative losses are reduced for typical thread
temperatures.

access the original secret state; any dishonest unauthorised conspiracy cannot
reconstruct it. We analyse a QSS protocol involving three untrusted players and
demonstrate that quantum steering is the required resource which enables the

share any single-mode Gaussian secret which enables the states to be shared
with the optimal use of resources.

Alternating minimization (AM) is standard for the underlying optimization,
where gradient descent steps alternate with sparse coding procedures. The major
drawback of this method is its prohibitive computational cost, making it
unpractical on large real-world data sets. This work studies an approximate
formulation of dictionary learning based on unrolling and compares it to
alternating minimization to find the best trade-off between speed and

we apply unrolling on pattern learning in magnetoencephalography (MEG) with the

preserve attributes like facial expression and gaze direction, our framework is
capable of transferring the identity of an arbitrary source face into an
arbitrary target face while preserving the attributes of the target face. We
overcome the above defects in the following two ways. First, we present the ID
Injection Module (IIM) which transfers the identity information of the source
face into the target face at feature level. By using this module, we extend the
architecture of an identity-specific face swapping algorithm to a framework for
arbitrary face swapping. Second, we propose the Weak Feature Matching Loss
which efficiently helps our framework to preserve the facial attributes in an
implicit way. Extensive experiments on wild faces demonstrate that our SimSwap
is able to achieve competitive identity performance while preserving attributes
better than previous state-of-the-art methods. The code is already available on

theoretical works studied the performance of quantum algorithms for models with

example, we consider a 3-XORSAT model defined on simple hypergraphs. The
degeneracy of classical ground state manifold translates into the emergence of
an extensive number of $Z_2$ symmetries, which remain intact even in the
presence of a quantum transverse magnetic field. We establish a general duality
approach that restricts the quantum problem to a given sector of conserved
$Z_2$ charges and use it to study how the outcome of the quantum adiabatic
algorithm depends on the hypergraph geometry. We show that the tree hypergraph

second-order phase transition with a gap vanishing as a power-law in the

studies of quantum models with classically degenerate energy manifold and

occur sequentially. Classically, the robustness is calculated for a given
network, from the simulation of a large number of extinction sequences. The
link between network structure and robustness remains an open question. Setting
a joint probabilistic model on the network and the extinction sequences allows
analysis of this relation.
  Bipartite stochastic block models have proven their ability to model
bipartite networks e.g. plant-pollinator networks: species are divided into
blocks and interaction probabilities are determined by the blocks of
membership. Analytical expressions of the expectation and variance of

$t$. The problems we study are of strictly hyperbolic type with respect to a
generic weight and a metric on the phase space. The singular behavior is
captured by the blow-up of the first and second $t$-derivatives of the
coefficients which allows the coefficients to be either logarithmic-type or
oscillatory-type near $t=0$. To arrive at an energy estimate, we perform a
conjugation by a pseudodifferential operator of the form
$e^{\nu(t)\Theta(x,D_x)},$ where $\Theta(x,D_x)$ explains the quantity of the
loss by linking it to the metric on the phase space and the singular behavior
while $\nu(t)$ gives a scale for the loss. We call the conjugating operator as
{\itshape{loss operator}} and depending on its order we report that the
solution experiences zero, arbitrarily small, finite or infinite loss in
relation to the initial datum. We also provide a counterexample and derive the

  dispersion forces between chiral molecules","21 pages, 2 figures",,"10.1063/5.0090266",,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Dispersion interactions are one of the components of van der Waals (vdW)
forces, which play a key role in the understanding of intermolecular
interactions in many physical, chemical and biological processes. The theory of
dispersion forces was developed by London in the early years of quantum
mechanics. However, it was only in the 1960s that it was recognized that for
molecules lacking an inversion center such as chiral and helical molecules,
there are chirality-sensitive corrections to the dispersion forces proportional
to the rotatory power known from the theory of circular dichroism and with the
same distance scaling law R-6 as the London energy. The discovery of the
Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) effect in recent years has led to an
additional twist in the study of chiral molecular systems, showing a close
relation between spin and molecular geometry. Motivated by it, we propose in
this investigation to describe the mutual induction of charge and spin-density
fluctuations in a pair A-B of chiral molecules by a simple physical model. The
model assumes that the same fluctuating electric fields responsible for vdW
forces can induce a magnetic response via a Rashba-like term, so that an
spin-orbit field acting on molecule B is generated by the electric field
arising from charge density fluctuations in molecule A (and viceversa). Within
a second-order perturbative approach, these contributions manifest as an
effective intermolecular exchange interaction. Although expected to be weaker
than the standard London forces, these interactions display the same R$^6$
distance scaling.

Kac-Moody algebra. Next we adapt Shabat's method for constructing the
fundamental analytic solutions of the Lax operators $L$. Thus we are able to
reduce the direct and inverse spectral problems for $L$ to Riemann-Hilbert
problems (RHP) on the union of $2h$ rays $l_\nu$. They start from the origin of
the complex $\lambda$-plane and close equal angles $\pi/h$. To each $l_\nu$ we
associate a subalgebra $\mathfrak{g}_\nu$ which is a direct sum of
$sl(2)$-subalgebras. Thus to each regular solution of the RHP we can associate
scattering data of $L$ consisting of scattering matrices $T_\nu \in

is to extract from $T_0$ and $T_1$ related to the rays $l_0$ and $l_1$ the
minimal sets of scattering data $\mathcal{T}_k$, $k=1, 2$. We prove that each
of the minimal sets $\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ allows one to

These systems occur in the simulation of fluid flow in vascularized biological

processes, such as heat and mass transfer, are usually dominated by the
exchange between the network system and the embedding domain. By explicitly
resolving the interface between these domains with the computational mesh, we
can accurately describe these processes. The network is efficiently described
by a network of line segments. Coupling terms are evaluated by projection of
the interface variables. The new method is naturally applicable for nonlinear

the development of novel implicit interface 1D-3D methods and in the design of
verification benchmarks for embedded tubular network methods. Implicit

be very efficient but have only been mathematically analyzed for linear

relaxing to a configuration, the hard core structure, which is unstable in pure
tungsten. The reconstruction corresponds to a strong binding of carbon in the
prismatic sites created by the dislocation which is perfect for high
concentrations of carbon segregated on the dislocation line. However, the
reconstruction is only partial for lower atomic fractions, with the dislocation
tending to fall back in its easy core ground state. This pinning by carbon
atoms of the dislocation in an unstable position is well described by a simple
line tension model. A strong carbon-dislocation attraction is also evidenced at
larger separation distances, when the solute is in the fourth nearest neighbour
octahedral sites of the reconstructed core. The equilibrium concentrations of
carbon in these different segregation sites are modelled with an Ising model
and using a mean-field approximation. This thermodynamic model evidences that
screw dislocations remain fully saturated by carbon atoms and pinned in their
hard core configuration up to about 2500 K.

mixed traffic in the near future. Connected and automated vehicles can benefit
human-driven ones and the whole traffic system in different ways, for example
by improving collision avoidance and reducing traffic waves. Many studies have
been carried out to improve intersection management, a significant bottleneck
in traffic, with intelligent traffic signals or exclusively automated vehicles.
However, the problem of how to improve mixed traffic at unsignalized

approach to optimizing traffic flow at intersections in mixed traffic
situations using deep reinforcement learning. Our reinforcement learning agent
learns a policy for a centralized controller to let connected autonomous
vehicles at unsignalized intersections give up their right of way and yield to
other vehicles to optimize traffic flow. We implemented our approach and tested
it in the traffic simulator SUMO based on simulated and real traffic data. The
experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method significantly improves
traffic flow through unsignalized intersections in mixed traffic settings and
also provides better performance on a wide range of traffic situations compared

diagrammatic expansion of the electron-photon interaction, we describe
signatures of light-matter hybridization characterized by large asymmetric
shifts of the spectral weight at resonant frequencies. We follow the evolution
of the light-dressing from the cavity to the free-space limit. In the cavity
limit, light-matter hybridization results in a modification of the optical gap
with sizeable spectral weight appearing below the bare gap edge. In the limit
of large cavities, we find a residual redistribution of spectral weight which
becomes independent of the distance between the two mirrors. We show that the
photon dressing of the electronic response can be fully explained by using a
classical description of light. The classical description is found to hold up
to a strong coupling regime of the light-matter interaction highlighted by the
large modification of the photon spectra with respect to the empty cavity. We
show that, despite the strong coupling, quantum corrections are negligibly
small and weakly dependent on the cavity confinement. As a consequence, in
contrast to the optical gap, the single particle electronic band gap is not
sensibly modified by the strong-coupling. Our results show that quantum
corrections are dominated by off-resonant photon modes at high energy. As such,
cavity confinement can hardly be seen as a knob to control the quantum effects

colloidal interactions arising from binary co-solute mixtures of hard spheres

species, we show that the resulting effective potential $V_\text{eff}$
continuously changes from the one obtained for a single-component hard sphere
co-solute to that mediated by the single-component patchy particle co-solute.
Interestingly, we find that, independently of the relative concentration of the
two components, the resulting $V_\text{eff}$ is additive, i.e., it is
well-described by the linear combination of the effective interactions mediated
by respective pure co-solutes. However, a breakdown of the additivity occurs
when the co-solute mixture is close to the onset of a demixing transition.
These results represent a step forward in understanding and predicting

Social interactions are represented through age group to age group contact

equations, with integral terms modelling the non-locality. One common formalism
is the aggregation-diffusion equation, a class of advection diffusion models
with non-local advection. This was originally used to model a single
population, but has recently been extended to the multi-species case to model
the way organisms may alter their movement in the presence of coexistent
species. Here we prove existence theorems for a class of non-local
multi-species advection-diffusion models, with an arbitrary number of
co-existent species. We prove global existence for models in n=1 spatial
dimension and local existence for n>1. We describe an efficient spectral method
for numerically solving these models and provide example simulation output.

$t=\min(d,e)$ canonical angles $0\leqslant \theta_1\leqslant \cdots\leqslant

$H(B)=\mathrm{covol}(B\cap\mathbb{Z}^n)$. We denote by $\mu_n(A\vert e)_j$ the

studied in some detail, previous studies have typically used approximate
initial conditions for the accretion disks, or started from purely
hydrodynamical simulations. In this work, we analyse the properties of
accretion disks formed from near equal-mass black hole-neutron star mergers

with an accurate microphysical description. The post-merger systems were
evolved until $120\, {\rm ms}$ for different finite-temperature equations of

of the rest-mass density, which can be used for the construction of equilibrium
disk models. Finally, we evolve one of the systems for a total of $350\, \rm
ms$ after merger and study the prospect for eventual jet launching. While our
simulations do not reach this stage, we find clear evidence of continued funnel

recolliding trajectories of the second electron excited by the first- or

alternatives that can alleviate this issue have been proposed. In this context,
we consider a simple alternative based on minimal feedback, which we call
Decoupled Greedy Learning (DGL). It is based on a classic greedy relaxation of
the joint training objective, recently shown to be effective in the context of
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on large-scale image classification. We
consider an optimization of this objective that permits us to decouple the
layer training, allowing for layers or modules in networks to be trained with a
potentially linear parallelization. With the use of a replay buffer we show
that this approach can be extended to asynchronous settings, where modules can
operate and continue to update with possibly large communication delays. To
address bandwidth and memory issues we propose an approach based on online
vector quantization. This allows to drastically reduce the communication
bandwidth between modules and required memory for replay buffers. We show
theoretically and empirically that this approach converges and compare it to
the sequential solvers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DGL against
alternative approaches on the CIFAR-10 dataset and on the large-scale ImageNet

knee of the cosmic ray spectrum (few $10^{15}$ eV), is crucial to understand
the origin of cosmic rays in the Galaxy. We provide an update on the
unidentified source HESS J1702-420, a promising PeVatron candidate. We present
new observations of HESS J1702-420 made with the High Energy Stereoscopic
System (H.E.S.S.), and processed using improved analysis techniques. The
analysis configuration was optimized to enhance the collection area at the
highest energies. We applied a three-dimensional (3D) likelihood analysis to
model the source region and adjust non thermal radiative spectral models to the
$\gamma$-ray data. We also analyzed archival data from the Fermi Large Area
Telescope (LAT) to constrain the source spectrum at $\gamma$-ray energies >10
GeV. We report the detection of a new source component called HESS J1702-420A,
that was separated from the bulk of TeV emission at a $5.4\sigma$ confidence
level. The power law $\gamma$-ray spectrum of HESS J1702-420A extends with an
index of $\Gamma=1.53\pm0.19_\text{stat}\pm0.20_\text{sys}$ and without
curvature up to the energy band 64-113 TeV, in which it was detected by
H.E.S.S. at a $4.0\sigma$ confidence level. This brings evidence for the source
emission up to $100\,\text{TeV}$, which makes HESS J1702-420A a compelling
candidate site for the presence of extremely high energy cosmic rays.
Remarkably, in a hadronic scenario, the cut-off energy of the proton
distribution powering HESS J1702-420A is found to be higher than 0.5 PeV at a
95% confidence level. HESS J1702-420A becomes therefore one of the most solid
PeVatron candidates detected so far in H.E.S.S. data, altough a leptonic origin
of its emission could not be ruled out either.

generate high-quality samples by estimating the gradient of the data density.
The framework defines the prior noise as a standard Gaussian distribution,
whereas the corresponding data distribution may be more complicated than the
standard Gaussian distribution, which potentially introduces inefficiency in
denoising the prior noise into the data sample because of the discrepancy
between the data and the prior. In this paper, we propose PriorGrad to improve
the efficiency of the conditional diffusion model for speech synthesis (for
example, a vocoder using a mel-spectrogram as the condition) by applying an
adaptive prior derived from the data statistics based on the conditional
information. We formulate the training and sampling procedures of PriorGrad and
demonstrate the advantages of an adaptive prior through a theoretical analysis.
Focusing on the speech synthesis domain, we consider the recently proposed
diffusion-based speech generative models based on both the spectral and time
domains and show that PriorGrad achieves faster convergence and inference with
superior performance, leading to an improved perceptual quality and robustness
to a smaller network capacity, and thereby demonstrating the efficiency of a
data-dependent adaptive prior.

Second, we apply the methodology to infer the thermoacoustic states and heat
release parameters on the fly without storing data (real-time). We perform twin
experiments using synthetic acoustic pressure measurements to analyse the
performance of data assimilation in all nonlinear thermoacoustic regimes, from
limit cycles to chaos, and interpret the results physically. Third, we propose
practical rules for thermoacoustic data assimilation. An increase, reject,
inflate strategy is proposed to deal with the rich nonlinear behaviour; and
physical time scales for assimilation are proposed in non-chaotic regimes (with
the Nyquist-Shannon criterion) and in chaotic regimes (with the Lyapunov time).
Fourth, we perform data assimilation using data from a higher-fidelity model.
We introduce an echo state network to estimate in real-time the forecast bias,

correct acoustic pressure, parameters, and model bias can be accurately

the observations (up to 50% the mean values); (iii) the uncertainty of the
prediction and parameters is naturally part of the output; and (iv) both the

has broad applications in numerous areas such as machine translation, document
summarization, and dialog systems. Approaches that enable such control in a
zero-shot manner would be of great importance as, among other reasons, they
remove the need for additional annotated data and training. In this work, we
propose novel approaches for controlling encoder-decoder transformer-based NLG
models in zero-shot. This is done by introducing three control knobs, namely,
attention biasing, decoder mixing, and context augmentation, that are applied
to these models at generation time. These knobs control the generation process
by directly manipulating trained NLG models (e.g., biasing cross-attention
layers) to realize the desired attributes in the generated outputs. We show
that not only are these NLG models robust to such manipulations, but also their
behavior could be controlled without an impact on their generation performance.
These results, to the best of our knowledge, are the first of their kind.
Through these control knobs, we also investigate the role of transformer
decoder's self-attention module and show strong evidence that its primary role
is maintaining fluency of sentences generated by these models. Based on this
hypothesis, we show that alternative architectures for transformer decoders
could be viable options. We also study how this hypothesis could lead to more
efficient ways for training encoder-decoder transformer models.

frozen core orbitals and the unfrozen valence orbitals are introduced,
safeguarding against seemingly minor numerical deviations from the assumed
orthonormality conditions of the basis functions. A speedup of over two-fold
can be achieved for the diagonalization step in all-electron density-functional

in terms of the electron density, total energy, and atomic forces. This is
demonstrated in a benchmark study covering 103 materials across the periodic

structures including discontinuities. Their interaction with the Earth's bow
shock can significantly alter discontinuity configuration and stability. We
investigate such an interaction for the most widespread type of solar wind
discontinuities - rotational discontinuities (RDs). We use a set of in situ
multispacecraft observations and perform kinetic hybrid simulations. We focus
on the RD current density amplification that may lead to magnetic reconnection.
We show that the amplification can be as high as two orders of magnitude and is
mainly governed by three processes: the transverse magnetic field compression,
global thinning of RD, and interaction of RD with low-frequency electromagnetic
waves in the magnetosheath, downstream of the bow shock. The first factor is
found to substantially exceed simple hydrodynamic predictions in most observed
cases, the second effect has a rather moderate impact, while the third causes
strong oscillations of the current density. We show that the presence of
accelerated particles in the bow shock precursor highly boosts the current
density amplification, making the postshock magnetic reconnection more
probable. The pool of accelerated particles strongly affects the interaction of
RDs with the Earth's bow shock, as it is demonstrated by observational data
analysis and hybrid code simulations. Thus, shocks should be distinguished not
by the inclination angle, but rather by the presence of foreshocks populated
with shock reflected particles. Plasma processes in the RD-shock interaction
affect magnetic structures and turbulence in the Earth's magnetosphere and may
have implications for the processes in astrophysics.

redshift (within 500 $\textrm{km}$ $\textrm{s}^{-1}$) in multiple sightlines,
finding with $>$ 99.9% significance that these systems are more frequent in the
observed quasar spectra than in a randomly distributed population of absorbers.
This is driven primarily by absorption with column densities N(H I) $> 10^{14}$

densities are consistent with a random distribution. Star-forming galaxies are
more likely to be associated with multi-sightline absorption than quiescent

these galaxies. We observe a bimodality in the position angle of detected
galaxy-absorber pairs, again driven mostly by high-column-density absorbers,

visual tasks. A straightforward approach for handling scale in a deep network
is to process an image at several scales simultaneously in a set of scale
channels. Scale invariance can then, in principle, be achieved by using weight
sharing between the scale channels together with max or average pooling over
the outputs from the scale channels. The ability of such scale channel networks
to generalise to scales not present in the training set over significant scale
ranges has, however, not previously been explored.
  In this paper, we present a systematic study of this methodology by
implementing different types of scale channel networks and evaluating their
ability to generalise to previously unseen scales. We develop a formalism for
analysing the covariance and invariance properties of scale channel networks,
and explore how different design choices, unique to scaling transformations,
affect the overall performance of scale channel networks. We first show that
two previously proposed scale channel network designs do not generalise well to
scales not present in the training set. We explain theoretically and
demonstrate experimentally why generalisation fails in these cases.
  We then propose a new type of foveated scale channel architecture}, where the
scale channels process increasingly larger parts of the image with decreasing
resolution. This new type of scale channel network is shown to generalise
extremely well, provided sufficient image resolution and the absence of
boundary effects. Our proposed FovMax and FovAvg networks perform almost
identically over a scale range of 8, also when training on single scale
training data, and do also give improved performance when learning from
datasets with large scale variations in the small sample regime.

  Networks","Includes: 31 Pages, 5 Tables, 15 Figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Metric learning algorithms aim to learn a distance function that brings the
semantically similar data items together and keeps dissimilar ones at a
distance. The traditional Mahalanobis distance learning is equivalent to find a
linear projection. In contrast, Deep Metric Learning (DML) methods are proposed
that automatically extract features from data and learn a non-linear
transformation from input space to a semantically embedding space. Recently,
many DML methods are proposed focused to enhance the discrimination power of
the learned metric by providing novel sampling strategies or loss functions.
This approach is very helpful when both the training and test examples are
coming from the same set of categories. However, it is less effective in many
applications of DML such as image retrieval and person-reidentification. Here,
the DML should learn general semantic concepts from observed classes and employ
them to rank or identify objects from unseen categories. Neglecting the
generalization ability of the learned representation and just emphasizing to
learn a more discriminative embedding on the observed classes may lead to the
overfitting problem. To address this limitation, we propose a framework to
enhance the generalization power of existing DML methods in a Zero-Shot
Learning (ZSL) setting by general yet discriminative representation learning
and employing a class adversarial neural network. To learn a more general
representation, we propose to employ feature maps of intermediate layers in a
deep neural network and enhance their discrimination power through an attention
mechanism. Besides, a class adversarial network is utilized to enforce the deep
model to seek class invariant features for the DML task. We evaluate our work
on widely used machine vision datasets in a ZSL setting.

  Assumption",,,,,"econ.EM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we develop a method to assess the sensitivity of local average
treatment effect estimates to potential violations of the monotonicity
assumption of Imbens and Angrist (1994). We parameterize the degree to which
monotonicity is violated using two sensitivity parameters: the first one
determines the share of defiers in the population, and the second one measures
differences in the distributions of outcomes between compliers and defiers. For
each pair of values of these sensitivity parameters, we derive sharp bounds on
the outcome distributions of compliers in the first-order stochastic dominance
sense. We identify the robust region that is the set of all values of
sensitivity parameters for which a given empirical conclusion, e.g. that the
local average treatment effect is positive, is valid. Researchers can assess
the credibility of their conclusion by evaluating whether all the plausible
sensitivity parameters lie in the robust region. We obtain confidence sets for
the robust region through a bootstrap procedure and illustrate the sensitivity
analysis in an empirical application. We also extend this framework to analyze
treatment effects of the entire population.

Here, we illustrate that capturing the essence of an audio source is typically

Specifically, we present a GAN-based generative model that can be trained on
one short audio signal from any domain (e.g. speech, music, etc.) and does not
require pre-training or any other form of external supervision. Once trained,
our model can generate random samples of arbitrary duration that maintain
semantic similarity to the training waveform, yet exhibit new compositions of
its audio primitives. This enables a long line of interesting applications,
including generating new jazz improvisations or new a-cappella rap variants
based on a single short example, producing coherent modifications to famous
songs (e.g. adding a new verse to a Beatles song based solely on the original
recording), filling-in of missing parts (inpainting), extending the bandwidth
of a speech signal (super-resolution), and enhancing old recordings without
access to any clean training example. We show that in all cases, no more than

occurring on a continuous range of time-scales, from minutes to years, is most

blazar emission properties from the radio to the gamma-ray band. Moreover, in
recent years, a lot of effort has been devoted to the observation and analysis
of the blazar polarimetric radio and optical behaviour, showing strong

corresponding data analysis have contributed to the understanding of the blazar

thus take inspiration from the literature on bonus-based exploration to design
a new offline RL agent. The core idea is to subtract a prediction-based
exploration bonus from the reward, instead of adding it for exploration. This
allows the policy to stay close to the support of the dataset. We connect this

challenged this belief, showing that, on standard benchmarks, complex
encoder-decoder architectures perform similarly to nearest-neighbor baselines
or simple linear decoder models that exploit large amounts of per-category
data. However, building large collections of 3D shapes for supervised training
is a laborious process; a more realistic and less constraining task is
inferring 3D shapes for categories with few available training examples,
calling for a model that can successfully generalize to novel object classes.
In this work we experimentally demonstrate that naive baselines fail in this
few-shot learning setting, in which the network must learn informative shape
priors for inference of new categories. We propose three ways to learn a
class-specific global shape prior, directly from data. Using these techniques,
we are able to capture multi-scale information about the 3D shape, and account
for intra-class variability by virtue of an implicit compositional structure.
Experiments on the popular ShapeNet dataset show that our method outperforms a
zero-shot baseline by over 40%, and the current state-of-the-art by over 10%,
in terms of relative performance, in the few-shot setting.

observed in partially filled Landau levels. Both microscopic wave functions and
semi-classical dynamics suggest that a CF is a dipole consisting of an electron
and a double $2h/e$ quantum vortex, and its motion is subject to a Berry
curvature that is uniformly distributed in the momentum space. Based on the
picture, we study the electromagnetic response of composite fermions. We find
that the response in the long-wavelength limit has a form identical to that of
the Dirac CF theory. To obtain the result, we show that the Berry curvature
contributes a half-quantized Hall conductance which, notably, is independent of
the filling factor of a Landau level and not altered by the presence of
impurities. The latter is because CFs undergo no side-jumps when scattered by
quenched impurities in a Landau-level with the particle-hole symmetry. The
remainder of the response is from an effective system that has the same Fermi
wavevector, effective density, Berry phase, and therefore long-wavelength
response to electromagnetic fields as a Dirac CF system. By interpreting the
half-quantized Hall conductance as a contribution from a redefined vacuum, we
can explicitly show the emergence of a Dirac CF effective description from the
dipole picture. We further determine corrections due to electric quadrupoles
and magnetic moments of CFs and show deviations from the Dirac CF theory when
moving away from the long wavelength limit.

layer) are supposed to be identical for all architectures (paths) in the
supernet. However, this rules out the possibility of adjusting operation
weights to cater for different paths, which limits the reliability of the
evaluation results. In this paper, instead of counting on a single supernet, we
introduce $K$-shot supernets and take their weights for each operation as a
dictionary. The operation weight for each path is represented as a convex
combination of items in a dictionary with a simplex code. This enables a matrix
approximation of the stand-alone weight matrix with a higher rank ($K>1$). A
\textit{simplex-net} is introduced to produce architecture-customized code for
each path. As a result, all paths can adaptively learn how to share weights in
the $K$-shot supernets and acquire corresponding weights for better evaluation.
$K$-shot supernets and simplex-net can be iteratively trained, and we further
extend the search to the channel dimension. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets validate that K-shot NAS significantly improves the evaluation
accuracy of paths and thus brings in impressive performance improvements.

non-thermal radiation. Extraction of the rotational energy via electromagnetic
stresses produces magnetically-dominated jets, which may become turbulent.
Studies of magnetically-dominated plasma turbulence from first principles show
that most of the accelerated particles have small pitch angles, i.e. the
particle velocity is nearly aligned with the local magnetic field. We examine
synchrotron-self-Compton radiation from anisotropic particles in the fast
cooling regime. The small pitch angles reduce the synchrotron cooling rate and
promote the role of inverse Compton (IC) cooling, which can occur in two
different regimes. In the Thomson regime, both synchrotron and IC components
have soft spectra, $\nu F_\nu\propto\nu^{1/2}$. In the Klein-Nishina regime,
synchrotron radiation has a hard spectrum, typically $\nu F_\nu\propto\nu$,
over a broad range of frequencies. Our results have implications for the
modelling of BL Lacs and Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). BL Lacs produce soft
synchrotron and IC spectra, as expected when Klein-Nishina effects are minor.
The observed synchrotron and IC luminosities are typically comparable, which
indicates a moderate anisotropy with pitch angles $\theta\gtrsim0.1$. Rare
orphan gamma-ray flares may be produced when $\theta\ll0.1$. The hard spectra
of GRBs may be consistent with synchrotron radiation when the emitting
particles are IC cooling in the Klein-Nishina regime, as expected for pitch
angles $\theta\sim0.1$. Blazar and GRB spectra can be explained by turbulent
jets with a similar electron plasma magnetisation parameter, $\sigma_{\rm
e}\sim10^4$, which for electron-proton plasmas corresponds to an overall
magnetisation $\sigma=(m_{\rm e}/m_{\rm p})\sigma_{\rm e}\sim10$.

and $x_1$ into short hashes $h(x_0)$ and $h(x_1)$ in a manner that allows for
computing a predicate $P(x_0, x_1)$ given only the two hash values without

adversarially robust if an adversary that gets to pick $x_0$ and $x_1$ after
the hash function has been sampled, cannot find inputs for which the predicate
evaluated on the hash values outputs the incorrect result.
  In this work we construct robust property-preserving hash functions for the
hamming-distance predicate which distinguishes inputs with a hamming distance
at least some threshold $t$ from those with distance less than $t$. The
security of the construction is based on standard lattice hardness assumptions.
  Our construction has several advantages over the best known previous
construction by Fleischhacker and Simkin. Our construction relies on a single
well-studied hardness assumption from lattice cryptography whereas the previous
work relied on a newly introduced family of computational hardness assumptions.
In terms of computational effort, our construction only requires a small number
of modular additions per input bit, whereas previously several exponentiations
per bit as well as the interpolation and evaluation of high-degree polynomials
over large fields were required. An additional benefit of our construction is
that the description of the hash function can be compressed to $\lambda$ bits
assuming a random oracle. Previous work has descriptions of length
$\mathcal{O}(\ell \lambda)$ bits for input bit-length $\ell$, which has a
secret structure and thus cannot be compressed.
  We prove a lower bound on the output size of any property-preserving hash
function for the hamming distance predicate. The bound shows that the size of
our hash value is not far from optimal.

wide variety of network and web based online applications. In such systems,
end-to-end application performance heavily depends on the fraction of objects
transferred from the cache, also known as the cache hit probability. Many
caching policies have been proposed and implemented to improve the hit
probability. In this work, we propose a new method to compute an upper bound on
hit probability for all non-anticipative caching policies, i.e., for policies
that have no knowledge of future requests. Our key insight is to order the
objects according to the ratio of their Hazard Rate (HR) function values to
their sizes and place in the cache the objects with the largest ratios till the
cache capacity is exhausted. Under some statistical assumptions, we prove that
our proposed HR to size ratio based ordering model computes the maximum
achievable hit probability and serves as an upper bound for all
non-anticipative caching policies. We derive closed form expressions for the
upper bound under some specific object request arrival processes. We also
provide simulation results to validate its correctness and to compare it to the
state-of-the-art upper bounds. We find it to be tighter than state-of-the-art
upper bounds for a variety of object request arrival processes.

has seen considerable progress, but the inherent presence of radiofrequency
(rf) fields in such hybrid traps was found to have a limiting impact on the
achievable collision energies. Recently, it was shown that suitable
combinations of optical dipole traps (ODTs) can be used for trapping both atoms
and atomic ions alike, allowing to carry out experiments in absence of any rf
fields. Here, we show that the expected cooling in such bichromatic traps is
highly sensitive to relative position fluctuations between the two optical
trapping beams, suggesting that this is the dominant mechanism limiting the
currently observed cooling performance. We discuss strategies for mitigating
these effects by using optimized setups featuring adapted ODT configurations.
This includes proposed schemes that may mitigate three-body losses expected at
very low temperatures, allowing to access the quantum dominated regime of
interaction.

(LVGP) model through which different classes of microstructures are mapped into
a low-dimensional continuous latent space. It provides an interpretable
distance metric between classes and captures their effects on the homogenized
stiffness tensors. By introducing latent vectors as design variables, a
differentiable transition of stiffness matrix between classes can be easily
achieved with an analytical gradient. After integrating LVGP with the
density-based TO, an efficient data-driven cellular composite optimization
process is developed to enable concurrent exploration of microstructure
concepts and the associated volume fractions for natural frequency
optimization. Examples reveal that the proposed cellular designs with
multiclass microstructures achieve higher natural frequencies than both
single-scale and single-class designs. This framework can be easily extended to
other multi-scale TO problems, such as thermal compliance and dynamic response

mass of about 1 TeV was the natural completion of non-renormalizable Glashow
model. This mass was thus a second threshold for weak interactions, as the W
mass was for the non-renormalizable 4-fermion V-A theory. Today, after the
observation of the narrow scalar resonance at 125 GeV, Veltman's large-mass
idea seems to be ruled out. Yet, this is not necessarily true. Depending on the
description of SSB in $\Phi^4$ theory, and by combining analytic calculations
and lattice simulations, besides the known particle at 125 GeV, a new resonance
of the Higgs field may also show up around 700 GeV. The peculiarity, though, is
that this heavier state would couple to longitudinal vector bosons with the
same typical strength of the low-mass state and thus represent a relatively
narrow resonance. In this way, such hypothetical new resonance would naturally
fit with some excess of 4-lepton events observed by ATLAS around 680 GeV.
Analogous data from CMS are needed to confirm or disprove this interpretation.
Implications of a two-mass structure for radiative corrections are also
discussed.

crucial step. Machine learning plays a vital role in this type of intent
classification. In reality, it is typical to collect confirmation from customer
support representatives (CSRs) regarding the intent prediction, though it can
unnecessarily incur prohibitive cost to ask CSRs to assign existing or new
intents to the mis-classified cases. Apart from the confirmed cases with and
without intent labels, there can be a number of cases with no human curation.
This data composition (Positives + Unlabeled + multiclass Negatives) creates
unique challenges for model development. In response to that, we propose a
semi-supervised multi-task learning paradigm. In this manuscript, we share our
experience in building text-based intent classification models for a customer
support service on an E-commerce website. We improve the performance
significantly by evolving the model from multiclass classification to
semi-supervised multi-task learning by leveraging the negative cases, domain-
and task-adaptively pretrained ALBERT on customer contact texts, and a number
of un-curated data with no labels. In the evaluation, the final model boosts
the average AUC ROC by almost 20 points compared to the baseline finetuned
multiclass classification ALBERT model.

explanation for the disagreement effect, the low inter-rater reliability
consistently observed in peer review. To investigate this basic assumption, we
have surveyed all humanities scholars in Switzerland on 23 grant review
criteria. We have employed latent class tree modelling to identify subgroups in
which scholars rated criteria similarly (i.e. latent classes) and to explore
covariates predicting class membership. We have identified two consensus
classes, two consensus-close classes, and a consensus-far class. The consensus
classes contain a core consensus (ten criteria related to knowledge gaps,
feasibility, rigour, comprehensibility and argumentation, and academic
relevance, as well as to the competence and experience of the applicant) and a
broad consensus that includes the core consensus plus eight
contribution-related criteria, such as originality. These results provide a
possible explanation for the disagreement effect. Moreover, the results are
consistent with the notion of conservatism, which holds that original research
is undervalued in peer review, while other aspects, such as methodology and
feasibility, are overweighted. The covariate analysis indicated that age and
having tenure increases from the consensus-far to the consensus-close to the
consensus classes. This suggests that the more academic experience scholars
accumulate, the more their understanding of review criteria conforms to the

of designing routes for vehicles to visit customers in such a fashion that a
cost function, typically the number of vehicles, or the total travelled
distance is minimized. The problem finds applications in industrial scenarios,
for example where Automated Guided Vehicles run through the plant to deliver
components from the warehouse. This specific problem, henceforth called the
Electric Conflict-Free Vehicle Routing Problem (CF-EVRP), involves constraints
such as limited operating range of the vehicles, time windows on the delivery
to the customers, and limited capacity on the number of vehicles the road
segments can accommodate at the same time. Such a complex system results in a
large model that cannot easily be solved to optimality in reasonable time. We
therefore developed a compositional model that breaks down the problem into
smaller and simpler sub-problems and provides sub-optimal, feasible solutions
to the original problem. The algorithm exploits the strengths of SMT solvers,
which proved in our previous work to be an efficient approach to deal with
scheduling problems. Compared to a monolithic model for the CF-EVRP, written in
the SMT standard language and solved using a state-of-the-art SMT solver the
compositional model was found to be significantly faster.

Nevanlinna functions.
  We give upper and lower bounds for $|q_H(z)|$ and $\operatorname{Im} q_H(z)$

a function of time. We find that the latter displays coherent oscillations, and
we show numerically that the probability distribution for its phase is bimodal

an external time-dependent potential, given by the magnetization. This dynamics
exhibits two distinct time scales, with the fast one associated to the
oscillations of the global magnetization vector. Performing an average over the

the individual rotator. This force is always bimodal, and determines a low

anomaly model is highly challenging due to insufficient anomaly labels and the
prohibitively expensive cost of obtaining anomaly examples. It imposes a
significant bottleneck to evaluate model quality for model selection and
parameter tuning reliably. As a result, many existing anomaly detection
algorithms fail to show their promised performance after deployment.
  In this paper, we propose LaF-AD, a novel anomaly detection algorithm with
label-free model selection for unlabeled times-series data. Our proposed
algorithm performs a fully unsupervised ensemble learning across a large number
of candidate parametric models. We develop a model variance metric that
quantifies the sensitivity of anomaly probability with a bootstrapping method.
Then it makes a collective decision for anomaly events by model learners using
the model variance. Our algorithm is easily parallelizable, more robust for
ill-conditioned and seasonal data, and highly scalable for a large number of
anomaly models. We evaluate our algorithm against other state-of-the-art
methods on a synthetic domain and a benchmark public data set.

for learning generalizable, transferable and robust representations from
unlabeled graphs. Among many, graph contrastive learning (GraphCL) has emerged
with promising representation learning performance. Unfortunately, unlike its
counterpart on image data, the effectiveness of GraphCL hinges on ad-hoc data
augmentations, which have to be manually picked per dataset, by either rules of
thumb or trial-and-errors, owing to the diverse nature of graph data. That
significantly limits the more general applicability of GraphCL. Aiming to fill
in this crucial gap, this paper proposes a unified bi-level optimization
framework to automatically, adaptively and dynamically select data
augmentations when performing GraphCL on specific graph data. The general
framework, dubbed JOint Augmentation Optimization (JOAO), is instantiated as
min-max optimization. The selections of augmentations made by JOAO are shown to
be in general aligned with previous ""best practices"" observed from handcrafted
tuning: yet now being automated, more flexible and versatile. Moreover, we
propose a new augmentation-aware projection head mechanism, which will route
output features through different projection heads corresponding to different
augmentations chosen at each training step. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that JOAO performs on par with or sometimes better than the state-of-the-art
competitors including GraphCL, on multiple graph datasets of various scales and
types, yet without resorting to any laborious dataset-specific tuning on
augmentation selection. We release the code at

dimensional (3D) structural details of the electrochemically plated lithium
(Li) flakes and their solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), including the
composite SEI skin-layer and SEI fossil pieces buried inside the Li matrix. As
the SEI skin-layer is largely comprised of nanocrystalline LiF and Li2O in
amorphous polymeric matrix, when complete Li stripping occurs, the compromised
SEI three-dimensional framework buckles, forming nanoscale bends and wrinkles.
We showed that the flexibility and resilience of the SEI skin-layer plays a
vital role in preserving an intact SEI 3D framework after Li stripping. The
intact SEI network enables the nucleation and growth of the newly plated Li
inside the previously formed SEI network in the subsequent cycles, preventing
additional large amount of SEI formation between newly plated Li metal and the
electrolyte. In addition, cells cycled under the accurately controlled uniaxial
pressure can further enhance the repeated utilization of the SEI framework and
improve the coulombic efficiency (CE) by up to 97%, demonstrating an effective
strategy of reducing the formation of additional SEI and inactive dead Li. The
identification of such flexible and porous 3D SEI framework clarifies the
working mechanism of SEI in lithium metal anode for batteries. The insights
provided in this work will inspire researchers to design more functional
artificial 3D SEI on other metal anodes to improve rechargeable metal battery

Detecting such knowledge reuse is nontrivial because the suspect models may not

propose ModelDiff, a testing-based approach to deep learning model similarity
comparison. Instead of directly comparing the weights, activations, or outputs
of two models, we compare their behavioral patterns on the same set of test
inputs. Specifically, the behavioral pattern of a model is represented as a
decision distance vector (DDV), in which each element is the distance between
the model's reactions to a pair of inputs. The knowledge similarity between two
models is measured with the cosine similarity between their DDVs. To evaluate
ModelDiff, we created a benchmark that contains 144 pairs of models that cover
most popular model reuse methods, including transfer learning, model
compression, and model stealing. Our method achieved 91.7% correctness on the
benchmark, which demonstrates the effectiveness of using ModelDiff for model
reuse detection. A study on mobile deep learning apps has shown the feasibility

evidence that if an integer quantum Hall (IQH) system has asymmetric confining

quasi-one-dimensional orbit-like states similar to the current-carrying edging

interpreted in terms of a quantum phase transition from the IQH system, which
is accompanied by the breaking of translational symmetry in the direction of

at 3-20 GHz and scan angles out to 60 degree from normal. The fabrication

the 'Sub-Miniature Push-on, Micro' (SMPM) connectors directly onto the

then, we apply attention transforming on the feature-channel dimension so that
the model can enhance more relevant spatial features. The most crucial step is
to slice the data in the time dimension for attention transforming, and finally
obtain a highly distinguishable representation. At this time, global averaging
pooling and a simple fully-connected layer are used to classify different
categories of EEG data. Experiments on two public datasets indicate that the
strategy of attention transforming effectively utilizes spatial and temporal
features. And we have reached the level of the state-of-the-art in
multi-classification of EEG, with fewer parameters. As far as we know, it is

leads to uncertainty in future climate risks. Consequently, there is a need to
understand how those parameter uncertainties impact our assessment of future
climate risks and the efficacy of strategies to manage them. Here, we use
random forests to examine the parametric drivers of future climate risk and how
the relative importances of those drivers change over time. We find that the
equilibrium climate sensitivity and a factor that scales the effect of aerosols
on radiative forcing are consistently the most important climate model
parametric uncertainties throughout the 2020 to 2150 interval for both low and
high radiative forcing scenarios. The near-term hazards of high-end sea-level
rise are driven primarily by thermal expansion, while the longer-term hazards
are associated with mass loss from the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets. Our
results highlight the practical importance of considering time-evolving

(circumpolar) mean stratospheric temperature at a given pressure level. It can
be seen as an extension of previous studies which have developed stochastic
models for surface temperatures. The proposed model is a sum of a deterministic
seasonality function and a L\'evy-driven multidimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck
process, which is a mean-reverting stochastic process. More specifically, the
deseasonalized temperature model is an order 4 continuous time autoregressive
model, meaning that the stratospheric temperature is modeled to be directly
dependent on the temperature over four preceding days, while the model's
longer-range memory stems from its recursive nature. This study is based on
temperature data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
ERA-Interim reanalysis model product. The residuals of the autoregressive model
are well-represented by normal inverse Gaussian distributed random variables
scaled with a time-dependent volatility function. A monthly variability in
speed of mean reversion of stratospheric temperature is found, hence suggesting
a generalization of the 4th order continuous time autoregressive model. A
stochastic stratospheric temperature model, as proposed in this paper, can be
used in geophysical analyses to improve the understanding of stratospheric
dynamics. In particular, such characterizations of stratospheric temperature
may be a step towards greater insight in modeling and prediction of large-scale
middle atmospheric events, such as for example sudden stratospheric warmings.
Through stratosphere-troposphere coupling, the stratosphere is hence a source
of extended tropospheric predictability at weekly to monthly timescales, which
is of great importance in several societal and industry sectors.

generalize some results which hold for the classical C-algebras. We also
discuss some illustrative examples to show accuracy and effectiveness of the
new findings. If we take the identity function I instead of the generators
{\alpha} and {\beta} in the construction of the set C(N), then non-Newtonian
C-algebras turn into the classical C-algebras, so our results are stronger than
some knowledge and facts in the most existing literature.

  presence of large amounts of solar power and community-scale energy storage",,,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Electricity distribution networks that contain large photovoltaic solar
systems can experience power flows between customers. These may create both
technical and socio-economic challenges. This paper establishes how these
challenges can be addressed through the combined deployment of Community-scale
Energy Storage (CES) and local network tariffs. Our study simulates the
operation of a CES under a range of local network tariff models, using current
Australian electricity prices and current network prices as a reference. We
assess the financial outcomes for solar and non-solar owning customers and the
distribution network operator. We find that tariff settings exist that create
mutual benefits for all stakeholders. Such tariffs all apply a discount of
greater than 50\% to energy flows within the local network, relative to regular
distribution network tariffs. The policy implication of these findings is that
the, historically contentious, issue of network tariff reform in the presence
of local solar power generation can be resolved with a mutually beneficial
arrangement of local network tariffs and CES. Furthermore, the challenge of
setting appropriate tariffs is eased through clear and intuitive conditions on
local network tariff pricing.
