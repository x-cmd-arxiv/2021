  Learning",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated Learning (FL) is emerging as a promising paradigm of
privacy-preserving machine learning, which trains an algorithm across multiple
clients without exchanging their data samples. Recent works highlighted several
privacy and robustness weaknesses in FL and addressed these concerns using
local differential privacy (LDP) and some well-studied methods used in
conventional ML, separately. However, it is still not clear how LDP affects
adversarial robustness in FL. To fill this gap, this work attempts to develop a
comprehensive understanding of the effects of LDP on adversarial robustness in
FL. Clarifying the interplay is significant since this is the first step
towards a principled design of private and robust FL systems. We certify that
local differential privacy has both positive and negative effects on
adversarial robustness using theoretical analysis and empirical verification.

  Prediction and Optimization of a Concrete Mixture",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the significant delay and cost associated with experimental tests, a
model based evaluation of concrete compressive strength is of high value, both
for the purpose of strength prediction as well as the mixture optimization. In
this regard, several recent studies have employed state-of-the-art regression
models in order to achieve a good prediction model, employing available
experimental data sets. Nevertheless, while each of the employed models can
better adapt to a specific nature of the input data, the accuracy of each
individual model is limited due to the sensitivity to the choice of
hyperparameters and the learning strategy. In the present work, we take a
further step towards improving the accuracy of the prediction model via the
weighted combination of multiple regression methods. Moreover, a (GA)-based
multi-objective mixture optimization is proposed, building on the obtained
multi-regression model. In particular, we present a data aided framework where
the regression methods based on artificial neural network, random forest
regression, and polynomial regression are jointly implemented to predict the
compressive strength of concrete. The outcome of the individual regression
models are then combined via a linear weighting strategy and optimized over the
training data set as a quadratic convex optimization problem. It is worth
mentioning that due to the convexity of the formulated problem, the globally
optimum weighting strategy is obtained via standard numerical solvers.
Employing the proposed GA-based optimization, a Pareto front of the cost-CS
trade-of has been obtained employing the available data set. Moreover, the
resulting accuracy of the proposed multi-model prediction method is shown to
outperform the available single-model regression methods in the literature by a
valuable margin, via numerical simulations.

functions, few flexibilities are provided even if the information of negative
keys (elements are not in the set) are available. The problem gets worse when
the misidentification of negative keys brings different costs. To address the
above problems, we propose a new Hash Adaptive Bloom Filter (HABF) that
supports the customization of hash functions for keys. The key idea of HABF is
to customize the hash functions for positive keys (elements are in the set) to
avoid negative keys with high cost, and pack customized hash functions into a
lightweight data structure named HashExpressor. Then, given an element at query
time, HABF follows a two-round pattern to check whether the element is in the
set. Further, we theoretically analyze the performance of HABF and bound the
expected false positive rate. We conduct extensive experiments on
representative datasets, and the results show that HABF outperforms the
standard Bloom filter and its cutting-edge variants on the whole in terms of

nodes in a social network that maximize the spread of influence. In this study,
we focus on a sub-class of IM problems, where whether the nodes are willing to
be the seeds when being invited is uncertain, called contingency-aware IM. Such
contingency aware IM is critical for applications for non-profit organizations
in low resource communities (e.g., spreading awareness of disease prevention).
Despite the initial success, a major practical obstacle in promoting the
solutions to more communities is the tremendous runtime of the greedy
algorithms and the lack of high performance computing (HPC) for the non-profits
in the field -- whenever there is a new social network, the non-profits usually
do not have the HPCs to recalculate the solutions. Motivated by this and
inspired by the line of works that use reinforcement learning (RL) to address
combinatorial optimization on graphs, we formalize the problem as a Markov
Decision Process (MDP), and use RL to learn an IM policy over historically seen
networks, and generalize to unseen networks with negligible runtime at test
phase. To fully exploit the properties of our targeted problem, we propose two
technical innovations that improve the existing methods, including
state-abstraction and theoretically grounded reward shaping. Empirical results

However, exposure bias can arise when users are systematically underexposed to
certain relevant items. For example, in citation networks, authors might be
more likely to encounter papers from their own field and thus cite them
preferentially. This bias can propagate through naively trained link
predictors, leading to both biased evaluation and high generalization error (as
assessed by true relevance). Moreover, this bias can be exacerbated by feedback
loops. We propose estimators that leverage known exposure probabilities to
mitigate this bias and consequent feedback loops. Next, we provide a loss

earlier they are used in the software development cycle, and fast response

in image-based medical diagnosis. However, interpreting the outputs of these
models remains a challenge. In cancer diagnosis, interpretability can be
achieved by localizing the region of the input image responsible for the
output, i.e. the location of a lesion. Alternatively, segmentation or detection
models can be trained with pixel-wise annotations indicating the locations of
malignant lesions. Unfortunately, acquiring such labels is labor-intensive and
requires medical expertise. To overcome this difficulty, weakly-supervised
localization can be utilized. These methods allow neural network classifiers to
output saliency maps highlighting the regions of the input most relevant to the
classification task (e.g. malignant lesions in mammograms) using only
image-level labels (e.g. whether the patient has cancer or not) during
training. When applied to high-resolution images, existing methods produce
low-resolution saliency maps. This is problematic in applications in which
suspicious lesions are small in relation to the image size. In this work, we
introduce a novel neural network architecture to perform weakly-supervised
segmentation of high-resolution images. The proposed model selects regions of
interest via coarse-level localization, and then performs fine-grained
segmentation of those regions. We apply this model to breast cancer diagnosis
with screening mammography, and validate it on a large clinically-realistic
dataset. Measured by Dice similarity score, our approach outperforms existing
methods by a large margin in terms of localization performance of benign and
malignant lesions, relatively improving the performance by 39.6% and 20.0%,

problem seems impossible in general, since there are seemingly many more
unknowns than knowns . Nevertheless, this problem arises in many application
fields; and empirically, some of these fields have had success using heuristic
methods -- even economically very important ones, in wireless communications
and oil exploration. Today's fashionable heuristic formulations pose non-convex
optimization problems which are then attacked heuristically as well. The fact
that blind deconvolution can be solved under some repeatable and
naturally-occurring circumstances poses a theoretical puzzle.
  To bridge the gulf between reported successes and theory's limited
understanding, we exhibit a convex optimization problem that -- assuming signal
sparsity -- can convert a crude approximation to the true filter into a
high-accuracy recovery of the true filter. Our proposed formulation is based on
L1 minimization of inverse filter outputs. We give sharp guarantees on
performance of the minimizer assuming sparsity of signal, showing that our
proposal precisely recovers the true inverse filter, up to shift and rescaling.
There is a sparsity/initial accuracy tradeoff: the less accurate the initial
approximation, the greater we rely on sparsity to enable exact recovery. To our
knowledge this is the first reported tradeoff of this kind. We consider it
surprising that this tradeoff is independent of dimension.
  We also develop finite-$N$ guarantees, for highly accurate reconstruction
under $N\geq O(k \log(k) )$ with high probability. We further show stable
approximation when the true inverse filter is infinitely long and extend our
guarantees to the case where the observations are contaminated by stochastic or
adversarial noise.

distribution, which is known as the radius gap. We explore an origin of the

predicts that type I planetary migration produces different configurations of
protoplanets with different masses and such different configurations can result
in two distinguishable populations of small-sized multi-planet systems. We then
perform an observational analysis to verify this prediction. In the analysis,
multiple Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests are applied to the observed systems, using
the statistical measures that are devised to systematically characterize the
properties of multi-planet systems. We find with 99.5\% confidence that the
observed, small-sized multi-planet systems are divided into two distinct
populations. The distinction likely originates from different spatial
distributions of protoplanets, which are determined by type I migration and
subsequently trigger giant impact. We also show that these distinct populations
are separated around the radius gap when the gas surface density of
protoplanetary disks is $\sim 10^2$ g cm$^{-2}$ in the vicinity of the host
stars. This work therefore emphasizes the importance of planetary migration and
the inner disk properties.

the width of the reconnecting current layer approaches the small characteristic

the radar system is sent to, and used by, a peripheral consuming system, such
as a missile system or a graphical user interface used by an operator. Those
systems process the data stream and make real-time, operational decisions based
on the data received. Given this, the reliability and availability of
information provided by radar systems has grown in importance. Although the
field of cyber security has been continuously evolving, no prior research has
focused on anomaly detection in radar systems. In this paper, we present a deep
learning-based method for detecting anomalies in radar system data streams. We
propose a novel technique which learns the correlation between numerical
features and an embedding representation of categorical features in an
unsupervised manner. The proposed technique, which allows the detection of
malicious manipulation of critical fields in the data stream, is complemented
by a timing-interval anomaly detection mechanism proposed for the detection of
message dropping attempts. Real radar system data is used to evaluate the
proposed method. Our experiments demonstrate the method's high detection
accuracy on a variety of data stream manipulation attacks (average detection
rate of 88% with 1.59% false alarms) and message dropping attacks (average
detection rate of 92% with 2.2% false alarms).

$\sim10\%$ level of the total density. Modelling of the overall acceleration
field by allowing non-equilibrium is a complicated task. We must learn to
distinguish whether density enhancements are persistent or not by their nature.
In the present paper, we elaborate our orbital arc method to include the
effects of massless perturbations and non-stationarities in the modelling. The
method is tested by modelling of simulation data and shown to be valid. We
apply the method to the Gaia DR 2 data within a region of $\sim 0.5$ kpc from
the Sun and confirm that acceleration field in the Solar Neighbourhood has a
perturbed nature -- the phase space density along the orbits of stars grow in
the order of $h\lesssim 5\%$ per Myr due to non-stationarity. This result is a
temporally local value and can be used only within the timeframe of a few Myrs.
An attempt to pinpoint the origin of the perturbation shows that the stars
having larger absolute angular momentum are the main carriers of the local
perturbation. As they are faster than the average thin disc star, they are
either originating further away and are close in their pericentre or they are
perturbed locally by a fast co-moving perturber, such as gas disc
inhomogenities.

algorithms in which agents form beliefs about the future actions of other
players based on local information, and take an action that maximizes their
expected utility computed with respect to these beliefs or continue to take
their previous action. We show convergence of these types of algorithms to a
Nash equilibrium in weakly acyclic games under the condition that the belief
update and information exchange protocols successfully learn the actions of
other players with positive probability in finite time given a static
environment, i.e., when other agents' actions do not change. We design a
decentralized fictitious play algorithm with voluntary and limited

communication protocol, each agent decides whom to exchange information with by
assessing the novelty of its information and the potential effect of its
information on others' assessments of their utility functions. The limited
communication protocol entails agents sending only their most frequent action
to agents that they decide to communicate with. Numerical experiments on a
target assignment game demonstrate that the voluntary and limited communication
protocol can more than halve the number of communication attempts while
retaining the same convergence rate as DFP in which agents constantly attempt

avoid over-fitting and enhance their generalization and performance, various
methods have been suggested in the literature, including dropout,
regularization, label smoothing, etc. One such method is augmentation which
introduces different types of corruption in the data to prevent the model from
overfitting and to memorize patterns present in the data. A sub-area of data
augmentation is image mixing and deleting. This specific type of augmentation
either deletes image regions or mixes two images to hide or make particular
characteristics of images confusing for the network, forcing it to emphasize
the overall structure of the object in an image. Models trained with this
approach have proven to perform and generalize well compared to those trained
without image mixing or deleting. An added benefit that comes with this method

metal positioned at an electric-field node within a dielectric thin-film
bandpass filter to select one transmission band while suppressing other
transmission bands that would have been present without the metal layer. Here,
we introduce a switchable mid-infrared ITF where the metal film can be
""switched on and off"", enabling the modulation of the filter response from
single-band to multiband. The switching is enabled by a deeply subwavelength
film of vanadium dioxide (VO2), which undergoes a reversible insulator-to-metal
phase transition. We designed and experimentally demonstrated an ITF that can
switch between two states: one broad passband across the long-wave infrared
(LWIR, 8 - 12 um) and one narrow passband at ~8.8 um. Our work generalizes the
ITF -- previously a niche type of bandpass filter -- into a new class of
tunable devices. Furthermore, our unique fabrication process -- which begins
with thin-film VO2 on a suspended membrane -- enables the integration of VO2
into any thin-film assembly that is compatible with physical vapor deposition
(PVD) processes, and is thus a new platform for realizing tunable thin-film
filters.

  Non-Lipschitz Objectives, and with Normalized Client Updates",,,,,"cs.LG cs.DC eess.SP math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There is a dearth of convergence results for differentially private federated
learning (FL) with non-Lipschitz objective functions (i.e., when gradient norms
are not bounded). The primary reason for this is that the clipping operation
(i.e., projection onto an $\ell_2$ ball of a fixed radius called the clipping
threshold) for bounding the sensitivity of the average update to each client's
update introduces bias depending on the clipping threshold and the number of
local steps in FL, and analyzing this is not easy. For Lipschitz functions, the
Lipschitz constant serves as a trivial clipping threshold with zero bias.
However, Lipschitzness does not hold in many practical settings; moreover,
verifying it and computing the Lipschitz constant is hard. Thus, the choice of
the clipping threshold is non-trivial and requires a lot of tuning in practice.
In this paper, we provide the first convergence result for private FL on smooth
\textit{convex} objectives \textit{for a general clipping threshold} --
\textit{without assuming Lipschitzness}. We also look at a simpler alternative
to clipping (for bounding sensitivity) which is \textit{normalization} -- where
we use only a scaled version of the unit vector along the client updates,
completely discarding the magnitude information. {The resulting
normalization-based private FL algorithm is theoretically shown to have better
convergence than its clipping-based counterpart on smooth convex functions. We
corroborate our theory with synthetic experiments as well as experiments on
benchmarking datasets.

frustum attack can be exercised consistently over time to form stealthy
longitudinal attack sequences, compromising the tracking module and creating
adverse outcomes on end-to-end AV control.

which can be exactly synthesized by a universal fault-tolerant gate set, while
others can be approximately synthesized. A quantum compiler synthesizes each
approximately synthesizable unitary up to some approximation error, such that
the error of the overall unitary remains bounded by a certain amount. In this
paper we consider the case when the errors are measured in the global phase
invariant distance. Apart from deriving a relation between this distance and
the Frobenius norm, we show that this distance composes. If a unitary is
written as a composition (product and tensor product) of other unitaries, we
derive bounds on the error of the overall unitary as a function of the errors
of the composed unitaries. Our bound is better than the sum-of-error bound
(Bernstein,Vazirani,1997), derived for the operator norm. This indicates that
synthesizing a circuit using global phase invariant distance maybe done with
less number of resources.
  Next we consider the following problem. Suppose we are given a decomposition
of a unitary. The task is to distribute the errors in each component such that
the T-count is optimized. Specifically, we consider those decompositions where
$R_z(\theta)$ gates are the only approximately synthesizable component. We
prove analytically that for both the operator norm and global phase invariant
distance, the error should be distributed equally among these components (given
some approximations). The optimal number of T-gates obtained by using the
global phase invariant distance is less. Furthermore, we show that in case of
approximate Quantum Fourier Transform, the error obtained by pruning rotation
gates is less when measured in this distance.

strategy models the players' participation in the game and is a relevant aspect
in many settings, e.g. social networks or opinion dynamics where abstention is
an option during an election. In this paper, we provide a formulation of the
OPD where we consider irrational behaviours in the population inspired by
prospect theory. Prospect theory has gained increasing popularity in recent
times thanks to its ability to capture aspects such as reference dependence or
loss aversion which are common in human behaviour. This element is original in
our formulation of the game and is incorporated in our framework through
pairwise comparison dynamics. Recently, the impact of the environment has been
studied in the form of feedback on the population dynamics. Another element of
novelty in our work is the extension of the game-environment feedback to the
OPD in two forms of dynamics, the replicator and the pairwise comparison. The
contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we propose a modelling
framework where prospect theory is used to capture irrational behaviours in an
evolutionary game with game-environment feedback. Second, we carry out the
stability analysis of the system equilibria and discuss the oscillating
behaviours arising from the game-environment feedback. Finally, we extend our
previous results to the OPD and we discuss the main differences between the
model resulting from the replicator dynamics and the one resulting from the
pairwise comparison dynamics.

Disaggregated memory uses network attached DRAM as a way to decouple memory

advantages in terms of making a larger memory capacity available as a central
pool to a collection of smaller processing nodes. To explore these
possibilities, we have implemented Farview, a disaggregated memory solution for
databases, operating as a remote buffer cache with operator offloading
capabilities. Farview is implemented as an FPGA-based smart NIC making DRAM
available as a disaggregated, network attached memory module capable of
performing data processing at line rate over data streams to/from disaggregated
memory. Farview supports query offloading using operators such as selection,
projection, aggregation, regular expression matching and encryption. In this
paper we focus on analytical queries and demonstrate the viability of the idea
through an extensive experimental evaluation of Farview under different
workloads. Farview is competitive with a local buffer cache solution for all
the workloads and outperforms it in a number of cases, proving that a smart
disaggregated memory can be a viable alternative for databases deployed in

equations (ADEs) often overlook the entropic contribution of the
discretization, e.g., the number of particles, within associated numerical
methods. Many times, the gain in accuracy of a highly discretized numerical
model is outweighed by its associated computational costs or the noise within
the data. We address the question of how many particles are needed in a
simulation to best approximate and estimate parameters in one-dimensional
advective-diffusive transport. To do so, we use the well-known Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC) and a recently-developed correction called the
Computational Information Criterion (COMIC) to guide the model selection
process. Random-walk and mass-transfer particle tracking methods are employed
to solve the model equations at various levels of discretization. Numerical
results demonstrate that the COMIC provides an optimal number of particles that
can describe a more efficient model in terms of parameter estimation and model
prediction compared to the model selected by the AIC even when the data is
sparse or noisy, the sampling volume is not uniform throughout the physical
domain, or the error distribution of the data is non-IID Gaussian.

  Sciences",,,,"cs.CV astro-ph.EP astro-ph.IM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the nature of their pathways, NASA Terra and NASA Aqua satellites
capture imagery containing swath gaps, which are areas of no data. Swath gaps
can overlap the region of interest (ROI) completely, often rendering the entire
imagery unusable by Machine Learning (ML) models. This problem is further
exacerbated when the ROI rarely occurs (e.g. a hurricane) and, on occurrence,
is partially overlapped with a swath gap. With annotated data as supervision, a
model can learn to differentiate between the area of focus and the swath gap.
However, annotation is expensive and currently the vast majority of existing
data is unannotated. Hence, we propose an augmentation technique that
considerably removes the existence of swath gaps in order to allow CNNs to
focus on the ROI, and thus successfully use data with swath gaps for training.
We experiment on the UC Merced Land Use Dataset, where we add swath gaps
through empty polygons (up to 20 percent areas) and then apply augmentation
techniques to fill the swath gaps. We compare the model trained with our
augmentation techniques on the swath gap-filled data with the model trained on
the original swath gap-less data and note highly augmented performance.
Additionally, we perform a qualitative analysis using activation maps that
visualizes the effectiveness of our trained network in not paying attention to
the swath gaps. We also evaluate our results with a human baseline and show
that, in certain cases, the filled swath gaps look so realistic that even a
human evaluator did not distinguish between original satellite images and swath
gap-filled images. Since this method is aimed at unlabeled data, it is widely
generalizable and impactful for large scale unannotated datasets from various
space data domains.

artificially produced (e.g., via adding different noise to data samples), have
proven useful in enhancing representation learning. Natural views are often
handled by multiview analysis tools, e.g., (deep) canonical correlation
analysis [(D)CCA], while the artificial ones are frequently used in
self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigms, e.g., BYOL and Barlow Twins. Both
types of approaches often involve learning neural feature extractors such that
the embeddings of data exhibit high cross-view correlations. Although
intuitive, the effectiveness of correlation-based neural embedding is mostly
empirically validated.
  This work aims to understand latent correlation maximization-based deep
multiview learning from a latent component identification viewpoint. An
intuitive generative model of multiview data is adopted, where the views are
different nonlinear mixtures of shared and private components. Since the shared
components are view/distortion-invariant, representing the data using such
components is believed to reveal the identity of the samples effectively and
robustly. Under this model, latent correlation maximization is shown to
guarantee the extraction of the shared components across views (up to certain
ambiguities). In addition, it is further shown that the private information in
each view can be provably disentangled from the shared using proper
regularization design. A finite sample analysis, which has been rare in
nonlinear mixture identifiability study, is also presented. The theoretical
results and newly designed regularization are tested on a series of tasks.

nature. This paper fills in these missing events by generating precondition
events. Precondition generation can be framed as a sequence-to-sequence
problem: given a target event, generate a possible precondition. However, in
most real-world scenarios, an event can have several preconditions, requiring
diverse generation -- a challenge for standard seq2seq approaches. We propose
DiP, a Diverse Precondition generation system that can generate unique and
diverse preconditions. DiP uses a generative process with three components --
an event sampler, a candidate generator, and a post-processor. The event
sampler provides control codes (precondition triggers) which the candidate
generator uses to focus its generation. Unlike other conditional generation
systems, DiP automatically generates control codes without training on diverse
examples. Analysis against baselines reveals that DiP improves the diversity of
preconditions significantly while also generating more preconditions.

$\sim8.1\cdot10^5$ galaxies annotated by their spin direction using a symmetric
algorithm. That makes it not just the first analysis of its kind in which the

largest dataset used for this purpose to date. The results show strong
agreement between opposite parts of the sky, such that the asymmetry in one
part of the sky is similar to the inverse asymmetry in the corresponding part
of the sky in the opposite hemisphere. Fitting the distribution of galaxy spin
directions to cosine dependence shows a dipole axis with probability of
4.66$\sigma$. Interestingly, the location of the most likely axis is within
close proximity to the CMB Cold Spot. The profile of the distribution is nearly
identical to the asymmetry profile of the distribution identified in
Pan-STARRS, and it is within 1$\sigma$ difference from the distribution profile

method of learning a robot control policy. In particular, policy search using
such non-parametric policies as Gaussian process regression can learn optimal
actions with high-dimensional and redundant sensors as input. However, previous
methods implicitly assume that the optimal action becomes unique for each
state. This assumption can severely limit such practical applications as robot
manipulations since designing a reward function that appears in only one
optimal action for complex tasks is difficult. The previous methods might have
caused critical performance deterioration because the typical non-parametric
policies cannot capture the optimal actions due to their unimodality. We
propose novel approaches in non-parametric policy searches with multiple
optimal actions and offer two different algorithms commonly based on a sparse
Gaussian process prior and variational Bayesian inference. The following are
the key ideas: 1) multimodality for capturing multiple optimal actions and 2)
mode-seeking for capturing one optimal action by ignoring the others. First, we
propose a multimodal sparse Gaussian process policy search that uses multiple
overlapped GPs as a prior. Second, we propose a mode-seeking sparse Gaussian
process policy search that uses the student-t distribution for a likelihood
function. The effectiveness of those algorithms is demonstrated through
applications to object manipulation tasks with multiple optimal actions in

outcomes at multiple scales, from the functional states of single proteins in a

distribution of these outcomes changes over time -- via external interventions
like time-varying concentrations of chemical species -- is a complex challenge.
In this work, we show how counterdiabatic (CD) driving, first developed to
control quantum systems, provides a versatile tool for steering biological
processes. We develop a practical graph-theoretic framework for CD driving in
discrete-state continuous-time Markov networks. Though CD driving is limited to
target trajectories that are instantaneous stationary states, we show how to
generalize the approach to allow for non-stationary targets and local control
-- where only a subset of system states are targeted. The latter is
particularly useful for biological implementations where there may be only a
small number of available external control knobs, insufficient for global
control. We derive simple graphical criteria for when local versus global
control is possible. Finally, we illustrate the formalism with global control
of a genetic regulatory switch and local control in chaperone-assisted protein
folding. The derived control protocols in the chaperone system closely resemble

amplitudes, through several closely interacting structures in combinatorics,
algebraic and tropical geometry.
  The generalized biadjoint scalar amplitude, introduced recently by
Cachazo-Early-Guevara-Mizera (CEGM), is a rational function of homogeneous
degree $-(k-1)(n-k-1)$ in $\binom{n}{k}-n$ independent variables; its poles can
be constructed directly from the rays of the positive tropical Grassmannian.
  We introduce for each pair of integers $(k,n)$ with $2\le k\le n-2$ a system
of generalized positive roots which arises as a specialization of the planar
basis of kinematic invariants. We prove that the higher root polytope
$\mathcal{R}^{(k)}_{n-k}$ has volume the k-dimensional Catalan number
$C^{(k)}_{n-k}$, via a flag unimodular triangulation into simplices, in
bijection with noncrossing collections of $k$-element subsets. We also give a
bijection between certain positroidal subdivisions, called tripods, of the
hypersimplex $\Delta_{3,n}$ and noncrossing pairs of 3-element subsets that are
not weakly separated.
  We show that the facets of the Planar Kinematics (PK) polytope, introduced
recently by Cachazo and the author, are exactly the $\binom{n}{k}-n$
generalized positive roots. We show that the PK specialization of the
generalized biadjoint amplitude evaluates to $C^{(k)}_{n-k}$.
  Looking forward, we give defining equations and conjecture explicit solutions
using $(\mathbb{CP}^{n-k-1})^{\times (k-1)}$ via a notion of compatibility
degree for noncrossing collections, for a two parameter family of generalized
worldsheet associahedra $\mathcal{W}^+_{k,n}$. These specialize when $k=2$ to a
certain dihedrally invariant partial compactification of the configuration
space $M_{0,n}$ of $n$ distinct points in $\mathbb{CP}^{1}$. Many detailed
examples are given throughout to motivate future work.

speaker from a multi-talker speech mixture when given a cue that represents the

video track. Visual cues are particularly useful when a pre-enrolled speech is
not available. In this work, we don't rely on the target speaker's pre-enrolled

is referred to as the auxiliary reference, to form an attractor towards the
target speaker. We advocate that the temporal synchronization between the
speech and its accompanying lip movements is a direct and dominant audio-visual
cue. Therefore, we propose a self-supervised pre-training strategy, to exploit
the speech-lip synchronization cue for target speaker extraction, which allows
us to leverage abundant unlabeled in-domain data. We transfer the knowledge

different number of particles. Hexagonal symmetry around each individual
particle is quantified using the local orientational order parameter
($|{\psi_6}|$) for all the configurations. The screened Coulomb coupling
parameter, which plays a key role in determining the thermodynamic nature of a
Coulomb cluster, is estimated using Langevin dynamics and found to be sensitive
to the number of particles present in the cluster. In addition, the process of
self-organization and the dynamics of individual particles of the cluster as it
changes from a metastable state to the ground state are examined through the
estimation of dynamic entropy. Our findings suggest an intimate link between
the configurational ordering and the thermodynamics of a strongly coupled

different time-steps on different regions of the computational grid. The LTS
schemes considered here were originally introduced by Hoang et al. (J. Comput.
Phys., Vol. 382, p.152-176, 2019), who laid out the mathematical foundation of
the methods. Here, the authors take on the task of presenting a fast, efficient
and scalable parallel implementation of these LTS methods on high performance
computing machines, with the aim to provide a recipe for other climate modeling
groups that may be interested in employing LTS algorithms in their codes. As a
matter of fact, even if MPAS is our framework of choice, our approach is
general enough and could be of interest to other groups beyond the MPAS
community. Due to their nature, LTS methods possess an inherent load imbalance
that needs to be carefully addressed in order to obtain efficient scalability.
Even more important is the far from trivial task of computing the right-hand
side terms only on specific LTS regions during the time-stepping procedure. An
inefficient handling of this task causes a drastic decay of the CPU time
performance, making the LTS algorithms practically of no use. The emphasis of
the present work is therefore on the computational and parallel aspects of the
LTS methods, whose proper handling is crucial to make the methods run faster
against existing strategies, such as for instance high-order explicit global
time-stepping schemes. This is in fact the ultimate goal of using an LTS

a large number of workers jointly learn a model without sharing their training
data. However, high communication costs could arise in FL due to large-scale
(deep) learning models and bandwidth-constrained connections. In this paper, we
introduce a communication-efficient algorithmic framework called CFedAvg for FL
with non-i.i.d. datasets, which works with general (biased or unbiased)
SNR-constrained compressors. We analyze the convergence rate of CFedAvg for
non-convex functions with constant and decaying learning rates. The CFedAvg
algorithm can achieve an $\mathcal{O}(1 / \sqrt{mKT} + 1 / T)$ convergence rate
with a constant learning rate, implying a linear speedup for convergence as the
number of workers increases, where $K$ is the number of local steps, $T$ is the
number of total communication rounds, and $m$ is the total worker number. This
matches the convergence rate of distributed/federated learning without
compression, thus achieving high communication efficiency while not sacrificing
learning accuracy in FL. Furthermore, we extend CFedAvg to cases with
heterogeneous local steps, which allows different workers to perform a
different number of local steps to better adapt to their own circumstances. The
interesting observation in general is that the noise/variance introduced by
compressors does not affect the overall convergence rate order for non-i.i.d.
FL. We verify the effectiveness of our CFedAvg algorithm on three datasets with
two gradient compression schemes of different compression ratios.

segmentation methods capture objects via bounding boxes and then perform
individual segmentation within each bounding box region. However, existing
methods can hardly differentiate the target from its neighboring objects within
the same bounding box region due to their similar textures and low-contrast
boundaries. To deal with this problem, in this paper, we propose an
object-guided instance segmentation method. Our method first detects the center
points of the objects, from which the bounding box parameters are then
predicted. To perform segmentation, an object-guided coarse-to-fine
segmentation branch is built along with the detection branch. The segmentation
branch reuses the object features as guidance to separate target object from
the neighboring ones within the same bounding box region. To further improve
the segmentation quality, we design an auxiliary feature refinement module that
densely samples and refines point-wise features in the boundary regions.

are extracted from their historical states using type-specific encoders. The
inter-agent interactions are represented with a directed edge-featured

by introducing a selective gate mechanism. And finally, the trajectories of
multi-agent are executed simultaneously. Validations using both urban and

perform self-training, pseudo labels are assigned to the samples on the target

$K_\mathrm{neg}/K_\mathrm{pos}=1.43\pm 0.07$, whereas the best-fit relation for
pressure is found to be remarkably consistent with the one-to-one relation
$P_\mathrm{neg}=P_\mathrm{pos}$, indicating that the ICM in the perturbed
regions is in pressure equilibrium. These observed features in the HIFLUGCS
sample are in agreement with the hypothesis that the gas perturbations in cool
cores are generated by gas sloshing. We also analyze synthetic observations of
perturbed cluster cores created from binary merger simulations, finding that
the observed temperature ratio agrees with the simulations,
$T_\mathrm{neg}/T_\mathrm{pos}\sim 1.3$. We conclude that gas sloshing induced
by infalling substructures plays a major role in producing the characteristic
gas perturbations in cool cores. The ubiquitous presence of gas perturbations
in cool cores may suggest a significant contribution of gas sloshing to
suppressing runaway cooling of the ICM.

collapse of a massive star or the merger of two neutron stars. We monitored the
position of the close-by gamma-ray burst GRB~190829A, which originated from a
massive star collapse, through very long baseline interferometry (VLBI)
observations with the EVN and the VLBA, involving a total of 30 telescopes
across 4 continents. We carried out a total of 9 observations between 9 and 117
days after the gamma-ray burst at 5 and 15 GHz, with a typical resolution of
few milliarcseconds (mas). We obtained limits on the source size and expansion
rate. The limits are in agreement with the size evolution entailed by a
detailed modelling of the multi-wavelength light curves with a forward plus
reverse shock model, which agrees with the observations across almost 18 orders
of magnitude in frequency (including the High Energy Stereoscopic System data
at TeV photon energies) and more than 4 orders of magnitude in time. Thanks to
the broad, high-cadence coverage of the afterglow, afterglow degeneracies are
broken to a large extent, allowing us to capture some unique physical insights:
we find a low prompt emission efficiency $\lesssim 10^{-3}$; we constrain the
fraction of electrons that are accelerated to relativistic speeds in the
forward shock to be $\chi_e<13\%$ at the 90\% credible level; we find that the
magnetic field energy density in the reverse shock downstream must decay
rapidly after the shock crossing. While our model assumes an on-axis jet, our
VLBI astrometric measurements alone are not sufficiently tight as to exclude
any off-axis viewing angle. On the other hand, we can firmly exclude the line
of sight to have been more than $2\,\mathrm{deg}$ away from the border of the
region that produced the prompt gamma-ray emission based on compactness
arguments.

An underlying idea is that local cohomology functors are higher derived
functors of colocalizations (a.k.a.~coreflections).
  Predominantly well-known facts about cohomology with supports--often under
""finitary"" conditions that obtain, e.g., under noetherian hypotheses--and its
local and global interactions with quasi-coherence and with colimits, are
reviewed from both the topological and scheme-theoretic perspectives. Some
refinements of standard results are needed to accommodate certain features
involving unbounded complexes and general systems of supports.
  An important attribute of such cohomology is ""tensor-coreflectiveness,"" in
its avatar--ultimately in the context of closed categories--as ""idempotent
pair,"" a notion which plays an important role in the sequel.
  Some basic facts about linearly topologized noetherian rings and their maps,
related to cohomology with supports, and subsumed under properties of
idempotent pairs, are brought forth; and similarly for the less-familiar

capture the causal relationship between inputs features and output labels.
However, minimizing empirical risk over finite or biased datasets often results
in models latching on to spurious correlations between the training

paper, we define and analyze robust and spurious representations using the
information-theoretic concept of minimal sufficient statistics. We prove that
even when there is only bias of the input distribution (i.e. covariate shift),
models can still pick up spurious features from their training data. Group
distributionally robust optimization (DRO) provides an effective tool to
alleviate covariate shift by minimizing the worst-case training loss over a set
of pre-defined groups. Inspired by our analysis, we demonstrate that group DRO
can fail when groups do not directly account for various spurious correlations
that occur in the data. To address this, we further propose to minimize the
worst-case losses over a more flexible set of distributions that are defined on
the joint distribution of groups and instances, instead of treating each group
as a whole at optimization time. Through extensive experiments on one image and
two language tasks, we show that our model is significantly more robust than
comparable baselines under various partitions. Our code is available at

Most data augmentations in language model pre-training are context-independent.
A seminal contextualized augmentation was recently proposed in ELECTRA and
achieved state-of-the-art performance by introducing an auxiliary generation
network (generator) to produce contextualized data augmentation for the
training of a main discrimination network (discriminator). This design,
however, introduces extra computation cost of the generator and a need to
adjust the relative capability between the generator and the discriminator. In
this paper, we propose a self-augmentation strategy (SAS) where a single
network is utilized for both regular pre-training and contextualized data
augmentation for the training in later epochs. Essentially, this strategy
eliminates a separate generator and uses the single network to jointly conduct
two pre-training tasks with MLM (Masked Language Modeling) and RTD (Replaced
Token Detection) heads. It avoids the challenge to search for an appropriate
size of the generator, which is critical to the performance as evidenced in
ELECTRA and its subsequent variant models. In addition, SAS is a general
strategy that can be seamlessly combined with many new techniques emerging
recently or in the future, such as the disentangled attention mechanism from
DeBERTa. Our experiments show that SAS is able to outperform ELECTRA and other
state-of-the-art models in the GLUE tasks with similar or less computation

identifying outlying data points in the feature space and inherently overlooks

detection problem - identifying anomalous graph objects (i.e., nodes, edges and

up with other black holes in the cluster, forming heavier and heavier black
holes in a process called hierarchical merger. The most important condition for
hierarchical merger to occur is that remnants formed by mergers are retained by
the host star cluster. Using the publicly available gravitational-wave event
database, we infer the magnitudes of kick velocities imparted to the remnant
black holes due to anisotropic emission of gravitational waves and use that to
quantify the retention probability of each event as a function of the escape
speed of the star cluster. Among the second gravitational-wave transient
catalog (GWTC-2) events, GW190814 provides the tightest constraint on the kick
magnitude with ${\rm V_{kick}}=74_{-7}^{+10}$ km/s at the 90% credible level.
We find that star clusters with escape speeds of 200 km/s can retain about 50%
of the events in the GWTC-2. Using the escape speed distributions of nuclear
star clusters and globular clusters, we find that $\sim 17$ (2) remnants of
GWTC-2 may be retained by the host star cluster if all GWTC-2 events occurred
in nuclear (globular) clusters. Our study demonstrates the importance of
folding in kick velocity inferences in future studies of hierarchical mergers.

Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and a comparison of key statistical quantities
(second-order velocity structure function, acceleration correlation function,
and root mean square acceleration) to expressions derived from Batchelor's
model as well as to direct numerical simulations (DNS) is performed. In both
approaches, Stokes' drag is treated by an approximate ``linear filter'' which
replaces the particle position entering the fluid velocity field by the
corresponding ideal tracer position. Effects of preferential concentration of
inertial particles are taken into account in terms of an effective Stokes
number that is determined from the zero crossing of the acceleration
correlation function from DNS. This approximation thus allows the modeling of
inertial particle statistics through stochastic methods and models for the
Lagrangian velocity; the particle velocity is effectively decoupled from the
particle position. In contrast to the ordinary filtering technique [Cencini et

recognition behavior of newborn chicks. Specifically, we used feature
representations derived from unsupervised deep neural networks (DNNs) as inputs
to cognitive models of categorization. We show that features derived from
unsupervised DNNs make competitive predictions about chick behavior compared to
supervised features. More generally, we argue that linking controlled-rearing
studies to image-computable DNN models opens new experimental avenues for
studying the origins and computational basis of object recognition in newborn
animals.

from a low-resolution (LR) frames. The key challenge for VSR lies in the
effective exploitation of spatial correlation in an intra-frame and temporal
dependency between consecutive frames. However, most of the previous methods
treat different types of the spatial features identically and extract spatial
and temporal features from the separated modules. It leads to lack of obtaining
meaningful information and enhancing the fine details. In VSR, there are three
types of temporal modeling frameworks: 2D convolutional neural networks (CNN),
3D CNN, and recurrent neural networks (RNN). Among them, the RNN-based approach
is suitable for sequential data. Thus the SR performance can be greatly
improved by using the hidden states of adjacent frames. However, at each of
time step in a recurrent structure, the RNN-based previous works utilize the
neighboring features restrictively. Since the range of accessible motion per
time step is narrow, there are still limitations to restore the missing details
for dynamic or large motion. In this paper, we propose a group-based
bi-directional recurrent wavelet neural networks (GBR-WNN) to exploit the
sequential data and spatio-temporal information effectively for VSR. The
proposed group-based bi-directional RNN (GBR) temporal modeling framework is
built on the well-structured process with the group of pictures (GOP). We
propose a temporal wavelet attention (TWA) module, in which attention is
adopted for both spatial and temporal features. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared
with state-of-the-art methods in both of quantitative and qualitative

critical step towards reliably labeling massive data. A recent work takes a
coupled nonnegative matrix factorization (CNMF) perspective, and shows
appealing features: It ensures the identifiability of the D\&S model and enjoys
low sample complexity, as only the estimates of the co-occurrences of annotator
labels are involved. However, the identifiability holds only when certain
somewhat restrictive conditions are met in the context of crowdsourcing.
Optimizing the CNMF criterion is also costly -- and convergence assurances are
elusive. This work recasts the pairwise co-occurrence based D&S model learning
problem as a symmetric NMF (SymNMF) problem -- which offers enhanced
identifiability relative to CNMF. In practice, the SymNMF model is often
(largely) incomplete, due to the lack of co-labeled items by some annotators.
Two lightweight algorithms are proposed for co-occurrence imputation. Then, a
low-complexity shifted rectified linear unit (ReLU)-empowered SymNMF algorithm
is proposed to identify the D&S model. Various performance characterizations
(e.g., missing co-occurrence recoverability, stability, and convergence) and
evaluations are also presented.

Space Antenna are unique probes of the nature of supermassive compact objects.
We compute the gravitational-wave signal emitted by a stellar-mass compact
object in a circular equatorial orbit around a Kerr-like horizonless
supermassive object defined by an effective radius and a reflectivity
coefficient. The Teukolsky equations are solved consistently with suitable
(frequency-dependent) boundary conditions, and the modified energy and
angular-momentum fluxes are used to evolve the orbital parameters
adiabatically. The gravitational fluxes have resonances corresponding to the
low-frequency quasinormal modes of the central object, which can contribute
significantly to the gravitational-wave phase. Overall, the absence of a
classical event horizon in the central object can affect the gravitational-wave
signal dramatically, with deviations even larger than those previously
estimated by a model-independent analysis of the tidal heating. We estimate
that EMRIs could potentially place the most stringent constraint on the
reflectivity of supermassive compact objects at the remarkable level of ${\cal
O}(10^{-6})\%$ and would allow to constrain various models which are not ruled
out by the ergoregion instability. In particular, an EMRI detection could allow
one to rule out (or provide evidence for) signatures of quantum black-hole
horizons with Boltzmann reflectivity. Our results provide motivation for
performing rigorous parameter estimation to assess the detectability of these
effects.

learn the weighted adjacency matrices in the DAG space directly. Specifically,
we first show that the set of weighted adjacency matrices of DAGs are
equivalent to the set of weighted gradients of graph potential functions, and
one may perform structure learning by searching in this equivalent set of DAGs.
To instantiate this idea, we propose a new algorithm, DAG-NoCurl, which solves
the optimization problem efficiently with a two-step procedure: 1) first we
find an initial cyclic solution to the optimization problem, and 2) then we
employ the Hodge decomposition of graphs and learn an acyclic graph by
projecting the cyclic graph to the gradient of a potential function.
Experimental studies on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method provides
comparable accuracy but better efficiency than baseline DAG structure learning

the one-loop level in the standard electroweak theory with on-shell
renormalization. The results we present in the 't Hooft-Feynman gauge are valid
for on- and off-shell quarks and for all external and internal quark masses. We
show that there exist non-decoupling effects of the internal heavy top quark in
interactions with gravity. A naive argument taking account of the quark Yukawa
coupling suggests that the amplitude of the process d --> s + graviton in the
large top quark mass limit would possibly acquire an enhancement factor
$m_{t}^{2}/M_{W}^{2}$, where $m_{t}$ and $M_{W}$ are the top quark and the
W-boson masses, respectively. In practice this leading enhancement is absent in
the renormalized amplitude due to cancellation. Thus the non-decoupling of the
internal top quark takes place at the $O(1)$ level. The flavor-changing two-
and three-point functions are shown to satisfy the Ward-Takahashi identity,
which is used for a consistency-check of the aforementioned cancellation of the
$O(m_{t}^{2}/M_{W}^{2})$ terms. Among the $O(1)$ non-decoupling terms, we sort
out those that can be regarded as due to the effective Lagrangian in which
quark bilinear forms are coupled to the scalar curvature.

fluid-saturated porous media with respect to the compressibility of the solid
skeleton, the real solid material and the fluid phase. The derivation of the
model is carried out based on the porous media theory and is consistent with
the second law of thermodynamics. In the present paper, two different sets of
independent variables are introduced to implement the coupled behavior between
the compressibility of the solid skeleton and the real solid material.
Altogether the proposed model exploits five independent variables, i.e. the
deviatoric part of the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor, the partial
density of solid phase, the density of the real solid material, the density of
the real fluid material and the relative velocity of the fluid phase.
Subsequently, the linearized version of the proposed constitutive model is also
presented and compared with some models by other authors. It is found that
Biot's model can also be derived based on the linearized version of the
proposed model, which indicates that the present work bridges the gap between
the porous media theory and Biot's model. Compared with Biot's model, the
present model can provide the evolution of the porosity by considering the
volumetric strain of the solid skeleton and the volumetric strain of the real
solid material.

is used to image quasiparticle flow around engineered electrostatic barriers in
graphene/hBN heterostructures. Measurements are performed as electrostatic dams
- defined by lateral pn-junction barriers - are broken within the graphene
sheet, and carriers move through conduction channels with physical widths that
vary continuously from pinch-off to um-scale. Local, STP measurements of the
electrochemical potential allow for direct characterization of the evolving
flow profile, which we compare to finite-element simulations of a Stokesian
fluid with varying parameters. Our results reveal distinctly non-Ohmic flow
profiles, with charge dipoles forming across barriers due to carrier scattering
and accumulation on the upstream side, and depletion downstream. Conductance
measurements of individual channels, meanwhile, reveal that at low temperatures
the quasiparticle flow is ballistic, but as the temperature is raised there is
a Knudsen-to-Gurzhi regime crossover where the fluid becomes viscous and the
channel conductance exceeds the ballistic limit set by Sharvin conductance.
These results provide a clear illustration of how carrier flow in a Fermi fluid
evolves as a function of carrier density, channel width, and temperature. They
also demonstrate how STP can be used to extract key parameters of quasiparticle

forcing a machine learning model to output an attacker-chosen class when

demonstrated in a variety of settings and against different models, the factors
affecting their effectiveness are still not well understood. In this work, we
provide a unifying framework to study the process of backdoor learning under
the lens of incremental learning and influence functions. We show that the
effectiveness of backdoor attacks depends on: (i) the complexity of the
learning algorithm, controlled by its hyperparameters; (ii) the fraction of
backdoor samples injected into the training set; and (iii) the size and
visibility of the backdoor trigger. These factors affect how fast a model
learns to correlate the presence of the backdoor trigger with the target class.
Our analysis unveils the intriguing existence of a region in the hyperparameter
space in which the accuracy on clean test samples is still high while backdoor
attacks are ineffective, thereby suggesting novel criteria to improve existing
defenses.

affecting the lives of hundreds of millions. Flood forecasting is therefore a
vitally important endeavor, typically achieved using physical water flow
simulations, which rely on accurate terrain elevation maps. However, such
simulations, based on solving partial differential equations, are
computationally prohibitive on a large scale. This scalability issue is
commonly alleviated using a coarse grid representation of the elevation map,
though this representation may distort crucial terrain details, leading to
significant inaccuracies in the simulation. Contributions: We train a deep
neural network to perform physics-informed downsampling of the terrain map: we
optimize the coarse grid representation of the terrain maps, so that the flood
prediction will match the fine grid solution. For the learning process to
succeed, we configure a dataset specifically for this task. We demonstrate that
with this method, it is possible to achieve a significant reduction in
computational cost, while maintaining an accurate solution. A reference

the high-level pretext task and low-level image inpainting, which not only help

a context-aware image inpainting model, which adaptively integrates global
semantics and local features in a unified image generator. The semantic learner

Cosmological simulations show that in massive early-type galaxies prolate

simulations. Here we made use of hydrodynamical cosmological simulations of
dwarfs galaxies with stellar mass between $3\times10^5$ and $5\times10^8$

only one system showed clear rotation around the major axis, whose culprit is a
major merger at $z=1.64$, which caused the transition from an oblate to a

gradient, reminiscent of the one measured in Phoenix and And II: this is the
outcome of the merger event that dynamically heats old, metal-poor stars, and
of the centrally concentrated residual star formation. Major mergers in dwarf

to infer the state of the parking lot given the data collected from the
University of The Witwatersrand. This paper presents an approach for a
real-time parking space classification based on Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN) using Caffe and Nvidia DiGITS framework. The training process has been
done using DiGITS and the output is a caffemodel used for predictions to detect
vacant and occupied parking spots. The system checks a defined area whether a
parking spot (bounding boxes defined at initialization of the system) is
containing a car or not (occupied or vacant). Those bounding box coordinates
are saved from a frame of the video of the parking lot in a JSON format, to be
later used by the system for sequential prediction on each parking spot. The
system has been trained using the LeNet network with the Nesterov Accelerated
Gradient as solver and the AlexNet network with the Stochastic Gradient Descent
as solver. We were able to get an accuracy on the validation set of 99\% for
both networks. The accuracy on a foreign dataset(PKLot) returned as well 99\%.
Those are experimental results based on the training set shows how robust the
system can be when the prediction has to take place in a different parking
space.

privacypreserving machine learning (PPML), and several PPML models have been
proposed based on various FHE schemes and approaches. Although the FHE schemes
are known as suitable tools to implement PPML models, previous PPML models on
FHE encrypted data are limited to only simple and non-standard types of machine
learning models. These non-standard machine learning models are not proven
efficient and accurate with more practical and advanced datasets. Previous PPML
schemes replace non-arithmetic activation functions with simple arithmetic
functions instead of adopting approximation methods and do not use
bootstrapping, which enables continuous homomorphic evaluations. Thus, they
could not use standard activation functions and could not employ a large number
of layers. The maximum classification accuracy of the existing PPML model with
the FHE for the CIFAR-10 dataset was only 77% until now. In this work, we
firstly implement the standard ResNet-20 model with the RNS-CKKS FHE with
bootstrapping and verify the implemented model with the CIFAR-10 dataset and
the plaintext model parameters. Instead of replacing the non-arithmetic
functions with the simple arithmetic function, we use state-of-the-art
approximation methods to evaluate these non-arithmetic functions, such as the
ReLU, with sufficient precision [1]. Further, for the first time, we use the
bootstrapping technique of the RNS-CKKS scheme in the proposed model, which
enables us to evaluate a deep learning model on the encrypted data. We
numerically verify that the proposed model with the CIFAR-10 dataset shows
98.67% identical results to the original ResNet-20 model with non-encrypted
data. The classification accuracy of the proposed model is 90.67%, which is
pretty close to that of the original ResNet-20 CNN model...

wavefunctions are fully determined by the root partition. However, such a
counting is unclear for general Jain states where a polynomial expansion is
difficult. Here we consider the simplest state beyond the Laughlin

further ask if the patterns in the counting of zeros extend, in at least an

deterministic strategy to slow down this decoherence process is to apply a
Gaussian squeezing transformation prior to the loss as a protective step. Here,
we propose a deterministic hybrid protection scheme utilizing strong but
feasible interactions with two-level ancillas immune to spontaneous emission.
We verify robustness of the scheme against dephasing of qubit ancilla. Our
scheme is applicable to complex superpositions of coherent states in many

partitioned into clusters that consist of nearby points in a metric space. A
recent variant, fair clustering, associates a color with each point
representing its group membership and requires that each color has
(approximately) equal representation in each cluster to satisfy group fairness.
In this model, the cost of the clustering objective increases due to enforcing
fairness in the algorithm. The relative increase in the cost, the ''price of
fairness,'' can indeed be unbounded. Therefore, in this paper we propose to
treat an upper bound on the clustering objective as a constraint on the
clustering problem, and to maximize equality of representation subject to it.
We consider two fairness objectives: the group utilitarian objective and the
group egalitarian objective, as well as the group leximin objective which
generalizes the group egalitarian objective. We derive fundamental lower bounds
on the approximation of the utilitarian and egalitarian objectives and
introduce algorithms with provable guarantees for them. For the leximin
objective we introduce an effective heuristic algorithm. We further derive
impossibility results for other natural fairness objectives. We conclude with
experimental results on real-world datasets that demonstrate the validity of
our algorithms.

studied observationally: solar equatorial Rossby waves (waves of radial
vorticity), large-scale convection, and surface flows around active regions.
Maps of horizontal flows are derived from photospheric observations by the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory
(SDO) using two different techniques: granulation tracking and local
helioseismology. First, the eigenfunctions of solar Rossby waves are measured
from helioseismic ring-diagram flow maps with a correlation method and a
spectral analysis. Down to $9$ Mm below the surface, the dependence of the
radial vorticity with radius $r$ is consistent with $r^{m-1}$, for a given
longitudinal wavenumber $m$. At the surface, the eigenfunctions are
complex-valued. The real part decreases away from the equator and switches sign
around $\pm 20-30^\circ$. The imaginary part is small, but nonzero, and may be
due to wave attenuation. This may have implications for the transport of
angular momentum in the latitudinal direction. Second, we revisit previous
measurements of power spectra of longitudinal velocities near the solar
surface, obtained from time-distance and ring-diagram helioseismology. Several
issues in these past helioseismic analyses are identified and corrected. The
corrections are not sufficient to remove the discrepancy between the
measurements. I thus present new velocity power spectra from granulation
tracking and ring-diagram helioseismology. The two new measurements are close
to each other near the solar surface, and the corresponding kinetic energy
decreases with increasing spatial scale.

For such data, we are often interested in obtaining a partition for each time
step and tracking the dynamic change of partitions. Normally, a smooth change
is assumed for data to have a temporal smooth nature. Existing algorithms
consider the temporal smoothness as an a priori preference and bias the search
towards the preferred direction. This a priori manner leads to a risk of
converging to an unexpected region because it is not always the case that a
reasonable preference can be elicited given the little prior knowledge about
the data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new clustering framework
called evolutionary robust clustering over time. One significant innovation of
the proposed framework is processing the temporal smoothness in an a posteriori
manner, which avoids unexpected convergence that occurs in existing algorithms.
Furthermore, the proposed framework automatically tunes the weight of
smoothness without data's affinity matrix and predefined parameters, which
holds better applicability and scalability. The effectiveness and efficiency of
the proposed framework are confirmed by comparing with state-of-the-art
algorithms on both synthetic and real datasets.

environments. Recent advances in efficient planning in deterministic or
stochastic high-dimensional domains with continuous action spaces leverage
backpropagation through a model of the environment to directly optimize
actions. However, existing methods typically not take risk into account when
optimizing in stochastic domains, which can be incorporated efficiently in MDPs
by optimizing the entropic utility of returns. We bridge this gap by
introducing Risk-Aware Planning using PyTorch (RAPTOR), a novel framework for
risk-sensitive planning through end-to-end optimization of the entropic utility
objective. A key technical difficulty of our approach lies in that direct
optimization of the entropic utility by backpropagation is impossible due to
the presence of environment stochasticity. The novelty of RAPTOR lies in the
reparameterization of the state distribution, which makes it possible to apply
stochastic backpropagatation through sufficient statistics of the entropic
utility computed from forward-sampled trajectories. The direct optimization of
this empirical objective in an end-to-end manner is called the risk-averse
straight-line plan, which commits to a sequence of actions in advance and can
be sub-optimal in highly stochastic domains. We address this shortcoming by
optimizing for risk-aware Deep Reactive Policies (RaDRP) in our framework. We
evaluate and compare these two forms of RAPTOR on three highly stochastic
do-mains, including nonlinear navigation, HVAC control, and linear reservoir
control, demonstrating the ability to manage risk in complex MDPs.

interest in simulating the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy. While virus
transmission is ruled by a SEIAR type compartmental model, within our approach
the population is given by a sum of commuters moving on a extra-urban scale and
non commuters interacting only on the smaller urban scale. A transport dynamic
of the commuter population at large spatial scales, based on kinetic equations,
is coupled with a diffusion model for non commuters at the urban scale. Thanks
to a suitable scaling limit, the kinetic transport model used to describe the
dynamics of commuters, within a given urban area coincides with the diffusion
equations that characterize the movement of non-commuting individuals. Because
of the high uncertainty in the data reported in the early phase of the
epidemic, the presence of random inputs in both the initial data and the
epidemic parameters is included in the model. A robust numerical method is
designed to deal with the presence of multiple scales and the uncertainty
quantification process. In our simulations, we considered a realistic
geographical domain, describing the Lombardy region, in which the size of the
cities, the number of infected individuals, the average number of daily
commuters moving from one city to another, and the epidemic aspects are taken
into account through a calibration of the model parameters based on the actual
available data. The results show that the model is able to describe correctly

number of deployed audio sensing applications that need to dynamically
incorporate new tasks and changing input distribution from users, the ability
of IL on-device becomes essential for both efficiency and user privacy.
  However, prior works suffer from high computational costs and storage demands
which hinders the deployment of IL on-device. In this work, to overcome these
limitations, we develop an end-to-end and on-device IL framework, FastICARL,
that incorporates an exemplar-based IL and quantization in the context of
audio-based applications. We first employ k-nearest-neighbor to reduce the
latency of IL. Then, we jointly utilize a quantization technique to decrease
the storage requirements of IL. We implement FastICARL on two types of mobile
devices and demonstrate that FastICARL remarkably decreases the IL time up to
78-92% and the storage requirements by 2-4 times without sacrificing its

sustainability of industrial processes, robotic assembly and disassembly have
been understudied in the existing literature. This is in contradiction to their
importance in realizing the Fourth Industrial Revolution. More specifically,
although most of the literature has extensively discussed how to optimally
assemble or disassemble given products, the role of other factors has been
overlooked. For example, the types of robots involved in implementing the
sequence plans, which should ideally be taken into account throughout the whole
chain consisting of design, assembly, disassembly and reassembly. Isolating the
foregoing operations from the rest of the components of the relevant ecosystems
may lead to erroneous inferences toward both the necessity and efficiency of
the underlying procedures. In this paper we try to alleviate these shortcomings
by comprehensively investigating the state-of-the-art in robotic assembly and
disassembly. We consider and review various aspects of manufacturing and
remanufacturing frameworks while particularly focusing on their desirability
for supporting a circular economy.

arrangements of these components determine the whole molecular properties and
characteristics. With the advent of deep learning in computational chemistry,
several studies have focused on how to predict molecular properties based on
molecular configurations. Message passing neural network provides an effective
framework for capturing molecular geometric features with the perspective of a
molecule as a graph. However, most of these studies assumed that all
heterogeneous molecular features, such as atomic charge, bond length, or other
geometric features always contribute equivalently to the target prediction,
regardless of the task type. In this study, we propose a dual-branched neural
network for molecular property prediction based on message-passing framework.
Our model learns heterogeneous molecular features with different scales, which
are trained flexibly according to each prediction target. In addition, we
introduce a discrete branch to learn single atom features without local
aggregation, apart from message-passing steps. We verify that this novel
structure can improve the model performance with faster convergence in most
targets. The proposed model outperforms other recent models with sparser
representations. Our experimental results indicate that in the chemical
property prediction tasks, the diverse chemical nature of targets should be
carefully considered for both model performance and generalizability.

theoretical values have raised the possibility that current theoretical stellar
structure and evolution models are inaccurate towards the low-mass end of the
main sequence. To explore this issue we use the CHEOPS satellite to obtain
high-precision light curves of eclipsing binaries with low mass stellar
companions. We use these light curves combined with the spectroscopic orbit for
the solar-type companion to measure the mass, radius and effective temperature
of the M-dwarf star. Here we present the analysis of three eclipsing binaries.
We use the pycheops data analysis software to fit the observed transit and
eclipse events of each system. Two of our systems were also observed by the
TESS satellite -- we similarly analyse these light curves for comparison. We
find consistent results between CHEOPS and TESS, presenting three stellar radii
and two stellar effective temperature values of low-mass stellar objects. These
initial results from our on-going observing programme with CHEOPS show that we
can expect to have ~24 new mass, radius and effective temperature measurements
for very low mass stars within the next few years.

representations of data. In the context of reinforcement learning (RL), such

information, while retaining the information necessary for control. Much of the
prior work on these methods has addressed the practical difficulties of
estimating mutual information from samples of high-dimensional observations,
while comparatively less is understood about which mutual information
objectives yield representations that are sufficient for RL from a theoretical
perspective. In this paper, we formalize the sufficiency of a state
representation for learning and representing the optimal policy, and study
several popular mutual-information based objectives through this lens.
Surprisingly, we find that two of these objectives can yield insufficient
representations given mild and common assumptions on the structure of the MDP.
We corroborate our theoretical results with empirical experiments on a

inferring object motions in the image from consecutive key-frames. In the
absence of additional information, first-order approximations, i.e. optical
flow, must be used, but this choice restricts the types of motions that can be
modeled, leading to errors in highly dynamic scenarios. Event cameras are novel
sensors that address this limitation by providing auxiliary visual information
in the blind-time between frames. They asynchronously measure per-pixel
brightness changes and do this with high temporal resolution and low latency.
Event-based frame interpolation methods typically adopt a synthesis-based
approach, where predicted frame residuals are directly applied to the
key-frames. However, while these approaches can capture non-linear motions they
suffer from ghosting and perform poorly in low-texture regions with few events.
Thus, synthesis-based and flow-based approaches are complementary. In this
work, we introduce Time Lens, a novel indicates equal contribution method that
leverages the advantages of both. We extensively evaluate our method on three

allowing the design of novel machine learning applications to preserve the

first to study PFL for saddle point problems (which cover a broader class of

consider a recently proposed PFL setting with the mixing objective function, an
approach combining the learning of a global model together with locally
distributed learners. Unlike most previous work, which considered only the
centralized setting, we work in a more general and decentralized setup that
allows us to design and analyze more practical and federated ways to connect
devices to the network. We proposed new algorithms to address this problem and
provide a theoretical analysis of the smooth
(strongly-)convex-(strongly-)concave saddle point problems in stochastic and

by their ability to estimate their states accurately. With the increasing
popularity of autonomous UAV solutions in real world applications, it is
imperative to develop robust adaptive estimators that can ameliorate sensor
noises in low-cost UAVs. Utilizing the knowledge of UAV dynamics in estimation
can provide significant advantages, but remains challenging due to the complex
and expensive pre-flight experiments required to obtain UAV dynamic parameters.
In this paper, we propose two decoupled dynamic model based Extended Kalman
Filters for UAVs, that provide high rate estimates for position, and velocity
of rotational and translational states, as well as filtered inertial
acceleration. The dynamic model parameters are estimated online using the Deep
Neural Network and Modified Relay Feedback Test (DNN-MRFT) framework, without
requiring any prior knowledge of the UAV physical parameters. The designed
filters with real-time identified process model parameters are tested
experimentally and showed two advantages. Firstly, smooth and lag-free
estimates of the UAV rotational speed and inertial acceleration are obtained,
and used to improve the closed loop system performance, reducing the controller
action by over 6 %. Secondly, the proposed approach enabled the UAV to track
aggressive trajectories with low rate position measurements, a task usually
infeasible under those conditions. The experimental data shows that we achieved
estimation performance matching other methods that requires full knowledge of
the UAV parameters.

  Methods: We developed YARARA, a post-processing pipeline designed to clean
high-resolution spectra from instrumental systematics and atmospheric
contamination. Spectra are corrected for: tellurics, interference pattern,
detector stitching, ghosts and fiber B contaminations as well as more advanced
spectral line-by-line corrections. YARARA uses Principal Component Analysis on
spectra time-series with prior information to disentangle contaminations from
real Doppler shifts. We applied YARARA on three systems: HD10700, HD215152 and
HD10180 and compared our results to the HARPS standard Data Reduction Software

  Results: On HD10700, we obtain radial-velocity measurements that present a
rms smaller than 1 m/s over the 13 years of the HARPS observations, which is 20

shifted signals. On HD215152, we demonstrated that the 1-year signal visible in
the periodogram becomes marginal after processing with YARARA and that the
signals of the known planets become more significant. Finally, on HD10180, the
known six exoplanets are well recovered although different orbitals parameters

interdependencies within output structures. When outputs are structured as
sequences, linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) are a widely used
model class which can learn \textit{local} dependencies in the output. However,
the CRF's Markov assumption makes it impossible for CRFs to represent
distributions with \textit{nonlocal} dependencies, and standard CRFs are unable
to respect nonlocal constraints of the data (such as global arity constraints
on output labels). We present a generalization of CRFs that can enforce a broad
class of constraints, including nonlocal ones, by specifying the space of
possible output structures as a regular language $\mathcal{L}$. The resulting
regular-constrained CRF (RegCCRF) has the same formal properties as a standard
CRF, but assigns zero probability to all label sequences not in $\mathcal{L}$.
Notably, RegCCRFs can incorporate their constraints during training, while
related models only enforce constraints during decoding. We prove that
constrained training is never worse than constrained decoding, and show
empirically that it can be substantially better in practice. Additionally, we
demonstrate a practical benefit on downstream tasks by incorporating a RegCCRF

structure and a large anomalous Hall effect below its Curie temperature of 177
K. We present a detailed study of its Fermi surface and examine the relevance
of the anomalous transverse Wiedemann Franz law to it. We studied Shubnikov-de
Haas oscillations along two orientations in single crystals with a mobility as
high as $2.7\times$10$^3$ cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ subject to a magnetic field as
large as $\sim$ 60 T. The angle dependence of the frequencies is in agreement
with density functional theory (DFT) calculations and reveals two types of hole
pockets (H1, H2) and two types of electron pockets (E1, E2). An additional
unexpected frequency emerges at high magnetic field. We attribute it to
magnetic breakdown between the hole pocket H2 and the electron pocket E2, since
it is close to the sum of the E2 and H2 fundamental frequencies. By measuring
the anomalous thermal and electrical Hall conductivities, we quantified the
anomalous transverse Lorenz ratio, which is close to the Sommerfeld ratio
($L_0=\frac{\pi^2}{3}\frac{k_B^2}{e^2}$) below 100 K and deviates downwards at
higher temperatures. This finite temperature deviation from the anomalous
Wiedemann-Franz law is a source of information on the distance between the
sources and sinks of the Berry curvature and the chemical potential.

frontal/profile optical illusion and present a novel two-stage approach to
solve the aforementioned dilemma, where the task of face pose manipulation is
cast into face inpainting. By selectively sampling pixels from the input face
and slightly adjust their relative locations with the proposed ``Pixel
Attention Sampling"" module, the face editing result faithfully keeps the
identity information as well as the image style unchanged. By leveraging
high-dimensional embedding at the inpainting stage, finer details are
generated. Further, with the 3D facial landmarks as guidance, our method is
able to manipulate face pose in three degrees of freedom, i.e., yaw, pitch, and
roll, resulting in more flexible face pose editing than merely controlling the
yaw angle as usually achieved by the current state-of-the-art. Both the
qualitative and quantitative evaluations validate the superiority of the

Industry applications of machine learning on streaming data become more popular

summarized in this paper surveys the state-of-the-art open-source AutoML tools,
applies them to data collected from streams, and measures how their performance
changes over time. For comparative purposes, batch, batch incremental and

address this issue, we propose a novel idea of simultaneous source number

estimation model to realize this idea, by which the source number can be
automatically identified together with DOA estimation. In particular, the
source number is properly exploited by the $l_0$ norm of impinging signals
without relaxations, guaranteeing accuracy. Furthermore, we design a

source number identification and sparse recovery are simultaneously optimized
at the on-grid (lower) level. A forward search strategy is developed to further
refine the grid at the off-grid (upper) level. This strategy does not need

methods need to solve an atomic $l_0$ norm (i.e., the continuous analog of

this problem is NP-hard to compute, relaxations of atomic $l_0$ norm, such as
nuclear norm and reweighted atomic norm, have been employed for promoting
sparsity. However, the relaxations give rise to a resolution limit,
subsequently leading to biased model order and convergence error. To overcome
the above shortcomings of relaxation, we propose a novel idea of simultaneously
estimating the frequencies and model order by means of the atomic $l_0$ norm.
To accomplish this idea, we build a multiobjective optimization model. The
measurment error and the atomic $l_0$ norm are taken as the two optimization
objectives. The proposed model directly exploits the model order via the atomic
$l_0$ norm, thus breaking the resolution limit. We further design a
variable-length evolutionary algorithm to solve the proposed model, which
includes two innovations. One is a variable-length coding and search strategy.
It flexibly codes and interactively searches diverse solutions with different
model orders. These solutions act as steppingstones that help fully exploring
the variable and open-ended frequency search space and provide extensive
potentials towards the optima. Another innovation is a model order pruning
mechanism, which heuristically prunes less contributive frequencies within the
solutions, thus significantly enhancing convergence and diversity. Simulation
results confirm the superiority of our approach in both frequency estimation

unified theory (GUT) and a $D_{4}$ flavor symmetry. This is a highly predictive
4D $SU(5)$ GUT with a flavor symmetry that does not contain a triplet
irreducible representation. The Yukawa matrices of quarks and charged leptons
are obtained after integrating out heavy messenger fields from renormalizable
superpotentials while neutrino masses originate from the type I seesaw
mechanism. The group theoretical factors from 24- and 45-dimensional Higgs
fields lead to ratios between the Yukawa couplings in agreement with data,
while the dangerous proton decay operators are highly suppressed. By performing
a numerical fit, we find that the model captures accurately the mixing angles,
the Yukawa couplings and the $CP$ phase of the quark sector at the GUT scale.
The neutrino masses are generated at the renormalizable level with the
prediction of trimaximal mixing while an additional effective operator is
required to account for the baryon asymmetry of the universe (BAU). The model
is remarkably predictive because only the normal neutrino mass ordering and the
lower octant of the atmospheric angle are allowed while the $CP$ conserving
values of the Dirac neutrino phase $\delta_{CP}$ are excluded. Moreover, the
predicted values of the effective Majorana mass $m_{\beta \beta}$ can be tested
at future neutrinoless double beta decay experiments. An analytical and a
numerical study of the BAU via the leptogenesis mechanism is performed. We
focused on the regions of parameter space where leptogenesis from the lightest
right-handed neutrino is successfully realized. Strong correlations between the
parameters of the neutrino sector and the observed BAU are obtained.

active galactic nuclei (AGNs) as factories of merging BBHs. Compact objects
evolving from massive stars are unavoidably enshrouded by a massive envelope to
form accretion-modified stars (AMSs) in the dense gaseous environment of a
supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion disk. We show that most AMSs form
binaries due to gravitational interaction with each other during radial
migration in the SMBH disk, forming BBHs inside the AMS. When a BBH is born,
its orbit is initially governed by the tidal torque of the SMBH. Bondi
accretion onto BBH at a hyper-Eddington rate naturally develops and then
controls the evolution of its orbits. We find that Bondi accretion leads to
efficient removal of orbital angular momentum of the binary, whose final merger
produces a GW burst. Meanwhile, the Blandford-Znajek mechanism pumps the spin
energy of the merged BH to produce an electromagnetic counterpart (EMC).
Moreover, hyper-Eddington accretion onto the BBH develops powerful outflows and
triggers a Bondi explosion, which manifests itself as a EMC of the GW burst,
depending on the viscosity of the accretion flow. Thermal emission from Bondi
sphere appears as one of EMCs. BBHs radiate GWs with frequencies $\sim
10^{2}\,$Hz, which are accessible to LIGO.

para- to the ferromagnetic phase across the quantum critical point at a rate
characterized by a quench time $\tau_Q$. We calculate a connected kink-kink
correlator in the final state at zero transverse field. The correlator is a sum
of two terms: a negative (anti-bunching) Gaussian that depends on the
Kibble-Zurek (KZ) correlation length only and a positive term that depends on a
second longer scale of length. The second length is made longer by dephasing of
the state excited near the critical point during the following ramp across the
ferromagnetic phase. This interpretation is corroborated by considering a
linear ramp that is halted in the ferromagnetic phase for a finite waiting time
and then continued at the same rate as before the halt. The extra time
available for dephasing increases the second scale of length that
asymptotically grows linearly with the waiting time. The dephasing also
suppresses magnitude of the second term making it negligible for waiting times
much longer than $\tau_Q$. The same dephasing can be obtained with a smooth
ramp that slows down in the ferromagnetic phase. Assuming sufficient dephasing
we obtain also higher order kink correlators and the ferromagnetic correlation
function.

careful characterisation and analysis of the TMD materials themselves is

peak-fitting, and analysis can be complex and nuanced endeavours requiring
specific expertise. To improve the availability and accessibility of reference

provide a more complete understanding of the composition and quality of the

applications, the in-air thermal stability of the TMDs was investigated after
several annealing points up to 400 {\deg}C. This delivers a trend of evolving

appearance of equilibration and thermalization becomes relevant in dealing with
finite systems. Here, we propose a new observable to study this transition in a
spin chain under the ``disorder'' of a Harper-Hofstadter-Aubry-Andr\'e on-site

a field gradient is applied before the time reversal. In the absence of
many-body interactions, the ZOGE coincides with the inverse participation ratio
of a Fermionic wave function. By adding an Ising interaction to an XY

critical region, the excitation dynamics is consistent with a diffusion law.
However, for weak disorder, quantum diffusion prevails while for strong

substantially since the advent of Automated Market Makers (AMM). Yet, AMMs and
their forks compete on the same blockchain, incurring unnecessary network and
block-space overhead, by attracting sandwich attackers and arbitrage
competitions. Moreover, conceptually speaking, a blockchain is one database,
and we find little reason to partition this database into multiple competing
exchanges, which then necessarily require price synchronization through
arbitrage.
  This paper shows that DEX arbitrage and trade routing among similar AMMs can
be performed efficiently and atomically on-chain within smart contracts. These
insights lead us to create a new AMM design, an Automated Arbitrage Market
Maker, short A2MM DEX. A2MM aims to unite multiple AMMs to reduce overheads,
costs and increase blockchain security. With respect to Miner Extractable Value
(MEV), A2MM serves as a decentralized design for users to atomically collect
MEV, mitigating the dangers of centralized MEV relay services.
  We show that A2MM offers essential security benefits. First, A2MM strengthens
the blockchain consensus security by mitigating the competitive exploitation of
MEV, therefore reducing the risks of consensus forks. A2MM reduces the network
layer overhead of competitive transactions, improves network propagation,
leading to less stale blocks and better blockchain security. Through trade
routing, A2MM reduces the predatory risks of sandwich attacks by taking
advantage of the minimum profitable victim input. A2MM also offers financial
benefits to traders. Failed swap transactions from competitive trading occupy
valuable block space, implying an upward pressure on transaction fees. Our
evaluations shows that A2MM frees up 32.8% block-space of AMM-related

from the vertex set of $G$ to $\{1,2,\dots, k\}$. If, for any vertex $u$ of
$G$, the number of neighbors $v$ of $u$ with $f(v)=f(u)$ is less than or equal
to $t$, then $f$ is called a $t$-relaxed $k$-coloring of $G$. And $G$ is said
to be $(k,t)$-colorable. The $t$-relaxed chromatic number of $G$, denote by
$\chi_t(G)$, is defined as the minimum integer $k$ such that $G$ is
$(k,t)$-colorable. A set $S$ of vertices in $G$ is $t$-sparse if $S$ induces a
graph with a maximum degree of at most $t$. Thus $G$ is $(k,t)$-colorable if
and only if the vertex set of $G$ can be partitioned into $k$ $t$-sparse sets.
It was proved by Belmonte, Lampis and Mitsou (2017) that the problem of
deciding if a complete multi-partite graph is $(k,t)$-colorable is NP-complete.
In this paper, we first give tight lower and up bounds for the $t$-relaxed
chromatic number of complete multi-partite graphs. And then we design an
algorithm to compute maximum $t$-sparse sets of complete multi-partite graphs
running in $O((t+1)^2)$ time. Applying this algorithm, we show that the greedy
algorithm for $\chi_t(G)$ is $2$-approximate and runs in $O(tn)$ time steps
(where $n$ is the vertex number of $G$). In particular, we prove that for $t\in
\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$, the greedy algorithm produces an optimal $t$-relaxed coloring
of a complete multi-partite graph. While, for $t\ge 7$, examples are given to
illustrate that the greedy strategy does not always construct an optimal

frequency regime can be obtained in the standard opacity expansion framework in
which the resulting power series diverges at the characteristic frequency
$\omega_c\sim \hat q L^2$. In the IOE, all orders in opacity are resumed
systematically below $\omega_c$ yielding an asymptotic series controlled by
logarithmically suppressed remainders down to the thermal scale $T \ll

we demonstrate that the IOE at NLO accuracy reproduces the characteristic
Coulomb tail of the single hard scattering contribution as well as the Gaussian
distribution resulting from multiple soft momentum exchanges. Finally, we
compare our analytic scheme with a recent numerical solution, that includes a
full resummation of multiple scatterings, for LHC-inspired medium parameters.
We find a very good agreement both at low and high frequencies showcasing the

to be determined for a vehicle traveling from a specified origin to a specified

for heterogeneous fuel prices in a road network. Furthermore, the path has to
comply with Hours of Service (HoS) regulations. Therefore, a path is defined by
the actual road trajectory traveled by the vehicle, as well as the locations
where the vehicle stops due to refueling, compliance with HoS regulations, or a
combination of the two. This setting is cast in a bi-objective optimization
problem, considering the minimization of fuel cost and the minimization of path
duration. An algorithm is proposed to solve the problem on a road network. The
algorithm builds a set of non-dominated paths with respect to the two
objectives. Given the enormous theoretical size of the road network, the
algorithm follows an interactive path construction mechanism. Specifically, the
algorithm dynamically interacts with a geographic information system to
identify the relevant potential paths and stop locations. Computational tests
are made on real-sized instances where the distance covered ranges from 500 to

achieving similar path durations. The average number of non-dominated paths is

learning developments that crucially deviate from standard supervised CNNs
along three axes: objective function (self-supervised, adversarially trained,
CLIP language-image training), architecture (e.g. vision transformers), and
dataset size (ranging from 1M to 1B).
  Our findings are threefold. (1.) The longstanding distortion robustness gap
between humans and CNNs is closing, with the best models now exceeding human
feedforward performance on most of the investigated OOD datasets. (2.) There is
still a substantial image-level consistency gap, meaning that humans make
different errors than models. In contrast, most models systematically agree in
their categorisation errors, even substantially different ones like contrastive
self-supervised vs. standard supervised models. (3.) In many cases,
human-to-model consistency improves when training dataset size is increased by

optimism: While there is still much room for improvement, the behavioural

  Issue: 10, Oct. 1 2021)","10.1109/TPDS.2021.3066308",,"cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper, we propose an Efficient Two-Level I/O Caching Architecture
(ETICA) for virtualized platforms that can significantly improve I/O latency,
endurance, and cost (in terms of cache size) while preserving the reliability
of write-pending data blocks. As opposed to previous one-level I/O caching
schemes in virtualized platforms, our proposed architecture 1) provides two
levels of cache by employing both Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) and SSD
in the I/O caching layer of virtualized platforms and 2) effectively partitions
the cache space between running VMs to achieve maximum performance and minimum
cache size. To manage the two-level cache, unlike the previous reuse distance
calculation schemes such as Useful Reuse Distance (URD), which only consider
the request type and neglect the impact of cache write policy, we propose a new
metric, Policy Optimized reuse Distance (POD). The key idea of POD is to
effectively calculate the reuse distance and estimate the amount of two-level
DRAM+SSD cache space to allocate by considering both 1) the request type and 2)
the cache write policy. Doing so results in enhanced performance and reduced
cache size due to the allocation of cache blocks only for the requests that
would be served by the I/O cache. ETICA maintains the reliability of
write-pending data blocks and improves performance by 1) assigning an effective
and fixed write policy at each level of the I/O cache hierarchy and 2)
employing effective promotion and eviction methods between cache levels. Our
extensive experiments conducted with a real implementation of the proposed
two-level storage caching architecture show that ETICA provides 45% higher
performance, compared to the state-of-the-art caching schemes in virtualized
platforms, while improving both cache size and SSD endurance by 51.7% and
33.8%, respectively.

processing. Due to the inherently weak optical nonlinearity and limited
interaction volume, considerable pump power is typically needed to obtain
efficient interactions to generate squeezed light in bulk crystals. Integrated
photonics offers an elegant way to increase the nonlinearity by confining light
strictly inside the waveguide. For the construction of large-scale quantum
systems performing many-photon operations, it is essential to integrate various
functional modules on a chip. However, fabrication imperfections and
transmission crosstalk may add unwanted diffraction and coupling to other
photonic elements, reducing the quality of squeezing. Here, by introducing the
topological phase, we experimentally demonstrate the topologically protected
nonlinear process of spontaneous four-wave mixing enabling the generation of
squeezed light on a silica chip. We measure the cross-correlations at different
evolution distances for various topological sites and verify the non-classical
features with high fidelity. The squeezing parameters are measured to certify
the protection of cavity-free, strongly squeezed states. The demonstration of
topological protection for squeezed light on a chip brings new opportunities
for quantum integrated photonics, opening novel approaches for the design of
advanced multi-photon circuits.

stellar eruptions known today as (luminous) red novae. The red nova outbursts
are thought to be caused by stellar mergers. The merger in V838 Mon took place
in a triple or higher system involving two B-type stars. We mapped the merger
site with ALMA at a resolution of 25 mas in continuum dust emission and in
rotational lines of simple molecules, including CO, SiO, SO, SO$_2$, AlOH, and
H$_2$S. We use radiative transfer calculations to reproduce the remnant's
architecture at the epoch of the ALMA observations. For the first time, we
identify the position of the B-type companion relative to the outbursting
component of V838 Mon. The stellar remnant is surrounded by a clumpy wind with
characteristics similar to winds of red supergiants. The merger product is also
associated with an elongated structure, $17.6 \times 7.6$ mas, seen in
continuum emission, and which we interpret as a disk seen at a moderate
inclination. Maps of continuum and molecular emission show also a complex
region of interaction between the B-type star (its gravity, radiation, and
wind) and the flow of matter ejected in 2002. The remnant's molecular mass is
about 0.1 M$_{\odot}$ and the dust mass is 8.3$\cdot$10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$. The
mass of the atomic component remains unconstrained. The most interesting region
for understanding the merger of V838 Mon remains unresolved but appears
elongated. To study it further in more detail will require even higher angular
resolutions. ALMA maps show us an extreme form of interaction between the
merger ejecta with a distant (250 au) companion. This interaction is similar to
that known from the Antares AB system but at a much higher mass loss rate. The
B-type star not only deflects the merger ejecta but also changes its chemical
composition with an involvement of circumstellar shocks.

perturbations made of white and background noises. Such disturbances are easy
to create, to perform and to reproduce, and can be accessible to a large number
of potential attackers, even non-technically savvy ones.
  We show that an adversary can focus on audio adversarial inputs to cause AED
systems to misclassify, achieving high success rates, even when we use small
levels of a given type of noisy disturbance. For instance, on the case of the
gunshot sound class, we achieve nearly 100% success rate when employing as
little as 0.05 white noise level. Similarly to what has been previously done by
works focusing on adversarial examples from the image domain as well as on the
speech recognition domain. We then, seek to improve classifiers' robustness
through countermeasures. We employ adversarial training and audio denoising. We
show that these countermeasures, when applied to audio input, can be
successful, either in isolation or in combination, generating relevant
increases of nearly fifty percent in the performance of the classifiers when
these are under attack.

Gravitational lensing boosts the source-plane resolution to $\sim0\farcs15$
$(\sim0.8\text{ kpc})$. The lensing model derived from the ALMA data is
consistent with the fiducial model in \citet{fan19} based on {\it HST} imaging.

is a compact ultra-luminous infrared galaxy, with a total star formation rate

brightness. The reconstructed velocity field of J0439+1634 appears to be
rotation-like. The maximum line-of-sight rotation velocity of 130 km/s at a
radius of 2 kpc. However, our data cannot be fit by an axisymmetric thin
rotating disk, and the inclination of the rotation axis, $i$, remains
unconstrained. We estimate the dynamical mass of the host galaxy to be
$7.9\sin^{-2}(i)\times10^{9}M_\odot$. J0439+1634 is likely to have a high
gas-mass fraction and an oversized SMBH compared to local relations. The SFR of

close to the highest value seen in any star-forming galaxy currently known in

nearly four million geotagged English tweets and the data from the CDC COVID
Data Tracker, we conducted the Fama-MacBeth regression with the Newey-West

U.S. adults were vaccine eligible to June 30, 2021, after controlling
state-level factors such as demographics, education, and the pandemic severity.
We identified the tweets related to either misinformation or fact-based news by
analyzing the URLs. One percent increase in fact-related Twitter users is
associated with an approximately 0.87 decrease (B = -0.87, SE = 0.25, p<.001)
in the number of daily new vaccinated people per hundred. No significant
relationship was found between the percentage of fake-news-related users and
the vaccination rate. The negative association between the percentage of
fact-related users and the vaccination rate might be due to a combination of a
larger user-level influence and the negative impact of online social

ideal for monitoring small signals. Its large transconductance translates small
gate voltage variations into significant changes in the drain current. However,
a current-to-voltage conversion is further needed to allow proper data
acquisition and signal processing. Low power consumption, high amplification,
and manufacturability on flexible and low-cost carriers are also crucial and
highly anticipated for targeted applications. Here, we report low-power and
high-gain flexible circuits based on printed complementary organic
electrochemical transistors (OECTs). We leverage the low threshold voltage of
both p-type and n-type enhancement-mode OECTs to develop complementary voltage
amplifiers that can sense voltages as low as 100 $\mu$V, with gains of 30.4 dB
and at a power consumption < 2.7 $\mu$W (single-stage amplifier). At the
optimal operating conditions, the voltage gain normalized to power consumption
reaches 169 dB/$\mu$W, which is > 50 times larger than state-of-the-art
OECT-based amplifiers. In a two-stage configuration, the complementary voltage
amplifiers reach a DC voltage gain of 193 V/V, which is the highest among
emerging CMOS-like technologies operating at supply voltages below 1 volt. Our
findings demonstrate that flexible complementary circuits based on printed
OECTs define a power-efficient platform for sensing and amplifying
low-amplitude voltage signals in several emerging beyond-silicon applications.

transfer order. Our method can handle the mosaicking seam lines with arbitrary

$8\rm\, M_\oplus$) orbiting a G8V host star on a 17-hour orbit. Spitzer
observations of the planet's phase curve at 4.5 $\mu$m revealed a time-varying
occultation depth, and MOST optical observations are consistent with a
time-varying phase curve amplitude and phase offset of maximum light. Both
broadband and high-resolution spectroscopic analyses are consistent with either
a high mean molecular weight atmosphere or no atmosphere for planet e. A long
term photometric monitoring campaign on an independent optical telescope is
needed to probe the variability in this system. We seek to measure the phase
variations of 55 Cnc e with a broadband optical filter with the 30 cm effective
aperture space telescope CHEOPS and explore how the precision photometry
narrows down the range of possible scenarios. We observed 55 Cnc for 1.6
orbital phases in March of 2020. We designed a phase curve detrending toolkit
for CHEOPS photometry which allows us to study the underlying flux variations
of the 55 Cnc system. We detected a phase variation with a full-amplitude of
$72 \pm 7$ ppm but do not detect a significant secondary eclipse of the planet.
The shape of the phase variation resembles that of a piecewise-Lambertian,
however the non-detection of the planetary secondary eclipse, and the large
amplitude of the variations exclude reflection from the planetary surface as a
possible origin of the observed phase variations. They are also likely
incompatible with magnetospheric interactions between the star and planet but
may imply that circumplanetary or circumstellar material modulate the flux of
the system. Further precision photometry of 55 Cnc from CHEOPS will measure
variations in the phase curve amplitude and shape over time this year.

On objects attached to positive braids $\beta$, the output is the

show that on periodic braids, the trace produces the characters of explicit

associated with late time acceleration of universe can be either stable or
saddle depending on the parameters of the theory. For some ranges of the

applications, but is currently underexplored. Although pairwise training
methods have demonstrated promise in supervised metric learning and
unsupervised contrastive learning, they remain less studied on noisy graphs,
where the structural pairwise interactions (PI) between nodes are abundant and
thus might benefit label noise learning rather than the pointwise methods. This
paper bridges the gap by proposing a pairwise framework for noisy node
classification on graphs, which relies on the PI as a primary learning proxy in
addition to the pointwise learning from the noisy node class labels. Our
proposed framework PI-GNN contributes two novel components: (1) a
confidence-aware PI estimation model that adaptively estimates the PI labels,
which are defined as whether the two nodes share the same node labels, and (2)
a decoupled training approach that leverages the estimated PI labels to
regularize a node classification model for robust node classification.

systems, is usually built on the latent factor model with learnable parameters
to predict users' preferences towards items. However, designing a proper CF
model for a given data is not easy, since the properties of datasets are highly
diverse. In this paper, motivated by the recent advances in automated machine
learning (AutoML), we propose to design a data-specific CF model by AutoML
techniques. The key here is a new framework that unifies state-of-the-art
(SOTA) CF methods and splits them into disjoint stages of input encoding,
embedding function, interaction function, and prediction function. We further
develop an easy-to-use, robust, and efficient search strategy, which utilizes
random search and a performance predictor for efficient searching within the
above framework. In this way, we can combinatorially generalize data-specific
CF models, which have not been visited in the literature, from SOTA ones.
Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that our method
can consistently outperform SOTA ones for various CF tasks. Further experiments
verify the rationality of the proposed framework and the efficiency of the
search strategy. The searched CF models can also provide insights for exploring
more effective methods in the future

constants. In this paper, we first give a new estimator of the asymptotic
relative mean square error (RMSE) of the optimal Bridge estimator by
equivalently estimating an $f$-divergence between the two densities. We then
utilize this framework and propose $f$-GAN-Bridge estimator ($f$-GB) based on a
bijective transformation that maps one density to the other and minimizes the
asymptotic RMSE of the optimal Bridge estimator with respect to the densities.
This transformation is chosen by minimizing a specific $f$-divergence between
the densities using an $f$-GAN. We show $f$-GB is optimal in the sense that
within any given set of candidate transformations, the $f$-GB estimator can
asymptotically achieve an RMSE lower than or equal to that achieved by Bridge
estimators based on any other transformed densities. Numerical experiments show
that $f$-GB outperforms existing methods in simulated and real-world examples.

in large data problems for classical solutions to the Cauchy problem of the
relativistic Euler equations. The classical theory established by P. D. Lax in
1964 (J. Math. Phys. 5: 611-614) shows that, for 2x2 hyperbolic systems, the
break-down of classical solutions occurs in finite time if initial data contain
any compression in some truly nonlinear characteristic field under some
additional conditions, which include genuine nonlinearity and the strict
positivity of the difference between two corresponding eigenvalues. These harsh
structural assumptions mean that it is highly non-trivial to apply this theory
to archetypal systems of conservation laws, such as the (1+1)-dimensional
relativistic Euler equations. Actually, in the (1+1)-dimensional spacetime
setting, if the mass-energy density does not vanish initially at any finite
point, the essential difficulty in considering the possible break-down is to
obtain sharp enough control on the lower bound of the mass-energy density. To
this end, based on introducing several key artificial quantities and some
elaborate analysis on the difference of the two Riemann invariants, we
characterized the decay of mass-energy density lower bound in time. On the one
hand, for the classical solutions with large data and possible far field vacuum
to the isentropic flow, we verified the theory obtained by P. D. Lax in 1964.
On the other hand, for the classical solutions with large data and strictly
positive initial mass-energy density to the non-isentropic flow, we exhibit a
numerical value N, thought of as representing the strength of an initial
compression, above which all initial data lead to a finite-time singularity
formation. These singularities manifest as a blow-up in the gradient of certain
Riemann invariants associated with corresponding systems.

intermediate activations. To improve the scalability of GNNs, prior works
propose smart graph sampling or partitioning strategies to train GNNs with a
smaller set of nodes or sub-graphs. In this work, we study reversible
connections, group convolutions, weight tying, and equilibrium models to
advance the memory and parameter efficiency of GNNs. We find that reversible
connections in combination with deep network architectures enable the training
of overparameterized GNNs that significantly outperform existing methods on
multiple datasets. Our models RevGNN-Deep (1001 layers with 80 channels each)
and RevGNN-Wide (448 layers with 224 channels each) were both trained on a
single commodity GPU and achieve an ROC-AUC of $87.74 \pm 0.13$ and $88.24 \pm
0.15$ on the ogbn-proteins dataset. To the best of our knowledge, RevGNN-Deep
is the deepest GNN in the literature by one order of magnitude. Please visit

convolution and exploit the self-attention operation, attaining a comparable or
even higher accuracy than CNNs. More recently, MLP-Mixer abandons both the
convolution and the self-attention operation, proposing an architecture
containing only MLP layers. To achieve cross-patch communications, it devises
an additional token-mixing MLP besides the channel-mixing MLP. It achieves
promising results when training on an extremely large-scale dataset. But it
cannot achieve as outstanding performance as its CNN and ViT counterparts when
training on medium-scale datasets such as ImageNet1K and ImageNet21K. The
performance drop of MLP-Mixer motivates us to rethink the token-mixing MLP. We
discover that the token-mixing MLP is a variant of the depthwise convolution
with a global reception field and spatial-specific configuration. But the
global reception field and the spatial-specific property make token-mixing MLP
prone to over-fitting. In this paper, we propose a novel pure MLP architecture,
spatial-shift MLP (S$^2$-MLP). Different from MLP-Mixer, our S$^2$-MLP only
contains channel-mixing MLP. We utilize a spatial-shift operation for
communications between patches. It has a local reception field and is
spatial-agnostic. It is parameter-free and efficient for computation. The
proposed S$^2$-MLP attains higher recognition accuracy than MLP-Mixer when
training on ImageNet-1K dataset. Meanwhile, S$^2$-MLP accomplishes as excellent
performance as ViT on ImageNet-1K dataset with considerably simpler
architecture and fewer FLOPs and parameters.

ecosystem services provided by wetlands. Open water mapping is an effective
means to measure any wetland extension as these are comprised of many open
water bodies. An economical, though indirect, approach towards mapping open
water bodies is through applying geo-computational methods to satellite images.
In this work we propose the flexible Beta regression (FBR) model to predict
open water fraction from measurements of a water index. We focus on
observations derived from two MODIS images acquired during the dry season of
2008 in Marismas Nacionales, a wetland located in the north-western Pacific
coast of Mexico. A Bayesian estimation procedure is presented to estimate the
FBR model; in particular, we provide details of a nested Metropolis-Hastings
and Gibbs sampling algorithm to carry out parameter estimation. Our results
show that the FBR model produces valid predictors of water fraction unlike the
standard model. Our work is complemented by software developed in the R
language and available through a GitHub repository.

graph-structured data, domain adaptation is important to supervised graph
learning tasks with limited samples. However, current graph domain adaptation
methods are generally adopted from traditional domain adaptation tasks, and the
properties of graph-structured data are not well utilized. For example, the
observed social networks on different platforms are controlled not only by the
different crowd or communities but also by the domain-specific policies and the
background noise. Based on these properties in graph-structured data, we first
assume that the graph-structured data generation process is controlled by three
independent types of latent variables, i.e., the semantic latent variables, the
domain latent variables, and the random latent variables. Based on this
assumption, we propose a disentanglement-based unsupervised domain adaptation
method for the graph-structured data, which applies variational graph
auto-encoders to recover these latent variables and disentangles them via three

stages. In the first stage, personalized aesthetic ranking is generated by
interactive image enhancement and manual ranking, meanwhile two policy networks

utilizes the manual retouching results as the optimization goals of DRL. After

alternatively to help to complete the final personalized aesthetic assessment
automatically. In the second stage, these modified images are labeled with
aesthetic attributes by one style-specific classifier, and then the
personalized aesthetic distribution is generated based on the multiple

However, a challenge with existing implicit solvent models is that they often
lack accuracy or certain physical properties compared to explicit solvent
models, as the many-body effects of the neglected solvent molecules is
difficult to model as a mean field. Here, we leverage machine learning (ML) and
multi-scale coarse graining (CG) in order to learn implicit solvent models that
can approximate the energetic and thermodynamic properties of a given explicit
solvent model with arbitrary accuracy, given enough training data. Following
the previous ML--CG models CGnet and CGSchnet, we introduce ISSNet, a graph

can learn from explicit solvent simulation data and be readily applied to MD
simulations. We compare the solute conformational distributions under different

models can outperform widely-used generalized Born and surface area models in
reproducing the thermodynamics of small protein systems with respect to
explicit solvent. The success of this novel method demonstrates the potential
benefit of applying machine learning methods in accurate modeling of solvent

quantum matter where the latter is routinely described from first-principles.
However, combining the quantized nature of light with this ab initio tool set
is challenging and merely developing, as the coupled light-matter Hilbert space
is conceptually different and computational cost quickly becomes overwhelming.
In this work, we provide a non-perturbative photon-free formulation of quantum
electrodynamics (QED) in the long-wavelength limit, which is formulated solely
on the matter Hilbert space and can serve as an accurate starting point for
such ab initio methods. The present formulation is an extension of quantum
mechanics that recovers the exact results of QED for the zero- and
infinite-coupling limit, the infinite-frequency as well as the homogeneous
limit and we can constructively increase its accuracy. We show how this
formulation can be used to devise approximations for quantum-electrodynamical
density-functional theory (QEDFT), which in turn also allows to extend the
ansatz to the full minimal-coupling problem and to non-adiabatic situations.
Finally, we provide a simple local-density-type functional that takes the
strong coupling to the transverse photon-degrees of freedom into account and
includes the correct frequency and polarization dependence. This is the first
QEDFT functional that accounts for the quantized nature of light while
remaining computationally simple enough to allow its application to a large
range of systems. All approximations allow the seamless application to periodic
systems.

equipartition theorem for a charged quantum particle moving in a harmonic

coupled to a passive quantum heat bath through coordinate variables. The bath
is modelled as a collection of independent quantum harmonic oscillators. We
derive the closed form expressions for the mean kinetic and potential energies
of the charged-dissipative-magneto-oscillator in the form $E_k = \langle
\mathcal{E}_k \rangle$ and $E_p = \langle \mathcal{E}_p \rangle$ respectively,

potential energies of individual thermostat oscillators. The net averaging is
two-fold, the first one being over the Gibbs canonical state for the
thermostat, giving $\mathcal{E}_k$ and $\mathcal{E}_p$ and the second one
denoted by $\langle . \rangle$ being over the frequencies $\omega$ of the bath
oscillators which contribute to $E_k$ and $E_p$ according to probability
distributions $\mathcal{P}_k(\omega)$ and $\mathcal{P}_p(\omega)$ respectively.
The relationship of the present quantum version of the equipartition theorem
with that of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (within the linear-response
theory framework) is also explored. Further, we investigate the influence of
the external magnetic field and the effect of different dissipation processes
through Gaussian decay, Drude and radiation bath spectral density functions, on
the typical properties of $\mathcal{P}_k(\omega)$ and $\mathcal{P}_p(\omega)$.
Finally, the role of system-bath coupling strength and the memory effect is
analyzed in the context of average kinetic and potential energies of the

$U(1)_X$. In our construction, the solutions to the important issues of
neutrino masses, dark matter and the strong CP problem are interrelated.
Neutrino masses are generated via a Dirac seesaw mechanism and are suppressed
by the ratio of the $U(1)_X$ and the $U(1)_{PQ}$ breaking scales. Naturally
small neutrino masses suggest that the breaking of $U(1)_X$ occurs at a
relatively low scale, which may lead to observable signals in near-future
experiments. Interestingly, spontaneous symmetry breaking does not lead to
mixing between the $U(1)_X$ gauge boson, $Z^\prime$, and the standard $Z$. For
the expected large values of the $U(1)_{PQ}$ scale, the associated axion
becomes ""invisible"", with DFSZ-like couplings, and may account for the observed
abundance of cold dark matter. Moreover, a viable parameter space region, which
falls within the expected sensitivities of forthcoming axion searches, is
identified. We also observe that the flavour-violating process of kaon decaying
into pion plus axion, $K^+ \to \pi^+ a$, is further suppressed by the $U(1)_X$
scale, providing a rather weak lower bound for the axion decay constant $f_a$.

out universal fault-tolerant quantum computation via single-qubit Pauli
measurements with a family of large entangled states called cluster states as
resources. Raussendorf's three-dimensional cluster states (RTCSs) based on the
surface codes are mainly considered for topological MBQC. In such schemes,
however, the fault-tolerant implementation of the logical Hadamard, phase
($Z^{1/2}$), and $T$ ($Z^{1/4}$) gates which are essential for building up
arbitrary logical gates has not been achieved to date without using state
distillation, while the controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate does not require it, to best
of our knowledge. State distillation generally consumes many ancillary logical
qubits, thus it is a severe obstacle against practical quantum computing. To
solve this problem, we suggest an MBQC scheme via a family of cluster states
called color-code-based cluster states (CCCSs) based on the two-dimensional
color codes instead of the surface codes. We define logical qubits, construct
elementary logical gates, and describe error correction schemes. We show that
all the logical Clifford gates including the CNOT, Hadamard, and phase gates
can be implemented fault-tolerantly without state distillation, although the
fault-tolerant $T$ gate still requires it. We further prove that the minimal
number of physical qubits per logical qubit in a CCCS is at most approximately
1.8 times smaller than the case of an RTCS. We lastly show that the error
threshold of MBQC via CCCSs for logical-$Z$ errors is 2.7-2.8%, which is
comparable to the value for RTCSs, assuming a simple error model where physical
qubits have $X$-measurement or $Z$ errors independently with the same

promising candidates for achieving quantum advantage through quantum-enhanced

parameters is optimized to prepare a quantum state used to find the optimal
solution of a combinatorial optimization problem. Several empirical
observations about optimal parameter concentration effects for special QAOA
MaxCut problem instances have been made in recent literature, however, a
rigorous study of the subject is still lacking. We show that convergence of the
optimal QAOA parameters around specific values and, consequently, successful
transferability of parameters between different QAOA instances can be explained
and predicted based on the local properties of the graphs, specifically the
types of subgraphs (lightcones) from which the graphs are composed. We apply
this approach to random regular and general random graphs. For example, we
demonstrate how optimized parameters calculated for a 6-node random graph can
be successfully used without modification as nearly optimal parameters for a
64-node random graph, with less than 1% reduction in approximation ratio as a

better approximation of the real spectra than those produced through a harmonic

sampler and a UV generator. By selectively sampling the input face image's
pixels and adjusting their relative locations, the UV sampler generates an
incomplete UV map that could faithfully reconstruct the original face. Missing
textures in the incomplete UV map are further full-filled by the UV generator.
The training is based on pseudo ground truth blended by the 3DMM texture and
the input face texture, thus weakly supervised. To deal with the artifacts in
the imperfect pseudo UV map, multiple partial UV map discriminators are

their $k$-mer histograms with respect to a reference genome database. CPU-based
index construction is often performed in a preprocessing phase due to the
relatively high cost of building irregular data structures such as hash maps.
However, the rapidly growing amount of available reference genomes establishes
the need for index construction and querying at interactive speeds. In this

efficient minhash fingerprinting of reads for locality-sensitive hashing and

However, the mathematics underpinning these algorithms is typically formulated
using continuous mathematics, which can result in a loss in spatial resolution

theory through experimental measurements of spatial resolution using computed

We demonstrate that if the PSF substantially suppresses high spatial

Typically, the generalization performance of CPath models is analyzed using
evaluation protocols such as cross-validation and testing on multi-centric
cohorts. However, to ensure that such CPath solutions are robust and safe for
use in a clinical setting, a critical analysis of their predictive performance
and vulnerability to adversarial attacks is required, which is the focus of
this paper. Specifically, we show that a highly accurate model for
classification of tumour patches in pathology images (AUC > 0.95) can easily be
attacked with minimal perturbations which are imperceptible to lay humans and
trained pathologists alike. Our analytical results show that it is possible to
generate single-instance white-box attacks on specific input images with high
success rate and low perturbation energy. Furthermore, we have also generated a
single universal perturbation matrix using the training dataset only which,
when added to unseen test images, results in forcing the trained neural network
to flip its prediction labels with high confidence at a success rate of > 84%.
We systematically analyze the relationship between perturbation energy of an
adversarial attack, its impact on morphological constructs of clinical
significance, their perceptibility by a trained pathologist and saliency maps
obtained using deep learning models. Based on our analysis, we strongly

reliability of biometric systems, user satisfaction is a principal factor. To
walk with the digital era, it is extremely important to assess users' concerns
about data security as the systems are conducted the authentication by
analyzing users' personal data. The study shows that users are satisfied by
using biometric systems rather than other security systems. Besides, hardware
failure is a big issue faced by biometric systems users. Finally, a matrix is
generated to compare the performance of popular biometric systems from the
users' opinions. As system reliability and user satisfaction are the focused
issue of this research, biometric service providers can use these phenomena to
find what aspect of improvement they need for their services. Also, this study

networks are single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks in which only the

Black-Scholes type PDEs, as we show here. We derive bounds for the prediction
error of random neural networks for learning sufficiently non-degenerate

that the derived bounds do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. We also
investigate an application of these results to basket options and validate the

space weather hazards is still relatively embryonic in comparison to
terrestrial natural hazards such as hurricanes or earthquakes. Indeed, certain
types of space weather such as large Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are an
archetypal example of a low probability, high severity hazard. Few major
events, short time-series data and a lack of consensus regarding the potential
impacts on critical infrastructure have hampered the economic impact assessment
of space weather. Yet, space weather has the potential to disrupt a wide range
of Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) systems including electricity
transmission, satellite communications and positioning, aviation and rail
transportation. Recently there has been growing interest in these potential
economic and societal impacts. Estimates range from millions of dollars of
equipment damage from the Quebec 1989 event, to some analysts reporting
billions of lost dollars in the wider economy from potential future disaster
scenarios. Hence, this provides motivation for this article which tracks the
origin and development of the socio-economic evaluation of space weather, from
1989 to 2017, and articulates future research directions for the field.

with space. The two major proposed simultaneity frameworks are differential
simultaneity, in which time is offset with distance in ""moving"" or rotating

is not offset with distance. We use the Mansouri and Sexl test theory to
analyze the simultaneity framework in rotating frames in the absence of
spacetime curvature. The Mansouri and Sexl test theory has four parameters.
Three parameters describe relativistic effects. The fourth parameter, $\epsilon
(v)$, was described as a convention on clock synchronization. We show that
$\epsilon (v)$ is not a convention, but is instead a descriptor of the
simultaneity framework whose value can be determined from the extent of
anisotropy in the unidirectional one-way speed of light. In rotating frames,
one-way light speed anisotropy is described by the Sagnac effect equation. We
show that four published Sagnac equations form a relativistic series based on
relativistic kinematics and simultaneity framework. Only the conventional
Sagnac effect equation, and its associated isotropic two-way speed of light, is
found to match high-resolution optical data. Using the conventional Sagnac
effect equation, we show that $\epsilon (v)$ has a null value in rotating
frames, which implies absolute simultaneity. Introducing the empirical Mansouri
and Sexl parameter values into the test theory equations generates the
rotational form of the absolute Lorentz transformation, implying that this
transformation accurately describes rotational relativistic effects.

clinical research. The results of an NMA depend critically on the quality of
evidence being pooled. In assessing the validity of an NMA, it is therefore
important to know the proportion contributions of each direct treatment
comparison to each network treatment effect. The construction of proportion
contributions is based on the observation that each row of the hat matrix
represents a so-called 'evidence flow network' for each treatment comparison.
However, the existing algorithm used to calculate these values is associated
with ambiguity according to the selection of paths. In this work we present a
novel analogy between NMA and random walks. We use this analogy to derive
closed-form expressions for the proportion contributions. A random walk on a
graph is a stochastic process that describes a succession of random 'hops'
between vertices which are connected by an edge. The weight of an edge relates
to the probability that the walker moves along that edge. We use the graph
representation of NMA to construct the transition matrix for a random walk on
the network of evidence. We show that the net number of times a walker crosses
each edge of the network is related to the evidence flow network. By then
defining a random walk on the directed evidence flow network, we derive
analytically the matrix of proportion contributions. The random-walk approach,
in addition to being computationally more efficient, has none of the associated
ambiguity of the existing algorithm.
