has found many applications in financial services ranging from fund recommender
systems, competitors analysis, portfolio analytics, marketing and sales, etc.
The traditional methods are either qualitative, and hence prone to biases and
often not reproducible, or, are known not to capture all the nuances
(non-linearities) among the portfolios from the raw data. We propose a
radically new approach to identify similar funds based on the weighted
bipartite network representation of funds and their underlying assets data
using a sophisticated machine learning method called Node2Vec which learns an
embedded low-dimensional representation of the network. We call the embedding
\emph{Fund2Vec}. Ours is the first ever study of the weighted bipartite network
representation of the funds-assets network in its original form that identifies
structural similarity among portfolios as opposed to merely portfolio overlaps.

on two sequences of graphs, denoted $\Delta_n$ and $\Gamma_n$ which are more
`symmetric' compared to the other graphs in these two families, respectively.
We prove that $(1,\sqrt{5}]$ is a gap interval for $\Delta_n$, and
$[(-1+\sqrt{17})/2,3]$ is a gap interval for $\Gamma_n$. We conjecture that
these two are indeed maximal gap intervals. As a by-product, we show that the
eigenvalues of $\Delta_n$ lying in the interval $[-3,-\sqrt{5}]$ (in

eigenvalues of $\Gamma_n$ lying in the interval $[-4,-(1+\sqrt{17})/2]$ (and in

infinity. The proofs of the above results heavily depend on the following
property which can be of independent interest: with few exceptions, all the

simple.

overall product quality, value, and consequently, producer competitiveness.
However, the existing methods have limitations. Herein, a texture sensor based

magnetized nanocomposite cilia attached to a chip with magnetoresistive sensors

of ciliary sensors in scanning fruits (blueberries and strawberries) in
different maturation stages. The contact of the cilia with the fruit skin
provided qualitative information about its texture in terms of ripeness stage.
Less mature fruits exhibited, on average, a highest peak voltage of 0.14 mV for
blueberries and 0.12 mV for strawberries, while overripe fruits exhibited 0.58

holographic QCD models possessing exact analogs in basic quantum mechanics: the
free particle, the infinite square well, and the harmonic oscillator. In
addition to making aspects of holographic QCD accessible to undergraduates,
this formulation can provide students with intuition for the meaning of curved

reduces the total number of haplotypes expected from the infinite site model

Moreover, in contrast with mutations, the number of haplotypes does not grow
linearly with the population size. We hence propose a more accurate estimate of

(ADO) method when solving the spectral approximation of the nonclassical
transport equation. The spectral approximation is a recently developed method
based on the representation of the nonclassical angular flux as a series of
Laguerre polynomials. This representation generates, as outcome, a system of
equations that have the form of classical transport equations and can therefore
be solved by current deterministic algorithms. Thus, the investigation of
efficient approaches to solve the nonclassical transport equation is of
interest and shall be pursued. This is the case of the ADO method which has
been successfully used to solve a wide class of problems in the general area of
particle transport. Numerical results are presented for two nonclassical test
problems in slab geometry. These nonclassical transport problems are chosen in
such way that their solution exactly reproduces the solution of the classical
diffusion problem. Very accurate results are obtained for both test problems.
However, the use of high precision arithmetic is sometimes required as
illustrated in the second test problem. Limitations of the spectral
approximation are also analyzed and discussed.

  in Histopathology","submitted, data available at https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/pzj5-bs61",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Purpose: In digital histopathology, virtual multi-staining is important for
diagnosis and biomarker research. Additionally, it provides accurate
ground-truth for various deep-learning tasks. Virtual multi-staining can be
obtained using different stains for consecutive sections or by re-staining the
same section. Both approaches require image registration to compensate tissue
deformations, but little attention has been devoted to comparing their
accuracy.
  Approach: We compare variational image registration of consecutive and
re-stained sections and analyze the effect of the image resolution which
influences accuracy and required computational resources. We present a new
hybrid dataset of re-stained and consecutive sections (HyReCo, 81 slide pairs,
approx. 3000 landmarks) that we made publicly available and compare its image
registration results to the automatic non-rigid histological image registration
(ANHIR) challenge data (230 consecutive slide pairs).
  Results: We obtain a median landmark error after registration of 7.1 {\mu}m
(HyReCo) and 16.0 {\mu}m (ANHIR) between consecutive sections. Between
re-stained sections, the median registration error is 2.3 {\mu}m and 0.9 {\mu}m
in the two subsets of the HyReCo dataset. We observe that deformable
registration leads to lower landmark errors than affine registration in both
cases, though the effect is smaller in re-stained sections. Conclusion:
Deformable registration of consecutive and re-stained sections is a valuable
tool for the joint analysis of different stains.
  Significance: While the registration of re-stained sections allows
nucleus-level alignment which allows for a direct analysis of interacting
biomarkers, consecutive sections only allow the transfer of region-level
annotations. The latter can be achieved at low computational cost using coarser
image resolutions.

behaviour of the exit probability $E(x_0)$, defined as the probability that a

when $z=2$, which is consistent with the conserved magnetisation in the system.

results of Chen and Zhuk, we argue that if A satisfies the polynomially

A (that is, in Inv(A)), then QCSP(B) is in NP. In doing this we study the
special forms of PGP, switchability and collapsibility, in detail, both
algebraically and logically, addressing various questions such as decidability
on the way.
  We then prove a complexity-theoretic converse in the case of infinite
constraint languages encoded in propositional logic, that if Inv(A) satisfies
the exponentially generated powers property (EGP), then QCSP(Inv(A)) is
co-NP-hard. Since Zhuk proved that only PGP and EGP are possible, we derive a
full dichotomy for the QCSP, justifying what we term the Revised Chen
Conjecture. This result becomes more significant now the original Chen
Conjecture is known to be false.
  Switchability was introduced by Chen as a generalisation of the already-known
collapsibility. For three-element domain algebras A that are switchable and
omit a G-set, we prove that, for every finite subset D of Inv(A), Pol(D) is
collapsible. The significance of this is that, for QCSP on finite structures
(over a three-element domain), all QCSP tractability (in P) explained by
switchability is already explained by collapsibility.

properties to confirm their remnant nature and revise the morphological and
spectral criteria used to define the initial sample. We present new

absence of cores and study the spectral curvature and steepness of the spectra
of the total emission expected at these high frequencies for the remnant
candidates. We confirm 13 out of 23 candidates as remnant radio sources. This
corresponds to 7% of the full sample of active, restarted, and remnant
candidates from the Lockman Hole field. Surprisingly, only a minority of
remnants reside in a cluster (23%). The remnant radio galaxies show a range of

However, there are also remnants with USS total emission and a detection of the

multipoles on mildly non-linear scales. In this work we consider a dark
scattering model with a simple 1-parameter extension to $w$CDM - adding only
$A$, which describes a pure momentum exchange between dark energy and dark
matter. We then provide a comprehensive comparison of three approaches of
modeling non-linearities, while including the effects of this dark sector
coupling. We base our modeling of non-linearities on the two most popular
perturbation theory approaches: TNS and EFTofLSS. To test the validity and
precision of the modelling, we perform an MCMC analysis using simulated data
corresponding to a $\Lambda$CDM fiducial cosmology and Stage-IV surveys
specifications in two redshift bins, $z=0.5$ and $z=1$. We find the most
complex EFTofLSS-based model studied to be better suited at both, describing
the mock data up to smaller scales, and extracting the most information. Using
this model, we forecast uncertainties on the dark energy equation of state,
$w$, and on the interaction parameter, $A$, finding $\sigma_w=0.06$ and
$\sigma_A=1.1$ b/GeV for the analysis at $z=0.5$ and $\sigma_w=0.06$ and
$\sigma_A=2.0$ b/GeV for the analysis at $z=1$. In addition, we show that a
false detection of exotic dark energy up to 3$\sigma$ would occur should the
non-linear modelling be incorrect, demonstrating the importance of the

extended Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model and random third-degree polynomial
pseudo-Boolean functions, and observe its superior performance. We also address
instances of practically relevant computational problems such as protein
folding and electronic structure calculations with problem sizes not accessible
to existing quantum annealing devices. The application of our algorithm to
protein folding and quantum chemistry problems sheds light on the shortcomings
of approximating the electronic structure problem by a PUBO problem, which, in
turn, puts into question the applicability of the unconstrained binary
optimization formulation, such as that of quantum annealers and coherent Ising
machines, in this context.

185 g, has been designed and constructed for the Recoil Directionality (ReD)
experiment. The aim of the ReD project is to investigate the directional
sensitivity of argon-based TPCs via columnar recombination to nuclear recoils
in the energy range of interest (20-200 keV$_{nr}$) for direct dark matter
searches. The key novel feature of the ReD TPC is a readout system based on
cryogenic Silicon Photomultipliers, which are employed and operated
continuously for the first time in an argon TPC. Over the course of six months,
the ReD TPC was commissioned and characterised under various operating
conditions using $\gamma$-ray and neutron sources, demonstrating remarkable
stability of the optical sensors and reproducibility of the results. The
scintillation gain and ionisation amplification of the TPC were measured to be
$g_1 = (0.194 \pm 0.013)$ PE/photon and $g_2 = (20.0 \pm 0.9)$ PE/electron,
respectively. The ratio of the ionisation to scintillation signals (S2/S1),
instrumental for the positive identification of a candidate directional signal
induced by WIMPs, has been investigated for both nuclear and electron recoils.
At a drift field of 183 V/cm, an S2/S1 dispersion of 12% was measured for
nuclear recoils of approximately 60-90 keV$_{nr}$, as compared to 18% for
electron recoils depositing 60 keV of energy. The detector performance reported
here meets the requirements needed to achieve the principal scientific goals of
the ReD experiment in the search for a directional effect due to columnar
recombination. A phenomenological parameterisation of the recombination
probability in LAr is presented and employed for modeling the dependence of
scintillation quenching and charge yield on the drift field for electron
recoils between 50-500 keV and fields up to 1000 V/cm.

Our newly developed analytic framework can provide both a qualitative and a

of this exciting compound through a combined experimental and theoretical
studies. Ho$_5$Sn$_3$ orders antiferromagnetically below $~28$ K, and shows
further spin reorientation transitions at 15 K and 12 K. We observe a sizable
amount of low-temperature magnetocaloric effect in Ho$_5$Sn$_3$ with a maximum
value of entropy change $\Delta S$ = -9.5 JKg$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ for an applied
field of $H$ = 50 kOe at around 30 K. The field hysteresis is almost zero above
15 K where magneto-caloric effect is important. Interestingly, $\Delta S$ is
found to change its sign from positive to negative as the temperature is
increased above about 8 K, which can be linked to the multiple spin
reorientation transitions. The signature of the metamagnetism is visible in the
$\Delta S$ versus $H$ plot. The magnetic ground-state, obtained from the
density functional theory based calculation, is susceptible to the effective
Coulomb interaction ($U_{\rm eff}$) between electrons. Depending upon the value
of $U_{\rm eff}$, the ground-state can be ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic.
The compound shows large relaxation (14\% change in magnetization in 60 min) in
the field cooled state with a logarithmic time variation, which may be
connected to the competing magnetic ground-states observed in our theoretical
calculations. The competing magnetic ground-states is also evident from the
small value of the paramagnetic Curie-Weiss temperature.

heterogeneous network (HetNet) supported by dual connectivity (DC) by adopting
multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as passive relays that carry
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). More specifically, RISs are
deployed under the UAVs termed as UAVs-RISs that operate over the micro-wave
($\mu$W) channel in the sky to sustain a strong line-of-sight (LoS) connection
with the ground users. The macro-cell operates over the $\mu$W channel based on
orthogonal multiple access (OMA), while small base stations (SBSs) operate over
the millimeter-wave (mmW) channel based on non-orthogonal multiple access
(NOMA). We study the problem of total transmit power minimization by jointly
optimizing the trajectory/velocity of each UAV, RISs' phase shifts, subcarrier
allocations, and active beamformers at each BS. The underlying problem is
highly non-convex and the global optimal solution is intractable. To handle it,
we decompose the original problem into two subproblems, i.e., a subproblem
which deals with the UAVs' trajectories/velocities, RISs' phase shifts, and
subcarrier allocations for $\mu$W; and a subproblem for active beamforming
design and subcarrier allocation for mmW. In particular, we solve the first
subproblem via the dueling deep Q-Network (DQN) learning approach by developing
a distributed algorithm which leads to a better policy evaluation. Then, we
solve the active beamforming design and subcarrier allocation for the mmW via
the successive convex approximation (SCA) method. Simulation results exhibit
the effectiveness of the proposed resource allocation scheme compared to other
baseline schemes. In particular, it is revealed that by deploying UAVs-RISs,
the transmit power can be reduced by 6 dBm while maintaining similar guaranteed
QoS.

shadow, but other compact objects such as naked singularities, gravastar or
boson stars can also cast shadows. An intriguing fact that has emerged is that
the event horizon and the photon sphere are not necessary for a shadow to form.
Now, when two different types of equally massive compact objects cast shadows
of same size, then it would be very difficult to distinguish them from each
other. However, the nature of the nulllike and timelike geodesics around the
two compact objects would be different, since their spacetime geometries are
different. Therefore, the intensity distribution of light emitted by the
accreting matter around the compact objects would also be different. In this
paper, we emphasize this phenomenon in detail. Here, we show that a naked
singularity spacetime, namely, the first type of Joshi-Malafarina-Narayan
(JMN1) spacetime can be distinguishable from the Schwarzschild blackhole
spacetime by the intensity distribution of light, though they have same mass
and shadow size. We also use the image processing techniques here to show this
difference, where we use the theoretical intensity data. The differences that
we get by using the image processing technique may be treated as a theoretical
template of intensity differences, which may be useful to analyse the
observational data of the image of a compact object.

identifying morphed face images. The core of our framework is that artifacts
resulting from the morphing process that are not discernible in the image
domain can be more easily identified in the spatial frequency domain. A
discriminative wavelet sub-band can accentuate the disparity between a real and
a morphed image. To this end, multi-level DWT is applied to all images,
yielding 48 mid and high-frequency sub-bands each. The entropy distributions
for each sub-band are calculated separately for both bona fide and morph
images. For some of the sub-bands, there is a marked difference between the
entropy of the sub-band in a bona fide image and the identical sub-band's
entropy in a morphed image. Consequently, we employ Kullback-Liebler Divergence
(KLD) to exploit these differences and isolate the sub-bands that are the most
discriminative. We measure how discriminative a sub-band is by its KLD value
and the 22 sub-bands with the highest KLD values are chosen for network
training. Then, we train a deep Siamese neural network using these 22 selected
sub-bands for differential morph attack detection. We examine the efficacy of
discriminative wavelet sub-bands for morph attack detection and show that a

estimators of optimal transport costs. It is well known that an empirical
measure comprising independent samples from an absolutely continuous
distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d$ converges to that distribution at the rate
$n^{-1/d}$ in Wasserstein distance, which can be used to prove that plug-in
estimators of many optimal transport costs converge at this same rate. However,
we show that when the cost is smooth, this analysis is loose: plug-in
estimators based on empirical measures converge quadratically faster, at the
rate $n^{-2/d}$. As a corollary, we show that the Wasserstein distance between
two distributions is significantly easier to estimate when the measures are far
apart. We also prove lower bounds, showing not only that our analysis of the
plug-in estimator is tight, but also that no other estimator can enjoy
significantly faster rates of convergence uniformly over all pairs of measures.
Our proofs rely on empirical process theory arguments based on tight control of
$L^2$ covering numbers for locally Lipschitz and semi-concave functions. As a
byproduct of our proofs, we derive $L^\infty$ estimates on the displacement
induced by the optimal coupling between any two measures satisfying suitable

variability on the stellar rotation period) can be explained by utilising the
solar paradigm, in particular the physical concepts of brightness variations
learnt from the Sun. The goal of this work is to find out, through comparison
of observational and simulated data, if any physical concepts of solar
brightness variability have to be altered to reproduce the distribution of
Sun-like stars variabilities.

liquid-liquid critical point. In this sense, we apply a neural network (NN)
algorithm to analyze the phase behavior of a core-softened mixture of
core-softened CSW fluids that have liquid polymorphism and liquid-liquid

correlation length that shows power-law growth with time $\xi(t)\propto

decays as a power law $r^{-\alpha_d}$ with distance $r$ when $r\ll \xi(t)$. The

Gibbs state, or MMAS, and the decay exponent $\alpha_d$ differentiates between
a trivial MMAS ($\alpha_d=0$), as expected in the droplet picture of spin

$\alpha_d$ even in the regime $\sigma >2/3$ which corresponds to short-range

follows the RSB prediction for the decay exponent $\alpha_s = 3 - 4 \sigma$ of
the static metastate, consistent with a conjectured statics-dynamics relation,

salt and spinel-exclusive reflections reveals that first, the iron oxide film
grows with $\mathrm{Fe_{1-\delta}O}$ rock salt structure with exclusive
occupation of octahedral lattice sites. When this film is 1.1$\,$nm thick, the
further growth of the iron oxide film proceeds in the inverse spinel structure,
with both octahedral and tetrahedral lattice sites being occupied. In addition,
iron oxide on $\mathrm{SrTiO_3(001)}$ initially grows with none of these

is 1.5$\,$nm thick. This is confirmed by tr-HAXPES data obtained during growth
of iron oxide on $\mathrm{SrTiO_3(001)}$, which demonstrate an excess of

the soft thermal component is extended on the scale of the galaxy host, the
hard X-ray emission within the narrow photon energy range 6.0--7.0\,keV
originates within the unresolved core (effectively the central kpc radius). The
line is therefore indicative of the X-ray reflection from a cold neutral gas in

decreases with increasing ionic strength, but recent experiments have found
that the screening length can instead increase in concentrated electrolytes.
This phenomenon, referred to as underscreening, is believed to result from
ion-ion correlations and short-range forces such as excluded volume
interactions among ions. We use Brownian Dynamics to simulate a version of the
Restrictive Primitive Model for electrolytes over a wide range of ion
concentrations, ionic strengths, and ion excluded volume radii for binary
electrolytes. We measure the decay of the charge-charge correlation among ions
in the bulk, and compare it against scaling trends found experimentally and
determined in certain weak coupling theories of ion-ion correlation. Moreover,
we find that additional large scale ion structures emerge at high
concentrations. In this regime, the frequency of oscillations computed from the
charge-charge correlation function is not dominated by electrostatic
interactions but rather by excluded volume interactions and with oscillation
periods on the order of the ion diameter. We also find that the nearest
neighbor correlation of ions sharing the same charge transitions from negative
at small concentrations to positive at high concentrations, representing the
formation of small, like-charge ion clusters. We conclude that the increase in
local charge density due to the formation of these clusters and the topological
constraints of macroscopic charged surfaces can help explain the degree of
underscreening observed experimentally.

Background (CMB) temperature gradient field as a signature for a multiply
connected nature of the Universe. CMB simulations of a spatially infinite
universe model within the paradigm of the standard cosmological model present
non-zero two-point correlations at any angular scale. This is in contradiction
with the extreme suppression of correlations at scales above $60^{\circ}$ in
the observed CMB maps. Universe models with spatially multiply connected
topology contain typically a discrete spectrum of the Laplacian with a specific
wave-length cut-off and thus lead to a suppression of the correlations at large
angular scales, as observed in the CMB (in general there can be also an
additional continuous spectrum). Among the simplest examples are 3-dimensional
tori which possess only a discrete spectrum. To date, the universe models with
non-trivial topology such as the toroidal space are the only models that
possess a two-point correlation function showing a similar behaviour as the one
derived from the observed Planck CMB maps. In this work it is shown that the
normalized standard deviation of the CMB temperature gradient field does
hierarchically detect the change in size of the cubic 3-torus, if the volume of
the Universe is smaller than $\simeq 2.5 \cdot 10^3$ Gpc$^3$. It is also shown
that the variance of the temperature gradient of the Planck maps is consistent
with the median value of simulations within the standard cosmological model.
All flat tori are globally homogeneous, but are globally anisotropic. However,
this study also presents a test showing a level of homogeneity and isotropy of
all the CMB map ensembles for the different torus sizes considered that are
nearly at the same weak level of anisotropy revealed by the CMB in the standard
cosmological model.

traditional methods that directly aggregating the model parameters, we leverage
generative adversarial learning to aggregate the knowledge from all the local

performance, we develop a novel dual model architecture: a primary model learns
the desired task, and an auxiliary ""generative replay model"" allows aggregating
knowledge from the heterogenous clients. The auxiliary model is then
broadcasted to the central sever, to regulate the training of primary model
with an unbiased target distribution. Experimental results demonstrate the
capability of the proposed method in handling heterogeneous data across
institutions. On highly heterogeneous data partitions, our model achieves
~4.88% improvement in the prediction accuracy on a diabetic retinopathy

form an arc in the complex energy plane, which is the manifestation of the
disorder-driven dynamical phase transition. At the phase transition, the
localized corner modes and bulk modes characterized by trivial Hamiltonian
coexist within the single-band but are separated in the complex energy plane.
This behavior is analogous to the mobility edge phenomena in the disordered

$x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ such that $Ax = b$. The current best algorithms for
solving dense linear systems reduce the problem to matrix multiplication, and
run in time $O(n^{\omega})$. We consider the problem of finding
$\varepsilon$-approximate solutions to linear systems with respect to the

approximately solving linear systems with respect to the $L_p$-norm, for $p

Universe with weak gravitational lensing is a prime goal of several current and
forthcoming galaxy surveys. The power that weak lensing has to constrain
cosmological parameters can be enhanced by considering statistics beyond
second-order shear correlation functions or power spectra. One such
higher-order probe that has proven successful in observational data is the
density split statistics (DSS), in which one analyses the mean shear profiles
around points that are classified according to their foreground galaxy density.
In this paper, we generalise the most accurate DSS model to allow for a broad
class of angular filter functions used for the classification of the different
local density regions. This approach is motivated by earlier findings showing
that an optimised filter can provide tighter constraints on model parameters
compared to the standard top-hat case. We build on large deviation theory
approaches and approximations thereof to model the matter density PDF, and on
perturbative calculations of higher-order moments of the density field. The
novel addition relies on the generalisation of these previously employed
calculations to allow for general filter functions and is validated on several
sets of numerical simulations. The revised model fits well the simulation
measurements, with a residual systematic offset that is small compared to the
statistical accuracy of current weak lensing surveys. The accuracy of the model
is slightly lower for a compensated filter than for a non-negative filter
function, and that it increases with the filter size. Using a Fisher matrix
approach, we find constraints comparable to the commonly used two-point cosmic
shear measures. Hence, our DSS model can be used in competitive analyses of
current cosmic shear data, while it may need refinements for forthcoming
lensing surveys.

Consequently, the widely used two-point correlation function is not adequate

statistics beyond correlation functions, the spherical contact (or equivalently
void function), and nearest neighbour distribution function seem promising
tools to probe matter distribution in non-linear regime. In this work, we use
halos from cosmological N-body simulations, galaxy groups from the
volume-limited galaxy group and central galaxies from mock galaxy catalogues,
to compare the spherical contact with the nearest neighbour distribution
functions. We also calculate the J-function (or equivalently the first
conditional correlation function), for different samples. Moreover, we consider
the redshift evolution and mass-scale dependence of statistics in the
simulations and dependence on the magnitude of volume-limited samples in group
catalogues as well as the mock central galaxies. The shape of the spherical
contact probability distribution function is nearly skew-normal, with skewness
and kurtosis being approximately 0.5 and 3, respectively. On the other hand,
the nearest neighbour probability distribution function is nearly log-normal,
with logarithmic skewness and kurtosis being approximately 0.1 and 2.5,
respectively. Accordingly, the spherical contact distribution function probes
larger scales compared to the nearest neighbour distribution function, which is
influenced by details of structures. We also find a linear relation between the

estimation branch (""ADE""), aiming to regress the depth maps. We find that ""ADE""

introduce a multi-modal confidence-aware loss function via a generative
adversarial network to weigh the contribution of depth for camouflaged object
detection. Our extensive experiments on various camouflaged object detection
datasets explain that the existing ""sensor depth"" based RGB-D segmentation

behaviours of many statistical mechanics models on Euclidean lattices depend
only on the dimension and not on the specific choice of lattice. We investigate
the extent to which this universality continues to hold beyond the Euclidean
setting, taking as case studies Bernoulli bond percolation and lattice trees.
We present strong numerical evidence that the critical exponents governing
these models on transitive graphs of polynomial volume growth depend only on
the volume-growth dimension of the graph and not on any other large-scale
features of the geometry. For example, our results strongly suggest that
percolation, which has upper-critical dimension six, has the same critical
exponents on the four-dimensional hypercubic lattice $\mathbb{Z}^4$ and the
Heisenberg group despite the distinct large-scale geometries of these two
lattices preventing the relevant percolation models from sharing a common
scaling limit.
  On the other hand, we also show that no such universality should be expected
to hold on fractals, even if one allows the exponents to depend on a large
number of standard fractal dimensions. Indeed, we give natural examples of two
fractals which share Hausdorff, spectral, topological, and topological
Hausdorff dimensions but exhibit distinct numerical values of the percolation
Fisher exponent $\tau$. This gives strong evidence against a conjecture of
Balankin et al. [Phys. Lett. A 2018].

orders subspaces of the variational equation in a directional manner, allowing
the stability of perturbation modes to be analyzed in sequence. We show that

through the use of a learned deformation field mapping from coordinates in each
input image into a canonical template coordinate space. However, these
deformation-based approaches struggle to model changes in topology, as
topological changes require a discontinuity in the deformation field, but these
deformation fields are necessarily continuous. We address this limitation by
lifting NeRFs into a higher dimensional space, and by representing the 5D
radiance field corresponding to each individual input image as a slice through
this ""hyper-space"". Our method is inspired by level set methods, which model
the evolution of surfaces as slices through a higher dimensional surface. We
evaluate our method on two tasks: (i) interpolating smoothly between ""moments"",
i.e., configurations of the scene, seen in the input images while maintaining
visual plausibility, and (ii) novel-view synthesis at fixed moments. We show
that our method, which we dub HyperNeRF, outperforms existing methods on both

interpolation and 8.6% for novel-view synthesis, as measured by LPIPS.

planet searches for hot Jupiters around metal-poor stars, they have been

eV) bosons is an alternative to standard, collisionless Cold Dark Matter (CDM)
that is CDM-like on large scales but inhibits small-scale structure formation.
As a Bose-Einstein condensate, its free-field (""fuzzy"") limit (FDM) suppresses
structure below the de Broglie wavelength, $\lambda_\text{deB}$, creating
virialized haloes with central cores of radius $\sim\lambda_\text{deB}$,
surrounded by CDM-like envelopes, and a halo mass function (HMF) with a sharp
cut-off on small scales. With a strong enough repulsive self-interaction (SI),
structure is inhibited, instead, below the Thomas-Fermi (TF) radius,
$R_\text{TF}$ (the size of an SI-pressure-supported ($n=1$)-polytrope), when
$R_\text{TF} > \lambda_\text{deB}$. Previously, we developed tools to describe
SFDM dynamics on scales above $\lambda_\text{deB}$ and showed that SFDM-TF
haloes formed by Jeans-unstable collapse from non-cosmological initial
conditions have $R_\text{TF}$-sized cores, surrounded by CDM-like envelopes.
Revisiting SFDM-TF in the cosmological context, we simulate halo formation by
cosmological infall and collapse, and derive its transfer function from linear
perturbation theory to produce cosmological initial conditions and predict
statistical measures of structure formation, such as the HMF. Since FDM and
SFDM-TF transfer functions both have small-scale cut-offs, we can align them to
let observational constraints on FDM proxy for SFDM-TF, finding FDM with
particle masses $1 \lesssim m/(10^{-22} \text{ eV}/c^2) \lesssim 30$
corresponds to SFDM-TF with $10 \gtrsim R_\text{TF}/(1 \text{ pc}) \gtrsim 1$,
favoring sub-galactic (sub-kpc) core-size. The SFDM-TF HMF cuts off gradually,
however, leaving more small-mass haloes: its Jeans mass shrinks so fast, scales
filtered early can still recover and grow!

Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) have shown that dust
continuum emission generally occurs in compact regions smaller than the stellar
distribution. However, it remains to be understood how systematic these
findings are. Studies often lack homogeneity in the sample selection, target
discontinuous areas with inhomogeneous sensitivities, and suffer from modest
$uv$ coverage coming from single array configurations. GOODS-ALMA is a 1.1mm
galaxy survey over a continuous area of 72.42arcmin$^2$ at a homogeneous
sensitivity. In this version 2.0, we present a new low resolution dataset and
its combination with the previous high resolution dataset from the survey,
improving the $uv$ coverage and sensitivity reaching an average of $\sigma =
68.4\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. A total of 88 galaxies are detected in a blind search
(compared to 35 in the high resolution dataset alone), 50% at $S/N_{peak} \geq
5$ and 50% at $3.5 \leq S/N_{peak} \leq 5$ aided by priors. Among them, 13 out
of the 88 are optically dark or faint sources ($H$- or $K$-band dropouts). The
sample dust continuum sizes at 1.1mm are generally compact, with a median
effective radius of $R_{e} = 0""10 \pm 0""05$ (a physical size of $R_{e} = 0.73
\pm 0.29$kpc at the redshift of each source). Dust continuum sizes evolve with
redshift and stellar mass resembling the trends of the stellar sizes measured
at optical wavelengths, albeit a lower normalization compared to those of
late-type galaxies. We conclude that for sources with flux densities $S_{1.1mm}
> 1$mJy, compact dust continuum emission at 1.1mm prevails, and sizes as
extended as typical star-forming stellar disks are rare. The $S_{1.1mm} < 1$mJy
sources appear slightly more extended at 1.1mm, although they are still
generally compact below the sizes of typical star-forming stellar disks.

KM3NeT/ARCA with 6 years of observation. Moreover, most of the nearby galaxies

generally not accounted for these mistakes, instead modeling agents as mostly
optimal in achieving their goals. As a result, they are unable to explain
phenomena like locking oneself out of one's house, or losing a game of chess.
Here, we extend the Bayesian Theory of Mind framework to model boundedly
rational agents who may have mistaken goals, plans, and actions. We formalize
this by modeling agents as probabilistic programs, where goals may be confused
with semantically similar states, plans may be misguided due to
resource-bounded planning, and actions may be unintended due to execution
errors. We present experiments eliciting human goal inferences in two domains:
(i) a gridworld puzzle with gems locked behind doors, and (ii) a block-stacking

generalizing across domains. These findings indicate the importance of modeling
others as bounded agents, in order to account for the full richness of human

gaseous environment is crucial since at sub-parsec scales the binary is too
wide for gravitational wave emission to take over and to drive the two black
holes to merge. We here investigate the interaction between a massive black
hole binary and a self-gravitating circumbinary disc using 3D smoothed particle
hydrodynamics simulations. We find that, when the disc self-gravity regulates
the angular momentum transport, the binary semi-major axis decreases regardless
the choice of disc masses and temperatures, within the range we explored. In
particular, we find that the disc initial temperature (hence the disc aspect
ratio) has little effect on the evolution of the binary since discs with the
same mass self-regulate towards the same temperature. Initially warmer discs
cause the binary to shrink on a slightly shorter timescale until the disc has
reached the self-regulated equilibrium temperature. More massive discs drive
the binary semi-major axis to decrease at a faster pace compared to less
massive discs and result in faster binary eccentricity growth even after the
initial-condition-dependent transient evolution. Finally we investigate the
effect that the initial cavity size has on the binary-disc interaction and we
find that, in the self-gravitating regime, an initially smaller cavity leads to
a much faster binary shrinking, as expected. Our results are especially
important for very massive black hole binaries such as those in the PTA band,
for which gas self gravity cannot be neglected.

AKER builds upon the Access Control Wrapper (ACW) -- a high performance and
easy-to-integrate hardware module that dynamically manages access to shared

throughout the SoC, wrapping controller IP cores, and configuring the ACWs to
perform local access control. To ensure the access control system is
functioning correctly and securely, AKER provides a property-driven security
verification using MITRE common weakness enumerations. AKER verifies the SoC
access control at the IP level to ensure the absence of bugs in the
functionalities of the ACW module, at the firmware level to confirm the secure
operation of the ACW when integrated with a hardware root-of-trust (HRoT), and
at the system level to evaluate security threats due to the interactions among
shared resources. The performance, resource usage, and security of access

Distill-and-Select (DnS), that starting from a well-performing fine-grained
Teacher Network learns: a) Student Networks at different retrieval performance
and computational efficiency trade-offs and b) a Selector Network that at test
time rapidly directs samples to the appropriate student to maintain both high
retrieval performance and high computational efficiency. We train several
students with different architectures and arrive at different trade-offs of

fine-grained students that store/index videos using binary representations.
Importantly, the proposed scheme allows Knowledge Distillation in large,

that our students achieve state-of-the-art performance in several cases and b)

Following a review of the different formulations, simulation results obtained

quantum bounds on transport coefficients (viscosity) and chaos (Lyapunov
exponent), relevant at low temperatures. The interest comes from the fact that
Black-Hole models seem to saturate all of them. The goal of this work is to
gain physical intuition about the quantum mechanisms that enforce these bounds
on simple models. To this aim, we consider classical and quantum free dynamics
on curved manifolds. These systems exhibit chaos up to the lowest temperatures
and - as we discuss - they violate the bounds in the classical limit. First of
all, we show that the quantum dimensionless viscosity and the Lyapunov exponent
only depend on the de Broglie length and a geometric length-scale, thus
establishing the scale at which quantum effects become relevant. Then, we focus
on the bound on the Lyapunov exponent and identify three different ways in
which quantum effects arise in practice. We illustrate our findings on a toy
model given by the surface of constant negative curvature - a paradigmatic
model of quantum chaos - glued to a cylinder. By exact solution and numerical
investigations, we show how the chaotic behaviour is limited by the quantum
effects of the curvature itself. Interestingly, we find that at the lowest
energies the bound to chaos is dominated by the longest length scales, and it
is therefore a collective effect.

explore novel objectives for one-class learning, which we collectively refer to
as Generalized One-class Discriminative Subspaces (GODS). Our key idea is to
learn a pair of complementary classifiers to flexibly bound the one-class data
distribution, where the data belongs to the positive half-space of one of the
classifiers in the complementary pair and to the negative half-space of the
other. To avoid redundancy while allowing non-linearity in the classifier
decision surfaces, we propose to design each classifier as an orthonormal frame
and seek to learn these frames via jointly optimizing for two conflicting
objectives, namely: i) to minimize the distance between the two frames, and ii)
to maximize the margin between the frames and the data. The learned orthonormal
frames will thus characterize a piecewise linear decision surface that allows
for efficient inference, while our objectives seek to bound the data within a
minimal volume that maximizes the decision margin, thereby robustly capturing
the data distribution. We explore several variants of our formulation under
different constraints on the constituent classifiers, including kernelized
feature maps. We demonstrate the empirical benefits of our approach via
experiments on data from several applications in computer vision, such as
anomaly detection in video sequences, human poses, and human activities. We
also explore the generality and effectiveness of GODS for non-vision tasks via
experiments on several UCI datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art results.

learning (ML) has been gaining popularity in HIF detection because ML
techniques learn patterns from data and successfully detect HIFs. However, as
these methods are based on supervised learning, they fail to reliably detect
any scenario, fault or non-fault, not present in the training data.
Consequently, this paper takes advantage of unsupervised learning and proposes
a convolutional autoencoder framework for HIF detection (CAE-HIFD). Contrary to
the conventional autoencoders that learn from normal behavior, the
convolutional autoencoder (CAE) in CAE-HIFD learns only from the HIF signals
eliminating the need for presence of diverse non-HIF scenarios in the CAE
training. CAE distinguishes HIFs from non-HIF operating conditions by employing
cross-correlation. To discriminate HIFs from transient disturbances such as
capacitor or load switching, CAE-HIFD uses kurtosis, a statistical measure of
the probability distribution shape. The performance evaluation studies
conducted using the IEEE 13-node test feeder indicate that the CAE-HIFD
reliably detects HIFs, outperforms the state-of-the-art HIF detection

review focuses attention on promising and interesting science, it also
encourages scientists to pursue some questions at the expense of others. Here,
we use ideas from forecasting assessment to examine how two modes of peer
review -- ex ante review of proposals for future work and ex post review of
completed science -- motivate scientists to favor some questions instead of
others. Our main result is that ex ante and ex post peer review push
investigators toward distinct sets of scientific questions. This tension arises
because ex post review allows an investigator to leverage her own scientific
beliefs to generate results that others will find surprising, whereas ex ante
review does not. Moreover, ex ante review will favor different research
questions depending on whether reviewers rank proposals in anticipation of
changes to their own personal beliefs, or to the beliefs of their peers. The
tension between ex ante and ex post review puts investigators in a bind,
because most researchers need to find projects that will survive both. By
unpacking the tension between these two modes of review, we can understand how
they shape the landscape of science and how changes to peer review might shift
scientific activity in unforeseen directions.

remains a challenge. This is largely attributed to shifts in data statistics
(domain shifts) between source and unseen domains. Recently, gradient-based
meta-learning approaches where the training data are split into meta-train and
meta-test sets to simulate and handle the domain shifts during training have
shown improved generalisation performance. However, the current fully
supervised meta-learning approaches are not scalable for medical image
segmentation, where large effort is required to create pixel-wise annotations.
Meanwhile, in a low data regime, the simulated domain shifts may not
approximate the true domain shifts well across source and unseen domains. To
address this problem, we propose a novel semi-supervised meta-learning
framework with disentanglement. We explicitly model the representations related
to domain shifts. Disentangling the representations and combining them to
reconstruct the input image allows unlabeled data to be used to better
approximate the true domain shifts for meta-learning. Hence, the model can
achieve better generalisation performance, especially when there is a limited
amount of labeled data. Experiments show that the proposed method is robust on
different segmentation tasks and achieves state-of-the-art generalisation
performance on two public benchmarks.

orbital periods less than 2-3 hours can come into contact due to gravitational
waves and transfer mass from the sdB star to the WD before the sdB star ceases
nuclear burning and contracts to become a WD. Motivated by the growing class of
observed systems in this category, we study the phases of mass transfer in
these systems. We find that because the residual outer hydrogen envelope
accounts for a large fraction of an sdB star's radius, sdB stars can spend a
significant amount of time ($\sim$10s of Myr) transferring this small amount of
material at low rates ($\sim 10^{-10}$-$10^{-9}\ M_\odot\,\rm yr^{-1}$) before
transitioning to a phase where the bulk of their He transfers at much faster
rates ($\gtrsim 10^{-8}\ M_\odot\,\rm yr^{-1}$). These systems therefore spend
a surprising amount of time with Roche-filling sdB donors at orbital periods
longer than the range associated with He star models without an envelope. We
predict that the envelope transfer phase should be detectable by searching for
ellipsoidal modulation of Roche-filling objects with $P_{\rm orb}=30$-$100$ min
and $T_{\rm eff}=20{,}000$-$30{,}000$ K, and that many ($\geq$10) such systems
may be found in the Galactic plane after accounting for reddening. We also
argue that many of these systems may go through a phase of He transfer that
matches the signatures of AM CVn systems, and that some AM CVn systems
associated with young stellar populations likely descend from this channel.

obtained by multi-view stereo (MVS) reconstruction. We assume that lighting is
well-explained as the sum of a view-independent diffuse component and a
view-dependent glossy term concentrated around the mirror reflection direction.
We design a convolutional network around input feature maps that facilitate
learning of an implicit representation of scene materials and illumination,
enabling both relighting and free-viewpoint navigation. We generate these input
maps by exploiting the best elements of both image-based and physically-based
rendering. We sample the input views to estimate diffuse scene irradiance, and
compute the new illumination caused by user-specified light sources using path
tracing. To facilitate the network's understanding of materials and synthesize
plausible glossy reflections, we reproject the views and compute mirror images.
We train the network on a synthetic dataset where each scene is also
reconstructed with MVS. We show results of our algorithm relighting real indoor

not only reconstruct the unknown information, but also to be capable of
performing fluid reasoning about future scenarios in real time. To obtain
physically consistent predictions, we train deep neural networks on the
reduced-order manifold that, through the employ of inductive biases, ensure the
fulfillment of the principles of thermodynamics. RNNs learn from history the
required hidden information to correlate the limited information with the
latent space where the simulation occurs. Finally, a decoder returns data back
to the high-dimensional manifold, so as to provide the user with insightful
information in the form of augmented reality. This algorithm is connected to a
computer vision system to test the performance of the proposed methodology with
real information, resulting in a system capable of understanding and predicting
future states of the observed fluid in real-time.

graph encodings and nonlinear activation functions. Our technique results in
increased optimization performance, a factor of two increase in effective
quantum resources, and a quadratic reduction in measurement complexity. While
the classical simulation of many qubits with traditional quantum formalism is
impossible due to its exponential scaling, we mitigate this limitation with
exact circuit representations using factorized tensor rings. In particular, the
shallow circuits permitted by our technique, combined with efficient factorized
tensor-based simulation, enable us to successfully optimize the MaxCut of the
nonlocally connected $512$-vertex DIMACS library graphs on a single GPU. By
improving the performance of quantum optimization algorithms while requiring
fewer quantum resources and utilizing shallower, more error-resistant circuits,

studied using error-bounded lossy compressors to reduce the data size and
improve the I/O performance. However, little work has been done for effectively
offloading lossy compression onto FPGA-based SmartNICs to reduce the
compression overhead. In this paper, we propose a hardware-algorithm codesign
for an efficient and adaptive lossy compressor for scientific data on FPGAs
(called CEAZ), which is the first lossy compressor that can achieve high
compression ratios and throughputs simultaneously. Specifically, we propose an
efficient Huffman coding approach that can adaptively update Huffman codewords
online based on codewords generated offline, from a variety of representative
scientific datasets. Moreover, we derive a theoretical analysis to support a
precise control of compression ratio under an error-bounded compression mode,
enabling accurate offline Huffman codewords generation. This also helps us
create a fixed-ratio compression mode for consistent throughput. In addition,
we develop an efficient compression pipeline by adopting cuSZ's
dual-quantization algorithm to our hardware use cases. Finally, we evaluate
CEAZ on five real-world datasets with both a single FPGA board and 128 nodes
(to accelerate parallel I/O). Experiments show that CEAZ outperforms the
second-best FPGA-based lossy compressor by 2.3X of throughput and 3.0X of

from the very faint transient neutron star low-mass X-ray binary GRS
1741.9-2853 during a period of outburst in May 2020. We show that the
persistent emission can be modeled as an absorbed, Comptonized blackbody in
addition to Fe K$\alpha$ emission which can be attributed to relativistic disk
reflection. We measure a persistent bolometric, unabsorbed luminosity of
$L_{\mathrm{bol}}=7.03^{+0.04}_{-0.05}\times10^{36}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$,
assuming a distance of 7 kpc, corresponding to an Eddington ratio of $4.5\%$.
This persistent luminosity combined with light curve analysis leads us to infer
that the bursts were the result of pure He burning rather than mixed H/He
burning. Time-resolved spectroscopy reveals that the bolometric flux of the
first burst exhibits a double-peaked structure, placing the source within a
small population of accreting neutron stars which exhibit multiple-peaked
type-I X-ray bursts. We find that the second, brighter burst shows evidence for
photospheric radius expansion (PRE) and that at its peak, this PRE event had an
unabsorbed bolometric flux of
$F_{\mathrm{peak}}=2.94^{+0.28}_{-0.26}\times10^{-8}\,\mathrm{erg\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$.
This yields a new distance estimate of $d=9.0\pm0.5$ kpc, assuming that this
corresponds to the Eddington limit for pure He burning on the surface of a
canonical neutron star. Additionally, we performed a detailed timing analysis
which failed to find evidence for quasiperiodic oscillations or burst
oscillations, and we place an upper limit of $16\%$ on the rms variability

By this, we explain carcinogenesis, tumor progression, and sepsis by
destabilization of the healthy homeostatic state (frequency synchronized), and
emergence of a pathological state (desynchronized or multifrequency cluster).
The coupled dynamics of parenchymal cells (metabolism) and nonspecific immune
cells (reaction of innate immune system) are represented by nodes of a duplex
layer. The cytokine interaction is modeled by adaptive coupling weights between
the nodes representing the immune cells (with fast adaptation time scale) and
the parenchymal cells (slow adaptation time scale) and between the pairs of
parenchymal and immune cells in the duplex network (fixed bidirectional
coupling). Thereby, carcinogenesis, organ dysfunction in sepsis, and recurrence
risk can be described in a correct functional context.

substantial concern over their reliability. While many deep neural networks
have shown impressive performance in terms of predictive accuracy, it has been
shown that in many instances an imperceptible perturbation can falsely flip the
network's prediction. Most research has then focused on developing defenses
against adversarial attacks or learning under a worst-case adversarial loss. In
this work, we take a step back and aim to provide a framework for determining
whether a model's label change under small perturbation is justified (and when
it is not). We carefully argue that adversarial robustness should be defined as
a locally adaptive measure complying with the underlying distribution. We then
suggest a definition for an adaptive robust loss, derive an empirical version
of it, and develop a resulting data-augmentation framework. We prove that our
adaptive data-augmentation maintains consistency of 1-nearest neighbor
classification under deterministic labels and provide illustrative empirical

their use in practice. To overcome this limitation, we extract thousands of
published reports of the key aspects of MOF stability necessary for their
practical application: the ability to withstand high temperatures without
degrading and the capacity to be activated by removal of solvent molecules.
From nearly 4,000 manuscripts, we use natural language processing and automated
image analysis to obtain over 2,000 solvent-removal stability measures and
3,000 thermal degradation temperatures. We analyze the relationships between
stability properties and the chemical and geometric structures in this set to
identify limits of prior heuristics derived from smaller sets of MOFs. By
training predictive machine learning (ML, i.e., Gaussian process and artificial
neural network) models to encode the structure-property relationships with
graph- and pore-structure-based representations, we are able to make
predictions of stability orders of magnitude faster than conventional
physics-based modeling or experiment. Interpretation of important features in
ML models provides insights that we use to identify strategies to engineer
increased stability into typically unstable 3d-containing MOFs that are
frequently targeted for catalytic applications. We expect our approach to

largely rely on features drawn from natural scene statistics (NSS), but under
the assumption that the image statistics are stationary in the spatial domain.
Several of these models are quite successful on standard pictures. However, in
Virtual Reality (VR) applications, foveated video compression is regaining
attention, and the concept of space-variant quality assessment is of interest,
given the availability of increasingly high spatial and temporal resolution
contents and practical ways of measuring gaze direction. Distortions from
foveated video compression increase with increased eccentricity, implying that
the natural scene statistics are space-variant. Towards advancing the
development of foveated compression / streaming algorithms, we have devised a
no-reference (NR) foveated video quality assessment model, called FOVQA, which
is based on new models of space-variant natural scene statistics (NSS) and
natural video statistics (NVS). Specifically, we deploy a space-variant
generalized Gaussian distribution (SV-GGD) model and a space-variant
asynchronous generalized Gaussian distribution (SV-AGGD) model of mean
subtracted contrast normalized (MSCN) coefficients and products of neighboring
MSCN coefficients, respectively. We devise a foveated video quality predictor
that extracts radial basis features, and other features that capture
perceptually annoying rapid quality fall-offs. We find that FOVQA achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the new 2D LIVE-FBT-FCVR database, as

Informally, given $n \gtrsim d/\alpha^2$ samples from such a distribution with
mean $\mu$ and covariance $\Sigma$, our estimators output $\tilde\mu$ such that
$\| \tilde\mu - \mu \|_{\Sigma} \leq \alpha$, where $\| \cdot \|_{\Sigma}$ is
the Mahalanobis distance. All previous estimators with the same guarantee

$\Omega(d^{3/2})$ samples.
  Each of our estimators is based on a simple, general approach to designing
differentially private mechanisms, but with novel technical steps to make the
estimator private and sample-efficient. Our first estimator samples a point
with approximately maximum Tukey depth using the exponential mechanism, but
restricted to the set of points of large Tukey depth. Proving that this
mechanism is private requires a novel analysis. Our second estimator perturbs
the empirical mean of the data set with noise calibrated to the empirical

slightly worse dependence on the privacy parameter. For both estimators,
careful preprocessing of the data is required to satisfy differential privacy.

an adaptive approach to imaging via spatial mode demultiplexing that
iteratively updates both the form of the spatial imaging modes and the estimate
of the source distribution. The optimal imaging modes are determined by
minimizing the estimated Cram\'er-Rao bound over the manifold of all possible
sets of orthogonal imaging modes. We have observed through Monte Carlo
simulations that the manifold-optimized spatial mode demultiplexing measurement
consistently outperforms standard imaging techniques in the accuracy of source
reconstructions and comes within a factor of 2 of the absolute quantum limit as
set by the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound. The adaptive framework presented here
allows for a consistent approach to achieving near quantum-limited imaging
resolution of arbitrarily distributed sources through spatial mode imaging
techniques.

introducing nutrients into the euphotic zone. We found the shallower
chlorophyll-a maximum in oxygenated waters became more intense when denser
waters (more nutrients) moved toward the surface. It suggests that isopycnals
and nitracline displacements modify the nutrient supply in the euphotic zone,
which produces changes in phytoplankton growth. The suboxic and deeper
chlorophyll a maximum showed a strong association with the 26 kg m^{-3}
isopycnal being only mechanically displaced, and its chlorophyll-a content does
not seem to covary with irradiance or nutrients. The different responses of the
chlorophyll-a maxima could be explained if different phytoplankton groups are
associated with them. Long Rossby Waves can affect the position of the
thermocline, nitracline and isopycnals in an annual cycle, but it seems to be a
background signal modulated by higher frequency processes such as mesoscale
eddies and other Rossby waves. The co-occurrence of processes can control the
nitracline depth, and hence the input of nutrients into the euphotic zone that
can cause sporadic enhancements of the chlorophyll-a concentration of one

that TRGB measurements made in star-forming regions, with concomitantly high

as compared to the same measurements made in quiescent regions. Once these low
accuracy fields are excluded from consideration, the TRGB can be used for the
first time to constrain the three-dimensional plane geometry of the LMC.
Composite CMDs are constructed for the SMC and LMC from only those fields with
well-defined TRGB features, and the highest accuracy TRGB zero point
calibration to date is presented. The $I$-band TRGB magnitude is measured to be
flat over the color range $ 1.45 < (V-I)_0 < 1.95$ mag, with a modest slope
introduced when including metal-rich (up to $(V-I)_0 = 2.2$ mag) Tip stars into

consistent with the canonical value of $-4.05$ mag for the old, metal-poor

that of the hardest query with equality joins in the disjunction exhibited by
our equivalence. This is captured by a new width measure called the IJ-width.

Iota-acyclicity is for intersection joins what alpha-acyclicity is for equality

observations of the resonantly scattered UV emission of the coronal plasma
obtained with UVCS-SOHO, designed to measure the wind outflow speed by applying
the Doppler dimming diagnostics. Metis on Solar Orbiter complements the UVCS
spectroscopic observations, performed during solar activity cycle 23, by
simultaneously imaging the polarized visible light and the HI Ly-alpha corona
in order to obtain high-spatial and temporal resolution maps of the outward
velocity of the continuously expanding solar atmosphere. The Metis
observations, on May 15, 2020, provide the first HI Ly-alpha images of the
extended corona and the first instantaneous map of the speed of the coronal
plasma outflows during the minimum of solar activity and allow us to identify
the layer where the slow wind flow is observed. The polarized visible light
(580-640 nm), and the UV HI Ly-alpha (121.6 nm) coronal emissions, obtained
with the two Metis channels, are combined in order to measure the dimming of
the UV emission relative to a static corona. This effect is caused by the
outward motion of the coronal plasma along the direction of incidence of the
chromospheric photons on the coronal neutral hydrogen. The plasma outflow
velocity is then derived as a function of the measured Doppler dimming. The
static corona UV emission is simulated on the basis of the plasma electron
density inferred from the polarized visible light. This study leads to the
identification, in the velocity maps of the solar corona, of the high-density
layer about +/-10 deg wide, centered on the extension of a quiet equatorial
streamer present at the East limb where the slowest wind flows at about (160
+/- 18) km/s from 4 Rs to 6 Rs. Beyond the boundaries of the high-density
layer, the wind velocity rapidly increases, marking the transition between slow
and fast wind in the corona.

of their steady torsional flow data to determine their yield stress and other
parameters of their shear viscosity material function challenging. Roughened
surfaces to prevent wall slip can be used but such methods frequently result in
the fracturing of the sample. Instead, it is shown here that the yield stress
of a viscoplastic fluid can be determined from the torque versus apparent shear
rate data of steady torsional flow using a single gap. The step change in the
slope of the torque versus apparent shear rate data of a viscoplastic fluid
marks the yield stress of the fluid. For demonstration, the
earlier-characterized parameters of the shear viscosity and apparent wall slip
behavior of a viscoplastic suspension [He et al., J. Rheology, 63, 19 (2019)]
were used for obtaining the shear stress distribution and the torque at each
rotational speed. The yield stress, determined from the torque versus apparent

comparison of the wall slip velocities with wall velocities, while at the same
time enabling the determination of the other parameters of the shear viscosity
material function of the viscoplastic fluid.

and industrial systems. This drag critically depends on the separation between
the rod and the wall and can be approximated asymptotically in specific
regimes, namely far from, or very close to, the wall, but is typically
determined numerically for general separations. In this note we determine an
asymptotic representation of the local drag for a slender rod parallel to a
wall which is valid for all separations. This is possible through matching the
behaviour of a rod close to the wall and a rod far from the wall. We show that
the leading order drag in both these regimes has been known since 1981 and that
they can used to produce a composite representation of the drag which is valid
for all separations. This is in contrast to a sphere above a wall, where no
simple uniformly valid representation exists. We estimate the error on this
composite representation as the separation increases, discuss how the results
could be used as resistive-force theory and demonstrate their use on a
two-hinged swimmer above a wall.

achieve competitive accuracy to manually-tuned prompts across a wide range of

task, we show that this memory overhead can be substantially reduced:
finetuning only the bias terms can achieve comparable or better accuracy than
standard finetuning while only updating 0.1% of the parameters. All in all, we
recommend finetuning LMs for few-shot learning as it is more accurate, robust

5-9 magnitudes fainter than the primary at optical wavelengths. We detect 102
close stellar companions and determine the separation, magnitude difference,
mass ratio, and estimated orbital period for each system. Our observations of
exoplanet host star binaries reveal that they have wider separations than field
binaries, with a mean orbital semi-major axis near 100 AU. Other imaging
studies have suggested this dearth of very closely separated binaries in
systems which host exoplanets, but incompleteness at small separations makes it
difficult to disentangle unobserved companions from a true lack of companions.
With our improved angular resolution and sensitivity, we confirm that this lack
of close exoplanet host binaries is indeed real. We also search for a
correlation between planetary orbital radii vs. binary star separation, but
given the very short orbital periods of the TESS planets, we do not find any
clear trend. We do note that in exoplanet systems containing binary host stars,
there is an observational bias against detecting Earth-size planet transits due
to transit depth dilution caused by the companion star.

  Reasoning",,,,,"cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The ability to perform causal and counterfactual reasoning are central
properties of human intelligence. Decision-making systems that can perform
these types of reasoning have the potential to be more generalizable and
interpretable. Simulations have helped advance the state-of-the-art in this
domain, by providing the ability to systematically vary parameters (e.g.,
confounders) and generate examples of the outcomes in the case of
counterfactual scenarios. However, simulating complex temporal causal events in
multi-agent scenarios, such as those that exist in driving and vehicle
navigation, is challenging. To help address this, we present a high-fidelity
simulation environment that is designed for developing algorithms for causal
discovery and counterfactual reasoning in the safety-critical context. A core
component of our work is to introduce \textit{agency}, such that it is simple
to define and create complex scenarios using high-level definitions. The
vehicles then operate with agency to complete these objectives, meaning
low-level behaviors need only be controlled if necessary. We perform
experiments with three state-of-the-art methods to create baselines and
highlight the affordances of this environment. Finally, we highlight challenges
and opportunities for future work.

more efficient and accurate detection models. Towards this goal, we propose
Range Sparse Net (RSN), a simple, efficient, and accurate 3D object detector in
order to tackle real time 3D object detection in this extended detection
regime. RSN predicts foreground points from range images and applies sparse
convolutions on the selected foreground points to detect objects. The
lightweight 2D convolutions on dense range images results in significantly
fewer selected foreground points, thus enabling the later sparse convolutions
in RSN to efficiently operate. Combining features from the range image further
enhance detection accuracy. RSN runs at more than 60 frames per second on a
150m x 150m detection region on Waymo Open Dataset (WOD) while being more
accurate than previously published detectors. As of 11/2020, RSN is ranked
first in the WOD leaderboard based on the APH/LEVEL 1 metrics for LiDAR-based
pedestrian and vehicle detection, while being several times faster than
alternatives.

To distinguish cluster candidates from stars, we introduce the Multiple
Concentration Index (MCI) parameter, and measure inner and outer MCIs to probe
morphology in more detail than with a single, standard concentration index
(CI). We improve upon cluster candidate selection, jointly basing our criteria
on expectations for MCI derived from synthetic cluster populations and existing
cluster catalogues, yielding model and semi-empirical selection regions
(respectively). Selection purity (confirmed clusters versus candidates,
assessed via human-based classification) is high (up to 70$\%$) for moderately
luminous sources in the semi-empirical selection region, and somewhat lower
overall (outside the region or fainter). The number of candidates rises steeply
with decreasing luminosity, but pipeline-integrated Machine Learning (ML)
classification prevents this from being problematic. We quantify the
performance of our PHANGS-HST methods in comparison to LEGUS for a sample of
four galaxies in common to both surveys, finding overall agreement with

also subtle differences attributable to specific choices adopted by each

has been heatedly discussed over decades. However, current reports mainly focus
on theoretic proposals and architecture designs, works on practical
implementations on real-life networks are yet to appear. This paper proposes
our effort toward the implementation of knowledge graph driven approach for
autonomic network management in software defined networks (SDNs), termed as
SeaNet. Driven by the ToCo ontology, SeaNet is reprogrammed based on Mininet (a
SDN emulator). It consists three core components, a knowledge graph generator,
a SPARQL engine, and a network management API. The knowledge graph generator
represents the knowledge in the telecommunication network management tasks into
formally represented ontology driven model. Expert experience and network
management rules can be formalized into knowledge graph and by automatically
inferenced by SPARQL engine, Network management API is able to packet
technology-specific details and expose technology-independent interfaces to
users. The Experiments are carried out to evaluate proposed work by comparing
with a commercial SDN controller Ryu implemented by the same language Python.
The evaluation results show that SeaNet is considerably faster in most
circumstances than Ryu and the SeaNet code is significantly more compact.
Benefit from RDF reasoning, SeaNet is able to achieve O(1) time complexity on
different scales of the knowledge graph while the traditional database can
achieve O(nlogn) at its best. With the developed network management API, SeaNet
enables researchers to develop semantic-intelligent applications on their own
SDNs.

produced, which generate osmotic pressure that deforms and debonds the
coating.These mechanisms are experimentally well-supported; however,
comprehensive macroscopic models capable of predicting the formation osmotic
blisters, without extensive data-fitting, is scant. Here, we develop a general
mathematical theory of blistering and apply it to the failure of anti-corrosion
coatings on carbon steel. The model is able to predict the irreversible,
nonlinear blister growth dynamics, which eventually reaches a stable state,
ruptures, or undergoes runaway delamination, depending on the mechanical and
adhesion properties of the coating. For runaway delamination, the theory
predicts a critical delamination length, beyond which unstable corrosion-driven
growth occurs. The model is able to fit multiple sets of blister growth data
with no fitting parameters. Corrosion experiments are also performed to observe
undercoat rusting on carbon steel, which yielded trends comparable with model
predictions. The theory is used to define three dimensionless numbers which can
be used for engineering design of elastic coatings capable of resisting visible
deformation, rupture, and delamination.

variables sampled for prolonged periods of time. For example, in neuroscience,
the activities of 100s-1000's of neurons are recorded during behaviors and in
response to sensory stimuli. Multi-output Gaussian process models leverage the
nonparametric nature of Gaussian processes to capture structure across multiple
outputs. However, this class of models typically assumes that the correlations
between the output response variables are invariant in the input space.
Stochastic linear mixing models (SLMM) assume the mixture coefficients depend
on input, making them more flexible and effective to capture complex output
dependence. However, currently, the inference for SLMMs is intractable for
large datasets, making them inapplicable to several modern time-series
problems. In this paper, we propose a new regression framework, the orthogonal
stochastic linear mixing model (OSLMM) that introduces an orthogonal constraint
amongst the mixing coefficients. This constraint reduces the computational
burden of inference while retaining the capability to handle complex output

at $z=0$) to explain the formation of MP r-II stars in UFDs. We employ a simple
toy model for NSM events, adopting parameters consistent with observations,
such as the NSM rate (1 per $M_{\ast}\approx10^5$ solar mass) and europium (Eu)
mass ($M_{Eu}\approx10^{-5}$ solar mass). We identify only one simulated galaxy
($ M_{vir}\approx4.6\times10^7$, $M_{\ast}\approx 3.4\times 10^3$ solar mass at
$z=0$) with abundances similar to Ret~II in a simulation volume that hosts
$\sim30$ UFD analogs, indicating that such abundances are possible but rare. By
exploring a range of key parameters, we demonstrate that the most important
factor in determining the formation of MP r-II stars in UFDs is how quickly
subsequent stars can be formed out of r-process enriched gas. We find that it
takes between 10 to 100~Myr to form the first and second burst of MP r-II
stars. Over this period, Eu-polluted gas maintains the required high abundance
ratios of $\rm [Eu/Fe]>1$.

because of its ability to generalize to different subjects, without the need of
any training data and eye gaze annotations. Model-based eye tracking, however,
is susceptible to eye feature detection errors, in particular for eye tracking
in the wild. To address this issue, we propose a Bayesian framework for
model-based eye tracking. The proposed system consists of a cascade-Bayesian
Convolutional Neural Network (c-BCNN) to capture the probabilistic
relationships between eye appearance and its landmarks, and a geometric eye
model to estimate eye gaze from the eye landmarks. Given a testing eye image,
the Bayesian framework can generate, through Bayesian inference, the eye gaze
distribution without explicit landmark detection and model training, based on
which it not only estimates the most likely eye gaze but also its uncertainty.
Furthermore, with Bayesian inference instead of point-based inference, our
model can not only generalize better to different sub-jects, head poses, and
environments but also is robust to image noise and landmark detection errors.
Finally, with the estimated gaze uncertainty, we can construct a cascade
architecture that allows us to progressively improve gaze estimation accuracy.
Compared to state-of-the-art model-based and learning-based methods, the
proposed Bayesian framework demonstrates significant improvement in
generalization capability across several benchmark datasets and in accuracy and
robustness under challenging real-world conditions.

mapping from an image to its saliency map, and thus fail to explain the
subjective nature of human attention. In this paper, to model the uncertainty
of visual saliency, we study the saliency prediction problem from the
perspective of generative models by learning a conditional probability
distribution over the saliency map given an input image, and treating the
saliency prediction as a sampling process from the learned distribution.
Specifically, we propose a generative cooperative saliency prediction
framework, where a conditional latent variable model (LVM) and a conditional
energy-based model (EBM) are jointly trained to predict salient objects in a
cooperative manner. The LVM serves as a fast but coarse predictor to
efficiently produce an initial saliency map, which is then refined by the
iterative Langevin revision of the EBM that serves as a slow but fine
predictor. Such a coarse-to-fine cooperative saliency prediction strategy
offers the best of both worlds. Moreover, we propose a ""cooperative learning
while recovering"" strategy and apply it to weakly supervised saliency
prediction, where saliency annotations of training images are partially
observed. Lastly, we find that the learned energy function in the EBM can serve
as a refinement module that can refine the results of other pre-trained
saliency prediction models. Experimental results show that our model can
produce a set of diverse and plausible saliency maps of an image, and obtain
state-of-the-art performance in both fully supervised and weakly supervised

Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the final diagnosis. Clinically,
facial expression (FE) and actions play a vital role in clinician-administered
evaluation, while FE and action are underexplored for self-administered

evidence the validity of self-rating questionnaires with their corresponding
question-wise video recording. To automatically interpret depression from the
SDS evaluation and the paired video, we propose an end-to-end hierarchical
framework for the long-term variable-length video, which is also conditioned on
the questionnaire results and the answering time. Specifically, we resort to a
hierarchical model which utilizes a 3D CNN for local temporal pattern
exploration and a redundancy-aware self-attention (RAS) scheme for
question-wise global feature aggregation. Targeting for the redundant long-term
FE video processing, our RAS is able to effectively exploit the correlations of
each video clip within a question set to emphasize the discriminative
information and eliminate the redundancy based on feature pair-wise affinity.
Then, the question-wise video feature is concatenated with the questionnaire
scores for final depression detection. Our thorough evaluations also show the
validity of fusing SDS evaluation and its video recording, and the superiority

are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, which poses a threat to
security-sensitive image recognition task. Prior work has shown that JPEG
compression can combat the drop in classification accuracy on adversarial
examples to some extent. But, as the compression ratio increases, traditional
JPEG compression is insufficient to defend those attacks but can cause an
abrupt accuracy decline to the benign images. In this paper, with the aim of
fully filtering the adversarial perturbations, we firstly make modifications to
traditional JPEG compression algorithm which becomes more favorable for NN.
Specifically, based on an analysis of the frequency coefficient, we design a
NN-favored quantization table for compression. Considering compression as a
data augmentation strategy, we then combine our model-agnostic preprocess with
noisy training. We fine-tune the pre-trained model by training with images
encoded at different compression levels, thus generating multiple classifiers.
Finally, since lower (higher) compression ratio can remove both perturbations
and original features slightly (aggressively), we use these trained multiple
models for model ensemble. The majority vote of the ensemble of models is
adopted as final predictions. Experiments results show our method can improve

an emergent gapless topological Luttinger liquid which is beyond the

spin texture, and propose feasible scheme for experimental observation. We
consider a one-dimensional spin-orbit coupled Fermi-Hubbard model with
fractional filling, whose low-energy physics is effectively described by a
spinless Luttinger liquid and is trivial in the conventional characterization.
We show that, as being tuned by the filling factor and interaction strength,
the many-body ground state may exhibit nontrivial winding in its bulk spin
texture in the projected momentum space, manifesting an emergent topological
phase. A topological transition occurs when the projected spin-state at a high
symmetry momentum becomes fully mixed one, resulting from competing processes
of particle scattering to the lower and higher subbands, for which the spin
texture at such momentum point is ill-defined, but the Luttinger liquid keeps
gapless through the transition. Surprisingly, at relatively small filling the
Luttinger liquid remains topologically nontrivial even at infinitely strong
interaction. The results can be generalized to finite temperature which
facilitates the real experimental detection. This work shows a novel gapless
topological Luttinger liquid whose characterization is beyond the low-energy

decomposing the full MI estimation problem into a sum of smaller estimation
problems by splitting one of the views into progressively more informed

This expression contains a sum of unconditional and conditional MI terms, each
measuring modest chunks of the total MI, which facilitates approximation via
contrastive bounds. To maximize the sum, we formulate a contrastive lower bound
on the conditional MI which can be approximated efficiently. We refer to our

ideas flexible. However, in a domain that requires accurate statements, it
becomes a barrier. Specifically, a single word can have many meanings and
multiple words can have the same meaning. When translating a text into a
foreign language, the translator needs to determine the exact meaning of each
element in the original sentence to produce the correct translation sentence.
From that observation, in this paper, we propose ParaLaw Nets, a pretrained
model family using sentence-level cross-lingual information to reduce ambiguity
and increase the performance in legal text processing. This approach achieved
the best result in the Question Answering task of COLIEE-2021.

Boltzmann method to elucidate the connection between the elastic rebound of an
impactor and relations among the impact speed $u_0$, maximum force acting on
the impactor $F_{\rm max}$, and elapsed time $t_{\rm max}$ to reach $F_{\rm
max}$. We find that $t_{\rm max}$ emerges in the early stage of the impact,
while the rebound process takes place in the late stage. We find a crossover of
$F_{\rm max}$ from $u_0$ independent regime for low $u_0$ to a power law regime
satisfying $F_{\rm max}\propto u_0^\alpha$ with $\alpha\approx 1.5$ for high
$u_0$. Similarly, $t_{\rm max}$ satisfies $t_{\rm max}\propto u_0^{\beta}$ with
$\beta\approx -0.5$ for high $u_0$. Both power-law relations for $F_{\rm max}$
and $t_{\rm max}$ versus $u_0$ for high $u_0$ are independent of the system
size, but the rebound phenomenon strongly depends on the depth of the container
for suspensions. Thus, we indicate that the rebound phenomenon is not directly
related to the relations among $u_0$, $F_{\rm max}$ and $t_{\rm max}$. We
propose a floating + force chain model, where the rebound process is caused by
an elastic term that is proportional to the number of the connected force
chains from the impactor to the bottom plate. On the other hand, there are no
elastic contributions in the relations for $F_{\rm max}$ and $t_{\rm max}$
against $u_0$ because of the absence of percolated force chains in the early
stage. This phenomenology predicts $F_{\rm max}\propto u_0^{3/2}$ and $t_{\rm
max}\propto u_0^{-1/2}$ for high $u_0$ and also recovers the behavior of the
impactor quantitatively even if there is the rebound process.

study the orbital variability of the spectrum above 10 keV. The hard X-ray
spectrum is well described with a single power-law component up to 78 keV. The
X-ray flux showed a slight deviation from those observed previously with Suzaku
in 2007. The fast X-ray brightening observed with Suzaku, around the inferior
conjunction, was not observed in this observation. We also analyzed 11 years of
Fermi Large Area Telescope data of LS 5039. The GeV spectrum around the
inferior conjunction was well described with two non-thermal components; a
power law with a photon index of $\sim 3$ and a cut-off power law with a cutoff
energy of $\sim 2$ GeV. The orbital flux variability also changed gradually
around a few GeV. These results indicate that there are two emission components
in the GeV band, and the dominant component above $\sim 1$ GeV does not depend

is called {\em multi-$\mathcal P$} if $E$ can be isomorphically embedded into a
product of spaces that belong to $\mathcal P$. We investigate the question
whether the free locally convex space $L(X)$ is strongly nuclear, nuclear,
Schwartz, multi-Hilbert or multi-reflexive.
  If $X$ is a Tychonoff space containing an infinite compact subset then, as it
follows from the results of \cite{Aus}, $L(X)$ is not nuclear. We prove that
for such $X$ the free LCS $L(X)$ has the stronger property of not being
multi-Hilbert. We deduce that if $X$ is a $k$-space, then the following
properties are equivalent: (1) $L(X)$ is strongly nuclear; (2) $L(X)$ is
nuclear; (3) $L(X)$ is multi-Hilbert; (4) $X$ is countable and discrete. On the
other hand, we show that $L(X)$ is strongly nuclear for every projectively
countable $P$-space (in particular, for every Lindel\""of $P$-space) $X$.
  We observe that every Schwartz LCS is multi-reflexive. It is known that if
$X$ is a $k_\omega$-space, then $L(X)$ is a Schwartz LCS \cite{Chasco}, hence
$L(X)$ is multi-reflexive. We show that for any first-countable paracompact
  (in particular, metrizable) space $X$ the converse is true, so $L(X)$ is
multi-reflexive if and only if $X$ is a $k_\omega$-space, equivalently, if $X$
is a locally compact and $\sigma$-compact space.
  Similarly, we show that for any first-countable paracompact space $X$ the
free abelian topological group $A(X)$ is a Schwartz group if and only if $X$ is
a locally compact space such that the set $X^{(1)}$ of all non-isolated points
of $X$ is $\sigma$-compact.

samples from an unknown distribution $p$ over $\{1, \dots, n\}$, is it
$\varepsilon_1$-close to or $\varepsilon_2$-far from a reference distribution
$q$ (in total variation distance)? Despite significant interest over the past
decade, this problem is well understood only in the extreme cases. In the
noiseless setting (i.e., $\varepsilon_1 = 0$) the sample complexity is
$\Theta(\sqrt{n})$, strongly sublinear in the domain size. At the other end of
the spectrum, when $\varepsilon_1 = \varepsilon_2/2$, the sample complexity
jumps to the barely sublinear $\Theta(n/\log n)$. However, very little is known
about the intermediate regime. We fully characterize the price of tolerance in
distribution testing as a function of $n$, $\varepsilon_1$, $\varepsilon_2$, up
to a single $\log n$ factor. Specifically, we show the sample complexity to be
\[\tilde \Theta\left(\frac{\sqrt{n}}{\varepsilon_2^{2}} + \frac{n}{\log n}
\cdot \max
\left\{\frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_2^2},\left(\frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon_2^2}\right)^{\!\!2}\right\}\right),\]
providing a smooth tradeoff between the two previously known cases. We also
provide a similar characterization for the problem of tolerant equivalence
testing, where both $p$ and $q$ are unknown. Surprisingly, in both cases, the
main quantity dictating the sample complexity is the ratio
$\varepsilon_1/\varepsilon_2^2$, and not the more intuitive
$\varepsilon_1/\varepsilon_2$. Of particular technical interest is our lower
bound framework, which involves novel approximation-theoretic tools required to
handle the asymmetry between $\varepsilon_1$ and $\varepsilon_2$, a challenge
absent from previous works.

computation of all GAN-based neural vocoders comes from the stacked upsampling
layers, which were designed to match the length of the waveform's length of
output and temporal resolution. Meanwhile, the computational complexity of
upsampling networks is closely correlated with the numbers of samples generated
for each window. To reduce the computation of upsampling layers, we propose a
new GAN based neural vocoder called Basis-MelGAN where the raw audio samples
are decomposed with a learned basis and their associated weights. As the
prediction targets of Basis-MelGAN are the weight values associated with each

potentially powerful new tool for identifying possible exomoon hosts, enabled
by the observation that fully half of all planets hosting an exomoon will
exhibit transit timing variation (TTV) periodicities of 2-4 epochs. One key
outstanding problem in the search for exomoons, however, is the question of how
well the methods we have developed under the single moon assumption extend to
systems with multiple moons. In this work we use $N$-body simulations to
examine the exomoon corridor effect in the more general case of $N \geq 1$
moons, generating realistic TTVs produced by satellite systems more akin to
those seen in the outer Solar System. We find that indeed the relationship does
hold for systems with up to 5 moons in both resonant and non-resonant chain
configurations. Our results suggest an observational bias against finding
systems with large numbers of massive moons; as the number of moons increases,
total satellite mass ratios are generally required to be significantly lower in
order to maintain stability, or architectures must be more finely tuned to
survive. Moons produced in impact or capture scenarios may therefore dominate
early detections. Finally, we examine the distribution of TTV periods measured
for a large number of Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) and find the same
characteristic exomoon corridor distribution in several cases. This could be
dynamical evidence for an abundance of moons in the field, though we caution
against strong inferences based on this result.

also opens up different vulnerabilities and bugs in SCs that malicious actors
exploit to carry out malicious or illegal activities on the cryptocurrency

and the vulnerabilities present in SCs and find that some malicious activities
are correlated with certain types of vulnerabilities. We then develop and study
the feasibility of a scoring mechanism that corresponds to the severity of the
vulnerabilities present in SCs to determine if it is a relevant feature to
identify suspicious SCs. We analyze the utility of severity score towards
detection of suspicious SCs using unsupervised machine learning (ML) algorithms
across different temporal granularities and identify behavioral changes. In our
experiments with on-chain SCs, we were able to find a total of 1094 benign SCs
across different granularities which behave similar to malicious SCs, with the
inclusion of the smart contract vulnerability scores in the feature set.

learning models in different domains. For graph-level tasks such as graph
classification, graphs can also be regarded as a special type of data samples,
which can be collected and stored in separate local systems. Similar to other
domains, multiple local systems, each holding a small set of graphs, may
benefit from collaboratively training a powerful graph mining model, such as
the popular graph neural networks (GNNs). To provide more motivation towards
such endeavors, we analyze real-world graphs from different domains to confirm
that they indeed share certain graph properties that are statistically
significant compared with random graphs. However, we also find that different
sets of graphs, even from the same domain or same dataset, are non-IID
regarding both graph structures and node features. To handle this, we propose a
graph clustered federated learning (GCFL) framework that dynamically finds
clusters of local systems based on the gradients of GNNs, and theoretically
justify that such clusters can reduce the structure and feature heterogeneity
among graphs owned by the local systems. Moreover, we observe the gradients of
GNNs to be rather fluctuating in GCFL which impedes high-quality clustering,
and design a gradient sequence-based clustering mechanism based on dynamic time
warping (GCFL+). Extensive experimental results and in-depth analysis
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed frameworks.

branching factor of the network on the ultimate mechanical properties of
rubbery materials has not yet been clarified. This study shows that
tri-branching, which entails the lowest branching factor, results in a large
elastic deformation near the theoretical upper bound. This ideal elastic limit
is realized by reversible strain-induced crystallization, providing on-demand
reinforcement. The findings indicate that the polymer chain is highly
orientated along the stretching axis, whereat enhanced reversible
strain-induced crystallization is observed in the tri-branched and not in the
tetra-branched network. A mathematical theory of structural rigidity is used to
explain the difference in the chain orientation. Although tetra-branched

Rather than following classical inverse rendering methodology that involves

relighted images by neural rendering. A key technical innovation is the use of
a novel overcomplete lighting representation, which facilitates lighting
interpolation in the latent space, as well as helping regularize the

also in the leading post-Newtonian expansion of the Earth's gravitational
field. However, establishing the local reference frame with respect to distant
stars leads to the nonzero Faraday phase. In communications between a ground
station and an Earth-orbiting spacecraft this phase is of the order of 10^-10.
Under the same conditions the Wigner phase of special relativity is typically
of the order 10^-4--10^-5. These phases lead to the physical lower bound on
communication errors. However, both types of errors can be simultaneously
mitigated. Moreover, they are countered by a fully reference frame independent
scheme that also handles arbitrary misalignment between the reference frames of

unique representation of real-world objects and their interactions. As graphs
are getting bigger and bigger nowadays, it is common to see their subgraphs
separately collected and stored in multiple local systems. Therefore, it is
natural to consider the subgraph federated learning setting, where each local
system holds a small subgraph that may be biased from the distribution of the
whole graph. Hence, the subgraph federated learning aims to collaboratively
train a powerful and generalizable graph mining model without directly sharing
their graph data. In this work, towards the novel yet realistic setting of
subgraph federated learning, we propose two major techniques: (1) FedSage,
which trains a GraphSage model based on FedAvg to integrate node features, link
structures, and task labels on multiple local subgraphs; (2) FedSage+, which
trains a missing neighbor generator along FedSage to deal with missing links
across local subgraphs. Empirical results on four real-world graph datasets
with synthesized subgraph federated learning settings demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed techniques. At the same time,
consistent theoretical implications are made towards their generalization
ability on the global graphs.

increased interest in making inferences about individual-level parameters.
While technology may provide substantial data on a single individual, how best
to use multisource population data to improve individualized inference remains
an open research question. One possible approach, the multisource
exchangeability model (MEM), is a Bayesian method for integrating data from
supplementary sources into the analysis of a primary source. MEM was originally
developed to improve inference for a single study by asymmetrically borrowing
information from a set of similar previous studies and was further developed to
apply a more computationally intensive symmetric borrowing in the context of
basket trial; however, even for asymmetric borrowing, its computational burden
grows exponentially with the number of supplementary sources, making it
unsuitable for applications where hundreds or thousands of supplementary
sources (i.e., individuals) could contribute to inference on a given
individual. In this paper, we propose the data-driven MEM (dMEM), a two-stage
approach that includes both source selection and clustering to enable the
inclusion of an arbitrary number of sources to contribute to individualized
inference in a computationally tractable and data-efficient way. We illustrate
the application of dMEM to individual-level human behavior and mental
well-being data collected via smartphones, where our approach increases
individual-level estimation precision by 84% compared with a standard
no-borrowing method and outperforms recently-proposed competing methods in 80%
of individuals.

  Question Answering","Accepted by IJCAI 2021. Please cite the conference version",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Video Question Answering (Video QA) is a powerful testbed to develop new AI
capabilities. This task necessitates learning to reason about objects,
relations, and events across visual and linguistic domains in space-time.
High-level reasoning demands lifting from associative visual pattern
recognition to symbol-like manipulation over objects, their behavior and
interactions. Toward reaching this goal we propose an object-oriented reasoning
approach in that video is abstracted as a dynamic stream of interacting
objects. At each stage of the video event flow, these objects interact with
each other, and their interactions are reasoned about with respect to the query
and under the overall context of a video. This mechanism is materialized into a
family of general-purpose neural units and their multi-level architecture
called Hierarchical Object-oriented Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (HOSTR) networks.
This neural model maintains the objects' consistent lifelines in the form of a
hierarchically nested spatio-temporal graph. Within this graph, the dynamic
interactive object-oriented representations are built up along the video
sequence, hierarchically abstracted in a bottom-up manner, and converge toward
the key information for the correct answer. The method is evaluated on multiple
major Video QA datasets and establishes new state-of-the-arts in these tasks.
Analysis into the model's behavior indicates that object-oriented reasoning is
a reliable, interpretable and efficient approach to Video QA.

formaldehyde in high-mass star-forming cores at different evolutionary stages
to investigate whether the deuteration fraction of formaldehyde can be used as
an evolutionary tracer. Using the APEX SEPIA Band 5 receiver, we extended our
pilot study of the $J$=3$\rightarrow$2 rotational lines of HDCO and D$_2$CO to
eleven high-mass star-forming regions that host objects at different

ALMA Band 6 were performed to reveal the size of the H$_2$CO emission and to
give an estimate of the deuteration fractions HDCO/H$_2$CO and D$_2$CO/HDCO at
scales of $\sim$6"" (0.04-0.15 pc at the distance of our targets). Our

HDCO and D$_2$CO emission from the youngest sources (high-mass starless cores,
HMSCs). Our extended study supports the results of the previous pilot study:
the deuteration fraction of formaldehyde decreases with evolutionary stage, but
higher sensitivity observations are needed to provide more stringent
constraints on the D/H ratio during the HMSC phase. The calculated upper limits
for the HMSC sources are high, so the trend between HMSC and HMPO phases cannot
be constrained.

the expressiveness and greatly eases the learning compared to Gaussians used in

data samples is considered for physical systems with known parametric
statistical models. The standalone learning-based and statistical model-based
classifiers face major challenges towards the fulfillment of the classification
task using a small training set. Specifically, classifiers that solely rely on
the physics-based statistical models usually suffer from their inability to
properly tune the underlying unobservable parameters, which leads to a
mismatched representation of the system's behaviors. Learning-based
classifiers, on the other hand, typically rely on a large number of training
data from the underlying physical process, which might not be feasible in most
practical scenarios. In this paper, a hybrid classification method -- termed
HyPhyLearn -- is proposed that exploits both the physics-based statistical
models and the learning-based classifiers. The proposed solution is based on
the conjecture that HyPhyLearn would alleviate the challenges associated with
the individual approaches of learning-based and statistical model-based
classifiers by fusing their respective strengths. The proposed hybrid approach
first estimates the unobservable model parameters using the available
(suboptimal) statistical estimation procedures, and subsequently use the
physics-based statistical models to generate synthetic data. Then, the training
data samples are incorporated with the synthetic data in a learning-based
classifier that is based on domain-adversarial training of neural networks.
Specifically, in order to address the mismatch problem, the classifier learns a
mapping from the training data and the synthetic data to a common feature
space. Simultaneously, the classifier is trained to find discriminative
features within this space in order to fulfill the classification task.

One of the extensions, introduced in \cite{Armaselu-FWCG}, is called
\textit{MBSR with outliers} or MBSR-O, and is a more general version of the
MBSR problem in which the optimal rectangle is allowed to contain up to $k$
outliers, where $k$ is given as part of the input. For MBSR-O, we improve the
previous known running time bounds of $O(k^7 m \log m + n)$ to $O(k^3 m + m

MBSR-C and asks for the largest axis-aligned rectangle separating red points
from blue unit circles. For MBSR-C, we provide an algorithm that runs in $O(m^2

  State-Constrained Optimal Control Problems",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY math.OC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper investigates a Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) analysis to solve
finite-horizon optimal control problems for high-dimensional systems. Although
grid-based methods, such as the level-set method [1], numerically solve a
general class of HJ partial differential equations, the computational
complexity is exponential in the dimension of the continuous state. To manage
this computational complexity, methods based on Lax-Hopf theory have been
developed for the state-unconstrained optimal control problem under certain
assumptions, such as affine dynamics and state-independent stage cost. Based on
the Lax formula [2], this paper proposes an HJ formula for the
state-constrained optimal control problem for nonlinear systems. We call this
formula \textit{the generalized Lax formula} for the optimal control problem.
The HJ formula provides both the optimal cost and an optimal control signal. We
also provide an efficient computational method for a class of problems for
which the dynamics is affine in the state, and for which the stage and terminal
cost, as well as the state constraints, are convex in the state. This class of
problems does not require affine dynamics and convex stage cost in the control.
This paper also provides three practical examples.

benefits from inherent nontrivial geometry to host diverse quantum phases,
ranging from spin-liquid phases, topological matter to intertwined orders, and
most rarely unconventional superconductivity. Recently, charge sensitive probes
have suggested that the kagome superconductors AV_3Sb_5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) (A = K,
Rb, Cs) exhibit unconventional chiral charge order, which is analogous to the
long-sought-after quantum order in the Haldane model or Varma model. However,
direct evidence for the time-reversal symmetry-breaking of the charge order
remains elusive. Here we utilize muon spin relaxation to probe the kagome
charge order and superconductivity in KV_3Sb_5. We observe a striking
enhancement of the internal field width sensed by the muon ensemble, which
takes place just below the charge ordering temperature and persists into the
superconducting state. Remarkably, the muon spin relaxation rate below the
charge ordering temperature is substantially enhanced by applying an external
magnetic field. We further show the multigap nature of superconductivity in
KV_3Sb_5 and that the T_c/lambda_{ab}^{-2} ratio is comparable to those of
unconventional high-temperature superconductors. Our results point to
time-reversal symmetry breaking charge order intertwining with unconventional
superconductivity in the correlated kagome lattice.

struggle to convey all the details in an image as we humans do. Meanwhile, with
recent language models' progress, descriptive text may be an alternative to

propose to take description-question pairs as input, instead of deep visual

process and the computational cost. We also experiment with data augmentation
techniques to increase the diversity in the training set and avoid learning

identify the most visible routines, but these methods are not suitable when it
comes to identifying the long tail of routines in an organization. This article
proposes an approach to discover automatable routines from logs of user

such routines. The approach starts by discovering frequent routines at a
control-flow level (candidate routines). It then determines which of these
candidate routines are automatable and it synthetizes an executable

scheme of $^{60}$V. The lifetime of an isomeric state in $^{64}$V was measured
for the first time in the present experiment. A previously unobserved isomeric
state was discovered in $^{58}$Sc. The measured lifetime suggests a parity
changing transition, originating from an odd number of neutrons in the

different from isomers in the less exotic V and Sc nuclei.

nuclear and multiquark equations of state. The equation of state of the
multiquark phase from the holographic Sakai-Sugimoto~(SS) model is relatively
stiff in the low density region and becomes softer at high densities. The
values of Love number and dimensionless deformation parameter, $k_{2}$ and
$\Lambda$, are found to be within the physically viable range under the present

M_{\odot}$, the fundamental-mode frequency is approximately $2.5$ kHz for the
energy density scale $\epsilon_{s}=23.2037$ GeV/fm$^{3}$ of the holographic SS

vehicles in the presence of static and moving obstacles. The proposed procedure
is based on a new form of local parametrized guidance vector fields, called
collision avoidance vector fields, that produce smooth and intuitive maneuvers
around obstacles. The maneuvers follow nominal collision-free paths which we
refer to as streamlines of the collision avoidance vector fields. In the case
of multiple obstacles, the proposed procedure determines a mixed vector field
that blends the collision avoidance vector field of each obstacle and assumes
its form whenever a pre-defined distance threshold is reached. Then, in
accordance to the computed guidance vector fields, different collision
avoidance controllers that generate collision-free maneuvers are developed.
Furthermore, it is shown that any tracking controller with convergence
guarantees can be used with the avoidance controllers to track the streamlines
of the collision avoidance vector fields. Finally, numerical simulations
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach and its ability to avoid
collisions with static and moving pop-up threats in three different practical
scenarios.

features that resemble those of thixotropy. This issue has been debated in the
literature over the past several decades, and several experimental protocols
have been proposed to distinguish thixotropy from viscoelasticity. In this
work, we assess these protocols by carrying out experiments using polymer
solutions, thixotropic clay dispersions, and modeling their behavior,
respectively, using the FENE-P constitutive equation and a viscoelastic aging
model. We find that the criteria proposed in the literature, such as a step
down jump in the shear rate and shear startup at different waiting times
elapsed since preshear, are inadequate to distinguish thixotropy from
viscoelasticity. In marked contrast, we show that the application of
step-strain or step-stress after cessation of the preshear serves as a useful
discriminant between thixotropy and viscoelasticity. In thixotropic materials,
we observe that the application of step strain (or step stress) after cessation
of the preshear eventually leads to slowing down of relaxation dynamics as a
function of waiting time. However, for viscoelastic materials, the relaxation
modulus (creep compliance) curve shifts to lower modulus (higher compliance)
values as a function of waiting time until equilibrium is reached. While the
proposed criterion offers a robust distinction between viscoelasticity and
thixotropy for the systems studied here, further experimental investigations
based on other systems are needed to establish its versatility and will lead to
a greater insight into this long-standing issue in rheological categorization.

paper addresses bias issues with post-hoc explanations to provide a trustable
prediction of whether a person will receive future criminal charges given one's
previous criminal records by learning temporal behavior patterns over twenty
years. Bi-LSTM relieves the vanishing gradient problem, attentional mechanisms
allow learning and interpretation of feature importance, and complex-valued
networks inspired quantum physics to facilitate a certain level of transparency
in modeling the decision process. Our approach shows a consistent and reliable
prediction precision and recall on a real-life dataset. Our analysis of the
importance of each input feature shows the critical causal impact on
decision-making, suggesting that criminal histories are statistically
significant factors, while identifiers, such as race and age, are not. Finally,
our algorithm indicates that a suspect tends to rather than suddenly increase

stochastic model that unifies and generalizes previous approaches to the
subject. Viewing a given population of individuals or groups of individuals
with given health state attributes as living in and moving between the nodes of
a graph, we use Monte-Carlo Markov Chain techniques to simulate the movements
and health state changes of the individuals according to given probabilities of
stay that have been preassigned to each of the nodes. We utilize this model to
either capture and predict the future geographic evolution of an epidemic in
time, or the evolution of an epidemic inside a heterogeneous population which
is divided into homogeneous sub-populations, or, more generally, its evolution
in a combination or superposition of the previous two contexts. We also prove
that when the size of the population increases and a natural hypothesis is
satisfied, the stochastic process associated to our model converges to a
deterministic process. Indeed, when the length of the time step used in the
discrete model converges to zero, in the limit this deterministic process is
driven by a differential equation yielding the evolution of the expectation
value of the number of infected as a function of time. In the second part of
the paper, we apply our model to study the evolution of the Covid-19 epidemic.
We deduce a decomposition of the function yielding the number of infectious
individuals into ""wavelets"", which allows to trace in time the expectation
value for the number of infections inside each sub-population. Within this
framework, we also discuss possible causes for the occurrence of multiple
epidemiological waves.

second-order nonlinear parametric processes play an important role in quantum
photonic technology, and chip-scale realization of these processes is
recognized as the key to building efficient light sources for integrated
quantum photonic circuits. To achieve ultra-high nonlinear conversion
efficiency, traditional method uses quasi-phase matching (QPM) technology.
However, QPM requires electric field poling, which is incompatible with the
CMOS fabrication process, and this hinders the wafer-scale production of
integrated photonic circuits. In this paper, we demonstrate efficient
spontaneous quasi-phase matched (SQPM) frequency conversion in a
micro-racetrack resonator. Our approach does not involve poling, but exploits
the anisotropy of the ferroelectric crystals to allow the phase-matching
condition to be fulfilled spontaneously as the TE-polarized light circulates in
a specifically designed racetrack resonator. SQPM second harmonic generation is
observed with a normalized intracavity conversion efficiency of 0.85%/W,
corresponding to the 111st-order QPM. This could theoretically reach 186,000%/W
by first-order QPM. In this case such high intracavity conversion efficiency
can be implemented in practice with an optimized outward coupling. Our
configurable SQPM approach will benefit the application of nonlinear frequency
conversion in chip-scale integrated photonics with CMOS-compatible fabrication
processes, and is applicable to other on-chip nonlinear processes such as
quantum frequency conversion or frequency-comb generation.

experimental demonstration of a 3 x 3 directionally-unbiased linear optical

demonstration using bulk optical elements which works only with light sources
with a long coherence length, our experimental directionally-unbiased 3 x 3

the region populated by X-ray binaries. We selected candidates using
narrow-band imaging aimed at the line excess and identified six (and possibly a

selection. Five of them have radio counterparts, including the radio supernova
SN2008iz, which was discovered as a radio transient in 2008. It shows a hard
X-ray spectrum with a blueshifted Fe K feature with v ~ -2700 km/s, both of
which suggest its youth. The 4-8 keV luminosities of the selected SNRs are in
the range of (0.3-3)e38 erg/s. We made a crude estimate of the supernova rate,
assuming that more luminous SNRs are younger, and found 0.06 (0.03-0.13) /yr,
in agreement with the supernova rates estimated by radio observations and the
generally believed star formation rate of M82, although the validity of the
assumption is questionable. A sum of the Fe xxv luminosity originating from the

from image-text pairs and serves for downstream vision-language tasks in a
fine-tuning fashion. The dominant VLP models adopt a CNN-Transformer
architecture, which embeds images with a CNN, and then aligns images and text
with a Transformer. Visual relationship between visual contents plays an
important role in image understanding and is the basic for inter-modal
alignment learning. However, CNNs have limitations in visual relation learning
due to local receptive field's weakness in modeling long-range dependencies.
Thus the two objectives of learning visual relation and inter-modal alignment
are encapsulated in the same Transformer network. Such design might restrict
the inter-modal alignment learning in the Transformer by ignoring the
specialized characteristic of each objective. To tackle this, we propose a
fully Transformer visual embedding for VLP to better learn visual relation and
further promote inter-modal alignment. Specifically, we propose a metric named
Inter-Modality Flow (IMF) to measure the interaction between vision and
language modalities (i.e., inter-modality). We also design a novel masking
optimization mechanism named Masked Feature Regression (MFR) in Transformer to
further promote the inter-modality learning. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first study to explore the benefit of Transformer for visual feature
learning in VLP. We verify our method on a wide range of vision-language tasks,
including Image-Text Retrieval, Visual Question Answering (VQA), Visual
Entailment and Visual Reasoning. Our approach not only outperforms the
state-of-the-art VLP performance, but also shows benefits on the IMF metric.

the gap function and specific heat $C_V (T)$ of such nematic superconductor. We
specifically address three issues: (i) angular dependence of the gap in light
of the competition between nematicity-induced $s$-$d$ mixture and orbital
transmutation of low-energy excitations in the nematic state, (ii) the effect
of nematicity on the magnitude of the jump of the specific heat $C_V (T)$ at

potential transition at $T_{c1} < T_c$ from an $s+d$ state to an $s + e^{i\eta}
d$ state that breaks time-reversal symmetry. We consider two scenarios for a
nematic order: scenario A, in which this order develops between $d_{xz}$ and
$d_{yz}$ orbitals on hole and electron pockets and scenario B, in which there

to decide whether the transmitted identifier is its identifier, rather than
decoding the identifier. This model allows to transmit identifiers whose size
scales doubly-exponentially in the blocklength, unlike common transmission (or
channel) codes whose size scales exponentially. It suffices to use binary
constant-weight codes (CWCs) to achieve the ID capacity. By relating the
parameters of a binary CWC to the minimum distance of a code and using
higher-order correlation moments, two upper bounds on the binary CWC size are
proposed. These bounds are shown to be upper bounds also on the identifier
sizes for ID codes constructed by using binary CWCs. We propose two code
constructions based on optical orthogonal codes, which are used in optical
multiple access schemes, have constant-weight codewords, and satisfy cyclic
cross-correlation and auto-correlation constraints. These constructions are
modified and concatenated with outer Reed-Solomon codes to propose new binary
CWCs optimal for ID. Improvements to the finite-parameter performance of both
our and existing code constructions are shown by using outer codes with larger
minimum distance vs. blocklength ratios. We also illustrate ID performance
regimes for which our ID code constructions perform significantly better than

  null distribution-free approach for multiple testing in the following

at hand a sample drawn from this null distribution. In practical situations,
this null training sample (NTS) can come from previous experiments, from a part
of the data under test, from specific simulations, or from a sampling process.
In this work, we present theoretical results that handle such a framework, with
a focus on the false discovery rate (FDR) control and the Benjamini-Hochberg
(BH) procedure. First, we provide upper and lower bounds for the FDR of the BH
procedure based on empirical $p$-values. These bounds match when $\alpha
(n+1)/m$ is an integer, where $n$ is the NTS sample size and $m$ is the number
of tests. Second, we give a power analysis for that procedure suggesting that
the price to pay for ignoring the null distribution is low when $n$ is

the sparse structure of the estimated precision matrix in the previous
iteration. As a result, our algorithm is capable of handling datasets with very
high dimensions that may go beyond the capacity of the existing methods.
Moreover, for the sub-problem in each iteration, other than solving the primal
problem directly, we develop a semismooth Newton augmented Lagrangian algorithm
with global linear convergence rate on the dual problem to improve the
efficiency. Theoretical properties of our proposed algorithm have been
established. In particular, we show that the convergence rate of our algorithm

applications, with comparison to several state-of-the-art solvers.

optimal mistake bound in the non-private case, up to a logarithmic factor.
Moreover, for general values of the Littlestone dimension $d$, the same mistake
bound holds but with a doubly-exponential in $d$ factor. A recent line of work
has demonstrated a strong connection between classes that are online learnable

demonstrate its advantage for matrix decomposition, imputation of missing

social media activity. Our framework achieves 28% reduction in RMSE compared to
baselines for temporal interpolation when as many as 75% of the observations
are missing. It scales best among baselines taking under 20 seconds on 3.5

that the empirical WDNs may realize a reasonable balance between cost,

However, global models designed to describe as many materials as possible might
overlook the very few compounds that have the appropriate adsorption properties
to be suitable for a given catalytic process. Here, the subgroup-discovery
(SGD) local artificial-intelligence approach is used to identify the key
descriptive parameters and constrains on their values, the so-called SG rules,
which particularly describe transition-metal surfaces with outstanding
adsorption properties for the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions. We
start from a data set of 95 oxygen adsorption energy values evaluated by
density-functional-theory calculations for several monometallic surfaces along

adsorption energies within the Sabatier-optimal range required for the oxygen
reduction reaction and (ii) present the largest deviations from the linear
scaling relations between O and OH adsorption energies, which limit the

cascading processes in pulsar magnetospheres, have been proposed to explain the
pulsar radio emission. In order to verify this hypothesis, we utilized for the
first time Particle-in-Cell (PIC-) code simulations to study the nonlinear
evolution of electron-positron bunches in dependence on the relative drift
speeds of electrons and positrons, on the initial plasma temperature, and on
the initial distance between the bunches. For this sake, we utilized the
PIC-code ACRONYM with a high-order field solver and particle weighting factor,
appropriate to describe relativistic pair plasmas. We found that the bunch
expansion is mainly determined by the relative electron-positron drift speed.
Finite drift speeds were found to cause the generation of strong electric
fields that reach up to $E \sim 7.5 \times 10^{5}$ V/cm ($E / (m_\mathrm{e} c
\omega_\mathrm{p} e^{-1}) \sim 4.4$) and strong plasma heating. As a result, up
to 15~\% of the initial kinetic energy is transformed into the electric field
energy. Assuming the same electron- and positron-distributions we found that
the fastest (in the bunch reference frame) particles of consecutively emitted
bunches eventually overlap in the momentum (velocity) space. This overlap
causes two-stream instabilities that generate (electrostatic) subluminal L-mode
waves with electric field amplitudes reaching up to $E \sim 1.9\times 10^{4}$
V/cm ($E / (m_\mathrm{e} c \omega_\mathrm{p} e^{-1}) \sim 0.11$). We found that
the interaction of electron-position bunches leads to plasma heating, to the

pulsars in the radio wave range.

However, the magnitude of the PGE photocurrent is usually small, leading to a
low photoresponsivity, and therefore hampers its practical application in
photodetection. Here, we propose an approach to largely enhancing the PGE
photocurrent by applying an inhomogenous mechanical stretch, based on quantum
transport simulations. We model a two-dimensional photodetector consisting of
the wide-bandgap MgCl$_2$/ZnBr$_2$ vertical van der Waals heterojunction with
the noncentrosymmetric $C_{3v}$ symmetry. Polarization-sensitive PGE
photocurrent is generated under the vertical illumination of linearly polarized
light. By applying inhomogenous mechanical stretch on the lattice, the
photocurrent can be largely increased by up to 3 orders of magnitude due to the
significantly increased device asymmetry. Our results propose an effective way
to enhance the PGE by inhomogenous mechanical strain, showing the potential of
the MgCl$_2$/ZnBr$_2$ vertical heterojunction in the low-power UV
photodetection.

  disadvantaged prey through Parrondo's paradox",,,,,"q-bio.PE nlin.CD","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Dormancy is a costly adaptive strategy that is widespread among living
organisms inhabiting diverse environments. We explore mathematical models of
predator-prey systems, in order to assess the impact of prey dormancy on the
competition between two types of prey, a perennially active (PA) and capable of
entering dormancy (dormitive). Both the active form and the dormant form of the
dormitive prey are individually at a disadvantage compared to the PA prey and
would go extinct due to their low growth rate, energy waste on the production
of dormant prey, and inability of the latter to grow autonomously. However, the
dormitive prey can paradoxically outcompete the PA prey with superior traits
and even cause its extinction by alternating between the two losing strategies.
This outcome recapitulates the game-theoretic Parrondo's paradox, where two
losing strategies combine to achieve a winning outcome. We observed higher
fitness of the dormitive prey in rich environments because a large predator
population in a rich environment cannot be supported by the prey without
adopting an evasive strategy, that is, dormancy. In such environments,
populations experience large-scale fluctuations, which can be survived by
dormitive but not by PA prey. Dormancy of the prey appears to be a natural
evolutionary response to self-destructive over-predation that stabilizes
evolving predator-prey systems through Parrondo's paradox.

Johansson","Navigating A Mobile Robot Using Switching Distributed Sensor Networks",,,,,"cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper proposes a method to navigate a mobile robot by estimating its
state over a number of distributed sensor networks (DSNs) such that it can
successively accomplish a sequence of tasks, i.e., its state enters each
targeted set and stays inside no less than the desired time, under a
resource-aware, time-efficient, and computation- and communication-constrained
setting.We propose a new robot state estimation and navigation architecture,
which integrates an event-triggered task-switching feedback controller for the
robot and a two-time-scale distributed state estimator for each sensor. The
architecture has three major advantages over existing approaches: First, in
each task only one DSN is active for sensing and estimating the robot state,
and for different tasks the robot can switch the active DSN by taking resource
saving and system performance into account; Second, the robot only needs to
communicate with one active sensor at each time to obtain its state information
from the active DSN; Third, no online optimization is required. With the
controller, the robot is able to accomplish a task by following a reference
trajectory and switch to the next task when an event-triggered condition is
fulfilled. With the estimator, each active sensor is able to estimate the robot
state. Under proper conditions, we prove that the state estimation error and
the trajectory tracking deviation are upper bounded by two time-varying
sequences respectively, which play an essential role in the event-triggered
condition. Furthermore, we find a sufficient condition for accomplishing a task
and provide an upper bound of running time for the task. Numerical simulations
of an indoor robot's localization and navigation are provided to validate the
proposed architecture.

Results indicate that for decreasing particulate sizes, approaching radii equal
to or less than the range of the $\alpha$-particle within the fuel, there is a
significant increase in the rate of energy emitted per unit mass of fuel
material. The influence of geometry is more significant for smaller radii,
showing clear differences in dose rate curves below 50 $\mu$m. These
considerations are essential for any future accurate prediction of the

accounted for in climate models. Unfortunately, direct measurements of this
quantity over long periods do not exist. The only observation related to solar
activity whose records reach back to the seventeenth century are sunspots.
Surprisingly, determining the number of sunspots consistently over time has
remained until today a challenging statistical problem. It arises from the need
of consolidating data from multiple observing stations around the world in a
context of low signal-to-noise ratios, non-stationarity, missing data,
non-standard distributions and many kinds of errors. The data from some
stations experience therefore severe and various deviations over time. In this
paper, we propose the first systematic and thorough statistical approach for
monitoring these complex and important series. It consists of three steps
essential for successful treatment of the data: smoothing on multiple
timescales, monitoring using block bootstrap calibrated CUSUM charts and
classifying of out-of-control situations by support vector techniques. This
approach allows us to detect a wide range of anomalies (such as sudden jumps or
more progressive drifts), unseen in previous analyses. It helps us to identify
the causes of major deviations, which are often observer or equipment related.
Their detection and identification will contribute to improve future
observations. Their elimination or correction in past data will lead to a more
precise reconstruction of the world reference index for solar activity: the
International Sunspot Number.

  Conference (GLOBECOM)",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of beam alignment (BA) in a cell-free massive multiple-input
multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system operating at millimeter wave (mmWaves)
carrier frequencies is considered in this paper. Two estimation algorithms are
proposed, in association with a protocol that permits simultaneous estimation,
on a shared set of frequencies, for each user equipment (UE), of the direction
of arrival and departure of the radio waves associated to the strongest
propagation paths from each of the surrounding access points (APs), so that
UE-AP association can take place. The proposed procedure relies on the
existence of a reliable control channel at sub-6 GHz frequency, so as to enable
exchange of estimated values between the UEs and the network, and assumes that
APs can be identifies based on the prior knowledge of the orthogonal channels
and transmit beamforming codebook. A strategy for assigning codebook entries to
the several APs is also proposed, with the aim of minimizing the mutual
interference between APs that are assigned the same entry. Numerical results
show the effectiveness of the proposed detection strategy, thus enabling one
shot fast BA for CF-mMIMO systems.

wherein one must repeatedly make an appropriate choice from a set of
alternatives. Multiple expert judgements, whether human or artificial, can help
in taking correct decisions, especially when exploration of alternative
solutions is costly. As expert opinions might deviate, the problem of finding
the right alternative can be approached as a collective decision making problem
(CDM) via aggregation of independent judgements. Current state-of-the-art
approaches focus on efficiently finding the optimal expert, and thus perform
poorly if all experts are not qualified or if they are overly biased, thereby
potentially derailing the decision-making process. In this paper, we propose a
new algorithmic approach based on contextual multi-armed bandit problems (CMAB)
to identify and counteract such biased expertise. We explore homogeneous,
heterogeneous and polarised expert groups and show that this approach is able
to effectively exploit the collective expertise, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods, especially when the quality of the provided expertise degrades. Our
novel CMAB-inspired approach achieves a higher final performance and does so
while converging more rapidly than previous adaptive algorithms.

  with Dependent Components",,,,,"stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Accelerated degradation testing (ADT) is one of the major approaches in
reliability engineering which allows accurate estimation of reliability
characteristics of highly reliable systems within a relatively short time. The
testing data are extrapolated through a physically reasonable statistical model
to obtain estimates of lifetime quantiles at normal use conditions. The Gamma
process is a natural model for degradation, which exhibits a monotone and
strictly increasing degradation path. In this work, optimal experimental
designs are derived for ADT with two response components. We consider the
situations of independent as well as dependent marginal responses where the
observational times are assumed to be fixed and known. The marginal degradation
paths are assumed to follow a Gamma process where a copula function is utilized
to express the dependence between both components. For the case of independent
response components the optimal design minimizes the asymptotic variance of an
estimated quantile of the failure time distribution at the normal use
conditions. For the case of dependent response components the $D$-criterion is
adopted to derive $D$-optimal designs. Further, $D$- and $c$-optimal designs
are developed when the copula-based models are reduced to bivariate binary
outcomes.

Biologically plausible classic actor-critic agents have been shown to learn to

this computational study, we show versions of classic agents that learn to

The limitation is overcome by an agent in which place cell and cue information
are first processed by a feedforward nonlinear hidden layer with synapses to
the actor and critic subject to temporal difference error-modulated plasticity.
Faster learning is obtained when the feedforward layer is replaced by a
recurrent reservoir network.

modularity maximization strategies, which rely on some form of aggregation of

the same community structure, and in the noisy case, where some layers
represent only noise.

of humans supported by a computer alerting tool can be improved by tailoring
the tool's alerting threshold (sensitivity/specificity combination) according
to user ability and task difficulty. Background: Many researchers implicitly
assume that for each tool there exists a single ideal threshold. But research
shows the effects of alerting tools on decision errors to vary depending on
variables such as user ability and task difficulty. These findings motivated
our investigation. Method: Forty-seven participants edited text passages, aided
by a simulated spell-checker tool. We experimentally manipulated passage
difficulty and tool alerting threshold, measured participants' editing and
dictation ability, and counted participants' decision errors (false positives +
false negatives). We investigated whether alerting threshold, user ability,
task difficulty and their interactions affected error count. Results: Which
alerting threshold better helped a user depended on an interaction between user
ability and passage difficulty. Some effects were large: for higher ability
users, a more sensitive threshold reduced errors by 30%, on the easier
passages. Participants were not significantly more likely to prefer the
alerting threshold with which they performed better. Conclusion: Adjusting
alerting thresholds for individual users' ability and task difficulty could
substantially improve effects of automated alerts on user decisions. This
potential deserves further investigation. Improvement size and rules for
adjustment will be application-specific. Application: Computer alerting tools
have critical roles in many domains. Designers should assess potential benefits
of adjustable alerting thresholds for their specific CAT application. Guidance
for choosing thresholds will be essential for realizing these benefits in
practice.

every stage in the signal processing pipeline, including data acquisition,

systems are still built upon the classical Nyquist-based periodic signal
acquisition. In this work, we design and validate the Polygonal Approximation
Sampler (PAS), a novel circuit to implement a general-purpose event-based
sampler using a polygonal approximation algorithm as the underlying sampling
trigger. The circuit can be dynamically reconfigured to produce a coarse or a
detailed reconstruction of the analog input, by adjusting the error threshold
of the approximation. The proposed circuit is designed at the Register Transfer
Level and processes each input sample received from the ADC in a single clock
cycle. The PAS has been tested with three different types of archetypal signals
captured by wearable devices (electrocardiogram, accelerometer and respiration
data) and compared with a standard periodic ADC. These tests show that
single-channel signals, with slow variations and constant segments (like the
used single-lead ECG and the respiration signals) take great advantage from the
used sampling technique, reducing the amount of data used up to 99% without
significant performance degradation. At the same time, multi-channel signals
(like the six-dimensional accelerometer signal) can still benefit from the
designed circuit, achieving a reduction factor up to 80% with minor performance
degradation. These results open the door to new types of wearable sensors with
reduced size and higher battery lifetime.

and variability on a vast range of temporal and spatial scales. Attaining a
deeper level of understanding of its dynamical processes is a scientific
challenge of great urgency, especially given the ongoing climate change and the
evolving climate crisis. In statistical physics, complex, many-particle systems
are studied successfully using the mathematical framework of Large Deviation
Theory (LDT). A great potential exists for applying LDT to problems relevant
for geophysical fluid dynamics and climate science. In particular, LDT allows
for understanding the fundamental properties of persistent deviations of
climatic fields from the long-term averages and for associating them to
low-frequency, large scale patterns of climatic variability. Additionally, LDT
can be used in conjunction with so-called rare events algorithms to explore
rarely visited regions of the phase space and thus to study special dynamical
configurations of the climate. These applications are of key importance to
improve our understanding of high-impact weather and climate events.
Furthermore, LDT provides powerful tools for evaluating the probability of
noise-induced transitions between competing metastable states of the climate
system or of its components. This in turn essential for improving our
understanding of the global stability properties of the climate system and of
its predictability of the second kind in the sense of Lorenz. The goal of this
review is manifold. First, we want to provide an introduction to the derivation
of large deviation laws in the context of stochastic processes. We then relate
such results to the existing literature showing the current status of
applications of LDT in climate science and geophysical fluid dynamics. Finally,
we propose some possible lines of future investigations.

result shows that the shadow radius decreases with the increase of the electric
charge. The quasinormal modes are derived by the sixth WKB approximation method
and shadow radius, respectively. For the fixed electric charge and multipole
number, the values of the real and imaginary parts of the quasinormal modes
decrease with the increase of the quintessence charge. When the value of the
multipole number is large, the quasinormal modes derived by the two methods are
consistent, which shows the correspondence between the quasinormal modes in the

Coherence Tomography (OCT) is the quintessential imaging technique for its

detection, in this paper, we propose, for the first time, a novel framework for
glaucoma grading using raw circumpapillary B-scans. In particular, we set out a
new OCT-based hybrid network which combines hand-driven and deep learning
algorithms. An OCT-specific descriptor is proposed to extract hand-crafted
features related to the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL). In parallel, an
innovative CNN is developed using skip-connections to include tailored residual
and attention modules to refine the automatic features of the latent space. The
proposed architecture is used as a backbone to conduct a novel few-shot
learning based on static and dynamic prototypical networks. The k-shot paradigm
is redefined giving rise to a supervised end-to-end system which provides
substantial improvements discriminating between healthy, early and advanced
glaucoma samples. The training and evaluation processes of the dynamic
prototypical network are addressed from two fused databases acquired via
Heidelberg Spectralis system. Validation and testing results reach a
categorical accuracy of 0.9459 and 0.8788 for glaucoma grading, respectively.
Besides, the high performance reported by the proposed model for glaucoma
detection deserves a special mention. The findings from the class activation
maps are directly in line with the clinicians' opinion since the heatmaps
pointed out the RNFL as the most relevant structure for glaucoma diagnosis.

both clinical practice and pathological studies. However, multiple reasons such
as morphological variations of nuclei or cells make it a challenging task where
conventional object detection methods cannot obtain satisfactory performance in
many cases. A detection task consists of two sub-tasks, classification and
localization. Under the condition of dense object detection, classification is
a key to boost the detection performance. Considering this, we propose
similarity based region proposal networks (SRPN) for nuclei and cells detection
in histology images. In particular, a customized convolution layer termed as
embedding layer is designed for network building. The embedding layer is added
into the region proposal networks, enabling the networks to learn
discriminative features based on similarity learning. Features obtained by
similarity learning can significantly boost the classification performance
compared to conventional methods. SRPN can be easily integrated into standard
convolutional neural networks architectures such as the Faster R-CNN and
RetinaNet. We test the proposed approach on tasks of multi-organ nuclei
detection and signet ring cells detection in histological images. Experimental
results show that networks applying similarity learning achieved superior
performance on both tasks when compared to their counterparts. In particular,
the proposed SRPN achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MoNuSeg benchmark
for nuclei segmentation and detection while compared to previous methods, and
on the signet ring cell detection benchmark when compared with baselines. The

microwave resonance, and demonstrate a regime where almost all collisional
ionization of Rydberg atoms can be traced back to a prior non-adiabatic

the excitation and measurement scheme considered here renders non-adiabatic

expressed (as for spheroids or ellipsoids), the gravitational force and mutual
gravitational potential can be formulated as a surface integral instead of a
volume integral, and solved numerically. If the two bodies are infinitely thin
disks, the surface integral has an analytical solution. The method is exact as
the force and mutual potential appear in closed-form expressions, and does not
involve series expansions with subsequent truncation errors. In order to test
the method, we solve the equations of motion in an inertial frame, and run
simulations with two spheroids and two infinitely thin disks, restricted to
torque-free planar motion. The resulting trajectories display precession
patterns typical for non-Keplerian potentials. We follow the conservation of
energy and orbital angular momentum, and also investigate how the spheroid
model approaches the two cases where the surface integral can be solved

incidence and mortality. Currently, two subtypes are known based on tumour
growth: non-muscle invasive (NMIBC) and muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC).
In this work, we focus on the MIBC subtype because it is of the worst prognosis
and can spread to adjacent organs. We present a self-learning framework to
grade bladder cancer from histological images stained via immunohistochemical
techniques. Specifically, we propose a novel Deep Convolutional Embedded
Attention Clustering (DCEAC) which allows classifying histological patches into
different severity levels of the disease, according to the patterns established
in the literature. The proposed DCEAC model follows a two-step fully
unsupervised learning methodology to discern between non-tumour, mild and
infiltrative patterns from high-resolution samples of 512x512 pixels. Our
system outperforms previous clustering-based methods by including a
convolutional attention module, which allows refining the features of the
latent space before the classification stage. The proposed network exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches by 2-3% across different metrics, achieving a final
average accuracy of 0.9034 in a multi-class scenario. Furthermore, the reported
class activation maps evidence that our model is able to learn by itself the
same patterns that clinicians consider relevant, without incurring prior
annotation steps. This fact supposes a breakthrough in muscle-invasive bladder
cancer grading which bridges the gap with respect to train the model on
labelled data.

text-moment pairs are used as positive pairs, whereas other pairs are regarded
as negative pairs. However, aside from the ground-truth pairs, some text-moment
pairs should be regarded as positive. In this case, one text annotation can be
positive for many video moments. Conversely, one video moment can be
corresponded to many text annotations. Thus, there are many-to-many
correspondences between the text annotations and video moments. Based on these
correspondences, we can form potentially relevant pairs, which are not given as
ground truth yet are not negative; effectively incorporating such relevant
pairs into training can improve the retrieval performance. The text query
should describe what is happening in a video moment. Hence, different video
moments annotated with similar texts, which contain a similar action, are
likely to hold the similar action, thus these pairs can be considered as
potentially relevant pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel training method

significant research subjects in the field of materials science. Despite a more
than 50-year history of their study, there are still many open questions. The
main challenge in studying interfacial structures is the extreme complexity of
their experimental and theoretical observation and description. The presence of
phase-like states at grain boundaries called complexions requires even more
effort in their study. Here, we demonstrate the effect of grain boundaries on
the properties of polycrystalline minerals on the example of the
$\Sigma$5[310](001) grain boundary in periclase (MgO). Using the combination of
extended evolutionary algorithm USPEX and modern machine-learning interatomic
potentials, we explore the configuration space of the specified grain boundary
and predict its possible phase-like states. In addition to the widely studied
CSL-type structure, we found several stable GB complexions with various atomic
densities at the boundary plane. Analysis of grain boundary excess volume of
the structures revealed the successive stages of GB failure under the tensile
applied in the normal direction of the boundary plane. Our results demonstrate
that interfacial chemistry and structural diversity can be surprisingly rich
even in seemingly simple and thoroughly investigated materials. The phenomena
we observe here are not specific to MgO and should be general.

Our benchmarking exercises show that for almost all the cases, the model we use
is able to reproduce observations at the field scale. Calibrated friction
angles are almost similar to that used in other models and the shape of the
final deposits is in good agreement with observation. However, as it is tricky

different friction angles used for each cases figure out the limits of using
such model as long as constitutive equations for granular media are not known.

quantum systems that evolve unitarily according to the Schr\""odinger equation.
The dynamics of an open quantum system are typically classified into Markovian
and non-Markovian, depending on whether the dynamics can be decomposed into
valid quantum operations at any time scale. Since Markovian evolutions are
easier to simulate, compared to non-Markovian dynamics, it is reasonable to
assume that non-Markovianity can be employed for useful quantum-technological
applications. Here, we demonstrate the usefulness of non-Markovianity for
preserving correlations and coherence in quantum systems. For this, we consider
a broad class of qubit evolutions, having a decoherence matrix separated from
zero for large times. While any such Markovian evolution leads to an
exponential loss of correlations, non-Markovianity can help to preserve
correlations even in the limit $t \rightarrow \infty$. For covariant qubit
evolutions, we also show that non-Markovianity can be used to preserve quantum
coherence at all times, which is an important resource for quantum metrology.
We explicitly demonstrate this effect experimentally with linear optics, by
implementing the required evolution that is non-Markovian at all times.

times is challenging due to a highly stochastic traffic environment. Public
transport users are particularly sensitive to unexpected waiting times, which
negatively affect their perception on the system's reliability. In this paper
we develop a robust model for real-time bus travel time prediction that depart
from Gaussian assumptions by using Student-$t$ errors. The proposed approach
uses spatiotemporal characteristics from the route and previous bus trips to
model short-term effects, and date/time variables and Gaussian processes for
long-run forecasts. The model allows for flexible modeling of mean, variance
and kurtosis spaces. We propose algorithms for Bayesian inference and for
computing probabilistic forecast distributions. Experiments are performed using
data from high-frequency buses in Stockholm, Sweden. Results show that
Student-$t$ models outperform Gaussian ones in terms of log-posterior
predictive power to forecast bus delays at specific stops, which reveals the
importance of accounting for predictive uncertainty in model selection.
Estimated Student-$t$ regressions capture typical temporal variability between
within-day hours and different weekdays. Strong spatiotemporal effects are
detected for incoming buses from immediately previous stops, which is in line
with many recently developed models. We finally show how Bayesian inference
naturally allows for predictive uncertainty quantification, e.g. by returning
the predictive probability that the delay of an incoming bus exceeds a given
threshold.

automatically identify the best model, and the best set of parameters for a
given graph. To do so, most authors rely on the minimum description length
paradigm, and apply it to graphs by considering the entropy of probability
distributions defined on graph ensembles. In this paper, we introduce edge
probability sequential inference, a new approach to perform model selection,
which relies on probability distributions on edge ensembles. From a theoretical
point of view, we show that this methodology provides a more consistent ground
for statistical inference with respect to existing techniques, due to the fact
that it relies on multiple realizations of the random variable. It also
provides better guarantees against overfitting, by making it possible to lower
the number of parameters of the model below the number of observations.
Experimentally, we illustrate the benefits of this methodology in two
situations: to infer the partition of a stochastic blockmodel, and to identify
the most relevant model for a given graph between the stochastic blockmodel and

  Hierarchical Least-Squares Programs","17 pages, 7 figures",,,,"math.OC cs.CC cs.NA cs.PF cs.RO cs.SY eess.SY math.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Hierarchical least-squares programs with linear constraints (HLSP) are a type
of optimization problem very common in robotics. Each priority level contains
an objective in least-squares form which is subject to the linear constraints
of the higher priority hierarchy levels. Active-set methods (ASM) are a popular
choice for solving them. However, they can perform poorly in terms of
computational time if there are large changes of the active set. We therefore
propose a computationally efficient primal-dual interior-point method (IPM) for
HLSP's which is able to maintain constant numbers of solver iterations in these
situations. We base our IPM on the null-space method which requires only a
single decomposition per Newton iteration instead of two as it is the case for
other IPM solvers. After a priority level has converged we compose a set of
active constraints judging upon the dual and project lower priority levels into
their null-space. We show that the IPM-HLSP can be expressed in least-squares
form which avoids the formation of the quadratic Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)
Hessian. Due to our choice of the null-space basis the IPM-HLSP is as fast as
the state-of-the-art ASM-HLSP solver for equality only problems.

formulation, is not affected by locking, as it is based on the stresses as main
unknowns. Thus it is quite attractive for nearly incompressible and
incompressible materials. Discretization with mixed finite elements will lead
to -- possibly large -- linear saddle point systems with a particular
structure. Whereas efficient multigrid methods exist for solving problems in
mixed plane elasticity, to the knowledge of the authors, no multigrid methods
are readily available for the general dual formulation. Two are the main
challenges in constructing a multigrid method for the dual formulation for
linear elasticity. First, in the incompressible limit, the matrix block related
to the stress is semi-positive definite. Second, the stress belongs to
$\textbf{H}_{\text{div}}$ and standard smoothers, working for $\textbf{H}^1$
regular problems, cannot be applied. We present a novel patch-based smoother
for the dual formulation for linear elasticity. We discuss different types of
local boundary conditions for the patch subproblems. Based on our

conductance curves from SPCS are described by a two-gap $s$-wave model, a
single $s$-wave gap reasonably captures the MPCS data, likely due to a
diminishing spectral weight of the other gap. The enhanced superconductivity
probably arises from local strain caused by the point-contact, which also leads

important goal of nanotechnology research and there is considerable progress

cantilever, the force sensor in AFM measurements, plays a pivotal role in
quantitative estimates of nano-scale viscoelasticity. The point-mass
model,wherein the AFM cantilever is approximated as a point mass with mass-less
spring is widely used in dynamic AFM analysis and its validity, particularly in
liquid environments, is debated. It is suggested that the cantilever must be
treated as a continuous rectangular beam to obtain accurate estimates of
nano-scale viscoelasticity of materials it is probing. Here, we derived
equations, which relate stiffness and damping coefficient of the material under
investigation to measured parameters, by approximating cantilever as a point
mass and also considering the full geometric details. These equations are
derived for both tip-excited as well as base excited cantilevers. We have
performed off-resonance dynamic atomic force spectroscopy on a single protein
molecule to investigate the validity of widely used point-mass model. We
performed measurements with AFMs equipped with different cantilever excitation
methods as well as detection schemes to measure cantilever response. The data
was analyzed using both, continuous-beam model and the point-mass model. We
found that both models yield same results when the experiments are performed in
truly off-resonance regime with small amplitudes and the cantilever stiffness
is much higher than the interaction stiffness. Our findings suggest that a
simple point-mass approximation based model is adequate to describe the
dynamics, provided care is taken while performing experiments so that the
approximations used in these models are valid.

particular, DeepLoc leverages the ubiquitous cellular signals received from the
different cell towers heard by the mobile device as hints to localize it. To do
that, crowd-sensed geo-tagged received signal strength information coming from
different cell towers is used to train a deep model that is used to infer the
user's position. As part of DeepLoc design, we introduce modules to address a
number of practical challenges including scaling the data collection to large
areas, handling the inherent noise in the cellular signal and geo-tagged data,
as well as providing enough data that is required for deep learning models with
low-overhead.
  We implemented DeepLoc on different Android devices. Evaluation results in
realistic urban and rural environments show that DeepLoc can achieve a median
localization accuracy within 18.8m in urban areas and within 15.7m in rural
areas. This accuracy outperforms the state-of-the-art cellular-based systems by
more than 470% and comes with 330% savings in power compared to the GPS. This

In this work, we develop a statistical framework that incorporates a
probabilistic modeling technique using a fully Bayesian approach to perform a
quantitative uncertainty-aware validation. A Bayesian perspective on a
validation task yields an optimal bias-variance trade-off against the reference
data. It provides an integrative metric for model validation that incorporates
parameter and conceptual uncertainty. Additionally, a surrogate modeling
technique, namely Bayesian Sparse Polynomial Chaos Expansion, is employed to
accelerate the computationally demanding Bayesian calibration and validation.
We apply this validation framework to perform a comparative evaluation of
models for coupling a free flow with a porous-medium flow. The correct choice
of interface conditions and proper model parameters for such coupled flow
systems is crucial for physically consistent modeling and accurate numerical
simulations of applications. We develop a benchmark scenario that uses the
Stokes equations to describe the free flow and considers different models for
the porous-medium compartment and the coupling at the fluid--porous interface.
These models include a porous-medium model using Darcy's law at the
representative elementary volume scale with classical or generalized interface
conditions and a pore-network model with its related coupling approach. We
study the coupled flow problems' behaviors considering a benchmark case, where
a pore-scale resolved model provides the reference solution. With the suggested
framework, we perform sensitivity analysis, quantify the parametric
uncertainties, demonstrate each model's predictive capabilities, and make a

circular cross section of diameter $d_c$=6 and 8 mm) from a silo with a
rotating bottom and a circular orifice of diameter $D$. In the small orifice
range ($D/d<5$) clogs are mostly broken by the rotating base, and the flow is
intermittent with avalanches and temporary clogs. Here
$d\equiv(\frac{3}{2}d_c^2L)^{1/3}$ is the effective grain diameter. Unlike for
spherical grains, for rods the flow rate $W$ clearly deviates from the power
law dependence $W\propto (D-kd)^{2.5}$ at lower orifice sizes in the
intermittent regime, where $W$ is measured in between temporary clogs only.
Instead, below about $D/d<3$ an exponential dependence $W\propto e^{\kappa D}$
is detected. Here $k$ and $\kappa$ are constants of order unity. Even more
importantly, rotating the silo base leads to a strong -- more than 50% --
decrease of the flow rate, which otherwise does not depend significantly on the
value of $\omega$ in the continuous flow regime. In the intermittent regime,
$W(\omega)$ appears to follow a non-monotonic trend, although with considerable
noise. A simple picture, in terms of the switching from funnel flow to mass
flow and the alignment of the pegs due to rotation, is proposed to explain the
observed difference between spherical and elongated grains. We also observe
shear induced orientational ordering of the pegs at the bottom such that their
long axes in average are oriented at a small angle $\langle\theta\rangle
\approx 15^\circ$ to the motion of the bottom.

linear kinematic features at the same mesh than the vertex discretization.
However, the discretization based on cell and edge velocities suffer from
kernels in the strain rate or stress divergence operators and need either
special strain rate computations as proposed here for cell velocities, or
stabilization as proposed earlier for edge velocities. An elementary Fourier
analysis clarifies how kernels are removed, and also shows that cell and edge
velocity placement leads to spurious branches of stress divergence operator
with large negative eigenvalues. Although spurious branches correspond to fast
decay and are not expected to distort sea ice dynamics, they demand either
smaller internal time steps or higher stability parameters in explicit EVP-like

Identifying the disease-causing mutations from millions of genetic variants

network. However, existing variant effect prediction models only consider a
variant in isolation. In contrast, we propose VEGN, which models variant effect
prediction using a graph neural network (GNN) that operates on a heterogeneous
graph with genes and variants. The graph is created by assigning variants to
genes and connecting genes with an gene-gene interaction network. In this
context, we explore an approach where a gene-gene graph is given and another
where VEGN learns the gene-gene graph and therefore operates both on given and
learnt edges. The graph neural network is trained to aggregate information
between genes, and between genes and variants. Variants can exchange
information via the genes they connect to. This approach improves the
performance of existing state-of-the-art models.

dependent on bioinformatics processing, which is often too demanding for
clinicians and researchers without a computational background. Another problem
represents the reproducibility of computational analyses across separated
computational centers with inconsistent versions of installed libraries and
bioinformatics tools.
  Results: We propose an easily extensible set of computational pipelines,
called SnakeLines, for processing sequencing reads; including mapping,
assembly, variant calling, viral identification, transcriptomics, metagenomics,
and methylation analysis. Individual steps of an analysis, along with methods
and their parameters can be readily modified in a single configuration file.
Provided pipelines are embedded in virtual environments that ensure isolation
of required resources from the host operating system, rapid deployment, and
reproducibility of analysis across different Unix-based platforms.
  Conclusion: SnakeLines is a powerful framework for the automation of

structural topology optimization, employing an in-house developed finite
element convolutional neural network (FE-CNN). Our approach can be divided into
two stages: offline training, and online optimization. During offline training,
a mapping function is built between high and low resolution representations of
a given design domain. The mapping is expressed by a FE-CNN, which targets a
common objective function value (e.g., structural compliance) across design
domains of differing resolutions. During online optimization, an arbitrary
design domain of high resolution is reduced to low resolution through the
trained mapping function. The original high-resolution domain is thus designed
by computations performed on only the low-resolution version, followed by an
inverse mapping back to the high-resolution domain. Numerical examples
demonstrate that this approach can accelerate optimization by up to an order of
magnitude in computational time. Our proposed approach therefore shows great
potential to overcome the curse-of-dimensionality incurred by density-based
structural topology optimization. The limitation of our present approach is
also discussed.

boson with a mass near 125 GeV, we study the aforementioned Higgs boson pair
production channels and investigate their bosonic decays, such as $H^\pm \to
W^{\pm } h$ and/or $H^\pm \to W^{\pm } A$. We demonstrate that for a light
charged Higgs boson state, with $m_{H^\pm}\lesssim m_t$, at the LHC, such
di-Higgs production and decay channels can give rise to signatures with event
rates much larger than those emerging from $pp\to t\bar{t}\to t\bar{b} H^-$ +

therefore, claim that the discussed combination of new production and decay
modes can result in an alternative discovery channel for charged Higgs bosons
lighter than the top (anti)quark at the LHC within the above two 2HDM Types.
Finally, in order to motivate experimentalists in ATLAS and CMS to search for
such signatures, we propose 16 Benchmark Points (BPs) which are compatible with

rapidly, astronomers in different fields and with different backgrounds can
have the need to get a quick idea of which GW source populations can be
detected by which detectors and with what measurement uncertainties.
  Aims. The GW-Toolbox is an easy-to-use, flexible tool to simulate
observations on the GW universe with different detectors, including
ground-based interferometers (advanced LIGO, advanced VIRGO, KAGRA, Einstein
Telescope, and also customised designs), space-borne interferometers (LISA and
a customised design), pulsar timing arrays mimicking the current working ones
(EPTA, PPTA, NANOGrav, IPTA) and future ones. We include a broad range of
sources such as mergers of stellar mass compact objects, namely black holes,
neutron stars and black hole-neutron stars; and supermassive black hole
binaries mergers and inspirals, Galactic double white dwarfs in ultra-compact
orbit, extreme mass ratio inspirals and Stochastic GW backgrounds.
  Methods. We collect methods to simulate source populations and determine
their detectability with the various detectors. The paper aims at giving a
comprehensive description on the algorithm and functionality of the GW-Toolbox.
  Results. The GW-Toolbox produces results that are consistent with more
detailed calculations of the different source classes and can be accessed with
a website interface (gw-universe.org) or as a python package
(https://bitbucket.org/radboudradiolab/gwtoolbox). In the future, it will be
upgraded with more functionality.

localization. However, it requires an initial calibration phase during which
the fingerprint database is built manually. This process is labour intensive
and needs to be repeated with any change in the environment. While a number of
systems have been introduced to reduce the calibration effort through RF
propagation models or crowdsourcing, these still have some limitations. Other
approaches use the recently developed iBeacon technology as an alternative to
WiFi for indoor localization. However, these beacon-based solutions are limited
to a small subset of high-end phones. In this paper, we present HybridLoc: an
accurate low-overhead indoor localization system. The basic idea HybridLoc
builds on is to leverage the sensors of high-end phones to enable localization
of lower-end phones. Specifically, the WiFi fingerprint is crowdsourced by
opportunistically collecting WiFi-scans labeled with location data obtained
from BLE-enabled high-end smart phones. These scans are used to automatically
construct the WiFi-fingerprint, that is used later to localize any lower-end
cell phone with the ubiquitous WiFi technology. HybridLoc also has provisions
for handling the inherent error in the estimated BLE locations used in
constructing the fingerprint as well as to handle practical deployment issues
including the noisy wireless environment, heterogeneous devices, among others.
Evaluation of HybridLoc using Android phones shows that it can provide accurate
localization in the same range as manual fingerprinting techniques under the
same conditions. Moreover, the localization accuracy on low-end phones
supporting only WiFi is comparable to that achieved with high-end phones
supporting BLE. This accuracy is achieved with no training overhead, is robust
to the different user devices, and is consistent under environment changes.

semiconductor laser mode-locking. While there have been several investigations
of the ultrafast gain dynamics in vertical-external-cavity surface-emitting
lasers (VECSELs), little is known about the associated refractive index
changes. Yet, such refractive index changes do not only have a profound impact
on the pulse formation process leading to self-phase modulation, which needs to
be compensated by dispersion, but they are also of particular relevance for
assessing the feasibility of Kerr-lens mode-locking of VECSELs. Here, we
measure both refractive index as well as gain dynamics of a VECSEL chip using
the ultrafast beam deflection method. We find that, in contrast to the gain
dynamics, the refractive index dynamics is dominated by an instantaneous
($\sim$100~fs) and a very slow component ($\sim$100~ps). The time-resolved
measurement of nonlinear refraction allows us to predict a pulse-length
dependent, effective nonlinear refractive index $n_{2,eff}$, which is shown to
be negative and in the order of $10^{-16}$ $m^2/W$ for short pulse lengths
($\sim$100~fs) . It becomes positive for large excitation fluences and large
pulse lengths (few ps). These results agree with some previous reports of
self-mode-locked VECSELs for which the cavity design and pulse properties
determine sign and strength of the nonlinear refractive index when assuming
Kerr-lens mode-locking.

navigating in dense human crowds, failure of which could lead to either
overaggressive or overcautious behavior. A necessary condition for cooperative
collision avoidance is to couple the prediction of the agents' trajectories
with the planning of the robot's trajectory. However, it is unclear that
trajectory based cooperative collision avoidance captures the correct agent
attributes. In this work we migrate from trajectory based coupling to a
formalism that couples agent preference distributions. In particular, we show
that preference distributions (probability density functions representing
agents' intentions) can capture higher order statistics of agent behaviors,
such as willingness to cooperate. Thus, coupling in distribution space exploits
more information about inter-agent cooperation than coupling in trajectory
space. We thus introduce a general objective for coupled prediction and
planning in distribution space, and propose an iterative best response
optimization method based on variational analysis with guaranteed sufficient
decrease. Based on this analysis, we develop a sampling-based motion planning
framework called DistNav that runs in real time on a laptop CPU. We evaluate
our approach on challenging scenarios from both real world datasets and
simulation environments, and benchmark against a wide variety of model based
and machine learning based approaches. The safety and efficiency statistics of
our approach outperform all other models. Finally, we find that DistNav is
competitive with human safety and efficiency performance.

players do not perceive collisions directly, and propose the Error-Correction
Collision Communication (EC3) algorithm that models implicit communication as a
reliable communication over noisy channel problem, for which random coding
error exponent is used to establish the optimal regret that no communication

decoding error rate leads to a regret that approaches the centralized MP-MAB

the superiority of EC3. In particular, the results show that the choice of

social interactions such as online social networks. Here, we demonstrate that
the topology of an online social network can be used to characterize the

personality traits, inferred from their self-reported domains of interest

DOIs by topological similarity exposed two main self-emergent DOI groups that
were in alignment with the personality meta-traits plasticity and stability.
Closeness, a global topological measure of network centrality, was
significantly higher for bloggers associated with plasticity (vs. stability). A
local network motif (a triad of 3 connected bloggers) that correlated with
closeness also separated the personality meta-traits. Finally, topology-based
classification of DOIs (without analyzing the content of the blogs) attained >
70% accuracy (average AUC of the test-set). These results indicate that
personality traits are evident and detectable in network topology. This has
serious implications for user privacy. But, if used responsibly, network
identification of personality traits could aid in early identification of

transmitted model updates have to be clipped before adding privacy noise. Such
clipping operation is substantially different from its counterpart of gradient
clipping in the centralized differentially private SGD and has not been
well-understood. In this paper, we first empirically demonstrate that the
clipped FedAvg can perform surprisingly well even with substantial data
heterogeneity when training neural networks, which is partly because the
clients' updates become similar for several popular deep architectures. Based
on this key observation, we provide the convergence analysis of a differential
private (DP) FedAvg algorithm and highlight the relationship between clipping
bias and the distribution of the clients' updates. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that rigorously investigates theoretical and

the wind-field interaction, and can yield quantitative estimates of the wind

the formation of UV resonance lines in slowly rotating magnetic massive stars

synthetic UV line profiles. Using a grid of models, we examine the effect of

gradient of -0.099 ${\pm}$ 0.031 dex kpc$^{-1}$ for [M/H] and +0.023 ${\pm}$
0.009 dex kpc for the [Mg/Fe] abundance. The steeper [Mg/Fe] gradient than that
found in the literature is a result of the improvement of the AMBRE [Mg/Fe]
estimates in the metal-rich regime. In addition, we find a significant spread
of stellar age at any given [Mg/Fe] value, and observe a clear correlated
dispersion of the [Mg/Fe] abundance with metallicity at a given age. While for
[M/H] < -0.2, a clear age-[Mg/Fe] trend is observed, more metal-rich stars
display ages from 3 up to 12 Gyr, describing an almost flat trend in the
[Mg/Fe]-age relation. Moreover, we report the presence of radially migrated
stars for a wide range of stellar ages, although we note the large
uncertainties of the amplitude of the inferred change in orbital guiding radii.
Finally, we observe the appearance of a second chemical sequence in the outer
disc, 10-12 Gyr ago, populating the metal-poor, low-[Mg/Fe] tail. These stars
are more metal-poor than the coexisting stellar population in the inner parts
of the disc, and show lower [Mg/Fe] abundances than prior disc stars of the
same metallicity, leading to a chemical discontinuity. Our data favour the
rapid formation of an early disc that settled in the inner regions, followed by
the accretion of external metal-poor gas -- probably related to a major
accretion event such as the Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage one -- that may have
triggered the formation of the thin disc population and steepened the abundance
gradient in the early disc.

obtaining a high-quality dense correspondence between the two. In both
contexts, the quality of our results enables us to target real applications
such as texture transfer and shape interpolation. Furthermore, we also show
that including an estimation of the underlying density of the surface eases the
learning process. By exploiting the potential of this architecture, we can
train our model requiring only a sparse set of ground truth correspondences

fields are represented using an Eulerian approach with the dispersed phase
modelled using the Fast-Eulerian method (Ferry & Balachandar 2001) that
includes the droplet rise velocity. Radial concentration profiles and turbulent
concentration fluxes for droplets of different sizes are analyzed to quantify
the ""trajectory crossing effect"", when relative motions between particles and
turbulent eddies tend to reduce turbulent diffusion. For finer LES grid
resolutions, the model captures the differential, size based dispersion
characteristics of the droplets with the transverse dispersion of the larger
droplet sizes suppressed, since trajectory crossing effects are explicitly
resolved in LES. We examine a similarity solution model for the size dependent
radial concentration profiles based on a modified Schmidt number derived from
the theory of turbulent diffusion of particles in the atmosphere proposed by
Csanady 1963. The results are validated with the high resolution LES data and
show good agreement. Then, the size dependent Schmidt number model is
reformulated as a model for unresolved subgrid-scale trajectory crossing

a turbulent jet, with slightly buoyant droplets injected at the centerline in
the self-similar region of the jet. The results are compared to a simulation

turn helps reducing model complexity and increasing model interpretation.
Usually, existing structured PCA methods require prior knowledge to construct
the regularization term. However, the proposed FGSPCA can simultaneously
capture the grouping and/or sparse structures of factor loadings without any
prior information. To solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we
propose an alternating algorithm that incorporates the difference-of-convex

from teacher model to the student model with frame-level and sequence-level

Various dynamic models are introduced that enable one to add time-dependence to

first approach, the Gaussian field is decomposed into localised waves that are
allowed to fluctuate in time or to move, either ballistically or diffusively.
In a second approach, a dispersion relation is used to make the spectral
components of the field time-dependent. The various models lead to
qualitatively different dynamics, which can be discriminated by neutron
scattering. The methods of the paper are illustrated with oil/water
microemulsion studied by small-angle scattering and neutron spin-echo. All

the network during training about transformations of the input data that keep
the label unchanged. Manually finding adequate augmentation methods and
parameters for a given pipeline is however rapidly cumbersome. In particular,
while intuition can guide this decision for images, the design and choice of
augmentation policies remains unclear for more complex types of data, such as
neuroscience signals. Besides, class-dependent augmentation strategies have
been surprisingly unexplored in the literature, although it is quite intuitive:
changing the color of a car image does not change the object class to be
predicted, but doing the same to the picture of an orange does. This paper
investigates gradient-based automatic data augmentation algorithms amenable to
class-wise policies with exponentially larger search spaces. Motivated by
supervised learning applications using EEG signals for which good augmentation
policies are mostly unknown, we propose a new differentiable relaxation of the
problem. In the class-agnostic setting, results show that our new relaxation
leads to optimal performance with faster training than competing gradient-based
methods, while also outperforming gradient-free methods in the class-wise
setting. This work proposes also novel differentiable augmentation operations
relevant for sleep stage classification.

not be sensitive enough to the various change in pose and shape of subjects,

to introduce the label information of subjects, e.g., pose and type of objects

Therefore, we develop a new cyclic weight-sharing mechanism for token

We call our result the d-dimensional Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (ddKS) and provide
three novel contributions therewith: we develop an analytical equation for the
significance of a given ddKS score, we provide an algorithm for computation of
ddKS on modern computing hardware that is of constant time complexity for small
sample sizes and dimensions, and we provide two approximate calculations of
ddKS: one that reduces the time complexity to linear at larger sample sizes,
and another that reduces the time complexity to linear with increasing
dimension. We perform power analysis of ddKS and its approximations on a corpus
of datasets and compare to other common high dimensional two sample tests and
distances: Hotelling's T^2 test and Kullback-Leibler divergence. Our ddKS test
performs well for all datasets, dimensions, and sizes tested, whereas the other
tests and distances fail to reject the null hypothesis on at least one dataset.

scheduling problem in device-to-device (D2D) networks on Riemannian manifold.
The link scheduling problem can be considered as a binary classification
problem since each D2D pair can only hold the state active or inactive. Our
goal is to learn a novel metric that facilitates the design of an efficient but
less computationally demanding machine learning (ML) solution for the binary
classification task of link scheduling problem that requires no channel state
information (CSI) and a fewer number of training samples as opposed to other
benchmark ML algorithms. To this aim, we first represent the wireless D2D
network as a graph and model the features of each D2D pair, including its
communication and interference links, as regularized (i.e., positively-shifted)
Laplacian matrices which are symmetric positive definite (SPD) one. By doing
so, we represent the feature information of each D2D pair as a point on the SPD
manifold, and we analyze the topology through Riemannian geometry. We compute
the Riemannian metric, e.g., Log-Euclidean metric (LEM), which are suitable
distance measures between the regularized Laplacian matrices. The LEM is then
utilized to define a positive definite graph kernel for the binary
classification of the link scheduling decisions. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed graph Kernel-based method is computationally less demanding
and achieves a sum rate of more than 95% of benchmark algorithm FPLinQ [1] for
10 D2D pairs without using CSI and less than a hundred training network

explicit measurement semantics by exposing the spin bit to measure a flow's

implements and evaluates four currently proposed measurement techniques (L-,

Second, the generator's prediction tends to be over-confident along with

Specifically, we augment sampling with a hardness prediction mechanism, so that
the generator can encourage the discriminator to learn what it has not

post-hoc calibrations are two types of approaches that have individually shown
promise in improving the uncertainty calibration of DNNs. However, the
synergistic effect of the two types of methods has not been well explored. In
this paper, we propose a truth discovery framework to integrate ensemble-based

candidates as a good indicator for sample uncertainty, we design an
accuracy-preserving truth estimator with provably no accuracy drop.
Furthermore, we show that post-hoc calibration can also be enhanced by truth
discovery-regularized optimization. On large-scale datasets including CIFAR and

Slater determinant state) as approximating functions for bosons, with the
intention to develop variational methods based upon them. For a system of $N$
identical bosons, a permanent state is constructed by taking a set of $N$
arbitrary (not necessarily orthonormal) single-particle orbitals, forming their
product and then symmetrizing it. It is found that for the one-dimensional
Bose-Hubbard model with the periodic boundary condition and at unit filling,
the exact ground state can be very well approximated by a permanent state, in
that the permanent state has high overlap (at least 0.96 even for 12 particles
and 12 sites) with the exact ground state and can reproduce both the ground
state energy and the single-particle correlators to high precision. For a
generic model, we have devised a greedy algorithm to find the optimal set of
single-particle orbitals to minimize the variational energy or maximize the
overlap with a target state. It turns out that quite often the ground state of
a bosonic system can be well approximated by a permanent state by all the
criterions of energy, overlap, and correlation functions. And even if the error
is apparent, it can often be remedied by including more configurations, i.e.,
by allowing the variational wave function to be a combination of multiple
permanent states. The algorithm is used to study the stability of a
two-particle system, with great success. All these suggest that permanent
states are very effective as variational wave functions for bosonic systems,
and hence deserve further studies.

knowledge distillation (KD) processes. Unlike traditional pruning and KD, PQK
makes use of unimportant weights pruned in the pruning process to make a
teacher network for training a better student network without pre-training the
teacher model. PQK has two phases. Phase 1 exploits iterative pruning and
quantization-aware training to make a lightweight and power-efficient model. In
phase 2, we make a teacher network by adding unimportant weights unused in
phase 1 to a pruned network. By using this teacher network, we train the pruned
network as a student network. In doing so, we do not need a pre-trained teacher
network for the KD framework because the teacher and the student networks
coexist within the same network. We apply our method to the recognition model
and verify the effectiveness of PQK on keyword spotting (KWS) and image
recognition.

(TMDs) have emerged as a superlative class of materials for several
applications in electronic devices, energy storage devices, gas sensing, etc.,
and they have recently attracted great attention, owing to their good catalytic
activity and excellent stability toward electrochemical H2 Evolution Reaction
(HER). Each individual layer of the TMDs consists of three atomic layers in
which the transition metal is sandwiched by two chalcogens. To activate the
inert basal plane of the pristine 2D TMDs, it is needed to create some defects
or doping of some heteroatoms in the pristine TMDs. Phase engineering
techniques have been used to activate the basal plane of the 2D TMDs. In this
article, we have computationally developed 2D monolayer Mn-MoS$_2$ material and
its application in HER. Stable S terminated edge of the MoS$_2$ shows low
catalytic activity due to its inert basal plane, so to exploit these edges for
improved performance we doped Mn in the pristine MoS$_2$ material. Using
trailblazing and state of the art first principles-based density functional
theory we performed methodical and rigorous inspection of electronic structures
and properties of monolayer Mn doped MoS$_2$ to be a promising alternative to
noble metal-based catalysts for HER. Periodic 2D slab of Mn-MoS$_2$ was created
to study the electronic properties and the reaction pathway occurring on the
surface of the material has been delved into by creating Mn$_1$Mo$_9$S$_{21}$
molecular cluster model. Our study reveals that the 2D Mn-MoS$_2$ monolayer
based catalyst follows the Volmer-Heyrovsky reaction with very low energy
barriers during the HER mechanism. This study is focused on designing a low
cost and efficient electrocatalyst for HER by using earth abundant TMDs and
lowering the activation barriers by scrutinizing the kinetics of the reaction
for reactivity.

  system","33 pages, 22 figures",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  One of the most relevant challenges regarding on-demand ridepooling relates
to the spatial imbalances of the demand, which induce a mismatch between the
position of the vehicles and the origins of the emerging requests. Most
ridepooling models face this problem through rebalancing methods only, i.e.,
moving idle vehicles towards areas with high rejections rate, which is done
independently from routing and vehicle-to-orders assignments, so that vehicles
serving passengers (a large portion of the total fleet) remain unaffected. This
paper introduces two types of techniques for anticipatory routing that affect
how vehicles are assigned to users and how to route vehicles to serve such
users, so that the whole operation of the system is modified to reach more
efficient states for future requests. Both techniques do not require any
assumption or exogenous knowledge about the future demand, as they depend only
on current and recent requests. Firstly, we introduce rewards that reduce the
cost of an assignment between a vehicle and a group of passengers if the
vehicle gets routed towards a high-demand zone. Secondly, we include a small
set of artificial requests, whose request times are in the near future and
whose origins are sampled from a probability distribution that mimics observed
generation rates. These artificial requests are to be assigned together with
the real requests.
  We test these techniques using a set of real rides from Manhattan.
Introducing rewards can diminish the rejection rate to about nine-tenths of its
original value. On the other hand, including future requests can reduce users'
traveling times by about one-fifth, but increasing rejections. Both methods
increase the vehicles-hour-traveled by about 10%. Spatial analysis reveals that
vehicles are indeed moved towards the most demanded areas, such that the
reduction in rejections rate is achieved mostly there.

their excellent hyperelastic behaviour. There are various types of constitutive
models for soft materials, and phenomenological models are very popular for
finite element method (FEM) simulations. However, it is not easy to construct a
model that can precisely predict the complex behaviours of soft materials. In
this paper, we suggest that the strain energy functions should be expressed as
functions of ordered principal stretches, which have more flexible expressions
and are capable of matching various experimental curves. Moreover, the feasible
region is small, and simple experiments, such as uniaxial tension/compression
and hydrostatic tests, are on its boundaries. Therefore, strain energy
functions can be easily constructed by the interpolation of experimental
curves, which does not need initial guessing in the form of the strain energy
function as most existing phenomenological models do. The proposed strain
energy functions are perfectly consistent with the available experimental
curves for interpolation. It is found that for incompressible materials, the
function via an interpolation from two experimental curves can already predict
other experimental curves reasonably well. To further improve the accuracy,
additional experiments can be used in the interpolation.

impact of content launches on acquisition. Customers buy subscriptions, not
individual pieces of content, and once subscribed they may consume many pieces
of content in addition to the one(s) that drew them to the service. In this
paper, we propose a scalable methodology to estimate the incremental
acquisition impact of content launches in a subscription business model when
randomized experimentation is not feasible. Our approach uses simple
assumptions to transform the problem into an equivalent question: what is the
expected consumption rate for new subscribers who did not join due to the
content launch? We estimate this counterfactual rate using the consumption rate
of new subscribers who joined just prior to launch, while making adjustments
for variation related to subscriber attributes, the in-product experience, and
seasonality. We then compare our counterfactual consumption to the actual rate
in order to back out an acquisition estimate. Our methodology provides top-line
impact estimates at the content / day / region grain. Additionally, to enable
subscriber-level attribution, we present an algorithm that assigns specific
individual accounts to add up to the top-line estimate. Subscriber-level
attribution is derived by solving an optimization problem to minimize the
number of subscribers attributed to more than one piece of content, while
maximizing the average propensity to be incremental for subscribers attributed
to each piece of content. Finally, in the absence of definitive ground truth,
we present several validation methods which can be used to assess the
plausibility of impact estimates generated by these methods.

breakdowns when applying the quantum principle to a general covariant or
gravitational system. A quantum theory of spacetime reference frame is proposed
and reviewed. We study the theory by functional method, and show that the trace
anomaly of the theory is closely related to some of the Perelman's functionals.
The functionals may provide us possible links between the trace anomaly and the
cosmological constant. We find that to cancel the trace anomaly at the lab's
scale up to very high energy, a cosmological constant is required which is
consistent with observations. In the framework, an effective theory of gravity
and possible observational effect are also discussed.

equilibria, the divergence of fractional order is proposed to determine the
instability of the equilibria. The bifurcation diagrams versus the fractional
order, and versus one parameter, reveal a strange phenomenon suggesting that
the bifurcation branches generated by initial conditions outside neighborhoods
of unstable equilibria are spurious sets although they look similar with those
generated by initial conditions close to the equilibria. These spurious sets
look ``delayed'' in the considered bifurcation scenario. Once the integration
step-size is reduced, the spurious branches maintain their shapes but tend to
the branches obtained from initial condition within neighborhoods of
equilibria. While the spurious branches move once the integration step size
reduces, the branches generated by the initial conditions near the equilibria
maintain their positions in the considered bifurcation space. This phenomenon
does not depend on the integration-time interval, and repeats in the parameter
bifurcation space.

abandoned, according to a recent survey by Rackspace Technology of 1,870
companies. We propose a new strategic framework, aiSTROM, that empowers
managers to create a successful AI strategy based on a thorough literature
review. This provides a unique and integrated approach that guides managers and
lead developers through the various challenges in the implementation process.
In the aiSTROM framework, we start by identifying the top n potential projects
(typically 3-5). For each of those, seven areas of focus are thoroughly
analysed. These areas include creating a data strategy that takes into account
unique cross-departmental machine learning data requirements, security, and
legal requirements. aiSTROM then guides managers to think about how to put
together an interdisciplinary artificial intelligence (AI) implementation team
given the scarcity of AI talent. Once an AI team strategy has been established,
it needs to be positioned within the organization, either cross-departmental or
as a separate division. Other considerations include AI as a service (AIaas),
or outsourcing development. Looking at new technologies, we have to consider
challenges such as bias, legality of black-box-models, and keeping humans in
the loop. Next, like any project, we need value-based key performance
indicators (KPIs) to track and validate the progress. Depending on the
company's risk-strategy, a SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities,
and threats) can help further classify the shortlisted projects. Finally, we
should make sure that our strategy includes continuous education of employees
to enable a culture of adoption. This unique and comprehensive framework offers
a valuable, literature supported, tool for managers and lead developers.

parameters of a mathematical model based on phase fields for damage and
fracture. Damage mechanics is the part of the continuum mechanics that models
the effects of the micro-defect formation using state variables at the
macroscopic level. The equations that define the model are derived from
fundamental laws of physics and provide important relationships between state
variables. Simulations using the model considered in this work produce good
qualitative and quantitative results, but many parameters must be adjusted to
reproduce a certain material behavior. The identification of model parameters
is considered by solving an inverse problem that uses pseudo-experimental data
to find the values that produce the best fit to the data. We apply a
physics-informed neural network and combine some classical estimation methods
to identify the material parameters that appear in the damage equation of the
model. Our strategy consists of a neural network that acts as an approximating
function of the damage evolution with its output regularized using the residue
of the differential equation. Three stages of optimization seek the best
possible values for the neural network and the material parameters. The
training alternates between the fitting of only the pseudo-experimental data or
the total loss that includes the regularizing terms. We test the robustness of
the method to noisy data and its generalization capabilities using a simple
physical case for the damage model. This procedure deals better with noisy data
in comparison with a PDE-constrained optimization method, and it also provides
good approximations of the material parameters and the evolution of damage.

unraveled spurious observational biases that models fall prey to in the absence
of causality. While language representation models preserve contextual
knowledge within learned embeddings, they do not factor in causal relationships
during training. By blending causal relationships with the input features to an
existing model that performs visual cognition tasks (such as scene
understanding, video captioning, video question-answering, etc.), better
performance can be achieved owing to the insight causal relationships bring
about. Recently, several models have been proposed that have tackled the task
of mining causal data from either the visual or textual modality. However,
there does not exist widespread research that mines causal relationships by
juxtaposing the visual and language modalities. While images offer a rich and
easy-to-process resource for us to mine causality knowledge from, videos are
denser and consist of naturally time-ordered events. Also, textual information
offers details that could be implicit in videos. We propose iReason, a
framework that infers visual-semantic commonsense knowledge using both videos

causal rationalization module to aid the process of interpretability, error
analysis and bias detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of iReason using

There are many proposals in the literature for the next step. The

for not only all by the standard model assumed properties of quarks and leptons

gauge fields, of the Higgs's scalar and Yukawa couplings, but also for the
second quantization postulates of Dirac and for cosmological observations, like
there are the appearance of the dark matter, of matter-antimatter asymmetry,
making several predictions. This theory proposes a simple starting action in $
d\ge (13+1)$ space with fermions interacting with the gravity only, what
manifests in $d=(3+1)$ as the vector and scalar gauge fields, and uses the odd
Clifford algebra objects to describe the internal space of fermions, what
enables that the creation and annihilation operators for fermions fulfill the
anticommutation relations for the second quantized fields without Dirac's
postulates: Fermions single particle states already anticommute. We present in

induces nonlinear corrections to the four-dimensional Maxwell equations, which
however remain second order. Although these corrections do not have effect on
the purely electric or magnetic monopole solutions for pointlike charges, they
affect the dyonic solutions, smoothing the electric field at the origin for
negative values of the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant. We investigate these
solutions in flat space, and then extend them in the presence of gravity,
obtaining charged black hole solutions that generalize the Reissner-Nordstr\""om
metric.
