  https://github.com/yumingj/C2-Matching",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reference-based Super-Resolution (Ref-SR) has recently emerged as a promising
paradigm to enhance a low-resolution (LR) input image by introducing an
additional high-resolution (HR) reference image. Existing Ref-SR methods mostly
rely on implicit correspondence matching to borrow HR textures from reference
images to compensate for the information loss in input images. However,
performing local transfer is difficult because of two gaps between input and
reference images: the transformation gap (e.g. scale and rotation) and the
resolution gap (e.g. HR and LR). To tackle these challenges, we propose
C2-Matching in this work, which produces explicit robust matching crossing
transformation and resolution. 1) For the transformation gap, we propose a
contrastive correspondence network, which learns transformation-robust
correspondences using augmented views of the input image. 2) For the resolution
gap, we adopt a teacher-student correlation distillation, which distills
knowledge from the easier HR-HR matching to guide the more ambiguous LR-HR
matching. 3) Finally, we design a dynamic aggregation module to address the
potential misalignment issue. In addition, to faithfully evaluate the
performance of Ref-SR under a realistic setting, we contribute the
Webly-Referenced SR (WR-SR) dataset, mimicking the practical usage scenario.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed C2-Matching significantly
outperforms state of the arts by over 1dB on the standard CUFED5 benchmark.
Notably, it also shows great generalizability on WR-SR dataset as well as
robustness across large scale and rotation transformations.

post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) binary systems has been well
established. We focus on one such system: IRAS 08544-4431. We present an
interferometric multi-wavelength analysis of the circumstellar environment of
IRAS 08544-4431. The aim is to constrain different contributions to the total
flux in the H, K, L, and N-bands in the radial direction. The data from
VLTI/PIONIER, VLTI/GRAVITY, and VLTI/MATISSE range from the near-infrared,
where the post-AGB star dominates, to the mid-infrared, where the disc
dominates. We fitted two geometric models to the visibility data to reproduce
the circumbinary disc: a ring with a Gaussian width and a flat disc model with
a temperature gradient. The flux contributions from the disc, the primary star
(modelled as a point-source), and an over-resolved component are recovered
along with the radial size of the emission, the temperature of the disc as a
function of radius, and the spectral dependencies of the different components.
The trends of all visibility data were well reproduced with the geometric
models. The near-infrared data were best fitted with a Gaussian ring model
while the mid-infrared data favoured a temperature gradient model. This implies
that a vertical structure is present at the disc inner rim, which we attribute
to a rounded puffed-up inner rim. The N-to-K size ratio is 2.8, referring to a
continuous flat source, analogues to young stellar objects. By combining
optical interferometric instruments operating at different wavelengths we can
resolve the complex structure of circumstellar discs and study the
wavelength-dependent opacity profile. A detailed radial, vertical, and
azimuthal structural analysis awaits a radiative transfer treatment in 3D to
capture all non-radial complexity.

(pNG) dark matter (DM) model. The pNG DM scattering processes with particles in
the thermal bath in the early Universe are suppressed by the small momentum
transfer. As a result, kinetic equilibrium is not maintained, and the
temperature of DM is different from the temperature of the thermal bath at the
freeze-out era. This temperature difference affects the thermal relic abundance
of DM. We investigate the early kinetic decoupling in the Higgs resonance
region, 50 GeV $\lesssim m_\chi \lesssim m_h/2$, where $m_\chi$ is the mass of
the DM, and $m_h/2 \simeq$ 62.5 GeV. We find that the DM-Higgs coupling
determined to obtain the measured value of the DM energy density is
underestimated in the literature. The enhancement in the coupling leads larger
value of the Higgs invisible decay rate. It enlarges the capability to discover
the DM signals from the decay of the Higgs bosons at collider experiments.

a collection of certain $\text{SL}(2, \mathbb{C})$ characters on a given
manifold which serve as the simple object types in the corresponding category.
Chern-Simons invariants and adjoint Reidemeister torsions play a key role in
the construction, and they are related to topological twists and quantum
dimensions, respectively, of simple objects. The modular $S$-matrix is computed
from local operators and follows a trial-and-error procedure. It is currently
unknown how to produce data beyond the modular $S$- and $T$-matrices. There are
also a number of subtleties in the construction which remain to be solved. In
this paper, we consider an infinite family of 3-manifolds, that is, torus
bundles over the circle. We show that the modular data produced by such
manifolds are realized by the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariantization of certain
pointed premodular categories. Here the equivariantization is performed for the
$\mathbb{Z}_2$-action sending a simple (invertible) object to its inverse, also
called the particle-hole symmetry. It is our hope that this extensive class of
examples will shed light on how to improve the program to recover the full data

machine learning. It introduces means that serve as powerful ways to compare
probability distributions with each other, as well as producing optimal
mappings to minimize cost functions. In this survey, we present a brief
introduction and history, a survey of previous work and propose directions of
future study. We will begin by looking at the history of optimal transport and
introducing the founders of this field. We then give a brief glance into the
algorithms related to OT. Then, we will follow up with a mathematical
formulation and the prerequisites to understand OT. These include Kantorovich
duality, entropic regularization, KL Divergence, and Wassertein barycenters.
Since OT is a computationally expensive problem, we then introduce the
entropy-regularized version of computing optimal mappings, which allowed OT
problems to become applicable in a wide range of machine learning problems. In
fact, the methods generated from OT theory are competitive with the current
state-of-the-art methods. We follow this up by breaking down research papers
that focus on image processing, graph learning, neural architecture search,
document representation, and domain adaptation. We close the paper with a small
section on future research. Of the recommendations presented, three main
problems are fundamental to allow OT to become widely applicable but rely
strongly on its mathematical formulation and thus are hardest to answer. Since
OT is a novel method, there is plenty of space for new research, and with more
and more competitive methods (either on an accuracy level or computational
speed level) being created, the future of applied optimal transport is bright
as it has become pervasive in machine learning.

(photon energy of 3.1 eV) induces a strongly nonthermal electron distribution,
terahertz excitation (~4 meV) results in a quasi-thermal perturbation of the
electron population. The pump-induced spin and electron dynamics are
interrogated by the magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE). A deconvolution procedure
allows us to push the time resolution down to 130 fs, even though the driving
terahertz pulse is more than 0.5 ps long. Remarkably, the MOKE signals exhibit
an almost identical time evolution for both optical and terahertz pump pulses,
despite the three orders of magnitude different number of excited electrons. We
are able to quantitatively explain our results using a model based on
quasi-elastic spin-flip scattering. It shows that in the small-perturbation

the excess energy of the electrons, independent of the precise shape of their

the Vela pulsar. The models yield the maximum values of mass, $M$, surface
redshift, $z_a$, and the moment of inertia, $I_{\rm Vela}$ for the Vela pulsar
in the range $M = 3.079M_\odot - 2.263M_\odot$; $z_a = 0.581 - 0.414$ and
$I_{\rm Vela,45} =6.9 - 3.5$ (where $I_{45}=I/10^{45}\rm g{cm}^2$) respectively
for the values of $u = $ 0.30 and 0.25 and for an assigned value of the surface
density, $E_a = 2\times 10^{14}\rm g{cm}^{-3}$ {Ref4}. The values of masses
lower than the above mentioned values ( so called the realistic mass range, $M
= 1.4\pm0.2 M_\odot$, in the literature) but significantly higher than that of
the unrealistic mass range $M \leq 0.5M_\odot$ (obtained for the Vela pulsar in
the literature on the basis of parametrized neutron star (NS) models based on
equations of state (EOSs) of dense nuclear matter {Ref3}) and other parameters
may be obtained likewise for the above mentioned range of the values of $G_h$
corresponding to the values of $u < 0.25$. The models are found to be causally
consistent, gravitational bound and pulsationally stable. The upper bound on
neutron star (NS) mass obtained in this study which is applicable for the Vela
pulsar, in fact, corresponds to the mean value of the upper bound on NS mass
obtained in the classical result {Ref5} and that obtained on the basis of
modern EOSs for neutron star matter {Ref6} and is in a good agreement with the
most recent theoretical estimate {Ref7}.

  Sports Commentary Domain","Accepted at NAACL2021",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the pursuit of natural language understanding, there has been a long
standing interest in tracking state changes throughout narratives. Impressive
progress has been made in modeling the state of transaction-centric dialogues
and procedural texts. However, this problem has been less intensively studied
in the realm of general discourse where ground truth descriptions of states may
be loosely defined and state changes are less densely distributed over
utterances. This paper proposes to turn to simplified, fully observable systems
that show some of these properties: Sports events. We curated 2,263 soccer
matches including time-stamped natural language commentary accompanied by
discrete events such as a team scoring goals, switching players or being
penalized with cards. We propose a new task formulation where, given paragraphs
of commentary of a game at different timestamps, the system is asked to
recognize the occurrence of in-game events. This domain allows for rich
descriptions of state while avoiding the complexities of many other real-world
settings. As an initial point of performance measurement, we include two
baseline methods from the perspectives of sentence classification with temporal
dependence and current state-of-the-art generative model, respectively, and
demonstrate that even sophisticated existing methods struggle on the state
tracking task when the definition of state broadens or non-event chatter
becomes prevalent.

($M_{\ast}$-$V_{\rm DM}$) relation, assuming a scatter independent of any
galaxy property, and the empirical $M_{\rm HI}$ conditional probability
distributions given $M_{\ast}$ for central and satellite galaxies. We find that
the $\langle\log M_{\rm HI}\rangle-\log M_{\rm DM}$ relation is not a monotonic
increasing function. It increases with mass up to $M_{\rm DM}\sim 10^{12}$
$M_{\odot}$, attaining a maximum of $\langle\log(M_{\rm HI}/M_{\odot})\rangle
\sim 9.2$, and at higher (sub)halo masses, $\langle\log(M_{\rm HI})\rangle$
decreases slightly with $M_{\rm DM}$. The scatter around it is also large and
mass dependent. The bivariate $M_{\rm HI}$ and $M_{\rm DM}$ distribution is
broad and bimodal, specially at $M_{\rm DM}\gtrsim 10^{12}$ $M_\odot$, which is
inherited from the input $M_{\rm HI}$ conditional distributions. We also report

The galaxy spatial clustering increases weakly as the $M_{\rm HI}$ threshold
increases. Our HI mock galaxies cluster more in comparison to the blind HI

granular soil, a notoriously challenging terrain to traverse with (wheeled)
robotic systems. Here, we present experimental work on traversing steep,
granular slopes with the dynamically walking quadrupedal robot SpaceBok. To
adapt to the challenging environment, we developed passive-adaptive planar feet
and optimized grouser pads to reduce sinkage and increase traction on planar
and inclined granular soil. Single-foot experiments revealed that a large
surface area of 110cm2 per foot reduces sinkage to an acceptable level even on
highly collapsible soil (ES-1). Implementing several 12mm grouser blades
increases traction by 22% to 66% on granular media compared to grouser-less
designs. Together with a terrain-adapting walking controller, we validate - for
the first time - static and dynamic locomotion on Mars analog slopes of up to
25{\deg}(the maximum of the testbed). We evaluated the performance between
point- and planar feet and static and dynamic gaits regarding stability
(safety), velocity, and energy consumption. We show that dynamic gaits are
energetically more efficient than static gaits but are riskier on steep slopes.
Our tests also revealed that planar feet's energy consumption drastically
increases when the slope inclination approaches the soil's angle of internal
friction due to shearing. Point feet are less affected by slippage due to their
excessive sinkage, but in turn, are prone to instabilities and tripping. We
present and discuss safe and energy-efficient global path-planning strategies
for accessing steep topography on Mars based on our findings.

difficulties arise when measuring correlation functions of operators widely
separated in spacetime: for most correlation functions, an exponentially severe
signal-to-noise problem is encountered as the operators are taken to be widely

issues. First, we define a novel MCMC algorithm based on generative flow-based

approximate samplers for distributions of interest. Independently drawn
flow-based samples are then used as proposals in an asymptotically exact
Metropolis-Hastings Markov chain. We address incorporating symmetries of

an approach to ""deform"" Monte Carlo estimators based on contour deformations
applied to the domain of the path integral. The deformed estimators associated
with an observable give equivalent unbiased measurements of that observable,
but generically have different variances. We define families of deformed
manifolds for lattice gauge theories and introduce methods to efficiently
optimize the choice of manifold (the ""observifold""), minimizing the deformed
observable variance. Finally, we demonstrate that flow-based MCMC can mitigate
critical slowing down and observifolds can exponentially reduce variance in

are merged together taking into account the flow of events across components,
as reflected in the logs. We evaluated PRINS in terms of scalability and
accuracy, using nine datasets composed of logs extracted from publicly

applications. The results show that PRINS can process large logs much faster
than a publicly available and well-known state-of-the-art tool, without
significantly compromising the accuracy of inferred models.

storage systems are valuable resources available to grid operators for
balancing supply-demand mismatches via load coordination. However, consumer
acceptance of load coordination schemes depends on ensuring quality of service
(QoS), which embodies device-level constraints. Since each device has its own
internal energy state, the effect of QoS on the fleet can be cast as fleet-wide
energy limits within which the aggregate ""state of charge"" (SoC) must be
actively maintained. This requires coordination of DERs that is cognizant of
the SoC, responsive to grid conditions, and depends on fast communication
networks. To that effect, this paper presents a novel real-time grid-and-DER
co-simulation platform for validating advanced DER coordination schemes and
characterizing the capability of such a DER fleet. In particular, we present
how the co-simulation platform is suitable for: i) testing real-time
performance of a large fleet of DERs in delivering advanced grid services,
including frequency regulation; ii) online state estimation to characterize the
corresponding SoC of a large fleet of DERs; and iii) incorporating practical
limitations of DERs and communications and analyzing the effects on fleet-wide
performance. To illustrate these benefits of the presented grid-DER
co-simulation platform, we employ the advanced DER coordination scheme called
packetized energy management (PEM), which is a novel device-driven,
asynchronous, and randomizing control paradigm for DERs. A fleet of thousands
of PEM-enabled DERs are then added to a realistic and dynamical model of the
Vermont transmission system to complete validation of the co-simulation
platform.

states of the world based on observations. It triggers additional inferences
relevant to ones task at hand. We model an agents update to its belief of the
world based on individual observations using a partially observable Markov
decision process (POMDP), a mainstream artificial intelligence (AI) model of
how to act rationally according to beliefs formed through observation. On top
of that, we model pointing as a communicative act between agents who have a
mutual understanding that the pointed observation must be relevant and
interpretable. Our model measures relevance by defining a Smithian Value of
Information (SVI) as the utility improvement of the POMDP agent before and
after receiving the pointing. We model that agents calculate SVI by using the
cognitive theory of Smithian helping as a principle of coordinating separate
beliefs for action prediction and action evaluation. We then import SVI into
rational speech act (RSA) as the utility function of an utterance. These lead
us to a pragmatic model of pointing allowing for contextually flexible
interpretations. We demonstrate the power of our Smithian pointing model by
extending the Wumpus world, a classic AI task where a hunter hunts a monster
with only partial observability of the world. We add another agent as a guide
who can only help by marking an observation already perceived by the hunter
with a pointing or not, without providing new observations or offering any
instrumental help. Our results show that this severely limited and overloaded
communication nevertheless significantly improves the hunters performance. The
advantage of pointing is indeed due to a computation of relevance based on
Smithian helping, as it disappears completely when the task is too difficult or
too easy for the guide to help.

naturally arises: how much quantum speed-up is possible?
  The area of fine-grained complexity allows us to prove optimal lower-bounds
on the complexity of various computational problems, based on the conjectured
hardness of certain natural, well-studied problems. This theory has recently
been extended to the quantum setting, in two independent papers by Buhrman,
Patro, and Speelman (arXiv:1911.05686), and by Aaronson, Chia, Lin, Wang, and
Zhang (arXiv:1911.01973).
  In this paper, we further extend the theory of fine-grained complexity to the
quantum setting. A fundamental conjecture in the classical setting states that
the 3SUM problem cannot be solved by (classical) algorithms in time O(n^{2-a}),
for any a>0. We formulate an analogous conjecture, the Quantum-3SUM-Conjecture,
which states that there exist no sublinear O(n^{1-b})-time quantum algorithms
for the 3SUM problem.
  Based on the Quantum-3SUM-Conjecture, we show new lower-bounds on the time
complexity of quantum algorithms for several computational problems. Most of
our lower-bounds are optimal, in that they match known upper-bounds, and hence
they imply tight limits on the quantum speedup that is possible for these
problems.

challenges that need to be addressed for realizing practical cloud-enabled

including the dense cluster's area fraction, interparticle pressure, and
radius. Our predictions are in good agreement with our Brownian dynamics
simulations. We, then, derive a continuum model to investigate the relationship
between the predicted interparticle pressure, the swim pressure, and the
macroscopic pressure in the momentum equation. We find that formulating the
point-wise macroscopic pressure as the interparticle pressure and modeling the
particle activity through a spatially variant body force -- as opposed to a
volume-averaged swim pressure -- results in consistent predictions of pressure
in both the continuum model and the microscopic theory. This formulation of
pressure also results in nearly zero surface tension for the phase separated
domains, irrespective of activity, stiffness, and area fraction. Furthermore,
using Brownian dynamics simulations and our continuum model, we showed that
both the interface width and surface tension, are intrinsic characteristics of

platforms. These new forms of textual expressions present new challenges to
analyze text given the use of slang, orthographic and grammatical errors, among
others. Along with these challenges, a practical sentiment classifier should be
able to handle efficiently large workloads.
  The aim of this research is to identify which text transformations
(lemmatization, stemming, entity removal, among others), tokenizers (e.g.,
words $n$-grams), and tokens weighting schemes impact the most the accuracy of
a classifier (Support Vector Machine) trained on two Spanish corpus. The
methodology used is to exhaustively analyze all the combinations of the text
transformations and their respective parameters to find out which
characteristics the best performing classifiers have in common. Furthermore,
among the different text transformations studied, we introduce a novel approach
based on the combination of word based $n$-grams and character based $q$-grams.
The results show that this novel combination of words and characters produces a
classifier that outperforms the traditional word based combination by $11.17\%$
and $5.62\%$ on the INEGI and TASS'15 dataset, respectively.

of radial basis function (RBF) components. An RBF component is a generalization
of the outer product between a pair of vectors, where an RBF function replaces
the scalar multiplication between individual vector elements. Even though the

singular value decomposition (SVD), our proposed nonlinear counterpart
outperforms SVD by drastically reducing the memory required to approximate a

While existing works demonstrated compelling rendering of static scenes and
playback of dynamic scenes, photo-realistic reconstruction and rendering of
humans with neural implicit methods, in particular under user-controlled novel

model as the proxy to unwarp the surrounding 3D space into a canonical pose. A
neural radiance field learns pose-dependent geometric deformations and pose-
and view-dependent appearance effects in the canonical space from multi-view

Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves better quality than the
state-of-the-arts on playback as well as novel pose synthesis, and can even
generalize well to new poses that starkly differ from the training poses.
Furthermore, our method also supports body shape control of the synthesized
results.

Because the strong electromagnetic coupling between the electron and light
leads to the collective excitation of plasmon polaritons, it will manifest as
the plasmonic Doppler effect. Experimental observation of the plasmonic Doppler
effect in electronic system has been challenge because the plasmon propagation
speed is much faster than the electron drift velocity in conventional noble
metals. Here, we report direct observation of Fizeau drag of plasmon polaritons
in strongly biased graphene by exploiting the high electron mobility and the
slow plasmon propagation of massless Dirac electrons. The large bias current in
graphene creates a fast drifting Dirac electron medium hosting the plasmon
polariton. It results in nonreciprocal plasmon propagation, where plasmons
moving with the drifting electron media propagate at an enhanced speed. We
measure the Doppler-shifted plasmon wavelength using a cryogenic near-field
infrared nanoscopy, which directly images the plasmon polariton mode in the
biased graphene at low temperature. We observe a plasmon wavelength difference
up to 3.6% between plasmon moving along and against the drifting electron
media. Our findings on the plasmonic Doppler effect open new opportunities for
electrical control of non-reciprocal surface plasmon polaritons in

the Hylland-Zeckhauser (HZ) mechanism, which has remained a classic in
economics for one-sided matching markets, is intractable; computation of even
an approximate equilibrium is PPAD-complete [Vazirani, Yannakakis 2021], [Chen

[Hosseini and Vazirani 2021] to define a rich collection of
Nash-bargaining-based models for one-sided and two-sided matching markets, in
both Fisher and Arrow-Debreu settings, together with implementations using
available solvers and very encouraging experimental results.
  [Hosseini and Vazirani 2021] raised the question of finding efficient
combinatorial algorithms, with proven running times, for these models. In this

multiplicative weights update (MWU) and conditional gradient descent (CGD).
Additionally, we make the following conceptual contributions to the proposal of

  1) We establish a connection between HZ and Nash-bargaining-based models via
the celebrated Eisenberg-Gale convex program, thereby providing a theoretical
ratification.
  2) Whereas HZ satisfies envy-freeness, due to the presence of demand
constraints, the Nash-bargaining-based models do not. We rectify this to the
extent possible by showing that these models satisfy approximate equal-share
fairness notions.
  3) We define, for the first time, a model for non-bipartite matching markets

evaluate other treatment assignment policies to guide future innovation or

differs from the one used to collect data, and popular estimators, including
doubly robust (DR) estimators, can be plagued by bias, excessive variance, or
both. In particular, when the pattern of treatment assignment in the collected

importance weights used in DR estimators explode, leading to excessive
variance.
  In this paper, we improve the DR estimator by adaptively weighting
observations to control its variance. We show that a t-statistic based on our
improved estimator is asymptotically normal under certain conditions, allowing
us to form confidence intervals and test hypotheses. Using synthetic data and

important challenge that merits the need for provable safety guarantees.
Obtaining such guarantees is nontrivial given the unpredictability of the
interplay of the intruder aircraft decisions, the ownship pilot reactions, and
the subtlety of the continuous motion dynamics of aircraft. Existing collision
avoidance systems, such as TCAS and the Next-Generation Airborne Collision
Avoidance System ACAS X, have been analyzed assuming severe restrictions on the
intruder's flight maneuvers, limiting their safety guarantees in real-world
scenarios where the intruder may change its course. This work takes a
conceptually significant and practically relevant departure from existing ACAS
X models by generalizing them to hybrid games with first-class representations
of the ownship and intruder decisions coming from two independent players,
enabling significantly advanced predictive power. By proving the existence of
winning strategies for the resulting Adversarial ACAS X in differential game
logic, collision-freedom is established for the rich encounters of ownship and
intruder aircraft with independent decisions along differential equations for
flight paths with evolving vertical/horizontal velocities. We present three
classes of models of increasing complexity: single-advisory infinite-time
models, bounded time models, and infinite time, multi-advisory models. Within
each class of models, we identify symbolic conditions and prove that there then
always is a possible ownship maneuver that will prevent a collision between the
two aircraft.

control type I and type II errors. We propose a novel procedure for the
estimation of the change-points based on a wild sequential top-down algorithm

prune a token by blocking its interactions with other tokens. Benefiting from
the nature of self-attention, the unstructured sparse tokens are still hardware

hierarchically pruning 66% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces
31%~37% FLOPs and improves the throughput by over 40% while the drop of

decisions, allowing us to dispense with many of the components common in

long-horizon dynamics prediction, imitation learning, goal-conditioned RL, and

that streams are sensitive to the initial dynamical state of clusters,
accumulated energy gain from encounters with giant molecular clouds (GMCs), and
present-day actions. We investigate what we can learn about the Galactic
potential by studying the feasiblity of rewinding stellar streams back to their
origin. Even with perfect information about the non-axisymmetric components
(spiral arms, bar) of the galactic potential, the stochastic GMC population
makes backwards integration impossible beyond one or two disk orbital times.
Streams are also sensitive to the properties of the bar, but fairly insensitive
to the properties of the non-transient two-armed spiral in our simulation.
Finally we predict that around $10$ to $30$ stellar streams should be
detectable with \textit{Gaia}'s 10-year end-of-mission data. There are many
more stellar streams waiting to be discovered in the Galactic disk, and they
could hold clues about the history of the Galaxy for the past Gyr.

  Regression","ICML 2021. The code is available at https://github.com/FloList/EMPL",,,,"cs.LG astro-ph.IM stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although ubiquitous in the sciences, histogram data have not received much
attention by the Deep Learning community. Whilst regression and classification
tasks for scalar and vector data are routinely solved by neural networks, a
principled approach for estimating histogram labels as a function of an input
vector or image is lacking in the literature. We present a dedicated method for
Deep Learning-based histogram regression, which incorporates cross-bin
information and yields distributions over possible histograms, expressed by
$\tau$-quantiles of the cumulative histogram in each bin. The crux of our
approach is a new loss function obtained by applying the pinball loss to the
cumulative histogram, which for 1D histograms reduces to the Earth Mover's
distance (EMD) in the special case of the median ($\tau = 0.5$), and
generalizes it to arbitrary quantiles. We validate our method with an
illustrative toy example, a football-related task, and an astrophysical
computer vision problem. We show that with our loss function, the accuracy of
the predicted median histograms is very similar to the standard EMD case (and
higher than for per-bin loss functions such as cross-entropy), while the
predictions become much more informative at almost no additional computational
cost.

  Explain the X-ray Excess in GW170817?","5 pages, 2 figures, ApJL",,"10.3847/2041-8213/ac1169",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An excess in the X-ray emission from the neutron star merger GW170817 above
the predicted afterglow was recently detected t~3.4 years post-merger. One
possible origin for the excess is accretion onto the newly unshrouded black
hole (BH) remnant. While fall-back of the bound dynamical ejecta is
insufficient to generate the excess luminosity, L_X ~ 5e38 erg/s, fall-back
from the disk wind ejecta-due to their larger mass and lower velocity-remains a
viable possibility. We present hydrodynamic alpha-viscosity simulations of the
post-merger disk evolution which extend to an unprecedently long timescale t ~
35 s post-merger, as necessary to capture the end of photodissociation and the
asymptotic evolution into the radiatively inefficient regime. Due to
inefficient neutrino cooling, the BH accretion rate decays rapidly at late
times (Mdot_BH ~ t^(-\beta_BH), where \beta_BH ~ 2.4-2.8), seemingly
incompatible with generating the late-time excess. However, the rate at which
matter falls back to the inner disk from the equatorial regions (as inferred by
the rate matter is unbound in outflows by viscous heating at higher latitudes)
decays more gradually, Mdot_fb ~ t^(-\beta_fb) with \beta_fb ~ 1.43 in our
alpha ~ 0.03 simulations. By the present epoch, the fall-back rate has become
sub-Eddington and the disk can again accrete efficiently, i.e. Mdot_BH ~
Mdot_fb, this time as a result of photon cooling instead of neutrino cooling.
The predicted X-ray accretion luminosity at the present epoch is L_X ~ 0.1
Mdot_BH c^2 ~ (2-70)e38 erg/s for beta_FB ~ 1.43-1.66, thus supporting (with
caveats) an accretion-powered origin for the X-ray excess in GW170817. The
suppressed BH accretion rate prior to the radiatively efficient (sub-Eddington)
transition, weeks to months after the merger, is key to avoid overproducing the
kilonova luminosity via reprocessing.

the two populations in the CN distribution and we translated the CN spread into
an internal N variation $\Delta$[N/Fe]$=0.63\pm0.49$ dex. For NGC 1651 and NGC

results from HST photometry, where NGC 1978 was found to host MPs in the form
of N spreads, while slightly younger clusters (e.g. NGC 1783, $<$ 2 Gyr old)

intermediate age massive clusters show lower N abundance variations with
respect to the ancient globular clusters, although this is in part due to the

the possible phase structures of water worlds and find that a diverse range of
interiors are possible, from oceans sandwiched between two layers of ice to
supercritical interiors beneath steam atmospheres. We determine how the bulk
properties and surface conditions of a water world affect its ocean depth,
finding that oceans can be up to hundreds of times deeper than on Earth. For
example, a planet with a 300 K surface can possess H$_2$O oceans with depths
from 30-500 km, depending on its mass and composition. We also constrain the
region of mass-radius space in which planets with H/He envelopes could host
liquid H$_2$O, noting that the liquid phase can persist at temperatures up to
647 K at high pressures of $218$-$7\times10^4$ bar. Such H/He envelopes could
contribute significantly to the planet radius while retaining liquid water at
the surface, depending on the planet mass and temperature profile. Our findings
highlight the exciting possibility that habitable conditions may be present on
planets much larger than Earth.

stars in Taurus to assess the physical mechanisms that induce dipper light
curves. We used the light curves of K2 C4 and C13 to select a dipper sample
among 179 members and possible members of the Taurus star-forming region based
on the light-curve morphology. We studied the periodicities by combining
periodograms with wavelet analysis and derived the stellar parameters from the
photometry. We also studied the morphology of the photometric dips. We find a
dipper occurrence of ~30% in disk-bearing stars observed with K2 that were
identified visually by us. This represents a lower limit to their true
occurrence. About half of the dippers are aperiodic, and most of these are
dominated by another type of variability. The chosen sample is of late spectral
type (K/M), low mass and moderate mass accretion rates and has periods of a few
days. We observed a transient dipper over a few rotation cycles and a dipper
with a changing period. The structure of the dips can be complex and varies
strongly over timescales of down to one stellar rotation. The corotation radii
are located at a few stellar radii, and the temperatures at corotation allow
dust survival. Many of the systems are seen at moderate to high inclination. We
find that the angular extension of the dusty structure producing the dips is
correlated with the stellar period. Magnetospheric accretion, which causes an
accretion column and its base to occult the star, can explain most of the
observed light curves. Although compatible with the model, many of the stellar
inclination angles are moderate and do not exclude mechanisms other than the
occultation by an inner disk warp to account for dipper light curves.

  We extend the Borel determinacy technique of Marks coming from descriptive

technique, we prove deterministic distributed $\Omega(\log n)$-round lower
bounds for problems from a natural class of homomorphism problems.
Interestingly, these lower bounds seem beyond the current reach of the powerful
round elimination technique responsible for all substantial locality lower
bounds of the last years. Our key technical ingredient is a novel ID graph
technique that we expect to be of independent interest.
  We prove that a local problem admits a Baire measurable coloring if and only
if it admits a local algorithm with local complexity $O(\log n)$, extending the
classification of Baire measurable colorings of Bernshteyn. A key ingredient of
the proof is a new and simple characterization of local problems that can be
solved in $O(\log n)$ rounds. We complement this result by showing separations
between complexity classes from distributed computing, finitary factors, and
descriptive combinatorics. Most notably, the class of problems that allow a
distributed algorithm with sublogarithmic randomized local complexity is
incomparable with the class of problems with a Borel solution.
  We hope that our treatment will help to view all three perspectives as part

basis for it goes back to prehistory, in forms such as cave and rock paintings
depicting traces of our distant ancestors. Emergent communication research has
sought to explore how agents can learn to communicate in order to
collaboratively solve tasks. Existing research has focused on language, with a
learned communication channel transmitting sequences of discrete tokens between
the agents. In this work, we explore a visual communication channel between
agents that are allowed to draw with simple strokes. Our agents are
parameterised by deep neural networks, and the drawing procedure is
differentiable, allowing for end-to-end training. In the framework of a
referential communication game, we demonstrate that agents can not only
successfully learn to communicate by drawing, but with appropriate inductive
biases, can do so in a fashion that humans can interpret. We hope to encourage
future research to consider visual communication as a more flexible and
directly interpretable alternative of training collaborative agents.

today's deep net training paradigm of driving cross-entropy (CE) loss towards
zero. During NC, last-layer features collapse to their class-means, both
classifiers and class-means collapse to the same Simplex Equiangular Tight
Frame, and classifier behavior collapses to the nearest-class-mean decision
rule. Recent works demonstrated that deep nets trained with mean squared error
(MSE) loss perform comparably to those trained with CE. As a preliminary, we
empirically establish that NC emerges in such MSE-trained deep nets as well
through experiments on three canonical networks and five benchmark datasets. We
provide, in a Google Colab notebook, PyTorch code for reproducing MSE-NC and
CE-NC: at
https://colab.research.google.com/github/neuralcollapse/neuralcollapse/blob/main/neuralcollapse.ipynb.
The analytically-tractable MSE loss offers more mathematical opportunities than
the hard-to-analyze CE loss, inspiring us to leverage MSE loss towards the
theoretical investigation of NC. We develop three main contributions: (I) We
show a new decomposition of the MSE loss into (A) terms directly interpretable
through the lens of NC and which assume the last-layer classifier is exactly
the least-squares classifier; and (B) a term capturing the deviation from this
least-squares classifier. (II) We exhibit experiments on canonical datasets and
networks demonstrating that term-(B) is negligible during training. This
motivates us to introduce a new theoretical construct: the central path, where
the linear classifier stays MSE-optimal for feature activations throughout the
dynamics. (III) By studying renormalized gradient flow along the central path,
we derive exact dynamics that predict NC.

Hence, most if not all the supernovae (SN) ejecta was not used to form stars.
Here by means of semi-analytic and numerical studies we address this issue
considering both stellar winds and supernovae feedback during the early
evolution of proto-globular clusters. We calculate the ability of stellar winds
to form a global wind that removes the gas left over from star formation. The
innermost radius from which such a global wind can be formed, the superwind
radius $R_{SW}$, is a function of the cloud parameters and the star formation
efficiency. In the case of complete gas expulsion ($R_{\textrm{SW}}=0$), the SN
ejecta merge with shock-heated winds and exit the cluster. On the other hand,
when $R_{\textrm{SW}}>0$, supernova remnants (SNRs) become pressure-confined if
evolving within a critical radius $R_{\textrm{blow}}$, and mix their products
with the residual gas. However, outside of this central zone the SNRs
experience blowout. In such cases, the thermalized ejecta escapes the cluster,
making the SN products unavailable for the formation of new stars. We estimated
the metallicity enhancement ($\Delta\textrm{[Fe/H]}$) of the leftover gas and
discuss the conditions required to produce secondary stellar populations with
$\Delta\textrm{[Fe/H]}$ in the range observed in the majority of GCs.

challenge. Fundamentally, training a neural network via gradient descent is a
parameter estimation problem. In adaptive control, maintaining persistency of
excitation (PoE) is integral to ensuring convergence of parameter estimates in
dynamical systems to their true values. We show that parameter estimation with
gradient descent can be modeled as a sampling of an adaptive linear
time-varying continuous system. Leveraging this model, and with inspiration
from Model-Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC), we prove a sufficient condition
to constrain gradient descent updates to reference persistently excited
trajectories converging to the true parameters. The sufficient condition is
achieved when the learning rate is less than the inverse of the Lipschitz
constant of the gradient of loss function. We provide an efficient technique
for estimating the corresponding Lipschitz constant in practice using extreme
value theory. Our experimental results in both standard and adversarial
training illustrate that networks trained with the PoE-motivated learning rate
schedule have similar clean accuracy but are significantly more robust to
adversarial attacks than models trained using current state-of-the-art
heuristics.

within an experimental volume, in which spatial variations in proton fluence
are a result of deflections to proton trajectories due to interaction with the
fields. When deflections are large, proton trajectories can overlap, and this
nonlinearity creates regions of greatly increased proton fluence on the image,
known as caustics. The formation of caustics has been a persistent barrier to
reconstructing the underlying fields from proton images. We have developed a
new method for reconstructing the path-integrated magnetic fields which begins
to address the problem posed by caustics. Our method uses multiple proton
images of the same object, each image at a different energy, to fill in the
information gaps and provide some uniqueness when reconstructing caustic
features. We use a differential evolution algorithm to iteratively estimate the
underlying deflection function which accurately reproduces the observed proton
fluence at multiple proton energies simultaneously. We test this reconstruction
method using synthetic proton images generated for three different,
cylindrically symmetric field geometries at various field amplitudes and levels
of proton statistics, and present reconstruction results from a set of
experimental images. The method we propose requires no assumption of deflection
linearity and can reliably solve for fields underlying linear, nonlinear, and
caustic proton image features for the selected geometries, and is shown to be
fairly robust to noise in the input proton intensity.

neutral hydrogen gas outflows in these galaxies. To investigate the potential
drivers of such outflows we select a sample of 802 LERGs using the Best &
Heckman (2012) catalogue of radio galaxies. By modelling the [O III] $\lambda
5007$ profile in Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra of a sample of 802 LERGs, we
determine that the ionized outflows are present in $\sim 1.5\%$ of the
population. Using $1.4~\text{GHz}$ imaging from the Faint Images of the Radio
Sky at Twenty Centimeters survey we analyze the radio morphology of LERGs with
outflows and find these to be consistent with the parent LERG population.
However, we note that unlike the majority of the LERG population, those LERGs
showing outflows have Eddington scaled accretion rates close to $1\%$. This is
indicative that ionized outflows in LERGs are driven by the radiation pressure
from the accretion disk of the AGN rather than the radio jets. We report
specific star formation rates in the range of $10^{-12} < \text{sSFR} <
10^{-9}~\text{yr}^{-1}$. Moreover, we observe higher mass outflow rates of
$7-150~M_{\odot}~\text{yr}^{-1}$ for these LERGs than luminous quasars for a
given bolometric luminosity, which could possibly be due to the radio source in
LERGs boosting the mass-loading. This scenario could indicate that these
outflows could potentially drive feedback in LERGs.

generation. During pre-training, the model learns to apply the given code
change in a correct way. This task requires only code changes themselves, which
makes it unsupervised. In the task of applying code changes, our model
outperforms baseline models by 5.9 percentage points in accuracy. As for the

supervised models trained for this specific task, which indicates that it can

interplay of interlayer interactions and superlattice structure impacts
electron transport in a variety of non-trivial ways and gives rise to a
plethora of interesting effects. Understanding the mechanisms of electron
scattering in TBG has, however, proven challenging, raising many questions
about the origins of resistivity in this system. Here we show that TBG exhibits
high-temperature magnetooscillations originating from the scattering of charge
carriers between TBG minivalleys. The amplitude of these oscillations reveals
that interminivalley scattering is strong, and its characteristic time scale is
comparable to that of its intraminivalley counterpart. Furthermore, by
exploring the temperature dependence of these oscillations, we estimate the
electron-electron collision rate in TBG and find that it exceeds that of
monolayer graphene. Our study demonstrates the consequences of the relatively
small size of the superlattice Brillouin zone and Fermi velocity reduction on
lateral transport in TBG.

release, are located at a distance of about 2.9 kpc. By analyzing the
interstellar medium (ISM) at infrared, centimeter, and millimeter wavelengths
towards this group of clusters we discovered a shell of material of about 2
degree in size at the same distance. We suggest that the shell, mainly observed
at 12 um and in the Hi emission at 21 cm, was generated by the action of
massive stars belonging to clusters Berkeley 7 and UBC 414, that lie at its
center. Five clusters (MWSC0152, Czernik 6, Czernik 7, Berkeley 6, NGC 663, and
NGC 654) lie at the border of this shell. From the comparison between the
dynamical time of the discovered Hi shell and the analysis of the ages of
stellar populations in these clusters, we conclude that the expansion of the
shell could have triggered in the past the formation of stars in some of them.
We point out that in order to find physical evidence supporting a genetic
connection between stellar clusters, it is necessary not only to study the
individual clusters and their stellar populations, but also to investigate

using high-speed imaging of a charged drop levitated in an AC quadrupole trap
is shown to undergo asymmetric breakup by ejecting a jet in the upward
direction ((i.e., opposite to the direction of gravity)). To explain this
typical experimental observation, we carry out numerical calculations based on
the boundary element method considering inertial droplets levitated
electrodynamically using quadrupole electric fields. The simulations show that
the gravity-induced downward shift in the equilibrium position of the drop in
the trap causes significant, large-amplitude shape oscillations superimposed
over the center-of-mass oscillations of the drop. An important observation here
is that the shape oscillations due to the applied quadrupole fields, result in
sufficient deformations that act as triggers for the onset of the instability
below the Rayleigh limit, thereby admitting a sub-critical instability. The
center-of-mass oscillations of the droplet within the trap, which follow the
applied frequency, are out of phase with the applied AC signal. Thus the
combined effect of shape deformations and dynamic position of the drop leads to
an asymmetric breakup such that the Rayleigh fission occurs upwards via the
ejection of a jet at the north-pole of the deformed drop.

Deciding when to stop training can have a substantial impact on the performance
of the network during inference. Under certain conditions, the generalization
error can display a double descent pattern during training: the learning curve
is non-monotonic and seemingly diverges before converging again after
additional epochs. This optimization pattern can lead to early stopping
procedures to stop training before the second convergence and consequently
select a suboptimal set of parameters for the network, with worse performance
during inference. In this work, in addition to confirming that double descent
occurs with small datasets and noisy labels as evidenced by others, we show
that noisy labels must be present both in the training and generalization sets
to observe a double descent pattern. We also show that the learning rate has an
influence on double descent, and study how different optimizers and optimizer
parameters influence the apparition of double descent. Finally, we show that
increasing the learning rate can create an aliasing effect that masks the
double descent pattern without suppressing it. We study this phenomenon through
extensive experiments on variants of CIFAR-10 and show that they translate to a
real world application: the forecast of seizure events in epileptic patients
from continuous electroencephalographic recordings.

two $\thicksim$ 40m mirrors, a feedhorn array of 28 horns, and no moving parts,
working as a drift-scan instrument. It will cover a $15^{\circ}$ declination

linear regression equation (LRE) is considered. Such parameters change their
values over the interval of the regressor finite (rather than persistent)
excitation. To solve it, the previously proposed I-DREM procedure and the
integral-based filtering method with the exponential forgetting and resetting
are improved: the integral of the filter equations is taken over the finite
time intervals, which belong to the finite excitation time range. This allows
one to obtain an exponentially bounded identification error over the excitation
interval, and, when the LRE parameters are constant outside such interval, to
provide exponential convergence of the identification error to zero. In
addition, the applied method of the regressor excitation normalization makes it
possible to obtain the same rate of convergence of the parameter error for the
regressors of various amplitudes. The stability and all the above-mentioned
properties are proved for the derived identification method. The results of
numerical experiments (including the case of the noise-contaminated regressor
and output measurements) fully support the obtained theoretical results.

We augment this synchronization setting with a model of side information
preserving the sign symmetry of $\theta$, and propose an \emph{efficient}
algorithm which synchronizes a randomly chosen pair of far away vertices on
average, up to a differently defined critical threshold $p_c(d)$. We conjecture
that $ p_c(d)=\tilde{p}_c(d)$ for all $d \ge 2$. Our strategy is to
\emph{renormalize} the synchronization model in order to reduce the effective

items to be stacked are steel bars or steel plates in a steel yard or
containers in a container terminal or on a ship. We say that two items are
conflicting if their storage time intervals overlap in which case one of the
items needs to be rehandled if the items are stored at the same LIFO storage
location. We consider the problem of stacking items using $k$ LIFO locations
with a minimum number of conflicts between items sharing a location. We present
an extremely simple online stacking algorithm that is oblivious to the storage
time intervals and storage locations of all other items when it picks a storage
location for an item. The risk of assigning the same storage location to two
conflicting items is proved to be of the order $1/k^2$ under mild assumptions
on the distribution of the storage time intervals for the items. Intuitively,
it seems natural to pick a storage location uniformly at random in the
oblivious setting implying a risk of $1/k$ so the risk for our algorithm is
surprisingly low. Our results can also be expressed within the context of the

  We prove that the Grundy value (a.k.a. nim-value, or nimber) of Undirected
Geography is PSPACE-complete to compute. This exhibits a stark contrast with a
result from 1993 that Undirected Geography is polynomial-time solvable. By
distilling to a simple reduction, our proof further establishes a dichotomy
theorem, providing a ""phase transition to intractability"" in Grundy-value
computation, sharply characterized by a maximum degree of four: The Grundy
value of Undirected Geography over any degree-three graph is polynomial-time
computable, but over degree-four graphs-even when planar and bipartite-is
PSPACE-hard. Additionally, we show, for the first time, how to construct
Undirected Geography instances with Grundy value $\ast n$ and size polynomial
in n.
  We strengthen a result from 1981 showing that sums of tractable partisan
games are PSPACE-complete in two fundamental ways. First, since Undirected
Geography is an impartial ruleset, we extend the hardness of sums to impartial
games, a strict subset of partisan. Second, the 1981 construction is not built
from a natural ruleset, instead using a long sum of tailored short-depth game
positions. We use the sum of two Undirected Geography positions to create our
hard instances. Our result also has computational implications to
Sprague-Grundy Theory (1930s) which shows that the Grundy value of the
disjunctive sum of any two impartial games can be computed-in polynomial
time-from their Grundy values. In contrast, we prove that assuming PSPACE
$\neq$ P, there is no general polynomial-time method to summarize two
polynomial-time solvable impartial games to efficiently solve their disjunctive

search for topological SU($N$)$_1$ CSL in some range of the Hamiltonian
parameters via a combination of complementary numerical methods such as exact

in a manner similar to its SU($2$) and SU($3$) analogs, is shown to give a good
variational ansatz of the $N=4$ ground state, with chiral edge modes
originating from the PEPS holographic bulk-edge correspondence. Finally, we
discuss the possible observation of such Abelian CSL in ultracold atom setups
where the possibility of varying $N$ provides a tuning parameter similar to the
magnetic field in the physics of the FQH effect.

electric traction systems and various industrial processes. However, prolonged
exposure to high temperatures while operating can demagnetize the permanent

measurements with infrared sensors or contact-type sensors with wireless
communication can be expensive and intrusive to the motor drive systems. This
paper thus proposes a nonintrusive thermal monitoring scheme for the permanent
magnets inside the direct-torque-controlled interior permanent magnet
synchronous machines. By applying an external high-frequency rotating flux or
torque signal to the hysteresis torque controller in the motor drive, the
high-frequency currents can be injected into the stator windings. The permanent
magnet temperature can thus be monitored based on the induced high-frequency
resistance. The nonintrusive nature of the method is indicated by the
elimination of the extra sensors and no hardware change to the existing system.
Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated with

are characterized by a flat dispersion and a diverging plasmonic density of

All Pairs Shortest Paths, which can be solved in $\tilde{O}(mn)$ time. So it is

  Abboud, Vassilevska W., and Wang [SODA 2016] first studied min-distance

a $3$-approximation algorithm for min-radius on DAGs which works in
$\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n})$ time, and showing that any $(2-\delta)$-approximation
requires $n^{2-o(1)}$ time for any $\delta>0$, under the Hitting Set

runs in $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n})$ time. As the lower bound of Abboud et al only
works for sparse DAGs, we further show that our algorithm is conditionally
tight for dense DAGs using a reduction from Boolean matrix multiplication.
Moreover, Abboud et al obtained a linear time $2$-approximation algorithm for
min-diameter along with a lower bound stating that any
$(3/2-\delta)$-approximation algorithm for sparse DAGs requires $n^{2-o(1)}$

lacks linear properties even under the assumption of small displacements. The
most common is the cubic nonlinearity that may stem from either geometric or
material properties. Examples include flexible structural components,
pre-tensioned cables, springs, and polymers. When subjected to tight rigid
constraints collisions might take place, leading to an additional infinitely
strong nonlinearity. The resulting dynamical regime involves both smooth
nonlinear oscillations (SNOs) and a hybrid cubic vibro-impact (HCVI) regime.
The adaptive nonlinearity of the HCVI oscillator is used by the HCVI-nonlinear
energy sink (NES) as an effective mechanism for efficient vibration mitigation
in broad energy and frequency ranges. Due to the multiple essential
nonlinearities of the HCVI oscillator, traditional analytical methods are
inapplicable for the description of its transient dynamics. In the current
work, we model the HCVI oscillator by a forced particle in a hybrid
quartic-square potential well with infinite depth under periodic external
forcing. Unlike previous studies, three underlying dynamical mechanisms that
govern the occurrence of bifurcations are identified: two maximum mechanisms
and one saddle mechanism. The maximal transient energy is predicted
analytically over the space of excitation parameters and described using
iso-energy contours. The response curves of the system are obtained
analytically, allowing a full perspective on the HCVI-oscillator dynamical
response, and the HCVI-NES performances and design optimization. All
theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations.

cross-lingual transfer, performing best for languages seen during pretraining.
While methods exist to improve performance for unseen languages, they have
almost exclusively been evaluated using amounts of raw text only available for
a small fraction of the world's languages. In this paper, we evaluate the
performance of existing methods to adapt PMMs to new languages using a resource
available for over 1600 languages: the New Testament. This is challenging for
two reasons: (1) the small corpus size, and (2) the narrow domain. While
performance drops for all approaches, we surprisingly still see gains of up to
$17.69\%$ accuracy for part-of-speech tagging and $6.29$ F1 for NER on average
over all languages as compared to XLM-R. Another unexpected finding is that
continued pretraining, the simplest approach, performs best. Finally, we
perform a case study to disentangle the effects of domain and size and to shed
light on the influence of the finetuning source language.

problem when using deep neural networks and other discriminative models.
Perceptual aliasing will arise wherever a physical variable extracted from
tactile data is subject to ambiguity between stimuli that are physically
distinct. Here we address this problem using a probabilistic discriminative
model implemented as a 5-component mixture density network comprised of a deep
neural network that predicts the parameters of a Gaussian mixture model. We
show that discriminative regression models such as deep neural networks and
Gaussian process regression perform poorly on aliased data, only making
accurate predictions when the sources of aliasing are removed. In contrast, the
mixture density network identifies aliased data with improved prediction
accuracy. The uncertain predictions of the model form patterns that are
consistent with the various sources of perceptual ambiguity. In our view,
perceptual aliasing will become an unavoidable issue for robot touch as the
field progresses to training robots that act in uncertain and unstructured
environments, such as with deep reinforcement learning.

multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is the difference between mean rewards in the
top two arms, also known as the instance gap. The celebrated Upper Confidence
Bound (UCB) policy is among the simplest optimism-based MAB algorithms that
naturally adapts to this gap: for a horizon of play n, it achieves optimal
O(log n) regret in instances with ""large"" gaps, and a near-optimal O(\sqrt{n
log n}) minimax regret when the gap can be arbitrarily ""small."" This paper
provides new results on the arm-sampling behavior of UCB, leading to several
important insights. Among these, it is shown that arm-sampling rates under UCB
are asymptotically deterministic, regardless of the problem complexity. This
discovery facilitates new sharp asymptotics and a novel alternative proof for
the O(\sqrt{n log n}) minimax regret of UCB. Furthermore, the paper also
provides the first complete process-level characterization of the MAB problem
under UCB in the conventional diffusion scaling. Among other things, the
""small"" gap worst-case lens adopted in this paper also reveals profound
distinctions between the behavior of UCB and Thompson Sampling, such as an
""incomplete learning"" phenomenon characteristic of the latter.

data; for example, with the emergence of new sampling techniques in ecology. In
smaller dimensions, multivariate probit (MVP) models are routinely used for
inferences. However, algorithms for fitting such models face issues in scaling
up to high dimensions due to the intractability of the likelihood, involving an
integral over a multivariate normal distribution having no analytic form.
Although a variety of algorithms have been proposed to approximate this
intractable integral, these approaches are difficult to implement and/or
inaccurate in high dimensions. Our main focus is in accommodating
high-dimensional binary response data with a small to moderate number of
covariates. We propose a two-stage approach for inference on model parameters
while taking care of uncertainty propagation between the stages. We use the
special structure of latent Gaussian models to reduce the highly expensive
computation involved in joint parameter estimation to focus inference on
marginal distributions of model parameters. This essentially makes the method
embarrassingly parallel for both stages. We illustrate performance in
simulations and applications to joint species distribution modeling in ecology.

uniaxial and multiaxial random loadings is proposed in this paper. One unique
characteristic of the proposed method is that it uses time-derivative damage
accumulation model compared to the classical cycle-based damage accumulation
model. Thus, damage under arbitrary random loading can be directly obtained
using time-domain integration without cycle counting (e.g., rain-flow cycle
counting method in classical fatigue analysis). First, a brief review of
existing models is given focusing on their applicability to
uniaxial/multiaxial, constant/random, and high cycle fatigue/low cycle fatigue
loading regimes. It is observed that most existing models are only applicable
to certain loading conditions and many of them are not applicable/validated
under random loadings. Next, a time-derivative damage accumulation model under
uniaxial random loading is proposed. The proposed damage function is inspired
by a time-domain fatigue crack growth model. The fatigue life is obtained by
integrating the damage function following random energy loading histories.
Following this, an equivalent energy concept for general multiaxial loading
conditions is used to convert the random multiaxial loading to an equivalent
random uniaxial loading, where the time-derivative damage model can be used.
Finally, the proposed model is validated with extensive experimental data from
open literature and in-house testing data under various constant and random
spectrum loadings. Conclusions and future work are suggested based on the
findings from this study.

the miscalibration of trust in automation is a common issue that jeopardizes
the effectiveness of automation use. It happens when a user's trust levels are
not appropriate to the capabilities of the automation being used. Users can be:
under-trusting the automation -- when they do not use the functionalities that
the machine can perform correctly because of a lack of trust; or over-trusting
the automation -- when, due to an excess of trust, they use the machine in
situations where its capabilities are not adequate. The main objective of this
work is to examine driver's trust development in the ADS. We aim to model how
risk factors (e.g.: false alarms and misses from the ADS) and the short-term
interactions associated with these risk factors influence the dynamics of
drivers' trust in the ADS. The driving context facilitates the instrumentation
to measure trusting behaviors, such as drivers' eye movements and usage time of
the automated features. Our findings indicate that a reliable characterization
of drivers' trusting behaviors and a consequent estimation of trust levels is
possible. We expect that these techniques will permit the design of ADSs able
to adapt their behaviors to attempt to adjust driver's trust levels. This
capability could avoid under- and over-trusting, which could harm their safety

$\mathcal{X}\subseteq\mathcal{T}\subseteq\mathcal{S}$, where $\mathcal{X}$ is
functorially finite and $\mathcal{T}$ is $2d$-cluster tilting, satisfying some
mild conditions. We show there is an isomorphism between the Grothendieck group
$K_{0}(\mathcal{S},\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{X}},\mathfrak{s}_{\mathcal{X}})$ of the
category $\mathcal{S}$, equipped with the $d$-exangulated structure induced by
$\mathcal{X}$, and the quotient $K_{0}^{sp}(\mathcal{T})/N$, where $N$ is the
higher analogue of $M$ above. When $\mathcal{X}=\mathcal{T}$ the isomorphism is
induced by the higher index with respect to $\mathcal{T}$ introduced recently
by J{\o}rgensen. Thus, in the general case, we can understand the map taking an
object in $\mathcal{S}$ to its $K_{0}$-class in
$K_{0}(\mathcal{S},\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{X}},\mathfrak{s}_{\mathcal{X}})$ as a
higher index with respect to the rigid subcategory $\mathcal{X}$.

discontinuous shock waves from smooth initial data. We prove that from smooth
initial data, smooth solutions to the 2d Euler equations in azimuthal symmetry
form a first singularity, the so-called $C^{\frac{1}{3}} $ pre-shock. The
solution in the vicinity of this pre-shock is shown to have a fractional series
expansion with coefficients computed from the data. Using this precise
description of the pre-shock, we prove that a discontinuous shock
instantaneously develops after the pre-shock. This regular shock solution is
shown to be unique in a class of entropy solutions with azimuthal symmetry and
regularity determined by the pre-shock expansion. Simultaneous to the
development of the shock front, two other characteristic surfaces of cusp-type
singularities emerge from the pre-shock. These surfaces have been termed weak
discontinuities by Landau & Lifschitz [Chapter IX, \S 96], who conjectured some
type of singular behavior of derivatives along such surfaces. We prove that
along the slowest surface, all fluid variables except the entropy have $C^{1,
{\frac{1}{2}} }$ one-sided cusps from the shock side, and that the normal
velocity is decreasing in the direction of its motion; we thus term this
surface a weak rarefaction wave. Along the surface moving with the fluid
velocity, density and entropy form $C^{1, {\frac{1}{2}} }$ one-sided cusps
while the pressure and normal velocity remain $C^2$; as such, we term this
surface a weak contact discontinuity.

limited by the system size. In this work, we apply and expand the stochastic GW
method allowing calculations of quasiparticle energies of giant systems. We
introduce three new developments to the stochastic many-body formalism:
efficient evaluation of off-diagonal self-energy terms, construction of Dyson
orbitals, and introduce stochastic cRPA, enabling efficient downfolding onto
model Hamiltonians. We exemplify the new methodology by exploring twisted
bilayer graphene (tBLG); its moire periodicity is associated with giant
unit-cells hosting correlated electrons in flat bands. The resulting behavior
of tBLG is governed by the coupling between the weakly and strongly correlated
electrons in individual monolayers, controlled by twist or applied pressure.
Here we study the latter scenario. The calculations document the formation of
charge carrier localization at the Fermi level while most weakly correlated
states are merely shifted in energy. This contrasts with the mean-field
results. We show how to efficiently downfold the correlated subspace on a model
Hamiltonian, namely the Hubbard model with a screened frequency dependent
on-site interaction, computed with newly developed stochastic cRPA. For the
$6^{\circ}$ tBLG system, the onsite interactions range between 200 and 300 meV
under compression. The Dyson orbitals exhibit spatial distribution similar to
the mean-field single particle states. Under pressure, the electron-electron
interactions in the localized states increase; the dynamical screening does not
fully compensate the dominant bare Coulomb interaction. The correlated moir\'e
states thus appear only moderately screened at high pressures suggesting the
presence of insulating states in compressed tBLG.

concept of ""Everything-as-a-Service"" and enabled through mobile internet
technologies. In the context of economic deregulation, a MaaS system consists
of a typical two-sided market, where travelers and transportation service
providers (TSPs) are two groups of agents interacting with each other through a
MaaS platform. In this study, we propose a modeling and optimization framework
for the regulation of two-sided MaaS markets. We consider a name-your-own-price
(NYOP)-auction mechanism where travelers submit purchase-bids to accommodate
their travel demand via MaaS platform, and TSPs submit sell-bids to supply
mobility resources for the MaaS platform in exchange for payments. We cast this
problem as a single-leader multi-follower game (SLMFG) where the leader is the
MaaS regulator and two groups of follower problems represent the travelers and
the TSPs. The MaaS regulator aims to maximize its profits by optimizing
operations. In response to the MaaS regulator's decisions, travelers (resp.
TSPs) adjust their participation level in the MaaS platform to minimize their
travel costs (resp. maximize their profits). We analyze cross-group network
effects in the MaaS market, and formulate SLMFGs without and with network
effects leading to mixed-integer linear bilevel programming and mixed-integer
quadratic bilevel programming problems, respectively. We propose customized
branch-and-bound algorithms based on strong duality reformulations to solve
these SLMFGs. Extensive numerical experiments conducted on large scale
simulation instances generated from realistic mobility data highlight that the
performance of the proposed algorithms is significantly superior to a
benchmarking approach, and provide meaningful managerial insights for the
regulation of two-sided MaaS markets in practice.

Bose gas with repulsive pairwise atomic interactions at zero temperature. Our
goal is to describe aspects of the excited many-body quantum states by
accounting for the scattering of atoms in pairs from the macroscopic state
(condensate). We formally construct a many-body Hamiltonian,
$\mathcal{H}_{\text{app}}$, that is quadratic in the Boson field operators for
noncondensate atoms. This $\mathcal{H}_{\text{app}}$ conserves the total number
of atoms. Inspired by Wu (J. Math. Phys., 2:105-123, 1961), we apply a
non-unitary transformation to $\mathcal{H}_{\text{app}}$. Key in this
non-Hermitian view is the pair-excitation kernel, which in operator form obeys
a Riccati equation. In the stationary case, we develop an existence theory for
solutions to this operator equation by a variational approach. We connect this
theory to the one-particle excitation wave functions heuristically derived by
Fetter (Ann. Phys., 70:67-101, 1972). These functions solve an eigenvalue
problem for a $J$-self-adjoint operator. From the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, we
derive a one-particle nonlocal equation for low-lying excitations, describe its
solutions, and recover Fetter's excitation spectrum. Our approach leads to a
description of the excited eigenstates of the reduced Hamiltonian in the
$N$-particle sector of Fock space.

observations and analysis. We find that the horizon cannot be ignored when
modeling low frequency observations. Even if the sky and antenna beam are known
exactly, forward models cannot fully describe the beam-weighted foreground
component without accurate knowledge of the horizon. When fitting data to
extract the 21-cm signal, a single time-averaged spectrum or independent
multi-spectrum fits may be able to compensate for the bias imposed by the
horizon. However, these types of fits lack constraining power on the 21-cm
signal, leading to large uncertainties on the signal extraction, in some cases
larger in magnitude than the 21-cm signal itself. A significant decrease in
signal uncertainty can be achieved by performing multi-spectrum fits in which
the spectra are modeled simultaneously with common parameters. The cost of this
greatly increased constraining power, however, is that the time dependence of
the horizon's effect, which is more complex than its spectral dependence, must
be precisely modeled to achieve a good fit. To aid in modeling the horizon, we
present an algorithm and Python package for calculating the horizon profile
from a given observation site using elevation data. We also address several
practical concerns such as pixelization error, uncertainty in the horizon
profile, and foreground obstructions such as surrounding buildings and
vegetation. We demonstrate that our training set-based analysis pipeline can
account for all of these factors to model the horizon well enough to precisely
extract the 21-cm signal from simulated observations.

is becoming increasingly important. To stay fresh, applications stream status
updates among their components. Existing studies propose the metric age of
information (AoI) to gauge the freshness and design systems to achieve low AoI.
Despite active research in this area, existing results are not applicable to
general wired networks for two reasons. First, they focus on wireless settings
where AoI is mostly affected by interference and collision while queueing is
more dominant in wired settings. Second, the legacy drop-adverse flows are not
taken into account in the literature. Scheduling mixed flows with distinct
performance objective is not yet addressed.
  In this paper, we study wired networks shared by two classes of flows, aiming
for high throughput and low AoI respectively, and achieve a good trade-off
between their throughput and AoI. Our approach to the problem consists of two
layers: freshness-aware traffic engineering (FATE) and in-network freshness
control (IFC). FATE derives sending rate/update frequency for flows via
optimization, and its solution is then enforced by IFC through efficient
scheduling mechanisms at each outport of in-network nodes. We also present
efficient Linux implementation of IFC and demonstrate the effectiveness of
FATE/IFC through extensive emulations. Our results show that it is possible to
trade a little throughput (5 % lower) for much shorter AoI (49 to 71% shorter)

that LLL and certain 1-d sandpile models with simpler toppling rules belong to

idea that there must exist a meaningful connection between the two. Indeed, on
those sandpile models, we are able to prove the analogues of some of the most
desired statements for LLL, such as the existence of the gap between the
theoretical and the experimental RHF bounds. Furthermore, we test the formulas
from the finite-size scaling theory (FSS) against the LLL algorithm itself, and
find that they are in excellent agreement. This in particular explains and
refines the geometric series assumption (GSA), and allows one to extrapolate
various quantities of interest to the dimension limit. In particular, we

mysteries? The history of this theory is replete with dubious interpretations
and controversies, and yet a knowledge of its predictions, however, contributed
to the amazing technological revolution of the last hundred years. In its very
beginning Einstein pointed out that there was something missing, due to
contradictions with the relativity theory. So, even though Quantum Mechanics
explains all the nanoscale physical phenomena, there were many attempts to find
a way to ""complete"" it, e.g. hidden-variable theories. In this paper, we
discuss some of those enigmas, with special attention to the concepts of
physical reality imposed by quantum mechanics, the role of the observer,
prediction limits, a definition of collapse, and how to deal with correlated
states (the basic strategy for quantum computers and quantum teleportation).
That discussion is carried out within the framework of accepting that there is
in fact nothing important missing, rather we are just restricted by the
limitations imposed by quantum mechanics. The mysteries are thus explained by a

constraint of approximate differential privacy. We prove that
$\widetilde{O}(k^2 d \log^{3/2}(1/\delta) / \alpha^2 \varepsilon)$ samples are
sufficient to learn a mixture of $k$ axis-aligned Gaussians in $\mathbb{R}^d$
to within total variation distance $\alpha$ while satisfying $(\varepsilon,
\delta)$-differential privacy. This is the first result for privately learning
mixtures of unbounded axis-aligned (or even unbounded univariate) Gaussians. If
the covariance matrices of each of the Gaussians is the identity matrix, we
show that $\widetilde{O}(kd/\alpha^2 + kd \log(1/\delta) / \alpha \varepsilon)$
samples are sufficient.
  Recently, the ""local covering"" technique of Bun, Kamath, Steinke, and Wu has
been successfully used for privately learning high-dimensional Gaussians with a
known covariance matrix and extended to privately learning general
high-dimensional Gaussians by Aden-Ali, Ashtiani, and Kamath. Given these
positive results, this approach has been proposed as a promising direction for
privately learning mixtures of Gaussians. Unfortunately, we show that this is
not possible.
  We design a new technique for privately learning mixture distributions. A
class of distributions $\mathcal{F}$ is said to be list-decodable if there is
an algorithm that, given ""heavily corrupted"" samples from $f\in \mathcal{F}$,
outputs a list of distributions, $\widehat{\mathcal{F}}$, such that one of the
distributions in $\widehat{\mathcal{F}}$ approximates $f$. We show that if
$\mathcal{F}$ is privately list-decodable, then we can privately learn mixtures
of distributions in $\mathcal{F}$. Finally, we show axis-aligned Gaussian
distributions are privately list-decodable, thereby proving mixtures of such
distributions are privately learnable.

changes in the GFW's behavior. In this study, we introduce GFWatch, a
large-scale, longitudinal measurement platform capable of testing hundreds of
millions of domains daily, enabling continuous monitoring of the GFW's DNS
filtering behavior.
  We present the results of running GFWatch over a nine-month period, during
which we tested an average of 411M domains per day and detected a total of 311K
domains censored by GFW's DNS filter. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
largest number of domains tested and censored domains discovered in the

find 41K innocuous domains that match these filters, resulting in overblocking
of their content. We also observe bogus IPv6 and globally routable IPv4
addresses injected by the GFW, including addresses owned by US companies, such

propose strategies to detect poisoned responses that can (1) sanitize poisoned

at the audio signal's frame-level structure. We overcome this limitation with a
segmental contrastive predictive coding (SCPC) framework that can model the
signal structure at a higher level e.g. at the phoneme level. In this
framework, a convolutional neural network learns frame-level representation
from the raw waveform via noise-contrastive estimation (NCE). A differentiable
boundary detector finds variable-length segments, which are then used to
optimize a segment encoder via NCE to learn segment representations. The
differentiable boundary detector allows us to train frame-level and
segment-level encoders jointly. Typically, phoneme and word segmentation are
treated as separate tasks. We unify them and experimentally show that our
single model outperforms existing phoneme and word segmentation methods on
TIMIT and Buckeye datasets. We analyze the impact of boundary threshold and

work introduced ranged symbolic execution to distribute the symbolic execution

inputs. However, each worker was restricted to perform only a depth-first
search. This paper introduces a new approach to ranging, called test-depth
partitioning, that allows the workers to employ different search strategies
without compromising the completeness of the overall search. Experimental
results show that the proposed approach provides a more flexible ranging
solution for distributed symbolic execution. The core idea behind test-depth
partitioning is to use a test-depth pair to define a region in the execution
space. Such a pair represents a partial path or a prefix, and it obviates the
need for complete tests to determine boundaries as was the case in the previous
ranging scheme. Moreover, different workers have the freedom to select the
search strategy of choice without affecting the functioning of the overall
system. Test-depth partitioning is implemented using KLEE, a well-known

fields in dense matter. With the strong magnetic fields and large neutrino
magnetic moments, Majorana neutrinos can reach flavor equilibrium. We find that
the flavor equilibration of neutrino-antineutrino oscillations is sensitive to
the values of the baryon density and the electron fraction inside the matter.
The neutrino-antineutrino oscillations are suppressed in the case of the large
baryon density in neutron (proton)-rich matter. On the other hand, the flavor
equilibration occurs when the electron fraction is close to $0.5$ even in the
large baryon density. From the simulations, we propose a necessary condition
for the equilibration of neutrino-antineutrino oscillations in dense matter. We
also study whether such necessary condition is satisfied near the proto-neutron
star by using results of neutrino hydrodynamic simulations of core-collapse
supernovae. In our explosion model, the flavor equilibration would be possible
if the magnetic field on the surface of the proto-neutron star is larger than
$10^{14}$ G which is the typical value of the magnetic fields of magnetars.

corresponding question is generated by retrieving and then analyzing a fixed

considered only retrieving information from ordered utterances. However, the
sequential order of dialogue is important to build a robust spoken
conversational question answering system, and the changes of utterances order
may severely result in low-quality and incoherent corpora. To this end, we
introduce a self-supervised learning approach, including incoherence
discrimination, insertion detection, and question prediction, to explicitly
capture the coreference resolution and dialogue coherence among spoken
documents. Specifically, we design a joint learning framework where the
auxiliary self-supervised tasks can enable the pre-trained SCQA systems towards
more coherent and meaningful spoken dialogue learning. We also utilize the
proposed self-supervised learning tasks to capture intra-sentence coherence.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method provides more
coherent, meaningful, and appropriate responses, yielding superior performance
gains compared to the original pre-trained language models. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on the Spoken-CoQA dataset.

the learned associations between gender and language to toxic language

responding to external stimuli. Biological processes use different strategies
to store memory. In the olfactory cortex, synaptic connections form when
stimulated by an odor, and establish distributed memory that can be retrieved
upon re-exposure. In contrast, the immune system encodes specialized memory by
diverse receptors that recognize a multitude of evolving pathogens. Despite the
mechanistic differences between the olfactory and the immune memory, these
systems can still be viewed as different information encoding strategies. Here,
we present a theoretical framework with artificial neural networks to
characterize optimal memory strategies for both static and dynamic (evolving)
patterns. Our approach is a generalization of the energy-based Hopfield model
in which memory is stored as a network's energy minima. We find that while
classical Hopfield networks with distributed memory can efficiently encode a
memory of static patterns, they are inadequate against evolving patterns. To
follow an evolving pattern, we show that a distributed network should use a
higher learning rate, which in turn, can distort the energy landscape
associated with the stored memory attractors. Specifically, narrow connecting
paths emerge between memory attractors, leading to misclassification of
evolving patterns. We demonstrate that compartmentalized networks with
specialized subnetworks are the optimal solutions to memory storage for
evolving patterns. We postulate that evolution of pathogens may be the reason
for the immune system to encoded a focused memory, in contrast to the
distributed memory used in the olfactory cortex that interacts with mixtures of
static odors.

Angle-resolved spectroscopic techniques are commonly used for characterizing

limited sensitivity of infrared detectors. Here, we propose an alternative
approach to measuring infrared dispersion relations. We construct a
high-precision angle-resolved setup compatible with a Fourier-transform

reflection spectra are mapped to the 2D photonic band structures of
In(Ga,Al)As/InP based PC slabs, which are designed as mid-infrared PC
surface-emitting lasers. We identify complex PC modes with the aid of
polarization selection rules derived by the group theory. Spectral analysis
makes it possible to evaluate the mode quality (Q) factors. Therefore,
angle-resolved reflection is a useful way of optimizing 2D PC parameters for

major difficulty for deep RL approaches -- is the ability to generalize

similar tasks not seen during training. Many promising approaches to this
challenge consider RL as a process of training two functions simultaneously: a
complex nonlinear encoder that maps high-dimensional observations to a latent
representation space, and a simple linear policy over this space. We posit that
a superior encoder for zero-shot generalization in RL can be trained by using
solely an auxiliary SSL objective if the training process encourages the
encoder to map behaviorally similar observations to similar representations, as
reward-based signal can cause overfitting in the encoder (Raileanu et al.,
2021). We propose Cross-Trajectory Representation Learning (CTRL), a method
that runs within an RL agent and conditions its encoder to recognize behavioral
similarity in observations by applying a novel SSL objective to pairs of
trajectories from the agent's policies. CTRL can be viewed as having the same
effect as inducing a pseudo-bisimulation metric but, crucially, avoids the use
of rewards and associated overfitting risks. Our experiments ablate various
components of CTRL and demonstrate that in combination with PPO it achieves
better generalization performance on the challenging Procgen benchmark suite

(ML) algorithms to be used on sensitive data. We contribute to this line of
research by proposing a framework that allows efficient and secure evaluation
of full-fledged state-of-the-art ML algorithms via secure multi-party
computation (MPC). This is in contrast to most prior works, which substitute ML
algorithms with approximated ""MPC-friendly"" variants. A drawback of the latter
approach is that fine-tuning of the combined ML and MPC algorithms is required,
which might lead to less efficient algorithms or inferior quality ML. This is
an issue for secure deep neural networks (DNN) training in particular, as this
involves arithmetic algorithms thought to be ""MPC-unfriendly"", namely, integer
division, exponentiation, inversion, and square root. In this work, we propose
secure and efficient protocols for the above seemingly MPC-unfriendly
computations. Our protocols are three-party protocols in the honest-majority
setting, and we propose both passively secure and actively secure with abort
variants. A notable feature of our protocols is that they simultaneously
provide high accuracy and efficiency. This framework enables us to efficiently
and securely compute modern ML algorithms such as Adam and the softmax function
""as is"", without resorting to approximations. As a result, we obtain secure DNN
training that outperforms state-of-the-art three-party systems; our full
training is up to 6.7 times faster than just the online phase of the recently
proposed FALCON@PETS'21 on a standard benchmark network. We further perform
measurements on real-world DNNs, AlexNet and VGG16. The performance of our
framework is up to a factor of about 12-14 faster for AlexNet and 46-48 faster
for VGG16 to achieve an accuracy of 70% and 75%, respectively, when compared to

preservation problem that they usually ignore part of the source sentence and

Non-Autoregressive generator for unsupervised text Style Transfer (NAST), which
alleviates the problem from two aspects. First, we observe that most words in
the transferred sentence can be aligned with related words in the source
sentence, so we explicitly model word alignments to suppress irrelevant words.
Second, existing models trained with the cycle loss align sentences in two
stylistic text spaces, which lacks fine-grained control at the word level. The
proposed non-autoregressive generator focuses on the connections between
aligned words, which learns the word-level transfer between styles. For
experiments, we integrate the proposed generator into two base models and
evaluate them on two style transfer tasks. The results show that NAST can
significantly improve the overall performance and provide explainable word
alignments. Moreover, the non-autoregressive generator achieves over 10x
speedups at inference. Our codes are available at

biquadratic exchange interactions in monolayer NiX2 (X=Cl, Br and I), by
combining first-principles calculations and the newly developed machine

ferromagnetic ground state within NiCl2 single layers cannot be explained by
means of bilinear Heisenberg Hamiltonian; rather, the nearest-neighbor
biquadratic interaction is found to be crucial. Furthermore, using a
three-orbitals Hubbard model, we propose that the giant biquadratic exchange

orbitals on neighboring magnetic ions. On a general framework, our work
suggests biquadratic exchange interactions to be important in 2D magnets with

triggered the high-mass star formation in the two regions. The collision in W3
Main involves a small cloud of $\sim$5 pc in diameter which collided with a
large cloud of 10 pc $\times$ 20 pc. The collision in W3 Main compressed the

spontaneously breaks the discrete time-translational symmetry in a
periodically-driven quantum system. Here, we study DTCs in a Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC) bouncing resonantly on an oscillating mirror, using a two-mode
model derived from a standard quantum field theory. We investigate the validity
of this model and apply it to study the long-time behavior of our system. A
wide variety of initial states based on two Wannier modes are considered. We
find that in previous studies the investigated phenomena in the evolution
time-window ($\lessapprox$2000 driving periods) are actually ""short-time""
transient behavior though DTC formation signaled by the sub-harmonic responses
is still shown if the inter-boson interaction is strong enough. After a much
longer (about 20 times) evolution time, initial states with no ""long-range""
correlations relax to a steady state, where time-symmetry breaking can be
unambiguously defined. Quantum revivals also eventually occur. This long-time
behavior can be understood via the many-body Floquet quasi-eigenenergy spectrum
of the two-mode model. A symmetry-breaking edge for DTC formation appears in
the spectrum for strong enough interaction, where all quasi-eigenstates below
the edge are symmetry-breaking while those above the edge are symmetric. The
late-time steady state's time-translational symmetry depends solely on whether
the initial energy is above or below the symmetry-breaking edge. A phase
diagram showing regions of symmetry-broken and symmetric phases for differing
initial energies and interaction strengths is presented. We find that according
to this two-mode model, the discrete time crystal survives for times out to at
least 250,000 driving periods.

and is one of the most common that affects women worldwide. For its early
detection, colposcopic images of the cervix are used for searching for possible
injuries or abnormalities. An inherent characteristic of these images is the
presence of specular reflections (brightness) that make it difficult to observe
some regions, which might imply misdiagnosis. In this paper, a new strategy
based on neural networks is introduced for eliminating specular reflections and
estimating the unobserved anatomical cervix portion under the bright zones. For
overcoming the fact that the ground truth corresponding to the specular
reflection regions is always unknown, the new strategy proposes the supervised
training of a neural network to learn how to restore any hidden regions of
colposcopic images. Once the specular reflections are identified, they are
removed from the image, and the previously trained network is used to fulfill
these deleted areas. The quality of the processed images was evaluated
quantitatively and qualitatively. In 21 of the 22 evaluated images, the
detected specular reflections were eliminated, whereas, in the remaining one,
these reflections were almost completely eliminated. The distribution of the
colors and the content of the restored images are similar to those of the
originals. The evaluation carried out by a specialist in Cervix Pathology
concluded that, after eliminating the specular reflections, the anatomical and
physiological elements of the cervix are observable in the restored images,
which facilitates the medical diagnosis of cervical pathologies. Our method has
the potential to improve the early detection of cervical cancer.

edge devices instead of cloud servers becomes increasingly attractive due to
privacy and network latency concerns. A common practice in building compact
on-device recommender systems is to compress their embeddings which are
normally the cause of excessive parameterization. However, despite the vast
variety of devices and their associated memory constraints, existing
memory-efficient recommender systems are only specialized for a fixed memory
budget in every design and training life cycle, where a new model has to be
retrained to obtain the optimal performance while adapting to a smaller/larger
memory budget. In this paper, we present a novel lightweight recommendation
paradigm that allows a well-trained recommender to be customized for arbitrary
device-specific memory constraints without retraining. The core idea is to
compose elastic embeddings for each item, where an elastic embedding is the
concatenation of a set of embedding blocks that are carefully chosen by an
automated search function. Correspondingly, we propose an innovative approach,
namely recommendation with universally learned elastic embeddings (RULE). To
ensure the expressiveness of all candidate embedding blocks, RULE enforces a
diversity-driven regularization when learning different embedding blocks. Then,
a performance estimator-based evolutionary search function is designed,
allowing for efficient specialization of elastic embeddings under any memory
constraint for on-device recommendation. Extensive experiments on real-world
datasets reveal the superior performance of RULE under tight memory budgets.

materials property prediction. Hurdles limiting full capitalization of recent
advancements in machine learning include the limited development of methods to
learn the underlying interactions of multiple elements, as well as the
relationships among multiple properties, to facilitate property prediction in
new composition spaces. To address these issues, we introduce the Hierarchical
Correlation Learning for Multi-property Prediction (H-CLMP) framework that
seamlessly integrates (i) prediction using only a material's composition, (ii)
learning and exploitation of correlations among target properties in
multi-target regression, and (iii) leveraging training data from tangential
domains via generative transfer learning. The model is demonstrated for
prediction of spectral optical absorption of complex metal oxides spanning 69
3-cation metal oxide composition spaces. H-CLMP accurately predicts non-linear
composition-property relationships in composition spaces for which no training
data is available, which broadens the purview of machine learning to the
discovery of materials with exceptional properties. This achievement results
from the principled integration of latent embedding learning, property
correlation learning, generative transfer learning, and attention models. The
best performance is obtained using H-CLMP with Transfer learning (H-CLMP(T))
wherein a generative adversarial network is trained on computational density of
states data and deployed in the target domain to augment prediction of optical
absorption from composition. H-CLMP(T) aggregates multiple knowledge sources
with a framework that is well-suited for multi-target regression across the
physical sciences.

about facts or opinions in a conversational session, known as its consistency
capacity. However, evaluating the consistency capacity of a chatbot is still
challenging. Employing human judges to interact with chatbots on purpose to
check their capacities is costly and low-efficient, and difficult to get rid of
subjective bias. In this paper, we propose the Addressing Inquiries about
History (AIH), an efficient and practical framework for the consistency
evaluation. At the conversation stage, AIH attempts to address appropriate
inquiries about the dialogue history to induce the chatbot to redeclare the
historical facts or opinions. We carry out the conversation between chatbots,
which is more efficient than the human-bot interaction and can also alleviate
the subjective bias. In this way, we manage to rapidly obtain a dialog session
that contains responses with high contradiction possibilities. At the
contradiction recognition stage, we can either employ human judges or a natural
language inference (NLI) model to recognize whether the answers to the
inquiries are contradictory with history. Finally, we are able to rank chatbots

show that our approach can efficiently and reliably assess the consistency

structural equations that are additive in the variables and error terms. We
take into account the presence of not only unobserved common causes but also
unobserved intermediate variables. Our theoretical results show that, when the
causal relationships are nonlinear and there are unobserved variables, it is
not possible to identify all the causal relationships between observed
variables through regression and independence tests. However, our theoretical
results also show that it is possible to avoid incorrect inferences. We propose
a method to identify all the causal relationships that are theoretically

aiming at unprecedented gravitational wave detections in the millihertz
frequency band. The spaceborne nature of the experimental setups leads to a
degree of subtlety regarding the otherwise overwhelming laser frequency noise.
The cancellation of the latter is accomplished through the time-delay
interferometry technique. Moreover, to eventually achieve the desired noise
level, the phase fluctuations of the onboard ultra-stable oscillator must also
be suppressed. This can be fulfilled by introducing sideband signals which, in
turn, give rise to an improved cancellation scheme accounting for the
clock-jitter noise. Nonetheless, for certain Sagnac-type interferometry
layouts, it can be shown that resultant residual clock noise found in the
literature can be further improved. In this regard, we propose refined
cancellation combinations for two specific clock noise patterns. This is
achieved by employing the so-called geometric time-delay interferometry
interpretation. It is shown that for specific Sagnac combinations, the residual
noise diminishes significantly to attain the experimentally acceptable
sensitivity level. Moreover, we argue that the derived combination, in addition
to the existing ones in the literature, furnishes a general-purpose
cancellation scheme that serves for arbitrary time-delay interferometry
combinations. The subsequential residual noise will only involve factors
proportional to the commutators between the delay operators. Our arguments
reside in the form of the clock noise expressed in terms of the coefficients of
the generating set of the first module of syzygies, the linear combination of

parameter-estimation technique for certain high-dimensional linear systems with
non-Gaussian distributions. However, AMP only applies to independent
identically distributed (IID) transform matrices, but may become unreliable for
other matrix ensembles, especially for ill-conditioned ones. To handle this
difficulty, orthogonal/vector AMP (OAMP/VAMP) was proposed for general
right-unitarily-invariant matrices. However, the Bayes-optimal OAMP/VAMP
requires high-complexity linear minimum mean square error estimator. To solve
the disadvantages of AMP and OAMP/VAMP, this paper proposes a memory AMP
(MAMP), in which a long-memory matched filter is proposed for interference
suppression. The complexity of MAMP is comparable to AMP. The asymptotic
Gaussianity of estimation errors in MAMP is guaranteed by the orthogonality
principle. A state evolution is derived to asymptotically characterize the
performance of MAMP. Based on the state evolution, the relaxation parameters
and damping vector in MAMP are optimized. For all right-unitarily-invariant

if it has a unique fixed point. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the

paradigms of star formation, dynamo theory, particle transport, magnetic
reconnection and evolution of structure in the interstellar medium (ISM) of
galaxies. Despite the importance of turbulence to astrophysical fluids, a full
theoretical framework based on solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations remains
intractable. Observations provide only limited line-of-sight information on
densities, temperatures, velocities and magnetic field strengths and therefore
directly measuring turbulence in the ISM is challenging. A statistical approach
has been of great utility in allowing comparisons of observations, simulations
and analytic predictions. In this review article we address the growing
importance of MHD turbulence in many fields of astrophysics and review
statistical diagnostics for studying interstellar and interplanetary
turbulence. In particular, we will review statistical diagnostics and machine
learning algorithms that have been developed for observational data sets in
order to obtain information about the turbulence cascade, fluid compressibility
(sonic Mach number), and magnetization of fluid (Alfv\'enic Mach number). These
techniques have often been tested on numerical simulations of MHD turbulence,
which may include the creation of synthetic observations, and are often
formulated on theoretical expectations for compressible magnetized turbulence.
We stress the use of multiple techniques, as this can provide a more accurate
indication of the turbulence parameters of interest. We conclude by describing
several open-source tools for the astrophysical community to use when dealing
with turbulence.

topic in recent years. This paper demonstrates that the observable interaction
process of MRNs under formation control will present increasingly severe
threats. Specifically, we find that an external attack robot, who has only
partial observation over MRNs while not knowing the system dynamics or access,
can learn the interaction rules from observations and utilize them to replace a
target robot, destroying the cooperation performance of MRNs. We call this
novel attack as sneak, which endows the attacker with the intelligence of
learning knowledge and is hard to be tackled by traditional defense techniques.
The key insight is to separately reveal the internal interaction structure
within robots and the external interaction mechanism with the environment, from
the coupled state evolution influenced by the model-unknown rules and
unobservable part of the MRN. To address this issue, we first provide general
interaction process modeling and prove the learnability of the interaction
rules. Then, with the learned rules, we design an Evaluate-Cut-Restore (ECR)
attack strategy considering the partial interaction structure and geometric
pattern. We also establish the sufficient conditions for a successful sneak
with maximum control impacts over the MRN. Extensive simulations illustrate the
feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed attack.

which first pretrain the model in general data and then finetune the model on

notorious for their enormous parameters and hard to be deployed on real-life
applications. Knowledge distillation has been prevailing to address this
problem by transferring knowledge from a large teacher to a much smaller
student over a set of data. We argue that the selection of thee three key
components, namely teacher, training data, and learning objective, is crucial
to the effectiveness of distillation. We, therefore, propose a four-stage
progressive distillation framework ERNIE-Tiny to compress PLM, which varies the
three components gradually from general level to task-specific level.
Specifically, the first stage, General Distillation, performs distillation with
guidance from pretrained teacher, gerenal data and latent distillation loss.
Then, General-Enhanced Distillation changes teacher model from pretrained
teacher to finetuned teacher. After that, Task-Adaptive Distillation shifts
training data from general data to task-specific data. In the end,
Task-Specific Distillation, adds two additional losses, namely Soft-Label and
Hard-Label loss onto the last stage. Empirical results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework and generalization gain brought by ERNIE-Tiny.In
particular, experiments show that a 4-layer ERNIE-Tiny maintains over
98.0%performance of its 12-layer teacher BERT base on GLUE benchmark,
surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 1.0% GLUE score with the same amount of

However, for a sensor network with a massive number of nodes, a single
frequency channel may not be sufficient to accommodate the large number of
sensors, and the AirComp performance will be very limited. So it is highly
desirable to have more frequency channels for large-scale AirComp systems to
benefit from multi-channel diversity. In this letter, we propose an
$M$-frequency AirComp system, where each sensor selects a subset of the $M$
frequencies and broadcasts its signal over these channels under a certain power
constraint. We derive the optimal sensors' transmission and receiver's signal

general method for event detection on social media that makes few assumptions.
The main assumption we make is that when an event occurs, affected semantic

representation of time units based on word embeddings of social media text, and
propose an algorithm to detect events in time series in a general sense. In the
experimental evaluation, we use a novel setting to test if our method and

between and within cables. We formalize the problem of disentangling multiple
cables and present an algorithm, Iterative Reduction Of Non-planar Multiple
cAble kNots (IRON-MAN), that outputs robot actions to remove crossings from
multi-cable knotted structures. We instantiate this algorithm with a learned
perception system, inspired by prior work in single-cable untying that given an
image input, can disentangle two-cable twists, three-cable braids, and knots of
two or three cables, such as overhand, square, carrick bend, sheet bend, crown,
and fisherman's knots. IRON-MAN keeps track of task-relevant keypoints
corresponding to target cable endpoints and crossings and iteratively
disentangles the cables by identifying and undoing crossings that are critical
to knot structure. Using a da Vinci surgical robot, we experimentally evaluate
the effectiveness of IRON-MAN on untangling multi-cable knots of types that
appear in the training data, as well as generalizing to novel classes of
multi-cable knots. Results suggest that IRON-MAN is effective in disentangling
knots involving up to three cables with 80.5% success and generalizing to knot
types that are not present during training, with cables of both distinct or
identical colors.

in deep neural networks, where the former extracts local image features in a
linear way while the latter non-locally encodes high-order contextual
relationships. Though essentially complementary to each other, i.e.,
first-/high-order, stat-of-the-art architectures, i.e., CNNs or transformers
lack a principled way to simultaneously apply both operations in a single
computational module, due to their heterogeneous computing pattern and
excessive burden of global dot-product for visual tasks. In this work, we
theoretically derive a global self-attention approximation scheme, which
approximates a self-attention via the convolution operation on transformed
features. Based on the approximated scheme, we establish a multi-branch
elementary module composed of both convolution and self-attention operation,
capable of unifying both local and non-local feature interaction. Importantly,
once trained, this multi-branch module could be conditionally converted into a
single standard convolution operation via structural re-parameterization,
rendering a pure convolution styled operator named X-volution, ready to be
plugged into any modern networks as an atomic operation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed X-volution, achieves highly competitive visual

For simplicity, we start with analyzing the DC power flow (DC-PF) model and
then extend our algorithms to the AC power flow (AC-PF) model. The main
assumption behind the proposed GSP approach is that the grid states, which
include the vector of phases and the vector of the magnitudes of the voltages
in the system, is a smooth graph signal with respect to the system admittance
matrix that represents the underlying graph. Thus, the first step in this paper
is to validate the graph-smoothness assumption of the states, both empirically
and theoretically. Then, we develop the regularized GSP weighted least squares
(GSP-WLS) state estimator, which does not require observability of the network.
We propose a sensor placement strategy that aims to optimize the estimation
performance of the GSP-WLS estimator. Finally, we extend the GSP-WLS estimator
method to the AC-PF model by integrating a smoothness regularization term into
the Gauss-Newton algorithm. Numerical results on the IEEE 118-bus system
demonstrate that the new GSP methods outperform commonly-used estimation
approaches and are robust to missing data.

results show that our method of fusing social media background with the

  Unit Recognition",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Current works formulate facial action unit (AU) recognition as a supervised
learning problem, requiring fully AU-labeled facial images during training. It
is challenging if not impossible to provide AU annotations for large numbers of
facial images. Fortunately, AUs appear on all facial images, whether manually
labeled or not, satisfy the underlying anatomic mechanisms and human behavioral
habits. In this paper, we propose a deep semi-supervised framework for facial
action unit recognition from partially AU-labeled facial images. Specifically,
the proposed deep semi-supervised AU recognition approach consists of a deep
recognition network and a discriminator D. The deep recognition network R
learns facial representations from large-scale facial images and AU classifiers
from limited ground truth AU labels. The discriminator D is introduced to
enforce statistical similarity between the AU distribution inherent in ground
truth AU labels and the distribution of the predicted AU labels from labeled
and unlabeled facial images. The deep recognition network aims to minimize
recognition loss from the labeled facial images, to faithfully represent
inherent AU distribution for both labeled and unlabeled facial images, and to
confuse the discriminator. During training, the deep recognition network R and
the discriminator D are optimized alternately. Thus, the inherent AU
distributions caused by underlying anatomic mechanisms are leveraged to
construct better feature representations and AU classifiers from partially
AU-labeled data during training. Experiments on two benchmark databases
demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully captures AU distributions
through adversarial learning and outperforms state-of-the-art AU recognition

captures several natural scenarios such as the allocation of multiple
facilities over time where each agent can utilize at most one facility
simultaneously, and the allocation of tasks over time where each agent can
perform at most one task simultaneously. We establish the existence of an
envy-free multi-division that is both non-overlapping and contiguous within
each layer when the number of agents is a prime power and the number of layers
is at most the number of agents, providing a positive partial answer to an open
question by Hosseini et al. To achieve this, we employ a new approach based on
a general fixed point theorem, originally proven by Volovikov (1996), and
recently applied by Joji\'{c}, Panina, and \v{Z}ivaljevi\'{c} (2020) to the
envy-free division problem of a cake. We further design a fully polynomial-time
approximation scheme (FPTAS) to find an approximate envy-free solution that is
both non-overlapping and contiguous for a two-layered cake division among three
agents with monotone preferences. More generally, we establish all the results
for divisions among groups of almost the same size. When there are three groups
and one layer, our FPTAS is actually able to deal with groups of any
predetermined sizes, still under the monotone preference assumptions. For three
groups, this provides thus an algorithmic version of a recent theorem by
Segal-Halevi and Suksompong (2021). A classical lemma from topology ensures
that every self-map of a simplex mapping each facet to itself is surjective.
This lemma has often been used in economics theory and our algorithm can be

modeling. They combine advantages of probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) with
those of neural networks (NNs). Crucially, however, they are tractable
probabilistic models, supporting efficient and exact computation of many
probabilistic inference queries, such as marginals and MAP. Further, since PCs
are structured computation graphs, they can take advantage of
deep-learning-style parameter updates, which greatly improves their
scalability. However, this innovation also makes PCs prone to overfitting,
which has been observed in many standard benchmarks. Despite the existence of
abundant regularization techniques for both PGMs and NNs, they are not
effective enough when applied to PCs. Instead, we re-think regularization for
PCs and propose two intuitive techniques, data softening and entropy
regularization, that both take advantage of PCs' tractability and still have an
efficient implementation as a computation graph. Specifically, data softening
provides a principled way to add uncertainty in datasets in closed form, which
implicitly regularizes PC parameters. To learn parameters from a softened
dataset, PCs only need linear time by virtue of their tractability. In entropy
regularization, the exact entropy of the distribution encoded by a PC can be
regularized directly, which is again infeasible for most other density
estimation models. We show that both methods consistently improve the
generalization performance of a wide variety of PCs. Moreover, when paired with
a simple PC structure, we achieved state-of-the-art results on 10 out of 20

a growing surge of interest in learning good explanations that are hard to

Generalization. The search for good explanations that are \textit{invariant}

polynomials. Related multi-dimensional ($nD$) Huffman arrays were designed, as
well as non-canonical quasi-Huffman arrays that also possess delta-like
auto-correlations. We examined links between these discrete sequences and
delta-correlated functions defined on the continuum, and provided simple
non-iterative approaches to successfully deconvolve $nD$ data blurred by
diffuse Huffman arrays. Here we describe new constructions for canonical

normalized permutation entropy at the feedback delay time, respectively.
Quantum noise from quadrature fluctuations of vacuum state is prepared through
balanced homodyne measurement. The effects of strength and bandwidth of quantum
noise on chaotic TDS suppression and complexity enhancement are investigated
numerically and experimentally. Compared to the original dynamics, the TDS of
this quantum-noise improved chaos is suppressed up to 94% and the bandwidth
suppression ratio of quantum noise to chaotic laser is 1:25. The experiment
agrees well with the theory. The improved chaotic laser is potentially
beneficial to chaos-based random number generation and secure communication.

  Surface Aided High-Mobility Communication","Conference version (arXiv:2011.03147). Accepted by TWC",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Intelligent reflecting/refracting surface (IRS) has recently emerged as a
promising solution to reconfigure wireless propagation environment for
enhancing the communication performance. In this paper, we study a new
IRS-aided high-mobility communication system by employing the intelligent
refracting surface with a high-speed vehicle to aid its passenger's
communication with a remote base station (BS). Due to the environment's random
scattering and vehicle's high mobility, a rapidly time-varying channel is
typically resulted between the static BS and fast-moving IRS/user, which
renders the channel estimation for IRS with a large number of elements more
challenging. In order to reap the high IRS passive beamforming gain with low
channel training overhead, we propose a new and efficient transmission protocol
to achieve both IRS channel estimation and refraction optimization for data
transmission. Specifically, by exploiting the quasi-static channel between the
IRS and user both moving at the same high speed as well as the line-of-sight
(LoS) dominant channel between the BS and IRS, the user first estimates the LoS
component of the cascaded BS-IRS-user channel, based on which IRS passive
refraction is designed to maximize the corresponding IRS-refracted channel
gain. Then, the user estimates the resultant IRS-refracted channel as well as
the non-IRS-refracted channel for setting an additional common phase shift at
all IRS refracting elements so as to align these two channels for maximizing
the overall channel gain for data transmission. Simulation results show
significant performance improvement of the proposed design as compared to
various benchmark schemes. The proposed on-vehicle IRS system is further
compared with a baseline scheme of deploying fixed intelligent reflecting
surfaces on the roadside to assist high-speed vehicular communications, which
achieves significant rate improvement.

emission around the Geminga and Monogem pulsars of a few degree extension. Very
recently, the LHAASO Collaboration released also the data for an extended
$\gamma$-ray emission around the pulsar PSR J0622+3749. This flux can be
explained with electrons and positrons injected from these sources and their
inverse Compton Scattering on the interstellar radiation fields. So far the
size of such $\gamma-$ray halos has been interpreted as the result of the
diffusion coefficient around the sources being about two orders of magnitude
smaller than the average in the Galaxy. However, this conclusion is driven by
the assumption that particles propagate diffusively right away after the
injection without taking into account the ballistic propagation. The
propagation of cosmic-ray leptons in the proximity of the Geminga, Monogem and
PSR J0622+3749 pulsars is examined here considering the transition from the
quasi-ballistic, valid for the most recently injected particles, to the
diffusive transport regime. For typical interstellar values of the diffusion
coefficient, the quasi-ballistic regime dominates the lepton distribution up to
distances of a few tens of parsec from the pulsar for particle energies above
$\sim 10$ TeV. In this regime the resulting $\gamma-$ray source tends to be
rather compact, despite particles travel a long distance. Indeed, for larger
values of the diffusion coefficient, particles propagate ballistically up to
larger distances with the result of a more point-like $\gamma-$ray source. When
such transition is taken into account, a good fit to the HAWC and LHAASO
$\gamma-$ray data around Geminga, Monogem and PSR J0622+3749 is obtained
without the need to invoke a strong suppression of the diffusion coefficient.

stabilize the system. In this work, we extend the previous stability criterion
that only considered the companion-planet and planet-planet interactions by
also accounting for short-range forces or effects, specifically, relativistic
precession induced by the host star. A general analytical stability criterion
is developed for planetary systems with $N$ inner planets and a relatively
distant inclined perturber by comparing precession rates of relevant dynamical
effects. Furthermore, we demonstrate as examples that in systems with $2$ and
$3$ inner planets, the analytical criterion is consistent with numerical
simulations using a combination of Gauss's averaging method and direct N-body
integration. Finally, the criterion is applied to observed systems,
constraining the orbital parameter space of a possible undiscovered companion.
This new stability criterion extends the parameter space in which an inclined
companion of multi-planet systems can inhabit.

performance with a more compact model size than conventional convolutional
neural networks, thanks to the strong ability of Transformers to model
long-range dependencies. However, the advantages of vision Transformers also
come with a price: Self-attention, the core part of Transformer, has a
quadratic complexity to the input sequence length. This leads to a dramatic
increase of computation and memory cost with the increase of sequence length,
thus introducing difficulties when applying Transformers to the vision tasks
that require dense predictions based on high-resolution feature maps. In this
paper, we propose a new vision Transformer, named Glance-and-Gaze Transformer
(GG-Transformer), to address the aforementioned issues. It is motivated by the
Glance and Gaze behavior of human beings when recognizing objects in natural
scenes, with the ability to efficiently model both long-range dependencies and
local context. In GG-Transformer, the Glance and Gaze behavior is realized by
two parallel branches: The Glance branch is achieved by performing
self-attention on the adaptively-dilated partitions of the input, which leads
to a linear complexity while still enjoying a global receptive field; The Gaze
branch is implemented by a simple depth-wise convolutional layer, which
compensates local image context to the features obtained by the Glance
mechanism. We empirically demonstrate our method achieves consistently superior
performance over previous state-of-the-art Transformers on various vision tasks

Here, the user input of the current turn is parsed into the corresponding SQL

approaches mostly employ end-to-end models and consequently face two
challenges. First, dialogue history modeling and Text-to-SQL parsing are
implicitly combined, hence it is hard to carry out interpretable analysis and
obtain targeted improvement. Second, SQL annotation of multi-turn dialogue is
very expensive, leading to training data sparsity. In this paper, we propose a
novel decoupled multi-turn Text-to-SQL framework, where an utterance rewrite
model first explicitly solves completion of dialogue context, and then a
single-turn Text-to-SQL parser follows. A dual learning approach is also
proposed for the utterance rewrite model to address the data sparsity problem.
Compared with end-to-end approaches, the proposed decoupled method can achieve
excellent performance without any annotated in-domain data. With just a few
annotated rewrite cases, the decoupled method outperforms the released

considered. One of the reasons is the computational difficulty of the accurate
consideration of Moir\'e superlattices that appear due to the superimposition
of misaligned lattices. Indeed, the unit cell of the complex lattice is
typically much larger than the original crystals and requires much more
computational resources for the computations. Here, we propose a careful
adaptation of the Fourier modal method in the form of the scattering matrices

consider sublattices in close vicinity to each other and account for their
interaction via the near-field. In the developed numerical scheme, we utilize
the fact that each sublattice is only 1D-periodic and therefore simpler than
the resulting 2D superlattice, as well as the fact that even a small gap
between the lattices filters out high Fourier harmonics due to their evanescent
origin. This accelerates the computations from 1 up to 3 and more orders of

paves the way for rigorous study of almost any photonic crystals of the

method which splits one face into four. Thereby, many popular 2D CNN

negatively biased probabilities for any oov word form, while positively biased
probabilities to in-corpus words. In this work, we argue in favor of properly
modeling the unigram distribution -- claiming it should be a central task in
natural language processing. With this in mind, we present a novel model for
estimating it in a language (a neuralization of Goldwater et al.'s (2011)
model) and show it produces much better estimates across a diverse set of 7
languages than the na\""ive use of neural character-level language models.

Theory",,,,"math.ST cs.IT math.IT math.PR stat.ME stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The problem of completing a large matrix with lots of missing entries has
received widespread attention in the last couple of decades. Two popular
approaches to the matrix completion problem are based on singular value
thresholding and nuclear norm minimization. Most of the past works on this
subject assume that there is a single number $p$ such that each entry of the
matrix is available independently with probability $p$ and missing otherwise.
This assumption may not be realistic for many applications. In this work, we
replace it with the assumption that the probability that an entry is available
is an unknown function $f$ of the entry itself. For example, if the entry is
the rating given to a movie by a viewer, then it seems plausible that high
value entries have greater probability of being available than low value
entries. We propose two new estimators, based on singular value thresholding
and nuclear norm minimization, to recover the matrix under this assumption. The
estimators involve no tuning parameters, and are shown to be consistent under a
low rank assumption. We also provide a consistent estimator of the unknown
function $f$.

with the theoretical expectation of lepton flavor universality within the

ratio of ${\Gamma}_{D^0\to \rho^- \mu^+ \nu_{\mu}}/(2{\Gamma}_{D^+\to \rho^0

  2021",,,,"gr-qc hep-th","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The present thesis attempts to study the effect of scalar fields on Hawking
radiation and quasinormal modes of black holes. We selected a static,
spherically symmetric electrically charged black hole with an additional scalar
'hair' for our analysis. The scalar 'hair' is sourced by a scalar field,
conformally coupled to the Einstein-Hilbert action. The scalar field can
survive even in the absence of the black hole's electric charge and is
characterized as a 'primary hair'. This scalar field changes the gravitational
constant, and hence modifies the ADM (Arnowitt-Deser-Missner) mass of the black
hole. The scalar field's strength is determined by a scalar 'charge' that
manifests itself as an additive correction to the square of the electric charge
in the standard Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m metric. This seemingly simple
modification leads to nontrivial physical implications.

focusing on the factors that control its morphology. We propose a theoretical
model for the curtain in which particle trajectories result from the
composition of two motions: a horizontal component corresponding to the
evolving axial velocity profile of an axisymmetric viscous jet, and a vertical
component due to free fall under gravity. The model predicts well the
trajectory of the primary jet, but somewhat less well that of the secondary
jet. We suggest that the remaining discrepancy may be explained by surface
tension-driven (Taylor-Culick) retraction of the secondary jet. Finally, direct
numerical simulation reveals recirculating 'Dean' vortices in vertical sections
of the primary jet, placing Torricelli's curtain firmly within the context of

recovering high-frequency details by utilizing an external reference image
(Ref). In this task, texture details are transferred from the Ref image to the
low-resolution (LR) image according to their point- or patch-wise
correspondence. Therefore, high-quality correspondence matching is critical. It
is also desired to be computationally efficient. Besides, existing RefSR
methods tend to ignore the potential large disparity in distributions between
the LR and Ref images, which hurts the effectiveness of the information
utilization. In this paper, we propose the MASA network for RefSR, where two
novel modules are designed to address these problems. The proposed Match &
Extraction Module significantly reduces the computational cost by a
coarse-to-fine correspondence matching scheme. The Spatial Adaptation Module
learns the difference of distribution between the LR and Ref images, and remaps
the distribution of Ref features to that of LR features in a spatially adaptive
way. This scheme makes the network robust to handle different reference images.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness
of our proposed model.

interpolation weights vary over a wide range and have to be tuned extensively

Additional gradient is induced when internal LM is engaged in MWER-ILME loss

enable robust LM integrations on test sets from different domains. Experimented

decentralized data stored at edge client devices by periodically aggregating
locally trained models. Popular optimization algorithms of FL use vanilla
(stochastic) gradient descent for both local updates at clients and global
updates at the aggregating server. Recently, adaptive optimization methods such
as AdaGrad have been studied for server updates. However, the effect of using
adaptive optimization methods for local updates at clients is not yet
understood. We show in both theory and practice that while local adaptive
methods can accelerate convergence, they can cause a non-vanishing solution
bias, where the final converged solution may be different from the stationary
point of the global objective function. We propose correction techniques to
overcome this inconsistency and complement the local adaptive methods for FL.
Extensive experiments on realistic federated training tasks show that the
proposed algorithms can achieve faster convergence and higher test accuracy
than the baselines without local adaptivity.

quality assurance. Using these tools, reviewers are able to post a linkage

use a review-then-commit model risk being unaware of these linkages. Objective:
Our objective is to first explore how patch linkage impacts the review process.
We then propose and evaluate models that detect patch linkage based on
realistic time intervals. Method: First, we carry out an exploratory study on
three open source projects to conduct linkage impact analysis using 942
manually classified linkages. Second, we propose two techniques using textual
and file location similarity to build detection models and evaluate their
performance. Results: The study provides evidence of latency in the linkage
notification. We show that a patch with the Alternative Solution linkage (i.e.,
patches that implement similar functionality)undergoes a quicker review and
avoids additional revisions after the team has been notified, compared to other
linkage types. Our detection model experiments show promising recall rates for
the Alternative Solution linkage (from 32% to 95%), but precision has room for
improvement. Conclusion: Patch linkage detection is promising, with likely
improvements if the practice of posting linkages becomes more prevalent. From

collections of words in Pf(L(A)) -- the set of prefixes of words belonging to
the regular language accepted by A. But words can be ordered and among the many
possible orders a very natural one is the co-lexicographic one. Such
naturalness stems from the fact that it suggests a transfer of the order from
words to the automaton's states. In a number of papers automata admitting a
total ordering of states coherent with the ordering of the set of words
reaching them have been proposed. Such class of ordered automata -- the Wheeler
automata -- turned out to be efficiently stored/searched using an index.
Unfortunately not all automata can be totally ordered as previously outlined.
However, automata can always be partially ordered and an intrinsic measure of
their complexity can be defined and effectively determined, as the minimum
width of one of their admissible partial orders. As shown in previous works,
this new concept of width of an automaton has useful consequences in the fields
of graph compression, indexing data structures, and automata theory. In this
paper we prove that a canonical, minimum-width, partially-ordered automaton
accepting a language L -- dubbed the Hasse automaton H of L -- can be
exhibited. H provides, in a precise sense, the best possible way to (partially)
order the states of any automaton accepting L, as long as we want to maintain
an operational link with the (co-lexicographic) order of Pf(L(A)). Using H we
prove that the width of the language can be effectively computed from the
minimum automaton recognizing the language. Finally, we explore the
relationship between two (often conflicting) objectives: minimizing the width
and minimizing the number of states of an automaton.

Client Contribution Evaluation through Accuracy Approximation(FedCCEA). This

simulated test accuracy using inputs of sampled data size and extracts the
clients' data quality and data size to measure client contribution. FedCCEA
strengthens some advantages: (1) enablement of data size selection to the
clients, (2) feasible evaluation time regardless of the number of clients, and
(3) precise estimation in non-IID settings. We demonstrate the superiority of
FedCCEA compared to previous methods through several experiments: client

to novel classes with few exemplars. The conventional training paradigm is to
learn to make predictions on query images conditioned on the features from
support images. Previous methods only utilized the semantic-level prototypes of
support images as conditional information. These methods cannot utilize all
pixel-wise support information for the query predictions, which is however
critical for the segmentation task. In this paper, we focus on utilizing
pixel-wise relationships between support and query images to facilitate the
few-shot segmentation task. We design a novel Cycle-Consistent TRansformer
(CyCTR) module to aggregate pixel-wise support features into query ones. CyCTR
performs cross-attention between features from different images, i.e. support
and query images. We observe that there may exist unexpected irrelevant
pixel-level support features. Directly performing cross-attention may aggregate
these features from support to query and bias the query features. Thus, we
propose using a novel cycle-consistent attention mechanism to filter out
possible harmful support features and encourage query features to attend to the
most informative pixels from support images. Experiments on all few-shot
segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed CyCTR leads to remarkable
improvement compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, on
Pascal-$5^i$ and COCO-$20^i$ datasets, we achieve 67.5% and 45.6% mIoU for

Inspired by the success of sequence masking, we argue that both token-level and

a pair of masked sequences from an input sequence for sequence-level
contrastive learning and then develop contrastive masked language modeling

that the generating function for partitions is an infinite product, while that
of unimodal sequences is not. Essentially, we get around this by conditioning
on the size of the largest part and working uniformly on contributing summands.
Our framework may be used to derive many distributions, and our results include

$\mathcal P$ and an integer $k$, and the question is if there exist $k$ convex
polygons whose union is $\mathcal P$. It is known that MCC is
$\mathsf{NP}$-hard [Culberson & Reckhow: Covering polygons is hard, FOCS
1988/Journal of Algorithms 1994] and in $\exists\mathbb{R}$ [O'Rourke: The
complexity of computing minimum convex covers for polygons, Allerton 1982]. We
prove that MCC is $\exists\mathbb{R}$-hard, and the problem is thus
$\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete. In other words, the problem is equivalent to
deciding whether a system of polynomial equations and inequalities with integer
coefficients has a real solution.
  If a cover for our constructed polygon exists, then so does a cover
consisting entirely of triangles. As a byproduct, we therefore also establish
that it is $\exists\mathbb{R}$-complete to decide whether $k$ triangles cover a
given polygon.
  The issue that it was not known if finding a minimum cover is in
$\mathsf{NP}$ has repeatedly been raised in the literature, and it was
mentioned as a ""long-standing open question"" already in 2001 [Eidenbenz &
Widmayer: An approximation algorithm for minimum convex cover with logarithmic
performance guarantee, ESA 2001/SIAM Journal on Computing 2003]. We prove that
assuming the widespread belief that $\mathsf{NP}\neq\exists\mathbb{R}$, the
problem is not in $\mathsf{NP}$.
  An implication of the result is that many natural approaches to finding small
covers are bound to give suboptimal solutions in some cases, since irrational
coordinates of arbitrarily high algebraic degree can be needed for the corners
of the pieces in an optimal solution.

boundary conditions and double-row monodromy matrix, developed by Sklyanin,
which characterize initial-boundary value problems for NLS on an interval. It
follows from Sklyanin's approach that a hierarchy of integrable boundary
conditions can be derived based on a semi-discrete type Lax pair involving the
time-part Lax matrix of NLS and a reflection matrix. The inverse scattering
transform relies on the formulation of a scattering system for the double-row
monodromy matrix characterizing an interval problem. The scattering system for
the half-line problem for NLS is obtained by extending one endpoint of the
interval to infinity. Then, we derive spectral and analytic properties of the
scattering systems, and set up the inverse part using a Riemann-Hilbert
formulation. We also show that our approach is equivalent to a nonlinear method
of reflection by extending the initial-boundary value problem on the half-line
to an initial value on the whole axis. Explicit examples of soliton solutions
on the half-line are provided. Although we only consider the NLS model as a

The key idea of F-Drop is to filter out unnecessary high-frequency components
from the input images of the discriminators. This simple modification prevents
the discriminators from being confused by perturbations of the high-frequency
components. In addition, F-Drop makes the GANs focus on fitting in the
low-frequency domain, in which there are the dominant components of natural
images. F-Match minimizes the difference between real and fake images in the
frequency domain for generating more realistic images. F-Match is implemented
as a regularization term in the objective functions of the generators; it
penalizes the batch mean error in the frequency domain. F-Match helps the
generators to fit in the high-frequency domain filtered out by F-Drop to the
real image. We experimentally demonstrate that the combination of F-Drop and
F-Match improves the generative performance of GANs in both the frequency and
spatial domain on multiple image benchmarks.

recent approaches attempt to learn the electronic wavefunction (or density) as
a central quantity of atomistic systems, from which all other observables can
be derived. This is complicated by the fact that wavefunctions transform
non-trivially under molecular rotations, which makes them a challenging
prediction target. To solve this issue, we introduce general SE(3)-equivariant
operations and building blocks for constructing deep learning architectures for
geometric point cloud data and apply them to reconstruct wavefunctions of
atomistic systems with unprecedented accuracy. Our model achieves speedups of
over three orders of magnitude compared to ab initio methods and reduces

demonstrate the potential of our approach in a transfer learning application,

to correct for electronic many-body interactions from observables computed at a
higher level of theory. Such machine-learned wavefunction surrogates pave the
way towards novel semi-empirical methods, offering resolution at an electronic
level while drastically decreasing computational cost. Additionally, the
predicted wavefunctions can serve as initial guess in conventional ab initio
methods, decreasing the number of iterations required to arrive at a converged

hypergraph Laplacian is non-linear, and thus lacks the linear-algebraic
structure and tools that have been so effective for graphs.
  Our main contribution is the first algorithm for constructing
$\epsilon$-spectral sparsifiers for hypergraphs with $O^*(n)$ hyperedges, where
$O^*$ suppresses $(\epsilon^{-1} \log n)^{O(1)}$ factors. This bound is
independent of the rank $r$ (maximum cardinality of a hyperedge), and is
essentially best possible due to a recent bit complexity lower bound of
$\Omega(nr)$ for hypergraph sparsification.
  This result is obtained by introducing two new tools. First, we give a new
proof of spectral concentration bounds for sparsifiers of graphs; it avoids
linear-algebraic methods, replacing e.g.~the usual application of the matrix
Bernstein inequality and therefore applies to the (non-linear) hypergraph
setting. To achieve the result, we design a new sequence of
hypergraph-dependent $\epsilon$-nets on the unit sphere in $\mathbb{R}^n$.
Second, we extend the weight assignment technique of Chen, Khanna and Nagda
[FOCS'20] to the spectral sparsification setting. Surprisingly, the number of
spanning trees after the weight assignment can serve as a potential function
guiding the reweighting process in the spectral setting.

an open quantum system based on partial measurement information both prior and
posterior to the time of interest. In this paper, we show that the smoothed
quantum state is an optimal state estimator; that is, it minimizes a risk
(expected cost) function. Specifically, we show that the smoothed quantum state
is optimal with respect to two cost functions: the trace-square deviation from
and the relative entropy to the unknown true state. However, when we consider a
related risk function, the linear infidelity, we find, contrary to what one
might expect, that the smoothed state is not optimal. For this case, we derive
the optimal state estimator, which we call the lustrated smoothed state. It is
a pure state, the eigenstate of the smoothed quantum state with the largest

estimator, and sharp results on its performance have been obtained in the
high-dimensional regime. Recently, an Approximate Message Passing (AMP)
algorithm has been proposed as an alternative estimator with the potential to
improve the accuracy of PCA. However, the existing analysis of AMP requires an
initialization that is both correlated with the signal and independent of the
noise, which is often unrealistic in practice. In this work, we combine the two
methods, and propose to initialize AMP with PCA. Our main result is a rigorous
asymptotic characterization of the performance of this estimator. Both the AMP
algorithm and its analysis differ from those previously derived in the Gaussian
setting: at every iteration, our AMP algorithm requires a specific term to
account for PCA initialization, while in the Gaussian case, PCA initialization
affects only the first iteration of AMP. The proof is based on a two-phase
artificial AMP that first approximates the PCA estimator and then mimics the
true AMP. Our numerical simulations show an excellent agreement between AMP
results and theoretical predictions, and suggest an interesting open direction
on achieving Bayes-optimal performance.

regression to identify important features helpful in predicting the dependent
variable. It not only helps in getting interpretable results but also avoids
overfitting when the number of features is large, and the amount of data is
small. The most natural way to achieve this is by using `best subset selection'
which penalizes non-zero model parameters by adding $\ell_0$ norm over
parameters to the least squares loss. However, this makes the objective
function non-convex and intractable even for a small number of features. This
paper aims to address the intractability of sparse linear regression with
$\ell_0$ norm using adiabatic quantum computing, a quantum computing paradigm
that is particularly useful for solving optimization problems faster. We
formulate the $\ell_0$ optimization problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary

advent of Release 16 New Radio (NR) positioning, it is possible to configure
Positioning Reference Signal (PRS) with wide bandwidth that naturally helps
improving the positioning accuracy. However, the improvement is evident when
the conditions are ideal for positioning. In practice where the conditions are
non-ideal and the positioning accuracy is severely impacted, estimating the
uncertainty in position estimation becomes important and can provide
significant insight on how reliable a position estimation is. In order to
determine the uncertainty in position estimation we resort to Machine Learning

also assess the uncertainty of the estimated position. The results show that
both GP and RF not only achieve satisfactory positioning accuracy but also give

reduced nonlinear terms, respectively. For this work, we focus on the proper
orthogonal decomposition and discrete empirical interpolation methods. While
similar approaches based on the group finite element method only focus on
semilinear problems, our proposed framework is also compatible with quasilinear
problems. Compared to existing methods, our reduced models prove to be superior
in many different aspects as demonstrated in three numerical benchmark

efficient algorithm for online safety monitoring for Linear Time-Invariant

symbolic reachable sets in terms of the estimated physical state of the system.
These sets are then instantiated online, and safety checks are performed by
leveraging ideas from ellipsoidal calculus. We illustrate and evaluate our
approach using the Tennessee-Eastman process. We also compare our approach with
the baseline monitoring approaches proposed in previous work and assess its
efficiency and scalability. Our evaluation results demonstrate that our
approach can predict in a timely manner if a false data injection attack will
be able to cause damage, while remaining undetected. Thus, our approach can be
used to provide operators with real-time early warnings about stealthy attacks.

individual emitters to bulk emission by fluorescence lifetime measurements, and
find a transition to occur on a length scale of $\sim 3$ wavelengths around the

an ensemble of collectively contributing domains to the emission. Therefore, we

the single-chain consensus schemes. The multi-chains consensus with trusted
miners participation has been not considered, thus offering opportunities for
malicious users to launch Diverse Miners Behaviors (DMB) attacks on different
chains. DMB attackers can be friendly in the consensus process of some chains
called mask-chains to enhance trust value, while on other chains called
kill-chains they engage in destructive behaviors of network. In this paper, we
propose a multi-chains consensus scheme named as Proof-of-DiscTrust (PoDT) to
defend against DMB attacks. Distinctive trust idea (DiscTrust) is introduced to
evaluate the trust value of each user concerning different chains. A dynamic
behaviors prediction scheme is designed to strengthen DiscTrust to prevent
intensive DMB attackers who maintain high trust by alternately creating true or
false blocks on kill-chains. On this basis, a trusted miners selection
algorithm for multi-chains can be achieved at a round of block creation.
Experimental results show that PoDT is secure against DMB attacks and more
effective than traditional consensus schemes in multi-chains environments.

temperature, mood, age, sex, any pathologies, a hormonal activity that may
intrinsically influence the differences between OBP and ABPM. The aim of this

OBP and ABPM in 872 subjects with known or suspected hypertension. A
significant correlation was observed between OBP and ABPM mean values
calculated during the day, night and 24h (ABPMday, ABPMnight, ABPM24h) in both
groups (p<0.0001). The main finding of this study is that no difference between
sexes was observed in the relation between OBP and mean ABMP values except
between systolic OBP and systolic ABPM during the night. In addition, this
study showed a moderate correlation between BPs obtained with the two
approaches with a great dispersion around the regression line which suggests
that the two approaches cannot be used interchangeably.

satisfaction problem (CSP) with an interval domain $U \subset \mathbb{R}$. We
engage in a systematic study to classify CCSPs that are complete of the
Existential Theory of the Reals, i.e., ER-complete. To define this class, we
first consider the problem ETR, which also stands for Existential Theory of the
Reals. In an instance of this problem we are given some sentence of the form
$\exists x_1, \ldots, x_n \in \mathbb{R} : \Phi(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$, where
$\Phi$ is a well-formed quantifier-free formula consisting of the symbols $\{0,
1, +, \cdot, \geq, >, \wedge, \vee, \neg\}$, the goal is to check whether this
sentence is true. Now the class ER is the family of all problems that admit a
polynomial-time many-one reduction to ETR. It is known that NP $\subseteq$ ER
$\subseteq$ PSPACE.
  We restrict our attention on CCSPs with addition constraints ($x + y = z$)
and some other mild technical condition. Previously, it was shown that
multiplication constraints ($x \cdot y = z$), squaring constraints ($x^2 = y$),
or inversion constraints ($x\cdot y = 1$) are sufficient to establish
ER-completeness. We extend this in the strongest possible sense for equality
constraints as follows. We show that CCSPs (with addition constraints and some
other mild technical condition) that have any one well-behaved curved equality
constraint ($f(x,y) = 0$) are ER-complete. We further extend our results to
inequality constraints. We show that any well-behaved convexly curved and any
well-behaved concavely curved inequality constraint ($f(x,y) \geq 0$ and
$g(x,y) \geq 0$) imply ER-completeness on the class of such CCSPs.

$\mathbb{Z}^2$ are linear combinations of the extremal measures obtained as
thermodynamic limits under free or monochromatic boundary conditions. In
particular all Gibbs measures are invariant under translations. This statement
is new at points of first-order phase transition, that is at $T=T_{c}(q)$ when
$q>4$. In this case the structure of Gibbs measures is the most complex in the
sense that there exist $q+1$ distinct extremal measures.
  Most of the work is devoted to the FK-percolation model on $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$
with $q\geq 1$, where we prove that every Gibbs measure is a linear combination
of the free and wired ones. The arguments are non-quantitative and follow the
spirit of the seminal works of Aizenman and Higuchi, which established the
Gibbs structure for the two-dimensional Ising model. Infinite-range
dependencies in FK-percolation (i.e., a weaker spatial Markov property) pose
serious additional difficulties compared to the case of the Ising model. For
example, it is not automatic, albeit true, that thermodynamic limits are Gibbs.
The result for the Potts model is then derived using the Edwards-Sokal coupling
and auto-duality. The latter ingredient is necessary since applying the
Edwards-Sokal procedure to a Gibbs measure for the Potts model does not
automatically produce a Gibbs measure for FK-percolation.
  Finally, the proof is generic enough to adapt to the FK-percolation and Potts
models on the triangular and hexagonal lattices and to the loop $O(n)$ model in
the range of parameters for which its spin representation is positively
associated.

the number of dynamically relevant variables. We show that nonlinear
correlations in the temporal POD coefficients can be exploited to identify the
underlying attractor, characterized by a minimal set of driving modes and a
manifold equation for the remaining modes. By viewing these nonlinear
correlations as an invariant manifold reduction, this least-order
representation can be used to stabilize POD-Galerkin models or as a state space
for data-driven model identification. In the latter case, we use sparse
polynomial regression to learn a compact, interpretable dynamical system model
from the time series of the active modal coefficients. We demonstrate this

rings with internal elasticity. We monitor the dynamical behavior of the rings
as a function of the packing fraction, to address the effects of particle
deformation on the collective response of the system. In particular, we compare
three different models: (i) a recently investigated model [Gnan \& Zaccarelli,
Nat. Phys. 15, 683 (2019)], where an inner hertzian field providing the
internal elasticity acts on the monomers of the ring, (ii) the same model where
the effect of such a field on the center of mass is balanced by opposite forces
and (iii) a semi-flexible model where an angular potential between adjacent
monomers induces strong particle deformations. By analyzing the dynamics of the
three models, we find that, in all cases, there exists a direct link between
the system fragility and particle asphericity. Among the three, only the first
model displays anomalous dynamics in the form of a super-diffusive behavior of
the mean squared displacement and of a compressed exponential relaxation of the
density auto-correlation function. We show that this is due to the combination
of internal elasticity and the out-of-equilibrium force self-generated by each
ring, both of which are necessary ingredients to induce such peculiar behavior
often observed in experiments of colloidal gels. These findings reinforce the
role of particle deformation, connected to internal elasticity, in driving the
dynamical response of dense soft particles.

waves, leading to the recoil of the merger remnant. Black-hole kicks have
attracted much attention because of their astrophysical implications. However,
little information can be extracted from the observations made by LIGO and
Virgo so far. In this work, we discuss how the gravitational recoil, an effect
that is encoded in the gravitational signal, can be used to test the accuracy
of waveform models. Gravitational-wave models of merging binary systems have
become fundamental to detect potential signals and infer the parameters of
observed sources. But, as the interferometers' sensitivity is enhanced in
current and future detectors, gravitational waveform models will have to be
further improved. We find that the kick is highly sensitive to waveform
inaccuracies and can therefore be a useful diagnostic test. Furthermore, we
observe that current higher-mode waveform models are not consistent in their
kick predictions. For this reason, we discuss whether measuring and improving
waveform accuracy can, in turn, allow us to extract meaningful information
about the kick in future observations.

Due to dependency on the past, standard algorithms for training these models,

inconsistency between inference and training. This paper shows that recurrent
neural networks can be reformulated as fixed-points of non-linear equation

exactly and in as many iterations as the length of any given sequence. Each
iteration of this algorithm adds one additional Markovian-like order of

recurrent neural networks have been incorporated. Although exact fixed-points
inherit the same parallelization and inconsistency issues, this paper shows
that approximate fixed-points can be computed in parallel and used consistently

Experimental validation is performed in two tasks, Penn Tree Bank and

mechanism of the ""unexpected"" bulk SOTs by studying their dependence on the
introduction of a controlled vertical composition gradient and on temperature.
We find that the bulk damping like SOT arises from an imbalanced internal spin
current that is transversely polarized and independent of the magnetization
orientation. The torque can be strong only in the presence of a vertical
composition gradient and the SOT efficiency per electric field is insensitive
to temperature but changes sign upon reversal of the orientation of the
composition gradient, which are in analogue to behaviors of the strain. From
these characteristics we conclude that the imbalanced internal spin current
originates from a bulk spin Hall effect and that the associated inversion
asymmetry that allows for a non-zero net torque is most likely a strain
non-uniformity induced by the composition gradient. The fieldlike SOT is a
relatively small bulk effect compared to the dampinglike SOT. This work points
to the possibility of developing low-power single-layer SOT devices by strain
engineering.

  Results. We detected H$_2$S emission in four sources out of the nine

momentum space, with the computed anti-symmetric profile around four orders of
magnitude smaller than the total profile. The difference signal that we measure
is consistent with the computed profile, but of the same order of magnitude as
the statistical errors and systematic uncertainties of the experiment. Our
results motivate further theoretical work to understand the factors that
influence the size of the anti-symmetric Compton profile, and to identify
materials exhibiting larger effects.

pre-trained models such as BERT are challenged by deploying on
resource-constraint devices. Most existing model compression approaches require
re-compression or fine-tuning across diverse constraints to accommodate various
hardware deployments. This practically limits the further application of model
compression. Moreover, the ineffective training and searching process of
existing elastic compression paradigms[4,27] prevents the direct migration to
BERT compression. Motivated by the necessity of efficient inference across
various constraints on BERT, we propose a novel approach, YOCO-BERT, to achieve
compress once and deploy everywhere. Specifically, we first construct a huge
search space with 10^13 architectures, which covers nearly all configurations
in BERT model. Then, we propose a novel stochastic nature gradient optimization
method to guide the generation of optimal candidate architecture which could
keep a balanced trade-off between explorations and exploitation. When a certain
resource constraint is given, a lightweight distribution optimization approach
is utilized to obtain the optimal network for target deployment without
fine-tuning. Compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, YOCO-BERT provides more
compact models, yet achieving 2.1%-4.5% average accuracy improvement on the
GLUE benchmark. Besides, YOCO-BERT is also more effective, e.g.,the training

  Dominating Sets in Trees","Accepted at PODC 2021",,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, Balliu, Brandt, and Olivetti [FOCS '20] showed the first
$\omega(\log^* n)$ lower bound for the maximal independent set (MIS) problem in
trees. In this work we prove lower bounds for a much more relaxed family of
distributed symmetry breaking problems. As a by-product, we obtain improved
lower bounds for the distributed MIS problem in trees.
  For a parameter $k$ and an orientation of the edges of a graph $G$, we say
that a subset $S$ of the nodes of $G$ is a $k$-outdegree dominating set if $S$
is a dominating set of $G$ and if in the induced subgraph $G[S]$, every node in
$S$ has outdegree at most $k$. Note that for $k=0$, this definition coincides
with the definition of an MIS. For a given $k$, we consider the problem of
computing a $k$-outdegree dominating set. We show that, even in regular trees
of degree at most $\Delta$, in the standard \LOCAL model, there exists a
constant $\epsilon>0$ such that for $k\leq \Delta^\epsilon$, for the problem of
computing a $k$-outdegree dominating set, any randomized algorithm requires at
least $\Omega(\min\{\log\Delta,\sqrt{\log\log n}\})$ rounds and any
deterministic algorithm requires at least $\Omega(\min\{\log\Delta,\sqrt{\log
n}\})$ rounds.
  The proof of our lower bounds is based on the recently highly successful
round elimination technique. We provide a novel way to do simplifications for
round elimination, which we expect to be of independent interest. Our new proof
is considerably simpler than the lower bound proof in [FOCS '20]. In
particular, our round elimination proof uses a family of problems that can be
described by only a constant number of labels. The existence of such a proof
for the MIS problem was believed impossible by the authors of [FOCS '20].

experimental sequence libraries. To be detectable, these signals require
sufficiently large and sufficiently diverged libraries. Our modeling framework
offers a quantitative explanation for the variable success of recently

resource-intensive evolution experiments, opening thereby a way to
computationally optimize experimental protocols.

an isoperimetric problem in which the standard perimeter $P(E)$ is replaced by
$P(E)-\gamma P_\varepsilon(E)$, with $0<\gamma<1$ and $P_\varepsilon$ a
nonlocal energy such that $P_\varepsilon(E)\to P(E)$ as $\varepsilon$ vanishes.
We prove that unit area minimizers are disks for $\varepsilon>0$ small enough.
More precisely, we first show that in dimension $2$, minimizers are necessarily
convex, provided that $\varepsilon$ is small enough. In turn, this implies that
minimizers have nearly circular boundaries, that is, their boundary is a small
Lipschitz perturbation of the circle. Then, using a Fuglede-type argument, we
prove that (in arbitrary dimension $n\geq 2$) the unit ball in $\mathbb{R}^n$
is the unique unit-volume minimizer of the problem among centered nearly
spherical sets. As a consequence, up to translations, the unit disk is the
unique minimizer. This isoperimetric problem is equivalent to a generalization
of the liquid drop model for the atomic nucleus introduced by Gamow, where the
nonlocal repulsive potential is given by a radial, sufficiently integrable
kernel. In that formulation, our main result states that if the first moment of
the kernel is smaller than an explicit threshold, there exists a critical mass
$m_0$ such that for any $m>m_0$, the disk is the unique minimizer of area $m$
up to translations. This is in sharp contrast with the usual case of Riesz
kernels, where the problem does not admit minimizers above a critical mass.

certain amounts of flexibility always exist. This includes the choice of data

the way the performance values are aggregated over the data sets. As a
consequence of this flexibility, researchers may be concerned about how their
choices affect the results or, in the worst case, may be tempted to engage in
questionable research practices (e.g. the selective reporting of results or the
post-hoc modification of design or analysis components) to fit their

benchmark study to illustrate how variable benchmark results can be when all
possible combinations of a range of design and analysis options are considered.
We then demonstrate how the impact of each choice on the results can be
assessed using multidimensional unfolding. In conclusion, based on previous
literature and on our illustrative example, we claim that the multiplicity of
design and analysis options combined with questionable research practices lead
to biased interpretations of benchmark results and to over-optimistic
conclusions. This issue should be considered by computational researchers when

both the optical and the near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams revealed that
the extinction coefficient R$_V$ in the direction of Liller 1 has a much
smaller value than commonly assumed for diffuse interstellar medium (R$_V=2.5$,
instead of 3.1), in agreement with previous findings along different light
paths to the Galactic bulge. The derived differential reddening map has a
spatial resolution ranging from $1''$ to $3''$ over a field of view of about
$90''$X$90''$. We found that the absorption clouds show patchy sub-structures
with extinction variations as large as $\delta {\rm E}(B-V)\sim0.9$ mag.

of the technical challenges. In the past, numerous research have been done on
the optimization of trajectory planning of berthing problems. However, these
studies assumed only a simple berth and did not consider obstacles.
Optimization of trajectory planning on berthing and unberthing in actual ports
must consider the spatial constraints and maintain sufficient distance to
obstacles. The main contributions of this study are as follows: (i) a collision
avoidance algorithm based on the ship domain which has variable size by the
ship speed is proposed, to include the spatial constraints to optimization;
(ii) the effect of wind disturbance is taken into account to the trajectory
planning to make a feasible trajectory based on the capacity limit of
actuators; (iii) showing that the optimization method for berthing is also
eligible for the unberthing, which has been almost neglected; (iv) waypoints
are included to the optimization process, to make optimization easier on
practical applications. The authors tested the proposed method on two existing
ports. The proposed method performed well on both the berthing and the
unberthing problem and optimized the control input and the trajectory while
avoiding collision with the complex obstacles.

common cancer globally, and early detection of gastric cancer is essential to
save lives. Histopathological examination of gastric cancer is the gold
standard for the diagnosis of gastric cancer. However, computer-aided
diagnostic techniques are challenging to evaluate due to the scarcity of
publicly available gastric histopathology image datasets. Methods: In this
paper, a noble publicly available Gastric Histopathology Sub-size Image
Database (GasHisSDB) is published to identify classifiers' performance.
Specifically, two types of data are included: normal and abnormal, with a total
of 245,196 tissue case images. In order to prove that the methods of different
periods in the field of image classification have discrepancies on GasHisSDB,
we select a variety of classifiers for evaluation. Seven classical machine
learning classifiers, three Convolutional Neural Network classifiers, and a
novel transformer-based classifier are selected for testing on image
classification tasks. Results: This study performed extensive experiments using
traditional machine learning and deep learning methods to prove that the
methods of different periods have discrepancies on GasHisSDB. Traditional
machine learning achieved the best accuracy rate of 86.08% and a minimum of
just 41.12%. The best accuracy of deep learning reached 96.47% and the lowest
was 86.21%. Accuracy rates vary significantly across classifiers. Conclusions:
To the best of our knowledge, it is the first publicly available gastric cancer
histopathology dataset containing a large number of images for weakly
supervised learning. We believe that GasHisSDB can attract researchers to
explore new algorithms for the automated diagnosis of gastric cancer, which can
help physicians and patients in the clinical setting.

Kretschmann scalar, and squared Ricci tensor to improve the field equations by
turning the Newton constant into a running coupling constant. For all the
cases, we check the radial energy conditions of the wormhole solution and
compare them with those valid in General Relativity (GR). We verify that
asymptotic safety guarantees that the Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole can satisfy the
radial energy conditions at the throat radius, $r_0$, within an interval of
values of this latter. That is quite different from the result found in GR.
Following, we evaluate the effective radial state parameter, $\omega(r)$, at
$r_0$, showing that the quantum gravitational effects modify Einstein's field
equations in such a way that it is necessary a very exotic source of matter to
generate the wormhole spacetime -- phantom or quintessence-like. That occurs
within some ranges of throat radii, even though the energy conditions are or
not violated there. Finally, we find that, although at $r_0$ we have a
quintessence-like matter, on growing of $r$ we necessarily come across
phantom-like regions. We speculate if such a phantom fluid must always be
present in wormholes in the ASG context or even in more general quantum gravity

Extraordinary non-Hermitian phenomena, ranging from the non-Hermitian skin

duality between non-Hermitian models in flat spaces and their counterparts,

one-dimensional (1D) chains with uniform chiral tunnelings are equivalent to
their duals in two-dimensional (2D) hyperbolic spaces with or without magnetic
fields, and non-uniform tunnelings could further tailor local curvatures. Such
a duality unfolds deep geometric roots of non-Hermitian phenomena, delivers an
unprecedented routine connecting Hermitian and non-Hermitian physics, and gives
rise to a theoretical perspective reformulating our understandings of
curvatures and distance. In practice, it provides experimentalists with a
powerful two-fold application, using non-Hermiticity as a new protocol to

Using the state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulation eagle, we
work out the chemical inhomogeneities arising in the disk of galaxies due to
the randomness of the accretion process. In low-mass systems and outskirts of
massive galaxies, low metallicity regions are associated with enhanced
star-formation, a trend that reverses in the centers of massive galaxies. These
predictions agree with the relation between surface density of star formation
rate and metallicity observed in the local spiral galaxies from the MaNGA
survey. Then, we analyse the origin of the gas that produces stars at two key
epochs, z simeq 0 and z simeq 2. The main contribution comes from gas already
in the galaxy about 1 Gyr before stars are formed, with a share from external
gas that is larger at high redshift. The accreted gas may come from major and
minor mergers, but also as gravitationally unbound gas and from mergers with
dark galaxies (i.e., haloes where more than 95 % of the baryon mass is in gas).
We give the relative contribution of these sources of gas as a function of

significant fraction of their total stellar mass during the last Gyr from

the simulation of the ductile damage. The model couples the phase field method
of fracture to the Armstrong-Frederick plasticity model with kinematic
hardening. The latter is particularly suitable for simulating the material
behavior under a cyclic load. The model relies on the minimum principle of the
dissipation potential. However, the application of this approach is challenging
since potentials of coupled methods are defined in different spaces: The
dissipation potential of the phase field model is expressed in terms of rates
of internal variables, whereas the Armstrong-Frederick model proposes a
formulation depending on thermodynamic forces. For this reason, a unique
formulation requires the Legendre transformation of one of the potentials. The
present work performs the transformation of the Armstrong-Frederick potential,
such that final formulation is only expressed in the space of rates of internal
variables. With the assumption for the free energy and the joint dissipation
potential at hand, the derivation of evolution equations is straightforward.
The application of the model is illustrated by selected numerical examples
studying the material response for different load constellations and sample
geometries. The paper provides a comparison with the experimental results as
well.

how the relationship between two variables may be direct or indirect via a

lack of closed form calculations and the need for substantial amounts of
computational simulations. The current work provides a detailed explanation of
implementing large scale simulation procedures within a shared computing
cluster environment. In addition, all results and code for implementing these
procedures is publicly available. The resulting power analyses compare the
effects of sample size and strength and direction of the relationships between
the three variables. Comparisons of three confidence interval calculation
methods demonstrated that the bias-corrected method is optimal and requires
approximately ten less participants than the percentile method to achieve
equivalent power. Differing strengths of distal and proximal effects were
compared and did not differentially affect the power to detect mediation
effects. Suppression effects were explored and demonstrate that in the presence
of no observed relationship between two variables, entrance of the mediating
variable into the model can reveal a suppressed relationship. The power to
detect suppression effects is similar to unsuppressed mediation. These results
and their methods provide important information about the power of mediation
models for study planning. Of greater importance is that the methods lay the
groundwork for assessment of statistical power of more complicated models

privacy and modeling utility. We propose NeuraCrypt, a private encoding scheme
based on random deep neural networks. NeuraCrypt encodes raw patient data using
a randomly constructed neural network known only to the data-owner, and
publishes both the encoded data and associated labels publicly. From a
theoretical perspective, we demonstrate that sampling from a sufficiently rich

privacy against a computationally unbounded adversary with full knowledge of
the underlying data-distribution. We propose to approximate this family of
encoding functions through random deep neural networks. Empirically, we
demonstrate the robustness of our encoding to a suite of adversarial attacks

Here, we explore the critical parameters in the growth of high quality
nickelate films using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). We found that stoichiometry
is crucial in optimizing the crystalline structure and realizing
superconductivity in nickelate films. In precursor NdNiO3 films, optimal
stoichiometry of cations yields the most compact lattice while
off-stoichiometry of cations causes obvious lattice expansion, influencing the
subsequent topotactic reduction and the emergence of superconductivity in
infinite-layer nickelates. Surprisingly, in-situ reflection high energy

deserve further studies. Our work demonstrates and highlights the significance

three-dimensional lattice gauge theories with scalar fields. We study this

symmetry only selects the gauge-invariant scalar degrees of freedom that become
critical. A paradigmatic model in which this behavior is realized is the
lattice CP(1) model or, more generally, the lattice Abelian-Higgs model with
two-component complex scalar fields and compact gauge fields. We consider this
model in the presence of a linear GSB perturbation. The gauge symmetry turns
out to be quite robust with respect to the GSB perturbation: the continuum
limit is gauge-invariant also in the presence of a finite small GSB term. We
also determine the phase diagram of the model. It has one disordered phase and
two phases that are tensor and vector ordered, respectively. They are separated
by continuous transition lines, which belong to the O(3), O(4), and O(2) vector
universality classes, and which meet at a multicritical point. We remark that
the behavior at the CP(1) gauge-symmetric critical point substantially differs
from that at transitions in which gauge correlations become critical, for
instance at transitions in the noncompact lattice Abelian-Higgs model that are
controlled by the charged fixed point: in this case the behavior is extremely
sensitive to GSB perturbations.

their structure. The modern economy is additionally characterized by private
debt. The Human and Resources with MONEY (HARMONEY) economic growth model links
these features using a stock and flow consistent framework in physical and
monetary units. Via an updated version, we explore the interdependence of
growth and three major structural metrics of an economy. First, we show that
relative decoupling of gross domestic product (GDP) from resource consumption
is an expected pattern that occurs because of physical limits to growth, not a
response to avoid physical limits. While an increase in resource efficiency of
operating capital does increase the level of relative decoupling, so does a
change in pricing from one based on full costs to one based only on marginal
costs that neglects depreciation and interest payments leading to higher debt
ratios. Second, if assuming full labor bargaining power for wages, when a
previously-growing economy reaches peak resource extraction and GDP, wages
remain high but profits and debt decline to zero. By removing bargaining power,
profits can remain positive at the expense of declining wages. Third, the
distribution of intermediate transactions within the input-output table of the
model follows the same temporal pattern as in the post-World War II U.S.
economy. These results indicate that the HARMONEY framework enables realistic
investigation of interdependent structural change and trade-offs between
economic distribution, size, and resources consumption.

during acceleration, though the adiabatic condition is still met during this

of the emittance during acceleration. The recent machine study in the

patients discharged from an inpatient hospital setting, and improved
information sharing can help. To share information, caregivers write discharge
notes containing action items to share with patients and their future
caregivers, but these action items are easily lost due to the lengthiness of
the documents. In this work, we describe our creation of a dataset of clinical
action items annotated over MIMIC-III, the largest publicly available dataset
of real clinical notes. This dataset, which we call CLIP, is annotated by
physicians and covers 718 documents representing 100K sentences. We describe
the task of extracting the action items from these documents as multi-aspect
extractive summarization, with each aspect representing a type of action to be
taken. We evaluate several machine learning models on this task, and show that
the best models exploit in-domain language model pre-training on 59K
unannotated documents, and incorporate context from neighboring sentences. We
also propose an approach to pre-training data selection that allows us to
explore the trade-off between size and domain-specificity of pre-training
datasets for this task.

density grows as mDM^{2}, the NSC (dominant stellar component within about 3
pc) is sensitive to a specific window in the dark matter particle mass, mDM. We
apply a spherical isotropic Jeans model to fit the NSC line-of-sight velocity

Nowadays, we have seen a lot of sensor-rich vehicles (e.g. Robo-taxi) driving
on the street autonomously, which rely on high-accurate sensors (e.g. Lidar and
RTK GPS) and high-resolution map. However, low-cost production cars cannot
afford such high expenses on sensors and maps. How to reduce costs? How do
sensor-rich vehicles benefit low-cost cars? In this paper, we proposed a
light-weight localization solution, which relies on low-cost cameras and
compact visual semantic maps. The map is easily produced and updated by
sensor-rich vehicles in a crowd-sourced way. Specifically, the map consists of
several semantic elements, such as lane line, crosswalk, ground sign, and stop
line on the road surface. We introduce the whole framework of on-vehicle
mapping, on-cloud maintenance, and user-end localization. The map data is
collected and preprocessed on vehicles. Then, the crowd-sourced data is
uploaded to a cloud server. The mass data from multiple vehicles are merged on
the cloud so that the semantic map is updated in time. Finally, the semantic
map is compressed and distributed to production cars, which use this map for
localization. We validate the performance of the proposed map in real-world
experiments and compare it against other algorithms. The average size of the
semantic map is $36$ kb/km. We highlight that this framework is a reliable and
practical localization solution for autonomous driving.

property if the timelike future of any point on $\mathcal{I}^-$ contains the
whole of $\mathcal{I}^+$. This property was first discussed for asymptotically
flat spacetimes by Penrose, along with an equivalent definition (the finite
version). In this paper we consider the Penrose property in greater generality.
In particular we consider spacetimes with a non-zero cosmological constant and
we note that the two versions of the property are no longer equivalent. In
asymptotically AdS spacetimes it is necessary to re-state the property in a way
which is more suited to spacetimes with a timelike boundary. We arrive at a
property previously considered by Gao and Wald. Curiously, this property was
shown to fail in spacetimes which focus null geodesics. This is in contrast to
our findings in asymptotically flat and asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes. We
then move on to consider some further example spacetimes (with zero
cosmological constant) which highlight features of the Penrose property not
previously considered. We discuss spacetimes which are the product of a
Lorentzian and a compact Riemannian manifold. Perhaps surprisingly, we find
that both versions of the Penrose property are satisfied in this product
spacetime if and only if they are satisfied in the Lorentzian spacetime only.
We also discuss the Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole (an example of a spacetime with
more than one asymptotically flat end) and the Hayward metric (an example of a
non-singular black hole spacetime).

re-design or re-learning when the number or the position of the users change.
In contrast, transferability allows to apply a single user association policy,
devised for a specific scenario, to other distinct user deployments, without
needing a substantial re-learning or re-design phase and considerably reducing
its computational and management complexity. To achieve transferability, we
first cast user association as a multi-agent reinforcement learning problem.

this context, we propose a novel distributed policy network architecture, which
is transferable among users with zero-shot generalization capability i.e.,

fraction of the time. However, few previous works have used NNs to model the
numerical solver itself. For the express purpose of accelerating time domain
simulation speeds, this paper proposes and explores two complementary
alternatives for modeling numerical solvers. First, we use a NN to mimic the
linear transformation provided by the inverse Jacobian in a single Newton step.
Using this procedure, we evaluate and project the exact, physics-based residual
error onto the NN mapping, thus leaving physics ``in the loop''. The resulting
tool, termed the Physics-pRojected Neural-Newton Solver (PRoNNS), is able to
achieve an extremely high degree of numerical accuracy at speeds which were
observed to be up to 31% faster than a Newton-based solver. In the second
approach, we model the Newton solver at the heart of an implicit Runge-Kutta
integrator as a contracting map iteratively seeking a fixed point on a time
domain trajectory. The associated recurrent NN simulation tool, termed the
Contracting Neural-Newton Solver (CoNNS), is embedded with training constraints
(via CVXPY Layers) which guarantee the mapping provided by the NN satisfies the
Banach fixed-point theorem.

devise and develop ranking-based recommender systems. Most methods following
this approach aim at optimizing the same metric being used for evaluation,
under the assumption that this will lead to the best performance. A number of
studies of this practice bring this assumption, however, into question. In this
paper, we dig deeper into this issue in order to learn more about the effects
of the choice of the metric to optimize on the performance of a ranking-based
recommender system. We present an extensive experimental study conducted on
different datasets in both pairwise and listwise learning-to-rank scenarios, to
compare the relative merit of four popular IR metrics, namely RR, AP, nDCG and
RBP, when used for optimization and assessment of recommender systems in
various combinations. For the first three, we follow the practice of loss
function formulation available in literature. For the fourth one, we propose
novel loss functions inspired by RBP for both the pairwise and listwise
scenario. Our results confirm that the best performance is indeed not
necessarily achieved when optimizing the same metric being used for evaluation.
In fact, we find that RBP-inspired losses perform at least as well as other
metrics in a consistent way, and offer clear benefits in several cases.
Interesting to see is that RBP-inspired losses, while improving the
recommendation performance for all uses, may lead to an individual performance
gain that is correlated with the activity level of a user in interacting with
items. The more active the users, the more they benefit. Overall, our results
challenge the assumption behind the current research practice of optimizing and
evaluating the same metric, and point to RBP-based optimization instead as a
promising alternative when learning to rank in the recommendation context.

socio-economic phenomena such as the spread of innovations or the adoption of
products on social networks. The common trait of these systems is the
occurrence of large-scale coordination events taking place abruptly, in the
form of a cascade process, as a consequence of small perturbations of an
apparently stable state. The conditions for the occurrence of cascade
instabilities have been largely analysed in the literature, however for the
same coordination models no sufficient attention was given to the relation
between structural properties of (Nash) equilibria and possible outcomes of
dynamical equilibrium selection. Using methods from the statistical physics of
disordered systems, the present work investigates both analytically and
numerically, the statistical properties of such Nash equilibria on networks,
focusing mostly on random graphs. We provide an accurate description of these
properties, which is then exploited to shed light on the mechanisms behind the
onset of coordination/miscoordination on large networks. This is done studying
the most common processes of dynamical equilibrium selection, such as best
response, bounded-rational dynamics and learning processes. In particular, we
show that well beyond the instability region, full coordination is still
globally stochastically stable, however equilibrium selection processes with
low stochasticity (e.g. best response) or strong memory effects (e.g.
reinforcement learning) can be prevented from achieving full coordination by
being trapped into a large (exponentially in number of agents) set of locally
stable Nash equilibria at low/medium coordination (inefficient equilibria).
These results should be useful to allow a better understanding of general
coordination problems on complex networks.

formulas (DQBF) that uses interpolation-based definition extraction to compute
Skolem functions in a counter-example guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) loop.
In each iteration, a family of candidate Skolem functions is tested for
correctness using a SAT solver, which either determines that a model has been
found, or returns an assignment of the universal variables as a counterexample.
Fixing a counterexample generally involves changing candidates of multiple
existential variables with incomparable dependency sets. Our procedure
introduces auxiliary variables -- which we call arbiter variables -- that each
represent the value of an existential variable for a particular assignment of
its dependency set. Possible repairs are expressed as clauses on these
variables, and a SAT solver is invoked to find an assignment that deals with
all previously seen counterexamples. Adding arbiter variables defines the
values of Skolem functions for assignments where they were previously
undefined, and may lead to the detection of Skolem functions by definition
extraction in subsequent iterations. A key feature of the proposed procedure is
that it is certifying by design: for true DQBF, models can be returned at
minimal overhead. Towards certification of false formulas, we prove that
clauses can be derived in an expansion-based proof system for DQBF. In an
experimental evaluation on standard benchmark sets, an implementation was able
to match (and in some cases, surpass) the performance of state-of-the-art DQBF

reward, but it comes at the cost of short-term 'regret'. We study how this cost
of exploration is shared across multiple groups. For example, in a clinical
trial setting, patients who are assigned a sub-optimal treatment effectively
incur the cost of exploration. When patients are associated with natural groups
on the basis of, say, race or age, it is natural to ask whether the cost of
exploration borne by any single group is 'fair'. So motivated, we introduce the
'grouped' bandit model. We leverage the theory of axiomatic bargaining, and the
Nash bargaining solution in particular, to formalize what might constitute a
fair division of the cost of exploration across groups. On the one hand, we
show that any regret-optimal policy strikingly results in the least fair
outcome: such policies will perversely leverage the most 'disadvantaged' groups
when they can. More constructively, we derive policies that are optimally fair

layers and a dynamic phrase-layer. LSTM cells and two boundary detectors are
used to implement the proposed structure, and the resulting network is called
the {\em Recurrent Neural Network with Mixed Hierarchical Structures}
(MHS-RNN). We further add three layers of attention mechanisms to the MHS-RNN
model. Incorporating attention mechanisms allows our model to use more
important content to construct document representation and enhance its
performance on document classification tasks. Experiments on five different
datasets show that the proposed architecture outperforms previous methods on
all the five tasks.

  calculations and symmetry group representation analysis",,,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dirac points are found to emerge due to the crossing of bands in the
electronic structure of bilayer graphene for configurations in which the
alignment between two hexagonal lattices preserves the parallelism of the
armchair/zigzag lines between two layers. On the base of electronic
calculations using a tight-binding model for the $\pi$ bands it is shown that
the crossing of the energy-band dispersion curves occurs in the vicinity of the
corner points of the hexagonal Brillouin zone. Group representation theory
analysis confirms the emergence of such Dirac points. It is demonstrated that
the band crossings at generic $\mathbf{k}$ points are guaranteed by the
compatibility relations between the symmetries of eigenstates at the
high-symmetry $\mathbf{k}$ points in the Brillouin zone. The presence of Dirac
points governs the geometrical properties of the energy surfaces, and thus the
topological structure of the Fermi energy surface and the energy spectrum.

in $W^*$ which vanish on a nontrivial Poisson ideal (that is, the only maximal

on the interpretability of attention distributions. Although it provides
insights about how a model is operating, utilizing attention as the explanation

more interpretable strategies for better identifying local active regions that
contribute the most to the final decision. To improve the interpretability of
existing attention models, we propose a novel Bilinear Representative
Non-Parametric Attention (BR-NPA) strategy that captures the task-relevant
human-interpretable information. The target model is first distilled to have
higher-resolution intermediate feature maps. From which, representative
features are then grouped based on local pairwise feature similarity, to
produce finer-grained, more precise attention maps highlighting task-relevant
parts of the input. The obtained attention maps are ranked according to the
activity level of the compound feature, which provides information regarding
the important level of the highlighted regions. The proposed model can be
easily adapted in a wide variety of modern deep models, where classification is
involved. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments showcase more
comprehensive and accurate visual explanations compared to state-of-the-art
attention models and visualizations methods across multiple tasks including
fine-grained image classification, few-shot classification, and person
re-identification, without compromising the classification accuracy. The
proposed visualization model sheds imperative light on how neural networks `pay

whitening the activations iteratively using Newton's method. However, since
Newton's method initializes the whitening matrix independently at each training
step, no information is shared between consecutive steps. In this work, instead
of exact computation of whitening matrix at each time step, we estimate it
gradually during training in an online fashion, using our proposed Stochastic
Whitening Batch Normalization (SWBN) algorithm. We show that while SWBN
improves the convergence rate and generalization of DNNs, its computational
overhead is less than that of IterNorm. Due to the high efficiency of the

of work develops fair training methods that can function without any

fair training algorithms which exhibit both good utility, and low bias. In

elliptical or eventually become spherical. Mainly the latter question was
addressed in a previous publication which identified frictional sliding and
rotation of an elliptic pebble as main abrasion processes in the surf waves. In
particular, it was predicted that the ellipticity $\epsilon$ converges to a
common equilibrium value for elliptic-like pebbles. Unfortunately, the
derivation was based on an invalid force expression and a dimensionally
unsuitable curvature. In this paper, not only force and curvature but also the
contact duration with the sand surface during rotations is taken into account
by fairly simple physical arguments, and it is shown that elliptic pebbles
neither approach the same ellipticity and nor become more spherical nor more

Besides, in order to alleviate the inconsistency issue of the posterior between
training and predicting as well as improving the mining of dynamic patterns, we
(i) propose using a lagged hybrid output as input for the posterior at next
time step, which brings training and predicting into alignment; and (ii)
further devise a generalized auto-regressive strategy that encodes all the
historical dependencies for the posterior. Thereafter, we first investigate the
methodological characteristics of the proposed deep probabilistic sequence
model on toy cases, and then comprehensively demonstrate the superiority of our
model against existing deep probabilistic SSM models through extensive
numerical experiments on eight system identification benchmarks from various
dynamic systems. Finally, we apply our sequence model to a real-world
centrifugal compressor forecasting problem, and again verify its outstanding
performance by quantifying the time series predictive distribution.

presents experiment results and empirical observations to further explore this
issue. The objective is to study the effects of data transformation on geozone
classification performance when machine learning (ML) classifiers/estimators
are trained using geochemical data. The training input consists of exploration
hole assay samples obtained from a Pilbara iron-ore deposit in Western
Australia, and geozone labels assigned based on stratigraphic units, the
absence or presence and type of mineralization. The ML techniques considered
are multinomial logistic regression, Gaussian na\""{i}ve Bayes, kNN, linear
support vector classifier, RBF-SVM, gradient boosting and extreme GB, random
forest (RF) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The transformations examined
include isometric log-ratio (ILR), center log-ratio (CLR) coupled with
principal component analysis (PCA) or independent component analysis (ICA), and
a manifold learning approach based on local linear embedding (LLE). The results
reveal that different ML classifiers exhibit varying sensitivity to these
transformations, with some clearly more advantageous or deleterious than
others. Overall, the best performing candidate is ILR which is unsurprising
considering the compositional nature of the data. The performance of pairwise
log-ratio (PWLR) transformation is better than ILR for ensemble and tree-based
learners such as boosting and RF; but worse for MLP, SVM and other classifiers.

action in the advertising chain. The usual approach is to take a certain action
as the objective, and introduce multiple independent Two-Tower models to
predict the possibility of users' action on tags (known as CTR or CVR
prediction). The predicted users' high probably attractive tags are to
represent their preferences. However, the single-action models cannot learn
complementarily and support effective training on data-sparse actions. Besides,
limited by the lack of information fusion between the two towers, the model
learns insufficiently to represent users' preferences on various tag

considered too difficult to be included in standard physics studies at bachelor
and master level, can now be introduced even for second year bachelor students
and up. In the original Hanbury Brown and Twiss effect the angular size of the
source (the star Sirius) was calculated by determining the distance between two
detectors that lead to a drop in the cross-correlations in the signals from the
detectors. We find that this principle works equally well by sound waves from a
waterfall. This is remarkable, since we use a completely different kind of
waves from the HBT case, the frequency of the waves differ by a factor $\sim
10^{12}$ and the wavelength as well as the angular extension of the source seen
from the observer's position differ by a factor $\sim 10^{7}$. The original HBT
papers were based on measurements of \emph{intensity} fluctuations recorded by
two detectors and correlations between these signals. The starting point for
the theory that explained the effect was therefore intensity fluctuations per
see, and the theory is not easy to understand, at least not for an
undergraduate physics student. Our starting point is descriptions of broadband
waves at the amplitude level (not at intensity level) by numerical modeling.
Important properties of broadband waves can easily be revealed and understood
by numerical modeling, and time-resolved frequency analysis (TFA) based on
Morlet wavelets turns out to be a very useful tool. In fact, we think it has
been far too little attention to broadband waves in physics education hitherto,

TPV system obtained by the genetic algorithm achieves the electrical power
output of 8.41 W/cm$^2$ and the conversion efficiency of 35.6\% at the vacuum

the optimized system. We also show that the near-field tandem TPV system is

optimization performed with the objective function of the conversion efficiency
leads to the current matching condition for the tandem TPV system regardless of

  reanalysis data",,,"10.1088/1748-9326/ac48b3",,"physics.ao-ph q-bio.QM stat.CO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Advances in climate science have rendered obsolete gridded observation data
sets commonly used in macroecological analyses. Novel climate reanalysis
products outperform legacy data products in accuracy, temporal resolution, and
provision of uncertainty metrics. Consequently, there is an urgent need to
develop a workflow through which to integrate these improved data into
analyses. The ERA5 product family are the latest and most advanced global
reanalysis products created by the ECMWF. These data products offer up to 83
essential climate variables at hourly intervals for the time-period of 1981 to
today with preliminary back-extensions being available for 1950-1981. Spatial
resolutions range from 30km (ERA5) to 11km (ERA5-Land) and can be statistically
downscaled to study-requirements at finer spatial resolutions. Kriging is one
such method to interpolate data to finer resolutions and has the advantages
that one can leverage additional covariate information and obtain the
uncertainty associated with the downscaling. The KrigR R Package enables users
to (1) download ERA5(-Land) climate reanalysis data for a user-specified
region, and time-period, (2) aggregate these climate products to desired
temporal resolutions and metrics, (3) acquire topographical co-variates, and
(4) statistically downscale spatial data to a user-specified resolution using
co-variate data via kriging. This R package provides a workflow for
implementation of state-of-the-art climate data into biological analyses while
avoiding issues of storage limitations at high temporal and spatial resolutions
by providing data according to user-needs rather than in global data sets.
Consequently, KrigR provides a toolbox to obtain a wide range of tailored
climate data at unprecedented combinations of high temporal and spatial
resolutions thus enabling the use of world-leading climate data in the
R-environment.

financial returns. In this paper we use a new nonparametric measure of local
dependence, the local Gaussian correlation, to improve portfolio allocation. We
extend the classical mean-variance framework, and show that the portfolio
optimization is straightforward using our new approach, only relying on a
tuning parameter (the bandwidth). The new method is shown to outperform the
equally weighted (1/N) portfolio and the classical Markowitz portfolio for
monthly asset returns data.

coronavirus ailment 2019 (COVID-19) is critical in the counteraction and
control of the COVID-19 flare-up. The new associated cases with COVID-19
information were gathered from 20 January 2020 to 21 July 2020. We filtered out
the countries which are converging and used those for training the network. We
utilized the SARIMAX, Linear regression model to anticipate new suspected
COVID-19 cases for the countries which did not converge yet. We predict the
curve of non-converged countries with the help of proposed Statistical SARIMAX
model (SSM). We present new information investigation-based forecast results
that can assist governments with planning their future activities and help
clinical administrations to be more ready for what's to come. Our framework can
foresee peak corona cases with an R-Squared value of 0.986 utilizing linear
regression and fall of this pandemic at various levels for countries like
India, US, and Brazil. We found that considering more countries for training
degrades the prediction process as constraints vary from nation to nation.
Thus, we expect that the outcomes referenced in this work will help individuals
to better understand the possibilities of this pandemic.

\ldots, t_h]= \{P_n^{\otimes h}\}_{n\geq 0},$ which is graded by the degree of
the homogeneous terms $P^{\otimes h}_n$ of degree $n$ in $h$ generators with
the degree of each $t_i$ being one, admits a left action of $\mathcal A$ as
well as a right action of the general linear group $GL_h.$ A central problem of
homotopy theory is to determine the structure of the space of
$GL_h$-coinvariants, $\mathbb Z/2\otimes_{GL_h}{\rm Ann}_{\overline{\mathcal
A}}[P^{\otimes h}_n]^{*}.$ Solving this problem is very difficult and still
open for $h\geq 4.$ In this Note, our intent is of studying the dimension of
$\mathbb Z/2\otimes_{GL_h}{\rm Ann}_{\overline{\mathcal A}}[P^{\otimes
h}_n]^{*}$ for the case $h = 4$ and the ""generic"" degrees $n$ of the form
$n_{k, r, s} = k(2^{s} - 1) + r.2^{s},$ where $k,\, r,\, s$ are positive
integers. Applying the results, we investigate the behaviour of the Singer
cohomological ""transfer"" of rank $4.$ Singer's transfer is a homomorphism from
a certain subquotient of the divided power algebra $\Gamma(a_1^{(1)}, \ldots,
a_h^{(1)})$ to mod-2 cohomology groups ${\rm Ext}_{\mathcal A}^{h, h+*}(\mathbb
Z/2, \mathbb Z/2)$ of the algebra $\mathcal A.$ This homomorphism is useful for
depicting the Ext groups. Additionally, in higher ranks, by using the results
on $\mathcal A$-generators for $P^{\otimes 5}$ and $P^{\otimes 6},$ we show in
Appendix that the transfer of rank 5 is an isomorphism in som certain degrees
of the form $n_{k, r, s}$, and that the transfer of rank 6 does not detect the
non-zero elements $h_2^{2}g_1 = h_4Ph_2\in {\rm Ext}_{\mathcal A}^{6, 6+n_{6,
10, 1}}(\mathbb Z/2, \mathbb Z/2)$, and $D_2\in {\rm Ext}_{\mathcal A}^{6,
6+n_{6, 10, 2}}(\mathbb Z/2, \mathbb Z/2).$ Besides, we also probe the behavior
of the Singer transfer of ranks 7 and 8 in internal degrees $\leq 15.$

microstructure is a fundamental problem in homogenization. In this work we
propose a graph convolutional neural network that utilizes the discretized
representation of the initial microstructure directly, without segmentation or
clustering. Compared to feature-based and pixel-based convolutional neural
network models, the proposed method has a number of advantages: (a) it is deep
in that it does not require featurization but can benefit from it, (b) it has a
simple implementation with standard convolutional filters and layers, (c) it
works natively on unstructured and structured grid data without interpolation
(unlike pixel-based convolutional neural networks), and (d) it preserves
rotational invariance like other graph-based convolutional neural networks. We
demonstrate the performance of the proposed network and compare it to
traditional pixel-based convolution neural network models and feature-based
graph convolutional neural networks on multiple large datasets.
