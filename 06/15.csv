personal information, individuals' privacy is of utmost importance. The
classical response is anonymization, i.e., sanitizing the information that can
directly or indirectly allow users' re-identification. The most popular
solution in the literature is the k-anonymity. However, it is hard to achieve
k-anonymity on a continuous stream of data, as well as when the number of
dimensions becomes high.In this paper, we propose a novel anonymization
property called z-anonymity. Differently from k-anonymity, it can be achieved
with zero-delay on data streams and it is well suited for high dimensional
data. The idea at the base of z-anonymity is to release an attribute (an atomic
information) about a user only if at least z - 1 other users have presented the
same attribute in a past time window. z-anonymity is weaker than k-anonymity
since it does not work on the combinations of attributes, but treats them
individually. In this paper, we present a probabilistic framework to map the
z-anonymity into the k-anonymity property. Our results show that a proper
choice of the z-anonymity parameters allows the data curator to likely obtain a
k-anonymized dataset, with a precisely measurable probability. We also evaluate
a real use case, in which we consider the website visits of a population of
users and show that z-anonymity can work in practice for obtaining the
k-anonymity too.

high-capacity demands in next-generation networks. To ensure uninterrupted
communication, existing lightpath provisioning schemes are mainly done with the
assumption of worst-case resource under-provisioning and fixed channel spacing,
which preserves an excessive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) margin. However, under
a resource over-provisioning scenario, the excessive SNR margin restricts the
transmission bit-rate or transmission reach, leading to physical layer resource
waste and stranded transmission capacity. To tackle this challenging problem,
we leverage an iterative feedback tuning algorithm to provide a just-enough SNR
margin, so as to maximize the network throughput. Specifically, the proposed
algorithm is implemented in three steps. First, starting from the high SNR
margin setup, we establish an integer linear programming model as well as a
heuristic algorithm to maximize the network throughput by solving the problem
of routing, modulation format, forward error correction, baud-rate selection,
and spectrum assignment. Second, we optimize the channel spacing of the
lightpaths obtained from the previous step, thereby increasing the available
physical layer resources. Finally, we iteratively reduce the SNR margin of each
lightpath until the network throughput cannot be increased. Through numerical
simulations, we confirm the throughput improvement in different networks and
with different baud-rates. In particular, we find that our algorithm enables
over 20\% relative gain when network resource is over-provisioned, compared to
the traditional method preserving an excessive SNR margin.

statistical learning tasks. In this paper, we consider the Mixed Linear
Regression (MLR) problem. We propose an optimal transport-based framework for
MLR problems, Wasserstein Mixed Linear Regression (WMLR), which minimizes the
Wasserstein distance between the learned and target mixture regression models.
Through a model-based duality analysis, WMLR reduces the underlying MLR task to
a nonconvex-concave minimax optimization problem, which can be provably solved
to find a minimax stationary point by the Gradient Descent Ascent (GDA)
algorithm. In the special case of mixtures of two linear regression models, we
show that WMLR enjoys global convergence and generalization guarantees. We
prove that WMLR's sample complexity grows linearly with the dimension of data.
Finally, we discuss the application of WMLR to the federated learning task
where the training samples are collected by multiple agents in a network.
Unlike the Expectation Maximization algorithm, WMLR directly extends to the
distributed, federated learning setting. We support our theoretical results
through several numerical experiments, which highlight our framework's ability
to handle the federated learning setting with mixture models.

the solution of the PDE is $\epsilon$-close with respect to the $H^1$ norm to a

norm of this approximate solution, depending at most polynomially on the
dimension $d$ of the PDE. As a direct consequence of the complexity estimates,
the solution of the PDE can be approximated on any bounded domain by a
two-layer neural network with respect to the $H^1$ norm with a
dimension-explicit convergence rate.

tokens. The most obvious and straightforward approach is to use words as
tokens. However, given a large text corpus, representing all the words is not
efficient in terms of vocabulary size. In the literature, many tokenization
algorithms have emerged to tackle this problem by creating subwords which in
turn limits the vocabulary size in a given text corpus. Most tokenization
techniques are language-agnostic i.e they don't incorporate the linguistic
features of a given language. Not to mention the difficulty of evaluating such
techniques in practice. In this paper, we introduce three new tokenization
algorithms for Arabic and compare them to three other baselines using
unsupervised evaluations. In addition to that, we compare all the six
algorithms by evaluating them on three supervised classification tasks which
are sentiment analysis, news classification and poetry classification using six
publicly available datasets. Our experiments show that none of the tokenization
technique is the best choice overall and that the performance of a given
tokenization algorithm depends on the size of the dataset, type of the task,
and the amount of morphology that exists in the dataset. However, some
tokenization techniques are better overall as compared to others on various

the safety and efficiency of transportation networks by allowing for high-speed
coordination. To enable such coordination, these systems rely on networked
communications. This can make them susceptible to cyber attacks. Though
security methods such as encryption or specially designed network topologies
can increase the difficulty of successfully executing such an attack, these
techniques are unable to guarantee secure communication against an attacker.
More troublingly, these security methods are unable to ensure that individual
agents are able to detect attacks that alter the content of specific messages.
To ensure resilient behavior under such attacks, this paper formulates a
networked linear time-varying version of dynamic watermarking in which each
agent generates and adds a private excitation to the input of its corresponding
robotic subsystem. This paper demonstrates that such a method can enable each
agent in a networked robotic system to detect cyber attacks. By altering
measurements sent between vehicles, this paper illustrates that an attacker can
create unstable behavior within a platoon. By utilizing the dynamic
watermarking method proposed in this paper, the attack is detected, allowing
the vehicles in the platoon to gracefully degrade to a non-communicative
control strategy that maintains safety across a variety of scenarios.

critical composition xc where superconducting Tc peaks. At this regime, nematic
fluctuations and symmetry-breaking strain could have an enormous impact, but
this is yet to be fully explored. Using spectroscopic-imaging scanning
tunneling microscopy, we study the electronic nematic transition in FeTe1-xSex
as a function of composition. Near xc, we reveal the emergence of electronic
nematicity in nanoscale regions. Interestingly, we discover that
superconductivity is drastically suppressed in areas where static nematic order
is the strongest. By analyzing atomic displacement in STM topographs, we find
that small anisotropic strain can give rise to these strongly nematic localized

estimating the disturbance topology, i.e., the (spatial) noise correlation

disturbance signal. In this work we present an identification method for
dynamic networks, in which an estimation of the disturbance topology precedes
the identification of the full dynamic network with known network topology. To
this end we extend the multi-step Sequential Linear Regression and Weighted
Null Space Fitting methods to deal with reduced rank noise, and use these
methods to estimate the disturbance topology and the network dynamics in the
full measurement situation. As a result, we provide a multi-step least squares

analytical solutions, thereby avoiding the usual non-convex optimizations
involved. Consequently we consistently estimate dynamic networks of Box Jenkins
model structure, while keeping the computational burden low. We provide a
consistency proof that includes path-based data informativity conditions for
allocation of excitation signals in the experimental design. Numerical
simulations performed on a dynamic network with reduced rank noise clearly

to people participating in a financial network subject to income shocks. We
build on the financial clearing framework of Eisenberg and Noe that allows the
incorporation of a bailout policy that is based on discrete bailouts motivated
by the types of stimulus checks people receive around the world as part of
COVID-19 economical relief plans. We show that optimally allocating such
bailouts on a financial network in order to maximize a variety of social
welfare objectives of this form is a computationally intractable problem. We
develop approximation algorithms to optimize these objectives and establish
guarantees for their approximation rations. Then, we incorporate multiple
fairness constraints in the optimization problems and establish relative bounds
on the solutions with versus without these constraints. Finally, we apply our
methodology to a variety of data, both in the context of a system of large
financial institutions with real-world data, as well as in a realistic societal
context with financial interactions between people and businesses for which we
use semi-artificial data derived from mobility patterns. Our results suggest
that the algorithms we develop and study have reasonable results in practice
and outperform other network-based heuristics. We argue that the presented
problem through the societal-level lens could assist policymakers in making
informed decisions on issuing subsidies.

associated with a number of signatures that can be identified in solar disc

coronagraph data is missing a clear low-coronal counterpart. These events have
received attention during recent years, mainly as a result of the increased
availability of multi-point observations, and are now known as 'stealth CMEs'.
In this work, we analyse examples of stealth CMEs featuring various levels of
ambiguity. All the selected case studies produced a large-scale CME detected by
coronagraphs and were observed from at least one secondary viewpoint, enabling
a priori knowledge of their approximate source region. To each event, we apply
several image processing and geometric techniques with the aim to evaluate
whether such methods can provide additional information compared to the study
of ""normal"" intensity images. We are able to identify at least weak eruptive
signatures for all events upon careful investigation of remote-sensing data,
noting that differently processed images may be needed to properly interpret
and analyse elusive observations. We also find that the effectiveness of
geometric techniques strongly depends on the CME propagation direction with
respect to the observers and the relative spacecraft separation. Being able to
observe and therefore forecast stealth CMEs is of great importance in the
context of space weather, since such events are occasionally the solar
counterparts of so-called 'problem geomagnetic storms'.

Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) solvers. In practice, iterative algorithms with
tolerance-based stopping criteria are used to avoid problems with slow or
infinite convergence. However, these heuristic stopping criteria can pose
difficulties for fairly comparing the efficiency of different implementations
of iterative propagation algorithms in a real-world setting. Most
significantly, the presence of unbounded variable domains in the problem
formulation makes it difficult to quantify the relative size of reductions
performed on them. In this work, we develop a method to measure --
independently of the algorithmic design -- the progress that a given iterative
propagation procedure has made at a given point in time during its execution.
Our measure makes it possible to study and better compare the behavior of
bounds propagation algorithms for linear constraints. We apply the new measure
to answer two questions of practical relevance: (i) We investigate to what
extent heuristic stopping criteria can lead to premature termination on
real-world MIP instances. (ii) We compare a GPU-parallel propagation algorithm
against a sequential state-of-the-art implementation and show that the parallel
version is even more competitive in a real-world setting than originally
reported.

from atmospheric and oceanic campaigns and global models. Recent direct
numerical simulations (DNSs) showed that large-scale intermittency in stably
stratified flows is due to the emergence of sporadic, extreme events in the
form of bursts in the vertical velocity and the temperature. This phenomenon
results from the interplay between waves and turbulent motions, affecting
mixing. We provide evidence of the enhancement of the classical small-scale (or
internal) intermittency due to the emergence of large-scale drafts, connecting
large- and small-scale bursts. To this aim we analyze a large set of DNSs of
the stably stratified Boussinesq equations over a wide range of values of the
Froude number ($Fr\approx 0.01-1$). The variation of the buoyancy field
kurtosis with $Fr$ is similar to (though with smaller values than) the kurtosis
of the vertical velocity, both showing a non-monotonic trend. We present a
mechanism for the generation of extreme vertical drafts and vorticity
enhancements which follows from the exact equations for field gradients.

economies (EMDE) such as India is causing loading and congestion problems on
distribution networks, particularly in urban locations, that adversely impact
sustainable development and economic growth. Electric utilities in these
economies face unique constraints regarding raising capital required to upgrade
their congested networks. Battery storage has emerged as a non-wire alternative
(NWA) to feeder upgrades. This article presents a flexible valuation framework
for battery storage use in distribution networks and its application in the
context of EMDE distribution network planning. We evaluate the value of storage
as an NWA using a multi-stage decision making process that combines system
optimization with markov-decision processes (MDP) to identify the least-cost
network upgrade strategy under demand growth uncertainty. When applied to
feeders in Delhi, India, the approach highlights the cost-effectiveness of
battery storage to manage load growth while deferring network investments.
Across the low, medium and high battery storage capital cost projections for
2030, we estimate that 18 to 29 GWh of battery storage capacity could be
deployed to defer 11,752 to 15,914 km of medium voltage distribution feeder
lines that are loaded at 60\% or more of their ampere capacity in 2030,
resulting in 12 to 16\% capital cost savings. Interestingly, the lowering
storage capital costs does not always increase NWA storage deployment, due to
network capacity constraints limiting opportunities for off-peak storage
charging.

Radioimmunotherapy has potential to increase tumor control rates.
Biomathematical models of response to radioimmunotherapy may help on
understanding of the mechanisms affecting response, and assist clinicians on
the design of optimal treatment strategies. In this work we present a
biomathematical model of tumor response to radioimmunotherapy. The model uses
the linear-quadratic response of tumor cells to radiation (or variation of it),
and builds on previous developments to include the radiation-induced immune
effect. We have focused this study on the combined effect of radiotherapy and
$\alpha$PDL1/$\alpha$CTLA4 therapies. The model can fit preclinical data of
volume dynamics and control obtained with different dose fractionations and
$\alpha$PDL1/$\alpha$CTLA4. A biomathematical study of optimal combination
strategies suggests that a good understanding of the involved biological
delays, the biokinetics of the immunotherapy drug, and the interplay between
them, may be of paramount importance to design optimal radioimmunotherapy
schedules. Biomathematical models like the one we present can help to interpret
experimental data on the synergy between radiotherapy and immunotherapy, and to
assist in the design of more effective treatments.

increasingly heterogeneous traffic in today's Internet. However, in presence of
high traffic load, not all offered traffic can be satisfied at all time. As
carried traffic load brings revenues to operators, traffic blocking due to
limited spectrum resource leads to revenue losses. In this study, given a set
of traffic requests to be provisioned, we consider the problem of maximizing
operator's revenue, subject to limited spectrum resource and physical layer
impairments (PLIs), namely amplified spontaneous emission noise (ASE),
self-channel interference (SCI), cross-channel interference (XCI), and node
crosstalk. In FONs, adaptive modulation, multiple FEC, and the tuning of power
spectrum density (PSD) can be effectively employed to mitigate the impact of
PLIs. Hence, in our study, we propose a universal bandwidth-related impairment
evaluation model based on channel bandwidth, which allows a performance
analysis for different PSD, FEC and modulations. Leveraging this PLI model and
a piecewise linear fitting function, we succeed to formulate the revenue
maximization problem as a mixed integer linear program. Then, to solve the
problem on larger network instances, a fast two-phase heuristic algorithm is
also proposed, which is shown to be near-optimal for revenue maximization.
Through simulations, we demonstrate that using adaptive modulation enables to
significantly increase revenues in the scenario of high signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR), where the revenue can even be doubled for high traffic load, while using
multiple FECs is more profitable for scenarios with low SNR.

vision tasks, yet their generalization under distribution shifts (DS) is rarely

(OOD) generalization of ViTs. For systematic investigation, we first present a
taxonomy of DS. We then perform extensive evaluations of ViT variants under
different DS and compare their generalization with Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) models. Important observations are obtained: 1) ViTs learn weaker biases
on backgrounds and textures, while they are equipped with stronger inductive
biases towards shapes and structures, which is more consistent with human
cognitive traits. Therefore, ViTs generalize better than CNNs under DS. With
the same or less amount of parameters, ViTs are ahead of corresponding CNNs by
more than 5% in top-1 accuracy under most types of DS. 2) As the model scale
increases, ViTs strengthen these biases and thus gradually narrow the
in-distribution and OOD performance gap. To further improve the generalization
of ViTs, we design the Generalization-Enhanced ViTs (GE-ViTs) from the
perspectives of adversarial learning, information theory, and self-supervised
learning. By comprehensively investigating these GE-ViTs and comparing with
their corresponding CNN models, we observe: 1) For the enhanced model, larger
ViTs still benefit more for the OOD generalization. 2) GE-ViTs are more
sensitive to the hyper-parameters than their corresponding CNN models. We
design a smoother learning strategy to achieve a stable training process and
obtain performance improvements on OOD data by 4% from vanilla ViTs. We hope
our comprehensive study could shed light on the design of more generalizable
learning architectures.

arbitrary order nonlinear perturbations propagating on dynamical analogue
spacetimes. Our results hold for all inviscid, spherically symmetric and
barotropic non-relativistic flows in the presence of an external conservative
force. We demonstrate that such fluids always admit a dynamical description
governed by a coupled pair of wave and continuity equations. We provide an
iterative approach to solve these equations about any known stationary solution
to all orders in perturbation. In the process, we reveal that there exists a
dynamical acoustic spacetime on which fluctuations of the mass accretion rate
propagate. The dynamical acoustic spacetime is shown to have a well defined
causal structure and curvature. In addition, we find a classical fluctuation
relation for the acoustic horizon of the spacetime that admit scenarios wherein
the horizon can grow as well as recede, with the latter being a result with no
known analogue in black holes. As an example, we numerically investigate the
Bondi flow accreting solution subject to exponentially damped time dependent
perturbations. We find that second and higher order classical perturbations
possess an acoustic horizon that oscillates and changes to a new stable size at
late times. In particular, the case of a receding acoustic horizon is realized
through `low frequency' perturbations. We discuss our results in the context of
more general analogue models and its potential implications on astrophysical

quantum mutual information reflecting maximal entanglement between qubits,
whereas entanglement between different clusters is taken into account via a new

problem by using fewer qubits and shallower circuit depth compared to standard
VQE at the cost of additional classical resources. In addition, a new gradient
measurement method without using an ancillary qubit is also developed in this
work. Proof-of-principle demonstrations are presented for several molecular
systems based on quantum simulators as well as an IBM quantum device with
accompanying error mitigation. The efficiency of the new algorithm is
comparable to or even improved over qubit-ADAPT-VQE and iterative Qubit Coupled

thereby full decarbonization of the grid. However, this can only occur with
drastic cost reductions compared to current battery technology, with predicted
targets for the cost per unit energy (CPE) below $20/kWh. Notably, for full
decarbonization, long duration storage up to 100 hrs will be needed at such low
costs, and prior analyses have shown that in such high renewable penetration
scenarios, CPE is more critical than other parameters such as round trip
efficiency or cost per unit power when comparing the costs of different
technologies. Here, we introduce an electricity storage concept that stores
electricity as sensible heat in graphite storage blocks and uses multi-junction
thermophotovoltaics (TPV) as a heat engine to convert it back to electricity on
demand. This design is an outgrowth of the system proposed by Amy et al. in
2019, which has been modified here to use a solid graphite medium and molten
tin as a heat transfer fluid rather than silicon as both. The reason for this
is two-fold: (1) the CPE of graphite is almost 10X lower than that of silicon,
which derives from the lower cost per unit mass (i.e., $0.5/kg vs. $1.5/kg) and
the higher heat capacity per unit mass (2000 J/kg-K vs. 950 J/kg-K); and (2)
the melting point tin and solubility of tin in graphite are much lower than
that of silicon, which lessens the number of issues that have to overcome along
the research and development pathway. The usage of graphite also eliminates the
need for a second tank, but the main disadvantage of using a solid medium is
that one cannot easily provide a steady discharge rate, as the power output
from the storage will change with time, as the graphite cools during discharge.
Thus, the objective of this work is to examine how these changes in the system
design effect the overall technoeconomics.

self-modulation component based on cross-attention. The resulting model,
denoted as HiT, has a nearly linear computational complexity with respect to

We show in the experiments that the proposed HiT achieves state-of-the-art FID

robust real-world decision making. The majority of existing work in causal
inference focuses on determining a single directed acyclic graph (DAG) or a

intelligently upon the knowledge about causal structure which has been inferred
from finite data demands reasoning about its uncertainty. For instance,
planning interventions to find out more about the causal mechanisms that govern
our data requires quantifying epistemic uncertainty over DAGs. While Bayesian
causal inference allows to do so, the posterior over DAGs becomes intractable
even for a small number of variables. Aiming to overcome this issue, we propose
a form of variational inference over the graphs of Structural Causal Models
(SCMs). To this end, we introduce a parametric variational family modelled by
an autoregressive distribution over the space of discrete DAGs. Its number of
parameters does not grow exponentially with the number of variables and can be
tractably learned by maximising an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). In our
experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed variational posterior is able to
provide a good approximation of the true posterior.

distinct regions within the space of gate-tuned charge carrier density and
applied electric displacement field, which we denote SC1 and SC2. The high
sample quality allows for detailed mapping of the normal state Fermi surfaces
by quantum oscillations, which reveal that in both cases superconductivity
arises from a normal state described by an annular Fermi sea that is proximal
to an isospin symmetry breaking transition where the Fermi surface degeneracy
changes. The upper out-of-plane critical field $B_{C\perp}\approx 10
\mathrm{mT}$ for SC1 and $1\mathrm{mT}$ for SC2, implying coherence lengths
$\xi$ of 200nm and 600nm, respectively. The simultaneous observation of
transverse magnetic electron focusing implies a mean free path
$\ell\gtrsim3.5\mathrm{\mu m}$. Superconductivity is thus deep in the clean
limit, with the disorder parameter $d=\xi/\ell<0.1$. SC1 emerge from a
paramagnetic normal state and is suppressed with in-plane magnetic fields in
agreement with the Pauli paramagnetic limit. In contrast, SC2 emerges from a
spin-polarized, valley-unpolarized half-metal. Measurements of the in-plane
critical field show that this superconductor exceeds the Pauli limit by at
least one order of magnitude. We discuss our results in light of several
mechanisms including conventional phonon-mediated pairing, pairing due to
fluctuations of the proximal isospin order, and intrinsic instabilities of the
annular Fermi liquid. Our observation of superconductivity in a clean and
structurally simple two-dimensional metal hosting a variety of gate tuned
magnetic states may enable a new class of field-effect controlled mesoscopic

challenging and often requires cumbersome stabilization techniques. Here, we
reveal a novel method that automatically leads to symmetric conditions, and
demonstrate its practical application in coherently-driven, two-mode, passive

defect between the modes of a driven nonlinear resonator makes SSB immune to
asymmetries by means of a period-doubled dynamics of the system's modal
evolution. The two-roundtrip evolution induces a self-symmetrization of the
system through averaging of the parameters, hence enabling the realization of
SSB with unprecedented robustness. This mechanism is universal: all
symmetry-broken solutions of driven Kerr resonators have a period-doubled
counterpart. We experimentally demonstrate this universality by considering the
polarization symmetry breaking of several different nonlinear structures found

limit on the size of the planet of 0.71 earth radii or 4500 km. We also
detected a medium-depth transit which can be used to constrain the dust
particle sizes. We find that the median particle size must be larger than about
0.5 to 1.0 microns, depending on the composition of the debris. This leads to a
high mass loss rate of about 3e8 kg/s that is consistent with hydrodynamic
escape models. If they are produced by some alternate mechanism such as
explosive volcanism, it would require extraordinary geological activity.

use the simulated GC populations in a sample of 166 central galaxies from the
$(34.4~\rm cMpc)^3$ periodic volume of the E-MOSAICS project. We find that more
massive galaxies host stellar and GC populations with shallower density
profiles that are more radially extended. In addition, the metal-poor GC
subpopulations tend to have shallower and more extended profiles than the
metal-rich subsamples, which we relate to the preferentially accreted origin of
the metal-poor GCs. We find strong correlations between the slopes and
effective radii of the radial profiles of the GC populations and the structural
properties of the DM haloes, such as their power-law slopes, scale radii, and
concentration parameters. Accounting for a dependence on the galaxy stellar
mass decreases the scatter of the two-dimensional relations. This suggests that
the projected number counts of GCs, combined with their galaxy mass, trace the
density profile of the DM halo of their host galaxy. When applied to
extragalactic GC systems, we recover the scale radii and the extent of the DM
haloes of a sample of ETGs with uncertainties smaller than $0.2~\rm dex$. Thus,
extragalactic GC systems provide a novel avenue to explore the structure of DM

and simplifications can be made? And, how is a selection function used in
`modelling'? We argue that volume-complete samples, with the volume drastically
curtailed by the faintest objects, reflect a highly sub-optimal selection
function that needlessly reduces the number of bright and usually rare objects
in the sample. We illustrate these points by a worked example, deriving the
space density of white dwarfs (WD) in the Galactic neighbourhood as a function
of their luminosity and Gaia color, $\Phi_0(M_G,B-R)$ in [mag$^{-2}$pc$^{-3}$].
We construct a sample of $10^5$ presumed WDs through straightforward selection
cuts on the Gaia EDR3 catalog, in magnitude, color, parallax, and astrometric
fidelity $\vec{q}=(m_G,B-R,\varpi,p_{af})$. We then combine a simple model for
$\Phi_0$ with the effective survey volume derived from this selection function
$S_C(\vec{q})$ to derive a detailed and robust estimate of $\Phi_0(M_G,B-R)$.
This resulting white dwarf luminosity-color function $\Phi_0(M_G,B-R)$ differs
dramatically from the initial number density distribution in the
luminosity-color plane: by orders of magnitude in density and by four
magnitudes in density peak location.

However, the complexity of overlapping evolutionary tracks often makes this
task numerically challenging, and with a precision that can be highly variable,
depending on the area of the parameter space the observation lies in. This work
presents StelNet, a Deep Neural Network trained on stellar evolutionary tracks
that quickly and accurately predicts mass and age from absolute luminosity and
effective temperature for stars with close to solar metallicity. The underlying
model makes no assumption on the evolutionary stage and includes the pre-main
sequence phase. We use bootstrapping and train many models to quantify the
uncertainty of the model. To break the model's intrinsic degeneracy resulting
from overlapping evolutionary paths, we also built a hierarchical model that
retrieves realistic posterior probability distributions of the stellar mass and
age. We further test and train StelNet using a sample of stars with
well-determined masses and ages from the literature.

fostered the formation of the younger-generation Huluwa 4-5 (7-20 Myr). A
supernova explosion located inside the Vela IRAS shell quenched star formation
in Huluwa 4-5 and rapidly expelled the remaining gas from the clusters. This
resulted in global mass stratification across the shell, which is confirmed by
the regression discontinuity method. The stellar mass in the lower rim of the
shell is $0.32\pm0.14$ $\rm M_\odot$ higher than in the upper rim. Local,
cluster-scale mass segregation is observed in the lowest-mass cluster Huluwa 5.
Huluwa 1-5 (in Vela OB2) are experiencing significant expansion, while the
cluster pair suffers from moderate expansion. The velocity dispersions suggest
that all five groups (including Huluwa 1A and Huluwa 1B) in Vela OB2 and the
cluster pair are supervirial and are undergoing disruption, and also that
Huluwa 1A and Huluwa 1B may be a coeval young cluster pair. N-body simulations

Ring, providing a valuable window into the planet's interior. Saturn's
fundamental modes (f modes) excite the majority of the observed waves, while
gravito-inertial modes (rotationally modified g modes) associated with stable
stratification in the deep interior provide a compelling explanation for
additional density waves with low azimuthal wavenumbers m. However, multiplets
of density waves with nearly degenerate frequencies, including an m=3 triplet,
still lack a definitive explanation. We investigate the effects of rapid and
differential rotation on Saturn's oscillations, calculating normal modes for
independently constrained interior models. We use a non-perturbative treatment
of rotation that captures the full effects of the Coriolis and centrifugal
forces, and consequently the mixing of sectoral f modes with g modes
characterized by very different spherical harmonic degrees. Realistic profiles
for differential rotation associated with Saturn's zonal winds can enhance
these mode interactions, producing detectable oscillations with frequencies
separated by less than 1%. Our calculations demonstrate that a three-mode
interaction involving an f mode and two g modes can feasibly explain the finely
split m=3 triplet, although the fine-tuning required to produce such an
interaction generally worsens agreement with seismological constraints provided
by m=2 density waves. Our calculations additionally demonstrate that sectoral f
mode frequencies are measurably sensitive to differential rotation in Saturn's
convective envelope. Finally, we find that including realistic equatorial
antisymmetry in Saturn's differential rotation profile couples modes with even
and odd equatorial parity, producing oscillations that could in principle
excite both density and bending waves simultaneously.

to identify AGN light curves with anomalous behaviors in massive datasets. The
main aim of this technique is to identify CSAGN at different stages of the
transition, but it can also be used for more general purposes, such as cleaning
massive datasets for AGN variability analyses. We used light curves from the
Zwicky Transient Facility data release 5 (ZTF DR5), containing a sample of
230,451 AGNs of different classes. The ZTF DR5 light curves were modeled with a
Variational Recurrent Autoencoder (VRAE) architecture, that allowed us to
obtain a set of attributes from the VRAE latent space that describes the
general behaviour of our sample. These attributes were then used as features
for an Isolation Forest (IF) algorithm, that is an anomaly detector for a ""one

coupling between the magnetic and dipolar order parameters results in
record-strength magnetoelectric effects. Two dimensional materials possessing
such intrinsic multiferroic properties have been long sought for harnessing
magnetoelectric coupling in nanoelectronic devices. Here, we report the
discovery of type-II multiferroic order in a single atomic layer of the

NiI2 is characterized by a proper-screw spin helix with given handedness, which

electrical polarization. We use circular dichroic Raman measurements to
directly probe the magneto-chiral ground state and its electromagnon modes
originating from dynamic magnetoelectric coupling. Using birefringence and
second-harmonic generation measurements, we detect a highly anisotropic
electronic state simultaneously breaking three-fold rotational and inversion
symmetry, and supporting polar order. The evolution of the optical signatures
as a function of temperature and layer number surprisingly reveals an ordered
magnetic, polar state that persists down to the ultrathin limit of monolayer
NiI2. These observations establish NiI2 and transition metal dihalides as a new
platform for studying emergent multiferroic phenomena, chiral magnetic textures

our entire redshift range. Conversely, the stellar mass-size relation is steep
for quiescent galaxies with stellar masses $\geq 10^{10.3}$M$_\odot$ and
flattens at lower masses, regardless of whether quiescence is selected based on
star-formation activity, rest-frame colours, or structural characteristics.
This flattening occurs at sizes of $\sim1$kpc at $z\leq1$. As a result, a
double power law is preferred for the stellar mass-size relation of quiescent
galaxies, at least above 10$^7$M$_\odot$. We find no strong redshift dependence

barycentre with a best-fit amplitude of $369$ km/s, in the direction ($\ell=

signal, this motion also causes an inevitable signature of statistical
anisotropy in the higher multipoles due to the modulation and aberration of the
CMB temperature and polarization fields. This leads to a correlation between
adjacent CMB multipoles causing a non-zero value of the off-diagonal terms in
the covariance matrix which can be captured in terms of the dipolar spectra of
the bipolar spherical harmonics (BipoSH). In our work, we jointly infer the CMB
power spectrum and the BipoSH spectrum in a Bayesian framework using the

spacetime with particular emphasis on the lensing in a Schwarzschild geometry.
Assuming Gaussian wave packets for neutrinos, we argue that the decoherence
length derived from the exponential suppression of the flavour transition
amplitude depends on the proper time of the geodesic connecting the events of
the production and detection in general gravitational setting. In the weak
gravity limit, the proper time between two events of given proper distance is
smaller than that in the flat spacetime. Therefore, in presence of a
Schwarzschild object, the neutrino wave packets have to travel relatively more
physical distance in space to lapse the same amount of proper time before they
decoher. For non-radial propagation applicable to the lensing phenomena, we
show that the decoherence, in general, is sensitive to the absolute values of
neutrino masses as well as the classical trajectories taken by neutrinos
between the source and detector along with the spatial widths of neutrino wave
packets. At distances beyond the decoherence length, the probability of
neutrino flavour transition due to lensing attains a value which depends only
on the leptonic mixing parameters. Hence, the observability of neutrino lensing
significantly depends on these parameters and in-turn the lensing can provide
useful information about them.

(HAeBes) within the empirical relation between the inner disk radius
(r$_{in}$), inferred from K-band interferometry, and the stellar luminosity
(L$_*$), is related to the presence of the innermost gas, the disk-to-star
accretion mechanism, the dust disk properties inferred from the spectral energy
distributions (SEDs), or a combination of these effects. This work aims to test
whether the previously proposed hypotheses do, in fact, serve as a general
explanation for the distribution of HAeBes in the size-luminosity diagram.
GRAVITY/VLTI spectro-interferometric observations at $\sim $2.2 $ \mu$m have
been obtained for five HBes representing two extreme cases concerning the
presence of innermost gas and accretion modes. V590 Mon, PDS 281, and HD 94509
show no excess in the near-ultraviolet, Balmer region of the spectra
($\Delta$D$_B$), indicative of a negligible amount of inner gas and
disk-to-star accretion, whereas DG Cir and HD 141926 show such strong
$\Delta$D$_B$ values that cannot be reproduced from magnetospheric accretion,
but probably come from the alternative boundary layer mechanism. Additional
data for these and all HAeBes resolved through K-band interferometry have been
compiled from the literature and updated using Gaia EDR3 distances, almost
doubling previous samples used to analyze the size-luminosity relation. We find
no general trend linking the presence of gas inside the dust destruction radius
or the accretion mechanism with the location of HAeBes in the size-luminosity
diagram. Underlying trends are present and must be taken into account when
interpreting the size-luminosity correlation. Still, it is argued that the
size-luminosity correlation is most likely to be physically relevant in spite
of the previous statistical warning concerning dependencies on distance.

candidate. A novel mechanism, 'composite pairing' based on the cooperative
two-channel Kondo effect directly involving the f-electron moments has also
been proposed for some heavy fermion compounds including CeCoIn$_5$. The origin
of the spin resonance peak observed in neutron scattering measurements on
CeCoIn$_5$ is still controversial and the corresponding hump-dip structure in
the tunneling conductance is missing. This is in contrast to the cuprate and
Fe-based high-temperature superconductors, where both characteristic signatures
are observed, indicating spin fluctuations are likely involved in the pairing
process. Here, we report results from planar tunneling spectroscopy along three
major crystallographic orientations of CeCoIn5 over wide ranges of temperature
and magnetic field. The pairing gap opens at T$_p$ ~ 5 K, well above the bulk
T$_c$ = 2.3 K, and its directional dependence is consistent with d$_{x^2-y^2}$
symmetry. With increasing magnetic field, this pairing gap is suppressed as
expected but, intriguingly, a gaplike structure emerges smoothly, increasing
linearly up to the highest field applied. This field-induced gaplike feature is
only observed below T$_p$. The concomitant appearance of the pairing gap and
the field-induced gaplike feature, along with its linear increase with field,
indicates that the f-electron local moments are directly involved in the
pairing process in CeCoIn$_5$.

observations. In this work, we compare the effects of two collision
prescriptions on the core-mantle differentiation of terrestrial planets: a
model in which collisions are always completely accretionary (``perfect
merging'') and a more realistic model based on neural networks that has been
trained on hydrodynamical simulations of giant impacts. The latter model is
able to predict the loss of mass due to imperfect accretion and the evolution
of non-accreted projectiles in hit-and-run collisions. We find that the results
of the neural-network model feature a wider range of final core mass fractions
and metal-silicate equilibration pressures, temperatures, and oxygen fugacities
than the assumption of perfect merging. When used to model collisions in N-body
studies of terrestrial planet formation, the two models provide similar answers
for planets more massive than 0.1 Earth's masses. For less massive final
bodies, however, the inefficient-accretion model predicts a higher degree of
compositional diversity. This phenomenon is not reflected in planet formation
models of the solar system that use perfect merging to determine collisional
outcomes. Our findings confirm the role of giant impacts as important drivers
of planetary diversity and encourage a realistic implementation of inefficient

non-uniformly magnetized slabs, which deviate from isothermal conditions, such
that the well-known Alfv\'en and slow continuous spectra enter the description.
We generalize modern MHD textbook treatments, by showing how self-gravity
enters the MHD wave equation, beyond the frequently adopted Cowling
approximation. This clarifies how Jeans' instability generalizes from hydro to
magnetohydrodynamic conditions without assuming the usual Jeans' swindle
approach. Our main contribution lies in reformulating the completely general
governing wave equations in a number of mathematically equivalent forms,
ranging from a coupled Sturm-Liouville formulation, to a Hamiltonian
formulation linked to coupled harmonic oscillators, up to a convenient matrix
differential form. The latter allows us to derive analytically the
eigenfunctions of a magnetized, self-gravitating thin slab. In addition, as an
example we give the exact closed form dispersion relations for the
hydrodynamical p- and Jeans-unstable modes, with the latter demonstrating how
the Cowling approximation modifies due to a proper treatment of self-gravity.
The various reformulations of the MHD wave equation open up new avenues for
future MHD spectral studies of instabilities as relevant for cosmic filament

graphene, can exhibit unconventional many-body correlations, not accessible in
other settings. All of these are driven by van der Waals forces: between the
atoms themselves and atom-material interactions. For example $^4$He atoms on 2D
materials can potentially form a variety of exotic quantum states of matter,
such as two-dimensional supersolids and superfluids, in addition to solid
phases. For the ""most quantum"" case of a single helium layer we discuss, from a
theoretical perspective, how the effective low-energy (Bose-Hubbard)
description can take advantage of the extreme sensitivity of this unique system
to the interplay between the atomic (helium) and solid-state (graphene)
components. Due to the extraordinary variety and tunability of 2D electronic
materials, we envisage that a wide range of correlated atomic phases can be
realized under favorable conditions. We also outline exciting possibilities in
the opposite extreme of many atomic layers forming a liquid on top of graphene
-- in this case a so-called ""spinodal de-wetting"" pattern can form at the
liquid-vapor interface which reflects the presence and electronic properties of
graphene underneath. Such patterns could be manipulated by choosing different
atoms and materials, with potential technological applications.

$\delta x=0$. Along these directions, correlation functions are obtained
exactly in terms of quantum channels built from the individual gates that make

grows at the maximum allowed speed up to an entropy density of at least one

  DNN-MG is a novel neural network-based technique for the simulation of the

  The neural network replaces in DNN-MG one or multiple finest multigrid layers
and provides a correction for the classical solve in the next time step.
  This leads to little degradation in the solution quality while substantially
reducing the overall computational costs.
  At the same time, the use of the multigrid solver at the coarse scales allows
for a compact network that is easy to train, generalizes well, and allows for
the incorporation of physical constraints.
  Previous work on DNN-MG focused on the overall scheme and how to enforce
divergence freedom in the solution.
  In this work, we investigate how the network size affects training and
solution quality and the overall runtime of the computations.
  Our results demonstrate that larger networks are able to capture the

  At runtime, the use of the neural network correction can even reduce the
computation time compared to a classical multigrid simulation through a faster
convergence of the nonlinear solve that is required at every time step.

Can we teach them instead to identify paraphrases in a way that draws on the

2CY categories, along with \'etale neighbourhood theorems for stacks, to prove
that the morphism $p$ is modelled \'etale-locally by the semisimplification

$\mathfrak{M}$, which is conjecturally a complete space of generators for the
BPS algebra associated to $\mathscr{C}$.
  We prove purity of the Borel-Moore homology of the moduli stack
$\mathfrak{M}$, provided its good moduli space $\mathcal{M}$ is projective, or
admits a suitable contracting $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. In particular, when
$\mathfrak{M}$ is the moduli stack of Gieseker-semistable sheaves on a K3

moreover prove purity for several stacks of coherent sheaves that do not admit

Borel-Moore homology of the stack of semistable degree $d$ rank $r$ Higgs

sedimentation can be significantly affected by collective settling mechanisms
that promote premature ash deposition, with important implications for
associated impacts. Among these mechanisms, settling-driven gravitational
instabilities result from the formation of a gravitationally-unstable particle
boundary layer (PBL) that grows between volcanic ash clouds and the underlying
atmosphere. The PBL destabilises once it reaches a critical thickness,
triggering the formation of rapid, downward-moving ash fingers that remain
poorly characterised. We simulate this process by coupling a Lattice Boltzmann
model, which solves the Navier-Stokes equations for the fluid phase, with a
Weighted Essentially Non Oscillatory (WENO) finite difference scheme which
solves the advection-diffusion-settling equation describing particle transport.
Since the physical problem is advection dominated, the use of the WENO scheme
reduces numerical diffusivity and ensures accurate tracking of the temporal
evolution of the interface between the layers. We have validated the new model
by showing that the simulated early-time growth rate of the instability is in
very good agreement with that predicted by linear stability analysis, whilst
the modelled late-stage behaviour also successfully reproduces quantitative
results from published laboratory experiments.

sampling, this estimator has asymptotic variance that is never worse than the

preserve both the asymptotic efficiency of AIPW and the regret bounds for

the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. An immersed Boundary Method (IBM) is
employed to solve for the motion of fibers. In concentrated suspensions, fibers
come into contact due to the presence of asperities on their surface. We assume
a normal load-dependent friction coefficient to model contact dynamics and
friction, which successfully recovers the shear-thinning behaviour observed in
experiments. First, we report the shear rate dependent behavior and the
increase in the suspension viscosity with the increasing volume fraction of
fibers, fiber roughness, and rigidity. The increase in the viscosity is
stronger at a lower shear rate and finite inertia. Simulation results indicate
that for the concentrated suspensions, contact stresses between fibers form the
dominant contribution to the viscosity. Moreover, we find the first normal
stress difference to be positive and to increase with the Reynolds number for
flexible fibers. Lastly, we explore the divergence of viscosity for different
aspect ratios and roughness of the fibers and predict the jamming volume
fraction by fitting the data to the Maron-Pierce law. The jamming volume
fraction decreases with increasing the aspect ratio and roughness. We conclude

  https://github.com/HanGuo97/soft-Q-learning-for-text-generation",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is the predominant algorithm for training
text generation models. This paradigm relies on direct supervision examples,
which is not applicable to many emerging applications, such as generating
adversarial attacks or generating prompts to control language models.
Reinforcement learning (RL) on the other hand offers a more flexible solution
by allowing users to plug in arbitrary task metrics as reward. Yet previous RL
algorithms for text generation, such as policy gradient (on-policy RL) and
Q-learning (off-policy RL), are often notoriously inefficient or unstable to
train due to the large sequence space and the sparse reward received only at
the end of sequences. In this paper, we introduce a new RL formulation for text
generation from the soft Q-learning (SQL) perspective. It enables us to draw
from the latest RL advances, such as path consistency learning, to combine the
best of on-/off-policy updates, and learn effectively from sparse reward. We
apply the approach to a wide range of novel text generation tasks, including
learning from noisy/negative examples, adversarial attacks, and prompt
generation. Experiments show our approach consistently outperforms both
task-specialized algorithms and the previous RL methods.

positive predictive value, sensitivity and F1 score of >=90% to identify the

emits localization signals that are used by anchor nodes to estimate the target

eavesdropper nodes and jammer nodes which aim to estimate the position of the

propose the problem of eavesdropper selection with the goal of optimally
placing a given number of eavesdropper nodes to a subset of possible positions
in the network to estimate the target node position as accurately as possible.
As the performance metric, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) related to the
estimation of the target node position by eavesdropper nodes is derived, and
its convexity and monotonicity properties are investigated. By relaxing the
integer constraints, the eavesdropper selection problem is approximated by a
convex optimization problem and algorithms are proposed for eavesdropper
selection. Moreover, in the presence of parameter uncertainty, a robust version
of the eavesdropper selection problem is developed. Then, the problem of jammer
selection is proposed where the aim is to optimally place a given number of
jammer nodes to a subset of possible positions for degrading the localization
accuracy of the network as much as possible. A CRLB expression from the

procedure. In this procedure, the animal is rewarded for the first response
after a fixed delay from the stimulus onset, but on some trials, the stimulus
remains and no reward is given. The common methods and models to analyse the
response pattern describe it as break-run-break, a period of low rate response
followed by rapid responding, followed by a low rate of response. The study of
the pattern has found correlations between start, stop, and duration of the run
period that hold across species and experiment.
  It is commonly assumed that in order to achieve the statistics with a
pacemaker accumulator model it is necessary to have start and stop thresholds.
In this paper we will develop a new model that varies response rate in relation
to the likelihood of event occurrence, as opposed to a threshold, for changing
the response rate. The new model reproduced the start and stop statistics that
have been observed in 14 different PI experiments from 3 different papers. The
developed model is also compared to the Time-adaptive Drift-diffusion Model
(TDDM), the latest accumulator model subsuming the scalar expectancy theory

explicit start and stop thresholds or an internal equivalent to break-run-break
states to reproduce the individual trials statistics and population behaviour
and get the same break-run-break analysis results. The new model also produces
more realistic individual trials compared to TDDM.

two parties leverage the wireless channel randomness to establish a secret key.
The essence in the framework is to quantify channel randomness into bit

has been a common practice to provide the confidence to validate whether they
are random. Interestingly, despite different settings in the tests, existing
studies interpret the results the same: passing tests means that the bit

particular, we define an adversary model that leverages the imperfect
randomness of the wireless channel to search the generated key, and create a
guideline to set up randomness testing and privacy amplification to eliminate
security loss and achieve efficient key generation rate. We use theoretical
analysis and comprehensive experiments to reveal that common practice misuses

Vershynin (2020) settled a long standing question by Baum (1988), proving that
\emph{deep threshold} networks can memorize $n$ points in $d$ dimensions using
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(e^{1/\delta^2}+\sqrt{n})$ neurons and
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(e^{1/\delta^2}(d+\sqrt{n})+n)$ weights, where $\delta$

$X$ and $Y$ of possibly different dimensions and types. Recent years have
witnessed concentrated efforts in the literature to understand the
distributional properties of the sample distance covariance in a
high-dimensional setting, with an exclusive emphasis on the null case that $X$
and $Y$ are independent. This paper derives the first non-null central limit
theorem for the sample distance covariance, and the more general sample
(Hilbert-Schmidt) kernel distance covariance in high dimensions, primarily in
the Gaussian case. The new non-null central limit theorem yields an
asymptotically exact first-order power formula for the widely used generalized
kernel distance correlation test of independence between $X$ and $Y$. The power
formula in particular unveils an interesting universality phenomenon: the power
of the generalized kernel distance correlation test is completely determined by
$n\cdot \text{dcor}^2(X,Y)/\sqrt{2}$ in the high dimensional limit, regardless
of a wide range of choices of the kernels and bandwidth parameters.
Furthermore, this separation rate is also shown to be optimal in a minimax
sense. The key step in the proof of the non-null central limit theorem is a
precise expansion of the mean and variance of the sample distance covariance in
high dimensions, which shows, among other things, that the non-null Gaussian
approximation of the sample distance covariance involves a rather subtle

Specifically, we consider $Y = A X\in \mathbb{R}^{p\times n}$ where the matrix

distinguishable observers. I argue that such reasoning leads to solipsism, the
belief that one is the only being in the world, and is therefore unacceptable.
Using variants of the ""Sleeping Beauty"" thought experiment as a guide, I
present a framework for evaluating observations in a large cosmos: Fine
Graining with Auxiliary Indexicals (FGAI). FGAI requires the construction of
specific models of physical outcomes and observations. Valid typicality
arguments then emerge from the combinatorial properties of third-person
physical microhypotheses. Indexical (observer-relative) facts do not directly
constrain physical theories. Instead they serve to weight different provisional
evaluations of credence. These weights define a probabilistic reference class
of locations. As indexical knowledge changes, the weights shift. I show that
the self-applied Doomsday Argument fails in FGAI, even though it can work for
an external observer. I also discuss how FGAI could handle observations in

beyond the shot-noise limit (SNL). In order to better take advantage of
available quantum resources and obtain the maximum possible sensitivity, it is
necessary to determine fundamental sensitivity limits for different possible
configurations for a given sensing system. Here, due to their wide
applicability, we focus on optical resonance sensors, which detect a change in
a parameter of interest through a resonance shift. We compare their fundamental
sensitivity limits set by the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound (QCRB) based on the
estimation of changes in transmission or phase of a probing bright two-mode
squeezed state (bTMSS) of light. We show that the fundamental sensitivity
results from an interplay between the QCRB and the transfer function of the
system. As a result, for a resonance sensor with a Lorentzian lineshape a
phase-based scheme outperforms a transmission-based one for most of the
parameter space; however, this is not the case for lineshapes with steeper
slopes, such as higher order Butterworth lineshapes. Furthermore, such an
interplay results in conditions under which the phase-based scheme provides a
higher sensitivity than the transmission-based one but a smaller degree of
quantum enhancement. We also study the effect of losses external to the sensor
on the degree of quantum enhancement and show that for certain conditions
probing with a classical state can provide a higher sensitivity than probing
with a bTMSS. Finally, we discuss detection schemes, namely optimized
intensity-difference and optimized homodyne detection, that can achieve the
fundamental sensitivity limits even in the presence of external losses.

a named entity recognition (NER) model to annotate the full collection with

model pre-trained on Dutch archaeological texts. We compare the model's quality
and output on a Named Entity Recognition task to a generic multilingual model

multiple BERT models, and combining the best BERT model with a domain thesaurus
using Conditional Random Fields (CRF). We find that ArcheoBERTje outperforms
both the multilingual and Dutch model significantly with a smaller standard

outperforms ensemble methods combining the three models. Combining ArcheoBERTje
predictions and explicit domain knowledge from the thesaurus did not increase

glasses are materials of choice for numerous microelectronic and photonic
devices. However, to extend the range of compositions and applications,
profound knowledge about composition-property relationships is necessary. To
this end, we collected a large quantity of composition-property data on
chalcogenide glasses from SciGlass database regarding glass transition
temperature ($T_g$), Young's modulus ($E$), coefficient of thermal expansion
(CTE), and refractive index ($n_D$). With these data, we induced predictive
models using three machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, K-nearest
Neighbors, and Classification and Regression Trees. Finally, the induced models
were interpreted by computing the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values
of the chemical features, which revealed the key elements that significantly
impacted the tested properties and quantified their impact. For instance, Ge
and Ga increase $T_g$ and $E$ and decrease CTE (three properties that depend on
bond strength), whereas Se has the opposite effect. Te, As, Tl, and Sb increase
$n_D$ (which strongly depends on polarizability), whereas S, Ge, and P diminish
it. Knowledge about the effect of each element on the glass properties is
precious for semi-empirical compositional development trials or
simulation-driven formulations. The induced models can be used to design novel
chalcogenide glasses with required combinations of properties.

  Cellular Automata","16 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables",,,,"cs.CR cs.DM cs.FL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Orthogonal Cellular Automata (OCA) have been recently investigated in the
literature as a new approach to construct orthogonal Latin squares for
cryptographic applications such as secret sharing schemes. In this paper, we
consider OCA for a different cryptographic task, namely the generation of
pseudorandom sequences. The idea is to iterate a dynamical system where the
output of an OCA pair is fed back as a new set of coordinates on the superposed
squares. The main advantage is that OCA ensure a certain amount of diffusion in
the generated sequences, a property which is usually missing from traditional
CA-based pseudorandom number generators. We study the problem of finding OCA
pairs with maximal period by first performing an exhaustive search up to local
rules of diameter $d=5$, and then focusing on the subclass of linear
bipermutive rules. In this case, we characterize the periods of the sequences
in terms of the order of the subgroup generated by an invertible Sylvester
matrix. We finally devise an algorithm based on Lagrange's theorem to
efficiently enumerate all linear OCA pairs of maximal period up to diameter
$d=11$.

modern optimization algorithms into mechanisms where inputs come from
self-interested agents. We focus on aggregating preferences from $n$ players in
a context without money. Special cases of this setting include voting,
allocation of items by lottery, and matching. Our key technical contribution is
a new meta-algorithm we call \apex (Adaptive Pricing Equalizing Externalities).
The framework is sufficiently general to be combined with any optimization
algorithm that is based on local search. We outline an agenda for studying the
algorithm's properties and its applications. As a special case of applying the
framework to the problem of one-sided assignment with lotteries, we obtain a
strengthening of the 1979 result by Hylland and Zeckhauser on allocation via a
competitive equilibrium from equal incomes (CEEI). The [HZ79] result posits
that there is a (fractional) allocation and a set of item prices such that the
allocation is a competitive equilibrium given prices. We further show that
there is always a reweighing of the players' utility values such that running
unit-demand VCG with reweighed utilities leads to a HZ-equilibrium prices.
Interestingly, not all HZ competitive equilibria come from VCG prices. As part
of our proof, we re-prove the [HZ79] result using only Brouwer's fixed point
theorem (and not the more general Kakutani's theorem). This may be of
independent interest.

Nuclei (AGN) dichotomy in the 1/2 types, narrow/broad emission lines. In a
previous work, on the basis of parsec-scale resolution infrared / optical dust
maps it was found that dust filaments, few parsecs wide, several hundred
parsecs long, were ubiquitous features crossing the centre of type 2 AGN, their
optical thickness being sufficient to fully obscure the optical nucleus. This
work presents the complementary view for type 1 and intermediate-type AGN. The
same type of narrow, collimated, dust filaments are equally found at the centre
of these AGN. The difference now resides in their location with respect to the
nucleus, next to it but not crossing it, as it is the case in type 2, and their
reduced optical thickness towards the centre, $A_V \lesssim 1.5 \rm{mag}$,
insufficient to obscure at UV nucleus wavelengths. It is concluded that large
scale, hundred pc to kpc long, dust filaments and lanes, reminiscent of those
seen in the Milky Way, are a common ingredient to the central parsec of
galaxies. Their optical thickness changes along their structure, in type 2
reaching optical depths high enough to obscure the nucleus in full. Their
location with respect to the nucleus and increasing gradient in optical depth
towards the centre could naturally lead to the canonical type 1/2 AGN
classification, making these filaments to play the role of the torus. Dust
filaments and lanes show equivalent morphologies in molecular gas. Available
gas kinematic indicates mass inflows at rates $ < ~ 1 M\odot~ yr^{-1}$.

observation of atmospheric neutrinos with IceCube, limiting all individual
coupling strengths from a single dataset. Furthermore, IceCube is the first
experiment to constrain flavor-violating and nonuniversal couplings
simultaneously. Hypothetical NSI are generically expected to arise due to the
exchange of a new heavy mediator particle. Neutrinos propagating in matter
scatter off fermions in the forward direction with negligible momentum
transfer. Hence the study of the matter effect on neutrinos propagating in the
Earth is sensitive to NSI independently of the energy scale of new physics. We
present constraints on NSI obtained with an all-flavor event sample of
atmospheric neutrinos based on three years of IceCube DeepCore data. The
analysis uses neutrinos arriving from all directions, with reconstructed
energies between 5.6 GeV and 100 GeV. We report constraints on the individual
NSI coupling strengths considered singly, allowing for complex phases in the
case of flavor-violating couplings. This demonstrates that IceCube is sensitive
to the full NSI flavor structure at a level competitive with limits from the
global analysis of all other experiments. In addition, we investigate a
generalized matter potential, whose overall scale and flavor structure are also
constrained.

ranging from $r \sim 150\,$au to $r \sim 250\,$au and whose presence was
formerly postulated in low-angular-resolution ALMA cycle 0 observations but
never before observed. Notably, the dust emission of the outer ring is not
homogeneous, and it shows two prominent azimuthal asymmetries that resemble an
eccentric ring with eccentricity $e = 0.07 $. The characteristic double-ring
dust structure of HD 100546 is likely produced by the interaction of the disk
with multiple giant protoplanets. This paper includes new
smoothed-particle-hydrodynamic simulations with two giant protoplanets, one
inside of the inner dust cavity and one in the dust gap. The simulations
qualitatively reproduce the observations, and the final masses and orbital
distances of the two planets in the simulations are 3.1 $M_{J}$ at 15 au and
8.5 $M_{J}$ at 110 au, respectively. The massive outer protoplanet
substantially perturbs the disk surface density distribution and gas dynamics,
producing multiple spiral arms both inward and outward of its orbit. This can
explain the observed perturbed gas dynamics inward of 100 au as revealed by
ALMA observations of CO.
  Finally, the reduced dust surface density in the $\sim 40-150\,$au dust gap

years in limited labeled data regimes. However, the current state-of-the-art
SSL algorithms are computationally expensive and entail significant compute
time and energy requirements. This can prove to be a huge limitation for many
smaller companies and academic groups. Our main insight is that training on a
subset of unlabeled data instead of entire unlabeled data enables the current
SSL algorithms to converge faster, significantly reducing computational costs.
In this work, we propose RETRIEVE, a coreset selection framework for efficient
and robust semi-supervised learning. RETRIEVE selects the coreset by solving a
mixed discrete-continuous bi-level optimization problem such that the selected
coreset minimizes the labeled set loss. We use a one-step gradient
approximation and show that the discrete optimization problem is approximately
submodular, enabling simple greedy algorithms to obtain the coreset. We
empirically demonstrate on several real-world datasets that existing SSL
algorithms like VAT, Mean-Teacher, FixMatch, when used with RETRIEVE, achieve
a) faster training times, b) better performance when unlabeled data consists of
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data and imbalance. More specifically, we show that
with minimal accuracy degradation, RETRIEVE achieves a speedup of around
$3\times$ in the traditional SSL setting and achieves a speedup of $5\times$

fundamentally superior rate-loss scaling than point-to-point QKD systems. A
surge of research and development effort in the last two years has produced
many variants of protocols and experimental demonstrations. In terms of
hardware topology, TFQKD systems interfering quantum signals from two remotely
phase-locked laser sources are in essence giant Mach-Zehnder interferometers
(MZIs) requiring active phase stabilization. Such configurations are inherently
unsuitable for a TFQKD network, where more than one user-pair share the common
quantum measurement station, because it is practically extremely difficult, if
not impossible, to stabilize MZIs of largely disparate path lengths, a
situation that is inevitable in a multi-user-pair TFQKD network. On the other
hand, Sagnac interferometer based TFQKD systems exploiting the inherent phase
stability of the Sagnac ring can implement asymmetric TFQKD, and are therefore
eminently suitable for implementing a TFQKD network. In this work, we
experimentally demonstrate a proof-of-principle multi-user-pair Sagnac TFQKD
network where three user pairs sharing the same measurement station can perform
pair-wise TFQKD through time multiplexing, with channel losses up to 58 dB, and
channel loss asymmetry up to 15 dB. In some cases, the secure key rates still
beat the rate-loss bounds for point-to-point repeaterless QKD systems, even in

Despite the promising results, the practical relevance of these technologies

The paper presents an approach for analyzing aerial images of a potato (Solanum
tuberosum L.) crop using deep neural networks. The main objective is to
demonstrate automated spatial recognition of healthy vs. stressed crop at a
plant level. Specifically, we examine premature plant senescence resulting in
drought stress on Russet Burbank potato plants. We propose a novel deep
learning (DL) model for detecting crop stress, named Retina-UNet-Ag. The
proposed architecture is a variant of Retina-UNet and includes connections from
low-level semantic representation maps to the feature pyramid network. The
paper also introduces a dataset of aerial field images acquired with a Parrot
Sequoia camera. The dataset includes manually annotated bounding boxes of
healthy and stressed plant regions. Experimental validation demonstrated the
ability for distinguishing healthy and stressed plants in field images,
achieving an average dice score coefficient (DSC) of 0.74. A comparison to
related state-of-the-art DL models for object detection revealed that the
presented approach is effective for this task. The proposed method is conducive
toward the assessment and recognition of potato crop stress in aerial field

""driving"" video or set of images to another person. Existing efforts leverage a
long training video from each target person to train a subject-specific motion
transfer model. However, the scalability of such methods is limited, as each
model can only generate videos for the given target subject, and such training
videos are labor-intensive to acquire and process. Few-shot motion transfer
techniques, which only require one or a few images from a target, have recently
drawn considerable attention. Methods addressing this task generally use either
2D or explicit 3D representations to transfer motion, and in doing so,
sacrifice either accurate geometric modeling or the flexibility of an
end-to-end learned representation. Inspired by the Transformable Bottleneck
Network, which renders novel views and manipulations of rigid objects, we
propose an approach based on an implicit volumetric representation of the image
content, which can then be spatially manipulated using volumetric flow fields.
We address the challenging question of how to aggregate information across
different body poses, learning flow fields that allow for combining content
from the appropriate regions of input images of highly non-rigid human subjects
performing complex motions into a single implicit volumetric representation.
This allows us to learn our 3D representation solely from videos of moving
people. Armed with both 3D object understanding and end-to-end learned
rendering, this categorically novel representation delivers state-of-the-art
image generation quality, as shown by our quantitative and qualitative
evaluations.

viscoelastic fluids described by the Johnson-Segalman and Giesekus models is
studied analytically. Solutions for the pressure and velocity fields as well as
the force on the particle are expanded as a power series in the Weissenberg
number. The momentum balance and constitutive equation are solved
asymptotically for a steadily translating particle up to second order in the
particle velocity, and rescaling of the pressure and velocity in the frequency
domain is used to relate the solutions for steady lineal translation to those
for unsteady lineal translation. The unsteady force at third order in the
particle velocity is then calculated through application of the Lorentz
reciprocal theorem, and it is shown that this weakly nonlinear contribution to
the force can be expressed as part of a Volterra series. Through a series of
examples, it is shown that a truncated representation of this Volterra series,
which can be manipulated to describe the velocity in terms of an imposed force,
is useful for analyzing specific time-dependent particle motions. Two examples
studied using this relationship are the force on a particle suddenly set into
motion and the velocity of a particle in response to a suddenly imposed steady
force. Additionally, the weakly nonlinear response of particle captured by a
harmonic trap moving lineally through the fluid is computed. This is an analog
to active microrheology experiments, and can be used to explain how weakly
nonlinear responses manifest in active microrheology experiments with spherical

of the orbital relaxation by comparing the Heisenberg model magnetic coupling

restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock orbitals. We show that orbital relaxation
differentially stabilizes the lower spin states, thus enlarging the coupling

applications. In this problem, instead of i.i.d. training and testing
datapoints, we assume that the source (training) data and the target (testing)
data have different distributions. With that setting, the empirical risk
minimization training procedure often does not perform well, since it does not
account for the change in the distribution. A common approach in the domain
adaptation literature is to learn a representation of the input that has the
same (marginal) distribution over the source and the target domain. However,
these approaches often require additional networks and/or optimizing an
adversarial (minimax) objective, which can be very expensive or unstable in
practice. To improve upon these marginal alignment techniques, in this paper,
we first derive a generalization bound for the target loss based on the
training loss and the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the
source and the target representation distributions. Based on this bound, we
derive an algorithm that minimizes the KL term to obtain a better
generalization to the target domain. We show that with a probabilistic
representation network, the KL term can be estimated efficiently via minibatch
samples without any additional network or a minimax objective. This leads to a
theoretically sound alignment method which is also very efficient and stable in
practice. Experimental results also suggest that our method outperforms other

quantum phenomena such as critical states and phasons. Nevertheless, the
systematic understanding of the Landau levels of quasicrystals in the presence
of the magnetic field has not been established yet. One of the main obstacles
is the complication of the quasiperiodic tilings without periodic length
scales, thus it has been thought that the system cannot possess any universal
features of the Landau levels. In this paper, contrary to these assertions, we
develop a generic theory of the Landau levels for quasicrystals. Focusing on
the two dimensional quasicrystals with rotational symmetries, we highlight that
quasiperiodic tilings induce anomalous Landau levels where electrons are
localized near the rotational symmetry centers. Interestingly, the localization
length of these Landau levels has a universal dependence on n for quasicrystals
with n-fold rotational symmetry. Furthermore, macroscopically degenerate zero
energy Landau levels are present due to the chiral symmetry of the rhombic
tilings. In this case, each Landau level forms an independent island where
electrons are trapped at given fields, but with field control, the interference

sequences of graphs is analyzed in this work. The oscillators in this model
have random intrinsic frequencies and interact with each other via nonlinear
coupling. The connectivity of the coupled system is assigned by a graph which
may be random as well. In the thermodynamic limit the behavior of the system is
captured by the Vlasov equation, a hyperbolic partial differential equation for
the probability distribution of the oscillators in the phase space. We study
stability of mixing, a steady state solution of the Vlasov equation,
corresponding to the uniform distribution of phases. Specifically, we identify
a critical value of the strength of coupling, at which the system undergoes a
pitchfork bifurcation. It corresponds to the loss of stability of mixing and
marks the onset of synchronization. As for the classical Kuramoto model, the
presence of the continuous spectrum on the imaginary axis poses the main
difficulty for the stability analysis. To overcome this problem, we use the
methods from the generalized spectral theory developed for the original
Kuramoto model. The analytical results are illustrated with numerical
bifurcation diagrams computed for the Kuramoto model on Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi and
small-world graphs. Applications of the second-order Kuramoto model include
power networks, coupled pendula, and various biological networks. The analysis
in this paper provides a mathematical description of the onset of

of space weather. With the lackluster performance of extrapolations based upon
magnetic field measurements in the photosphere, we identify a region in the
near UV part of the spectrum as optimal for studying the development of
magnetic free energy over active regions. Using data from SORCE, Hubble Space
Telescope, and SKYLAB, along with 1D computations of the near-UV (NUV) spectrum
and numerical experiments based on the MURaM radiation-MHD and HanleRT
radiative transfer codes, we address multiple challenges. These challenges are
best met through a combination of near UV lines of bright \ion{Mg}{2}, and
lines of \ion{Fe}{2} and \ion{Fe}{1} (mostly within the $4s-4p$ transition
array) which form in the chromosphere up to $2\times10^4$ K. Both Hanle and
Zeeman effects can in principle be used to derive vector magnetic fields.
However, for any given spectral line the $\tau=1$ surfaces are generally
geometrically corrugated owing to fine structure such as fibrils and spicules.
By using multiple spectral lines spanning different optical depths, magnetic
fields across nearly-horizontal surfaces can be inferred in regions of low
plasma $\beta$, from which free energies, magnetic topology and other
quantities can be derived.
  Based upon the recently-reported successful suborbital space measurements of
magnetic fields with the CLASP2 instrument,
  we argue that a modest space-borne telescope will be able to make significant
advances in the attempts to predict solar eruptions. Difficulties associated
with blended lines are shown to be minor in an Appendix.

stochastic manner over an undirected connected graph, under various assumptions
on the spread dynamics. A decision maker must place a limited number of
detectors on a subset of the nodes in the graph in order to rapidly detect
infection of the nodes by the virus. The objective is to determine the
placement of these detectors so as to either maximize the probability of
detection within a given time period or minimize the expected time to
detection. Previous work in this area assumed that the detectors are perfectly
reliable. In this work, it is assumed that the detectors may produce
false-negative results. In computational studies, the sample average
approximation method is applied to solving the problem using a mixed-integer
program and a greedy heuristic. The heuristic is shown to be highly efficient
and to produce high-quality solutions. In addition, it is shown that the
false-negative effect can sometimes be ignored, without significant loss of

meaningfully one has to employ regularization methods. Traditionally, the most
popular regularization approaches are Variational-type approaches, i.e.,
penalized/constrained functional minimization. In recent years, the classical
regularization approaches have been replaced by the so-called plug-and-play
(PnP) algorithms, which copies the proximal gradient minimization processes,

traditional proximal gradient methods, the theoretical analysis and convergence

from these algorithms, though empirically outstanding, are not well-defined, in

more heuristic approaches. To address this shortfall, we develop a framework

resultant tsunamis via probability distributions, the framework allows
practitioners to make principled estimates of key characteristics (e.g.,
magnitude and location) of historical earthquakes. To illustrate this idea, we
apply the methodology to the estimation of an earthquake in Eastern Indonesia

considerable debate in the geological community. The approach taken here gives
evidence that even ""small data"" that is limited in scope and extremely

their lack of interoperability has been a major barrier for clinical

Definitions and Services for the representation and communication of digital

analysis results. However, the complexity of the standard represents an
obstacle for its adoption in the ML community and creates a need for software
libraries and tools that simplify working with data sets in DICOM format. Here
we present the highdicom library, which provides a high-level application
programming interface for the Python programming language that abstracts
low-level details of the standard and enables encoding and decoding of
image-derived information in DICOM format in a few lines of Python code. The
highdicom library ties into the extensive Python ecosystem for image processing
and machine learning. Simultaneously, by simplifying creation and parsing of
DICOM-compliant files, highdicom achieves interoperability with the medical
imaging systems that hold the data used to train and run ML models, and
ultimately communicate and store model outputs for clinical use. We demonstrate
through experiments with slide microscopy and computed tomography imaging,
that, by bridging these two ecosystems, highdicom enables developers to train
and evaluate state-of-the-art ML models in pathology and radiology while
remaining compliant with the DICOM standard and interoperable with clinical
systems at all stages. To promote standardization of ML research and streamline
the ML model development and deployment process, we made the library available

a large base dataset which is typically from the same domain as the target
dataset. We tackle the problem of cross-domain few-shot learning where there is
a large shift between the base and target domain. The problem of cross-domain
few-shot recognition with unlabeled target data is largely unaddressed in the
literature. STARTUP was the first method that tackles this problem using
self-training. However, it uses a fixed teacher pretrained on a labeled base
dataset to create soft labels for the unlabeled target samples. As the base
dataset and unlabeled dataset are from different domains, projecting the target
images in the class-domain of the base dataset with a fixed pretrained model
might be sub-optimal. We propose a simple dynamic distillation-based approach
to facilitate unlabeled images from the novel/base dataset. We impose
consistency regularization by calculating predictions from the weakly-augmented
versions of the unlabeled images from a teacher network and matching it with
the strongly augmented versions of the same images from a student network. The
parameters of the teacher network are updated as exponential moving average of
the parameters of the student network. We show that the proposed network learns
representation that can be easily adapted to the target domain even though it
has not been trained with target-specific classes during the pretraining phase.
Our model outperforms the current state-of-the art method by 4.4% for 1-shot
and 3.6% for 5-shot classification in the BSCD-FSL benchmark, and also shows
competitive performance on traditional in-domain few-shot learning task.

Zone, and is the fastest prograde jet on Jupiter, reaching speeds above $170$
m/s. In this region, observations have shown several periodic convective
plumes, likely from latent heat release from water condensation, which affect
the cloud and zonal wind structure of the jet. We model this region with the
Explicit Planetary hybrid-Isentropic Coordinate model using its active
microphysics scheme to study the phenomenology of water and ammonia clouds
within the jet region. On perturbing the atmosphere, we find that an upper
tropospheric wave develops that directly influences the cloud structure within
the jet. This wave travels at $\sim75$ m/s in our model, and leads to periodic
chevron-shaped features in the ammonia cloud deck. These features travel with
the wave speed, and are subsequently much slower than the zonal wind at the
cloud deck. The cloud structure, and the slower drift rate, were both observed
following the convective outbreak in this region in 2016 and 2020. We find that
an upper level circulation is responsible for these cloud features in the
aftermath of the convective outbursts. The comparatively slower observed drift
rates of these features, relative to the wind speed of the jet, provides
constraints on the vertical wind shear above the cloud tops, and we suggest
that wind velocities determined from cloud tracking should correspond to a
different altitude compared to the $680$ hPa pressure level. We also diagnose
the convective potential of the atmosphere due to water condensation, and find
that it is strongly coupled to the wave.

linear structure, in order to guarantee sample efficient RL. Such efforts
typically assume the transition dynamics or value function of the MDP are
described by linear functions of the state features. To resolve this
discrepancy between theory and practice, we introduce the Effective Planning
Window (EPW) condition, a structural condition on MDPs that makes no linearity
assumptions. We demonstrate that the EPW condition permits sample efficient RL,
by providing an algorithm which provably solves MDPs satisfying this condition.
Our algorithm requires minimal assumptions on the policy class, which can
include multi-layer neural networks with nonlinear activation functions.
Notably, the EPW condition is directly motivated by popular gaming benchmarks,
and we show that many classic Atari games satisfy this condition. We
additionally show the necessity of conditions like EPW, by demonstrating that
simple MDPs with slight nonlinearities cannot be solved sample efficiently.

ways: First, they contain a wide range of primitives; Second, they frequently
leverage communicative strategies beyond directly executable codes. We

capability of plenoptic devices, along with dramatically enhanced performances,
unattainable in standard plenoptic cameras: diffraction-limited resolution,
large depth of focus, and ultra-low noise. To further increase the volumetric
resolution beyond the Rayleigh diffraction limit, and achieve the quantum

information. However, for the quantum advantages of the proposed devices to be
effective and appealing to end-users, two main challenges need to be tackled.
First, due to the large number of frames required for correlation measurements
to provide an acceptable SNR, quantum plenoptic imaging would require, if
implemented with commercially available high-resolution cameras, acquisition
times ranging from tens of seconds to a few minutes. Second, the elaboration of
this large amount of data, in order to retrieve 3D images or refocusing 2D
images, requires high-performance and time-consuming computation. To address
these challenges, we are developing high-resolution SPAD arrays and
high-performance low-level programming of ultra-fast electronics, combined with
compressive sensing and quantum tomography algorithms, with the aim to reduce
both the acquisition and the elaboration time by two orders of magnitude.
Routes toward exploitation of the QPI devices will also be discussed.

context, justifying their application in several areas, particularly in
clinical practice. Several machine-learning classifiers have exploited the
advantageous properties of decision rules to build intelligent prediction
models, namely decision trees and ensembles of trees (ETs). However, such
methodologies usually suffer from a trade-off between interpretability and
predictive performance. Some procedures consider a simplification of ETs, using
heuristic approaches to select an optimal reduced set of decision rules. In
this paper, we introduce a novel step to those methodologies. We create a new
component to predict if a given rule will be correct or not for a particular
patient, which introduces personalization into the procedure. Furthermore, the
validation results using three public clinical datasets suggest that it also
allows to increase the predictive performance of the selected set of rules,
improving the mentioned trade-off.

many-body systems. A particularly appealing idea is to use cavities to enhance
superconductivity, especially in unconventional or high-$T_c$ systems.
Motivated by this, we propose a scheme for coupling Terahertz resonators to the
antiferromagnetic fluctuations in a cuprate parent compound, which are believed
to provide the glue for Cooper pairs in the superconducting phase. First, we
derive the interaction between magnon excitations of the Ne\'el-order and polar
phonons associated with the planar oxygens. This mode also couples to the
cavity electric field, and in the presence of spin-orbit interactions mediates
a linear coupling between the cavity and magnons, forming hybridized
magnon-polaritons. This hybridization vanishes linearly with photon momentum,
implying the need for near-field optical methods, which we analyze within a
simple model. We then derive a higher-order coupling between the cavity and
magnons which is only present in bilayer systems, but does not rely on
spin-orbit coupling. This interaction is found to be large, but only couples to
the bimagnon operator. As a result we find a strong, but heavily damped,
bimagnon-cavity interaction which produces highly asymmetric cavity line-shapes
in the strong-coupling regime. To conclude, we outline several interesting
extensions of our theory, including applications to carrier-doped cuprates and
other strongly-correlated systems with Terahertz-scale magnetic excitations.

  Privacy",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In deep learning with differential privacy (DP), the neural network achieves
the privacy usually at the cost of slower convergence (and thus lower
performance) than its non-private counterpart. This work gives the first
convergence analysis of the DP deep learning, through the lens of training
dynamics and the neural tangent kernel (NTK). Our convergence theory
successfully characterizes the effects of two key components in the DP
training: the per-sample clipping and the noise addition. Our analysis not only
initiates a general principled framework to understand the DP deep learning
with any network architecture and loss function, but also motivates a new
clipping method -- the global clipping, that significantly improves the
convergence, as well as preserves the same DP guarantee and computational
efficiency as the existing method, which we term as local clipping.
  Theoretically speaking, we precisely characterize the effect of per-sample
clipping on the NTK matrix and show that the noise level of DP optimizers does
not affect the convergence in the gradient flow regime. In particular, the
local clipping almost certainly breaks the positive semi-definiteness of NTK,
which can be preserved by our global clipping. Consequently, DP gradient
descent (GD) with global clipping converge monotonically to zero loss, which is
often violated by the existing DP-GD. Notably, our analysis framework easily
extends to other optimizers, e.g., DP-Adam. We demonstrate through numerous
experiments that DP optimizers equipped with global clipping perform strongly
on classification and regression tasks. In addition, our global clipping is
surprisingly effective at learning calibrated classifiers, in contrast to the
existing DP classifiers which are oftentimes over-confident and unreliable.
Implementation-wise, the new clipping can be realized by inserting one line of
code into the Pytorch Opacus library.

with private setups, e.g., pre-setup threshold cryptosystem. Challenges remain
to reduce the large communication in the absence of such setups. Recently,
Abraham et al. (PODC'21) presented the first asynchronous validated BA (VBA)
with expected $O(n^3)$ messages and $O(1)$ rounds, relying on only public key
infrastructure (PKI) setup, but the design still costs $O({\lambda}n^3 \log n)$
bits. Here $n$ is the number of parties, and $\lambda$ is a cryptographic
security parameter.
  In this paper, we reduce the communication of private-setup free asynchronous
BA to expected $O(\lambda n^3)$ bits. At the core of our design, we give a
systematic treatment of common randomness protocols in the asynchronous
network, and proceed as: - We give an efficient reasonably fair common coin
protocol in the asynchronous setting with only PKI setup. It costs only
$O(\lambda n^3)$ bits and $O(1)$ rounds, and ensures that with at least 1/3
probability, all honest parties can output a common bit that is as if randomly
flipped. This directly renders more efficient private-setup free asynchronous
binary agreement (ABA) with expected $O(\lambda n^3)$ bits and $O(1)$ rounds. -
Then, we lift our common coin to attain perfect agreement by using a single
ABA. This gives us a reasonably fair random leader election protocol with
expected $O(\lambda n^3)$ communication and expected constant rounds. It is
pluggable in all existing VBA protocols (e.g., Cachin et al., CRYPTO'01;
Abraham et al., PODC'19; Lu et al., PODC'20) to remove the needed private setup
or distributed key generation (DKG). As such, the communication of
private-setup free VBA is reduced to expected $O(\lambda n^3)$ bits while
preserving fast termination in expected $O(1)$ rounds.

($EAS$) values for California is presented in this study. $EAS$, which is
defined in Goulet et al. (2018), is a smoothed rotation-independent Fourier
amplitude spectrum of the two horizontal components of an acceleration time
history. The main motivation for developing a non-ergodic $EAS$ GMM, rather
than a spectral acceleration GMM, is that the scaling of $EAS$ does not depend
on spectral shape, and therefore, the more frequent small magnitude events can
be used in the estimation of the non-ergodic terms.
  The model is developed using the California subset of the NGAWest2 dataset
Ancheta et al. (2013). The Bayless and Abrahamson (2019b) (BA18) ergodic $EAS$
GMM was used as backbone to constrain the average source, path, and site
scaling. The non-ergodic GMM is formulated as a Bayesian hierarchical model:
the non-ergodic source and site terms are modeled as spatially varying
coefficients following the approach of Landwehr et al. (2016), and the
non-ergodic path effects are captured by the cell-specific anelastic
attenuation attenuation following the approach of Dawood and Rodriguez-Marek
(2013). Close to stations and past events, the mean values of the non-ergodic
terms deviate from zero to capture the systematic effects and their epistemic
uncertainty is small. In areas with sparse data, the epistemic uncertainty of
the non-ergodic terms is large, as the systematic effects cannot be determined.
  The non-ergodic total aleatory standard deviation is approximately $30$ to
$40\%$ smaller than the total aleatory standard deviation of BA18. This
reduction in the aleatory variability has a significant impact on hazard
calculations at large return periods. The epistemic uncertainty of the ground
motion predictions is small in areas close to stations and past events.

to higher replica numbers $n >1$ by considering the replica-invariant surfaces
(aka `splitting surfaces') $\boldsymbol{\mathbf{\gamma}}$ of real-time
replica-wormhole saddle-points computing R\'enyi entropies $S_n(D)$ and showing
that there is a sense in which $D$ must again be causally inaccessible from
$\boldsymbol{\mathbf{\gamma}}$ when the saddle preserves both replica and
conjugation symmetry. This property turns out to imply the $S_n(D)$ to be
independent of any choice of any Cauchy surface $\Sigma_D$ for $D$, and also
that the $S_n(D)$ are independent of the choice of boundary sources within $D$.
This is a key hallmark of unitary evolution in any dual field theory.
Furthermore, from the bulk point of view it adds to the evidence that time
evolution of asymptotic observables in quantum gravity is implemented by a
unitary operator in each baby universe superselection sector. Though we focus
here on pure Einstein-Hilbert gravity and its Kaluza-Klein reductions, we
expect the argument to extend to any two-derivative theory who satisfies the

particular, $\delta=\epsilon$ is necessary to avoid an $O(1)$ discrepancy
between the theories. However, the flow at the surface of the fiber differs by
an expression proportional to $\log(1+\delta^2/\epsilon^2)$, and any choice of
$\delta\propto\epsilon$ will result in an $O(1)$ discrepancy as $\epsilon\to
0$. Consequently, the flow around a slender fiber due to regularized SBT does
not converge to the solution of the well-posed \emph{slender body PDE} which
classical SBT is known to approximate. Numerics verify this $O(1)$ discrepancy
but also indicate that the difference may have little impact in practice.

transfer in internally heated turbulent shear flow with constant bulk mean
velocity and temperature, $u_{b}$ and $\theta_{b}$, between parallel,
isothermal, no-slip and permeable walls. The wall-normal transpiration velocity
on the walls $y=\pm h$ is assumed to be proportional to the local pressure
fluctuations, i.e. $v=\pm \beta p/\rho$ (Jim\'enez et al., J. Fluid Mech., vol.
442, 2001, pp.89-117). The temperature is supposed to be a passive scalar, and
the Prandtl number is set to unity. Turbulent heat and momentum transfer in
permeable-channel flow for $\beta u_{b}=0.5$ has been found to exhibit distinct
states depending on the Reynolds number $Re_b=2h u_b/\nu$. At $Re_{b}\lesssim
10^4$, the classical Blasius law of the friction coefficient and its similarity
to the Stanton number, $St\approx c_{f}\sim Re_{b}^{-1/4}$, are observed,
whereas at $Re_{b}\gtrsim 10^4$, the so-called ultimate scaling, $St\sim
Re_b^0$ and $c_{f}\sim Re_b^0$, is found. The ultimate state is attributed to
the appearance of large-scale intense spanwise rolls with the length scale of
$O(h)$ arising from the Kelvin-Helmholtz type of shear-layer instability over
the permeable walls. The large-scale rolls can induce large-amplitude velocity
fluctuations of $O(u_b)$ as in free shear layers, so that the Taylor
dissipation law $\epsilon\sim u_{b}^{3}/h$ (or equivalently $c_{f}\sim Re_b^0$)
holds. In spite of strong turbulence promotion there is no flow separation, and
thus large-amplitude temperature fluctuations of $O(\theta_b)$ can also be
induced similarly. As a consequence, the ultimate heat transfer is achieved,
i.e., a wall heat flux scales with $u_{b}\theta_{b}$ (or equivalently $St\sim
Re_b^0$) independent of thermal diffusivity, although the heat transfer on the
walls is dominated by thermal conduction.

techniques for attesting code integrity (i.e. verifying that it has not been
modified) rely on firmware access or roots-of-trust, neither of which
proprietary or legacy PLCs are likely to provide. In this paper, we propose a
practical code integrity checking solution based on privacy-preserving black
box models that instead attest the input/output behaviour of PLC programs.
Using faithful offline copies of the PLC programs, we identify their most
important inputs through an information flow analysis, execute them on multiple
combinations to collect data, then train neural networks able to predict PLC
outputs (i.e. actuator commands) from their inputs. By exploiting the black box
nature of the model, our solution maintains the privacy of the original PLC
code and does not assume that attackers are unaware of its presence. The trust
instead comes from the fact that it is extremely hard to attack the PLC code
and neural networks at the same time and with consistent outcomes. We evaluated
our approach on a modern six-stage water treatment plant testbed, finding that
it could predict actuator states from PLC inputs with near-100% accuracy, and
thus could detect all 120 effective code mutations that we subjected the PLCs
to. Finally, we found that it is not practically possible to simultaneously
modify the PLC code and apply discreet adversarial noise to our attesters in a

person-of-interest from heterogeneous cameras, easily suffering from large
image modality discrepancy caused by different sensing wavelength ranges.
Existing work usually minimizes such discrepancy by aligning domain
distribution of global features, while neglecting the intra-modality structural
relations between semantic parts. This could result in the network overly
focusing on local cues, without considering long-range body part dependencies,
leading to meaningless region representations. In this paper, we propose a
graph-enabled distribution matching solution, dubbed Geometry-Guided
Dual-Alignment (G2DA) learning, for RGB-IR ReID. It can jointly encourage the
cross-modal consistency between part semantics and structural relations for
fine-grained modality alignment by solving a graph matching task within a
multi-scale skeleton graph that embeds human topology information.
Specifically, we propose to build a semantic-aligned complete graph into which
all cross-modality images can be mapped via a pose-adaptive graph construction
mechanism. This graph represents extracted whole-part features by nodes and
expresses the node-wise similarities with associated edges. To achieve the
graph-based dual-alignment learning, an Optimal Transport (OT) based structured
metric is further introduced to simultaneously measure point-wise relations and
group-wise structural similarities across modalities. By minimizing the cost of
an inter-modality transport plan, G2DA can learn a consistent and
discriminative feature subspace for cross-modality image retrieval.
Furthermore, we advance a Message Fusion Attention (MFA) mechanism to
adaptively reweight the information flow of semantic propagation, effectively
strengthening the discriminability of extracted semantic features.

a deep critic network evaluates the actor, we propose a Population-coding and

analysis features. Therefore, a malware author might make evasive binary
modifications against Machine Learning models as part of the malware
development life cycle to execute an attack successfully. This makes the
studying of possible classifier evasion strategies an essential part of cyber
defense against malice. To this extent, we stage a grey box setup to analyze a
scenario where the malware author does not know the target classifier
algorithm, and does not have access to decisions made by the classifier, but
knows the features used in training. In this experiment, a malicious actor
trains a surrogate model using the EMBER-2018 dataset to discover binary
mutations that cause an instance to be misclassified via a Monte Carlo tree
search. Then, mutated malware is sent to the victim model that takes the place
of an antivirus API to test whether it can evade detection.

The computation of attribution maps relies on ad-hoc calibration steps that are
not part of the training computational graph, making it difficult for us to
understand the real meaning of the attribution values. In this paper, we
improve CAM by explicitly incorporating a latent variable encoding the location
of the cue for recognition in the formulation, thereby subsuming the
attribution map into the training computational graph. The resulting model,
class activation latent mapping, or CALM, is trained with the
expectation-maximization algorithm. Our experiments show that CALM identifies
discriminative attributes for image classifiers more accurately than CAM and

object tracking have achieved compelling results on the normal sequences.
Whilst Siamese-based trackers assume training and test data follow an identical
distribution. Suppose there is a set of foggy or rainy test sequences, it
cannot be guaranteed that the trackers trained on the normal images perform
well on the data belonging to other domains. The problem of domain shift among
training and test data has already been discussed in object detection and
semantic segmentation areas, which, however, has not been investigated for
visual tracking. To this end, based on SiamRPN++, we introduce a Domain
Adaptive SiamRPN++, namely DASiamRPN++, to improve the cross-domain
transferability and robustness of a tracker. Inspired by A-distance theory, we
present two domain adaptive modules, Pixel Domain Adaptation (PDA) and Semantic
Domain Adaptation (SDA). The PDA module aligns the feature maps of template and
search region images to eliminate the pixel-level domain shift caused by
weather, illumination, etc. The SDA module aligns the feature representations
of the tracking target's appearance to eliminate the semantic-level domain
shift. PDA and SDA modules reduce the domain disparity by learning domain
classifiers in an adversarial training manner. The domain classifiers enforce
the network to learn domain-invariant feature representations. Extensive
experiments are performed on the standard datasets of two different domains,
including synthetic foggy and TIR sequences, which demonstrate the
transferability and domain adaptability of the proposed tracker.

  SnSe",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  There is growing interest in using ultrafast light pulses to drive functional
materials into nonequilibrium states with novel properties. The conventional
wisdom is that above gap photoexcitation behaves similarly to raising the
electronic temperature and lacks the desired selectivity in the final state.
Here we report a novel nonthermal lattice instability induced by ultrafast
above-gap excitation in SnSe, a representative of the IV-VI class of
semiconductors that provides a rich platform for tuning material functionality
with ultrafast pulses due to their multiple lattice instabilities. The new
lattice instability is accompanied by a drastic softening of the lowest
frequency A$_g$ phonon. This mode has previously been identified as the soft
mode in the thermally driven phase transition to a Cmcm structure. However, by
a quantitative reconstruction of the atomic displacements from time-resolved
x-ray diffraction for multiple Bragg peaks and excitation densities, we show
that ultrafast photoexcitation with near-infrared (1.55 eV) light, induces a
distortion towards a different structure with Immm symmetry. The Immm structure
of SnSe is an orthorhombic distortion of the rocksalt structure and does not
occur in equilibrium. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that
the photoinduced Immm lattice instability arises from electron excitation from
the Se 4$p$- and Sn 5$s$-derived bands deep below the Fermi level that cannot
be excited thermally. The results have implications for optical control of the
thermoelectric, ferroelectric and topological properties of the
monochalcogenides and related materials. More generally, the results emphasize
the need for ultrafast structural probes to reveal distinct atomic-scale

and critical challenge for recommender systems (RS). Cross-domain
recommendations (CDR) offer a solution to tackle such a cold-start problem when
there is no sufficient data for the users who have rarely used the system. An
effective approach in CDR is to leverage the knowledge (e.g., user
representations) learned from a related but different domain and transfer it to
the target domain. Fine-tuning works as an effective transfer learning
technique for this objective, which adapts the parameters of a pre-trained
model from the source domain to the target domain. However, current methods are
mainly based on the global fine-tuning strategy: the decision of which layers
of the pre-trained model to freeze or fine-tune is taken for all users in the
target domain. In this paper, we argue that users in RS are personalized and
should have their own fine-tuning policies for better preference transfer
learning. As such, we propose a novel User-specific Adaptive Fine-tuning method
(UAF), selecting which layers of the pre-trained network to fine-tune, on a
per-user basis. Specifically, we devise a policy network with three alternative
strategies to automatically decide which layers to be fine-tuned and which
layers to have their parameters frozen for each user. Extensive experiments
show that the proposed UAF exhibits significantly better and more robust

be simultaneously both sensitive and stable. To solve this problem, the brain
has been hypothesised to sit near a critical boundary. Yet, precisely how
criticality and these opposing information processing modes are implemented in
the brain remains elusive. A potential solution to this problem involves
modulating intrinsically nonlinear neurons within the cerebral cortex with
neuromodulatory neurotransmitters such as noradrenaline, a highly-conserved
chemical released from the pontine locus coeruleus. Here we confirm that
neuronal spiking in mice is poised close to the critical point of a branching
process and that time-varying signatures of criticality fluctuate with
neuromodulatory tone, as assessed by dynamic alterations in pupil diameter. We
explore these results theoretically by creating a dual-compartment model of
non-linear pyramidal neurons - capable of both regular spike and bursting modes
- that replicates our main empirical findings of slightly subcritical dynamics.
We then probe our model at a resolution impossible in vivo to demonstrate that
noradrenaline differentially alters spiking- and bursting-criticality to
facilitate sensitive and stable dynamics following an inverted-U profile that
peaks at intermediate noradrenergic tone. Finally, we demonstrate that this
intermediate noradrenergic regime displays burst avalanches with power-law size
and duration distributions and scaling relationship belonging to the
universality class of self-organized criticality. Our results confirm that the
noradrenergic ascending arousal system acts as a control parameter for emergent
critical dynamics in the brain. This methodology could be extended to explore
other neuromodulators as control parameters of the brain.

approximation algorithm for NTK, by sketching the polynomial expansions of
arc-cosine kernels: our sketch for the convolutional counterpart of NTK (CNTK)
can transform any image using a linear runtime in the number of pixels.
Furthermore, we prove a spectral approximation guarantee for the NTK matrix, by
combining random features (based on leverage score sampling) of the arc-cosine
kernels with a sketching algorithm. We benchmark our methods on various
large-scale regression and classification tasks and show that a linear
regressor trained on our CNTK features matches the accuracy of exact CNTK on
CIFAR-10 dataset while achieving 150x speedup.

finite-temperature composition-dependent equation of state (EOS) with a first
order phase transition between hadrons and deconfined quarks to perform
numerical relativity simulations of BNS mergers. The softening of the EOS due
to the phase transition causes the merger remnants to be more compact and to
collapse to a black hole (BH) at earlier times. The phase transition is
imprinted on the postmerger gravitational wave (GW) signal duration, amplitude,
and peak frequency. However, this imprint is only detectable for binaries with
sufficiently long-lived remnants. Moreover, the phase transition does not
result in significant deviations from quasi-universal relations for the
postmerger GW peak frequency. We also study the impact of the phase transition
on dynamical ejecta, remnant accretion disk masses, r-process nucleosynthetic
yields and associated electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. While there are
differences in the EM counterparts and nucleosynthesis yields between the
purely hadronic models and the models with phase transitions, these can be
primarily ascribed to the difference in remnant collapse time between the two.
An exception is the non-thermal afterglow caused by the interaction of the
fastest component of the dynamical ejecta and the interstellar medium, which is
systematically boosted in the binaries with phase transition as a consequence
of the more violent merger they experience.

they undergo abrupt phase transformation during the charging/discharging cycle.
This phase transformation is accompanied by lattice misfit strains that
nucleate microcracks, induce fracture and, in extreme cases, amorphize the
intercalation electrode. In this work, we propose a strategy to prevent the
chemo-mechanical degradation of intercalation electrodes: we show that by
engineering suitable film strains we can regulate the phase transformations in
thin-film intercalation electrodes and circumvent the large volume changes. We
test this strategy using a combination of theory and experiment: we first
analytically derive the effect of film strain on the electrochemical response
of a thin-film intercalation electrode and next apply our analytical model to a
representative example (LixV2O5 with multiple phase transformations). We then
test our theoretical predictions experimentally. Specifically, we
electrochemically cycle thin-film V2O5 electrodes with different film strains
and measure their structure, voltage, and stress responses. Our findings show
that tensile film strains lower the voltage for phase transformations in
thin-film V2O5 electrodes and facilitate their reversible cycling across a
wider voltage window without chemo-mechanical degradation. These results
suggest that film strain engineering is an alternative approach to preventing
chemo-mechanical degradation in intercalation electrodes. Beyond thin-film
electrodes, our findings from this study are applicable to the study of
stress-induced phase transformations in particle-based electrodes and the thin
surface layers forming on cathode particles.

divided in-vehicle networks into sub-networks, logically isolating critical
devices. However, attackers may still have physical access to various

that process deep features extracted from voltage signals measured on the CAN

locate physical intrusions when the vehicle starts; this mechanism can detect
and locate intrusions, even when the connected malicious devices are silent.
This mechanism's effectiveness (100% accuracy) is demonstrated in a wide

the interplay of superconductivity and CDW state by involving nontrivial
topology of band structures. Here, we conduct high-pressure electrical
transport and magnetic susceptibility measurements to study CsV3Sb5 with the
highest Tc of 2.7 K in AV3Sb5 family. While the CDW transition is monotonically
suppressed by pressure, superconductivity is enhanced with increasing pressure
up to P1~0.7 GPa, then an unexpected suppression on superconductivity happens
until pressure around 1.1 GPa, after that, Tc is enhanced with increasing
pressure again. The CDW is completely suppressed at a critical pressure P2~2
GPa together with a maximum Tc of about 8 K. In contrast to a common dome-like

star forming galaxies (SFGs) and synchrotron cosmic web emission out to a
redshift of $z = 0.8$ and over the frequency range 100-1400 MHz. To do this,
the simulation brings together a recent $100^3$ Mpc$^3$ magneto-hydrodynamic
simulation (Vazza et al., 2019), calibrated to match observed radio relic
population statistics, alongside updated `T-RECS' code for simulating
extragalactic radio sources (Bonaldi et al., 2019). Uniquely, the AGNs and SFGs
are populated and positioned in accordance with the underlying matter density

accurate understanding of the apparent morphology, angular scales, and

properties of the cosmic web with respect to the embedded extragalactic radio
population. We find that the synchrotron cosmic web does not closely trace the
underlying mass distribution of the cosmic web, but is instead dominated by
shocked shells of emission surrounding dark matter halos and resembles a large,
undetected population of radio relics. We also show that, with accurate
kernels, the cosmic web radio emission is clearly detectable by
cross-correlation techniques and this signal is separable from the embedded
extragalactic radio population. We offer the simulation as a public resource

The correlations between the outflow parameters and protostellar properties are
presented, which shows that the strengths of molecular outflows increase with

prone to significant errors for small ensemble sizes, causing the filter

First, we use a combination of an artificial neural network (ANN) and a linear

color distortions due to the non-uniform attenuation of the light as it
propagates through the water. In addition, the degree of attenuation varies
with the wavelength resulting in the asymmetric traversing of colors. Despite
the prolific works for underwater image restoration (UIR) using deep learning,
the above asymmetricity has not been addressed in the respective network
engineering.
  Contributions: As the first novelty, this paper shows that attributing the
right receptive field size (context) based on the traversing range of the color
channel may lead to a substantial performance gain for the task of UIR.
Further, it is important to suppress the irrelevant multi-contextual features
and increase the representational power of the model. Therefore, as a second
novelty, we have incorporated an attentive skip mechanism to adaptively refine
the learned multi-contextual features. The proposed framework, called Deep
WaveNet, is optimized using the traditional pixel-wise and feature-based cost
functions. An extensive set of experiments have been carried out to show the

of the electrostatic disjoining pressure to the excess osmotic pressure at the
walls two different regimes occur. In the thick channel regime this ratio is
small and the channel effectively behaves as thick, even when the diffuse
layers strongly overlap. The latter is possible for highly charged channels
only. In the thin channel regime the disjoining pressure is comparable to the
excess osmotic pressure at the wall, which implies relatively weakly charged
walls. We derive simple expressions for the mean conductivity of the channel in
these two regimes, highlighting the role of electrostatic and
electro-hydrodynamic boundary conditions. Our theory provides a simple
explanation of the high conductivity observed experimentally in hydrophilic
channels, and allows one to obtain rigorous bounds on its attainable value and
scaling with salt concentration. Our results also show that further dramatic
amplification of conductivity is possible if hydrophobic slip is involved, but
only in the thick channel regime provided the walls are sufficiently highly
charged and the most of adsorbed charges are immobile. However, for weakly
charged surfaces the massive conductivity amplification due to hydrodynamic
slip is impossible in both regimes. Interestingly, in this case the moderate
slip-driven contribution to conductivity can monotonously decrease with the

  with Local Quality Estimates","Accepted by Computer Speech & Language",,,,"cs.CL eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Text-based computational approaches for assessing the quality of
psychotherapy are being developed to support quality assurance and clinical
training. However, due to the long durations of typical conversation based
therapy sessions, and due to limited annotated modeling resources,
computational methods largely rely on frequency-based lexical features or
dialogue acts to assess the overall session level characteristics. In this
work, we propose a hierarchical framework to automatically evaluate the quality
of transcribed Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) interactions. Given the
richly dynamic nature of the spoken dialog within a talk therapy session, to
evaluate the overall session level quality, we propose to consider modeling it
as a function of local variations across the interaction. To implement that
empirically, we divide each psychotherapy session into conversation segments
and initialize the segment-level qualities with the session-level scores.
First, we produce segment embeddings by fine-tuning a BERT-based model, and
predict segment-level (local) quality scores. These embeddings are used as the
lower-level input to a Bidirectional LSTM-based neural network to predict the
session-level (global) quality estimates. In particular, we model the global
quality as a linear function of the local quality scores, which allows us to
update the segment-level quality estimates based on the session-level quality
prediction. These newly estimated segment-level scores benefit the BERT
fine-tuning process, which in turn results in better segment embeddings. We
evaluate the proposed framework on automatically derived transcriptions from
real-world CBT clinical recordings to predict session-level behavior codes. The
results indicate that our approach leads to improved evaluation accuracy for
most codes when used for both regression and classification tasks.

Fock states with a high excitation number. The resonator could be cooled down
via continuous measurements on the ground state of a coupled two-level system

inefficient in the high-temperature regime. Beyond the conventional strategy,
we introduce strong driving between the excited state of the qubit and an
external level. It can remarkably broaden the cooling range in regard to the
non-vanishing populated Fock states of the resonator. Without any precooling
procedure, our strategy allows a significant reduction of the populations over
Fock states with a high excitation number, giving rise to nondeterministic
ground-state cooling after a sequence of measurements. The driving-induced fast
transition constrains the resonator and the ancillary qubit at their ground
state upon measurement and then simulates the quantum Zeno effect. Our protocol
is applied to cool down a high-temperature magnetic resonator. Additionally, it
is generalized to a hybrid cooling protocol by interpolating the methods with
and without strong driving, which can accelerate the cooling process and
increase the overlap between the final state of the resonator and its ground

capable of high-performance computing, while at the same time preserving a low

increasing availability of embedded GPU-based systems, such as the NVIDIA
Jetson series, comprised of an ARM CPU and a NVIDIA Tegra GPU, allows for
massively parallel embedded computing on graphics hardware. With this in mind,
we propose an approach for real-time embedded stereo processing on ARM and

short-ranged due to strong crystal field potential and orbital quenching, we
show that the orbital magnetoelectric response can be remarkably long-ranged in
ferromagnets. In a bilayer consisting of a nonmagnet and a ferromagnet, spin
injection from the interface results in spin accumulation and torque in the
ferromagnet, which rapidly oscillate and decay by spin dephasing. In contrast,
we find that even when an external electric field is applied only on the
nonmagnet, we find substantially long-ranged orbital magnetoelectric response
in the FM, which can go far beyond the spin dephasing length. This unusual
feature is attributed to nearly degenerate orbital characters imposed by the
crystal symmetry, which form hotspots for the intrinsic orbital response.
Because only the states near the hotspots contribute dominantly, the induced
orbital angular momentum does not exhibit destructive interference among states
with different momentum as in the case of the spin dephasing. This gives rise
to a distinct type of orbital torque on the magnetization, increasing with the
thickness of the ferromagnet. Such behavior may serve as critical long-sought
evidence of orbital transport to be directly tested in experiments. Our
findings open the possibility of using long-range orbital magnetoelectric
effect in orbitronic device applications.

numerical algorithm devised specifically for alleviation of the sign problem
appearing in the simulations of quantum many-body systems. In this method, the
sign problem is alleviated by shifting the integration domain for the auxiliary
fields, appearing for example in the conventional determinant quantum Monte
Carlo method, from real space to an appropriate manifold in complex space. Here
we extend this method to quantum spin models with generic two-spin
interactions, by using the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation to decouple the
exchange interactions and the Popov-Fedotov transformation to map the quantum
spins to complex fermions. As a demonstration, we apply the method to the
Kitaev model in a magnetic field whose ground state is predicted to deliver a
topological quantum spin liquid with non-Abelian anyonic excitations. To
illustrate how the sign problem is alleviated in this method, we visualize the
asymptotic Lefschetz thimbles in complex space, together with the saddle points
and the zeros of the fermion determinant. We benchmark our method in the
low-temperature region in a magnetic field and show that the sign of the action
is recovered considerably and unbiased numerical results are obtained with
sufficient precision.

remarkable success of word embeddings for this purpose suggests that
high-quality representations can be obtained by summarizing the sentence
contexts of word mentions. In this paper, we propose a method for learning word
representations that follows this basic strategy, but differs from standard
word embeddings in two important ways. First, we take advantage of
contextualized language models (CLMs) rather than bags of word vectors to
encode contexts. Second, rather than learning a word vector directly, we use a
topic model to partition the contexts in which words appear, and then learn
different topic-specific vectors for each word. Finally, we use a task-specific
supervision signal to make a soft selection of the resulting vectors. We show
that this simple strategy leads to high-quality word vectors, which are more
predictive of semantic properties than word embeddings and existing CLM-based
strategies.

the visual cortex, i.e., retinotopic map, is an essential topic in vision
science and neuroscience. Human retinotopic maps can be revealed by analyzing
the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal responses to designed
visual stimuli in vivo. Neurophysiology studies summarized that visual areas
are topological (i.e., nearby neurons have receptive fields at nearby locations
in the image). However, conventional fMRI-based analyses frequently generate
non-topological results because they process fMRI signals on a voxel-wise
basis, without considering the neighbor relations on the surface. Here we
propose a topological receptive field (tRF) model which imposes the topological
condition when decoding retinotopic fMRI signals. More specifically, we
parametrized the cortical surface to a unit disk, characterized the topological
condition by tRF, and employed an efficient scheme to solve the tRF model. We
tested our framework on both synthetic and human fMRI data. Experimental
results showed that the tRF model could remove the topological violations,
improve model explaining power, and generate biologically plausible retinotopic

practical spintronics applications. Recently, 1T phase CrTe2 (1T-CrTe2)
nanosheets with five and thicker layers have been successfully synthesized,
which all exhibit the properties of ferromagnetic (FM) metals with Curie
temperatures around 305 K. However, whether the ferromagnetism therein can be
maintained when continuously reducing the nanosheet's thickness to monolayer
limit remains unknown. Here, through first-principles calculations, we explore
the evolution of magnetic properties of 1 to 6 layers CrTe2 nanosheets and
several interesting points are found: First, unexpectedly, monolayer CrTe2
prefers a zigzag antiferromagnetic (AFM) state with its energy much lower than
that of FM state. Second, in 2 to 4 layers CrTe2, both the intralayer and
interlayer magnetic coupling are AFM. Last, when the number of layers is equal
to or greater than five, the intralayer and interlayer magnetic coupling become
FM. Theoretical analysis reveals that the in-plane lattice contraction of few
layer CrTe2 compared to bulk is the main factor producing intralayer AFM-FM
magnetic transition. At the same time, as long as the intralayer coupling gets
FM, the interlayer coupling will concomitantly switch from AFM to FM. Such
highly thickness dependent magnetism provides a new perspective to control the

learning for Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). Specifically,
attention has been given to sequential learning models, due to their ability to
extract the temporal characteristics of Network traffic Flows (NetFlows), and
use them for NIDS tasks. However, the applications of these sequential models
often consist of transferring and adapting methodologies directly from other
fields, without an in-depth investigation on how to leverage the specific
circumstances of cybersecurity scenarios; moreover, there is a lack of
comprehensive studies on sequential models that rely on NetFlow data, which
presents significant advantages over traditional full packet captures. We
tackle this problem in this paper. We propose a detailed methodology to extract
temporal sequences of NetFlows that denote patterns of malicious activities.
Then, we apply this methodology to compare the efficacy of sequential learning
models against traditional static learning models. In particular, we perform a
fair comparison of a `sequential' Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) against a
`static' Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) in distinct environments represented
by two well-known datasets for NIDS: the CICIDS2017 and the CTU13. Our results
highlight that LSTM achieves comparable performance to FNN in the CICIDS2017

with 95.7\% F1-score against 91.5\%. This paper thus paves the way to future

than PDEs) in two cases: the case of finite energy initial data and a more
general case where the initial data are a short range perturbation of a
periodic function. In the second case, inspired by rigorous results on the Toda

something somewhat more complicated: a short range perturbation of a periodic

from regions of (asymptotically) pure periodicity and regions of solitons in a
periodic background, we also observe ""modulated"" regions of fast oscillations
with slowly varying parameters like amplitude and phase. We have conducted some
numerical calculations to investigate if this trichotomy (pure periodicity +
solitons + modulated oscillations) persists for any discrete lattices of the

description of small-scale fading effects in emerging wireless networks.
However, its current statistical characterization has several fundamental
issues. Primarily, conventional TWDP parameterization is not in accordance with
the model's underlying physical mechanisms. In addition, available TWDP
expressions for PDF, CDF, and MGF are given either in integral or approximate
forms, or as mathematically untractable closed-form expressions. Consequently,
the existing TWDP statistical characterization does not allow accurate
evaluation of system performance (such as error and outage probability) in all
fading conditions for most modulation and diversity techniques. In this paper,
the existing statistical characterization of the TWDP fading model is improved
by overcoming some of the noticed issues. In this regard, physically justified
TWDP parameterization is proposed and used for further calculations.
Additionally, exact infinite-series PDF and CDF are introduced. Based on these
expressions, the exact MGF of the SNR is derived in form suitable for
mathematical manipulations. The applicability of the proposed MGF for
derivation of the exact average symbol error probability (ASEP) is demonstrated
with the example of M-ary PSK modulation. Therefore, in this paper, M-ary PSK
ASEP is derived as an explicit expression for the first time in the literature.
The derived expression is further simplified for large SNR values in order to
obtain a closed-form asymptotic ASEP, which is shown to be applicable for SNR >
20 dB. All proposed expressions are verified by Monte Carlo simulation in a
variety of TWDP fading conditions.

while evading detection. In this paper, instead of focusing on the detection of
stealthy attacks, we aim to provide early warnings to operators, in order to
avoid physical damage and preserve in advance data that may serve as an
evidence during an investigation. We propose a framework to provide grounds for
suspicion, i.e. preliminary indicators reflecting the likelihood of success of
a stealthy attack. We propose two grounds for suspicion based on the behaviour
of the physical process: (i) feasibility of a stealthy attack, and (ii)
proximity to unsafe operating regions. We propose a metric to measure grounds
for suspicion in real-time and provide soundness principles to ensure that such
a metric is consistent with the grounds for suspicion. We apply our framework
to Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems and formulate the suspicion metric
computation as a real-time reachability problem. We validate our framework on a
case study involving the benchmark Tennessee-Eastman process. We show through
numerical simulation that we can provide early warnings well before a potential
stealthy attack can cause damage, while incurring minimal load on the network.
Finally, we apply our framework on a use case to illustrate its usefulness in
supporting early evidence collection.

efforts have focused on the study of the micro- and macro-scale viscoelasticity
related to bone damage and healing based on creep, mineralized collagen has not
been explored on a molecular level. We report a study that aims at
systematically exploring the viscoelasticity of collagenous fibrils with
different mineralization levels. We investigate the dynamic mechanical response
upon cyclic and impulsive loads to observe the viscoelastic phenomena from
either shear or extensional strains via molecular dynamics. We perform a
sensitivity analysis with several key benchmarks: intrafibrillar mineralization
percentage, hydration state, and external load amplitude. Our results show a
growth of the dynamic moduli with an increase of mineral percentage, pronounced
at low strains. When intrafibrillar water is present, the material softens the
elastic component but considerably increases its viscosity, especially at high
frequencies. This behaviour is confirmed from the material response upon
impulsive loads, in which water drastically reduces the relaxation times
throughout the input velocity range by one order of magnitude, with respect to
the dehydrated counterparts. We find that upon transient loads, water has a
major impact on the mechanics of mineralized fibrillar collagen, being able to
improve the capability of the tissue to passively and effectively dissipate
energy, especially after fast and high-amplitude external loads.

practical WET-enabled mMTC. However, because it is common that the terminals
appear spatially clustered, some degree of spatial correlation between their
channels to the base station (BS) is expected to occur. The paper considers a
massive antenna array at the BS for WET that only has access to i) the first
and second order statistics of the Rician channel component of the
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel and also to ii) the line-of-sight
MIMO component. The optimal precoding scheme that maximizes the total energy
available to the single-antenna devices is derived considering a continuous
alphabet for the precoders, permitting any modulated or deterministic waveform.
This may lead to some devices in the clusters being assigned a low fraction of
the total available power in the cluster, creating a rather uneven situation
among them. Consequently, a fairness criterion is introduced, imposing a
minimum amount of power allocated to the terminals. A piece-wise linear
harvesting circuit is considered at the terminals, with both saturation and a
minimum sensitivity, and a constrained version of the precoder is also proposed
by solving a non-linear programming problem. A paramount benefit of the
constrained precoder is the encompassment of fairness in the power allocation

requirements is client-side compression with a lossy codec such as Opus.
However, this compression can have a detrimental effect especially on
multi-channel ASR front-ends, due to the distortion and loss of spatial
information introduced by the codec. In this publication, we propose an
improved approach for the compression of microphone array signals based on
Opus, using a modified joint channel coding approach and additionally
introducing a multi-channel spatial decorrelating transform to reduce

approach on the spatial information retained in multi-channel signals after
compression, and evaluate the performance on far-field ASR with a multi-channel

rise and is a promising technology envisioned to aid in 6G and beyond wireless

electromagnetic elements enabling some sort of control over the wireless
channel. In this paper, the potential of RIS technology is explored to perform
a sort of virtual equalization over-the-air for frequency-selective channels
whereas, equalization is generally conducted at either the transmitter or
receiver in conventional communication systems. Specifically, with the aid of
an RIS, the frequency-selective channel from the transmitter to the RIS is
transformed to a frequency-flat channel through elimination of inter-symbol
interference (ISI) components at the receiver. ISI is eliminated by adjusting
the phases of impinging signals particularly to maximize the incoming signal of
the strongest tap. First, a general end-to-end system model is provided and a
continuous to discrete-time signal model is presented. Subsequently, a
probabilistic analysis for the elimination of ISI terms is conducted and
reinforced with computer simulations. Furthermore, a theoretical error
probability analysis is performed along with computer simulations. It is
analyzed and demonstrated that conventional RIS phase alignment methods, can
successfully eliminate ISI and the RIS-aided communication channel can be
converted from frequency-selective to frequency-flat.

candidate topological and triplet-paired superconductor, has aroused widespread
interest. However, to date, there is no consensus on whether the stoichiometric
sample of UTe2 is superconducting or not due to lack of reliable evidence to
distinguish the difference between the nominal and real compositions of
samples. Here, we are the first to clarify that the stoichiometric UT2 is
non-superconducting at ambient pressure and under hydrostatic pressure up to 6
GPa, however we find that it can be compressed into superconductivity by
application of quasi-uniaxial pressure. Measurements of resistivity,
magnetoresistance and susceptibility reveal that the quasi-uniaxial pressure
results in a suppression of the Kondo coherent state seen at ambient pressure,
and then leads to a superconductivity initially emerged on the ab-plane at 1.5
GPa. At 4.8 GPa, the superconductivity is developed in three crystallographic
directions. The superconducting state coexists with an exotic magnetic ordered
state that develops just below the onset temperature of the superconducting
transition. The discovery of the quasi-uniaxial-pressure-induced
superconductivity with exotic magnetic state in the stoichiometric UTe2 not
only provide new understandings on this compound, but also highlight the vital
role of Te deficiency in developing the superconductivity at ambient pressures.

vulnerable to various attacks that cheat the models by manipulating the digital
counterparts of human faces. So far, lots of liveness detection schemes have
been developed to prevent such attacks. Unfortunately, the attacker can still
bypass these schemes by constructing wide-ranging sophisticated attacks. We
study the security of existing face authentication services (e.g., Microsoft,
Amazon, and Face++) and typical liveness detection approaches. Particularly, we
develop a new type of attack, i.e., the low-cost 3D projection attack that
projects manipulated face videos on a 3D face model, which can easily evade
these face authentication services and liveness detection approaches. To this
end, we propose FaceLip, a novel liveness detection scheme for face
authentication, which utilizes unforgeable lip motion patterns built upon
well-designed acoustic signals to enable a strong security guarantee. The
unique lip motion patterns for each user are unforgeable because FaceLip
verifies the patterns by capturing and analyzing the acoustic signals that are
dynamically generated according to random challenges, which ensures that our
signals for liveness detection cannot be manipulated. Specially, we develop
robust algorithms for FaceLip to eliminate the impact of noisy signals in the
environment and thus can accurately infer the lip motions at larger distances.
We prototype FaceLip on off-the-shelf smartphones and conduct extensive
experiments under different settings. Our evaluation with 44 participants

composition.We analyze here a sample of OCs located within about 2 kpc from the
Sun, with ages from about 50 Myr to a few Gyr.We used HARPS-N at the Telescopio
Nazionale Gaileo and collected very high-resolution spectra (R = 115\,000) of
40 red giant/red clump stars in 18 OCs (16 never or scarcely studied plus two
comparison clusters). We measured their radial velocities and derived the
stellar parameters.We discussed the relationship between metallicity and
Galactocentric distance, adding literature data to our results to enlarge the
sample and taking also age into account. We compared the result of
observational data with that from chemo-dynamical models. These models
generally reproduce the metallicity gradient well. However, at young ages we
found a large dispersion in metallicity, not reproduced by models. Several
possible explanations are explored, including uncertainties in the derived
metallicity. We confirm the difficulties in determining parameters for young
stars (age < 200 Myr), due to a combination of intrinsic factors which
atmospheric models can not easily reproduce and which affect the parameters
uncertainty

first-principle-models come to their limits. Aerodynamic effects, while
insignificant at low speeds, become the dominant model defect during high
speeds or agile maneuvers. Accurate modeling is needed to design robust
high-performance control systems and enable flying close to the platform's
physical limits. We propose a hybrid approach fusing first principles and
learning to model quadrotors and their aerodynamic effects with unprecedented
accuracy. First principles fail to capture such aerodynamic effects, rendering
traditional approaches inaccurate when used for simulation or controller
tuning. Data-driven approaches try to capture aerodynamic effects with blackbox
modeling, such as neural networks; however, they struggle to robustly
generalize to arbitrary flight conditions. Our hybrid approach unifies and
outperforms both first-principles blade-element theory and learned residual
dynamics. It is evaluated in one of the world's largest motion-capture systems,
using autonomous-quadrotor-flight data at speeds up to 65km/h. The resulting
model captures the aerodynamic thrust, torques, and parasitic effects with
astonishing accuracy, outperforming existing models with 50% reduced prediction
errors, and shows strong generalization capabilities beyond the training set.

exemplar-based colorization model with unsupervised and unpaired training
manner. Current algorithms usually strive to achieve two procedures: i)
retrieving a large number of reference images with high similarity for
preparing training dataset, which is inevitably time-consuming and tedious; ii)
designing complicated modules to transfer the colors of the reference image to
the target image, by calculating and leveraging the deep semantic
correspondence between them (e.g., non-local operation), which is
computationally expensive during testing. Contrary to the previous methods, we
adopt a self-augmented self-reference learning scheme, where the reference
image is generated by graphical transformations from the original colorful one
whereby the training can be formulated in a paired manner. Second, in order to
reduce the process time, our method explicitly extracts the color embeddings
and exploits a progressive style feature Transformation network, which injects
the color embeddings into the reconstruction of the final image. Such design is
much more lightweight and intelligible, achieving appealing performance with
fast processing speed.

  We investigate whether one can explain the behavior of neural ranking models

this axiomatic thinking to reproduce rankings based on combinations of
elementary constraints. This allows us to investigate to what extent the
ranking decisions of neural rankers can be explained in terms of retrieval
axioms, and which axioms apply in which situations. Our experimental study
considers a comprehensive set of axioms over several representative neural
rankers. While the existing axioms can already explain the particularly
confident ranking decisions rather well, future work should extend the axiom
set to also cover the other still ""unexplainable"" neural IR rank decisions.

the way it effects the movement of data around the machine, and the increased

on modeling the bandwidth requirements of an application on a NUMA compute node

measured frequency profiles of HWP properties (used in the mapmaking stage of
the pipeline) and the actual profiles (used in the sky-scanning step). We
simulated single-frequency, CMB-only observations to emphasize the effects of
non-idealities on the BB power spectrum. We also considered multi-frequency
observations to account for the frequency dependence of HWP properties and the
contribution of foreground emission. We quantified the systematic effects in
terms of a bias $\Delta r$ on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, with respect to
the ideal case without systematic effects. We derived the accuracy requirements
on the measurements of HWP properties by requiring $\Delta r < 10^{-5}$ (1% of

agents balance accepting a proposed match with the cost of continuing their
search? We consider this problem in a discrete setting, in which agents have
cardinal values and finite lifetimes, and proposed matches are random.
  We seek to quantify how well the agents can do. We provide upper and lower
bounds on the collective losses of the agents, with a polynomially small
failure probability, where the notion of loss is with respect to a plausible
baseline we define. These bounds are tight up to constant factors.
  We highlight two aspects of this work. First, in our model, agents have a
finite time in which to enjoy their matches, namely the minimum of their
remaining lifetime and that of their partner; this implies that unmatched
agents become less desirable over time, and suggests that their decision rules
should change over time. Second, we use a discrete rather than a continuum

scientific visualization technique that simulates light transport with objects'
matter using physically-based lighting models. Monte Carlo (MC) path tracing is
often used with surface models, yet its application for volumetric models is
difficult due to the complexity of integrating MC light-paths in volumetric
media with none or smooth material boundaries. Moreover, auxiliary
geometry-buffers (G-buffers) produced for volumes are typically very noisy,
failing to guide image denoisers relying on that information to preserve image
details. This makes existing real-time denoisers, which take noise-free
G-buffers as their input, less effective when denoising VPT images. We propose
the necessary modifications to an image-based denoiser previously used when
rendering surface models, and demonstrate effective denoising of VPT images. In
particular, our denoising exploits temporal coherence between frames, without
relying on noise-free G-buffers, which has been a common assumption of existing
denoisers for surface-models. Our technique preserves high-frequency details
through a weighted recursive least squares that handles heterogeneous noise for
volumetric models. We show for various real data sets that our method improves
the visual fidelity and temporal stability of VPT during classic DVR operations
such as camera movements, modifications of the light sources, and editions to
the volume transfer function.

such as how desirable, plausible, or feasible they are. Modality is important
for many NLP downstream tasks such as the detection of hedging, uncertainty,
speculation, and more. Previous studies that address modality detection in NLP
often restrict modal expressions to a closed syntactic class, and the modal
sense labels are vastly different across different studies, lacking an accepted
standard. Furthermore, these senses are often analyzed independently of the
events that they modify. This work builds on the theoretical foundations of the
Georgetown Gradable Modal Expressions (GME) work by Rubinstein et al. (2013) to
propose an event-based modality detection task where modal expressions can be
words of any syntactic class and sense labels are drawn from a comprehensive
taxonomy which harmonizes the modal concepts contributed by the different
studies. We present experiments on the GME corpus aiming to detect and classify
fine-grained modal concepts and associate them with their modified events. We
show that detecting and classifying modal expressions is not only feasible, but
also improves the detection of modal events in their own right.

curvature radiation momentum components perpendicular to the local magnetic

value for single-photon conversion to pairs is high but is possibly reached in

existence of coherent radio emission in millisecond pulsars is assumed to need
a high-multiplicity pair plasma, then it follows that the primary electrons
also produce gamma-rays in the Fermi-LAT energy band for which the

applications including imaging modalities such as MRI and magnetic particle
imaging (MPI). The latter one exploits the non-linear magnetization response of
a large ensemble of magnetic nanoparticles to magnetic fields which allows
determining the spatial distribution of the MNP concentration from measured
voltage signals. Currently, modeling the voltage signals of large ensembles of
MNPs in an MPI environment is not yet accurately possible, especially for
liquid tracers in multi-dimensional magnetic excitation fields. Thus, the
voltage-to-image mapping is still obtained in a time consuming calibration
procedure. While the ferrofluidic case can be seen as the typical setting, more
recently immobilized and potentially oriented MNPs have received considerable
attention. By aligning the particles during immobilization, one can encode the
angle of the easy axis into the magnetization response providing a
sophisticated benchmark system for model-based approaches. In this work, we
address the modeling problem for immobilized, oriented MNPs in the context of
MPI. We investigate a model-based approach where the magnetization response is
simulated by a N\'eel rotation model for the particle's magnetic moments and
the ensemble magnetization is obtained by solving a Fokker-Planck equation
approach. Since the parameters of the model are a-priori unknown, we
investigate different methods for performing a parameter identification and
discuss two models: One where a single function vector is used from the space
spanned by the model parameters and another where a superposition of function
vectors is considered. We show that our model can much more accurately
reproduce the orientation dependent signal response when compared to the
equilibrium model, which marks the current state-of-the-art for model-based
system matrix simulations in MPI.

reinforcement learning (RL), theoretical understanding of why and when it works
remains limited. This paper presents analyses for the statistical benefit of
multitask representation learning in linear Markov Decision Process (MDP) under
a generative model. In this paper, we consider an agent to learn a
representation function $\phi$ out of a function class $\Phi$ from $T$ source
tasks with $N$ data per task, and then use the learned $\hat{\phi}$ to reduce
the required number of sample for a new task. We first discover a
\emph{Least-Activated-Feature-Abundance} (LAFA) criterion, denoted as $\kappa$,
with which we prove that a straightforward least-square algorithm learns a
policy which is $\tilde{O}(H^2\sqrt{\frac{\mathcal{C}(\Phi)^2 \kappa
d}{NT}+\frac{\kappa d}{n}})$ sub-optimal. Here $H$ is the planning horizon,
$\mathcal{C}(\Phi)$ is $\Phi$'s complexity measure, $d$ is the dimension of the
representation (usually $d\ll \mathcal{C}(\Phi)$) and $n$ is the number of
samples for the new task. Thus the required $n$ is $O(\kappa d H^4)$ for the
sub-optimality to be close to zero, which is much smaller than
$O(\mathcal{C}(\Phi)^2\kappa d H^4)$ in the setting without multitask
representation learning, whose sub-optimality gap is
$\tilde{O}(H^2\sqrt{\frac{\kappa \mathcal{C}(\Phi)^2d}{n}})$. This
theoretically explains the power of multitask representation learning in
reducing sample complexity. Further, we note that to ensure high sample
efficiency, the LAFA criterion $\kappa$ should be small. In fact, $\kappa$
varies widely in magnitude depending on the different sampling distribution for
new task. This indicates adaptive sampling technique is important to make
$\kappa$ solely depend on $d$. Finally, we provide empirical results of a noisy
grid-world environment to corroborate our theoretical findings.

models have received a lot of attention. Often explanations are given in form
of model simplifications or visualizations. However, as shown in cognitive
science as well as in early AI research, concept understanding can also be
improved by the alignment of a given instance for a concept with a similar
counterexample. Contrasting a given instance with a structurally similar
example which does not belong to the concept highlights what characteristics
are necessary for concept membership. Such near misses have been proposed by
Winston (1970) as efficient guidance for learning in relational domains. We
introduce an explanation generation algorithm for relational concepts learned
with Inductive Logic Programming (\textsc{GeNME}). The algorithm identifies
near miss examples from a given set of instances and ranks these examples by
their degree of closeness to a specific positive instance. A modified rule
which covers the near miss but not the original instance is given as an
explanation. We illustrate \textsc{GeNME} with the well known family domain
consisting of kinship relations, the visual relational Winston arches domain
and a real-world domain dealing with file management. We also present a
psychological experiment comparing human preferences of rule-based,

inherently stochastic. Each reaction channel contributes to this stochasticity
in different measure. In this paper we study the stochastic dynamics of protein
interaction networks (PIN) that are made up of monomers and dimers. The network
is defined by the dimers, which are formed by hybridizing two monomers. The
size of a PIN was defined as the number of monomers that interacts with at
least one other monomer (including itself). We generated 4200 random PIN of
sizes between 2 and 8 (600 per size) and simulated via the Gillespie algorithm
the stochastic evolution of copy numbers of all monomers and dimers until they
reached a steady state. The simulations revealed that the Fano factors of both
monomers and dimers in all networks and for all time points were close to one,
either from below or above. Only 10% of Fano factors for monomers were above
1.3 and 10% of Fano factors for dimers were above 1.17, with 5.54 and 3.47 as
the maximum value recorded for monomers and dimers, respectively. These
findings suggests that PIN in real biological setting contribute to the overall
stochastic noise that is close to Poisson. Our results also show a correlation
between stochastic noise, network size and network connectivity: for monomers,
the Fano factors tend towards 1 from above, while the Fano factors for dimers
tend towards 1 from below. For monomers, this tendency is amplified with
increased network connectivity.

order - is critical to rapid learning and effective pedagogy. Yet in machine
learning, curricula are not widely used and empirically often yield only
moderate benefits. This stark difference in the importance of curriculum raises
a fundamental theoretical question: when and why does curriculum learning help?
  In this work, we analyse a prototypical neural network model of curriculum
learning in the high-dimensional limit, employing statistical physics methods.
Curricula could in principle change both the learning speed and asymptotic
performance of a model. To study the former, we provide an exact description of
the online learning setting, confirming the long-standing experimental
observation that curricula can modestly speed up learning. To study the latter,
we derive performance in a batch learning setting, in which a network trains to
convergence in successive phases of learning on dataset slices of varying
difficulty. With standard training losses, curriculum does not provide
generalisation benefit, in line with empirical observations. However, we show
that by connecting different learning phases through simple Gaussian priors,
curriculum can yield a large improvement in test performance. Taken together,
our reduced analytical descriptions help reconcile apparently conflicting
empirical results and trace regimes where curriculum learning yields the
largest gains. More broadly, our results suggest that fully exploiting a
curriculum may require explicit changes to the loss function at curriculum
boundaries.

  https://github.com/vision4robotics/MSCF-tracker",,,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based visual tracking has been confronted with
numerous challenges, e.g., object motion and occlusion. These challenges
generally introduce unexpected mutations of target appearance and result in
tracking failure. However, prevalent discriminative correlation filter (DCF)
based trackers are insensitive to target mutations due to a predefined label,
which concentrates on merely the centre of the training region. Meanwhile,
appearance mutations caused by occlusion or similar objects usually lead to the
inevitable learning of wrong information. To cope with appearance mutations,
this paper proposes a novel DCF-based method to enhance the sensitivity and
resistance to mutations with an adaptive hybrid label, i.e., MSCF. The ideal
label is optimized jointly with the correlation filter and remains temporal
consistency. Besides, a novel measurement of mutations called mutation threat
factor (MTF) is applied to correct the label dynamically. Considerable
experiments are conducted on widely used UAV benchmarks. The results indicate
that the performance of MSCF tracker surpasses other 26 state-of-the-art
DCF-based and deep-based trackers. With a real-time speed of _38 frames/s, the
proposed approach is sufficient for UAV tracking commissions.

widespread application. To overcome this, we explore the use of interpretable,
measurable and computer-aided features extracted from plant leaf images. Image
processing is one of the most challenging, and crucial steps in
feature-extraction. The purpose of image processing is to improve the leaf
image by removing undesired distortion. The main image processing steps of our
algorithm involves: i) Convert original image to RGB (Red-Green-Blue) image,
ii) Gray scaling, iii) Gaussian smoothing, iv) Binary thresholding, v) Remove
stalk, vi) Closing holes, and vii) Resize image. The next step after image
processing is to extract features from plant leaf images. We introduced 52
computationally efficient features to classify plant species. These features
are mainly classified into four groups as: i) shape-based features, ii)
color-based features, iii) texture-based features, and iv) scagnostic features.
Length, width, area, texture correlation, monotonicity and scagnostics are to
name few of them. We explore the ability of features to discriminate the
classes of interest under supervised learning and unsupervised learning
settings. For that, supervised dimensionality reduction technique, Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and unsupervised dimensionality reduction
technique, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are used to convert and visualize
the images from digital-image space to feature space. The results show that the
features are sufficient to discriminate the classes of interest under both

simulating epidemic dynamics. In a metapopulation model, one considers a
network composed of subpopulations and their pairwise connections, and
individuals are assumed to migrate from one subpopulation to another obeying a
given mobility rule. While how different mobility rules affect epidemic
dynamics in metapopulation models has been studied, there have been relatively
few efforts on comparison of the effects of simple (i.e., unbiased) random
walks and more complex mobility rules. Here we study a
susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) dynamics in a metapopulation model, in
which individuals obey a parametric second-order random-walk mobility rule
called the node2vec. We map the second-order mobility rule of the node2vec to a
first-order random walk in a network whose each node is a directed edge
connecting a pair of subpopulations and then derive the epidemic threshold. For
various networks, we find that the epidemic threshold is large (therefore,
epidemic spreading tends to be suppressed) when the individuals infrequently
backtrack or infrequently visit the common neighbors of the currently visited
and the last visited subpopulations than when the individuals obey the simple
random walk. The amount of change in the epidemic threshold induced by the
node2vec mobility is in general not as large as, but is sometimes comparable
with, the one induced by the change in the diffusion rate for individuals.

show that it is a generic property too. In particular, the sparsity constraint

'catastrophic forgetting' whereby performance on previous tasks deteriorates
rapidly as new ones are acquired. This shortcoming has recently been addressed
using methods that encourage parameters to stay close to those used for
previous tasks. This can be done by (i) using specific parameter regularizers
that map out suitable destinations in parameter space, or (ii) guiding the
optimization journey by projecting gradients into subspaces that do not
interfere with previous tasks. However, these methods often exhibit subpar
performance in both feedforward and recurrent neural networks, with recurrent

performance on all tasks at convergence and combines this with gradient
projection using the prior precision, which prevents catastrophic forgetting
during optimization. Our method outperforms both standard weight regularization
techniques and projection based approaches when applied to continual learning
problems in feedforward and recurrent networks. Finally, the trained networks
evolve task-specific dynamics that are strongly preserved as new tasks are

random finite set (RFS) type multi-object densities (MODs). Existing fusion
methods use scalar weights to characterize the relative information confidence
among the local MODs, and in this way the portion of contribution of each local
MOD to the fused global MOD can be tuned via adjusting these weights. Our
analysis shows that the fusion mechanism of using a scalar coefficient can be
oversimplified for practical scenarios, as the information confidence of an MOD
is complex and usually space-varying due to the imperfection of sensor ability
and the various impacts from surveillance environment. Consequently, severe
fusion performance degradation can be observed when these scalar weights fail
to reflect the actual situation. We make two contributions towards addressing
this problem. Firstly, we propose a novel heterogeneous fusion method to
perform the information averaging among local RFS MODs. By factorizing each
local MODs into a number of smaller size sub-MODs, it can transform the
original complicated fusion problem into a much easier parallelizable
multi-cluster fusion problem. Secondly, as the proposed fusion strategy is a
general procedure without any particular model assumptions, we further derive
the detailed heterogeneous fusion equations, with centralized network
architecture, for both the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter and the
multi-Bernoulli (MB) filter. The Gaussian mixture implementations of the
proposed fusion algorithms are also presented. Various numerical experiments

two-body losses. In this dissipative quantum Zeno regime, the gas fermionises
and its dynamics can be described with a simple set of rate equations.
Employing the local density approximation and a Boltzmann-like dynamical
equation, the description is easily extended to take into account an external
potential. We show that in the absence of confinement the population is
depleted in an anomalous way and that the gas behaves as a low-temperature
classical gas. The harmonic confinement accelerates the depopulation of the gas
and introduces a novel decay regime, which we thoroughly characterise.

established to solve the location siting problems for macro and micro fire

is an emerging problem in recent years. For instance, pre-trained models may be
stolen or abuse by illegal users without the authorization of the model owner.
Recently, many works on protecting the intellectual property of DNN models have
been proposed. In these works, embedding watermarks into DNN based on backdoor
is one of the widely used methods. However, when the DNN model is stolen, the
backdoor-based watermark may face the risk of being detected and removed by an
adversary. In this paper, we propose a scheme to detect and remove watermark in
deep neural networks via generative adversarial networks (GAN). We demonstrate
that the backdoor-based DNN watermarks are vulnerable to the proposed GAN-based
watermark removal attack. The proposed attack method includes two phases. In
the first phase, we use the GAN and few clean images to detect and reverse the
watermark in the DNN model. In the second phase, we fine-tune the watermarked
DNN based on the reversed backdoor images. Experimental evaluations on the
MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets demonstrate that, the proposed method can
effectively remove about 98% of the watermark in DNN models, as the watermark
retention rate reduces from 100% to less than 2% after applying the proposed
attack. In the meantime, the proposed attack hardly affects the model's
performance. The test accuracy of the watermarked DNN on the MNIST and the
CIFAR10 datasets drops by less than 1% and 3%, respectively.

redundant features and the stability selection approach fails at selecting
enough relevant features for achieving acceptable predictive accuracy. For our

from space. But the challenging imaging conditions when observing the Earth
from space push stereo matching to its limits. In practice, the resulting
digital surface models (DSMs) are fairly noisy and often do not attain the
accuracy needed for high-resolution applications such as 3D city modeling.
Arguably, stereo correspondence based on low-level image similarity is
insufficient and should be complemented with a-priori knowledge about the
expected surface geometry beyond basic local smoothness. To that end, we
introduce ResDepth, a convolutional neural network that learns such an
expressive geometric prior from example data. ResDepth refines an initial, raw
stereo DSM while conditioning the refinement on the images. I.e., it acts as a
smart, learned post-processing filter and can seamlessly complement any stereo
matching pipeline. In a series of experiments, we find that the proposed method
consistently improves stereo DSMs both quantitatively and qualitatively. We
show that the prior encoded in the network weights captures meaningful
geometric characteristics of urban design, which also generalize across
different districts and even from one city to another. Moreover, we demonstrate
that, by training on a variety of stereo pairs, ResDepth can acquire a
sufficient degree of invariance against variations in imaging conditions and

efficient Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocol of hundreds of replicas is
desirable. Although the throughput of existing leader-based BFT protocols has
reached a high level of $10^5$ requests per second for a small scale of
replicas, it drops significantly when the number of replicas increases, which
leads to a lack of practicality. This paper focuses on the scalability of BFT
protocols and identifies a major bottleneck to leader-based BFT protocols due
to the excessive workload of the leader at large scales. A new metric of
scaling factor is defined to capture whether a BFT protocol will get stuck when
it scales out, which can be used to measure the performance of efficiency and
scalability of BFT protocols. We propose ""Leopard"", the first leader-based BFT
protocol that scales to multiple hundreds of replicas, and more importantly,
preserves a high efficiency. We remove the bottleneck by introducing a
technique of achieving a constant scaling factor, which takes full advantage of
the idle resource and adaptively balances the workload of the leader among all
replicas. We implement Leopard and evaluate its performance compared to
HotStuff, the state-of-the-art BFT protocol. We run extensive experiments on
the two systems with up to 600 replicas. The results show that Leopard achieves
significant performance improvements both on throughput and scalability. In
particular, the throughput of Leopard remains at a high level of $10^5$ when
the system scales out to 600 replicas. It achieves a $5\times$ throughput over
HotStuff when the scale is 300 (which is already the largest scale we can see
the progress of the latter in our experiments), and the gap becomes wider as
the number of replicas further increases.

inference is deep learning, and particularly Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs),
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and transformer Self-Attention models.
This thesis investigates the use of deep learning for novel semantic
representation and inference, and makes contributions in the following three
areas: creating training data, improving semantic representations and extending
inference learning. In terms of creating training data, we contribute the
largest publicly available dataset of real-life factual claims for the purpose
of automatic claim verification (MultiFC), and we present a novel inference
model composed of multi-scale CNNs with different kernel sizes that learn from
external sources to infer fact checking labels. In terms of improving semantic
representations, we contribute a novel model that captures non-compositional
semantic indicators. By definition, the meaning of a non-compositional phrase
cannot be inferred from the individual meanings of its composing words (e.g.,
hot dog). Motivated by this, we operationalize the compositionality of a phrase
contextually by enriching the phrase representation with external word
embeddings and knowledge graphs. Finally, in terms of inference learning, we
propose a series of novel deep learning architectures that improve inference by
using syntactic dependencies, by ensembling role guided attention heads,
incorporating gating layers, and concatenating multiple heads in novel and
effective ways. This thesis consists of seven publications (five published and

Syndrome (OQDS) outbreak, due to the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa. In a couple
of previous papers, the authors have proposed a mathematical approach for
identifying possible control strategies for eliminating or at least reduce the
economic impact of such event. The main players involved in OQDS are
represented by the insect vector, Philaenus spumarius, its host plants (olive
trees and weeds) and the bacterium, X. fastidiosa. A basic mathematical model
has been expressed in terms of a system of ordinary differential equations; a
preliminary analysis already provided interesting results about possible
control strategies within an integrated pest management framework, not
requiring the removal of the productive resource represented by the olive
trees. The same conjectures have been later confirmed by analyzing the impact
of possible spatial heterogeneities on controlling a X. fastidiosa epidemic.
These encouraging facts have stimulated a more detailed and rigorous
mathematical analysis of the same system, as presented in this paper. A clear
picture of the possible steady states (equilibria) and their stability
properties has been outlined, within a variety of different parameter
scenarios, for the original spatially homogeneous ecosystem. The results
obtained here confirm, in a mathematically rigorous way, what had been
conjectured in the previous papers, i.e. that the removal of a suitable amount
of weed biomass (reservoir of the juvenile stages of the insect vector of X.
fastidiosa from olive orchards and surrounding areas is the most acceptable
strategy to control the spread of the OQDS. In addition, as expected, the
adoption of more resistant olive tree cultivars has been shown to be a good
strategy, though less cost-effective, in controlling the pathogen.

  Translation","Computational Linguistics Journal",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) has achieved notable
results in various translation tasks. However, the word-by-word generation
manner determined by the autoregressive mechanism leads to high translation
latency of the NMT and restricts its low-latency applications.
Non-Autoregressive Neural Machine Translation (NAT) removes the autoregressive
mechanism and achieves significant decoding speedup through generating target
words independently and simultaneously. Nevertheless, NAT still takes the
word-level cross-entropy loss as the training objective, which is not optimal
because the output of NAT cannot be properly evaluated due to the multimodality
problem. In this article, we propose using sequence-level training objectives
to train NAT models, which evaluate the NAT outputs as a whole and correlates
well with the real translation quality. Firstly, we propose training NAT models
to optimize sequence-level evaluation metrics (e.g., BLEU) based on several
novel reinforcement algorithms customized for NAT, which outperforms the
conventional method by reducing the variance of gradient estimation. Secondly,
we introduce a novel training objective for NAT models, which aims to minimize
the Bag-of-Ngrams (BoN) difference between the model output and the reference
sentence. The BoN training objective is differentiable and can be calculated
efficiently without doing any approximations. Finally, we apply a three-stage
training strategy to combine these two methods to train the NAT model. We
validate our approach on four translation tasks (WMT14 En$\leftrightarrow$De,
WMT16 En$\leftrightarrow$Ro), which shows that our approach largely outperforms
NAT baselines and achieves remarkable performance on all translation tasks. The

This paper is a completely independent investigation into this issue focussing
on the spatial dependence of the correction based on quasars and the magnitude
dependence based on wide binaries. The spatial and magnitude corrections are
connected to each other in the overlap region between $17 < G < 19$. The
spatial correction is presented at several spatial resolutions based on the
HEALPix formalism. The colour dependence of the parallax offset is unclear and
in any case secondary to the spatial and magnitude dependence. The spatial and
magnitude corrections are applied to two samples of brighter sources, namely a
sample of $\sim$100 stars with independent trigonometric parallax measurements
from \it HST \rm data, and a sample of 75 classical cepheids using photometric
parallaxes. The mean offset between the observed GEDR3 parallax and the
independent trigonometric parallax (excluding outliers) is about $-39$~\muas,

classical cepheid sample it is suggested that the photometric parallaxes may be
underestimated by about 5\%.

roughness are investigated and compared to those obtained from full-size DNS
for 12 roughness topographies with systematically varied PDF and PS at four

approach for characterization of rough surfaces providing excellent agreement
in roughness function and zero-plane displacement across various types of

properties, the distribution of time-averaged surface force exerted by the
roughness onto the fluid is examined and compared to the roughness height

distribution has an anisotropic structure with spanwise-elongated coherent

scale, which weakly depends on the considered roughness topography, while the
larger spanwise integral length scale shows a stronger dependence on roughness
characteristics. It is also shown that the sheltering model describes well the

correlations are assessed using the present dataset. It was shown that the most

  Infrastructure Planning and Regulatory Incentives",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many city residents cannot install their private electric vehicle (EV)
chargers due to the lack of dedicated parking spaces or insufficient grid
capacity. This presents a significant barrier towards large-scale EV adoption.
To address this concern, this paper considers a novel business model, on-demand
valet charging, that unlocks the potential of under-utilized public charging
infrastructure to promise higher EV penetration. In the proposed model, a
platform recruits a fleet of couriers that shuttle between customers and public
charging stations to provide on-demand valet charging services to EV owners at
an affordable price. Couriers are dispatched to pick up low-battery EVs from
customers, deliver the EVs to charging stations, plug them in, and then return
the fully-charged EVs to customers. To depict the proposed business model, we
develop a queuing network to represent the stochastic matching dynamics, and
further formulate an economic equilibrium model to capture the incentives of
couriers, customers as well as the platform. These models are used to examine
how charging infrastructure planning and regulatory intervention will affect
the market outcome. First, we find that the optimal charging station densities
for distinct stakeholders are different: couriers prefer a lower density; the
platform prefers a higher density; while the density in-between leads to the
highest EV penetration as it balances the time traveling to and queuing at
charging stations. Second, we evaluate a regulatory policy that imposes a tax
on the platform and invests the tax revenue in public charging infrastructure.
Numerical results suggest that this regulation can suppress the platform's
market power associated with monopoly pricing, increase social welfare, and
facilitate the market expansion.

throughput is related to the number of tile groups and the length of pilot

Moreover, we analyze the relationship between QoE objective and number of

With variable relaxation and recovery, we obtain the optimal average QoE.
Extensive simulation results validate that the proposed algorithm effectively

super-Alfvenic, while the bulk volumes of pa-rental clouds are sub-Alfvenic.
The consequences of these largely ordered cloud B-fields on fragmentation and
star formation are observed. The above paradigm is very different from the
generally accepted theory during the first decade of the century, when cloud
turbulence was assumed to be highly super-Alfvenic. Thus, turbulence anisotropy
and turbulence-induced ambipolar diffusion are also revisited.

essential to reduce short and long-term risks to fetus and mother. Fetal MRI is
increasingly used for fetal brain assessment. Three key biometric linear
measurements important for fetal brain evaluation are Cerebral Biparietal
Diameter (CBD), Bone Biparietal Diameter (BBD), and Trans-Cerebellum Diameter
(TCD), obtained manually by expert radiologists on reference slices, which is
time consuming and prone to human error. The aim of this study was to develop a
fully automatic method computing the CBD, BBD and TCD measurements from fetal
brain MRI. The input is fetal brain MRI volumes which may include the fetal
body and the mother's abdomen. The outputs are the measurement values and
reference slices on which the measurements were computed. The method, which
follows the manual measurements principle, consists of five stages: 1)
computation of a Region Of Interest that includes the fetal brain with an
anisotropic 3D U-Net classifier; 2) reference slice selection with a
Convolutional Neural Network; 3) slice-wise fetal brain structures segmentation
with a multiclass U-Net classifier; 4) computation of the fetal brain
midsagittal line and fetal brain orientation, and; 5) computation of the
measurements. Experimental results on 214 volumes for CBD, BBD and TCD
measurements yielded a mean $L_1$ difference of 1.55mm, 1.45mm and 1.23mm
respectively, and a Bland-Altman 95% confidence interval ($CI_{95}$) of 3.92mm,
3.98mm and 2.25mm respectively. These results are similar to the manual
inter-observer variability. The proposed automatic method for computing
biometric linear measurements of the fetal brain from MR imaging achieves human
level performance. It has the potential of being a useful method for the
assessment of fetal brain biometry in normal and pathological cases, and of
improving routine clinical practice.

all-to-all propagators necessary in this calculation can be obtained with
reasonable precision by a combination of three techniques, the one-end trick,
the sequential propagator, and the covariant approximation averaging (CAA). The
non-local $I=1$ $\pi \pi$ potential is determined at the
next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^2$LO) of the derivative expansion for the
first time, and the resonance parameters of the $\rho$ meson are extracted. The
obtained $\rho$ meson mass is found to be consistent with the value in the
literature, while the value of the coupling $g_{\rho \pi \pi}$ turns out to be
somewhat larger. The latter observation is most likely attributed to the lack
of low-energy information in our lattice setup with the center-of-mass frame.
Such a limitation may appear in other P-wave resonant systems and we discuss
possible improvement in future. With this caution in mind, we positively
conclude that we can reasonably extract the N$^2$LO potential and resonance
parameters even in the system requiring the all-to-all propagators in the HAL
QCD method, which opens up new possibilities for the study of resonances in
lattice QCD.

reporting of these scans. In this work, we present a convolutional neural

$\text{T}_2$-weighted head MRI scans. Using a validated neuroradiology report
classifier, we generated a labelled dataset of 43,754 scans from two large UK
hospitals for model training, and demonstrate accurate classification (area
under the receiver operating curve (AUC) = 0.943) on a test set of 800 scans
labelled by a team of neuroradiologists. Importantly, when trained on scans
from only a single hospital the model generalized to scans from the other
hospital ($\Delta$AUC $\leq$ 0.02). A simulation study demonstrated that our
model would reduce the mean reporting time for abnormal examinations from 28
days to 14 days and from 9 days to 5 days at the two hospitals, demonstrating
feasibility for use in a clinical triage environment.

fiber optics, tightly phase locking several spatial modes and enabling the
coherent transport of a wavepacket through a multimode fiber. A similar problem
is encountered in the temporal compression of multi-mJ pulses to few-cycle
duration in hollow gas-filled fibers. Scaling the fiber length to up to six
meters, hollow fibers have recently reached 1 TW of peak power. Despite the
remarkable utility of the hollow fiber compressor and its widespread
application, however, no analytical model exists to enable insight into the
scaling behavior of maximum compressibility and peak power. Here we extend a
recently introduced formalism for describing mode-locking to the spatially
analogue scenario of locking spatial fiber modes together. Our formalism
unveils the coexistence of two soliton branches for anomalous modal dispersion
and indicates the formation of stable spatio-temporal light bullets that would
be unstable in free space, similar to the temporal cage solitons in
mode-locking theory. Our model enables deeper understanding of the physical
processes behind the formation of such light bullets and predict the existence
of multimode solitons in a much wider range of fiber types than previously
considered possible.

  requirements",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the classic problem of computing the Longest Common Subsequence
(LCS) of two strings of length $n$. While a simple quadratic algorithm has been
known for the problem for more than 40 years, no faster algorithm has been
found despite an extensive effort. The lack of progress on the problem has
recently been explained by Abboud, Backurs, and Vassilevska Williams [FOCS'15]
and Bringmann and K\""unnemann [FOCS'15] who proved that there is no
subquadratic algorithm unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis fails.
This has led the community to look for subquadratic approximation algorithms
for the problem.
  Yet, unlike the edit distance problem for which a constant-factor
approximation in almost-linear time is known, very little progress has been
made on LCS, making it a notoriously difficult problem also in the realm of
approximation. For the general setting, only a naive
$O(n^{\varepsilon/2})$-approximation algorithm with running time
$\tilde{O}(n^{2-\varepsilon})$ has been known, for any constant $0 <
\varepsilon \le 1$. Recently, a breakthrough result by Hajiaghayi, Seddighin,
Seddighin, and Sun [SODA'19] provided a linear-time algorithm that yields a
$O(n^{0.497956})$-approximation in expectation; improving upon the naive
$O(\sqrt{n})$-approximation for the first time.
  In this paper, we provide an algorithm that in time $O(n^{2-\varepsilon})$
computes an $\tilde{O}(n^{2\varepsilon/5})$-approximation with high
probability, for any $0 < \varepsilon \le 1$. Our result (1) gives an
$\tilde{O}(n^{0.4})$-approximation in linear time, improving upon the bound of
Hajiaghayi, Seddighin, Seddighin, and Sun, (2) provides an algorithm whose
approximation scales with any subquadratic running time $O(n^{2-\varepsilon})$,
improving upon the naive bound of $O(n^{\varepsilon/2})$ for any $\varepsilon$,
and (3) instead of only in expectation, succeeds with high probability.

reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can, in one way or another, be
understood as introducing additional objectives, or constraints, in the policy
optimization step. This includes ideas as far ranging as exploration bonuses,
entropy regularization, and regularization toward teachers or data priors when
learning from experts or in offline RL. Often, task reward and auxiliary
objectives are in conflict with each other and it is therefore natural to treat
these examples as instances of multi-objective (MO) optimization problems. We
study the principles underlying MORL and introduce a new algorithm,
Distillation of a Mixture of Experts (DiME), that is intuitive and
scale-invariant under some conditions. We highlight its strengths on standard
MO benchmark problems and consider case studies in which we recast offline RL
and learning from experts as MO problems. This leads to a natural algorithmic
formulation that sheds light on the connection between existing approaches. For
offline RL, we use the MO perspective to derive a simple algorithm, that
optimizes for the standard RL objective plus a behavioral cloning term. This
outperforms state-of-the-art on two established offline RL benchmarks.

(defined as) the eigenvectors corresponding to all small eigenvalues of the

corresponding to a part of the small eigenvalues is more representative of the

the door to cybersecurity concerns affecting Internet of Things (IoT)

leakages, data poisoning, or privilege escalation in IoT scenarios. Combining
behavioral fingerprinting and Machine/Deep Learning (ML/DL) techniques is a
promising approach to identify these malicious spoofing devices by detecting
minor performance differences generated by imperfections in manufacturing.
However, existing solutions are not suitable for single-board devices since
they do not consider their hardware and software limitations, underestimate

measurements, but its precision is currently limited by a strong anisotropy.
Taking advantage of polarization imaging, this work proposes a new approach for
high accuracy Cherenkov dose measurements. Methods: Cherenkov produced in a
15x15x20 cm^3 water tank is imaged with a cooled CCD camera from four polarizer
transmission axes [0{\deg}, 45{\deg}, 90{\deg}, 135{\deg}]. The water tank is
positioned at the isocenter of a 5x5 cm^2, 6 MV photon beam. Using Malus' law,
the polarized portion of the signal is extracted. Corrections are applied to
the polarized signal following azimuthal and polar Cherenkov angular
distributions extracted from Monte Carlo simulations. Percent depth dose and
beam profiles are measured and compared with the prediction from a treatment
planning system (TPS). Results: Corrected polarized signals on the central axis
reduced deviations at depth from 20% to 0.8\pm1%. For the profile measurement,
differences between the corrected polarized signal and the TPS calculations are
1\pm3% and 8\pm3% on the central axis and penumbra regions respectively.
29\pm1% of the Cherenkov signal was found to be polarized. Conclusions: This
work proposes a novel polarization imaging approach enabling high precision
water-based Cherenkov dose measurements. The method allows correction of the
Cherenkov anisotropy within 3% on the beam central axis and in depth.

Gravity mediated entanglement generation so far appears to be the key

Phys. Rev. X Quantum 2, 030330 (2021)] combining an atom interferometer with a
low-frequency mechanical oscillator, a coherence revival test is proposed for
verifying this entanglement generation. With measurements performed only on the

explore formulations of such a protocol, and specifically find that in the
envisioned regime of operation with high thermal excitation, semi-classical
models, where there is no concept of entanglement, also give the same
experimental signatures. We elucidate in a fully quantum mechanical calculation
that entanglement is not the source of the revivals in the relevant parameter
regime. We argue that, in its current form, the suggested test is only relevant
if the oscillator is nearly in a pure quantum state, and in this regime the
effects are too small to be measurable. We further discuss potential open ends.

how the quantum case differs from the classical expectations when testing for
the quantum mechanical nature of a physical system.

how, for a population of myopic agents with homogeneous preferences, changes in

a symmetric two-strategy game with positive externalities and negative feedback
from aggregate behavior to payoffs, so that at every point in time the
population has an incentive to coordinate, whereas over time the more popular
strategy becomes less appealing. Under the best response dynamics and the logit
dynamics with small noise levels the joint trajectories of preferences and

In each case, we form a star of 2.5 M$_\odot$ which is thought to be a typical
barium star mass. We discuss the extent of dilution of accreted material as the
star evolves, and describe the impact on the surface abundances. For accretion
from a 2.5\ms\ primary, if the secondary's initial mass is 2.45 M$_\odot$ or
more, accretion takes place when the secondary is undergoing core helium
burning. Using data from the sample of De Castro et al., we attempt to fit the
observed properties of 74 barium giants using the models we have computed. We
find that all but six of these objects are best fit using ejecta from 2.5
M$_\odot$ (32 objects) or 3 M$_\odot$ (36 objects) AGB stars. Higher accretion
masses are typically required when accreting from a lower mass companion. We
find accretion masses that are broadly consistent with recent hydrodynamical
simulations of wind mass transfer, though the accretion efficiency is toward
the upper limit found in these simulations. For the 18 stars with reported
orbital periods, we find no strong correlations between period and accretion

embeddings. As a result, PairConnect substitutes self dot product with a simple
embedding lookup. We show mathematically that despite being an MLP, our
compute-efficient PairConnect is strictly more expressive than Transformer. Our
experiment on language modeling tasks suggests that PairConnect could achieve
comparable results with Transformer while reducing the computational cost
associated with inference significantly.

relatively small but significant Argus moving group membership probability of

anomalous diffusion are often disqualified for individual short trajectories,
leading to the launch of the Anomalous Diffusion (AnDi) Challenge. This
challenge aims at objectively assessing and comparing new approaches for single

inference of the anomalous diffusion exponent; the classification of the
diffusion model; and the segmentation of trajectories. In this article, to
address the inference and classification tasks in the challenge, we develop a
WaveNet-based deep neural network (WADNet) by combining a modified WaveNet
encoder with long short-term memory networks, without any prior knowledge of
anomalous diffusion. As the performance of our model has surpassed the current
1st places in the challenge leaderboard on both two tasks for all dimensions (6

  Bandits","25 pages, 8 figures",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of minimizing regret in an $N$ agent heterogeneous
stochastic linear bandits framework, where the agents (users) are similar but
not all identical. We model user heterogeneity using two popularly used ideas
in practice; (i) A clustering framework where users are partitioned into groups
with users in the same group being identical to each other, but different
across groups, and (ii) a personalization framework where no two users are
necessarily identical, but a user's parameters are close to that of the
population average. In the clustered users' setup, we propose a novel
algorithm, based on successive refinement of cluster identities and regret
minimization. We show that, for any agent, the regret scales as
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T/N})$, if the agent is in a `well separated' cluster, or
scales as $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{1}{2} + \varepsilon}/(N)^{\frac{1}{2}
-\varepsilon})$ if its cluster is not well separated, where $\varepsilon$ is
positive and arbitrarily close to $0$. Our algorithm is adaptive to the cluster
separation, and is parameter free -- it does not need to know the number of
clusters, separation and cluster size, yet the regret guarantee adapts to the
inherent complexity. In the personalization framework, we introduce a natural
algorithm where, the personal bandit instances are initialized with the
estimates of the global average model. We show that, an agent $i$ whose
parameter deviates from the population average by $\epsilon_i$, attains a
regret scaling of $\widetilde{O}(\epsilon_i\sqrt{T})$. This demonstrates that
if the user representations are close (small $\epsilon_i)$, the resulting
regret is low, and vice-versa. The results are empirically validated and we
observe superior performance of our adaptive algorithms over non-adaptive
baselines.

heavily rely on large general-purpose third-party JavaScript libraries. This
practice increases the size and the processing complexity of a web page by
bringing additional functions that are not used by the page but unnecessarily
downloaded and processed by the browser. In this paper, an analysis of around
40,000 web pages shows that 70% of JavaScript functions on the median page are
unused, and the elimination of these functions would contribute to the
reduction of the page size by 60%. Motivated by these findings, we propose
Muzeel (which means eliminator in Arabic); a solution for eliminating
JavaScript functions that are not used in a given web page (commonly referred
to as dead code). Muzeel extracts all of the page event listeners upon page
load, and emulates user interactions using a bot that triggers each of these
events, in order to eliminate the dead code of functions that are not called by
any of these events. Our evaluation results spanning several Android mobile
phones and browsers show that Muzeel speeds up the page load by around 30% on
low-end phones, and by 25% on high-end phones under 3G network. It also reduces
the speed index (which is an important user experience metric) by 23% and 21%
under the same network on low-end, and high-end phones, respectively.
Additionally, Muzeel reduces the overall download size while maintaining the
visual content and interactive functionality of the pages.

the relaxation inside the horizon. This leads to the Hawking radiation and to
the reconstruction of the interior vacuum state. After the Fermi surface is
fully occupied, the interior region reaches the equilibrium state, for which
the Hawking radiation is absent. If this scenario is applicable to the real

with the event horizon. Inside the event horizon one would have de Sitter space
time, which is separated from the event horizon by the shell of the Planck

  towards ghost imaging with inelastically scattered electrons",,,,,"quant-ph physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In quantum mechanics, entanglement and correlations are not just a mere
sporadic curiosity, but rather common phenomena at the basis of an interacting
quantum system. In electron microscopy, such concepts have not been extensively
explored yet in all their implications; in particular, inelastic scattering can
be reanalyzed in terms of correlation between the electron beam and the sample.
While classical inelastic scattering simply implies loss of coherence in the
electron beam, performing a joint measurement on the electron beam and the
sample excitation could restore the coherence and the lost information. Here,
we propose to exploit joint measurement in electron microscopy for a surprising
and counter-intuitive application of the concept of ghost imaging. Ghost
imaging, first proposed in quantum photonics, can be applied partially in
electron microscopy by performing joint measurement between the portion of the
transmitted electron beam and a photon emitted from the sample reaching a
bucket detector. This would permit us to form a one-dimensional virtual image
of an object that even has not interacted with the electron beam directly. This
technique is extremely promising for low-dose imaging that requires the
minimization of radiation exposure for electron-sensitive materials, because
the object interacts with other form of waves, e.g., photons/surface plasmon
polaritons, and not the electron beam. We demonstrate this concept
theoretically for any inelastic electron-sample interaction in which the
electron excites a single quantum of a collective mode, such as a photon,
plasmon, phonon, magnon, or any optical polariton.

higher isolation ratio in the optimal detuning regime. Such a series of

method. However, data may be nonlinearly related to the quantity of interest,
rendering the proper conditioning of random variables difficult and limiting
the range of numerical tasks that can be addressed. Instead, this paper
proposes to construct probabilistic numerical methods based only on the final
output from a traditional method. A convergent sequence of approximations to
the quantity of interest constitute a dataset, from which the limiting quantity
of interest can be extrapolated, in a probabilistic analogue of Richardson's
deferred approach to the limit. This black box approach (1) massively expands
the range of tasks to which probabilistic numerics can be applied, (2) inherits
the features and performance of state-of-the-art numerical methods, and (3)
enables provably higher orders of convergence to be achieved. Applications are
presented for nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations, as well as
for eigenvalue problems-a setting for which no probabilistic numerical methods
have yet been developed.

and forecast future behaviour of sovereign bond yield spreads in Italy and
Spain. We use a big, open-source, database known as Global Database of Events,
Language and Tone to construct emotion indicators of bond market affective
states. We find that negative emotions extracted from news improve the
forecasting power of government yield spread models during distressed periods
even after controlling for the number of negative words present in the text. In
addition, stronger negative emotions, such as panic, reveal useful information
for predicting changes in spread at the short-term horizon, while milder
emotions, such as distress, are useful at longer time horizons. Emotions
generated by the Italian political turmoil propagate to the Spanish news
affecting this neighbourhood market.

the dependency structure of the 465 theorems in Euclid's Elements, finding
empirical signatures of concepts such as the power of a theorem. We apply
similar methods to a more exhaustive study of possible theorems in logic, as
well as to the analysis of dependency structures in projects to formalize
modern pure mathematics. We discuss the process of identifying both intrinsic
features of metamathematical space, and features of its exploration through the
historical progress of mathematics.

broadened the spectrum of how one can get in contact with new acquaintances. A
common feature of such apps is a swipe enabling a user to decide whether to
like or dislike another user. As is the case in real life, a user may be more
or less popular, which implies the distribution of likes among different users
is not trivial. In this paper we show how likes are distributed across users,
based on different decision-making strategies and on different app settings. We
apply theoretical methods originally developed in stochastic and coagulation
processes to the investigation into the dynamics of dating app networks. More
specifically, we show that whenever a dating app differentially displays
different users with respect to their popularity in different models, users are
split into two categories: a first category including users who have received
most likes and a second category, referred to as a condensate, which in the
long-term will be reduced to a small fraction of likes or to no likes at all.
Finally, we explore different models based on a rating system of the users,
known as Elo. These models will turn out to exhibit behaviour typical of
gelating systems and non-trivial distribution of Elo rating.

which has served quite well, but also has led to several issues. The free field
describing a free particle (with no interaction term) can suddenly become
nonrenormalizable the instant a suitable interaction term appears. For example,
using canonical quantization, $\varphi^4_4$, has been deemed a ``free"" theory
with no difference from a truly free field [1], [2], [3]. Using the same model,
affine quantization has led to a truly interacting theory [4]. This fact alone
asserts that canonical and affine tools of quantization deserve to be open to
their procedures together as a significant enlargement of QFT.
