collisions, along with the production of hadrons. Radiation from the very first
instants to the final moments of the evolution is included. The hybrid model
used here describes all stages of relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
Chronologically, those are an initial state reflecting the collision of nuclei
described within the Color Glass Condensate effective theory; a pre-equilibrium
phase based on non-equilibrium linear response; relativistic viscous
hydrodynamics, and a hadronic afterburner. The effect of the pre-equilibrium
phase on both photonic and hadronic observables is highlighted for the first
time. The potential of photon observables -- spectrum, differential elliptic
and triangular flow -- to reveal the chemical equilibration time is studied.
Finally, we consider ""small collision systems"", including proton+nucleus
collisions and collisions of light nuclei, as probed by hadronic and
electromagnetic observables. We demonstrate how photon production can signal
the formation of quark-gluon plasma in such small systems.

a new approach to fully characterize the dual-primal solutions in such

approach allows to prove convergence and robustness of this algorithm, which,
to our best knowledge, were unknown even in the two marginal case. Our methods
are based on careful a priori estimates in the dual problem, which we believe

produces momentum exchange up to first order in cosmological perturbations. The
first one corresponds to a perfect-fluid model of the dark components with an
explicit interacting Lagrangian, where dark energy acts as a dark radiation at
early times and behaves as a cosmological constant at late times. The second
one is a dynamical dark energy model with a dark radiation component, where the
momentum exchange covariantly modifies the conservation equations in the dark
sector. Using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations

be alleviated due to the additional radiation, while the $\sigma_8$ tension
present in the $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model can be eased by the weaker
galaxy clustering that occurs in these interacting models. Furthermore, we show
that, while CMB+BAO+SnIa data put only upper bounds on the coupling strength,
adding low-redshift data in the form of a constraint on the parameter $S_8$
strongly favours nonvanishing values of the interaction parameters. Our
findings are in line with other results in the literature that could signal a

of modes is important if, for example, one is interested in problems of sound
emission or flow-acoustic interactions. In this work we show how a
distantly-confined jet may be used as a surrogate problem for the free jet, in
which free-stream acoustic waves appear as a set of discrete modes. Comparing
the modes observed in the free jet with those of the distantly-confined jet, we
show that, other than the free-stream acoustic modes, the eigenvectors and
eigenvalues converge with wall distance. The proposed surrogate problem thus
efficiently reproduces the dynamics of the original problem, while allowing to

harder pairs improve the representation of some features, the improvement comes
at the cost of suppressing previously well represented features. In response,
we propose implicit feature modification (IFM), a method for altering positive

the prior of view-peculiar variable follows continuous Gaussian distribution,

numerical optimization with search over circuit structures face scalability
challenges due to a large number of parameters, exponential search spaces, and
complex objective functions. The LEAP algorithm improves scaling across these
dimensions using iterative circuit synthesis, incremental re-optimization,
dimensionality reduction, and improved numerical optimization. LEAP draws on
the design of the optimal synthesis algorithm QSearch by extending it with an
incremental approach to determine constant prefix solutions for a circuit. By
narrowing the search space, LEAP improves scalability from four to six qubit
circuits. LEAP was evaluated with known quantum circuits such as QFT and
physical simulation circuits like the VQE, TFIM, and QITE. LEAP can compile
four qubit unitaries up to $59\times$ faster than QSearch and five and six
qubit unitaries with up to $1.2\times$ fewer CNOTs compared to the QFAST
package. LEAP can reduce the CNOT count by up to $36\times$, or $7\times$ on
average, compared to the CQC Tket compiler. Despite its heuristics, LEAP has
generated optimal circuits for many test cases with a priori known solutions.
The techniques introduced by LEAP are applicable to other

of neural contextual language models such as BERT for analysing the documents'
and queries' contents and computing their relevance scores -- has shown a
promising performance on several information retrieval tasks still relying on
the traditional inverted index for identifying documents relevant to a query.
Two different dense retrieval families have emerged: the use of single embedded
representations for each passage and query (e.g. using BERT's [CLS] token), or
via multiple representations (e.g. using an embedding for each token of the
query and document). In this work, we conduct the first study into the
potential for multiple representation dense retrieval to be enhanced using
pseudo-relevance feedback. In particular, based on the pseudo-relevant set of
documents identified using a first-pass dense retrieval, we extract
representative feedback embeddings (using KMeans clustering) -- while ensuring
that these embeddings discriminate among passages (based on IDF) -- which are
then added to the query representation. These additional feedback embeddings
are shown to both enhance the effectiveness of a reranking as well as an
additional dense retrieval operation. Indeed, experiments on the MSMARCO
passage ranking dataset show that MAP can be improved by upto 26% on the TREC

in recent years and is recognized as a promising advanced process control
method for the next generation smart manufacturing. It can lead to improving
economic performance but at the same time increases the computational
complexity significantly. Model approximation has been a standard approach for
reducing computational complexity in process control. In this work, we perform
a study on three types of representative model approximation methods applied to
EMPC, including model reduction based on available first-principle models
(e.g., proper orthogonal decomposition), system identification based on
input-output data (e.g., subspace identification) that results in an explicitly
expressed mathematical model, and neural networks based on input-output data. A
representative algorithm from each model approximation method is considered.
Two processes that are very different in dynamic nature and complexity were
selected as benchmark processes for computational complexity and economic
performance comparison, namely an alkylation process and a wastewater treatment
plant (WWTP). The strengths and drawbacks of each method are summarized
according to the simulation results, with future research direction regarding

Jupiter KELT-9b in the main line formation region is a few thousand degrees
higher than predicted by self-consistent models. We test whether non-local
thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects are responsible for the presumably
higher temperature. We employ the Cloudy NLTE radiative transfer code to
self-consistently compute the upper atmospheric temperature-pressure (TP)
profile of KELT-9b, assuming solar metallicity. The Cloudy NLTE TP profile is
$\approx$2000 K hotter than that obtained with previous models assuming local
thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). In particular, in the 1-10$^{-7}$ bar range
the temperature increases from $\approx$4000 K to $\approx$8500 K, remaining
roughly constant at lower pressures. We find that the high temperature in the
upper atmosphere of KELT-9b is driven principally by NLTE effects modifying the
Fe and Mg level populations, which strongly influence the atmospheric thermal
balance. We employ Cloudy to compute LTE and NLTE synthetic transmission
spectra on the basis of the TP profiles computed in LTE and NLTE, respectively,
finding that the NLTE model generally produces stronger absorption lines than
the LTE model (up to 30%), which is largest in the ultraviolet. We compare the
NLTE synthetic transmission spectrum with the observed H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$
line profiles obtaining an excellent match, thus supporting our results. The
NLTE synthetic transmission spectrum can be used to guide future observations
aiming at detecting features in the planet's transmission spectrum. Metals,
such as Mg and Fe, and NLTE effects shape the upper atmospheric temperature

However, this is very challenging and error-prone, evidenced by the large

Since any state variable can be associated with some frame, reference frames
can be naturally modeled as variable types. We hence develop a novel type
system that can automatically infer variables' frame types and in turn detect
any type inconsistencies and violations of frame conventions. The evaluation on

by adjusting the relative decay strengths of the qubits and cavity field, we
kill many unwanted excitation pathways. This leads to dipole blockade. In

corresponding stochastic processes should, in most cases, be considered in
bounded domains, possibly with obstacles. This has been known for a long time
and yet, very little has been done for the quantification of uncertainties in
modelling complex behavioral systems described by such stochastic processes. In
this paper, we address this challenge by considering a coupled system of
Skorokhod-type stochastic differential equations (SDEs) describing interactions
between active and passive participants of a mixed-population group. In
developing a multi-fidelity modelling methodology for such behavioral systems,
we combine low- and high-fidelity results obtained from (a) the solution of the
underlying coupled system of SDEs and (b) simulations with a
statistical-mechanics-based lattice gas model, where we employ a kinetic Monte

extracting a triangle mesh from a discretized implicit field. Classical MC is
defined by coarse tessellation templates isolated to individual cubes. While
more refined tessellations have been proposed, they all make heuristic
assumptions, such as trilinearity, when determining the vertex positions and
local mesh topologies in each cube. In principle, none of these approaches can
reconstruct geometric features that reveal coherence or dependencies between
nearby cubes (e.g., a sharp edge), as such information is unaccounted for,
resulting in poor estimates of the true underlying implicit field. To tackle
these challenges, we re-cast MC from a deep learning perspective, by designing
tessellation templates more apt at preserving geometric features, and learning
the vertex positions and mesh topologies from training meshes, to account for
contextual information from nearby cubes. We develop a compact per-cube
parameterization to represent the output triangle mesh, while being compatible
with neural processing, so that a simple 3D convolutional network can be
employed for the training. We show that all topological cases in each cube that
are applicable to our design can be easily derived using our representation,
and the resulting tessellations can also be obtained naturally and efficiently
by following a few design guidelines. In addition, our network learns local
features with limited receptive fields, hence it generalizes well to new shapes
and new datasets. We evaluate our neural MC approach by quantitative and
qualitative comparisons to all well-known MC variants. In particular, we
demonstrate the ability of our network to recover sharp features such as edges

  water equations by convex combination","16 page main text, 11 page supplemental information",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Finite volume schemes for hyperbolic balance laws require a piecewise
polynomial reconstruction of the cell averaged values, and a reconstruction is
termed `well-balanced' if it is able to simulate steady states at higher order
than time evolving states. For the shallow water system this involves
reconstructing in surface elevation, to which modifications must be made as the
fluid depth becomes small to ensure positivity, and for many reconstruction
schemes a modification of the inertial field is also required to ensure the
velocities are bounded.
  We propose here a reconstruction based on a convex combination of surface and
depth reconstructions which ensures that the depth increases with the cell
average depth. We also discuss how, for cells that are much shallower than
their neighbours, reducing the variation in the reconstructed flux yields
bounds on the velocities. This approach is generalisable to high order schemes,
problems in multiple spacial dimensions, and to more complicated systems of
equations. We present reconstructions and associated technical results for
three systems, the standard shallow water equations, shallow water in a channel
of varying width, and a shallow water model of a particle driven current.
Positivity preserving time stepping is also discussed.

statistics of riverine flows. In this study, we developed encoder-decoder

trained the CNNs using a dataset obtained from the LES of the flood flow in a

Subsequently, we employed the trained CNNs to predict the turbulent statistics
of the flood flow in a river with different bridge pier arrangements, which

prostate. Overall, 40 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or
prostate cancer (PCa) were examined with three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
sequences: T2-weighted MRI (T2w), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and
MRE-based tomoelastography yielding six independent sets of imaging data per
patient (T2w, DWI, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), MRE magnitude, shear
wave speed, and loss angle maps). Combinations of these data were used to train
Dense U-nets with manually segmented masks of the entire prostate gland (PG),
central zone (CZ), and peripheral zone (PZ) in 30 patients and to validate them
in 10 patients. Dice score (DS), sensitivity, specificity, and Hausdorff
distance were determined. We found that segmentation based on MRE magnitude
maps alone (DS, PG: 0.93$\pm$0.04, CZ: 0.95$\pm$0.03, PZ: 0.77$\pm$0.05) was
more accurate than magnitude maps combined with T2w and DWI_b (DS, PG:
0.91$\pm$0.04, CZ: 0.91$\pm$0.06, PZ: 0.63$\pm$0.16) or T2w alone (DS, PG:
0.92$\pm$0.03, CZ: 0.91$\pm$0.04, PZ: 0.65$\pm$0.08). Automatically tabulated
MRE values were not different from ground-truth values (P>0.05). In conclusion:
MRE combined with Dense U-net segmentation allows tabulation of quantitative
imaging markers without manual analysis and independent of other MRI sequences
and can thus contribute to PCa detection and classification.

different from previous works, the analytical formulae of relevant loop
functions after integration are now derived and put into compact forms with the
help of the Passarino-Veltman functions. Second, given the interactions of muon
with new particles running in the loop, we clarify when the one-loop

and the absence of any divergences in the calculations leads to some
consistency conditions for the construction of ultraviolet complete models.

non-stationary rewards. Using numerical simulations, we show that this
adaptation retains the benefits of shrinkage, and improves the stability of
reward estimation by more than 50%. Our proposal reduces variability in
treatment allocations to the best arm by up to 3.8x, and improves statistical

exponential slowdowns at low temperatures. This is due to the emergence of
multiple metastable phases in the state space, separated by narrow bottlenecks
that are hard for the dynamics to cross. It is a folklore belief that if the
dynamics is initialized from an appropriate random mixture of ground states,
one for each phase, then convergence to the Gibbs distribution should be much
faster. However, such phenomena have largely evaded rigorous analysis, as most
tools in the study of Markov chain mixing times are tailored to worst-case
initializations.
  In this paper we develop a general framework towards establishing this
conjectured behavior for the Ising model. In the classical setting of the Ising
model on an $N$-vertex torus in $\mathbb Z^d$, our framework implies that the
mixing time for the Glauber dynamics, initialized from a $\frac 12$-$\frac 12$
mixture of the all-plus and all-minus configurations, is $N^{1+o(1)}$ in
dimension $d=2$, and at most quasi-polynomial in all dimensions $d\ge 3$, at
all temperatures below the critical one. The key innovation in our analysis is
the introduction of the notion of ""weak spatial mixing within a phase"", a
low-temperature adaptation of the classical concept of weak spatial mixing. We
show both that this new notion is strong enough to control the mixing time from
the above random initialization (by relating it to the mixing time with plus
boundary condition at $O(\log N)$ scales), and that it holds at all low
temperatures in all dimensions.
  This framework naturally extends to much more general families of graphs. To
illustrate this, we also use the same approach to establish optimal $O(N\log
N)$ mixing for the Ising Glauber dynamics on random regular graphs at
sufficiently low temperatures, when initialized from the same random mixture.

strongly correlated quantum matter, from fractional quantum Hall liquids, to
atoms in optical lattices and twisted bilayer graphene. Crystalline phases
often compete with correlated quantum liquids, and transitions between them
occur when the energy cost of forming a density wave approaches zero. A prime
example occurs for electrons in high magnetic fields, where the instability of
quantum Hall liquids towards a Wigner crystal is heralded by a roton-like
softening of density modulations at the magnetic length. Remarkably,
interacting bosons in a gauge field are also expected to form analogous liquid
and crystalline states. However, combining interactions with strong synthetic
magnetic fields has been a challenge for experiments on bosonic quantum gases.
Here, we study the purely interaction-driven dynamics of a Landau gauge
Bose-Einstein condensate in and near the lowest Landau level (LLL). We observe
a spontaneous crystallization driven by condensation of magneto-rotons,
excitations visible as density modulations at the magnetic length. Increasing
the cloud density smoothly connects this behaviour to a quantum version of the
Kelvin-Helmholtz hydrodynamic instability, driven by the sheared internal flow
profile of the rapidly rotating condensate. At long times the condensate
self-organizes into a persistent array of droplets, separated by vortex
streets, which are stabilized by a balance of interactions and effective

space of probability distributions with a well-defined operational
interpretation: two distributions are far apart if they are readily
distinguishable from one another. The quantum information metric generalizes
this to the space of quantum states, and thus defines a notion of distance on
an arbitrary continuous family of quantum field theories via their vacua that
is proportional to the metric on moduli space when restricted appropriately. In
this paper, we study this metric and its operational interpretation in a
variety of examples. We specifically focus on why and how infinite distance
singularities appear. We argue that two theories are infinitely far apart if
they are hyper-distinguishable: that is, if they can be distinguished from one
another, with certainty, using only a few measurements. We explain why such
singularities appear for the simple harmonic oscillator yet are absent for
quantum field theories near a typical quantum critical point, and show how an
infinite distance point can emerge when a tower of fields degenerates in mass.
Finally, we use this perspective to provide a potential bottom-up motivation
for the Swampland Distance Conjecture and indicate how we might extend it
beyond current lampposts.

For the Milky Way bulge, there are currently essentially
no measurements of carbon in un-evolved stars, hampering our abilities to
properly compare Galactic chemical evolution models to observational data for
this still enigmatic stellar population. AIMS: We aim to determine carbon
abundances for our sample of 91 microlensed bulge dwarf and subgiant stars.
Together with new determinations for oxygen this forms the first statistically
significant sample of bulge stars that have C and O abundances measured, and
for which the C abundances have not been altered by the nuclear burning
processes internal to the stars. METHODS: The analysis is based on
high-resolution spectra for a sample of 91 dwarf and subgiant stars that were
obtained during microlensing events when the brightnesses of the stars were
highly magnified. Carbon abundances were determined through spectral line
synthesis of five CI lines around 9100 A, and oxygen abundances using the three
OI lines at about 7770 A. [ABRIDGED] RESULTS: Carbon abundances was possible to
determine for 70 of the 91 stars in the sample and oxygen abundances for 88 of
the 91 stars in the sample. The [C/Fe] ratio evolves essentially in lockstep
with [Fe/H], centred around solar values at all [Fe/H]. The [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] trend
has an appearance very similar to that observed for other alpha-elements in the
bulge, [ABRIDGED]. When dividing the bulge sample into two sub-groups, one
younger than 8 Gyr and one older than 8 Gyr, the stars in the two groups follow
exactly the elemental abundance trends defined by the solar neighbourhood thin
and thick disks, respectively. Comparisons with recent models of Galactic
chemical evolution in the [C/O]-[O/H] plane shows that the models that best
match the data are the ones that have been calculated with the Galactic thin
and thick disks in mind. [ABRIDGED] ....

difference imaging to detect new transient sources. However, even with existing

subtractions, false detections from low signal-to-noise images, and detections
of pre-existing variable sources. Currently, human visual inspection to remove
the false positives is a central part of multimessenger follow-up observations,
but when next generation gravitational wave and neutrino detectors come online

will be prohibitively expensive. We approach this problem with two
convolutional neural networks operating on the difference imaging outputs. The
first network focuses on removing false detections and demonstrates an accuracy
of 92 percent on our dataset. The second network focuses on sorting all real
detections by the probability of being a transient source within a host galaxy
and distinguishes between various classes of images that previously required
additional human inspection. We find the number of images requiring human

factor of 3.6 using our approach in combination with existing algorithms,
facilitating rapid multimessenger counterpart identification by the

arXiv:2011.13981, we study the patterns of phase transitions in these systems
that lead to a symmetry-broken phase in the high temperature limit. These
deformations involve only the scalar fields in the models. The marginally
relevant deformations are obtained by varying certain double trace quartic
couplings between the scalar fields. The relevant deformations, on the other
hand, are obtained by adding masses to the scalar fields while keeping all the
couplings frozen at their fixed point values. At the $N\rightarrow\infty$
limit, the RG flows triggered by these deformations approach the aforementioned
weakly coupled CFTs in the UV regime. These UV fixed points lie on a conformal
manifold with the shape of a circle in the space of couplings. In certain
parameter regimes a subset of points on this manifold exhibits thermal order
characterized by the spontaneous breaking of a global $\mathbb Z_2$ or $U(1)$
symmetry and Higgsing of a subset of gauge bosons at all nonzero temperatures.
We show that the RG flows triggered by the marginally relevant deformations
lead to a weakly coupled IR fixed point which lacks the thermal order. Thus,
the systems defined by these RG flows undergo a transition from a disordered
phase at low temperatures to an ordered phase at high temperatures. This
provides examples of both inverse symmetry breaking and symmetry
nonrestoration. For the relevant deformations, we demonstrate that a variety of
phase transitions are possible depending on the signs and magnitudes of the
masses (squared) added to the scalar fields. Using thermal perturbation theory,
we derive the approximate values of the critical temperatures for all these
phase transitions. All the results are obtained at the $N\rightarrow\infty$
limit.

observed trends beyond the [$\alpha$/Fe] knee of the Gaia Sausage

yield calculations indicate a significant contribution from sub-Chandrasekhar
mass Type Ia supernovae in this system (from $\sim60$% to $100$% depending on
the theoretical model with an additional $\pm10$% systematic from NLTE

results suggest that sub-Chandrasekhar mass channels are a significant, perhaps
even dominant, contribution to Type Ia supernovae in metal-poor systems, whilst
more metal-rich systems could be explained by metallicity-dependent
sub-Chandrasekhar mass yields, possibly with additional progenitor mass
variation related to star formation history, or an increased contribution from
Chandrasekhar mass channels at higher metallicity.

must be deposited with little net gas transfer, while at 500 kpc the gas need
to be replaced by a large amount of cold, lower entropy gas, consistent with
theoretical expectation of a filamentary gas stream, which brings low entropy
gas to 500 kpc and energy at even smaller radii. At $r \gtrsim 400$ kpc the
polytropic index takes a low value, which indicates the presence of a large
amount of non-thermal pressure. Our work also introduces a new definition of

dependence on mass, pseudo-evolution and returns a number with unique

temperature. For classic insulators, the Hall conductivity becomes zero at the

Hall isolators, in which a more complex scenario is observed at high magnetic
fields. Here, we report experimental evidence for a quasi-quantized Hall
insulator in the quantum limit of the three-dimensional semimetal SrSi2. Our
measurements reveal a magnetic field-range, in which the longitudinal
resistivity diverges with decreasing temperature, while the Hall conductivity
approaches a quasi-quantized value that is given only by the conductance
quantum and the Fermi wave vector in the field-direction. The quasi-quantized
Hall insulator appears in a magnetic-field induced insulating ground state of
three-dimensional materials and is deeply rooted in quantum Hall physics.

are highly demanded in clinical practice for assisting the diagnosis and
assessment of hepatic tumor disease. However, automatic liver and lesion
segmentation from contrast-enhanced CT volumes is extremely challenging due to
the diversity in contrast, resolution, and quality of images. Previous methods
based on UNet for 2D slice-by-slice or 3D volume-by-volume segmentation either
lack sufficient spatial contexts or suffer from high GPU computational cost,
which limits the performance. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel
context-aware PolyUNet for accurate liver and lesion segmentation. It jointly
explores structural diversity and consecutive t-adjacent slices to enrich
feature expressive power and spatial contextual information while avoiding the
overload of GPU memory consumption. In addition, we utilize zoom out/in and
two-stage refinement strategy to exclude the irrelevant contexts and focus on
the specific region for the fine-grained segmentation. Our method achieved very
competitive performance at the MICCAI 2017 Liver Tumor Segmentation (LiTS)
Challenge among all tasks with a single model and ranked the $3^{rd}$,
$12^{th}$, $2^{nd}$, and $5^{th}$ places in the liver segmentation, lesion

attracted massive attention in recent years. So far, a wide range of solids

for a compound to display Weyl points it must exhibit either inversion symmetry
breaking or time reversal symmetry breaking. Hence, the Weyl fermions are
vulnerable to annihilation from structural distortions or lattice
imperfections. In the absence of both mirror and inversion symmetry, SrSi2 has
been predicted as a robust WSM by recent theoretical works. Here, supported by
first-principles calculations, we present systematical angle-resolved
photoemission studies of undoped SrSi2 and Ca-doped SrSi2 single crystals.
However, our result shows no evidence of the predicted Weyl fermions at the kz

studying strongly correlated electron physics, owing to its almost
dispersionless low-energy bands and the ability to tune the band filling by
electrostatic gating. Techniques to control the twist angle between graphene
layers have led to rapid experimental progress but improving sample quality is
essential for separating the delicate correlated-electron physics from disorder
effects. Owing to the 2D nature of the system and the relatively low carrier
density, the samples are highly susceptible to small doping inhomogeneity which
can drastically modify the local potential landscape. This potential disorder
is distinct from the twist-angle variation which has been studied elsewhere.
Here, by using low temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy and planar
tunneling junction measurements, we demonstrate that flat bands in twisted
bilayer graphene can amplify small doping inhomogeneity that surprisingly leads
to carrier confinement, which in graphene could previously only be realized in
the presence of a strong magnetic field.

us assume a storage system encodes $k\ell$ information symbols over a finite

parameterized by a set of tuples $\{(R_j,k_j,\ell_j): 1 \le j \le a\}$,

added to generate ridge maps to ensure that fingerprint information and

generating erroneous minutiae. The second sub-network is a verifier that helps
the generator to preserve the ID information during the generation process.
Using a database of blurred fingerprints and corresponding ridge maps, the deep
network learns to deblur from the input blurry samples. We evaluate the
proposed method in combination with two different fingerprint matching
algorithms. We achieved an accuracy of 95.18% on our fingerprint database for

trajectories. Their increasing availability has fueled new hopes to leverage
them and develop accurate risk prediction models for a wide range of diseases.
Given the complex interrelationships of medical records and patient outcomes,
deep learning models have shown clear merits in achieving this goal. However, a
key limitation of these models remains their capacity in processing long
sequences. Capturing the whole history of medical encounters is expected to
lead to more accurate predictions, but the inclusion of records collected for
decades and from multiple resources can inevitably exceed the receptive field
of the existing deep learning architectures. This can result in missing
crucial, long-term dependencies. To address this gap, we present Hi-BEHRT, a
hierarchical Transformer-based model that can significantly expand the
receptive field of Transformers and extract associations from much longer
sequences. Using a multimodal large-scale linked longitudinal electronic health
records, the Hi-BEHRT exceeds the state-of-the-art BEHRT 1% to 5% for area
under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve and 3% to 6% for area
under the precision recall (AUPRC) curve on average, and 3% to 6% (AUROC) and
3% to 11% (AUPRC) for patients with long medical history for 5-year heart
failure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and stroke risk prediction.
Additionally, because pretraining for hierarchical Transformer is not
well-established, we provide an effective end-to-end contrastive pre-training
strategy for Hi-BEHRT using EHR, improving its transferability on predicting
clinical events with relatively small training dataset.

various structures in the jets. The aim of the present study is to measure the
proper motions of the previously discovered kinematically separated structures
in the working surface of the HH 83 collimated outflow. We used observations
from two epochs separated by 15 years, which were performed on the 6m telescope
with Fabry-Perot scanning interferometer. We obtained images corresponding to
different radial velocities for the two separate epochs, and used them to
measure proper motions. In the course of our data analysis, we discovered a
counter bow-shock of HH 83 flow with positive radial velocity, which makes this
flow a relatively symmetric bipolar system. The second epoch observations
confirm that the working surface of the flow is split into two structures with
an exceptionally large (250 km\ s$^{-1}$) difference in radial velocity. The
proper motions of these structures are almost equal, which suggests that they
are physically connected. The asymmetry of the bow shock and the turning of
proper motion vectors suggests a collision between the outflow and a dense
cloud. The profile of the H$\alpha$ line for the directly invisible infrared
source HH 83 IRS, obtained by integration of the data within the reflection
nebula, suggests it to be of P Cyg type with a broad absorption component
characteristic of the FU Ori like objects. If this object underwent an FU Ori
type outburst, which created the HH 83 working surfaces, its eruption took
place about 1500 years ago according to the kinematical age of the outflow.

measurement is less than 0.5\% in the region with intensity above 5,500 MJy

1.6\% in the region above this intensity, similar to values in other high--mass

other hand, the magnetic field direction in the loop is not aligned with the
large--scale magnetic fields but has tight alignment with the loop itself.

constrain cosmological parameters through weak lensing. We present 676 new
high-confidence spectroscopic redshifts obtained by the C3R2 survey in the
2017B-2019B semesters using the DEIMOS, LRIS, and MOSFIRE multi-object
spectrographs on the Keck telescopes. Combined with the 4454 redshifts
previously published by this project, the C3R2 survey has now obtained and
published 5130 high-quality galaxy spectra and redshifts. If we restrict
consideration to only the 0.2 < z(phot) < 2.6 range of interest for the Euclid
cosmological goals, then with the current data release C3R2 has increased the
spectroscopic redshift coverage of the Euclid color space from 51% (as reported
by Masters et al. 2015) to the current 91%. Once completed and combined with
extensive data collected by other spectroscopic surveys, C3R2 should provide
the spectroscopic calibration set needed to enable photometric redshifts to
meet the cosmology requirements for Euclid, and make significant headway toward
solving the problem for Roman.

  Optical Wireless Systems",,,,,"eess.SP cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) have demonstrated
suitability for data transmission in indoor optical wireless communication
(OWC) systems due to the high modulation bandwidth and low manufacturing cost
of these sources. Specifically, resource allocation is one of the major
challenges that can affect the performance of multi-user optical wireless
systems. In this paper, an optimisation problem is formulated to optimally
assign each user to an optical access point (AP) composed of multiple VCSELs
within a VCSEL array at a certain time to maximise the signal to interference
plus noise ratio (SINR). In this context, a mixed-integer linear programming
(MILP) model is introduced to solve this optimisation problem. Despite the
optimality of the MILP model, it is considered impractical due to its high
complexity, high memory and full system information requirements. Therefore,
reinforcement Learning (RL) is considered, which recently has been widely
investigated as a practical solution for various optimization problems in
cellular networks due to its ability to interact with environments with no
previous experience. In particular, a Q-learning (QL) algorithm is investigated
to perform resource management in a steerable VCSEL-based OWC systems. The
results demonstrate the ability of the QL algorithm to achieve optimal
solutions close to the MILP model. Moreover, the adoption of beam steering,
using holograms implemented by exploiting liquid crystal devices, results in
further enhancement in the performance of the network considered.

long-distance properties of the theory in the presence of the topological

the long-distance modes in the functional integral measure and tracing it over
successive length scales. The key point is that the vacuum splits into
disconnected topological sectors with markedly different physical

models, we utilize a model-free data-driven approach with foundations in
machine learning to generate codebooks that adapt to the surrounding
propagation conditions. We use a tensor representation of the FD-MIMO channel
and exploit its properties to design quantized version of the channel
precoders. We find the best representation of the optimal precoder as a
function of Kronecker Product (KP) of two low-dimensional precoders,
respectively corresponding to the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the
UPA, obtained from the tensor decomposition of the channel. We then quantize
this precoder to design product codebooks such that an average loss in mutual
information due to quantization of channel state information (CSI) is
minimized. The key technical contribution lies in exploiting the constraints on
the precoders to reduce the product codebook design problem to an unsupervised
clustering problem on a Cartesian Product Grassmann manifold (CPM), where the
cluster centroids form a finite-sized precoder codebook. This codebook can be
found efficiently by running a $K$-means clustering on the CPM. With a suitable
induced distance metric on the CPM, we show that the construction of product
codebooks is equivalent to finding the optimal set of centroids on the factor
manifolds corresponding to the horizontal and vertical dimensions. Simulation
results are presented to demonstrate the capability of the proposed design
criterion in learning the codebooks and the attractive performance of the

we address this problem in an active learning setting where we can spend a
given budget on translating in-domain data, and gradually fine-tune a
pre-trained out-of-domain NMT model on the newly translated data. Existing
active learning methods for NMT usually select sentences based on uncertainty
scores, but these methods require costly translation of full sentences even
when only one or two key phrases within the sentence are informative. To
address this limitation, we re-examine previous work from the phrase-based
machine translation (PBMT) era that selected not full sentences, but rather
individual phrases. However, while incorporating these phrases into PBMT
systems was relatively simple, it is less trivial for NMT systems, which need
to be trained on full sequences to capture larger structural properties of
sentences unique to the new domain. To overcome these hurdles, we propose to
select both full sentences and individual phrases from unlabelled data in the
new domain for routing to human translators. In a German-English translation
task, our active learning approach achieves consistent improvements over
uncertainty-based sentence selection methods, improving up to 1.2 BLEU score
over strong active learning baselines.

problem: On a directed graph (of transplant compatibilities among patient-donor
pairs), the mechanism must select a simple path (a chain of transplantations)
starting at a distinguished vertex (an altruistic donor) such that the total
length of this path is as large as possible (a maximum number of patients
receive a kidney). However, the mechanism does not have direct access to the
graph. Instead, the vertices are partitioned over multiple players (hospitals),
and each player reports a subset of her vertices to the mechanism. In
particular, a player may strategically omit vertices to increase how many of
her vertices lie on the path returned by the mechanism.
  Our objective is to find mechanisms that limit incentives for such
manipulation while producing long paths. Unfortunately, in worst-case
instances, competing with the overall longest path is impossible while
incentivizing (approximate) truthfulness, i.e., requiring that hiding nodes
cannot increase a player's utility by more than a factor of $1 + o(1)$. We
therefore adopt a semi-random model where a small ($o(n)$) number of random
edges are added to worst-case instances. While it remains impossible for
truthful mechanisms to compete with the overall longest path, we give a
truthful mechanism that competes with a weaker but non-trivial benchmark: the
length of any path whose subpaths within each player have a minimum average
length. In fact, our mechanism satisfies even a stronger notion of
truthfulness, which we call matching-time incentive compatibility. This notion
of truthfulness requires that each player not only reports her nodes truthfully
but also does not stop the returned path at any of her nodes in order to divert
it to a continuation inside her own subgraph.

a crucial step for data-driven operations, for instance to personalize
treatment or pricing. We investigate how to estimate price sensitivity from
transaction-level data. In causal inference terms, we estimate heterogeneous
treatment effects when (a) the response to treatment (here, whether a customer
buys a product) is binary, and (b) treatment assignments are partially observed
(here, full information is only available for purchased items).
Methodology/Results: We propose a recursive partitioning procedure to estimate
heterogeneous odds ratio, a widely used measure of treatment effect in medicine
and social sciences. We integrate an adversarial imputation step to allow for
robust estimation even in presence of partially observed treatment assignments.
We validate our methodology on synthetic data and apply it to three case
studies from political science, medicine, and revenue management. Managerial
Implications: Our robust heterogeneous odds ratio estimation method is a simple
and intuitive tool to quantify heterogeneity in patients or customers and
personalize interventions, while lifting a central limitation in many revenue
management data.

to secure smart home networks through K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) based device
classifications and malicious traffic detection. The efficiency is further
enhanced by offloading the computation-intensive KNN model to Field
Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), which offers parallel processing power of GPU
platforms at lower costs and higher efficiencies, and can be used to accelerate
time-sensitive tasks. The proposed parallelization and implementation of KNN on
FPGA are achieved by using the Vivado Design Suite from Xilinx and High-Level
Synthesis (HLS). When optimized with 10-fold cross-validation, the proposed
solution for KNN consistently exhibits the best performances on FPGA when
compared with four alternative KNN instances (i.e., 78% faster than the
parallel bubble sort-based implementation and 99\% faster than the other three
sorting algorithms). Moreover, with 36,225 training samples, the proposed KNN
solution classifies a test query with 95% accuracy in approximately 4
milliseconds on FPGA compared to 57 seconds on a CPU platform.

trust relationship in human-AI interaction. One assumption underlying research
in transparent AI systems is that explanations help to better assess
predictions of machine learning (ML) models, for instance by enabling humans to
identify wrong predictions more efficiently. Recent empirical evidence however
shows that explanations can have the opposite effect: When presenting
explanations of ML predictions humans often tend to trust ML predictions even
when these are wrong. Experimental evidence suggests that this effect can be
attributed to how intuitive, or human, an AI or explanation appears. This
effect challenges the very goal of XAI and implies that responsible usage of
transparent AI methods has to consider the ability of humans to distinguish
machine generated from human explanations. Here we propose a quantitative
metric for XAI methods based on Turing's imitation game, a Turing Test for
Transparency. A human interrogator is asked to judge whether an explanation was
generated by a human or by an XAI method. Explanations of XAI methods that can
not be detected by humans above chance performance in this binary
classification task are passing the test. Detecting such explanations is a
requirement for assessing and calibrating the trust relationship in human-AI
interaction. We present experimental results on a crowd-sourced text

generated explanations. We discuss ethical and practical implications of our
results for applications of transparent ML.

adaptive learning rates can accelerate optimization algorithms. To fill this
gap, in the paper, we propose a novel fast adaptive bilevel framework to solve
stochastic bilevel optimization problems that the outer problem is possibly
nonconvex and the inner problem is strongly convex. Our framework uses unified
adaptive matrices including many types of adaptive learning rates, and can
flexibly use the momentum and variance reduced techniques. In particular, we
provide a useful convergence analysis framework for the bilevel optimization.
Specifically, we propose a fast single-loop adaptive bilevel optimization
(BiAdam) algorithm, which achieves a sample complexity of
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary solution.
Meanwhile, we propose an accelerated version of BiAdam algorithm (VR-BiAdam),
which reaches the best known sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$.
To the best of our knowledge, we first study the adaptive bilevel optimization
methods with adaptive learning rates. Experimental results on data
hyper-cleaning and hyper-representation learning tasks demonstrate the

we compared the performance of traditional word embeddings with SVM, CRF and

ionization to the electric field component of the wave acting on the charged
particles. Tubular plasmas of this type can be obtained over an unmatched range
of operating conditions, namely the frequency of the wave, the inner radius of
the discharge tube, the density and the nature of the carrier gas. The
analytical and numerical modeling of these plasmas has so far generally
consisted in considering the wave and the associated plasma column as a whole,
which amounts to assuming that the plasma column along which the wave
propagates affects the properties of the wave. This is not the case: our
assertion is based on the experimental fact that the axial distribution of the
electron density along a plasma column supported by a surface wave is linear
(constant slope) until its termination, whatever the operating conditions. The
linearity of these plots (from various laboratories) is statistically validated
by linear least-squares regressions that provide a high coefficient of
determination. On the other hand, it is shown that any attempt to incorporate
plasma column characteristics into the SW equations alters the linearity of the
axial electron density profile, particularly towards the end of the column.
This intrinsic linearity results from the transfer of power from the SW to the
discharge gas that it ionizes as if it were a weakly dissipative (passive)
medium. Indeed, the power attenuation coefficient {\alpha}(z) of the guided
wave depends only on ne(z), the axial electron density, such that it is locally
proportional to the power flux (as observed). This requirement is in fact the
expression of the stability (existence) criterion governing the axial power
flow along discharges supported by the propagation of an electromagnetic wave.

focus on path planning problems which are in between -- deterministic, but with
an initial uncertainty on either the target or the running cost on parts of the

choose the optimal trajectory until then. We address this challenge for three
different models of information acquisition: with fixed $T$, discretely
distributed and exponentially distributed random $T$. We develop models and
numerical methods suitable for multiple notions of optimality: based on the
average-case performance, the worst-case performance, the average constrained
by the worst, the average performance with probabilistic constraints on the bad
outcomes, risk-sensitivity, and distributional-robustness. We illustrate our
approach using examples of pursuing random targets identified at a (possibly

on $\partial\Omega$, the modulus $m$ of the curve family connecting $A$ and $B$
in $\Omega$ is equal to the modulus of the curve family connecting the vertical

Moreover, in the case of the rectangle the family of horizontal segments

Pulling these segments back to $\Omega$ via $\psi$ yields a family of extremal
curves (also known as horizontal trajectories) connecting $A$ to $B$ in

by some discrete paths arising from an orthodiagonal approximation of $\Omega$.
Moreover, we show that there is a natural probability mass function (pmf) on

the transverse measure on the set of extremal curves. The key ingredient is an
algorithm that, for an embedded planar graph, takes the current flow between
two sets of nodes, and produces a unique path decomposition with non-crossing
paths. Moreover, some care was taken to adapt recent results for harmonic
convergence on orthodiagonal maps, due to Gurel-Gurevich, Jerison, and
Nachmias, to our context. Finally, we generalize a result of N.~Alrayes from

has mainly focused on static supervised learning tasks such as image
classification. However, DNNs have been used extensively in real-world adaptive
tasks such as reinforcement learning (RL), making such systems vulnerable to
adversarial attacks as well. Prior works in provable robustness in RL seek to
certify the behaviour of the victim policy at every time-step against a
non-adaptive adversary using methods developed for the static setting. But in
the real world, an RL adversary can infer the defense strategy used by the
victim agent by observing the states, actions, etc., from previous time-steps
and adapt itself to produce stronger attacks in future steps. We present an
efficient procedure, designed specifically to defend against an adaptive RL
adversary, that can directly certify the total reward without requiring the
policy to be robust at each time-step. Our main theoretical contribution is to
prove an adaptive version of the Neyman-Pearson Lemma -- a key lemma for
smoothing-based certificates -- where the adversarial perturbation at a
particular time can be a stochastic function of current and previous
observations and states as well as previous actions. Building on this result,
we propose policy smoothing where the agent adds a Gaussian noise to its
observation at each time-step before passing it through the policy function.
Our robustness certificates guarantee that the final total reward obtained by
policy smoothing remains above a certain threshold, even though the actions at
intermediate time-steps may change under the attack. Our experiments on various
environments like Cartpole, Pong, Freeway and Mountain Car show that our method
can yield meaningful robustness guarantees in practice.

for Z2-synchronization as a prototypical example of a high-dimensional Bayesian
model. We show that for any signal strength $\lambda > 1$ (the weak-recovery
threshold), there exists a unique local minimizer of the TAP free energy
functional near the mean of the Bayes posterior law. Furthermore, the TAP free
energy in a local neighborhood of this minimizer is strongly convex.
Consequently, a natural-gradient/mirror-descent algorithm achieves linear
convergence to this minimizer from a local initialization, which may be
obtained by a constant number of iterates of Approximate Message Passing (AMP).
This provides a rigorous foundation for variational inference in high
dimensions via minimization of the TAP free energy.
  We also analyze the finite-sample convergence of AMP, showing that AMP is
asymptotically stable at the TAP minimizer for any $\lambda > 1$, and is
linearly convergent to this minimizer from a spectral initialization for
sufficiently large $\lambda$. Such a guarantee is stronger than results
obtainable by state evolution analyses, which only describe a fixed number of
AMP iterations in the infinite-sample limit.
  Our proofs combine the Kac-Rice formula and Sudakov-Fernique Gaussian
comparison inequality to analyze the complexity of critical points that satisfy
strong convexity and stability conditions within their local neighborhoods.

survey (2000 redshifts deg$^{-2}$). The HectoMAP FoF catalog includes 346
clusters with 10 or more spectroscopic members. We list these clusters and
their members (5992 galaxies with a spectroscopic redshift). We also include
central velocity dispersions ($\sigma_{*, BCG}$) for all of the FoF cluster
BCGs, a distinctive feature of the HectoMAP FoF catalog. HectoMAP clusters with
higher galaxy number density (80 systems) are all genuine clusters with a
strong concentration and a prominent BCG in Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam images.
The phase-space diagrams show the expected elongation along the line-of-sight.
Lower-density systems include some false positives. We establish a connection
between BCGs and their host clusters by demonstrating that
$\sigma_{*,BCG}/\sigma_{cl}$ decreases as a function of cluster velocity
dispersion ($\sigma_{cl}$), in contrast, numerical simulations predict a
constant $\sigma_{*, BCG}/\sigma_{cl}$. Sets of clusters at two different
redshifts show that BCG evolution in massive systems is slow over the redshift
range $z < 0.4$. The data strongly suggest that minor mergers may play an
important role in BCG evolution in these clusters ($\sigma_{cl} \gtrsim 300$ km
s$^{-1}$). For systems of lower mass ($\sigma_{cl} < 300$ km s$^{-1}$), the
data indicate that major mergers may play a significant role. The coordinated
evolution of BCGs and their host clusters provides an interesting test of
simulations in high density regions of the universe.

values obtained via a non-perturbing weak measurement of quantum operators with
a post-selection over a complete set of state vectors basis, which always
satisfies the Kennard-Robertson-Schr\""odinger uncertainty relation. First, we
introduce an auxiliary global random variable and couple it to the imaginary
part of the weak value to transform the incompatibility between the quantum
operator and the basis into the fluctuation of an `error term', and then
superimpose it onto the real-part of the weak value. We show that this class of
``c-valued physical quantities'' provides a real-deterministic contextual
hidden variable model for the quantum expectation value of a certain class of

bounds can be obtained separately by imposing the classical uncertainty
relation to the c-valued physical quantities associated with a pair of
Hermitian operators. Within the representation, the complementarity between two
incompatible quantum observables manifests the absence of a basis wherein the
error terms of the associated two c-valued physical quantities simultaneously
vanish. Furthermore, quantum uncertainty relation is captured by a specific
irreducible epistemic restriction, foreign in classical mechanics, constraining
the allowed form of the joint distribution of the two c-valued physical
quantities. We then suggest an epistemic interpretation of the two terms
decomposing the c-valued physical quantity as the optimal estimate under the

concept of the unknown. Trained neural networks are usually tested in an
unrealistic scenario with only examples from a closed set of known classes. In
an attempt to develop a more realistic model, the concept of working in an open
set environment has been introduced. This in turn leads to the concept of
incremental learning where a model with its own architecture and initial
trained set of data can identify unknown classes during the testing phase and
autonomously update itself if evidence of a new class is detected. Some
problems that arise in incremental learning are inefficient use of resources to
retrain the classifier repeatedly and the decrease of classification accuracy
as multiple classes are added over time. This process of instantiating new
classes is repeated as many times as necessary, accruing errors. To address
these problems, this paper proposes the Classification Confidence Threshold
approach to prime neural networks for incremental learning to keep accuracies
high by limiting forgetting. A lean method is also used to reduce resources
used in the retraining of the neural network. The proposed method is based on
the idea that a network is able to incrementally learn a new class even when
exposed to a limited number samples associated with the new class. This method
can be applied to most existing neural networks with minimal changes to network
architecture.

understanding the structure and dynamics of the cryptoasset at a global scale.
We compiled all the blockchain data of Bitcoin from its genesis to the year
2020, identified users from anonymous addresses of wallets, and constructed
monthly snapshots of networks by focusing on regular users as big players. We
apply the methods of bow-tie structure and Hodge decomposition in order to
locate the users in the upstream, downstream, and core of the entire crypto
flow. Additionally, we reveal principal components hidden in the flow by using
non-negative matrix factorization, which we interpret as a probabilistic model.
We show that the model is equivalent to a probabilistic latent semantic
analysis in natural language processing, enabling us to estimate the number of
such hidden components. Moreover, we find that the bow-tie structure and the
principal components are quite stable among those big players. This study can
be a solid basis on which one can further investigate the temporal change of
crypto flow, entry and exit of big players, and so forth.

  Segmentation",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Coronary X-ray angiography is a crucial clinical procedure for the diagnosis
and treatment of coronary artery disease, which accounts for roughly 16% of
global deaths every year. However, the images acquired in these procedures have
low resolution and poor contrast, making lesion detection and assessment
challenging. Accurate coronary artery segmentation not only helps mitigate
these problems, but also allows the extraction of relevant anatomical features
for further analysis by quantitative methods. Although automated segmentation
of coronary arteries has been proposed before, previous approaches have used
non-optimal segmentation criteria, leading to less useful results. Most methods
either segment only the major vessel, discarding important information from the
remaining ones, or segment the whole coronary tree based mostly on contrast
information, producing a noisy output that includes vessels that are not
relevant for diagnosis. We adopt a better-suited clinical criterion and segment
vessels according to their clinical relevance. Additionally, we simultaneously
perform catheter segmentation, which may be useful for diagnosis due to the
scale factor provided by the catheter's known diameter, and is a task that has
not yet been performed with good results. To derive the optimal approach, we
conducted an extensive comparative study of encoder-decoder architectures
trained on a combination of focal loss and a variant of generalized dice loss.
Based on the EfficientNet and the UNet++ architectures, we propose a line of
efficient and high-performance segmentation models using a new decoder
architecture, the EfficientUNet++, whose best-performing version achieved
average dice scores of 0.8904 and 0.7526 for the artery and catheter classes,
respectively, and an average generalized dice score of 0.9234.

constantly revealed over time and all agents must find collision-free paths to

different categories based on (1) controllability (the set of agents that they
can plan paths for at each time) and (2) rationality (the quality of paths they
plan) and study the relationships between them. We perform a competitive
analysis for each category of online MAPF algorithms with respect to
commonly-used objective functions. We show that a naive algorithm that routes
newly-revealed agents one at a time in sequence achieves a competitive ratio
that is asymptotically bounded from both below and above by the number of
agents with respect to flowtime and makespan. We then show a counter-intuitive
result that, if rerouting of previously-revealed agents is not allowed, any
rational online MAPF algorithms, including ones that plan optimal paths for all
newly-revealed agents, have the same asymptotic competitive ratio as the naive
algorithm, even on 2D 4-neighbor grids. We also derive constant lower bounds on
the competitive ratio of any rational online MAPF algorithms that allow
rerouting. The results thus provide theoretical insights into the effectiveness
of using MAPF algorithms in an online setting for the first time.

to entanglement and Bell nonlocality. However, conceptually different from
entanglement and Bell nonlocality, quantum steering has an asymmetric
definition. Motivated by the asymmetric definition of quantum steering, we
study the steerability of two-interacting qubits, which have asymmetric energy
levels, coupled with asymmetric environments. The asymmetric (nonequilibrium)
environments are two environments with different temperatures or chemical
potentials. The Bloch-Redfield equation is applied to study the dynamics of two
qubits and its long-time behavior. In our study, the steady-state steerability
is determined by an experimentally friendly steering criteria, which
demonstrates steering through the entanglement detection. Our results show that
the steady states of two asymmetric qubits have the advantage for one direction
of steering, compared to the symmetric setup. We also provide analytical
results on the minimal coupling strength between the two qubits in order to be
steerable. The asymmetric steerability is collectively determined by the nature
of the two qubits and the influence from equilibrium or nonequilibrium
environments. Nonequilibrium environments with the cost of nonzero entropy
production can enhance the steerability in one direction. We also show the
strict hierarchy of entanglement, steering and Bell nonlocality of the
nonequilibrium steady states, which shows a richer structure of steering than
entanglement and Bell nonlocality.

The further calculations including the Hubbard U indicate that with modest

pressure and diminishes gradually at high pressure. We thus propose that the
experimentally observed superconductivity in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ at ambient/low
pressures may still belong to the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS)
type but is partially suppressed by the V magnetism, while the
superconductivity under high pressure is fully conventional without invoking

tools. Herein, biologists often need to discard a considerable amount of rich
3D spatial information by compromising on 2D analysis via maximum intensity
projection. Recently, pixel embedding-based cell instance segmentation and
tracking provided a neat and generalizable computing paradigm for understanding
cellular dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel spatial-temporal
voxel-embedding (VoxelEmbed) based learning method to perform simultaneous cell
instance segmenting and tracking on 3D volumetric video sequences. Our
contribution is in four-fold: (1) The proposed voxel embedding generalizes the
pixel embedding with 3D context information; (2) Present a simple multi-stream

Accomplished an end-to-end framework for one-stage 3D cell instance
segmentation and tracking without heavy parameter tuning; (4) The proposed 3D
quantification is memory efficient via a single GPU with 12 GB memory. We
evaluate our VoxelEmbed method on four 3D datasets (with different cell types)
from the ISBI Cell Tracking Challenge. The proposed VoxelEmbed method achieved
consistent superior overall performance (OP) on two densely annotated datasets.
The performance is also competitive on two sparsely annotated cohorts with

demonstrate that the VoxelEmbed method is a generalizable and memory-efficient

problem as scene appearance and camera viewpoint can change significantly when

representations'' have shown promising results as compared to traditional
sequence score aggregation or single image based techniques. In parallel to
these endeavors, 3D point clouds based place recognition is also being explored
following the advances in deep learning based point cloud processing. However,
a key question remains: is an explicit 3D structure based place representation
always superior to an implicit ``spatial'' representation based on sequence of
RGB images which can inherently learn scene structure. In this extended
abstract, we attempt to compare these two types of methods by considering a
similar ``metric span'' to represent places. We compare a 3D point cloud based
method (PointNetVLAD) with image sequence based methods (SeqNet and others) and
showcase that image sequence based techniques approach, and can even surpass,
the performance achieved by point cloud based methods for a given metric span.
These performance variations can be attributed to differences in data richness
of input sensors as well as data accumulation strategies for a mobile robot.
While a perfect apple-to-apple comparison may not be feasible for these two
different modalities, the presented comparison takes a step in the direction of
answering deeper questions regarding spatial representations, relevant to
several applications like Autonomous Driving and Augmented/Virtual Reality.

framework, a perceptual model is trained to recognize whether the wallpapers
produced by the generator network are sufficiently realistic and have the
attribute designated by given perceptual description; these multi-label

continuous multimodal mobile sensing data towards relapse prediction tasks. The
identified clusters could represent different routine behavioral trends related
to daily living of patients as well as atypical behavioral trends associated
with impending relapse.
  We used the mobile sensing data obtained in the CrossCheck project for our
analysis. Continuous data from six different mobile sensing-based modalities
(e.g. ambient light, sound/conversation, acceleration etc.) obtained from a
total of 63 schizophrenia patients, each monitored for up to a year, were used
for the clustering models and relapse prediction evaluation. Two clustering
models, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Partition Around Medoids (PAM), were
used to obtain behavioral representations from the mobile sensing data. The
features obtained from the clustering models were used to train and evaluate a
personalized relapse prediction model using Balanced Random Forest. The
personalization was done by identifying optimal features for a given patient
based on a personalization subset consisting of other patients who are of
similar age.
  The clusters identified using the GMM and PAM models were found to represent
different behavioral patterns (such as clusters representing sedentary days,
active but with low communications days, etc.). Significant changes near the
relapse periods were seen in the obtained behavioral representation features
from the clustering models. The clustering model based features, together with
other features characterizing the mobile sensing data, resulted in an F2 score
of 0.24 for the relapse prediction task in a leave-one-patient-out evaluation
setting. This obtained F2 score is significantly higher than a random
classification baseline with an average F2 score of 0.042.

superconducting qubits because they can lead to energy decay or dephasing upon
tunneling across Josephson junctions (JJs). Here, we investigate the impact of
the intrinsic properties of two-dimensional transmon qubits on quasiparticle
tunneling (QPT) and discuss how we can use quasiparticle dynamics to gain
critical information about the quality of JJ barrier. We find the tunneling
rate of the nonequilibrium quasiparticles to be sensitive to the choice of the
shunting capacitor material and their geometry in qubits. In some devices, we
observe an anomalous temperature dependence of the QPT rate below 100 mK that
deviates from a constant background associated with non-equilibrium
quasiparticles. We speculate that this behavior is caused by high transmission
sites/defects within the oxide barriers of the JJs, leading to spatially
localized subgap states. We model this by assuming that such defects generate
regions with a smaller effective gap. Our results present a unique in situ
characterization tool to assess the uniformity of tunnel barriers in qubit
junctions and shed light on how quasiparticles can interact with various
elements of the qubit circuit.

defined as functions from states to outcomes. But where do the state space and
outcome space come from? Expanding on recent work by Blume, Easley, and Halpern
(BEH), we consider a language-based framework in which actions are identified
with (conditional) descriptions in a simple underlying language, while states
and outcomes (along with probabilities and utilities) are constructed as part
of a representation theorem. Our work expands the role of language from that of
BEH by using it not only for the conditions that determine which actions are
taken, but also the effects. More precisely, we take the set of actions to be
built from those of the form ""do(phi)"", for formulas phi in the underlying
language. This presents a problem: how do we interpret the result of do(phi)
when phi is underspecified (i.e., compatible with multiple states)? We answer
this using tools familiar from the semantics of counterfactuals: roughly
speaking, do(phi) maps each state to the ""closest"" phi-state. This notion of
""closest"" is also something we construct as part of the representation theorem;
in effect, then, we prove that (under appropriate assumptions) the agent is
acting as if each underspecified action is first made definite and then
evaluated (i.e., by maximizing expected utility). Of course, actions in the
real world are often not presented in a fully precise manner, yet agents reason
about and form preferences among them all the same. Our work brings the
abstract tools of decision theory into closer contact with such real-world
scenarios.

investigate different ways of measuring the extent to which a voting method
violates PI, using computer simulations. We consider the probability (under
different probability models for preferences) of PI violations in randomly
drawn profiles vs. profile-coalition pairs (involving coalitions of different

PI and one that does not, we should consider the probability of PI violation
conditional on the voting methods choosing different winners. We should also
relativize the probability of PI violation to what we call voter potency, the
probability that a voter causes a candidate to lose. Although absolute
frequencies of PI violations may be low, after this conditioning and
relativization, we see that under certain voting methods that violate PI, much
of a voter's potency is turned against them - in particular, against their

Two very important components of behavior in this respect are belief and

extending epistemic deontic stit theory with beliefs. On one hand, the

Hence, it is critical to further study such formalizations. Action models, a
significant approach to modeling dynamic epistemic logic, have only recently
been applied to distributed computing, for instance, by Goubault, Ledent, and
Rajsbaum. Using action models for analyzing distributed-computing environments,
as proposed by these authors, has drawbacks, however. In particular, a direct
use of action models may cause such models to grow exponentially as the
computation of the distributed system evolves. Hence, our motivation is finding
compact action models for distributed systems. We introduce communication
pattern models as an extension of both ordinary action models and their update
operator. We give a systematic construction of communication pattern models for
a large variety of distributed-computing models called dynamic-network models.
For a proper subclass of dynamic-network models called oblivious, the
communication pattern model remains the same throughout the computation.

spectrum and lifetime. The emission of PE-emitter can be enhanced resonantly at
the photonic modes as compared to that within the free spectral range. The
spectral shape modulated by photonic modes is independent of the separation
between the PS sphere and PE-emitter. The band integral of the fluorescence
decay rate can be enhanced or suppressed after the PS sphere couples to the
PE-emitters, depending on the coupling strength between the plasmonic antenna

that gradient with momentum contains more accurate directional information and
therefore its second moment estimation is a more favorable option for learning

TYpicalPre-main seqUence Stars (PLATYPUS) survey. We detect all four targets
with a characteristic beam size of 5 arcseconds and derive a grain size
distribution parameter that is consistent with collisional cascade models and
theoretical predictions for parent planetesimal bodies where binding is
dominated by self-gravity. We combine our sample with 19 other
millimetre-wavelength detected debris discs from the literature and calculate a
weighted mean grain size power law index which is close to analytical
predictions for a classical steady state collisional cascade model. We suggest
the possibility of two distributions of q in our debris disc sample; a broad
distribution (where q is approximately 3.2 to 3.7) for ""typical"" debris discs
(gas-poor/non-detection), and a narrow distribution (where q is less than 3.2)
for bright gas-rich discs. Or alternatively, we suggest that there exists an
observational bias between the grain size distribution parameter and absolute
flux which may be attributed to the detection rates of faint debris discs at cm
wavelengths.

semi-supervised learning, which is a learning scheme in which the scarce labels

semi-supervised learning, which are the manifold assumption, cluster

semi-supervised learning approaches. In particular, the methods in regard to
using deep neural networks in a semi-supervised learning setting are primarily
discussed. In addition, the existing works are first classified based on the

the statistical structure of temperature and velocity space/time fluctuations
is of paramount importance to construct models of chemical reaction (in
chemistry), of condensation of virus-containing droplets (in virology and/or

matter of fact, results of turbulence in a puff are confined to bulk properties
(i.e. average puff velocity and typical decay/growth time) and dates back to
the second half of the 20th century. There is thus a huge gap to fill to pass
from bulk properties to two-point statistical observables. Here we fill this
gap exploiting theory and numerics in concert to predict and validate the
space/time scaling behaviors of both velocity and temperature structure
functions including intermittency corrections. Excellent agreement between
theory and simulations is found. Our results are expected to have profound
impact to develop evaporation models for virus-containing droplets carried by a

non-overlapping segments that may have nonlinear and complex structures. In
general, it is formulated as a discrete optimization problem with combinatorial
constraints. A popular algorithm for optimally solving this problem is dynamic
programming (DP), which has quadratic computation and memory requirements.
Given that sequences in practice are too long, this algorithm is not a
practical approach. Although many heuristic algorithms have been proposed to
approximate the optimal segmentation, they have no guarantee on the quality of
their solutions. In this paper, we take a differentiable approach to alleviate
the aforementioned issues. First, we introduce a novel sigmoid-based
regularization to smoothly approximate the combinatorial constraints. Combining
it with objective of the balanced kernel clustering, we formulate a
differentiable model termed Kernel clustering with sigmoid-based regularization
(KCSR), where the gradient-based algorithm can be exploited to obtain the
optimal segmentation. Second, we develop a stochastic variant of the proposed
model. By using the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, which has much lower
time and space complexities, for optimization, the second model can perform
segmentation on overlong data sequences. Finally, for simultaneously segmenting
multiple data sequences, we slightly modify the sigmoid-based regularization to
further introduce an extended variant of the proposed model. Through extensive
experiments on various types of data sequences performances of our models are
evaluated and compared with those of the existing methods. The experimental
results validate advantages of the proposed models. Our Matlab source code is

devising an iterative and data-agnostic manner in utilizing ZEROS for NAS, our
novel trial leads to a framework called training free differentiable

eliminating the need for hand-tuning separate modules and allowing joint

  Knowledge",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Treatment effect estimation from observational data is a fundamental problem
in causal inference. There are two very different schools of thought that have
tackled this problem. On one hand, Pearlian framework commonly assumes
structural knowledge (provided by an expert) in form of directed acyclic graphs
and provides graphical criteria such as back-door criterion to identify valid
adjustment sets. On other hand, potential outcomes (PO) framework commonly
assumes that all observed features satisfy ignorability (i.e., no hidden
confounding), which in general is untestable. In prior works that attempted to
bridge these frameworks, there is an observational criteria to identify an
anchor variable and if a subset of covariates (not involving the anchor
variable) passes a suitable conditional independence criteria, then that subset
is a valid back-door. Our main result strengthens these prior results by
showing that under a different expert-driven structural knowledge -- that one
variable is a direct causal parent of treatment variable -- remarkably, testing
for subsets (not involving the known parent variable) that are valid back-doors
is equivalent to an invariance test. Importantly, we also cover the non-trivial
case where entire set of observed features is not ignorable (generalizing the
PO framework) without requiring knowledge of all parents of treatment variable.
Our key technical idea involves generation of a synthetic sub-sampling (or
environment) variable that is a function of the known parent variable. In
addition to designing an invariance test, this sub-sampling variable allows us
to leverage Invariant Risk Minimization, and thus, connects finding valid
adjustments (in non-ignorable observational setting) to representation
learning. We demonstrate effectiveness and tradeoffs of our approaches on a
variety of synthetic data as well as real causal effect estimation benchmarks.

``the instance does not belong to these complementary labels"". Since the
probability of selecting a true label as a complementary label is low, NT
provides less noisy information. Furthermore, the model trained with NT is able
to separate the noisy data from the training data. Based on NT, we propose a
sentence-level framework, SENT, for distant relation extraction. SENT not only
filters the noisy data to construct a cleaner dataset, but also performs a
re-labeling process to transform the noisy data into useful training data, thus
further benefiting the model's performance. Experimental results show the

  partitions: $n+3$ pairs of equivalent statistics","revision",,,,"math.CO math-ph math.MP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  There is the same number of $n \times n$ alternating sign matrices (ASMs) as
there is of descending plane partitions (DPPs) with parts no greater than $n$,
but finding an explicit bijection is an open problem for about $40$ years now.
So far, quadruples of statistics on ASMs and on DPPs that have the same joint
distribution have been identified. We introduce extensions of ASMs and of DPPs
along with $n+3$ statistics on each extension, and show that the two families
of statistics have the same joint distribution. The ASM-DPP equinumerosity is
obtained as an easy consequence by considering the $(-1)$-enumerations of these
extended objects with respect to one pair of the $n+3$ pairs of statistics. One
may speculate that the fact that these extensions might be necessary to have
this significance increase in the number of statistics, as well as the
involvement of signs when specializing to ASMs and DPPs may hint at the
obstacles in finding an explicit bijection between ASMs and DPPs. One important
tool for our proof is a multivariate generalization of the operator formula for
the number of monotone triangles with prescribed bottom row that generalizes
Schur functions.

decade. This problem, which is at the base of the security of public-key
cryptosystems based on rank metric codes, is traditionally studied over finite
fields. But the recent generalizations of certain classes of rank-metric codes
from finite fields to finite rings have naturally created the interest to
tackle the rank decoding problem in the case of finite rings. In this paper, we
show that solving the rank decoding problem over finite principal ideal rings
is at least as hard as the rank decoding problem over finite fields. We also
show that computing the minimum rank distance for linear codes over finite
principal ideal rings is equivalent to the same problem for linear codes over
finite fields. Finally, we provide combinatorial type algorithms for solving
the rank decoding problem over finite chain rings together with their average

multiple devices to train models locally and formulate a global model, without
sharing the clients' local data. A federated learning system can be viewed as a
large-scale distributed system, involving different components and stakeholders
with diverse requirements and constraints. Hence, developing a federated
learning system requires both software system design thinking and machine
learning knowledge. Although much effort has been put into federated learning
from the machine learning perspectives, our previous systematic literature
review on the area shows that there is a distinct lack of considerations for
software architecture design for federated learning. In this paper, we propose
FLRA, a reference architecture for federated learning systems, which provides a
template design for federated learning-based solutions. The proposed FLRA
reference architecture is based on an extensive review of existing patterns of
federated learning systems found in the literature and existing industrial
implementation. The FLRA reference architecture consists of a pool of
architectural patterns that could address the frequently recurring design
problems in federated learning architectures. The FLRA reference architecture
can serve as a design guideline to assist architects and developers with
practical solutions for their problems, which can be further customised.

loadings. However, this agreement is highly degraded when they are used in the

loads is scarce. In particular, models that are identified in tension or
compression often overestimate the response in shear. One difficulty lies in
the fact that 3D models must aggregate different physical modeling, described
with different kinematics. This requires the use of transport operators complex
to manipulate. In this paper, we propose a mechanical model for large strains,
generalized in 3D, and precisely introducing the adequate transport operators
in order to obtain an exact kinematic. The stress strain duality is validated
in the writing of the power of internal forces. This generalized model is
applied in the case of a polycarbonate amorphous polymers. The simulation
results in tension/compression and shear are compared with the classical

distributions (SEDs) using the X-CIGALE code. X-CIGALE allows the fitting of
X-ray flux and accounts for the viewing angle of dusty torus and the
attenuation from polar dust. By selecting matched type 1 and 2 subsamples in
the X-ray luminosity and redshift parameter space, we find that both types live
in galaxies with similar star formation. However, type 2 AGN tend to reside in
more massive systems ($10.87^{+0.06}_{-0.12}\,\rm M_\odot$) compared to their
type 1 counterparts ($10.57^{+0.20}_{-0.12}\,\rm M_\odot$). In the second part
of our analysis, we compare the spectroscopic classification with that from the
SED fitting. X-CIGALE successfully identifies all spectroscopic type 2 sources
either by estimating an inclination angle that corresponds to edge on viewing
of the source or by measuring increased polar dust in these systems. $\sim
85\%$ of spectroscopic type 1 AGN are also identified as such, based on the SED
fitting analysis. There is a small number of sources ($\sim 15\%$ of the
sample), that present broad lines in their spectra, but show strong indications
of obscuration, based on SED analysis. These, could be systems that are viewed
face on and have an extended dust component along the polar direction. The
performance of X-CIGALE in classifying AGN is similar at low and high
redshifts, under the condition that there is sufficient photometric coverage.
Finally, usage of optical/mid-IR colour criteria to identify optical red AGN
(${\it{u}}-\rm W3$), suggests that these criteria are better suited for IR
selected AGN and their efficiency drops for the low to moderate luminosity

nonlinearity parameter. At large signal-to-noise power ratio we calculate the
conditional entropy, the output signal entropy, and the mutual information in
the leading and next-to-leading order in the nonlinearity parameter and in the
leading order in the parameter $1/\mathrm{SNR}$. Using the mutual information

  Our calculations seem to exhibit several unexpected patterns. Mainly, we
conjecture that certain indecomposable statistics generate the whole ring, and
indeed prove this for statistics associated with matrices consisting of up to 2

(SMGs) reveal fascinatingly complex morphologies. This raises a number of
questions: how does the relative orientation of a galaxy affect its observed
submillimetre emission, and does this result in an `orientation bias' in the
selection and analysis of such galaxies in flux-limited cosmological surveys?
We investigated these questions using the \textsc{Simba} cosmological
simulation paired with the dust radiative transfer code \textsc{Powderday}. We
selected eight simulated SMGs ($S_{850}\gtrsim2$ mJy) at $z = 2$, and measured
the variance of their `observed' emission over 50 random orientations. Each
galaxy exhibits significant scatter in its emission close to the peak of the
thermal dust emission, with variation in flux density of up to a factor of 2.7.
This results in an appreciable dispersion in the inferred dust temperatures and
infrared luminosities ($16^{\mathrm{th}}-84^{\mathrm{th}}$ percentile ranges of
5\,K and 0.1\,dex, respectively) and therefore a fundamental uncertainty in
derived parameters such as dust mass and star formation rate ($\sim$30% for the
latter using simple calibrations). Using a Monte Carlo simulation we also
assessed the impact of orientation on flux-limited surveys, finding a bias in
the selection of SMGs towards those with face--on orientations, as well as
those at lower redshifts. We predict that the orientation bias will affect
flux-limited single-dish surveys, most significantly at THz frequencies, and
this bias should be taken into account when placing the results of targeted
follow--up studies in a statistical context.

cross-view and temporal correspondences correctly even when several human pose
estimations are noisy. Compare to previous solutions that construct 3D poses
from multiple views, our approach takes advantage of temporal consistency to
match the 2D poses estimated with previously constructed 3D skeletons in every
view. Therefore cross-view and temporal associations are accomplished
simultaneously. Since the performance suffers from mistaken association and
noisy predictions, we design two strategies for aiming better correspondences
and 3D reconstruction. Specifically, we propose a part-aware measurement for
2D-3D association and a filter that can cope with 2D outliers during
reconstruction. Our approach is efficient and effective comparing to
state-of-the-art methods; it achieves competitive results on two benchmarks:
96.8% on Campus and 97.4% on Shelf. Moreover, we extends the length of Campus
evaluation frames to be more challenging and our proposal also reach

which aims to assign multiple possible labels to an image. In recent years,
many deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based approaches have been
proposed which model label correlations to discover semantics of labels and
learn semantic representations of images. This paper advances this research
direction by improving both the modeling of label correlations and the learning
of semantic representations. On the one hand, besides the local semantics of
each label, we propose to further explore global semantics shared by multiple
labels. On the other hand, existing approaches mainly learn the semantic
representations at the last convolutional layer of a CNN. But it has been noted
that the image representations of different layers of CNN capture different
levels or scales of features and have different discriminative abilities. We
thus propose to learn semantic representations at multiple convolutional
layers. To this end, this paper designs a Multi-layered Semantic Representation
Network (MSRN) which discovers both local and global semantics of labels
through modeling label correlations and utilizes the label semantics to guide
the semantic representations learning at multiple layers through an attention
mechanism. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets including VOC 2007,
COCO, NUS-WIDE, and Apparel show a competitive performance of the proposed MSRN
against state-of-the-art models.

epitaxial growth followed by hydrogenation. Combining scanning tunneling
microscopy observations with density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations, we
reveal that an atomic-hydrogen layer intercalates between graphene and
Ru(0001). The result is a hydrogen honeycomb structure that serves as a
template for the final hydrogenation, which converts the graphene into graphane
only over the template, yielding honeycomb-patterned hydrogenated graphene
(HPHG). In effect, HPHG is a form of patterned graphane. DFT calculations find
that the unhydrogenated graphene regions embedded in the patterned graphane
exhibit spin-polarized edge states. This type of growth mechanism provides new
pathways for the fabrication of intrinsically patterned graphene-based
materials.

observed in the edge plasma of the JET tokamak. Although PTMs are well
documented, little is known about the mechanisms which produce these
structures. In the case of the PTM, an ELM-postcursor, its genesis is usually
explained by ergodisation of the magnetic field due to edge localized modes and
the appearance of a seed magnetic island which evolves into a PTM later. In
this study we try to invoke a creation mechanism based on the concepts and
observations in edge plasma turbulence. An interesting aspect of plasma
turbulence is the occurrence of coherent, long-lived structures in the
scrape-off-layer (SOL). These localized and magnetic-field-aligned regions with
higher or lower plasma densities are called blobs and holes. Measurements show
that these filaments carry parallel currents. We thus here interpret
ELM-filaments as massive blobs and the interspace between these filaments as
holes. We demonstrate that a forward-modelled closed current filament on a q=3
surface produces similar magnetic fluctuations as measured by the JET in-vessel
magnetic pickup coils if a PTM is present. From that we deduce that if a hole
is captured on a q=3 surface after an ELM-crash, a PTM equivalent signature is
generated. If the ELM-filament itself is captured on a q=4 surface, a signature
equivalent to an outer mode appears.

need for simple and efficient prevention strategies that can be rapidly

of antimicrobial properties and are well described for the prevention of
bacterial infections. However, their effect on many viruses has not been
studied in depth. In the context of COVID-19, several surfaces, including
copper (Cu) and silver (Ag) coatings have been described as efficient antiviral
measures that can easily be implemented to slow viral transmission. In this
study, we detected antiviral properties against Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) on surfaces, which were coated with Cu by
magnetron sputtering. However, no effect of Ag on viral titers was observed, in
clear contrast to its well-known antibacterial properties. Further enhancement
of Ag ion release kinetics based on an electrochemical sacrificial anode
mechanism did not increase antiviral activity. These results clearly
demonstrate that Cu and Ag thin film systems display significant differences in
antiviral and antibacterial properties which need to be considered upon

synthesizer creates a program that matches a set of given examples. In many
applications of such synthesis (e.g., program repair or reverse engineering),
we are to reconstruct a program that is close to a specific target program, not
merely to produce some program that satisfies the seen examples. In such
settings, we wish that the synthesized program generalizes well, i.e., has as
few errors as possible on the unobserved examples capturing the target function
behavior. In this paper, we propose the first framework (called SynGuar) for
PBE synthesizers that guarantees to achieve low generalization error with high
probability. Our main contribution is a procedure to dynamically calculate how
many additional examples suffice to theoretically guarantee generalization. We
show how our techniques can be used in 2 well-known synthesis approaches: PROSE
and STUN (synthesis through unification), for common string-manipulation
program benchmarks. We find that often a few hundred examples suffice to
provably bound generalization error below $5\%$ with high ($\geq 98\%$)
probability on these benchmarks. Further, we confirm this empirically: SynGuar
significantly improves the accuracy of existing synthesizers in generating the
right target programs. But with fewer examples chosen arbitrarily, the same
baseline synthesizers (without SynGuar) overfit and lose accuracy.

Previous character-based and radical-based methods have not fundamentally
addressed the zero-shot problem since some characters or radicals in test sets
may not appear in training sets under a data-hungry condition. Inspired by the
fact that humans can generalize to know how to write characters unseen before

stroke-based method by decomposing each character into a sequence of strokes,
which are the most basic units of Chinese characters. However, we observe that
there is a one-to-many relationship between stroke sequences and Chinese
characters. To tackle this challenge, we employ a matching-based strategy to
transform the predicted stroke sequence to a specific character. We evaluate
the proposed method on handwritten characters, printed artistic characters, and
scene characters. The experimental results validate that the proposed method
outperforms existing methods on both character zero-shot and radical zero-shot

homogeneously derived by the Gaia-ESO Survey (GES). We derive possibly
undepleted 7Li abundances for 26 OCs and star forming regions with ages from
young to old spanning a large range of Galactocentric distances, which allows
us to reconstruct the local late Galactic evolution of lithium as well as its
current abundance gradient along the disc. Field stars are added to look
further back in time and to constrain 7Li evolution in other Galactic
components. The data are then compared to theoretical tracks from chemical
evolution models that implement different 7Li forges. We find that the upper
envelope of the 7Li abundances measured in field stars of nearly solar
metallicities traces very well the level of lithium enrichment attained by the
ISM as inferred from observations of cluster stars. We confirm previous
findings that the abundance of 7Li in the solar neighbourhood does not decrease
at supersolar metallicity. The comparison of the data with the chemical
evolution model predictions favours a scenario in which the majority of the 7Li
abundance in meteorites comes from novae. Current data also seem to suggest
that the nova rate flattens out at later times. This requirement might have
implications for the masses of the white dwarf nova progenitors and deserves
further investigation. Neutrino-induced reactions taking place in core-collapse
supernovae also produce some fresh lithium. This likely makes a negligible
contribution to the meteoritic abundance, but could be responsible for a mild
increase of the 7Li abundance in the ISM of low-metallicity systems that would
counterbalance the astration processes.

Some
studies have shown that the tilt coefficient is anti-correlated with the cycle
strength. If the anti-correlation exists, it will be shown to act as an
effective nonlinearity of the BL-type dynamo to modulate the solar cycle.
However, some studies have shown that the anti-correlation has no statistical
significance. We aim to investigate the causes behind the controversial results
of tilt angle studies and to establish whether the tilt coefficient is indeed
anti-correlated with the cycle strength. We first analyzed the tilt angles from
DPD. Based on the methods applied in previous studies, we took two criteria to
select the data, along with the linear and square-root functions to describe
Joy's law, and three methods to derive the tilt coefficients for cycles 21-24.
This allowed us to evaluate different methods based on comparisons of the
differences among the tilt coefficients and the tilt coefficient uncertainties.
Then we utilized Monte Carlo experiments to verify the results. Finally, we
extended these methods to analyze the separate hemispheric DPD data and the
tilt angle data from Kodaikanal and Mount Wilson. The tilt angles exhibit an
extremely wide scatter due to both the intrinsic mechanism for its generation
and measurement errors, for instance, the unipolar regions included in data
sets. Different methods to deal with the uncertainties are mainly responsible
for the controversial character of the previous results. The linear fit to the
tilt-latitude relation of sunspot groups with $\Delta s>2.5$ of a cycle carried
out without binning the data can minimize the effect of the tilt scatter on the
uncertainty of the tilt coefficient. Based on this method the tilt angle
coefficient is anti-correlated with the cycle strength with strong statistical
significance.

the CSM structure deviates from a smooth distribution expected from the
steady-state mass loss in the very vicinity of the SN (~10^{15} cm), which is
then connected to the outer smooth distribution (~10^{16} cm). This structure
is further confirmed through the light curve modeling of the whole radio data
set as combined with data at lower frequency previously reported. Being an
explosion of a bare carbon-oxygen (C+O) star having a fast wind, we can trace
the mass-loss history of the progenitor of SN 2020oi in the final year. The
inferred non-smooth CSM distribution corresponds to fluctuations on the
sub-year time scale in the mass-loss history toward the SN explosion. Our
finding suggests that the pre-SN activity is likely driven by the accelerated
change in the nuclear burning stage in the last moments just before the massive
star's demise. The structure of the CSM derived in this study is beyond the
applicability of the other methods at optical wavelengths, highlighting an

is governed by the solution of a free boundary problem for a reaction-diffusion
equation. At long times the particle density approaches a spherically symmetric
steady state solution with a compact support. Here we study fluctuations of the
``swarm of bees"" due to the random character of the branching Brownian motion
in the limit of large but finite $N$. We consider a one-dimensional setting and
focus on two fluctuating quantities: the swarm center of mass $X(t)$ and the
swarm radius $\ell(t)$. Linearizing a pertinent Langevin equation around the
deterministic steady state solution, we calculate the two-time covariances of
$X(t)$ and $\ell(t)$. The variance of $X(t)$ directly follows from the
covariance of $X(t)$, and it scales as $1/N$ as to be expected from the law of
large numbers. The variance of $\ell(t)$ behaves differently: it exhibits an
anomalous scaling $\ln N/N$. This anomaly appears because all spatial scales,
including a narrow region near the edges of the swarm where only a few
particles are present, give a significant contribution to the variance. We
argue that the variance of $\ell(t)$ can be obtained from the covariance of
$\ell(t)$ by introducing a cutoff at the microscopic time $1/N$ where the
continuum Langevin description breaks down. Our theoretical predictions are in
good agreement with Monte-Carlo simulations of the microscopic model.

notoriously prone to micro-instabilities. For a dilute ultrarelativistic
infinite beam, the dominant instability is a mixed mode between longitudinal
two-stream and transverse filamentation modes, with a phase velocity oblique to
the beam velocity. A spatiotemporal theory describing the linear growth of this
oblique mixed instability is proposed, which predicts that spatiotemporal
effects generally prevail for finite-length beams, leading to a significantly
slower instability evolution than in the usually assumed purely temporal
regime. These results are accurately supported by particle-in-cell (PIC)
simulations. Furthermore, we show that the self-focusing dynamics caused by the
plasma wakefields driven by finite-width beams can compete with the oblique
instability. Analyzed through PIC simulations, the interplay of these two
processes in realistic systems bears important implications for upcoming
accelerator experiments on ultrarelativistic beam-plasma interactions.

problems in the modern iron and steel industry. Normally, the supply of the

developed an oxygen optimal distribution model considering uncertain demands

uncertainty set that protects the initial distribution decisions with low
conservatism. The main goal of the TSRO model is to make wait-and-see decisions
maximizing production profits and make here-and-now decisions minimizing
operational stability and surplus/shortage penalty. To represent the
uncertainty set of energy demands, we developed a Gaussian process (GP)-based

capacity-constrained scheduling model to generate multi-scenario energy demands
of discrete processes. We carried out extensive computational studies on TSRO

for their conceptual simplicity and efficiency. However, maintaining functional
diversity between ensemble members that are independently trained with gradient
descent is challenging. This can lead to pathologies when adding more ensemble
members, such as a saturation of the ensemble performance, which converges to
the performance of a single model. Moreover, this does not only affect the
quality of its predictions, but even more so the uncertainty estimates of the
ensemble, and thus its performance on out-of-distribution data. We hypothesize
that this limitation can be overcome by discouraging different ensemble members
from collapsing to the same function. To this end, we introduce a kernelized
repulsive term in the update rule of the deep ensembles. We show that this
simple modification not only enforces and maintains diversity among the members

proper Bayesian inference. Namely, we show that the training dynamics of our

and are often used to trace the dark-matter content in external galaxies. At
the same time, PNe can also be used as probes of their host galaxy stellar
populations and to help understanding the later stages of stellar evolution.
Previous works have indicated that specific number of PNe per stellar
luminosity can vary across different galaxies and as a function of
stellar-population properties, for instance increasing with decreasing stellar
metallicity.
  Aims. In this study we further explore the importance of stellar metallicity
in driving the properties of the PNe population in early-type galaxies, using
three edge-on galaxies in the Fornax cluster offering a clear view into their
predominantly metal-rich and metal-poor regions near the equatorial plane or
both below and above it, respectively .
  Methods. Using VLT-MUSE integral-field observations and dedicated PNe
detection procedures, we construct the PNe luminosity function and compute the
luminosity-specific number of PNe alpha in both in- and off-plane regions of
our edge-on systems.
  Results. Comparing these alpha values with metallicity measurements also
based on the same MUSE data, we find no evidence for an increase in the
specific abundance of PNe when transitioning between metal-rich and metal-poor
regions.
  Conclusions. Our analysis highlights the importance of ensuring spatial
consistency to avoid misleading results when investigating the link between PNe
and their parent stellar populations and suggest that in passively-evolving
systems variations in the specific number of PNe may pertain to rather extreme
metallicity regimes found either in the innermost or outermost regions of
galaxies.

large couplings). Finally, we interpret these results as bounds on the

reaction networks only consider chemostats as free-energy sources sustaining
nonequilibrium behaviours. Here, we extend the theory to include incoherent
light as a source of free energy. We do so by relying on a local equilibrium
assumption to derive the chemical potential of photons relative to the system
they interact with. This allows us to identify the thermodynamic potential and
the thermodynamic forces driving light-reacting chemical systems out of
equilibrium. We use this framework to treat two paradigmatic photochemical
mechanisms describing light-induced unimolecular reactions -- namely the
adiabatic and diabatic mechanisms -- and highlight the different thermodynamics
they lead to. Furthermore, using a thermodynamic coarse-graining procedure, we
express our findings in terms of commonly measured experimental quantities such

formula for the apparent surface charge (ASC), as well as for the electric
field, generated by a molecular charge distribution in aqueous solution. The
approximation, with no fitted parameters, is tested against numerical solutions
of the Poisson equation, where it yields a significant speed-up. For neutral
small molecules, the hydration free energies estimated from the closed-form ASC
formula are within 0.8 kcal/mol RMSD from the numerical Poisson reference; the
electric field at the surface is in quantitative agreement with the reference.
Performance of the approximation is also tested on larger structures, including
a protein, a DNA fragment, and a viral receptor-target complex. For all
structures tested, a near quantitative agreement with the numerical Poisson
reference is achieved, except in regions of high negative curvature, where the
new approximation is still qualitatively correct. A unique efficiency feature
of the proposed ""source-based"" closed-form approximation is that the ASC and
electric field can be estimated individually at any point or surface patch,
without the need to obtain the full global solution. An open source software
implementation of the method is available:

isolated galaxies, comparing the expected gravitational acceleration given the
baryonic matter with the observed gravitational acceleration, using weak
lensing measurements from the fourth data release of the Kilo-Degree Survey.
These measurements extend the radial acceleration relation (RAR) by 2 decades
into the low-acceleration regime beyond the outskirts of the observable galaxy.
We compare our RAR measurements to the predictions of two modified gravity (MG)
theories: MOND and Verlinde's emergent gravity. We find that the measured RAR
agrees well with the MG predictions. In addition, we find a difference of at
least $6\sigma$ between the RARs of early- and late-type galaxies (split by
S\'{e}rsic index and $u-r$ colour) with the same stellar mass. Current MG
theories involve a gravity modification that is independent of other galaxy
properties, which would be unable to explain this behaviour. The difference
might be explained if only the early-type galaxies have significant ($M_{gas}
\approx M_*$) circumgalactic gaseous haloes. The observed behaviour is also
expected in $\Lambda$CDM models where the galaxy-to-halo mass relation depends
on the galaxy formation history. We find that MICE, a $\Lambda$CDM simulation
with hybrid halo occupation distribution modelling and abundance matching,
reproduces the observed RAR but significantly differs from BAHAMAS, a
hydrodynamical cosmological galaxy formation simulation. Our results are
sensitive to the amount of circumgalactic gas; current observational
constraints indicate that the resulting corrections are likely moderate.
Measurements of the lensing RAR with future cosmological surveys will be able
to further distinguish between MG and $\Lambda$CDM models if systematic
uncertainties in the baryonic mass distribution around galaxies are reduced.

multi-agent networks, there is still lack of an efficient algorithm to achieve
the goal of distributed optimization at a pre-specified time. Herein, we design
a specified-time distributed optimization algorithm for connected agents with
directed topologies to collectively minimize the sum of individual objective
functions subject to an equality constraint. With the designed algorithm, the
settling time of distributed optimization can be exactly predefined. The
specified selection of such a settling time is independent of not only the
initial conditions of agents, but also the algorithm parameters and the
communication topologies. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can realize
specified-time optimization by exchanging information among neighbours only at
discrete sampling instants and thus reduces the communication burden. In
addition, the equality constraint is always satisfied during the whole process,
which makes the proposed algorithm applicable to online solving distributed
optimization problems such as economic dispatch. For the special case of
undirected communication topologies, a reduced-order algorithm is also
designed. Finally, the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis is justified
by numerical simulations.

the underlying graph, was acknowledged for its interest in optimizing or
suppressing transport on specific topologies. We argue that the
quantum-classical distance, a figure of merit which was introduced to capture
the difference in dynamics between a CTQW and its classical, stochastic
counterpart, guides the optimization of parameters of the Hamiltonian to
achieve better quantum transport on cycle graphs and spatial search to the
quantum speed limit without an oracle on complete graphs, the latter also
implying fast uniform mixing. We compare the variations of this quantity with
the 1-norm of coherence and the Inverse Participation Ratio, showing that the
quantum-classical distance is linked to both, but in a topology-dependent
relation, which is key to spot the most interesting quantum evolution in each

framework provides a well-studied foundation for learning models that are
specifically tailored to such a loss function and recent research attests the
ability to achieve high predictive accuracy in the multi-label setting. The
utilization of second-order derivatives, as used by many recent boosting
approaches, helps to guide the minimization of non-decomposable losses, due to
the information about pairs of labels it incorporates into the optimization
process. On the downside, this comes with high computational costs, even if the
number of labels is small. In this work, we address the computational
bottleneck of such approach -- the need to solve a system of linear equations
-- by integrating a novel approximation technique into the boosting procedure.
Based on the derivatives computed during training, we dynamically group the
labels into a predefined number of bins to impose an upper bound on the
dimensionality of the linear system. Our experiments, using an existing

we demonstrate the processes involved in the transition from purely interface
sliding at the nanoscale to the situation where at least one of the sliding
bodies undergoes some plastic deformation. For sliding of micrometer-scale
diamond spherical tips on metallic substrates, additional local plastic
yielding of the substrate resulting from tangential tractions causes the tip to
sink into the surface, increasing the contact area in the direction of loading
and resulting in a static friction coefficient higher than the kinetic during
ploughing. This sink-in is largely absent in fused silica, and no friction drop
is observed, along with lower friction in general. The transition from sinking
in within the static friction regime to ploughing in the sliding friction
regime is mediated by failure of the contact interface, indicated by a sharp
increase in energy dissipation. At lower contact pressures, the elastic
interfacial sliding behaviour characteristic of scanning probe or surface force
apparatus experiments is recovered, bridging the gap between the exotic realm
of nanotribology and plasticity dominated macroscale friction. We delineate the
material and geometric factors which determine the transition. We also find
that some unexpected light is cast on the origins of the difference between

the properties of superconductors. In the surface superconducting state (SSS),
increase of the current beyond the surface critical current $I_c$ leads to
breakdown of SSS and penetration of external magnetic field into the sample
bulk. An interesting free-of-bulk system in SSS is offered by thin-walled
superconducting cylinders. The critical state model (CSM) asserts the ac
susceptibility $\chi$ to exhibit jumps as a function of the external ac field
amplitude $H_{ac}$, because of the periodic destruction and restoration of SSS
in the cylinder wall. Here, we investigate experimentally the low-frequency
(128-8192\,Hz) ac response of thin-walled superconducting cylinders in
superimposed dc and ac magnetic fields applied parallel to the cylinder axis.
Distinct from the CSM predictions, experiments reveal that $\chi$ is a smooth
function of $H_{ac}$. For the explanation of our observations we propose a
phenomenological model of partial penetration of magnetic flux (PPMF). The PPMF
model implies that after a restoration of the superconducting state, the
magnetic fields inside and outside the cylinder are not equal, and the value of
the penetrating flux is random for each penetration. This model fits very well
to the experimental data on the temperature dependence of the first-harmonic
$\chi_1$ at any $H_{ac}$ and dc field magnitude. However, in a certain
temperature range the values of physical parameters deduced within the
framework of the PPMF model are questionable.

intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), due to its absence of ability to
transmit/receive pilot signals as well as the huge number of channel
coefficients associated with its reflecting elements. Recently, a breakthrough
was made in reducing the channel estimation overhead by revealing that the
IRS-BS (base station) channels are common in the cascaded user-IRS-BS channels
of all the users, and if the cascaded channel of one typical user is estimated,
the other users' cascaded channels can be estimated very quickly based on their
correlation with the typical user's channel \cite{b5}. One limitation of this
strategy, however, is the waste of user energy, because many users need to keep
silent when the typical user's channel is estimated. In this paper, we reveal
another correlation hidden in the cascaded user-IRS-BS channels by observing
that the user-IRS channel is common in all the cascaded channels from users to
each BS antenna as well. Building upon this finding, we propose a novel
two-phase channel estimation protocol in the uplink communication.
Specifically, in Phase I, the correlation coefficients between the channels of
a typical BS antenna and those of the other antennas are estimated; while in
Phase II, the cascaded channel of the typical antenna is estimated. In
particular, all the users can transmit throughput Phase I and Phase II. Under
this strategy, it is theoretically shown that the minimum number of time
instants required for perfect channel estimation is the same as that of the
aforementioned strategy in the ideal case without BS noise. Then, in the case
with BS noise, we show by simulation that the channel estimation error of our
proposed scheme is significantly reduced thanks to the full exploitation of the
user energy.

transition systems in concurrency theory taking into account to which degree
various actions commute. Mathematically, they take the form of labelled cubical
complexes. It is important to know, and challenging from a
geometric/topological perspective, whether the space of directed paths
(executions in the model) between two vertices (states) is connected; more
generally, to estimate higher connectedness of these path spaces.
  This paper presents an approach for such an estimation for particularly
simple HDA modelling the access of a number of processors to a number of
resources with given limited capacity each. It defines a spare capacity for a
concurrent program with prescribed periods of access of the processors to the
resources. It shows that the connectedness of spaces of directed paths can be
estimated (from above) by spare capacities. Moreover, spare capacities can also
be used to detect deadlocks and critical states in such a HDA.
  The key theoretical ingredient is a transition from the calculation of local
connectedness bounds (of the upper links of vertices of an HDA) to global ones
by applying a version of the nerve lemma due to Anders Bj\""orner.

Primordial origin might be one of the most important formation channel of
supermassive black holes. We use the non-detection of lensing effect of very
long baseline interferometer observations of compact radio sources with
extremely high angular resolution as a promising probe to constrain the
abundance of intergalactic PBHs in the mass range $\sim10^4$-$10^9~M_{\odot}$.
For a sample of well-measured 543 flat-spectrum compact radio sources, no
milli-lensed images are found with angular separations between $1.5$
milli-arcseconds and $50$ milli-arcseconds. From this null search result, we
derive that the fraction of dark matter made up of supermassive PBHs in the

increase of the number of measured compact radio sources. For instance, on the

Approximating $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}$ using inexpensive but biased surrogates

a graph convolutional network (GCN) encoder and a stochastic decoder, which are
layer-wise connected by a hierarchical variational auto-encoder architecture.
By specifically modeling the degree heterogeneity using node random factors,
our model possesses better interpretability in both community structure and
degree heterogeneity. For fast inference, the stochastic gradient variational
Bayes (SGVB) is adopted using a non-iterative recognition model, which is much
more scalable than traditional MCMC-based methods. The experiments on

tomography. We detail the experimental requirements, construct the necessary
post-processing algorithms for maximum-likelihood estimation, outline the
best-practice aspects for accurate results, and make the procedure efficient
for low-memory processes. The characterisation is a pathway to diagnostics and
informed control of correlated noise. As an example application of the
hardware-agnostic technique, we show how its predictive control can be used to
substantially improve multi-time circuit fidelities on superconducting quantum
devices. Our methods could form the core for carefully developed software that
may help hardware consistently pass the fault-tolerant noise threshold.

image when a correlated image is available as side information only at the
decoder. This problem is known as distributed source coding (DSC) in
information theory. In particular, we consider a pair of stereo images, which
generally have high correlation with each other due to overlapping fields of
view, and assume that one image of the pair is to be compressed and
transmitted, while the other image is available only at the decoder. In the
proposed architecture, the encoder maps the input image to a latent space,
quantizes the latent representation, and compresses it using entropy coding.
The decoder is trained to extract the common information between the input
image and the correlated image, using only the latter. The received latent
representation and the locally generated common information are passed through
a decoder network to obtain an enhanced reconstruction of the input image. The
common information provides a succinct representation of the relevant
information at the receiver. We train and demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach on the KITTI and Cityscape datasets of stereo image pairs.
Our results show that the proposed architecture is capable of exploiting the
decoder-only side information, and outperforms previous work on stereo image
compression with decoder side information.

electromagnetic effect, and the chemical effect due to altered molecular
properties of the sample in close proximity to the plasmonic tip. Significant
theoretical effort is put into the modelling of the electromagnetic

computational protocol that allows for investigation of the local chemical
effect -- including non-resonant, resonant and charge transfer contributions --
in a plasmonic hybrid system by mapping the sample molecule with a metallic tip
model at the (time-dependent) density functional level of theory. In the
present contribution, we evaluate the impact of static charges localized on the
tip's frontmost atom, possibly induced by the tip geometry in the vicinity of
the apex, on the TERS signal and the lateral resolution. To this aim, an
immobilized molecule, i.e. tin(II) phthalocyanine (SnPc), is mapped by the
plasmonic tip modeled by a single positively vs. negatively charged silver
atom. The performed quantum chemical simulations reveal a pronounced
enhancement of the Raman intensity under non-resonant and resonant conditions

highly dependent on the tip's charge.

in this work we present the first real-time method for motion capture of
skeletal pose and 3D surface geometry of hands from a single RGB camera that
explicitly considers close interactions. In order to address the inherent depth
ambiguities in RGB data, we propose a novel multi-task CNN that regresses
multiple complementary pieces of information, including segmentation, dense
matchings to a 3D hand model, and 2D keypoint positions, together with newly
proposed intra-hand relative depth and inter-hand distance maps. These
predictions are subsequently used in a generative model fitting framework in
order to estimate pose and shape parameters of a 3D hand model for both hands.
We experimentally verify the individual components of our RGB two-hand tracking

we demonstrate that our approach offers previously unseen two-hand tracking
performance from RGB, and quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms existing
RGB-based methods that were not explicitly designed for two-hand interactions.
Moreover, our method even performs on-par with depth-based real-time methods.

is a fast-growing area of machine learning with far-reaching societal impact.
However, existing fair learning methods are vulnerable to accidental or
malicious artifacts in the training data, which can cause them to unknowingly
produce unfair classifiers. In this work we address the problem of fair
learning from unreliable training data in the robust multisource setting, where
the available training data comes from multiple sources, a fraction of which
might not be representative of the true data distribution. We introduce FLEA, a
filtering-based algorithm that identifies and suppresses those data sources
that would have a negative impact on fairness or accuracy if they were used for
training. As such, FLEA is not a replacement of prior fairness-aware learning
methods but rather an augmentation that makes any of them robust against
unreliable training data. We show the effectiveness of our approach by a
diverse range of experiments on multiple datasets. Additionally, we prove
formally that -- given enough data -- FLEA protects the learner against
corruptions as long as the fraction of affected data sources is less than half.

have stochastic and nondeterministic behavior. Given a probabilistic system, a
probabilistic model checker takes a property and checks whether or not the
property holds in that system. For this reason, probabilistic model checking
provide rigorous guarantees. So far, however, probabilistic model checking has
focused on propositional models where a state is represented by a symbol. On
the other hand, it is commonly required to make relational abstractions in
planning and reinforcement learning. Various frameworks handle relational
domains, for instance, STRIPS planning and relational Markov Decision
Processes. Using propositional model checking in relational settings requires
one to ground the model, which leads to the well known state explosion problem
and intractability. We present pCTL-REBEL, a lifted model checking approach for
verifying pCTL properties of relational MDPs. It extends REBEL, a relational
model-based reinforcement learning technique, toward relational pCTL model
checking. PCTL-REBEL is lifted, which means that rather than grounding, the
model exploits symmetries to reason about a group of objects as a whole at the
relational level. Theoretically, we show that pCTL model checking is decidable
for relational MDPs that have a possibly infinite domain, provided that the
states have a bounded size. Practically, we contribute algorithms and an
implementation of lifted relational model checking, and we show that the lifted
approach improves the scalability of the model checking approach.

Based merely on the law of the conservation of energy, the exact criteria for a
rigid block to overturn in the free vibration regime are established for the
first time in the context of both nonlinear and linear theory. That is, if the
initial conditions of the free oscillation regime fall within the prescribed
stable libration region, then it is a priori determined that the block will not
overturn and vice versa. The analytical solution to the nonlinear free rocking
problem is also derived, utilizing integration techniques originating from the
solution of the nonlinear pendulum. Additionally, pulse-type overturning
spectra are constructed easily by numerical integration of the equation of
motion only during the pulse duration. If the block does not topple during the
forced regime, the angle and angular velocity at the end of the excitations are
employed to assess immediately the safety or unsafety of the block using the
exact overturning nonlinear criterion. Finally, new insights into the stability

Below a critical inclination angle the sleeping tops are force free. The

stationary trajectory of the sleeping top is characterized by its angle to the

stationary motion of the top becomes unstable and the top accelerates downhill.
The behavior points towards a complex law of dry friction of the contact point
between the top tip and the material of the inclined plane that depends on a

setting. To the best of our knowledge, so far no fully dynamic algorithms have
been designed specifically for the minimum weight cycle problem in general
digraphs. One can achieve $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ amortized update time by simply
invoking the fully dynamic APSP algorithm of Demetrescu and Italiano [J.
ACM'04]. This bound, however, yields no improvement over the trivial
recompute-from-scratch algorithm for sparse graphs.
  Our first contribution is a very simple deterministic
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate algorithm supporting vertex updates (i.e., changing
all edges incident to a specified vertex) in conditionally near-optimal
$\tilde{O}(m\log{(W)}/\epsilon)$ amortized time for digraphs with real edge
weights in $[1,W]$. Using known techniques, the algorithm can be implemented on
planar graphs and also gives some new sublinear fully dynamic algorithms
maintaining approximate cuts and flows in planar digraphs.
  Additionally, we show a Monte Carlo randomized exact fully dynamic minimum
weight cycle algorithm with $\tilde{O}(mn^{2/3})$ worst-case update that works
for real edge weights. To this end, we generalize the exact fully dynamic APSP
data structure of Abraham et al. [SODA'17] to solve the ``multiple-pairs
shortest paths problem'', where one is interested in computing distances for
some $k$ (instead of all $n^2$) fixed source-target pairs after each update. We
show that in such a scenario, $\tilde{O}((m+k)n^{2/3})$ worst-case update time
is possible.

The model takes into account the hesitancy and refusal of vaccination. To this
aim, we employ the information index, which mimics the idea that individuals
take their decision on vaccination based not only on the present but also on
the past information about the spread of the disease. Theoretical analysis and
simulations show clearly as a voluntary vaccination can certainly reduce the
impact of the disease but it is unable to eliminate it. We also show how the
information-related parameters affect the dynamics of the disease. In
particular, the hesitancy and refusal of vaccination is better contained in
case of large information coverage and small memory characteristic time.
Finally, the possible influence of seasonality is also investigated.

comprehensively probed using their quantum statistical properties. If the
neutrino is a Majorana fermion, then by definition it is identical and
indistinguishable from the corresponding antineutrino. When a Majorana neutrino
and antineutrino are pair produced, the corresponding state has to obey the
Pauli principle unlike in the Dirac case. We use this property to distinguish
between the two cases using the process $B^0 \to
\mu^-\,\mu^+\,\nu_\mu\,\bar{\nu}_\mu$. We show that the two cases differ
dramatically in a special kinematic scenario where, in the rest frame of the
parent $B$ meson, the muons fly away back-to-back (i.e. fly with 3-momenta of
equal magnitudes but opposite directions), and so do the neutrino and
antineutrino. Unlike any other scenario, we know the energies and magnitudes of
$3$-momenta of both the neutrino and the antineutrino in this back-to-back
configuration without even directly measuring them. This provides a way of
avoiding the constraint imposed by the `practical Dirac-Majorana confusion
theorem', as one need not fully integrate over neutrino and antineutrino in
this case. As a true signature of the universal principle of quantum statistics
which does not depend on the size of the mass of the particle but its spin, the
difference between Dirac and Majorana cases in this special kinematic
configuration does survive independent of the neutrino mass as long as neutrino
mass is nonzero. The analysis presented here is applicable immediately to
several other processes with the same final state as in the case of $B^0$ decay
without any major change.

propose a collaborative learning framework in the complex domain for monaural
noise suppression. The proposed system consists of two principal modules,
namely spectral feature extraction module (FEM) and stacked glance-gaze modules
(GGMs). In FEM, the UNet-block is introduced after each convolution layer,
enabling the feature recalibration from multiple scales. In each GGM, we
decompose the multi-target optimization in the complex spectrum into two
sub-tasks. Specifically, the glance path aims to suppress the noise in the
magnitude domain to obtain a coarse estimation, and meanwhile, the gaze path
attempts to compensate for the lost spectral detail in the complex domain. The
two paths work collaboratively and facilitate spectral estimation from
complementary perspectives. Besides, by repeatedly unfolding the GGMs, the
intermediate result can be iteratively refined across stages and lead to the
ultimate estimation of the spectrum. The experiments are conducted on the
WSJ0-SI84, DNS-Challenge dataset, and Voicebank+Demand dataset. Results show
that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance over previous
advanced systems on the WSJ0-SI84 and DNS-Challenge dataset, and meanwhile,
competitive performance is achieved on the Voicebank+Demand corpus.

identification methods, some key parameters, such as speed and time thresholds,

critical role in model development and calibration. In many applications, there
are multiple uncertain parameters in a model that must be estimated. However,
high dimensionality of the parameters and computational complexity of the PDE
solves make such problems challenging. A common approach is to reduce the
dimension by fixing some parameters (which we will call auxiliary parameters)
to a best estimate and use techniques from PDE-constrained optimization to
estimate the other parameters. In this article, hyper-differential sensitivity
analysis (HDSA) is used to assess the sensitivity of the solution of the
PDE-constrained optimization problem to changes in the auxiliary parameters.
Foundational assumptions for HDSA require satisfaction of the optimality
conditions which are not always practically feasible as a result of
ill-posedness in the inverse problem. We introduce novel theoretical and
computational approaches to justify and enable HDSA for ill-posed inverse
problems by projecting the sensitivities on likelihood informed subspaces and
defining a posteriori updates. Our proposed framework is demonstrated on a
nonlinear multi-physics inverse problem motivated by estimation of spatially
heterogenous material properties in the presence of spatially distributed

clients of the same interest train a global model cooperatively while keeping
their local data private. The success of a cross-silo FL process requires
active participation of many clients. Clients in cross-silo FL aim to optimize
their long-term benefits by selfishly choosing their participation levels.
While there has been some work on incentivizing clients to join FL, the
analysis of clients' long-term selfish participation behaviors in cross-silo FL
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we analyze the selfish participation
behaviors of heterogeneous clients in cross-silo FL. Specifically, we model
clients' long-term selfish participation behaviors as an infinitely repeated
game. For the stage game SPFL, we derive the unique Nash equilibrium (NE), and
propose a distributed algorithm for each client to calculate its equilibrium
participation strategy. We show that at the NE, clients fall into at most three
categories: (i) free riders, (ii) a unique partial contributor (if exists), and
(iii) contributors. For the long-term interactions among clients, we derive a
cooperative strategy for clients which minimizes the number of free riders
while increasing the amount of local data for model training. We show that
enforced by a punishment strategy, such a cooperative strategy is a subgame
perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE) of the infinitely repeated game, under which
some clients who are free riders at the NE of the stage game choose to be
(partial) contributors. We further propose an algorithm to calculate the
optimal SPNE which minimizes the number of free riders while maximizing the
amount of local data for model training. Simulation results show that our
derived optimal SPNE can effectively reduce the number of free riders by up to
99.3% and increase the amount of local data for model training by up to 82.3%.

a solid foundation for the study of concurrent languages, by researching the
connection between linear logic and the $\pi$-calculus.
  To date, Proofs as Processes is still a partial success. Caires and Pfenning
[2010] showed that linear propositions correspond to session types, which
prescribe the observable behaviour of processes. Further, Carbone et al. [2018]
demonstrated that adopting devices from hypersequents [Avron 1991] shapes
proofs such that they correspond to the expected syntactic structure of
processes in the $\pi$-calculus. What remains is reconstructing the expected
metatheory of session types and the $\pi$-calculus. In particular, the hallmark
of session types, session fidelity, still has to be reconstructed: a
correspondence between the observable behaviours of processes and their session
types, in terms of labelled transitions.
  In this article, we present $\pi$LL, a new process calculus rooted in linear
logic. The key novelty of $\pi$LL is that it comes with a carefully formulated
design recipe, based on a dialgebraic view of labelled transition systems.
Thanks to our recipe, $\pi$LL offers the expected transition systems of session
types, which we use to establish session fidelity. We use $\pi$LL to carry out
the first thorough investigation of the metatheoretical properties enforced by
linear logic on the observable behaviour of processes, uncovering connections
with similarity and bisimilarity. We also prove that $\pi$LL and our recipe
form a robust basis for the further exploration of Proofs as Processes, by
considering different features: polymorphism, process mobility, and recursion.

experimental measurement within a few tenths of kcal, justifying the
reliability of the FN DMC method for predicting barrier height of the rapid
unimolecular reaction of Criegee intermediates. By comparing the predictions
from the CCSD(t), G3 (MCG3), DFT and MP2 methods with respect to the FN DMC
results and available experiment measurement, we found that the CCSD(t) barrier
heights agree with the FN DMC counterpart within statistical errors, and is
within a closer agreement with experiment and FN DMC prediction than the
G3(MCG3) models. Barrier heights predicted from the relatively more economic
DFT methods are within a few tenths kcal of the FN DMC prediction. MP2 method
severely underestimates the barrier height. FN DMC prediction for the reaction
energy is -17.25+/-0.31 kcal/mol, setting an upper limit for the reaction
energies predicted by the post Hartree-Fock methods and a lower limit for the
DFT reaction energies. We provide FN DMC input for clarifying the energetic
uncertainties in the critical H-transfer reaction of syn-CH3CHOO. The
quantitatively close agreements between the FN DMC barrier height and
experimental measurement, and between the predictions from the FN DMC and G3
model for the reaction energy provide a theoretical basis for resolving the
energy uncertainty in this reaction.

constitute other major challenges for classifying data streams. In this paper,
we proposed a clustering-based data stream classification framework to handle
non-stationary data streams without utilizing an initial label set. A
density-based stream clustering procedure is used to capture novel concepts
with a dynamic threshold and an effective active label querying strategy is
introduced to continuously learn the new concepts from the data streams. The
sub-cluster structure of each cluster is explored to handle the overlap among
classes. Experimental results and quantitative comparison studies reveal that
the proposed method provides statistically better or comparable performance

particle-mediated nucleation pathway is actually imprinted in the resultant
single micron-sized CaSO4 crystals. This property of CaSO4 minerals provides us
with an unique opportunity to search for evidence of non-classical nucleation
pathways in geological environments. In particular, we focused on the
quintessential single crystals of anhydrite extracted from the Naica mine in
Mexico. We elucidated the growth history from this mineral sample by mapping
growth defects at different length scales. Based on these data we argue that
the nano-scale misalignment of the structural sub-units observed in the initial
calcium sulfate crystal seed propagate through different length-scales both in
morphological, as well as strictly crystallographic aspects, eventually causing
the formation of large mesostructured single crystals of anhydrite. Hence, the
nanoparticle mediated nucleation mechanism introduces a 'seed of imperfection',
which leads to a macroscopic single crystal, in which its fragments do not fit
together at different length-scales in a self-similar manner. Consequently,
anisotropic voids of various sizes are formed with very well-defined
walls/edges. But, at the same time the material retains its essential single
crystal nature. These findings shed new light on the longstanding concept of
crystal structure.

with the arrival of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).} {We combined the
GALACTICNUCLEUS NIR survey with the IRAC/Spitzer MIR survey of the GC. We
applied the so-called Rayleigh-Jeans colour excess (RJCE) de-reddening method
to our combined NIR-MIR data to identify potential hot stars in
colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs).} {Despite the very low angular resolution of
IRAC we find 12 clear candidates for young massive stars among the $1\,065$
sources that meet our selection criteria. Seven out of these 12 stars are
previously known hot, massive stars belonging to the Arches and Quintuplet
clusters, as well as sources detected by the Hubble Space Telescope/NICMOS
Paschen-$\alpha$ survey. Five of our massive star candidates have not been
previously reported in the literature.} {We show that the RJCE method is a
valuable tool to identify hot stars in the GC using photometry alone. Upcoming
instruments with high angular resolution MIR imaging capabilities such as the
JWST could surely make more substantial use of this de-reddening method and
help establish a far more complete census of hot, young stars in the GC area
than what is possible at the moment.}

society. Governments worldwide have invested lots of economic and human
resources to radically eliminate this threat. Despite these efforts, providing
accurate predictions of the risk that a victim of gender violence has of being
attacked again is still a very hard open problem. The development of new
methods for issuing accurate, fair and quick predictions would allow police
forces to select the most appropriate measures to prevent recidivism. In this
work, we propose to apply Machine Learning (ML) techniques to create models
that accurately predict the recidivism risk of a gender-violence offender. The
relevance of the contribution of this work is threefold: (i) the proposed ML
method outperforms the preexisting risk assessment algorithm based on classical
statistical techniques, (ii) the study has been conducted through an official
specific-purpose database with more than 40,000 reports of gender violence, and
(iii) two new quality measures are proposed for assessing the effective police
protection that a model supplies and the overload in the invested resources
that it generates. Additionally, we propose a hybrid model that combines the
statistical prediction methods with the ML method, permitting authorities to
implement a smooth transition from the preexisting model to the ML-based model.
This hybrid nature enables a decision-making process to optimally balance
between the efficiency of the police system and aggressiveness of the
protection measures taken.

to be Anderson-localized, with a large localization volume. Superconductivity
develops due to coherent delocalization of originally localized pre-formed
Cooper pairs. The key assumption of the theory is that each such pair is
coupled to a large number $Z\gg1$ of similar neighboring pairs. We derived
integral equations for the probability distribution $P\left(\Delta\right)$ of
local superconducting order parameter $\Delta\left(\boldsymbol{r}\right)$ and
analyzed their solutions in the limit of small dimensionless Cooper coupling
constant $\lambda\ll1$. The shape of the order-parameter distribution is found
to depend crucially upon the effective number of nearest neighbors
$Z_{\text{eff}}=2\nu_{0}\Delta_{0}Z$. The solution we provide is valid both at
large and small $Z_{\text{eff}}$; the latter case is nontrivial as the function
$P\left(\Delta\right)$ is heavily non-Gaussian. The discovery of a broad
parameter range where the distribution function $P\left(\Delta\right)$ is
non-Gaussian but also non-critical (in the sense of SIT criticality) is one of
our key findings. The analytic results are supplemented by numerical data, and
good agreement between them is observed.

this increased expressiveness, the learner is able to represent uncertainty and
a lack of knowledge in a more flexible and more faithful manner. To learn from

fall-apart decay thresholds. In addition to the two bound states that were
reported in the previous study we have found several narrow resonant states
above the $BB^*$ and $B^*B^*$ thresholds. Their structures are studied and are
interpreted by the quark dynamics. A narrow resonance with spin-parity
$J^P=1^+$ is found to be a mixed state of a compact tetraquark and a $B^*B^*$
scattering state. This is driven by a strong color Coulombic attraction between
the $bb$ quarks. Negative-parity excited resonances with $J^P=0^-$, $1^-$ and
$2^-$ form a triplet under the heavy-quark spin symmetry. It turns out that
they share a similar structure to the $\lambda$-mode of a singly heavy baryon
as a result of the strongly attractive correlation for the doubly heavy
diquark.

our choice of tooling introduce randomness to deep neural network training. We
conduct large scale experiments across different types of hardware,
accelerators, state of art networks, and open-source datasets, to characterize
how tooling choices contribute to the level of non-determinism in a system, the
impact of said non-determinism, and the cost of eliminating different sources
of noise.
  Our findings are surprising, and suggest that the impact of non-determinism
in nuanced. While top-line metrics such as top-1 accuracy are not noticeably
impacted, model performance on certain parts of the data distribution is far
more sensitive to the introduction of randomness. Our results suggest that
deterministic tooling is critical for AI safety. However, we also find that the
cost of ensuring determinism varies dramatically between neural network
architectures and hardware types, e.g., with overhead up to $746\%$, $241\%$,
and $196\%$ on a spectrum of widely used GPU accelerator architectures,

line-of-sight-velocity (LOSV) distribution in a filament, which indicates the
increasing amplitude of the small-scale motions, increased prior to the onset

which initiated approximately at 03:40UT on 2016 November 5 in the vicinity of

the surrounding magnetic fields. We found that both the spatially averaged

increased 6 and 10 hours prior to eruption, respectively. In this event, we did
not find any significant changes in the global potential-field configuration

strongly on the density of data points close to the boundary of the safe state
space to train neural network controllers with closed-loop safety guarantees,
here we propose an alternative approach that lifts such strong assumptions on
the data that are hard to satisfy in practice and instead allows for graceful
safety violations, i.e., of a bounded magnitude that can be spatially
controlled. To do so, we employ reachability analysis techniques to encapsulate
safety constraints in the training process. Specifically, to obtain a
computationally efficient over-approximation of the forward reachable set of
the closed-loop system, we partition the robot's state space into cells and
adaptively subdivide the cells that contain states which may escape the safe
set under the trained control law. Then, using the overlap between each cell's
forward reachable set and the set of infeasible robot configurations as a
measure for safety violations, we introduce appropriate terms into the loss
function that penalize this overlap in the training process. As a result, our
method can learn a safe vector field for the closed-loop system and, at the
same time, provide worst-case bounds on safety violation over the whole
configuration space, defined by the overlap between the over-approximation of
the forward reachable set of the closed-loop system and the set of unsafe
states. Moreover, it can control the tradeoff between computational complexity
and tightness of these bounds. Our proposed method is supported by both
theoretical results and simulation studies.

challenging when computing the dose with computationally expensive but accurate

(re-)weighting method in MC history scoring to concurrently construct estimates
for error scenarios, the expected dose and its variance from a single set of MC
simulated particle histories. The approach relies on a multivariate Gaussian
input and uncertainty model, which assigns probabilities to the initial phase
space sample, enabling the use of different correlation models. Exploring and
adapting bivariate emittance parametrizations for the beam shape, accuracy can
be traded between that of the uncertainty or the nominal dose estimate. The
method was implemented using the MC code TOPAS and tested for proton IMPT plan
delivery in comparison to a reference scenario estimate. We achieve accurate
results for set-up uncertainties ($\gamma_{3mm/3\%} \geq 99.99\%$) and
expectedly lower but still sufficient agreement for range uncertainties, which
are approximated with uncertainty over the energy distribution ($\gamma_{3

quasiconvexity in the planar case. For some specific families of energies,
there are precise conditions known under which rank-one convexity even implies
polyconvexity. We will extend some of these findings to the more general family
of energies $W:\operatorname{GL}^+(n)\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ with an additive
volumetric-isochoric split, i.e. \[
  W(F)=W_{\rm iso}(F)+W_{\rm vol}(\det F)=\widetilde W_{\rm
iso}\bigg(\frac{F}{\sqrt{\det F}}\bigg)+W_{\rm vol}(\det F)\,, \] which is the
natural finite extension of isotropic linear elasticity. Our approach is based
on a condition for rank-one convexity which was recently derived from the
classical two-dimensional criterion by Knowles and Sternberg and consists of a
family of one-dimensional coupled differential inequalities. We identify a
number of \enquote{least} rank-one convex energies and, in particular, show
that for planar volumetric-isochorically split energies with a concave
volumetric part, the question of whether rank-one convexity implies
quasiconvexity can be reduced to the open question of whether the rank-one
convex energy function \[
  W_{\rm magic}^+(F)=\frac{\lambda_{\rm max}}{\lambda_{\rm
min}}-\log\frac{\lambda_{\rm max}}{\lambda_{\rm min}}+\log\det
F=\frac{\lambda_{\rm max}}{\lambda_{\rm min}}-2\log\lambda_{\rm min} \] is
quasiconvex. In addition, we demonstrate that under affine boundary conditions,
$W_{\rm magic}^+(F)$ allows for non-trivial inhomogeneous deformations with the
same energy level as the homogeneous solution, and show a surprising connection
to the work of Burkholder and Iwaniec in the field of complex analysis.

determinations from the number counts, sky brightness or redshift dipoles

peculiar velocities two to ten times larger than CMBR, though in all cases the
directions matched with the CMBR dipole. Here we introduce a novel technique
for determining the peculiar motion from the magnitude-redshift ($m_{\rm B}-z$)
Hubble diagram of Type Ia Supernovae (SN Ia), one of the best standard candles

preferred direction in the universe, implying an intrinsic anisotropy, in

parameter used by Berry and Gair ($\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle \Sigma}$) that
parametrizes the bending of light and the Shapiro time delay in situations in
which the standard $\gamma$ cannot be promptly used. First we apply our
considerations to two well known cases, but for which some conflicting results
can be found: massive Brans-Dicke gravity and $f(R)$ gravity (both the metric
and the Palatini versions). Although the slip parameter is always well defined,
it has in general no direct relation to either light deflection or the Shapiro
time delay, hence care should be taken on imposing the PPN $\gamma$ bounds on
the slip. We stress that, for any system with a well posed Newtonian limit,
Palatini $f(R)$ theories always have $\gamma = 1$; while metric $f(R)$ theories
can only have two values: either 1 or 1/2. The extension towards Horndeski
gravity shows no qualitative surprises, and $\gamma_{\scriptscriptstyle
\Sigma}$ is a constant in this context (only assuming that the Horndeski
potentials can be approximated by analytical functions). This implies that a
precise study on the bending of light for different impact parameters can in
principle be used to rule out the complete Horndeski action as an action for
gravity. Also, we comment on the consequences for $\gamma$ inferences at

is an intriguing question, which much interested researchers in both fields of
biology and physics for centuries. There several putative proposals that sound
intuitively plausible all remain contested so far because those
hypothesis-models of magnetoreceptor to sense geomagnetic field need either
extremely high sensitivity or humankind-like intelligence to guide. Here we
explore theoretically that the birds can navigate to their destination through
an entirely new scenario to sense the geomagnetic field. Our proposal is based
on separate peaks of the resonance-fluorescence spectrum of a four-level system
derived from the ferric sulfide cluster which exists in a protein complex
(Drosophila CG8198) of migratory birds. As the separation of spectral peaks
contains information about geomagnetic field at both current location and
birthland, the change of such separation cues the bird to choose a right
direction to move and double-resonance emerges once arrived the destination.
Our theoretical mechanism can explain previous experiments on the
disorientation of migratory birds caused by oscillating magnetic field
naturally and more precisely. This work provides insight to explain migratory
navigation and motivates possible manmade practical devices.

the identification of dynamical regimes is formulated as an optimization
problem, and we propose an intelligible objective function. Furthermore, we
propose an unsupervised learning framework which eliminates the need for a

appropriate clustering and dimensionality reduction algorithms, and this choice
can be guided using our proposed objective function. We illustrate its
applicability with example problems drawn from ocean dynamics, tumor

improving the degree of freedom (DoF) of multi-input and multi-output (MIMO)
systems. However, most of the traditional IA schemes suffer from the high
computational complexity and require the global and instantaneous channel state
information (CSI), both of which make them difficult to be extended to cellular
MIMO systems. To handle these issues, two new interference alignment schemes,
i.e., the retrospective interference regeneration (RIR) scheme and the
beamforming based distributed retrospective interference alignment (B-DRIA)
scheme, are proposed for cellular K-user MIMO downlink networks. For the RIR
scheme, it adopts interference elimination algorithm to erase redundant symbols
in inter-cell interference (ICI) signals, and then uses interference
regeneration algorithm to avoid secondary interference. The RIR scheme obtains
greater DoF gain than the retrospective interference alignment (RIA) scheme,
but incurs performance degradation when the transceiver antennas ratio (TAR)
approaches 1. Therefore, the B-DRIA scheme is further proposed. For the B-DRIA
scheme, the cellular beamforming matrix is introduced to eliminate the ICI, and
meanwhile distributed retrospective interference alignment algorithm is adopted
to align inter-user interference (IUI). The simulation results show that the
B-DRIA scheme obtains larger DoF than the RIR scheme locally. Specifically,
when TAR approaches 1, two schemes obtain the same DoF. While TAR approaches 2,
the DoF of the B-DRIA scheme is superior than the RIR scheme.

adaptive, scale-based signal analysis in various fields like robotics, security
and biomedical engineering. Since the dramatic increase in amount of data puts
forward higher requirements for the capability of real-time signal analysis, it
is difficult for existing EMD and its variants to trade off the growth of data
dimension and the speed of signal analysis. In order to decompose
multi-dimensional signals at a faster speed, we present a novel
signal-serialization method (serial-EMD), which concatenates multi-variate or
multi-dimensional signals into a one-dimensional signal and uses various
one-dimensional EMD algorithms to decompose it. To verify the effects of the
proposed method, synthetic multi-variate time series, artificial 2D images with
various textures and real-world facial images are tested. Compared with
existing multi-EMD algorithms, the decomposition time becomes significantly
reduced. In addition, the results of facial recognition with Intrinsic Mode
Functions (IMFs) extracted using our method can achieve a higher accuracy than
those obtained by existing multi-EMD algorithms, which demonstrates the
superior performance of our method in terms of the quality of IMFs.
Furthermore, this method can provide a new perspective to optimize the existing
EMD algorithms, that is, transforming the structure of the input signal rather
than being constrained by developing envelope computation techniques or signal
decomposition methods. In summary, the study suggests that the serial-EMD
technique is a highly competitive and fast alternative for multi-dimensional
signal analysis.

for the understanding and control of the epidemic. In this work, we consider
three kinds of typical behavioral changes in epidemic process that is,
self-quarantine of infected individuals, self-protection of susceptible
individuals, and social distancing between them. We connect the behavioral
changes with individual's social attributes by the activity-driven network with
attractiveness. A mean-field theory is established to derive an analytical
estimate of epidemic threshold for SIS models with individual behavioral
changes, which depends on the correlations between activity, attractiveness and
the number of generative links in the susceptible and infected states. We find
that individual behaviors play different roles in suppressing the epidemic.
Although all the behavioral changes could delay the epidemic by increasing the
epidemic threshold, self-quarantine and social distancing of infected
individuals could effectively decrease the epidemic size. In addition,
simultaneous changes in these behaviors and the timing of implement of them
also play a key role in suppressing the epidemic. These results provide helpful
