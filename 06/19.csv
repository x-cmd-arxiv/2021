graphs in geometric space. Those representations are considered useful in
downstream tasks such as link prediction and clustering. However, the number of
graph embedding methods available on the market is large, and practitioners
face the non-trivial choice of selecting the proper approach for a given
application. The present work attempts to close this gap of knowledge through a
systematic comparison of eleven different methods for graph embedding. We
consider methods for embedding networks in the hyperbolic and Euclidean metric
spaces, as well as non-metric community-based embedding methods. We apply these
methods to embed more than one hundred real-world and synthetic networks. Three
common downstream tasks -- mapping accuracy, greedy routing, and link
prediction -- are considered to evaluate the quality of the various embedding
methods. Our results show that some Euclidean embedding methods excel in greedy
routing. As for link prediction, community-based and hyperbolic embedding
methods yield overall performance superior than that of Euclidean-space-based
approaches. We compare the running time for different methods and further
analyze the impact of different network characteristics such as degree
distribution, modularity, and clustering coefficients on the quality of the
different embedding methods. We release our evaluation framework to provide a
standardized benchmark for arbitrary embedding methods.

Knowing the gray matter brain structures' different behaviors, the parameters
were fine-tuned to obtain a generalized human brain model. The brain

The simulator's numerical model uses a novel approach with respect to the

learning in spatio-temporal modelling problems such as those in climate science

support large numbers of off-the-grid spatial data-points and long time-series
which is a hallmark of many applications.
  Pseudo-point approximations, one of the gold-standard methods for scaling GPs
to large data sets, are well suited for handling off-the-grid spatial data.
However, they cannot handle long temporal observation horizons effectively
reverting to cubic computational scaling in the time dimension. State space GP
approximations are well suited to handling temporal data, if the temporal GP
prior admits a Markov form, leading to linear complexity in the number of
temporal observations, but have a cubic spatial cost and cannot handle
off-the-grid spatial data.
  In this work we show that there is a simple and elegant way to combine
pseudo-point methods with the state space GP approximation framework to get the
best of both worlds. The approach hinges on a surprising conditional
independence property which applies to space--time separable GPs. We
demonstrate empirically that the combined approach is more scalable and

reveal that integrated information can effectively capture surprisingly

their fragility to adversarial attacks. This sensitivity to making erroneous

networks difficult to adopt for certain real-world, mission-critical
applications. While much of the research focus has revolved around adversarial
example creation and adversarial hardening, the area of performance measures

this study presents the concept of residual error, a new performance measure
for not only assessing the adversarial robustness of a deep neural network at
the individual sample level, but also can be used to differentiate between
adversarial and non-adversarial examples to facilitate for adversarial example
detection. Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid model for approximating the
residual error in a tractable manner. Experimental results using the case of
image classification demonstrates the effectiveness and efficacy of the
proposed residual error metric for assessing several well-known deep neural
network architectures. These results thus illustrate that the proposed measure
could be a useful tool for not only assessing the robustness of deep neural
networks used in mission-critical scenarios, but also in the design of

have access to domain-specific knowledge about the place, which can provide
semantic contextual information allowing better reasoning and decision making.
In this paper we propose a system that allows a mobile robot to operate in a
location-aware and operator-friendly way, by leveraging semantic information
from the deployment location and integrating it to the robots localization and
navigation systems. We integrate Building Information Models (BIM) into the
Robotic Operating System (ROS), to generate topological and metric maps fed to
an layered path planner (global and local). A map merging algorithm integrates
newly discovered obstacles into the metric map, while a UWB-based localization
system detects equipment to be registered back into the semantic database. The
results are validated in simulation and real-life deployments in buildings and
construction sites.

measurement accuracy and reliability. In this study, we demonstrate
subnanometer traceability of localization microscopy, establishing a
metrological foundation for the maturation and application of super-resolution
methods. To do so, we create a master standard by measuring the positions of
submicrometer apertures in an array by traceable atomic-force microscopy. We
perform correlative measurements of this master standard by optical microscopy,
calibrating scale factor and correcting aberration effects. We introduce the
concept of a localization uncertainty field due to optical localization errors
and scale factor uncertainty, with regions of position traceability to within a
68 % coverage interval of +/- 1 nm. These results enable localization metrology
with high throughput, which we apply to measure working standards that we
fabricate by electron-beam lithography, validating the accuracy of mean pitch
and closing the loop for disseminating and integrating reference arrays. We
then apply our novel methods to calibrate an optical microscope with a sample
cryostat, accounting for thermal contraction by use of a submicrometer pillar
array in silicon as a reference material and elucidating complex distortion.
This new calibration enables the accurate integration of quantum emitters and
photonic structures with high yield, as we demonstrate theoretically through
simulations of the dependence of the Purcell factor of radiative enhancement on
registration errors across a wide field. Our study illuminates the challenges
and opportunities of achieving traceable localization for comparison of
position data across lithography and microscopy systems, from ambient to

oscillatory. Such rheotaxis stems from the interplay between the motion and
complex shapes of the microswimmers, e.g. the chirality of the rotating
flagella, the shear flow characteristics, and the hydrodynamic interaction with
a confining surface. Here, we show that an isotropic, active droplet
microswimmer exhibits a unique oscillatory rheotaxis in a microchannel despite
its simple spherical geometry. The swimming velocity, orientation, and the
chemical wake of the active droplet undergo periodic variations between the
confining walls during the oscillatory navigation. Using a hydrodynamic model
and concepts of dynamical systems, we demonstrate that the oscillatory
rheotaxis of the active droplet emerges primarily from the interplay between
the hydrodynamic interaction of the finite-sized microswimmer with all the
microchannel walls, and the shear flow characteristics. Such oscillatory
rheotactic behavior is different from the directed motion near a planar wall
observed previously for artificial microswimmers in shear flows. Our results
provide a realistic understanding of the behaviour of active particles in
confined microflows, as will be encountered in majority of the applications

require large complete active spaces (CAS). The success of iCISCF stems from
three ingredients: (1) efficient selection of individual configuration state
functions spanning the CAS, meanwhile maintaining full spin symmetry; (2) the
use of Jacobi rotation for the optimization of active orbitals, in conjunction
with a quasi-Newton algorithm for the core/active-virtual and core-active
orbital rotations; (3) a second-order perturbative treatment of the residual
space left over by the selection procedure (i.e., iCISCF(2)). Just like
selected iCI being a very accurate approximation to CASCI, iCISCF(2) is a very
accurate approximation to CASSCF. Several examples that go beyond the
capability of CASSCF are taken as showcases to reveal the performances of
iCISCF and iCISCF(2).

So far there is no
natural explanation why the dark matter should exist and even dominate the
universe. In this paper, we begin with a 3+1D topological gravity theory which
is super renormalizable with vanishing beta functions, then we argue that
Einstein gravity can emerge by condensing loop-like excitation from the
underlying topological gravity theory. In the meanwhile, the uncondensed
loop-like excitations serves as a natural candidate of dark matter and a
generalized Einstein equation can be derived in the presence of
loop-source(dark matter) background. Surprisingly, we find that such kind of
dark matter will not contribute to scalar curvature, however, it will become a
source of torsion. Finally, we derive the generalized Einstein equation in the
presence of Dirac field. Very different from the usual Einstein-Carton theory,
our theory further predicts that any type of normal matter, including Dirac
field will not produce torsion. All these unique predictions can be tested by
future experiments. Our framework suggests that topological invariant principle
might play a more profound role than the well-known general covariance
principle, especially towards understanding the nature of dark matter and
quantum gravity in 3+1D.

Several off-policy evaluation (OPE) techniques have been proposed to assess the
value of policies using only logged data. However, there is still a big gap
between the evaluation by OPE and the full online evaluation. Yet, large
amounts of online interactions are often not possible in practice. To overcome
this problem, we introduce active offline policy selection - a novel sequential
decision approach that combines logged data with online interaction to identify
the best policy. We use OPE estimates to warm start the online evaluation.
Then, in order to utilize the limited environment interactions wisely we decide
which policy to evaluate next based on a Bayesian optimization method with a
kernel that represents policy similarity. We use multiple benchmarks, including
real-world robotics, with a large number of candidate policies to show that the
proposed approach improves upon state-of-the-art OPE estimates and pure online

the simplest case, concept learning, this is a disjunctive normal form (DNF)

cosmological recombination, and ultimately cosmic microwave background (CMB)
anisotropies. Moreover, if energy injection is inhomogeneous, it may induce a
spatially-varying ionization fraction, and non-Gaussianity in the CMB. The
observability of these signals, however, is contingent upon how far the
injected particles propagate and deposit their energy into the primordial
plasma, relative to the characteristic scale of energy injection fluctuations.
In this study we inspect the spatial properties of energy deposition and
perturbed recombination resulting from an inhomogeneous energy injection of
sub-10 MeV photons, relevant to accreting primordial black holes (PBHs). We
develop a novel Monte-Carlo radiation transport code accounting for all
relevant photon interactions in this energy range, and including secondary
electron energy deposition efficiency through a new analytic approximation. For
a specified injected photon spectrum, the code outputs an
injection-to-deposition Green's function depending on time and distance from
the injection point. Combining this output with a linearized solution of the
perturbed recombination problem, we derive time- and scale-dependent
deposition-to-ionization Green's functions. We apply this general framework to
accreting PBHs, whose luminosity is strongly spatially modulated by supersonic
relative velocities between cold dark matter and baryons. We find that the
resulting spatial fluctuations of the free-electron fraction are of the same
magnitude as its mean deviation from standard recombination, from which current
CMB power spectra constraints are derived. This work suggests that the
sensitivity to accreting PBHs might be substantially improved by propagating
these inhomogeneities to CMB anisotropy power spectra and non-Gaussian
statistics, which we study in subsequent papers.

adapt Transformer to TAD, we propose three improvements to enhance its locality

attends to a sparse set of key snippets in a video. A segment refinement

the sky in near infrared (NIR) bands using Teledyne H4RG HgCdTe photodiode

trapped in the photodiodes during earlier exposures are gradually released into
later exposures, leading to contamination of the images and potentially to
errors in measured galaxy properties such as fluxes and shapes. In this work,
we use image simulations that incorporate the persistence effect to study its
impact on galaxy shape measurements and weak lensing signals. No significant
spatial correlations are found between the galaxy shape changes induced by
persistence. On the scales of interest for weak lensing cosmology, the effect
of persistence on the weak lensing correlation function is about two orders of

functions (NPCFs) of random fields in arbitrary $D$-dimensional homogeneous and
isotropic spaces. Such statistics appear throughout the physical sciences, and
provide a natural tool to describe stochastic processes. algorithms for
computing the NPCF components have $\mathcal{O}(n^N)$ complexity (for a data
set containing $n$ particles); their application is thus computationally
infeasible unless $N$ is small. By projecting the statistic onto a
suitably-defined angular basis, we show that the estimators can be written in a
separable form, with complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$, or $\mathcal{O}(n_{\rm
g}\log n_{\rm g})$ if evaluated using a Fast Fourier Transform on a grid of
size $n_{\rm g}$. Our decomposition is built upon the $D$-dimensional
hyperspherical harmonics; these form a complete basis on the $(D-1)$-sphere and
are intrinsically related to angular momentum operators. Concatenation of
$(N-1)$ such harmonics gives states of definite combined angular momentum,
forming a natural separable basis for the NPCF. As $N$ and $D$ grow, the number
of basis components quickly becomes large, providing a practical limitation to
this (and all other) approaches: however, the dimensionality is greatly reduced
in the presence of symmetries; for example, isotropic correlation functions
require only states of zero combined angular momentum. We provide a
\textsc{Julia} package implementing our estimators, and show how they can be
applied to a variety of scenarios within cosmology and fluid dynamics. The
efficiency of such estimators will allow higher-order correlators to become a
standard tool in the analysis of random fields.

galaxy yields a size of ~3 sq.kpc, a luminosity Muv=-20.3,and a stellar mass
M~10^9 Msun;16% of the ultraviolet light is located in a 3 Myr old
gravitationally-bound young massive star cluster (YMC) with an effective radius
of Re~8 pc and a dynamical mass of ~10^7 Msun (similar to the stellar mass),
from which LyC radiation is detected (\lambda < 912A). The inferred outflowing
gas velocity (>300 km/s) exceeds the escape velocity of the star cluster. The
resulting escape fraction of the ionizing radiation emerging from the Sunburst
galaxy is >6-12%, whilst it is >46-93% if inferred from the YMC. 12 additional
likely star clusters with 3<Re<20 pc are identified in the galaxy from which we
derive a cluster formation efficiency \Gamma>~30%, which is consistent with the
high \Gamma derived in local galaxies experiencing extreme gas physical
conditions. The presence of the YMC influences the morphology (nucleation),
photometry (photometric jumps) and spectroscopic output (nebular emission) of
the entire galaxy. The de-lensed LyC and UV (1600A) magnitudes of the YMC are
~30.6 and ~26.9, whilst the galaxy has m1600~24.8. A relatively large
rest-frame equivalent width of EWrest(Hb+[OIII]4959-5007)~450A emerges from the

star clusters, then such engines were the key ionizing agents during

of 80 arcsec. This radial distance triples previous spatial explorations of the
stellar distribution of this galaxy. In addition, the distribution of its
globular clusters (GCs) is not extended in relation to the bulk of the galaxy
(the radius containing half of the GCs is 21 arcsec). We also found that the

the dynamics of the plasma column with its time-varying emission features. From
our analysis, we find a correlated trend between the growth rate of kink mode

orders of magnitude higher than Jupiter's current value. We also show that the
time variation of the stellar wind and density generates a net increase in wind
ram pressure and does not allow a magnetosphere to be maintained at any time
for field strengths less than 10^{-5} T (0.1 G). This lack of protection hints
that currently potentially habitable planets orbiting white dwarfs would have
been previously inhospitable.

atmospheres of closely orbiting exoplanets, driving mass outflows that may be
significant enough to evaporate a sizable fraction of the planet atmosphere
over the system lifetime. The recent surge in the number of known exoplanets,
together with the imminent deployment of new ground and space-based facilities
for exoplanet discovery and characterization, requires a prompt and efficient
assessment of the most promising targets for intensive spectroscopic
follow-ups. To this purpose, we developed ATES (ATmospheric EScape); a new
hydrodynamics code that is specifically designed to compute the temperature,
density, velocity and ionization fraction profiles of highly irradiated
planetary atmospheres, along with the current, steady-state mass loss rate.
ATES solves the one-dimensional Euler, mass and energy conservation equations
in radial coordinates through a finite-volume scheme. The hydrodynamics module
is paired with a photoionization equilibrium solver that includes cooling via
bremsstrahlung, recombination and collisional excitation/ionization for the
case of a primordial atmosphere entirely composed of atomic hydrogen and
helium, whilst also accounting for advection of the different ion species.
Compared against the results of 14 moderately-to-highly irradiated planets
simulated with The PLUTO-CLOUDY Interface (TPCI), ATES yields remarkably good
agreement at a significantly smaller fraction of the computational time. A
convergence study shows that ATES recovers stable, steady-state hydrodynamic
solutions for systems with $\log(-\phi_p) \lesssim 12.9 + 0.17\log F_{\rm
XUV}$. Incidentally, atmospheres of systems above this threshold are generally
thought to be undergoing Jeans escape. The code, which also features a
user-friendly graphic interface, is available publicly as an online repository.

that the entire distortion-perception tradeoff of a Gaussian source can be

documented events of COVID-19 superspreading on flights. We used available data
from three flights, including cabin layout and seat locations of infected and

superspreading events during air travel. Specifically, we studied: 1) London to
Hanoi with 201 passengers, including 13 secondary infections among passengers;
2) Singapore to Hangzhou with 321 passengers, including 12 to 14 secondary

passengers and no secondary infections. We show that inclusion of passenger
movement better explains the infection spread patterns than conventional models
do. We also found that FFP2/N95 mask usage would have reduced infection by
95-100%, while cloth masks would have reduced it by only 40-80%. This suggests
the need for more stringent guidelines to reduce aviation-related

decide which aspects of the environment should be modeled. The
value-equivalence (VE) principle proposes a simple answer to this question: a
model should capture the aspects of the environment that are relevant for
value-based planning. Technically, VE distinguishes models based on a set of
policies and a set of functions: a model is said to be VE to the environment if
the Bellman operators it induces for the policies yield the correct result when
applied to the functions. As the number of policies and functions increase, the
set of VE models shrinks, eventually collapsing to a single point corresponding
to a perfect model. A fundamental question underlying the VE principle is thus
how to select the smallest sets of policies and functions that are sufficient
for planning. In this paper we take an important step towards answering this
question. We start by generalizing the concept of VE to order-$k$ counterparts
defined with respect to $k$ applications of the Bellman operator. This leads to
a family of VE classes that increase in size as $k \rightarrow \infty$. In the
limit, all functions become value functions, and we have a special
instantiation of VE which we call proper VE or simply PVE. Unlike VE, the PVE
class may contain multiple models even in the limit when all value functions
are used. Crucially, all these models are sufficient for planning, meaning that
they will yield an optimal policy despite the fact that they may ignore many
aspects of the environment. We construct a loss function for learning PVE
models and argue that popular algorithms such as MuZero can be understood as
minimizing an upper bound for this loss. We leverage this connection to propose
a modification to MuZero and show that it can lead to improved performance in
practice.

growth of Ta/CoFeB/MgO structures with a large perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy (PMA) on full coverage monolayer (ML) MoS2. A large perpendicular
interface anisotropy energy of 0.975mJ/m2 has been obtained at the CoFeB/MgO
interface, comparable to that observed in magnetic tunnel junction systems. It
is found that the insertion of MgO between the ferromagnetic metal (FM) and the
2D material can effectively prevent the diffusion of the FM atoms into the 2D
material. Moreover, the MoS2 ML favors a MgO(001) texture and plays a critical
role to establish the large PMA. First principle calculations on a similar
Fe/MgO/MoS2 structure reveal that the MgO thickness can modify the MoS2 band
structure, from an indirect bandgap with 7ML-MgO to a direct bandgap with
3ML-MgO. Proximity effect induced by Fe results in a splitting of 10meV in the
valence band at the {\Gamma} point for the 3ML-MgO structure while it is
negligible for the 7ML-MgO structure. These results pave the way to develop RT

effective method to extract lots of required information from complex driving
scenes. To fill the gap, this paper develops a scene analysis system. The
Multi-Net of the system includes two multi-task neural networks that perform
scene classification to provide four labels for each scene. The DeepLab v3 and
YOLO v3 are combined by the system to detect and locate risky pedestrians and
the nearest vehicles. All identified information can provide the situational
awareness to autonomous vehicles or human drivers for identifying crash risks
from the surrounding traffic. To address the scarcity of annotated image
datasets for studying traffic crashes, two completely new datasets have been

be effective in training the proposed deep neural networks. The paper further
evaluates the performance of the Multi-Net and the efficiency of the developed

a multitude of approximation/time tradeoffs were obtained, improving upon the
folklore algorithm, which maintains a maximal (and hence $2$-approximate)
matching in $O(n)$ worst-case update time in $n$-node graphs.
  We present the first deterministic algorithm which outperforms the folklore
algorithm in terms of {\em both} approximation ratio and worst-case update
time. Specifically, we give a $(2-\Omega(1))$-approximate algorithm with
$O(m^{3/8})=O(n^{3/4})$ worst-case update time in $n$-node, $m$-edge graphs.
For sufficiently small constant $\epsilon>0$, no deterministic
$(2+\epsilon)$-approximate algorithm with worst-case update time $O(n^{0.99})$
was known. Our second result is the first deterministic
$(2+\epsilon)$-approximate weighted matching algorithm with $O_\epsilon(1)\cdot
O(\sqrt[4]{m}) = O_\epsilon(1)\cdot O(\sqrt{n})$ worst-case update time.
  Our main technical contributions are threefold: first, we characterize the
tight cases for \emph{kernels}, which are the well-studied matching sparsifiers
underlying much of the $(2+\epsilon)$-approximate dynamic matching literature.
This characterization, together with multiple ideas -- old and new -- underlies
our result for breaking the approximation barrier of $2$. Our second technical
contribution is the first example of a dynamic matching algorithm whose running
time is improved due to improving the \emph{recourse} of other dynamic matching
algorithms. Finally, we show how to use dynamic bipartite matching algorithms
as black-box subroutines for dynamic matching in general graphs without
incurring the natural $\frac{3}{2}$ factor in the approximation ratio which
such approaches naturally incur.

We formulate GSAT as a non-convex concave minimax optimization problem which

the applications of GSAT for group-sparse and rank-constrained perturbations
modeled using group and nuclear norm penalties. In order to solve GSAT's

The idea is to re-evaluate the taken security risk decisions with the aim to
provide trustable data when the security measures fail. Additionally, it also
considers possible disputes, which the digital evidence can solve. Our proposed
approach, risk-oriented forensic-ready design, composes of two parts: (1)
process guiding the identification of the requirements in the form of potential

in academic sociology, as well as among popular movements for social justice
such as Black Lives Matter, intersectional feminism, and LGBT rights.
Intersectionality proposes that an individual's experience of society has
aspects that are irreducible to the sum of one's various identities considered
individually, but are ""greater than the sum of their parts."" In this work, we
show that the effects of intersectional identities can be statistically
observed in empirical data using information theory. We show that, when
considering the predictive relationship between various identities categories
such as race, sex, and income (as a proxy for class) on outcomes such as health
and wellness, robust statistical synergies appear. These synergies show that
there are joint-effects of identities on outcomes that are irreducible to any
identity considered individually and only appear when specific categories are
considered together (for example, there is a large, synergistic effect of race
and sex considered jointly on income irreducible to either race or sex). We
then show using synthetic data that the current gold-standard method of
assessing intersectionalities in data (linear regression with multiplicative
interaction coefficients) fails to disambiguate between truly synergistic,
greater-than-the-sum-of-their-parts interactions, and redundant interactions.
We explore the significance of these two distinct types of interactions in the
context of making inferences about intersectional relationships in data and the
importance of being able to reliably differentiate the two. Finally, we
conclude that information theory, as a model-free framework sensitive to
nonlinearities and synergies in data, is a natural method by which to explore

on freeways whereby, after a critical density is reached, a state of congestion
sets in, but the freeway does not become decongested again until the density
drops well below the critical density. This introduces a hysteresis effect so
that it is easier to enter the congested state than to leave it. However, many
existing first-order models of traffic flow, particularly those used for
control design, ignore capacity drop, leading to suboptimal controllers. In
this paper, we consider a cell transmission model of traffic flow that
incorporates capacity drop to study the problem of optimal freeway ramp
metering. We show that, if capacity drop is ignored in the control design, then
the resulting controller, obtained via a convex program, may be significantly
suboptimal. We then propose an alternative model predictive controller that
accounts for capacity drop via a mixed integer linear program and show that,
for sufficiently large rollout horizon, this controller is optimal. We also
compare these approaches to a heuristic hand-crafted controller that is viewed
as a modification of an integral feedback controller to account for capacity
drop. This heuristic controller outperforms the controller that ignores
capacity drop but underperforms compared to the proposed alternative model
predictive controller. These results suggest that it is generally important to
include capacity drop in the controller design process, and we demonstrate this
insight on several case studies.

predictions from historical data (e.g., an optimizer that aims to recommend
fast routes relies upon travel-time predictions). Typically, learning the
prediction model used to generate the optimization problem and solving that
problem are performed in two separate stages. Recent work has showed how such
prediction models can be learned end-to-end by differentiating through the
optimization task. Such methods often yield empirical improvements, which are
typically attributed to end-to-end making better error tradeoffs than the
standard loss function used in a two-stage solution. We refine this explanation
and more precisely characterize when end-to-end can improve performance. When
prediction targets are stochastic, a two-stage solution must make an a priori
choice about which statistics of the target distribution to model-we consider
expectations over prediction targets-while an end-to-end solution can make this
choice adaptively. We show that the performance gap between a two-stage and
end-to-end approach is closely related to the price of correlation concept in
stochastic optimization and show the implications of some existing POC results
for the predict-then-optimize problem. We then consider a novel and
particularly practical setting, where multiple prediction targets are combined
to obtain each of the objective function's coefficients. We give explicit
constructions where (1) two-stage performs unboundedly worse than end-to-end;
and (2) two-stage is optimal. We use simulations to experimentally quantify
performance gaps and identify a wide range of real-world applications from the
literature whose objective functions rely on multiple prediction targets,

  profiles","16 pages, 21 figures, 1 table","A&A 653, A5 (2021)","10.1051/0004-6361/202140907",,"astro-ph.SR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Aims: We investigate a new method to for obtaining the plasma parameters of
solar prominences observed in the Mgii h&k spectral lines by comparing line
profiles from the IRIS satellite to a bank of profiles computed with a
one-dimensional non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) radiative
transfer code.
  Methods: Using a grid of 1007 one-dimensional non-LTE radiative transfer
models we carry out this new method to match computed spectra to observed line
profiles while accounting for line core shifts not present in the models. The
prominence observations were carried out by the IRIS satellite on 19 April
2018.
  Results: The prominence is very dynamic with many flows. The models are able
to recover satisfactory matches in areas of the prominence where single line
profiles are observed. We recover: mean temperatures of 6000 to 50,000K; mean
pressures of 0.01 to 0.5 dyne cm$^{-2}$; column masses of 3.7$\times10^{-8}$ to
5$\times10^{-4}$ g cm$^{-2}$; a mean electron density of 7.3$\times10^{8}$ to
1.8$\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$; and an ionisation degree
${n_\text{HII}}/{n_\text{HI}}=0.03 - 4500$. The highest values for the
ionisation degree are found in areas where the line of sight crosses mostly
plasma from the PCTR, correlating with high mean temperatures and
correspondingly no H$\alpha$ emission.
  Conclusions: This new method naturally returns information on how closely the
observed and computed profiles match, allowing the user to identify areas where
no satisfactory match between models and observations can be obtained. Regions
where satisfactory fits were found were more likely to contain a model
encompassing a PCTR. The line core shift can also be recovered from this new
method, and it shows a good qualitative match with that of the line core shift
found by the quantile method. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the
approach to line core shifts in the new method.

diagnosis has attracted increasing interest in recent years. However, most
existing methods require a large amount of labeled training data, which may not
be available for a target hospital that deploys a new Sepsis detection system.
More seriously, as treated patients are diversified between hospitals, directly
applying a model trained on other hospitals may not achieve good performance
for the target hospital. To address this issue, we propose a novel
semi-supervised transfer learning framework based on optimal transport theory
and self-paced ensemble for Sepsis early detection, called SPSSOT, which can
efficiently transfer knowledge from the source hospital (with rich labeled
data) to the target hospital (with scarce labeled data). Specifically, SPSSOT
incorporates a new optimal transport-based semi-supervised domain adaptation
component that can effectively exploit all the unlabeled data in the target
hospital. Moreover, self-paced ensemble is adapted in SPSSOT to alleviate the
class imbalance issue during transfer learning. In a nutshell, SPSSOT is an
end-to-end transfer learning method that automatically selects suitable samples
from two domains (hospitals) respectively and aligns their feature spaces.
Extensive experiments on two open clinical datasets, MIMIC-III and Challenge,
demonstrate that SPSSOT outperforms state-of-the-art transfer learning methods
by improving 1-3% of AUC.

rotating neutron stars (NSs). For the purpose we extend our previous work [1]
to introduce a light new physics vector mediator besides a scalar one in order
to ensure feeble interaction between fermionic DM and $\beta$ stable hadronic
matter in NSs. The masses of DM fermion, the mediators and the couplings are
chosen consistent with the self-interaction constraint from Bullet cluster and
from present day relic abundance. Assuming that both the scalar and vector
mediators contribute equally to the relic abundance, we compute the equation of
state (EoS) of the DM admixed NSs to find that the present consideration of the
vector new physics mediator do not bring any significant change to the EoS and
static NS properties of DM admixed NSs compared to the case where only the
scalar mediator was considered [1]. However, the obtained structural properties
in static conditions are in good agreement with the various constraints on them
from massive pulsars like PSR J0348+0432 and PSR J0740+6620, the gravitational
wave (GW170817) data and the recently obtained results of NICER experiments for
PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620. We also extended our work to compute the
rotational properties of DM admixed NSs rotating at different angular
velocities. The present results in this regard suggest that the secondary
component of GW190814 may be a rapidly rotating massive DM admixed NS. The
constraints on rotational frequency from pulsars like PSR B1937+21 and PSR
J1748-2446ad are also satisfied by our present results. Also, the constraints
on moment of inertia are satisfied considering slow rotation. The universality
relation in terms of normalized moment of inertia also holds good with our DM
admixed EoS.

construct robust representations for effective decision making. In the last
decade, deep networks are proven to be effective due to their ability to form
increasingly complex abstractions. However, these abstractions are distributed
over many neurons, making the re-use of a learned skill costly. Previous work
either enforced formation of abstractions creating a designer bias, or used a
large number of neural units without investigating how to obtain high-level
features that may more effectively capture the source task. For avoiding
designer bias and unsparing resource use, we propose to exploit neural response
dynamics to form compact representations to use in skill transfer. For this, we
consider two competing methods based on (1) maximum information compression
principle and (2) the notion that abstract events tend to generate slowly
changing signals, and apply them to the neural signals generated during task
execution. To be concrete, in our simulation experiments, we either apply
principal component analysis (PCA) or slow feature analysis (SFA) on the
signals collected from the last hidden layer of a deep network while it
performs a source task, and use these features for skill transfer in a new
target task. We compare the generalization performance of these alternatives
with the baselines of skill transfer with full layer output and no-transfer
settings. Our results show that SFA units are the most successful for skill
transfer. SFA as well as PCA, incur less resources compared to usual skill
transfer, whereby many units formed show a localized response reflecting
end-effector-obstacle-goal relations. Finally, SFA units with lowest
eigenvalues resembles symbolic representations that highly correlate with
high-level features such as joint angles which might be thought of precursors
for fully symbolic systems.

opportunities to enable a variety of emerging services in a smart home
environment. Among those services, sensing the liquid level in a container is
critical to building many smart home and mobile healthcare applications that
improve the quality of life. This paper presents LiquidSense, a liquid-level
sensing system that is low-cost, high accuracy, widely applicable to different
daily liquids and containers, and can be easily integrated with existing smart
home networks. LiquidSense uses an existing home WiFi network and a low-cost
transducer that attached to the container to sense the resonance of the
container for liquid level detection. In particular, our system mounts a
low-cost transducer on the surface of the container and emits a well-designed
chirp signal to make the container resonant, which introduces subtle changes to
the home WiFi signals. By analyzing the subtle phase changes of the WiFi
signals, LiquidSense extracts the resonance frequency as a feature for liquid
level detection. Our system constructs prediction models for both continuous
and discrete predictions using curve fitting and SVM respectively. We evaluate
LiquidSense in home environments with containers of three different materials
and six types of liquids. Results show that LiquidSense achieves an overall
accuracy of 97% for continuous prediction and an overall F-score of 0.968 for
discrete prediction. Results also show that our system has a large coverage in
a home environment and works well under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios.

model and tracer kinetics in an integrated framework. Due to limited counts
received, signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and resolution of parametric images
produced by direct reconstruction frameworks are still limited. Recently
supervised deep learning methods have been successfully applied to medical
imaging denoising/reconstruction when large number of high-quality training
labels are available. For static PET imaging, high-quality training labels can
be acquired by extending the scanning time. However, this is not feasible for
dynamic PET imaging, where the scanning time is already long enough. In this
work, we proposed an unsupervised deep learning framework for direct parametric
reconstruction from dynamic PET, which was tested on the Patlak model and the
relative equilibrium Logan model. The patient's anatomical prior image, which
is readily available from PET/CT or PET/MR scans, was supplied as the network
input to provide a manifold constraint, and also utilized to construct a kernel
layer to perform non-local feature denoising. The linear kinetic model was
embedded in the network structure as a 1x1 convolution layer. The training
objective function was based on the PET statistical model. Evaluations based on
dynamic datasets of 18F-FDG and 11C-PiB tracers show that the proposed
framework can outperform the traditional and the kernel method-based direct

typically deployed in production blockchains, face a clear trade-off: (1) they
either achieve linear communication cost in the happy path, but sacrifice
liveness during periods of asynchrony, or (2) they are robust (progress with
probability one) but pay quadratic communication cost. We believe this
trade-off is unwarranted since existing linear protocols still have asymptotic
quadratic cost in the worst case. We design Ditto, a Byzantine SMR protocol
that enjoys the best of both worlds: optimal communication on and off the happy
path (linear and quadratic, respectively) and progress guarantee under
asynchrony and DDoS attacks. We achieve this by replacing the
view-synchronization of partially synchronous protocols with an asynchronous
fallback mechanism at no extra asymptotic cost. Specifically, we start from
HotStuff, a state-of-the-art linear protocol, and gradually build Ditto. As a
separate contribution and an intermediate step, we design a 2-chain version of
HotStuff, Jolteon, which leverages a quadratic view-change mechanism to reduce
the latency of the standard 3-chain HotStuff. We implement and experimentally
evaluate all our systems. Notably, Jolteon's commit latency outperforms
HotStuff by 200-300ms with varying system size. Additionally, Ditto adapts to
the network and provides better performance than Jolteon under faulty

local barometer potential that is built into the many-particle Hamiltonian.
Such a setup allows the pressure to be locally defined, at an arbitrary point

force exerted by the barometer potential on the gas' particles. This setup is
further used to give a microscopic derivation of the generalized Archimedes's

instructive examples, buoyancy force fields are calculated for ideal fluids in
the presence of: i) a uniform force field, ii) a spherically symmetric harmonic

belong to $k$ unknown groups (or clusters), our goal is to recover the clusters
by asking pairwise queries to an oracle. This oracle can answer the query that
``do items $u$ and $v$ belong to the same cluster?''. However, the answer to
each pairwise query errs with probability $\varepsilon$, for some
$\varepsilon\in(0,\frac12)$. Mazumdar and Saha provided two algorithms under
this model: one algorithm is query-optimal while time-inefficient (i.e.,
running in quasi-polynomial time), the other is time efficient (i.e., in
polynomial time) while query-suboptimal. Larsen, Mitzenmacher and Tsourakakis
[WWW 2020] then gave a new time-efficient algorithm for the special case of $2$
clusters, which is query-optimal if the bias $\delta:=1-2\varepsilon$ of the
model is large. It was left as an open question whether one can obtain a
query-optimal, time-efficient algorithm for the general case of $k$ clusters
and other regimes of $\delta$.
  In this paper, we make progress on the above question and provide a
time-efficient algorithm with nearly-optimal query complexity (up to a factor
of $O(\log^2 n)$) for all constant $k$ and any $\delta$ in the regime when
information-theoretic recovery is possible. Our algorithm is built on a
connection to the stochastic block model.

measure the angular momentum (AM) of sets of particles in an SPH simulation of
the formation, collapse and fragmentation of giant MCs. The sets of SPH
particles are defined either as ``clumps'' (connected particle sets), or as
lagrangian sets that conform a connected clump only at a certain time $\tdef$.
We find that: {\it i)} Clumps evolve along the observed \jR\ relation at all

based on temporal coding are expected to be much more efficient than those
based on rate coding, because the former requires substantially fewer spikes to
carry out tasks. As SNNs are continuous-state and continuous-time models, it is
favorable to implement them with analog VLSI circuits. However, the
construction of the entire system with continuous-time analog circuits would be
infeasible when the system size is very large. Therefore, mixed-signal circuits
must be employed, and the time discretization and quantization of the synaptic
weights are necessary. Moreover, the analog VLSI implementation of SNNs
exhibits non-idealities, such as the effects of noise and device mismatches, as
well as other constraints arising from the analog circuit operation. In this
study, we investigated the effects of the time discretization and/or weight
quantization on the performance of SNNs. Furthermore, we elucidated the effects

preserving its cut structure has been extensively studied and has many
applications. In a seminal work, Bencz\'ur and Karger (1996) showed that given
any $n$-vertex undirected weighted graph $G$ and a parameter $\varepsilon \in
(0,1)$, there is a near-linear time algorithm that outputs a weighted subgraph
$G'$ of $G$ of size $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon^2)$ such that the weight of every
cut in $G$ is preserved to within a $(1 \pm \varepsilon)$-factor in $G'$. The
graph $G'$ is referred to as a {\em $(1 \pm \varepsilon)$-approximate cut
sparsifier} of $G$. Subsequent recent work has obtained a similar result for
the more general problem of hypergraph cut sparsifiers. However, all known
sparsification algorithms require $\Omega(n + m)$ time where $n$ denotes the
number of vertices and $m$ denotes the number of hyperedges in the hypergraph.
Since $m$ can be exponentially large in $n$, a natural question is if it is
possible to create a hypergraph cut sparsifier in time polynomial in $n$, {\em
independent of the number of edges}. We resolve this question in the
affirmative, giving the first sublinear time algorithm for this problem, given

roles in scientific fields such as epidemiology and ecology, yet the standard
approach to extending an ordinary differential equation model to a Markov chain

data. To handle that, over-dispersed Markov chains have previously been
constructed using gamma white noise on the rates. We develop new approaches
using Dirichlet noise to construct collections of independent or dependent
noise processes. This permits the modeling of high-frequency variation in
transition rates both within and between the populations under study. Our
theory is developed in a general framework of time-inhomogeneous Markov
processes equipped with a graphical structure, for which ecological and
epidemiological models provide motivating examples. We demonstrate our approach
on a widely analyzed measles dataset, adding Dirichlet noise to a classical
SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) model. Our methodology shows
improved statistical fit measured by log-likelihood and provides new insights
into the dynamics of this biological system.

using the visco-resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations. Results
presented here show that the inclusion of self-consistent viscosity and
resistivity in the system drastically changes the growth of the Rayleigh-Taylor
instability (RTI) as well as modifies its internal structure at smaller scales.
It is seen here that the viscosity has a stabilizing effect on the RTI.
Moreover, the viscosity inhibits the development of small scale structures and
also modifies the morphology of the tip of the RTI spikes. On the other hand,
the resistivity reduces the magnetic field stabilization supporting the
development of small scale structures. The morphology of the RTI spikes is seen
to be unaffected by the presence of resistivity in the system. An additional
novelty of this work is in the disparate viscosity and resistivity profiles
that may exist in HED plasmas and their impact on RTI growth, morphology, and
the resulting turbulence spectra. Furthermore, this work shows that the
dynamics of the magnetic field is independent of viscosity and likewise the
resistivity does not affect the dissipation of enstrophy and kinetic energy. In
addition, power-law scalings of enstrophy, kinetic energy, and magnetic field
energy are provided in both injection range and inertial sub-range which could
be useful for understanding RTI induced turbulent mixing in HED laboratory and

The purpose of pre-silicon verification is to find logic bugs in a design at an
early stage and thus avoid time- and cost-intensive post-silicon debugging. Our
approach relies on symbolic quick error detection (Symbolic QED, or SQED). SQED
is targeted at finding logic bugs in a symbolic representation of a design by
combining bounded model checking (BMC) with QED tests. QED tests are powerful
in generating short sequences of instructions (traces) that trigger bugs. We
extend an existing SQED approach with symbolic starting states. This way, we
enable the BMC tool to select starting states arbitrarily when generating a
trace. To avoid false positives, (e.g., traces starting in unreachable states
that may not be-have in accordance with the processor instruction-set
architecture), we define constraints to restrict the set of possible starting
states. We demonstrate that these constraints, togeth-er with reasonable
assumptions about the system behavior, allow us to avoid false positives. Using
our approach, we discovered previously unknown bugs in open-source RISC-V
processor cores that existing methods cannot detect. Moreover, our novel
approach out-performs existing ones in the detection of bugs having long traces
and in the detection of hardware Trojans, i.e., unauthorized modifications of a
design.

inverse reinforcement learning, usually make strong assumptions about the
observability of the human's environment. However, in reality, people make many
important decisions under uncertainty. To better understand preference learning
in these cases, we study the setting of inverse decision theory (IDT), a
previously proposed framework where a human is observed making non-sequential
binary decisions under uncertainty. In IDT, the human's preferences are
conveyed through their loss function, which expresses a tradeoff between
different types of mistakes. We give the first statistical analysis of IDT,
providing conditions necessary to identify these preferences and characterizing
the sample complexity -- the number of decisions that must be observed to learn
the tradeoff the human is making to a desired precision. Interestingly, we show
that it is actually easier to identify preferences when the decision problem is
more uncertain. Furthermore, uncertain decision problems allow us to relax the
unrealistic assumption that the human is an optimal decision maker but still
identify their exact preferences; we give sample complexities in this
suboptimal case as well. Our analysis contradicts the intuition that partial
observability should make preference learning more difficult. It also provides
a first step towards understanding and improving preference learning methods
for uncertain and suboptimal humans.

equilibrium state that is devoid of temperature gradients. The distance to

consequence of diffusion and mixing by convection. The presence of particles
can modify the thermal entrance length due to interphase heat transfer and
turbulence modulation by momentum coupling. In this work, Eulerian--Lagrangian
simulations are utilized to probe the effect of solids heterogeneity (e.g.,
clustering) on the thermal entrance length. For the moderately dense systems
considered here, clustering leads to a factor of 2--3 increase in the thermal
entrance length, as compared to an uncorrelated (perfectly mixed) distribution
of particles. The observed increase is found to be primarily due to the
covariance between volume fraction and temperature fluctuations, referred to as
the fluid drift temperature. Using scaling arguments and Gene Expression

show that the gamma-ray PDF also carries information about the velocity

PDF assuming $s$-wave and Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilation, we perform a mock
data analysis to illustrate how current and future observations can constrain

can potentially distinguish the non-Poissonian fluctuations expected from dark

can be designed to simultaneously achieve system efficiency and equity
objectives. In this work, we bridge this gap through the study of
\emph{congestion pricing and revenue refunding} (CPRR) schemes in non-atomic
congestion games. We first develop CPRR schemes, which in comparison to the
untolled case, simultaneously increase system efficiency without worsening
wealth inequality, while being \emph{user-favorable}: irrespective of their
initial wealth or values-of-time (which may differ across users), users would
experience a lower travel cost after the implementation of the proposed scheme.
We then characterize the set of optimal user-favorable CPRR schemes that
simultaneously maximize system efficiency and minimize wealth inequality.
Finally, we provide a concrete methodology for computing optimal CPRR schemes
and also highlight additional equilibrium properties of these schemes under
different models of user behavior. Overall, our work demonstrates that through
appropriate refunding policies we can design user-favorable CPRR schemes that
maximize system efficiency while reducing wealth inequality.

allocation problems in economic theory, wherein agents spend a budget of
currency to buy goods that maximize their utilities, while producers sell
capacity constrained goods in exchange for currency. However, the consideration
of only two types of constraints, i.e., budgets of individual buyers and
capacities of goods, makes Fisher markets less amenable for resource allocation
settings when agents have additional linear constraints, e.g., knapsack and
proportionality constraints. In this work, we introduce a modified Fisher
market, where each agent may have additional linear constraints and show that
this modification to classical Fisher markets fundamentally alters the
properties of the market equilibrium as well as the optimal allocations. These
properties of the modified Fisher market prompt us to introduce a budget
perturbed social optimization problem (BP-SOP) and set prices based on the dual
variables of BP-SOP's capacity constraints. To compute the budget
perturbations, we develop a fixed point iterative scheme and validate its
convergence through numerical experiments.
  Since this fixed point iterative scheme involves solving a centralized
problem at each step, we propose a new class of distributed algorithms to
compute equilibrium prices. In particular, we develop an Alternating Direction
Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm with strong convergence guarantees for
Fisher markets with homogeneous linear constraints as well as for classical
Fisher markets. In this algorithm, the prices are updated based on the
tatonnement process, with a step size that is completely independent of the
utilities of individual agents. Thus, our mechanism, both theoretically and
computationally, overcomes a fundamental limitation of classical Fisher

It is demonstrated that a prominent acceleration mechanism is the nonlinear

including the lower hybrid drift (LHD) instability, modified two-stream (MTS)
instability and electron cyclotron drift (ECD) instability. Test-particle
simulations show that the observed spectrum of waves can rapidly accelerate

is related to the surfatron mechanism at shocks but through the coupling with
the stochastic heating condition it produces significant acceleration on much
shorter temporal and spatial scales by the interaction with bursts of waves
within a cyclotron period. The results of this paper are built on the heritage
of four-point measurement techniques developed for the Cluster mission and
imply that the concepts of Fermi acceleration, diffusive shock acceleration,

direct maximum likelihood estimation, we provide both negative and positive
answers under the known transition setting. For some MDPs, we show that vanilla
AIL has a worse sample complexity than BC. The key insight is that the

poorly even on visited states from the expert demonstrations. For another class
of MDPs, vanilla AIL is proved to generalize well even on non-visited states.
Interestingly, its sample complexity is horizon-free, which provably beats BC

(JADCE) problem as a group-sparse matrix estimation problem. This problem can
be solved by applying the existing compressed sensing techniques, which however
either suffer from high computational complexities or lack of algorithm
robustness. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm unrolling framework based
on the deep neural network to simultaneously achieve low computational
complexity and high robustness for solving the JADCE problem. Specifically, we
map the original iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm (ISTA) into an
unrolled recurrent neural network (RNN), thereby improving the convergence rate
and computational efficiency through end-to-end training. Moreover, the
proposed algorithm unrolling approach inherits the structure and domain
knowledge of the ISTA, thereby maintaining the algorithm robustness, which can
handle non-Gaussian preamble sequence matrix in massive access. With rigorous
theoretical analysis, we further simplify the unrolled network structure by
reducing the redundant training parameters. Furthermore, we prove that the
simplified unrolled deep neural network structures enjoy a linear convergence
rate. Extensive simulations based on various preamble signatures show that the
proposed unrolled networks outperform the existing methods in terms of the
convergence rate, robustness and estimation accuracy.

various global scandals, transformation of media, technological change,
obstacles to deliberative democracy, and other factors. Press freedom is
frequently used also as an explanatory factor in comparative empirical
research. However, validations of existing measurement instruments on press
freedom have been far and few between. Given these points, this paper evaluates
eight cross-country instruments on press freedom in 147 countries between 2001
and 2020, replicating an earlier study with a comparable research setup. The
methodology is based on principal component analysis and multi-level regression
modeling. According to the results, the construct (convergence) validity of the
instruments is good; they all measure the same underlying semi-narrow
definition for press freedom elaborated in the paper. In addition, any of the
indices seems suitable to be used interchangeability in empirical research.
Limitations and future research directions are further discussed.

non-noetherian valuation rings are the main examples of MTL-rings which are not

due to their state-of-the-art performance. Most deep steganalysis classifiers
usually extract noise residuals using high-pass filters as preprocessing steps
and feed them to their deep model for classification. It is observed that
recent steganographic embedding does not always restrict their embedding in the
high-frequency zone; instead, they distribute it as per embedding policy.
Therefore, besides noise residual, learning the embedding zone is another
challenging task. In this work, unlike the conventional approaches, the
proposed model first extracts the noise residual using learned denoising
kernels to boost the signal-to-noise ratio. After preprocessing, the sparse
noise residuals are fed to a novel Multi-Contextual Convolutional Neural
Network (M-CNET) that uses heterogeneous context size to learn the sparse and
low-amplitude representation of noise residuals. The model performance is
further improved by incorporating the Self-Attention module to focus on the
areas prone to steganalytic embedding. A set of comprehensive experiments is
performed to show the proposed scheme's efficacy over the prior arts. Besides,
an ablation study is given to justify the contribution of various modules of

the server's update directions, the minibatch sizes, and the local update
frequency, so that the WNs use the minimum number of samples and communication
rounds to achieve the desired solution. This work addresses the above question
and considers a class of stochastic algorithms where the WNs perform a few
local updates before communication. We show that when both the WN's and the
server's directions are chosen based on a stochastic momentum estimator, the
algorithm requires $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-3/2})$ samples and
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-1})$ communication rounds to compute an
$\epsilon$-stationary solution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
FL algorithm that achieves such {\it near-optimal} sample and communication
complexities simultaneously. Further, we show that there is a trade-off curve
between local update frequencies and local minibatch sizes, on which the above
sample and communication complexities can be maintained. Finally, we show that
for the classical FedAvg (a.k.a. Local SGD, which is a momentum-less special
case of the STEM), a similar trade-off curve exists, albeit with worse sample

guidelines for choosing the four important design elements for FL algorithms,

information on device activities and inter-cell interference. In this paper,
given different numbers of observations and network parameters, we consider
both non-cooperative device activity detection and cooperative device activity
detection in a multi-cell network, consisting of many access points (APs) and
IoT devices. Under each activity detection mechanism, we consider the joint
maximum likelihood (ML) estimation and joint maximum a posterior probability
(MAP) estimation of both device activities and interference powers, utilizing
tools from probability, stochastic geometry, and optimization. Each estimation
problem is a challenging non-convex problem, and a coordinate descent algorithm
is proposed to obtain a stationary point. Each proposed joint ML estimation
extends the existing one for a single-cell network by considering the
estimation of interference powers, together with the estimation of device
activities. Each proposed joint MAP estimation further enhances the
corresponding joint ML estimation by exploiting prior distributions of device
activities and interference powers. The proposed joint ML estimation and joint
MAP estimation under cooperative detection outperform the respective ones under
non-cooperative detection at the costs of increasing backhaul burden, knowledge
of network parameters, and computational complexities.

massive star. The intense outflows from the star can absorb radio emission from
the pulsar, making the detection of pulsation difficult. In this work, we
present the basic geometry and formulae that describe the absorption process of
a pulsar in binary with an O/B star and apply our model to two typical and
well-studied binaries: PSR~B1259-63/LS~2883 and LS 5039. We investigate the
influences of the equatorial disc of LS 2883 with different orientations on the
dispersion measure and free-free absorption of the radio pulsation from PSR
B1259-63. The observed data are consistent with the disc inserted on the
orbital plane with a relatively large inclination angle. For LS 5039, due to
its tight orbit, it was believed that the strong wind absorption makes
detecting radio emissions from the putative pulsar unlikely. However,
considering the wind interaction and orbital motion, a bow shock cavity and a
Coriolis shock would be formed, thereby allowing the pulsations to partially
avoid stellar outflow absorption. We investigate the dependence of the radio
optical depth on the observing frequencies, the orbital inclination angle, and
the wind parameters. We suppose that the presumptive pulsar in LS 5039 is
similar to PSR B1259-63 with pulsed emission extending to several tens of
gigahertz. In that case, there could be a transparent window for radio
pulsations when the pulsar is moving around the inferior conjunction. The
following deep monitoring of LS 5039 and other systems by radio telescopes at

  Question Answering","ACL 2021",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Video Question Answering is a task which requires an AI agent to answer
questions grounded in video. This task entails three key challenges: (1)
understand the intention of various questions, (2) capturing various elements
of the input video (e.g., object, action, causality), and (3) cross-modal
grounding between language and vision information. We propose Motion-Appearance
Synergistic Networks (MASN), which embed two cross-modal features grounded on
motion and appearance information and selectively utilize them depending on the
question's intentions. MASN consists of a motion module, an appearance module,
and a motion-appearance fusion module. The motion module computes the
action-oriented cross-modal joint representations, while the appearance module
focuses on the appearance aspect of the input video. Finally, the
motion-appearance fusion module takes each output of the motion module and the
appearance module as input, and performs question-guided fusion. As a result,
MASN achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the TGIF-QA and MSVD-QA
datasets. We also conduct qualitative analysis by visualizing the inference
results of MASN. The code is available at

  Vehicle-to-Vehicle Networks","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2103.00883",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) is a vehicular technology that
allows groups of vehicles on the highway to form in closely-coupled automated
platoons to increase highway capacity and safety, and decrease fuel consumption
and CO2 emissions. The underlying mechanism behind CACC is the use of
Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) wireless communication networks to transmit
acceleration commands to adjacent vehicles in the platoon. However, the use of
V2V networks leads to increased vulnerabilities against faults and cyberattacks
at the communication channels. Communication networks serve as new access
points for malicious agents trying to deteriorate the platooning performance or
even cause crashes. Here, we address the problem of increasing robustness of
CACC schemes against cyberattacks by the use of multiple V2V networks and a
data fusion algorithm. The idea is to transmit acceleration commands multiple
times through different communication networks (channels) to create redundancy
at the receiver side. We exploit this redundancy to obtain attack-free
estimates of acceleration commands. To accomplish this, we propose a
data-fusion algorithm that takes data from all channels, returns an estimate of
the true acceleration command, and isolates compromised channels. Note,
however, that using estimated data for control introduces uncertainty into the
loop and thus decreases performance. To minimize performance degradation, we
propose a robust $H_{\infty}$ controller that reduces the joint effect of
estimation errors and sensor/channel noise in the platooning performance
(tracking performance and string stability). We present simulation results to
illustrate the performance of our approach.

of random walks (RWs) on random regular graphs (RRGs) consisting of $N$ nodes
of degree $c \ge 3$. Starting from a random initial node $i$ at time $t=0$, at
each time step $t \ge 1$ an RW hops into a random neighbor of its previous
node. We calculate the distribution $P ( T_{\rm FR} = t )$ of first return
times to the initial node $i$. We distinguish between first return trajectories
in which the RW retrocedes its own steps backwards all the way back to the
initial node $i$ and those in which the RW returns to $i$ via a path that does
not retrocede its own steps. In the retroceding scenario, each edge that
belongs to the RW trajectory is crossed the same number of times in the forward
and backward directions. In the non-retroceding scenario the subgraph that
consists of the nodes visited by the RW and the edges it has crossed between
these nodes includes at least one cycle. In the limit of $N \rightarrow \infty$
the RRG converges towards the Bethe lattice. The Bethe lattice exhibits a tree
structure, in which all the first return trajectories belong to the retroceding
scenario. Moreover, in the limit of $N \rightarrow \infty$ the trajectories of
RWs on RRGs are transient in the sense that they return to the initial node
with probability $<1$. In this sense they resemble the trajectories of RWs on
regular lattices of dimensions $d \ge 3$. The analytical results are found to
be in excellent agreement with the results obtained from computer simulations.

sub-sequence in the time series, we can apply a simple aggregation over the
representations of corresponding timestamps. We conduct extensive experiments
on time series classification tasks to evaluate the quality of time series
representations. As a result, TS2Vec achieves significant improvement over
existing SOTAs of unsupervised time series representation on 125 UCR datasets
and 29 UEA datasets. The learned timestamp-level representations also achieve
superior results in time series forecasting and anomaly detection tasks. A
linear regression trained on top of the learned representations outperforms
previous SOTAs of time series forecasting. Furthermore, we present a simple way
to apply the learned representations for unsupervised anomaly detection, which

  strain effect",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Van der Waals heterostructures are constructed by stacking different atomic
layers and can inherit many novel electronic and optical properties from the
constituting atomic layers. Mechanical stability is of key importance for the
high performance of nano devices based on the van der Waals heterostructure. In
particular, buckling instability is a critical mechanical issue for the
heterostructure due to its two-dimensional nature. Using graphene/MoS$_2$
heterostructure as an example, the present work demonstrates the relationship
between the buckling instability and the inevitable misfit strain in the
heterostructure by molecular dynamics simulations. The misfit strain has rather
different effects on the buckling phenomenon depending on the magnitude of the
misfit strain.
  (1) For negative misfit strain, the buckling stability of the heterostructure
is reduced by the misfit strain. It is because the graphene layer, which
initiates the buckling process in the heterostructure of negative misfit
strain, is pre-compressed by the misfit strain that accelerates the buckling of
the graphene layer.
  (2) For small positive misfit strain, the buckling stability for the
graphene/MoS$_2$ heterostructure is elevated. The underlying mechanism is that
the graphene layer initiates the buckling process of the heterostructure and is
pre-stretched by the small positive misfit strain, which decelerates the
buckling of the graphene layer.
  (3) For large positive misfit strain, the graphene layer is pre-stretched
while the MoS$_2$ layer is considerably pre-compressed, so the buckling of the
heterostructure is initiated by the MoS$_2$ layer. As a consequence, the
buckling stability of the graphene/MoS$_2$ heterostructure is reduced by the
increase of large positive misfit strain. These findings shall be valuable for
understanding mechanical properties of van der Waals heterostructures.

due to its high efficiency. This framework first selects salient sentences and
then independently condenses each of the selected sentences into a concise
version. However, compressing sentences separately ignores the context
information of the document, and is therefore prone to delete salient
information. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
condense-then-select framework for text summarization. Our framework first
concurrently condenses each document sentence. Original document sentences and
their compressed versions then become the candidates for extraction. Finally,
an extractor utilizes the context information of the document to select
candidates and assembles them into a summary. If salient information is deleted
during condensing, the extractor can select an original sentence to retain the
information. Thus, our framework helps to avoid the loss of salient
information, while preserving the high efficiency of sentence-level
compression. Experiment results on the CNN/DailyMail, DUC-2002, and Pubmed

by flow recirculation and wall friction with a friction factor, which enables
us to derive quasi-one-dimensional equations from conservation laws. The model
is valid for both compact nozzles and nozzles with a spatial extent. Second,
the predictions from the proposed model are compared against the experimental

from subsonic to supersonic regimes (with and without shock waves). The
acoustic transfer functions vary significantly because of non-isentropic

Finally, we calculate the effect that the friction of a nozzle guide vane has
on thermoacoustic stability. It is found that the friction and the Helmholtz

linearly unstable regime. The study opens up new possibilities for the accurate

network paths and path length. Starting from the Price model of network growth,
we derive an exact solution for the path length distribution of all unique
paths from a given initial node to each node in the network. We study the
relative importance of the average in-degree and cumulative advantage effect
and implement a generalization where the in-degree depends on the number of

length growth. As the collection of all unique paths may contain many
redundancies, we additionally consider the subset of the longest paths to each

longest path length distribution in a simple context. Where the number of all
unique paths of a given length grows unbounded, the number of longest paths of
a given length converges to a finite limit, which depends exponentially on the

various computer vision tasks but rely on tremendous computational cost. To
solve this problem, existing approaches either compress well-trained
large-scale models or learn lightweight models with carefully designed network
structures. In this work, we make a close study of the convolution operator,
which is the basic unit used in CNNs, to reduce its computing load. In
particular, we propose a compact convolution module, called CompConv, to
facilitate efficient feature learning. With the divide-and-conquer strategy,
CompConv is able to save a great many computations as well as parameters to
produce a certain dimensional feature map. Furthermore, CompConv discreetly
integrates the input features into the outputs to efficiently inherit the input
information. More importantly, the novel CompConv is a plug-and-play module
that can be directly applied to modern CNN structures to replace the vanilla
convolution layers without further effort. Extensive experimental results
suggest that CompConv can adequately compress the benchmark CNN structures yet
barely sacrifice the performance, surpassing other competitors.

we reduce the kinetic equation to a coupled mode problem which encompasses all
versions of second order viscous hydrodynamics for Bjorken flows. This coupled
mode problem is analysed first using techniques of linear algebra. Then we
transform this two mode problem into a single non linear differential equation
and proceed to a fixed point analysis. We identify an attractor solution as the
particular solution of this non linear equation that joins two fixed points:
one corresponding to the collisionless, early time regime, the other
corresponding to late time hydrodynamics. We exploit the analytic solution of
this equation in order to test several approximations and to identify generic
features of the transition to hydrodynamics. We argue that extending the
accuracy of hydrodynamics to early time, i.e. to the region of large gradients,
amounts essentially to improve the accuracy of the location of the
collisionless fixed point. This is demonstrated by showing that a simple
renormalisation of a second order transport coefficient puts the free streaming
fixed point at the right location, and allows us to reproduce accurately the
full solution of the kinetic equation within second order viscous
hydrodynamics, even in regimes far from local equilibrium.

Furthermore, the underlying network topology among the agents does not need to
be balanced. To achieve the goal of NE seeking within such a context, two
estimates are constructed for each agent, namely, an estimate of partial
derivatives of the cost function and an estimate of global state values, based
on which, an iterative state updating law is elaborately designed. Linear
convergence of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated. It is shown that the

The main factor why a passenger chooses a specific path is usually based on its

more expensive ones. In this paper, we deal with the cheapest ticket problem
which asks for a cheapest ticket to travel between a pair of stations. The
complexity and the algorithmic approach to solve this problem depend crucially
on the underlying fare structure, e.g., it is easy if the ticket prices are
proportional to the distance traveled (as in distance tariff fare structures),
but may become NP-complete in zone tariff fare structures. We hence discuss the
cheapest ticket problem for different variations of distance- and zone-based
fare structures. We start by modeling the respective fare structure
mathematically, identify its main properties, and finally provide a polynomial
algorithm, or prove NP-completeness of the cheapest ticket problem. We also
provide general results on the combination of two fare structures, which is
often observed in practice.

for approaches such as test case prioritization (TCP) and test-suite reduction
to reach better results in case of limited resources. In this regard, proposing
approaches that use auxiliary sources of data such as bug history can be
interesting.
  Objective: Our aim is to propose an approach for TCP that takes into account
test case coverage data, bug history, and test case diversification. To
evaluate this approach we study its performance on real-world open-source
projects.
  Method: The bug history is used to estimate the fault-proneness of source
code areas. The diversification of test cases is preserved by incorporating
fault-proneness on a clustering-based approach scheme.
  Results: The proposed methods are evaluated on datasets collected from the
development history of five real-world projects including 357 versions in

coverage-based TCP methods.

Recently, phenotypes such as skin-tone, have been proposed as superior
alternatives to traditional race categories when exploring performance
differentials. However, there is little consensus regarding how to
appropriately measure skin-tone in evaluations of biometric performance or in
AI more broadly. In this study, we explore the relationship between
face-area-lightness-measures (FALMs) estimated from images and ground-truth
skin readings collected using a device designed to measure human skin. FALMs
estimated from different images of the same individual varied significantly
relative to ground-truth FALM. This variation was only reduced by greater
control of acquisition (camera, background, and environment). Next, we compare
ground-truth FALM to Fitzpatrick Skin Types (FST) categories obtained using the
standard, in-person, medical survey and show FST is poorly predictive of
skin-tone. Finally, we show how noisy estimation of FALM leads to errors
selecting explanatory factors for demographic differentials. These results
demonstrate that measures of skin-tone for biometric performance evaluations
must come from objective, characterized, and controlled sources. Further,
despite this being a currently practiced approach, estimating FST categories
and FALMs from uncontrolled imagery does not provide an appropriate measure of
skin-tone.

speech recognition performance, and for many individuals with
moderate-to-severe speech disorders, voice operated systems do not work.
Current speech recognition systems are trained primarily with data from fluent
speakers and as a consequence do not generalize well to speech with
dysfluencies such as sound or word repetitions, sound prolongations, or audible
blocks. The focus of this work is on quantitative analysis of a consumer speech
recognition system on individuals who stutter and production-oriented
approaches for improving performance for common voice assistant tasks (i.e.,
""what is the weather?""). At baseline, this system introduces a significant
number of insertion and substitution errors resulting in intended speech Word
Error Rates (isWER) that are 13.64\% worse (absolute) for individuals with
fluency disorders. We show that by simply tuning the decoding parameters in an
existing hybrid speech recognition system one can improve isWER by 24\%
(relative) for individuals with fluency disorders. Tuning these parameters
translates to 3.6\% better domain recognition and 1.7\% better intent
recognition relative to the default setup for the 18 study participants across
all stuttering severities.

application scenarios. Since the production of a commercial GAN requires
substantial computational and human resources, the copyright protection of GANs

stealthiness and robustness bottlenecks suffered by previous fingerprinting
methods for classification models being naively transferred to GANs.
Specifically, we innovatively construct a composite deep learning model from
the target GAN and a classifier. Then we generate fingerprint samples from this
composite model, and embed them in the classifier for effective ownership
verification. This scheme inspires some concrete methodologies to practically
protect the modern GAN models. Theoretical analysis proves that these methods
can satisfy different security requirements necessary for IP protection. We
also conduct extensive experiments to show that our solutions outperform
existing strategies.

  Networks and State Forecasting Via Recurrent Neural Networks",,,,,"eess.SP cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Power grids play a very important role in delivering electrical energy to
homes, industries and other places that require it. Because of this increased
demand they are facing a great challenge of voltage variations. This happens
due to varied use of energy-consuming devices and appliances like electric
vehicles, industrial consumption, occasional peak in energy demands etc. For
these fluctuations in demands, it becomes extremely important to monitor the
conditions at which the power grid operates. Once these conditions are known,
the energy production can be manipulated to meet the demand. It has been found
that the existing Power System State Estimation (PSSE) techniques may not be
good in producing optimal Performance. Moreover, they are also expensive in
terms of computational processing. To address this problem, this research
proposes a state estimation method for power grids using Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN). It was found that the model produced an RMSE of 2.57 x 10-4,
which was comparatively accurate than one of previous studies involved in
making the estimation using a Prox Linear Model (2.97 x 10-4).
  Furthermore, the research also proposes Power System State Forecasting for
improving system awareness and resilience. The forecasting is carried out using
a model of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). This model helps in accounting for
long-term nonlinear aspects present in data and based on that it does the
forecasting. The proposed model forecasted with a RMSE of 2.53 x 10-3, which is
comparatively equal to the previous study mentioned above (2.59 x 10-3).

the choice set generation process, in which the likelihood of perceiving chosen

  Slight rewrite of some sections 18 pages,19 figures",,,,"math.NA cs.CE cs.LG cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Temporally and spatially dependent uncertain parameters are regularly
encountered in engineering applications. Commonly these uncertainties are
accounted for using random fields and processes, which require knowledge about
the appearing probability distributions functions that is not readily
available. In these cases non-probabilistic approaches such as interval
analysis and fuzzy set theory are helpful uncertainty measures. Partial
differential equations involving fuzzy and interval fields are traditionally
solved using the finite element method where the input fields are sampled using
some basis function expansion methods. This approach however is problematic, as
it is reliant on knowledge about the spatial correlation fields. In this work
we utilize physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve interval and fuzzy
partial differential equations. The resulting network structures termed
interval physics-informed neural networks (iPINNs) and fuzzy physics-informed
neural networks (fPINNs) show promising results for obtaining bounded solutions
of equations involving spatially and/or temporally uncertain parameter fields.
In contrast to finite element approaches, no correlation length specification
of the input fields as well as no Monte-Carlo simulations are necessary. In
fact, information about the input interval fields is obtained directly as a
byproduct of the presented solution scheme. Furthermore, all major advantages
of PINNs are retained, i.e. meshfree nature of the scheme, and ease of inverse
problem set-up.

aggregation-based discrete extension operators for the numerical approximation
of elliptic partial differential equations on unfitted meshes. We explore the
behavior of ghost penalty methods in the limit as the penalty parameter goes to
infinity, which returns a strong version of these methods. We observe that
these methods suffer locking in that limit. On the contrary, aggregated finite
element spaces are locking-free because they can be expressed as an extension
operator from well-posed to ill-posed degrees of freedom. Next, we propose
novel ghost penalty methods that penalise the distance between the solution and
its aggregation-based discrete extension. These methods are locking-free and
converge to aggregated finite element methods in the infinite penalty parameter
limit. We include an exhaustive set of numerical experiments in which we
compare weak (ghost penalty) and strong (aggregated finite elements) schemes in
terms of error quantities, condition numbers and sensitivity with respect to
penalty coefficients on different geometries, intersection locations and mesh
topologies.

useful information with a service provider to obtain some utility. The service
provider is adversarial in the sense that it can infer the users' private
information based on the shared useful information. To minimize the privacy
leakage while maintaining a desired level of utility, the users carefully
perturb the useful information via a probabilistic privacy mapping before
sharing it. We focus on the setting in which the adversary attempting an
inference attack on the users' privacy has potentially biased information about
the statistical correlation between the private and useful variables. This
information asymmetry between the users and the limited adversary leads to
better privacy guarantees than the case of the omniscient adversary under the
same utility requirement. We first identify assumptions on the adversary's
information so that the inference costs are well-defined and finite. Then, we
characterize the impact of the information asymmetry and show that it increases
the inference costs for the adversary. We further formulate the design of the
privacy mapping against a limited adversary using a difference of convex
functions program and solve it via the concave-convex procedure. When the
adversary's information is not precisely available, we adopt a Bayesian view
and represent the adversary's information by a probability distribution. In
this case, the expected cost for the adversary does not admit a closed-form
expression, and we establish and maximize a lower bound of the expected cost.
We provide a numerical example regarding a census data set to illustrate the
theoretical results.

particularly on illumination-variant datasets. To address this problem, we
propose a new CNN method based on orientation fusion for visual object
recognition. The proposed cloud-based video analytics system pioneers the use
of bi-dimensional empirical mode decomposition to split a video frame into
intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). We further propose these IMFs to endure Reisz
transform to produce monogenic object components, which are in turn used for
the training of CNNs. Past works have demonstrated how the object orientation
component may be used to pursue accuracy levels as high as 93\%. Herein we
demonstrate how a feature-fusion strategy of the orientation components leads
to further improving visual recognition accuracy to 97\%. We also assess the
scalability of our method, looking at both the number and the size of the video
streams under scrutiny. We carry out extensive experimentation on the publicly
available Yale dataset, including also a self generated video datasets, finding
significant improvements (both in accuracy and scale), in comparison to
AlexNet, LeNet and SE-ResNeXt, which are the three most commonly used deep
