computational approach. Examples for epoxy carbon fiber composite, metal matrix
composite, and aluminum foam illustrate the effectiveness and versatility of
the proposed method. The influences of volume fraction of matrix, the stack of
RVEs, and the varying unit cell lengths on the identified parameters are
investigated. The homogenization computational tool is applicable to a wide
class materials and makes use of open-source codes in FEniCS. We make all of
the codes publicly available in order to encourage a transparent scientific

coalescing sources are responsible for a first-order displacement memory effect
experienced by a pair of freely falling test masses. This constant displacement
is sourced from the non-vanishing final gravitational-wave strain present in
the wave's after-zone, often referred to as the non-linear memory effect, and
is of the same order of magnitude as the strain from the outgoing quadrupole
radiation. Hence, this prediction of general relativity is verifiable
experimentally by measurement of the final relative separation between test
masses that comprise gravitational-wave detectors. In a separate context,
independent calculations have demonstrated that exact, sandwich, plane wave
spacetimes exhibit a velocity memory effect: a non-zero relative velocity,
gained by a pair of test masses in free fall, after the passage of a
gravitational wave. In this paper, we find that in addition to the known
constant displacement memory effect test masses experience, a velocity memory
effect at leading order arises due to the non-linear nature of gravitational
waves from compact binary sources. We discuss the magnitude of the first-order
velocity memory effect in the context of observing gravitational-wave radiation
from super massive binary black hole mergers in LISA.

imbalance loss, which can be used for network clustering. Here, we propose
\textit{directed flow imbalance} measures, which are tightly related to
directionality, to reveal clusters in the network even when there is no density
difference between clusters. In contrast to standard approaches in the
literature, in this paper, directionality is not treated as a nuisance, but
rather contains the main signal. DIGRAC optimizes directed flow imbalance for
clustering without requiring label supervision, unlike existing graph neural
network methods, and can naturally incorporate node features, unlike existing
spectral methods. Extensive experimental results on synthetic data, in the form
of directed stochastic block models, and real-world data at different scales,
demonstrate that our method, based on flow imbalance, attains state-of-the-art
results on directed graph clustering when compared against 10 state-of-the-art
methods from the literature, for a wide range of noise and sparsity levels,
graph structures, and topologies, and even outperforms supervised methods.

test the accuracy of COLA simulations. At the level of Dark Matter (DM), we
show that COLA accurately reproduces the matter power spectrum up to $k \sim 1
h {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, while it is less accurate in reproducing the velocity field.
To produce halo catalogues, we find that the ROCKSTAR halo-finder does not
perform well with COLA simulations. On the other hand, using a simple
Friends-of-Friends (FoF) finder and an empirical mass conversion from FoF to
spherical over-density masses, we are able to produce halo catalogues in COLA
that are in good agreement with those in $N$-body simulations. To consider the
effects of the MG fifth force on the halo profile, we derive simple fitting
formulae for the concentration-mass and the velocity dispersion-mass relations
that we calibrate using ROCKSTAR halo catalogues in $N$-body simulations. We
then use these results to extend the HOD formalism to modified gravity
simulations in COLA. We use an HOD model with five parameters that we tune to
obtain galaxy catalogues in redshift space. We find that despite the great
freedom of the HOD model, MG leaves characteristic imprints in the redshift
space power spectrum multipoles and these features are well captured by the
COLA galaxy catalogues.

proposed by Seide et al (2014) as a heuristic, EF resisted any theoretical
understanding until recently [Stich et al., 2018, Alistarh et al., 2018].
However, all existing analyses either i) apply to the single node setting only,
ii) rely on very strong and often unreasonable assumptions, such global
boundedness of the gradients, or iterate-dependent assumptions that cannot be
checked a-priori and may not hold in practice, or iii) circumvent these issues
via the introduction of additional unbiased compressors, which increase the
communication cost. In this work we fix all these deficiencies by proposing and
analyzing a new EF mechanism, which we call EF21, which consistently and
substantially outperforms EF in practice. Our theoretical analysis relies on
standard assumptions only, works in the distributed heterogeneous data setting,
and leads to better and more meaningful rates. In particular, we prove that
EF21 enjoys a fast $O(1/T)$ convergence rate for smooth nonconvex problems,
beating the previous bound of $O(1/T^{2/3})$, which was shown a bounded
gradients assumption. We further improve this to a fast linear rate for PL
functions, which is the first linear convergence result for an EF-type method
not relying on unbiased compressors. Since EF has a large number of
applications where it reigns supreme, we believe that our 2021 variant, EF21,
can a large impact on the practice of communication efficient distributed

Hawking evaporation, different physical theories with the same black hole

internal absorption in visible wavelengths. However, the relation of the two
amounts is not trivial because optical absorption may saturate, but the FIR
emission does not. Moreover, the volume concentration of dust plays a role in
the relation of absorption and emission, which depends on the size of the
galaxy. We explore the relation of these three quantities. In order to
understand the geometrical problem, we developed a model of dust distribution.
We also investigated the relation of the three variables with real data of
spiral galaxies at z<0.2 using the spectroscopic SDSS and FIR AKARI surveys.
Internal absorptions were derived with two different methods: the ratio of
emission lines H$_\alpha $ and H$_\beta $, and a previously calibrated relation
based on the color variations as a function of absolute magnitude and
concentration index.
  We find that in our low-z sample, the dependence of the average internal
attenuation on galaxy size is negligible on average. It allows us to derive the
internal attenuation of the galaxy, $A_V$, even when we only know its FIR flux.
This attenuation approximately depends on the inclination of the galaxy $i$ as
$\overline {A_V}=\gamma_V \log _{10}\left(\frac{1}{\cos i}\right)$, where
$\gamma_V$ is a constant. We found that $\gamma_V$ has a maximum value of
$1.45\pm 0.27$ magnitudes.
  When similar properties of dust are assumed, a general expression can be used
at any $z$. For cases of nonsaturation, this might be used as a cosmological
test. Although the present-day sensitivity of FIR or mm surveys does not allow
us to carry out this cosmological test at z>2 within the standard model, it may
be used in the future. For much lower z or different cosmological models, a
test might be feasible at present.

leverage to gain a better understanding of the genetic basis of the human
genome and identify associations between phenotypes and specific parts of DNA.
However, sharing genomic datasets that include sensitive genetic or medical
information of individuals can lead to serious privacy-related consequences if
data lands in the wrong hands. Restricting access to genomic datasets is one
solution, but this greatly reduces their usefulness for research purposes. To
allow sharing of genomic datasets while addressing these privacy concerns,
several studies propose privacy-preserving mechanisms for data sharing.
Differential privacy (DP) is one of such mechanisms that formalize rigorous
mathematical foundations to provide privacy guarantees while sharing aggregated
statistical information about a dataset. However, it has been shown that the
original privacy guarantees of DP-based solutions degrade when there are
dependent tuples in the dataset, which is a common scenario for genomic
datasets (due to the existence of family members). Results: In this work, we
introduce a near-optimal mechanism to mitigate the vulnerabilities of the
inference attacks on differentially private query results from genomic datasets
including dependent tuples. We propose a utility-maximizing and
privacy-preserving approach for sharing statistics by hiding selective SNPs of
the family members as they participate in a genomic dataset. By evaluating our
mechanism on a real-world genomic dataset, we empirically demonstrate that our
proposed mechanism can achieve up to 40% better privacy than state-of-the-art
DP-based solutions, while near-optimally minimizing the utility loss.

  trafficking images",,,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Child trafficking in a serious problem around the world. Every year there are
more than 4 million victims of child trafficking around the world, many of them
for the purposes of child sexual exploitation. In collaboration with UK Police
and a non-profit focused on child abuse prevention, Global Emancipation
Network, we developed a proof-of-concept machine learning pipeline to aid the
identification of children from intercepted images. In this work, we focus on
images that contain children wearing school uniforms to identify the school of
origin. In the absence of a machine learning pipeline, this hugely time
consuming and labor intensive task is manually conducted by law enforcement
personnel. Thus, by automating aspects of the school identification process, we
hope to significantly impact the speed of this portion of child identification.
Our proposed pipeline consists of two machine learning models: i) to identify
whether an image of a child contains a school uniform in it, and ii)
identification of attributes of different school uniform items (such as
color/texture of shirts, sweaters, blazers etc.). We describe the data
collection, labeling, model development and validation process, along with
strategies for efficient searching of schools using the model predictions.

insulator Sm$_{1-x}$Gd$_{x}$B$_{6}$ by means of electron spin resonance (ESR)
of Gd$^{3+}$ ions at low temperatures. Our analysis reveals that the Gd$^{3+}$
ESR line shape shows an anomalous evolution as a function of temperature,
wherein for highly dilute samples (x $\approx$ 0.0002) the Gd$^{3+}$ ESR line
shape changes from a localized ESR local moment character to a diffusive-like
character. Upon manipulating the sample surface with a focused ion beam we
demonstrate, in combination with electrical resistivity measurements, that the
localized character of the Gd$^{3+}$ ESR line shape is recovered by increasing
the penetration of the microwave in the sample. This provides compelling
evidence for the contribution of surface or near-surface excitations to the
relaxation mechanism in the Gd$^{3+}$ spin dynamics. Our work brings new
insights into the importance of non-trivial surface excitations in ESR, opening
new routes to be explored both theoretically and experimentally.

Helmholtz equation, where the subdomain problems satisfy first-order absorbing
(impedance) transmission conditions, and exchange of information between
subdomains is achieved using a partition of unity. We provide a novel analysis
of this method at the PDE level (without discretization). First, we formulate
the method as a fixed point iteration, and show (in dimensions 1,2,3) that it
is well-defined in a tensor product of appropriate local function spaces, each
with $L^2$ impedance boundary data. Given this, we then obtain a bound on the
norm of the fixed point operator in terms of the local norms of certain
impedance-to-impedance maps arising from local interactions between subdomains.
These bounds provide conditions under which (some power of) the fixed point
operator is a contraction. In 2-d, for rectangular domains and strip-wise
domain decompositions (with each subdomain only overlapping its immediate
neighbours), we present two techniques for verifying the assumptions on the
impedance-to-impedance maps which ensure power contractivity of the fixed point
operator. The first is through semiclassical analysis, which gives rigorous
estimates valid as the frequency tends to infinity. These results verify the
required assumptions for sufficiently large overlap. For more realistic domain
decompositions, we directly compute the norms of the impedance-to-impedance
maps by solving certain canonical (local) eigenvalue problems. We give
numerical experiments that illustrate the theory. These also show that the
iterative method remains convergent and/or provides a good preconditioner in
cases not covered by the theory, including for general domain decompositions,
such as those obtained via automatic graph-partitioning software.

federated learning (FL) has emerged as a framework for model training without

spatio-temporal dependencies to improve forecasting capabilities still remains
an open problem. On the other hand, state-of-the-art spatio-temporal
forecasting models assume unfettered access to the data, neglecting constraints

model -- Cross-Node Federated Graph Neural Network (CNFGNN) -- which explicitly
encodes the underlying graph structure using graph neural network (GNN)-based
architecture under the constraint of cross-node federated learning, which
requires that data in a network of nodes is generated locally on each node and
remains decentralized. CNFGNN operates by disentangling the temporal dynamics
modeling on devices and spatial dynamics on the server, utilizing alternating
optimization to reduce the communication cost, facilitating computations on the
edge devices. Experiments on the traffic flow forecasting task show that CNFGNN
achieves the best forecasting performance in both transductive and inductive
learning settings with no extra computation cost on edge devices, while
incurring modest communication cost.

hydrogen comprise roughly one-third of the observed explosions of massive
stars. Their origin and the evolution of their progenitors are not yet fully
understood. Very massive single stars stripped by their own winds ($\gtrsim
25-30 M_{\odot}$ at solar metallicity) are considered viable progenitors of
these events. However, recent 1D core-collapse simulations show that some
massive stars may collapse directly into black holes after a failed explosion,
with a weak or no visible transient. In this letter, we estimate the effect of
direct collapse into a black hole on the rates of stripped-envelope supernovae
that arise from single stars. For this, we compute single-star MESA models at
solar metallicity and map their final state to their core-collapse outcome
following prescriptions commonly used in population synthesis. According to our
models, no single stars that have lost their entire hydrogen-rich envelope are
able to explode, and only a fraction of progenitors left with a thin hydrogen
envelope do (IIb progenitor candidates), unless we use a prescription that
takes the effect of turbulence into account or invoke increased wind mass-loss
rates. This result increases the existing tension between the single-star
paradigm to explain most stripped-envelope supernovae and their observed rates
and properties. At face value, our results point toward an even higher
contribution of binary progenitors to stripped-envelope supernovae.
Alternatively, they may suggest inconsistencies in the common practice of
mapping different stellar models to core-collapse outcomes and/or higher
overall mass loss in massive stars.

Einstein-like models to calculated spectra of polyhydrides, as well as
numerical solutions of the Eliashberg equations, we derive a formula for $T_c$
that performs as well as Allen-Dynes for low-$T_c$ superconductors, and
substantially better for higher-$T_c$ ones. The expression identified through
our data-driven approach corrects the systematic underestimation of $T_c$ while
reproducing the physical constraints originally outlined by Allen and Dynes.
This equation should replace the Allen-Dynes formula for the prediction of
higher-temperature superconductors and for the estimation of $\lambda$ from
experimental data.

by remotely controlling the start and stop of the mowing system. Alternatively,
it also serves the purpose of maintaining lawns and sports field made of grass.
The same system can be used for water spraying and mowing the grass to desired

move at 1.4m/s, with an effective spraying area of 0.98 sq. m. by the nozzle

linear representations -- for example principal components analysis (PCA), or
linear independent components analysis (ICA) -- come with guarantees that they
will always reveal the same latent representations (perhaps up to an arbitrary
rotation or permutation). Unfortunately, for non-linear representation
learning, such as in a variational auto-encoder (VAE) model trained by
stochastic gradient descent, we have no such guarantees. Recent work on
identifiability in non-linear ICA have introduced a family of deep generative
models that have identifiable latent representations, achieved by conditioning
on side information (e.g. informative labels). We empirically evaluate the
stability of these models under repeated re-estimation of parameters, and
compare them to both standard VAEs and deep generative models which learn to
cluster in their latent space. Surprisingly, we discover side information is
not necessary for algorithmic stability: using standard quantitative measures
of identifiability, we find deep generative models with latent clusterings are
empirically identifiable to the same degree as models which rely on auxiliary
labels. We relate these results to the possibility of identifiable non-linear
ICA.

look nearly indistinguishable from the data on which they are trained. This
raises the question: if we have good enough generative models, do we still need
datasets? We investigate this question in the setting of learning
general-purpose visual representations from a black-box generative model rather
than directly from data. Given an off-the-shelf image generator without any
access to its training data, we train representations from the samples output
by this generator. We compare several representation learning methods that can
be applied to this setting, using the latent space of the generator to generate
multiple ""views"" of the same semantic content. We show that for contrastive
methods, this multiview data can naturally be used to identify positive pairs
(nearby in latent space) and negative pairs (far apart in latent space). We
find that the resulting representations rival or even outperform those learned
directly from real data, but that good performance requires care in the
sampling strategy applied and the training method. Generative models can be
viewed as a compressed and organized copy of a dataset, and we envision a
future where more and more ""model zoos"" proliferate while datasets become
increasingly unwieldy, missing, or private. This paper suggests several
techniques for dealing with visual representation learning in such a future.

vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks. The attackers holding a specially
crafted patch can hide themselves from the state-of-the-art person detectors,
e.g., YOLO, even in the physical world. This kind of attack can bring serious
security threats, such as escaping from surveillance cameras. In this paper, we
deeply explore the detection problems about the adversarial patch attacks to
the object detection. First, we identify a leverageable signature of existing
adversarial patches from the point of the visualization explanation. A fast
signature-based defense method is proposed and demonstrated to be effective.
Second, we design an improved patch generation algorithm to reveal the risk
that the signature-based way may be bypassed by the techniques emerging in the
future. The newly generated adversarial patches can successfully evade the
proposed signature-based defense. Finally, we present a novel
signature-independent detection method based on the internal content semantics
consistency rather than any attack-specific prior knowledge. The fundamental
intuition is that the adversarial object can appear locally but disappear
globally in an input image. The experiments demonstrate that the
signature-independent method can effectively detect the existing and improved
attacks. It has also proven to be a general method by detecting unforeseen and
even other types of attacks without any attack-specific prior knowledge. The
two proposed detection methods can be adopted in different scenarios, and we
believe that combining them can offer a comprehensive protection.

purely reactive fashion, where an appropriate action is selected based on an

execute new decisions. This makes learning inefficient, especially in
environments that need various degrees of fine and coarse control. To address
this, we propose a proactive setting in which the agent not only selects an
action in a state but also for how long to commit to that action. Our TempoRL

constructed on the cubic lattice by Burnell-Chen-Fidkowski-Vishwanath. Other
examples include the double-semion model, and also the `fermionic' toric code
in arbitrary dimensions on hypercubic lattices. In addition, we extend previous
constructions of exact boson-fermion dualities and the Gu-Wen Grassmann
Integral to arbitrary dimensions. Another result which may be of independent
interest is a derivation of a cochain-level action for the generalized
double-semion model, reproducing a recently derived action on the cohomology
level.

data supported on an unknown low-dimensional manifold, a common occurrence in
real-world domains such as image data. Recent attempts to remedy this
limitation have introduced geometric complications that defeat a central
benefit of normalizing flows: exact density estimation. We recover this benefit
with Conformal Embedding Flows, a framework for designing flows that learn
manifolds with tractable densities. We argue that composing a standard flow
with a trainable conformal embedding is the most natural way to model
manifold-supported data. To this end, we present a series of conformal building
blocks and apply them in experiments with synthetic and real-world data to
demonstrate that flows can model manifold-supported distributions without

of massive impacts that concluded the process of terrestrial planet formation.
Following their formation, the giant planets' orbits evolved through an episode
of dynamical instability. Several qualities of the solar system have recently
been interpreted as evidence of this event transpiring within the first ~100
Myr after the Sun's birth; around the same time as the final assembly of the
inner planets. In a series of recent papers we argued that such an early
instability could resolve several problems revealed in classic numerical
studies of terrestrial planet formation; namely the small masses of Mars and
the asteroid belt. In this paper, we revisit the early instability scenario
with a large suite of simulations specifically designed to understand the
degree to which Earth and Mars' formation are sensitive to the specific
evolution of Jupiter and Saturn's orbits. By deriving our initial terrestrial
disks directly from recent high-resolution simulations of planetesimal
accretion, our results largely confirm our previous findings regarding the
instability's efficiency of truncating the terrestrial disk outside of the
Earth-forming region in simulations that best replicate the outer solar system.
Moreover, our work validates the primordial 2:1 Jupiter-Saturn resonance within
the early instability framework as a viable evolutionary path for the solar
system. While our simulations elucidate the fragility of the terrestrial system
during the epoch of giant planet migration, many realizations yield outstanding
solar system analogs when scrutinized against a number of observational
constraints. Finally, we highlight the inability of models to form adequate
Mercury-analogs and the low eccentricities of Earth and Venus as the most
significant outstanding problems for future numerical studies to resolve.

previously been reported as showing evidence for suppressed star formation

traced with [O~{\sc iii}] emission. Here we combine the ALMA observations with
a re-analysis of the VLT/SINFONI data to map the rest-frame far-infrared

observe high velocity [O~{\sc iii}] gas (i.e.,
W80$\sim$1000--2000\,km\,s$^{-1}$) across the whole galaxy. We do not identify
any H$\alpha$ emission that is free from contamination from AGN-related
processes; however, based on SED analyses, we show that the ALMA data contains
a significant dust-obscured star formation component in two out of the three
systems. This dust emission is found to be extended over $\approx$1.5--5.5\,kpc
in the nuclear regions, overlaps with the previously reported H$\alpha$
cavities and is co-spatial with the peak in surface brightness of the [O~{\sc
iii}] outflows. In summary, within the resolution and sensitivity limits of the
data, we do not see any evidence for a instantaneous shut down of in-situ star
formation caused directly by the outflows. However, similar to the conclusions
of previous studies and based on our measured star formation rates, we do not
rule out that the global host galaxy star formation could be suppressed on
longer timescales by the cumulative effect of quasar episodes during the growth
of these massive black holes.

that a combination of SDI and ADI consistently achieves better results than ADI

CODI) achieved the best results. The integration time test shows that targets
with a separation larger than 0.24 arcsec observed with an integration time of
more than 10$^3$s were photon-noise limited. Field rotation shows a strong
correlation with S/N for field rotations up to 1 full width at half maximum

observed. Wavelength range variation shows a general increase in S/N for
broader wavelength ranges, but no clear correlation is seen. Spectral

time-dependent variational principle in uniform martrix product states, we
calculate the time evolution of the local order parameter and Loschmidt return
rate in transverse-field Ising chains with antiferromagnetic power law-decaying

\textit{Anomalous} cusps in the return rate, which are ubiquitous at small
quenches within the ordered phase in the case of ferromagnetic long-range

the antiferromagnetic case, showing that long-range interactions are not a
sufficient condition for their appearance. We attribute this to much weaker
domain-wall binding in the antiferromagnetic case. For quenches across the
quantum critical point, \textit{regular} cusps appear in the return rate and
connect to the local order parameter changing sign, indicating the concurrence
of two major concepts of dynamical phase transitions. Our results consolidate
conclusions of previous works that a necessary condition for the appearance of
anomalous cusps in the return rate after quenches within the ordered phase is
for topologically trivial local spin flips to be the energetically dominant

in addition to their fluxes and positions allows us to measure both the

that the LSBG samples are well-characterized by oblate spheroids, with no
significant difference between red and blue LSBGs. This inferred shape
distribution is in good agreement with similar inferences made for
ultra-diffuse cluster galaxy samples, indicating that environment does not play
a key role in determining the intrinsic shape of low surface brightness
galaxies. We also find some evidence that LSBGs are more thickened than
similarly massive high surface brightness dwarfs. We compare our results to
intrinsic shape measures from contemporary cosmological simulations, and find
that the observed LSBG intrinsic shapes place considerable constraints on the
formation path of such galaxies. In particular, LSBG production via the

the presence of a remnant discrete symmetry: dark CP. We study and compare the

non-resonant Higgs-mediated annihilations. In some cases, combining different

thus spoiling the stability of the dark matter candidate. Requiring that this

the quantum oscillations in metals. At first glance, these observations are
consistent with the presence of the long-sought-after spinon Fermi surface
state. Strikingly, however, the experiment also reported vanishing thermal Hall
conductivity coexisting with the oscillations of the longitudinal one. Such
absence of the thermal Hall effect must originate from crystalline symmetries
of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. But if the system was a traditional spinon fermi surface

magnetic field acting on the spinons, in stark contradiction with the presence
of quantum oscillations in experiments. To reconcile these observations, we
introduce a new class of symmetry enriched ``pseudoscalar"" U(1) spin liquids in
which certain crystalline symmetries act as a particle-hole conjugation on the
spinons. The associated pseudoscalar spinon Fermi surface states allow for the
coexistence of an emergent Landau quantizing magnetic field while having an
exactly zero thermal Hall conductivity. We develop a general theory of these
states by constructing Gutzwiller-projected wave-functions and describing how
they naturally appear as U(1) spin liquids with a distinctive projective
symmetry group implementation of crystalline symmetries in the fermionic parton
representation of spins. We propose that the field induced quantum disordered
state in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ descends from a pseudoscalar spinon fermi surface
state that features compensated spinon-particle and spinon-hole pockets
possibly located around the $M$ points of its honeycomb Brillouin zone. These
points are connected via a wave-vector associated with the emergence of the
competing zig-zag antiferromagnetic state.

RSD/WL joint analyses in a lossless way. RSD is typically measured in $3D$
redshift space, but WL is inherently a projected signal, making angular
statistics a natural choice for the combined analysis. Thus, we determine the

Specifically we perform a Fisher analysis to forecast constraints and model
bias comparing two different Fingers-of-God (FoG) models using both, the $3D$

na\""ive tomographic projection mixes large scales with poorly modelled

true even in the limit of narrow tomographic bins. In light of this we propose
a new radial weighting scheme which unmixes radial RSD scales in projection
yielding competitive constraints to the $3D$ RSD power spectrum, while keeping
the model bias small. This work lays the groundwork for optimal joint analyses

particularly relevant because the singularities of correlators are not directly
observable, but can only be accessed by analytic continuation. In this paper,
we study rational correlators, including those of gauge fields, gravitons, and
the inflaton, whose only singularities at tree level are poles and whose
behavior away from these poles is strongly constrained by unitarity and
locality. We describe how unitarity translates into a set of cutting rules that
consistent correlators must satisfy, and explain how this can be used to
bootstrap correlators given information about their singularities. We also
derive recursion relations that allow the iterative construction of more
complicated correlators from simpler building blocks. In flat space, all energy
singularities are simple poles, so that the combination of unitarity
constraints and recursion relations provides an efficient way to bootstrap the
full correlators. In many cases, these flat-space correlators can then be
transformed into their more complex de Sitter counterparts. As an example of
this procedure, we derive the correlator associated to graviton Compton
scattering in de Sitter space, though the methods are much more widely

time-translation symmetric dynamics, where the Lindblad jump operators

The formalism is illustrated by three exactly solvable non-Markovian models,

Minimum flux occurred in April 2012 and the total event duration was a few

Lensing Experiment and VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea surveys show a
remarkably achromatic event. During 17 years of observational coverage of this
source only one such event was detected. The physical properties of the giant
star itself appear somewhat unusual, which may ultimately provide a clue
towards the nature of the system. By modelling the event as an occultation by
an object that is elliptical in projection with uniform transparency, we place
limits on its physical size and velocity. We find that the occultation is
unlikely to be due to a chance alignment with a foreground object. We consider
a number of possible candidates for the occulter, which must be optically thick
and possess a radius or thickness in excess of 0.25 au. None are completely
satisfactory matches to all the data. The duration, depth and relative
achromaticity of the dip mark this out as an exceptionally unusual event, whose
secret has still not been fully revealed. We find two further candidates in the

make the large momentum expansion of the equal-time Euclidean correlation

systems in a distributed manner. Such problems are motivated by the recent
swarm control technique that uses mean-field approximations to represent the
collective effect of the swarm, wherein the mean-field density (especially its
gradient) is usually used in feedback control design. In the first part, we
formulate the density estimation problem as a filtering problem of the
associated mean-field partial differential equation (PDE), for which we employ
kernel density estimation (KDE) to construct noisy observations and use
filtering theory of PDE systems to design an optimal (centralized) density
filter. It turns out that the covariance operator of observation noise depends
on the unknown density. Hence, we use approximations for the covariance
operator to obtain a suboptimal density filter, and prove that both the density
estimates and their gradient are convergent and remain close to the optimal one
using the notion of input-to-state stability (ISS). In the second part, we
continue to study how to decentralize the density filter such that each agent
can estimate the mean-field density based on only its own position and local
information exchange with neighbors. We prove that the local density filter is
also convergent and remains close to the centralized one in the sense of ISS.
Simulation results suggest that the centralized suboptimal density filter is
able to generate convergent density estimates, and the local density filter is
able to converge and remain close to the centralized filter.

tasks given not just limited supervision but limited data as well. An
attractive solution is synthetic data generation. However, most such methods
are overly sophisticated, focusing on high-quality, realistic data in the input
space. It is unclear whether adapting them to the few-shot regime and using
them for the downstream task of classification is the right approach. Previous
works on synthetic data generation for few-shot classification focus on
exploiting complex models, e.g. a Wasserstein GAN with multiple regularizers or
a network that transfers latent diversities from known to novel classes.
  We follow a different approach and investigate how a simple and
straightforward synthetic data generation method can be used effectively. We
make two contributions, namely we show that: (1) using a simple loss function
is more than enough for training a feature generator in the few-shot setting;
and (2) learning to generate tensor features instead of vector features is
superior. Extensive experiments on miniImagenet, CUB and CIFAR-FS datasets show
that our method sets a new state of the art, outperforming more sophisticated

Likelihood ratio (LR) to explain the impact of evidence . The LR measures the
probative value of the evidence with respect to a single hypothesis such as
'DNA comes from the suspect', and is defined as the probability of the evidence
if the hypothesis is true divided by the probability of the evidence if the
hypothesis is false. The LR is a valid measure of probative value because, by
Bayes Theorem, the higher the LR is, the more our belief in the probability the
hypothesis is true increases after observing the evidence. The LR is popular
because it measures the probative value of evidence without having to make any
explicit assumptions about the prior probability of the hypothesis. However,
whereas the LR can in principle be easily calculated for a distinct single
piece of evidence that relates directly to a specific hypothesis, in most
realistic situations 'the evidence' is made up of multiple dependent components
that impact multiple different hypotheses. In such situations the LR cannot be
calculated . However, once the multiple pieces of evidence and hypotheses are
modelled as a causal Bayesian network (BN), any relevant LR can be
automatically derived using any BN software application.

by the molecular material on the polariton assisted emission both for a focused
laser beam and for normally incident excitation, for two different excitation
wavelengths: a laser in resonance with the lower polariton branch, and a laser
not in resonance. We found that the Raman scattered photons play an important
role in populating the lower polariton branch, especially when the system was
excited with a laser in resonance with the lower polariton branch. We also
found that the polariton assisted photoemission depends on the extent of
modification of the molecular absorption induced by the molecule-cavity

results show that it can be less likely to identify the ground states when
temperature decreases, due to trapping in individual local minima, which ceases
at different time, leading to multiple abrupt jumps with time in the
ground-state probability. Simulations agree well with theoretical predictions
on these remarkable phenomena. Finally, for large systems, we introduce a
variant approach to extract partially the energy landscapes and observe both
analytically and in simulations similar phenomena. This work introduces new
methodology to unravel the non-equilibrium dynamics of glassy systems, and

incrementally on different tasks. Popular incremental learning methods mitigate
such forgetting by retaining a subset of previously seen samples and replaying
them during the training on subsequent tasks. However, this is not always
possible, e.g., due to data protection regulations. In such restricted
scenarios, one can employ generative models to replay either artificial images
or hidden features to a classifier. In this work, we propose Genifer
(GENeratIve FEature-driven image Replay), where a generative model is trained
to replay images that must induce the same hidden features as real samples when
they are passed through the classifier. Our technique therefore incorporates
the benefits of both image and feature replay, i.e.: (1) unlike conventional
image replay, our generative model explicitly learns the distribution of
features that are relevant for classification; (2) in contrast to feature
replay, our entire classifier remains trainable; and (3) we can leverage
image-space augmentations, which increase distillation performance while also
mitigating overfitting during the training of the generative model. We show
that Genifer substantially outperforms the previous state of the art for
various settings on the CIFAR-100 and CUB-200 datasets.

nonlinear multi-agent systems (MAS) subject to parametric uncertainties,

self-triggered min-max distributed model predictive control (DMPC) approach is
proposed to handle these practical issues. At triggering instants, each agent
solves a local min-max optimization problem based on local system states and
predicted system states of neighbors, determines its next triggering instant
and broadcasts its predicted state trajectory to its neighbors. As a result,
the communication load is greatly alleviated while retaining robustness and
comparable control performance compared to periodic algorithms. In order to
handle time-varying delays, a novel consistency constraint is incorporated into
each local optimization problem to restrict the deviation between the newest
predicted states and previously broadcast predicted states. Consequently, each
agent can utilize previously predicted states of its neighbors to achieve
cooperation in the presence of time-varying delays and asynchronous
communication induced by the distributed triggered scheduler. The recursive
feasibility of the proposed algorithm and the closed-loop stability of MAS at

to the secular evolution and dispersal of protoplanetary discs heated by high

models of self-similar thermal winds - which have self-consistent morphology
and variation of flow variables - to the case of launch from an elevated base
and to non-isothermal conditions. These solutions are well-reproduced by
hydrodynamic simulations, in which, as in the case of isothermal winds launched
from the mid-plane, we find winds launch at the maximum Mach number for which
the streamline solutions extend to infinity without encountering a singularity.
We explain this behaviour based on the fact that lower Mach number solutions do
not fill the spatial domain. We also show that hydrodynamic simulations reflect
the corresponding self-similar models across a range of conditions appropriate
to photoevaporating protoplanetary discs, even when gravity, centrifugal
forces, or changes in the density gradient mean the problem is not inherently
scale free. Of all the parameters varied, the elevation of the wind base
affected the launch velocity and flow morphology most strongly, with
temperature gradients causing only minor differences. We explore how launching
from an elevated base affects Ne II line profiles from winds, finding it
increases (reduces) the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the line at low
(high) inclination to the line of sight compared with models launched from the
disc mid-plane and thus weakens the dependence of the FWHM on inclination.

as easily reparametrized. We here propose to use the Fisher-Rao metric
associated with the space of decoder distributions as a reference metric, which
we pull back to the latent space. We show that we can achieve meaningful latent
geometries for a wide range of decoder distributions for which the previous
theory was not applicable, opening the door to `black box' latent geometries.

are embedded. Yet ideal notions of dimension, as in Euclidean spaces, do not
always translate to physical spaces, which can be constrained by boundaries and
distorted by inhomogeneities, or to intrinsically discrete systems such as
networks. To take into account locality, finiteness and discreteness, dynamical
processes can be used to probe the space geometry and define its dimension.
Here we show that each point in space can be assigned a relative dimension with
respect to the source of a diffusive process, a concept that provides a
scale-dependent definition for local and global dimension also applicable to
networks. To showcase its application to physical systems, we demonstrate that
the local dimension of structural protein graphs correlates with structural
flexibility, and the relative dimension with respect to the active site
uncovers regions involved in allosteric communication. In simple models of
epidemics on networks, the relative dimension is predictive of the spreading
capability of nodes, and identifies scales at which the graph structure is
predictive of infectivity. We further apply our dimension measures to neuronal
networks, economic trade, social networks, ocean flows, and to the comparison
of random graphs.

speculate that sustained systemic immune activation seen with SARS-CoV-2 may
also cause secondary autoimmune activation in the CNS. Patients with chronic

the impact of COVID-19 on people with chronic neurological diseases and

of the quasar lies at about twice that of the cluster's inferred Einstein

problem known as Catastrophic Forgetting (CF). This happens when the weights of
a network are overwritten during the training of a new task causing forgetting
of old information. To address this issue, we propose MetA Reusable Knowledge
or MARK, a new method that fosters weight reusability instead of overwriting

among tasks. We envision these shared weights as a common Knowledge Base (KB)
that is not only used to learn new tasks, but also enriched with new knowledge
as the model learns new tasks. Key components behind MARK are two-fold. On the
one hand, a metalearning approach provides the key mechanism to incrementally
enrich the KB with new knowledge and to foster weight reusability among tasks.
On the other hand, a set of trainable masks provides the key mechanism to
selectively choose from the KB relevant weights to solve each task. By using
MARK, we achieve state of the art results in several popular benchmarks,
surpassing the best performing methods in terms of average accuracy by over 10%

the sample. The distributions of root-mean-square variability amplitudes are
strongly skewed toward small values, peaking at ~0.1 mag with tails stretching

largest for the reddest y band. A small ""brighter-redder"" effect is present,

for binary feature matrices influenced by pairwise similarity information.
Binary feature matrices are used in Bayesian models to uncover latent variables

a popular exchangeable prior distribution for latent feature matrices. In the
presence of additional information, however, the exchangeability assumption is
not reasonable or desirable. The AIBD can incorporate pairwise similarity
information, yet it preserves many properties of the IBP, including the
distribution of the total number of features. Thus, much of the interpretation
and intuition that one has for the IBP directly carries over to the AIBD. A
temperature parameter controls the degree to which the similarity information
affects feature-sharing between observations. Unlike other nonexchangeable
distributions for feature allocations, the probability mass function of the
AIBD has a tractable normalizing constant, making posterior inference on
hyperparameters straight-forward using standard MCMC methods. A novel posterior
sampling algorithm is proposed for the IBP and the AIBD. We demonstrate the

fundamental challenge in many real-world applications. Early exit methods
strive towards this goal by attaching additional Internal Classifiers (ICs) to
intermediate layers of a neural network. ICs can quickly return predictions for
easy examples and, as a result, reduce the average inference time of the whole
model. However, if a particular IC does not decide to return an answer early,
its predictions are discarded, with its computations effectively being wasted.
To solve this issue, we introduce Zero Time Waste (ZTW), a novel approach in
which each IC reuses predictions returned by its predecessors by (1) adding
direct connections between ICs and (2) combining previous outputs in an
ensemble-like manner. We conduct extensive experiments across various datasets

  Detection","10 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Semi-supervised anomaly detection aims to detect anomalies from normal
samples using a model that is trained on normal data. With recent advancements
in deep learning, researchers have designed efficient deep anomaly detection
methods. Existing works commonly use neural networks to map the data into a
more informative representation and then apply an anomaly detection algorithm.
In this paper, we propose a method, DASVDD, that jointly learns the parameters
of an autoencoder while minimizing the volume of an enclosing hyper-sphere on
its latent representation. We propose an anomaly score which is a combination
of autoencoder's reconstruction error and the distance from the center of the
enclosing hypersphere in the latent representation. Minimizing this anomaly
score aids us in learning the underlying distribution of the normal class
during training. Including the reconstruction error in the anomaly score
ensures that DASVDD does not suffer from the common hypersphere collapse issue
since the DASVDD model does not converge to the trivial solution of mapping all
inputs to a constant point in the latent representation. Experimental
evaluations on several benchmark datasets show that the proposed method
outperforms the commonly used state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms
while maintaining robust performance across different anomaly classes.

quasiparticle picture is robust up to far above the Fermi energy. We find,
however, that the quasiparticle picture becomes fragile in a small discrete

vanishing renormalization factor. We show that such a non-Fermi liquid behavior
arises due to the coupling of quasiparticles with the collective plasmon mode.

completely breaks down since only bosonic collective excitations exist, and
three-dimensional electron gas, where quasiparticles are well-defined and more

adapting an encoder-decoder transfer learning method from computer vision to
investigate the structure among 100 different feature spaces extracted from
hidden representations of various networks trained on language tasks. This
method reveals a low-dimensional structure where language models and
translation models smoothly interpolate between word embeddings, syntactic and
semantic tasks, and future word embeddings. We call this low-dimensional
structure a language representation embedding because it encodes the
relationships between representations needed to process language for a variety
of NLP tasks. We find that this representation embedding can predict how well
each individual feature space maps to human brain responses to natural language
stimuli recorded using fMRI. Additionally, we find that the principal dimension
of this structure can be used to create a metric which highlights the brain's
natural language processing hierarchy. This suggests that the embedding
captures some part of the brain's natural language representation structure.

crucial for efficient observation compression approaches in data assimilation
of large-scale dynamical problems. We propose a new combination of a covariance
tuning algorithm with existing PCA-type data compression approaches, either
observation- or information-based, with the aim of reducing the computational
cost of real-time updating at each assimilation step. Relying on a local
assumption of flow-independent error covariances, dynamical assimilation
residuals are used to adjust the covariance in each assimilation window. The
estimated covariances then contribute to better specify the principal
components of either the observation dynamics or the state-observation
sensitivity. The proposed approaches are first validated on a shallow water
twin experiment with correlated and non-homogeneous observation error. Proper
selection of flow-independent assimilation windows, together with sampling
density for background error estimation, and sensitivity of the approaches to
the observations error covariance knowledge, are also discussed and illustrated
with various numerical tests and results. The method is then applied to a more
challenging industrial hydrological model with real-world data and a non-linear
transformation operator provided by an operational precipitation-flow

scalar data grids and is commonly employed for scientific and medical image
data. Direct Volume Rendering (DVR) is a well established and efficient
rendering algorithm for volumetric data. Neural rendering uses deep neural
networks to solve inverse rendering tasks and applies techniques similar to
DVR. However, it has not been demonstrated successfully for the rendering of
scientific volume data.
  In this work, we introduce Deep Direct Volume Rendering (DeepDVR), a
generalization of DVR that allows for the integration of deep neural networks
into the DVR algorithm. We conceptualize the rendering in a latent color space,
thus enabling the use of deep architectures to learn implicit mappings for
feature extraction and classification, replacing explicit feature design and
hand-crafted transfer functions. Our generalization serves to derive novel
volume rendering architectures that can be trained end-to-end directly from
examples in image space, obviating the need to manually define and fine-tune
multidimensional transfer functions while providing superior classification
strength. We further introduce a novel stepsize annealing scheme to accelerate
the training of DeepDVR models and validate its effectiveness in a set of
experiments. We validate our architectures on two example use cases: (1)
learning an optimized rendering from manually adjusted reference images for a
single volume and (2) learning advanced visualization concepts like shading and
semantic colorization that generalize to unseen volume data.
  We find that deep volume rendering architectures with explicit modeling of
the DVR pipeline effectively enable end-to-end learning of scientific volume
rendering tasks from target images.

factors, including climate change, e-mobility, electric heating, and electric

empirical risk minimization (ERM) problems defined over a large dataset.
Traditional deterministic and stochastic quasi-Newton methods can be executed
to solve such problems; however, it is known that their global convergence rate
may not be better than first-order methods, and their local superlinear
convergence only appears towards the end of the learning process. In this
paper, we use an adaptive sample size scheme that exploits the superlinear
convergence of quasi-Newton methods globally and throughout the entire learning
process. The main idea of the proposed adaptive sample size algorithms is to
start with a small subset of data points and solve their corresponding ERM
problem within its statistical accuracy, and then enlarge the sample size
geometrically and use the optimal solution of the problem corresponding to the
smaller set as an initial point for solving the subsequent ERM problem with
more samples. We show that if the initial sample size is sufficiently large and

physically allowed, the analogous bound in medium can be exceeded by a moving

photons which is usually referred to as Cherenkov radiation. In this article a
related mathematical system for waves in inhomogeneous anisotropic medium with
a maximum of three polarisation directions is studied. The waves are assumed to
satisfy $P^k_j u_k (x,t) = S_j(x,t)$, where $P$ is a vector-valued wave
operator that depends on a Riemannian metric and $S $ is a point source that
moves at speed $\beta < c$ in given direction $\theta \in \mathbb{S}^2$. The
phase velocity $v_{\text{phase}}$ is described by the metric and depends on
both location and direction of motion. In regions where
$v_{\text{phase}}(x,\theta) < \beta <c $ holds the source generates a
cone-shaped front of singularities that propagate according to the underlying
geometry. We introduce a model for a measurement setup that applies the
mechanism and show that the Riemannian metric inside a bounded region can be
reconstructed from partial boundary measurements. The result suggests that
Cherenkov type radiation can be applied to detect internal geometric properties
of an inhomogeneous anisotropic target from a distance.

properties of the 3D toric code and the X-cube fracton model. The model, made
of Z_3 degrees of freedom at the links, has the vertex, the cube, and the
plaquette terms. Being a stabilizer code the ground states are exactly solved.
With only the vertex and the cube terms present, we show that the ground state
degeneracy (GSD) is 3^(L3+3L-1) where L is the linear dimension of the cubic
lattice. In addition to fractons, there are free vertex excitations we call the
freeons. With the addition of the plaquette terms, GSD is vastly reduced to
3^3, with fracton, fluxon, and freeon excitations, among which only the freeons
are deconfined. The model is called the AB model if only the vertex (A_v) and
the cube (B_c) terms are present, and the ABC model if in addition the
plaquette terms (C_p) are included. The AC model consisting of vertex and
plaquette terms is the Z_3 3D toric code. The extensive GSD of the AB model
derives from the existence of both local and non-local logical operators that
connect different ground states. The latter operators are identical to the
logical operators of the Z_3 X-cube model. Fracton excitations are immobile and
accompanied by the creation of fluxons - plaquettes having nonzero flux. In the
ABC model, such fluxon creation costs energy and ends up confining the
fractons. Unlike past models of fractons, vertex excitations are free to move
in any direction and pick up a non-trivial statistical phase when passing
through a fluxon or a fracton cluster.

adversarial defense techniques have been proposed to mitigate the interference
of adversarial noise, among which the input pre-processing methods are scalable
and show great potential to safeguard DNNs. However, pre-processing methods may
suffer from the robustness degradation effect, in which the defense reduces
rather than improving the adversarial robustness of a target model in a
white-box setting. A potential cause of this negative effect is that
adversarial training examples are static and independent to the pre-processing
model. To solve this problem, we investigate the influence of full adversarial
examples which are crafted against the full model, and find they indeed have a
positive impact on the robustness of defenses. Furthermore, we find that simply
changing the adversarial training examples in pre-processing methods does not
completely alleviate the robustness degradation effect. This is due to the
adversarial risk of the pre-processed model being neglected, which is another
cause of the robustness degradation effect. Motivated by above analyses, we
propose a method called Joint Adversarial Training based Pre-processing (JATP)
defense. Specifically, we formulate a feature similarity based adversarial risk
for the pre-processing model by using full adversarial examples found in a
feature space. Unlike standard adversarial training, we only update the
pre-processing model, which prompts us to introduce a pixel-wise loss to
improve its cross-model transferability. We then conduct a joint adversarial
training on the pre-processing model to minimize this overall risk. Empirical
results show that our method could effectively mitigate the robustness
degradation effect across different target models in comparison to previous
state-of-the-art approaches.

the cluster slave-spin Hamiltonian -- the antiferromagnetism at small $U$ is
due to the potential energy gain while that in the strong coupling limit is
driven by the kinetic energy gain, which is consistent with the results from
the cluster dynamical mean-field theory calculation and the quantum Monte Carlo
simulation. We find the interaction $U_{c}$ for the crossover in the AFM state,
separating the weak- and strong- coupling regimes, almost remains unchanged

$U_{\text{Mott}}$ for the first-order metal-insulator Mott transition in the

These two angles are calculated from key anatomical landmarks and structures of

usually requires a thorough understanding of complex anatomical structures. In
this study, we propose a multi-task framework to learn the relationships among
landmarks and structures jointly and automatically evaluate DDH. Our multi-task
networks are equipped with three novel modules. Firstly, we adopt Mask R-CNN as
the basic framework to detect and segment key anatomical structures and add one
landmark detection branch to form a new multi-task framework. Secondly, we
propose a novel shape similarity loss to refine the incomplete anatomical
structure prediction robustly and accurately. Thirdly, we further incorporate
the landmark-structure consistent prior to ensure the consistency of the bony
rim estimated from the segmented structure and the detected landmark. In our
experiments, 1,231 US images of the infant hip from 632 patients are collected,
of which 247 images from 126 patients are tested. The average errors in alpha

respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can

these phenomena by investigating how the modes, or local maxima, of a

newly proposed mode recovery cost. We design a tractable testbed where we build
three types of ground-truth distributions: (1) an LSTM based structured
distribution, (2) an unstructured distribution where probability of a sequence
does not depend on its content, and (3) a product of these two which we call a
semi-structured distribution. Our study reveals both expected and unexpected
findings. First, starting with data collection, mode recovery cost strongly
relies on the ground-truth distribution and is most costly with the
semi-structured distribution. Second, after learning, mode recovery cost from
the ground-truth distribution may increase or decrease compared to data
collection, with the largest cost degradation occurring with the
semi-structured ground-truth distribution. Finally, the ability of the
decoding-induced distribution to recover modes from the learned distribution is
highly impacted by the choices made earlier in the learning chain. We conclude
that future research must consider the entire learning chain in order to fully

Stone-Wales defect in the low energy range enhance electroluminescence
significantly while they reduce thermal radiation under zero bias. The
influence of the diameters of the CNTs with defects on the radiation is

the computational capacity of programmable switches is limited to simple
integer arithmetic operations while many of applications require on-the-fly
floating-point operations. To address this issue, prior approaches either adopt
a float-to-integer method or directly offload computational tasks to the local
CPUs of switches, incurring accuracy loss and delayed processing. To this end,
we propose NetFC, a table-lookup method to achieve on-the-fly in-network
floating-point arithmetic operations nearly without accuracy loss. NetFC adopts
a divide-and-conquer mechanism that converts the original huge table into
several much small tables together with some integer operations. NetFC adopts a
scaling-factor mechanism for computational accuracy improvement, and a
prefix-based lossless table compression method to reduce the memory overhead.
We use different types of datasets to evaluate NetFC. The experimental results
show that the average accuracy of NetFC can be as high as up to 99.94% at worst
with only 448KB memory consumption. Furthermore, we integrate NetFC into Sonata
for detecting Slowloris attack, yielding significant decrease of detection

GASS survey, selected based on their star-formation rate (SFR) and gas fraction
to be in the regime that can best distinguish between the proposed models. We
perform Wide Field Spectrograph (WiFeS) integral field spectroscopic (IFS)

velocities and orbital periods in these galaxies. Comparing the relation
between the SFR, velocity dispersion, and gas fraction with predictions of
these two theoretical models, we find that our results are most consistent with
a model that includes both transport and feedback as drivers of turbulence in
the interstellar medium. By contrast, a model where stellar feedback alone
drives turbulence under-predicts the observed velocity dispersion in our
galaxies, and does not reproduce the observed trend with gas fraction. These
observations therefore support the idea that gravitational instability makes a
substantial contribution to turbulence in high redshift and high SFR galaxies.

learn the embeddings that fit the proximity by matrix factorization. Most
existing matrix factorization methods adopt the same proximity for different
tasks, while it is observed that different tasks and datasets may require
different proximity, limiting their representation power.
  Motivated by this, we propose {\em Lemane}, a framework with trainable
proximity measures, which can be learned to best suit the datasets and tasks at
hand automatically. Our method is end-to-end, which incorporates differentiable
SVD in the pipeline so that the parameters can be trained via backpropagation.
However, this learning process is still expensive on large graphs. To improve
the scalability, we train proximity measures only on carefully subsampled
graphs, and then apply standard proximity matrix factorization on the original
graph using the learned proximity. Note that, computing the learned proximities
for each pair is still expensive for large graphs, and existing techniques for
computing proximities are not applicable to the learned proximities. Thus, we
present generalized push techniques to make our solution scalable to large
graphs with millions of nodes. Extensive experiments show that our proposed
solution outperforms existing solutions on both link prediction and node
classification tasks on almost all datasets.

which builds the networks and clusters the training data in a tree-structured

position training with fixed position inference and inverse propensity weighted
training with no position inference alleviate the bias problem to some extend.
However, the different treatment of position information between training and
inference will inevitably lead to inconsistency and sub-optimal online
performance. Meanwhile, the basic assumption of these methods, i.e., the click
probability is the product of examination probability and relevance
probability, is oversimplified and insufficient to model the rich interaction
between position and other information. In this paper, we propose a Deep
Position-wise Interaction Network (DPIN) to efficiently combine all candidate
items and positions for estimating CTR at each position, achieving consistency
between offline and online as well as modeling the deep non-linear interaction

a new evaluation metrics named PAUC (position-wise AUC) that is suitable for
measuring the ranking quality at a given position. Through extensive

a risk bounded trajectory planning method that looks for continuous-time

is defined as the probability of collision with uncertain obstacles. Existing
approaches to address risk bounded trajectory planning problems either are
limited to Gaussian uncertainties and convex obstacles or rely on
sampling-based methods that need uncertainty samples and time discretization.
To address the risk bounded trajectory planning problem, we leverage the notion
of risk contours to transform the risk bounded planning problem into a
deterministic optimization problem. Risk contours are the set of all points in
the uncertain environment with guaranteed bounded risk. The obtained
deterministic optimization is, in general, nonlinear and nonconvex time-varying

an enlarged channel matrix dimension leads to excessive parameters of applying
spherical-wave channel model (SWM). Moreover, due to the adoption of hybrid

learning and pattern recognition problems over the last decades. In this work
we present a simple approach based on concepts from statistical physics to
learn optimal distance metric for a given problem. We formulate the task as a
typical statistical physics problem: distances between patterns represent
constituents of a physical system and the objective function corresponds to
energy. Then we express the problem as a minimization of the free energy of a
complex system, which is equivalent to distance metric learning. Much like for
many problems in physics, we propose an approach based on Metropolis Monte
Carlo to find the best distance metric. This provides a natural way to learn
the distance metric, where the learning process can be intuitively seen as
stretching and rotating the metric space until some heuristic is satisfied. Our
proposed method can handle a wide variety of constraints including those with
spurious local minima. The approach works surprisingly well with stochastic
nearest neighbors from neighborhood component analysis (NCA). Experimental
results on artificial and real-world data sets reveal a clear superiority over
a number of state-of-the-art distance metric learning methods for nearest

category of reinforcement learning and see its application in many domains,
such as modeling a climate control system where temperature, humidity, etc.
change slowly over time. However, this subject is less addressed in recent
studies. Classical methods with certain variants, such as Dynamic Programming
with Tile Coding which discretizes the state space, fail to handle slowly
changing variables because those methods cannot capture the tiny changes in
each transition step, as it is computationally expensive or impossible to
establish an extremely granular grid system. In this paper, we introduce a
Hyperspace Neighbor Penetration (HNP) approach that solves the problem. HNP
captures in each transition step the state's partial ""penetration"" into its
neighboring hyper-tiles in the gridded hyperspace, thus does not require the
transition to be inter-tile in order for the change to be captured. Therefore,
HNP allows for a very coarse grid system, which makes the computation feasible.
HNP assumes near linearity of the transition function in a local space, which
is commonly satisfied. In summary, HNP can be orders of magnitude more
efficient than classical method in handling slowly changing variables in
reinforcement learning. We have made an industrial implementation of NHP with a
great success.

the field survey, the decay transients surprisingly reached negative values in
a terrain where a thin conducting layer is sandwiched between thick upper and
thin lower resistive layers and the decay transients were highly dependent on
base frequency of the transmitter waveforms. The major advantage of using the
SQUIDs in TDEM applications is its extremely high sensitivity maintained at low

enhanced electric power and energy conversion efficiency. While for nanopores
longer than 30 nm, the slipping surfaceinner plays a dominant role in the
increase of electric power, which induces a considerable decrease in energy
conversion efficiency due to enhanced transport of both cations and anions.
Considering the difficulty in hydrodynamic slip modification to the
surfaceinner of nanopores, the surface modification to the surfaceL may be a
better choice to achieve high-performance OEC. Our results provide feasible
guidance to the design of porous membranes for high-performance osmotic energy
harvesting.

defined as the product of the partition ratio and the diffusivity of

the membrane driven by external forces. Here, we study nonequilibrium membrane
permeation orchestrated by a uniform external driving field using molecular
computer simulations and continuum (Smoluchowski) theory in the stationary
state. In the simulations, we explicitly resolve the penetrants' transport
across a finite monomer-resolved polymer network, addressing one-component
penetrant systems and mixtures. We introduce and discuss possible definitions
of nonequilibrium, force-dependent permeability, representing `system' and
`membrane' permeability. In particular, we present for the first time a
definition of the differential permeability response to the force. We
demonstrate that the latter turns out to be significantly nonlinear for
low-permeable systems, leading to a high amount of selectiveness in
permeability, called `permselectivity', and is tunable by the driving force.
Our continuum-level analytical solutions exhibit remarkable qualitative
agreement with the penetrant- and polymer-resolved simulations, thereby
allowing us to characterize the underlying mechanism of permeabilities and
steady-state transport beyond the linear response level.

attributes (e.g. features and labels) of the same data entity (e.g. a person)

the common data entities shared by all parties. It is usually achieved by
Private Set Intersection (PSI) which identifies the intersection of training
samples from all parties by using personal identifiable information (e.g.
email) as sample IDs to align data instances. As a result, PSI would make
sample IDs of the intersection visible to all parties, and therefore each party
can know that the data entities shown in the intersection also appear in the
other parties, i.e. intersection membership. However, in many real-world
privacy-sensitive organizations, e.g. banks and hospitals, revealing membership
of their data entities is prohibited. In this paper, we propose a vFL framework
based on Private Set Union (PSU) that allows each party to keep sensitive
membership information to itself. Instead of identifying the intersection of
all training samples, our PSU protocol generates the union of samples as

features and labels to handle samples that belong to the union but not the
intersection. Through extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, we show
our framework can protect the privacy of the intersection membership while

star-forming galaxies at $z \lesssim 1.5$, observing only a modest increase in
the prevalence of discs between $z\approx1.5$ and $z\approx0.04$ at fixed
stellar mass. Furthermore, typical star-forming galaxies follow the same median
relation between specific angular momentum and stellar mass, regardless of
their redshift, with the normalisation of the relation depending more strongly
on how disc-like a galaxy's kinematics are. This suggests that massive
star-forming discs form in a very similar manner across the $\approx$ 10 Gyr
encompassed by our study and that the inferred link between the angular
momentum of galaxies and their haloes does not change significantly across the

a quantile function or a prediction interval of the true label conditioned on
the input. It is frequently observed that quantile regression -- a vanilla
algorithm for learning quantiles with asymptotic guarantees -- tends to
\emph{under-cover} than the desired coverage level in reality. While various
fixes have been proposed, a more fundamental understanding of why this
under-coverage bias happens in the first place remains elusive.
  In this paper, we present a rigorous theoretical study on the coverage of
uncertainty estimation algorithms in learning quantiles. We prove that quantile
regression suffers from an inherent under-coverage bias, in a vanilla setting
where we learn a realizable linear quantile function and there is more data
than parameters. More quantitatively, for $\alpha>0.5$ and small $d/n$, the
$\alpha$-quantile learned by quantile regression roughly achieves coverage
$\alpha - (\alpha-1/2)\cdot d/n$ regardless of the noise distribution, where
$d$ is the input dimension and $n$ is the number of training data. Our theory
reveals that this under-coverage bias stems from a certain high-dimensional
parameter estimation error that is not implied by existing theories on quantile
regression. Experiments on simulated and real data verify our theory and
further illustrate the effect of various factors such as sample size and model
capacity on the under-coverage bias in more practical setups.

OVRO, Medicina and Mets\""ahovi. Additionally, four deep exposures (several
hours long) with simultaneous MAGIC and NuSTAR observations allowed a precise
measurement of the falling segments of the two spectral components. The
very-high-energy (VHE; E > 100 GeV) gamma rays and X-rays are positively
correlated at zero time lag, but the strength and characteristics of the
correlation change substantially across the various energy bands probed. The
VHE versus X-ray fluxes follow different patterns, partly due to substantial
changes in the Compton dominance during a few days without a simultaneous
increase in the X-ray flux (i.e. orphan gamma-ray activity). Studying the
broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) during the days including NuSTAR
observations, we show that these changes can be explained within a one-zone
leptonic model with a blob that increases its size over time. Our multi-band
correlation study also hints at an anti-correlation between UV/optical and
X-ray at a significance higher than 3 sigmas. A VHE flare observed on 2017
February 4 shows gamma-ray variability on multi-hour timescales, with a factor
10 increase in the TeV flux but only a moderate increase in the keV flux. The
related broadband SED is better described by a two-zone leptonic scenario
rather than by a one-zone scenario. We find that the flare can be produced by
the appearance of a compact second blob populated by high energetic electrons
spanning a narrow range of Lorentz factors.

to accommodate new tasks not seen during training, given only a few examples.
To handle the limited-data problem in few-shot regimes, recent methods tend to
collectively use a set of local features to densely represent an image instead
of using a mixed global feature. They generally explore a unidirectional
query-to-support paradigm in FSL, e.g., find the nearest/optimal support
feature for each query feature and aggregate these local matches for a joint
classification. In this paper, we propose a new method Mutual Centralized
Learning (MCL) to fully affiliate the two disjoint sets of dense features in a
bidirectional paradigm. We associate each local feature with a particle that
can bidirectionally random walk in a discrete feature space by the
affiliations. To estimate the class probability, we propose the features'
accessibility that measures the expected number of visits to the support
features of that class in a Markov process. We relate our method to learning a
centrality on an affiliation network and demonstrate its capability to be
plugged in existing methods by highlighting centralized local features.
Experiments show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art on both
miniImageNet and tieredImageNet.

systems. Existing methods heavily rely on accurate demographic annotations.
However, such annotations are usually unavailable in real scenarios. Moreover,
these methods are typically designed for a specific demographic group and are
not general enough. In this paper, we propose a false positive rate penalty
loss, which mitigates face recognition bias by increasing the consistency of
instance False Positive Rate (FPR). Specifically, we first define the instance
FPR as the ratio between the number of the non-target similarities above a
unified threshold and the total number of the non-target similarities. The
unified threshold is estimated for a given total FPR. Then, an additional
penalty term, which is in proportion to the ratio of instance FPR overall FPR,
is introduced into the denominator of the softmax-based loss. The larger the
instance FPR, the larger the penalty. By such unequal penalties, the instance
FPRs are supposed to be consistent. Compared with the previous debiasing
methods, our method requires no demographic annotations. Thus, it can mitigate
the bias among demographic groups divided by various attributes, and these
attributes are not needed to be previously predefined during training.
Extensive experimental results on popular benchmarks demonstrate the
superiority of our method over state-of-the-art competitors. Code and trained
models are available at https://github.com/Tencent/TFace.

with the UVIT and the GMRT. XUV galaxies show filamentary or diffuse star
formation well beyond their optical disks, in regions where the disk surface
density lies below the threshold for star formation. GALEX observations found
that surprisingly 30% of all the nearby spiral galaxies have XUV disks. The XUV
galaxies can be broadly classified as type 1 and type 2 XUV disks. The type 1
XUV disks have star formation that is linked to that in their main disk, and
the UV emission appears as extended, filamentary spiral arms. The UV luminosity
is associated with compact star forming regions along the extended spiral arms.
The star formation is probably driven by slow gas accretion from nearby
galaxies or the intergalactic medium (IGM). But the type 2 XUV disks have star
formation associated with an outer low luminosity stellar disk that is often
truncated near the optical radius of the galaxy. The nature of the stellar
disks in type 2 XUV disks are similar to that of the diffuse stellar disks of
low surface brightness galaxies. The star formation in type 2 XUV disks is
thought to be due to rapid gas accretion or gas infall from nearby high
velocity clouds (HVCs), interacting galaxies or the IGM. In this paper we
investigate the star formation properties of the XUV regions of two type 2
galaxies and one mixed XUV type galaxy and compare them with the neutral
hydrogen (HI) emission in their disks. We present preliminary results of our

self-organization and swarm intelligence. Here a swarm system, called
Databionic swarm (DBS), is introduced which is able to adapt itself to
structures of high-dimensional data characterized by distance and/or
density-based structures in the data space. By exploiting the interrelations of
swarm intelligence, self-organization and emergence, DBS serves as an
alternative approach to the optimization of a global objective function in the
task of clustering. The swarm omits the usage of a global objective function
and is parameter-free because it searches for the Nash equilibrium during its
annealing process. To our knowledge, DBS is the first swarm combining these
approaches. Its clustering can outperform common clustering methods such as
K-means, PAM, single linkage, spectral clustering, model-based clustering, and
Ward, if no prior knowledge about the data is available. A central problem in
clustering is the correct estimation of the number of clusters. This is
addressed by a DBS visualization called topographic map which allows assessing
the number of clusters. It is known that all clustering algorithms construct
clusters, irrespective of the data set contains clusters or not. In contrast to
most other clustering algorithms, the topographic map identifies, that
clustering of the data is meaningless if the data contains no (natural)
clusters. The performance of DBS is demonstrated on a set of benchmark data,
which are constructed to pose difficult clustering problems and in two
real-world applications.

some samples are noisy. The unequal contributions of samples has a considerable
effect on training performances. Studies focusing on unequal sample

two common techniques in RML. Numerous learning algorithms have been proposed

contradict with different learning algorithms. For example, some strategies
take the hard samples first, whereas some strategies take easy first.
Conducting a clear comparison for existing RML algorithms in dealing with
different samples is difficult due to lack of a unified theoretical framework

positive semidefinite tensor analysis has been proposed. This unsupervised
(blind) method, however, severely restrict the structure of frequency
covariance matrices (FCMs) to reduce the number of model parameters. As an
extension of these conventional approaches, we here propose a supervised method
that models FCMs using deep neural networks (DNNs). It is difficult to directly
infer FCMs using DNNs. Therefore, we also propose a new FCM model represented
as a convex combination of a diagonal FCM and a rank-1 FCM. Our FCM model is
flexible enough to not only consider inter-frequency correlation, but also
capture the dynamics of time-varying FCMs of nonstationary signals. We infer
the proposed FCMs using two DNNs: DNN for power spectrum estimation and DNN for
time-domain signal estimation. An experimental result of separating music

understanding of the functioning of nervous systems in general. Here we
consider their evolution and describe their functions of communication,
modulation and computation within nervous systems. The ionic mechanisms
underlying action potentials in the squid giant axon were first described by
Hodgkin and Huxley in 1952 and their findings have formed our orthodox view of
how the physiological action potential functions. However, substantial evidence
has now accumulated to show that the action potential is accompanied by a
synchronized coupled soliton pressure pulse in the cell membrane, the action
potential pulse (APPulse). Here we explore the interactions between the soliton
and the ionic mechanisms known to be associated with the action potential.
Computational models of the action potential usually describe it as a binary
event, but we suggest that it is quantum ternary event known as the
computational action potential (CAP), whose temporal fixed point is threshold,
rather than the rather plastic action potential peak used in other models. The
CAP accompanies the APPulse and the Physiological action potential. Therefore,
we conclude that nerve impulses appear to be an ensemble of three inseparable,
interdependent, concurrent states: the physiological action potential, the
APPulse and the CAP.

of pairs $(B,G_{B})$ such that $X\simeq Km_{3}(B,G_{B})$. When the surface is

for which the number of Kummer structures is $2^{n}$. We then give a
classification of the moduli spaces of generalized Kummer surfaces. When the
surface is non algebraic, there is only one Kummer structure, but the number of
irreducible components of the moduli spaces of such surfaces is large compared
to the algebraic case. The endomorphism rings of the complex $2$-tori we study

integers. One can also see this paper as a study of quaternion orders
$\mathcal{O}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ that contain the ring of Eisenstein integers.
We obtain that such order is determined up to isomorphism by its discriminant,
and when the quaternion algebra is indefinite, the order $\mathcal{O}$ is
principal.

NAT models are prone to learn fine-grained lower-mode knowledge, such as words

progressive multi-granularity training for NAT. More specifically, to make the
most of the training data, we break down the sentence-level examples into three

progressively increase the granularities. Experiments on Romanian-English,

approach improves the phrase translation accuracy and model reordering ability,
therefore resulting in better translation quality against strong NAT baselines.
Also, we show that more deterministic fine-grained knowledge can further
enhance performance.

previous paper using macroparticle tracking simulations from the pyHeadTail
code and a simple analytical formula which was proposed as an extension of the
ansatz used for the single-particle formalism. In this paper, we propose a
self-consistent derivation of this formula based on the linearized Vlasov
equation. The proposed mode coupling instability for coasting beams was never
predicted or discussed in the past and we believe that the reason is twofold.
First, to derive it analytically from the linearized Vlasov equation, one
should not make the usual approximation $\sin(\phi)\simeq (e^{j\phi})/(2j)$,
where $\phi$ is the transverse betatron phase, but really consider the two
terms of $\sin(\phi)=(e^{j\phi}-e^{-j\phi})/(2j)$ as the second term is the one
responsible for the mode coupling in coasting beams. It should be stressed here
that mode coupling is found already with driving impedance only. Note that the
previous approximation is also usually made for bunched beams and this case
should therefore also be carefully reviewed in the future. Second, by including
the detuning impedance, the coupling is much stronger and this is what we found
also in pyHeadTail simulations.

a rotating black hole, by adding an additional hair, besides the mass $M$ and
the angular momentum $J$, known as the `tidal charge' parameter, $\beta$. In a
braneworld scenario with one extra spatial dimension, the extra dimension is
expected to manifest itself through -- (a) negative values of $\beta$, and (b)
modified gravitational perturbations. This in turn would affect the
quasi-normal modes of rotating black holes. We numerically solve the perturbed
gravitational field equations using the continued fractions method and
determine the quasi-normal mode spectra for the braneworld black hole. We find
that increasingly negative values of $\beta$ correspond to a diminishing
imaginary part of the quasi-normal mode, or equivalently, an increasing damping
time. Using the publicly available data of the properties of the remnant black
hole in the gravitational wave signal GW150914, we check for consistency
between the predicted values (for a given $\beta$) of the frequency and damping
time of the least-damped $\ell=2,m=2$ quasi-normal mode and measurements of
these quantities using other independent techniques. We find that it is highly
unlikely for the tidal charge, $\beta \lesssim -0.05$, providing a conservative
limit on the tidal charge parameter. Implications and future directions are
discussed.

One approach consists in pointing out explicit expressions of the probability

the random variables. We propose an algorithm in order to generate the first
passage time through a given level of a one-dimensional jump diffusion. This
process satisfies a stochastic differential equation driven by a Brownian
motion and subject to random shocks characterized by an independent Poisson
process. Our algorithm belongs to the family of rejection sampling procedures,
also called exact simulation in this context: the outcome of the algorithm and
the stopping time under consideration are identically distributed. It is based
on both the exact simulation of the diffusion at a given time and on the exact
simulation of first passage time for continuous diffusions. It is therefore
based on an extension of the algorithm introduced by Herrmann and Zucca [16] in
the continuous framework. The challenge here is to generate the exact position
of a continuous diffusion conditionally to the fact that the given level has
not been reached before. We present the construction of the algorithm and give

final layer weights are calculated before training commences and all the
contributions are appended to weights of the final layer, i.e., the effective

essentially collapses the network, precluding the necessity for weight updation
of all weights not in the final layer. This reduction in parameters results in
lower memory usage and higher training speed. We show that our algorithm
produces the exact same output as BP, in contrast to several recently proposed

approaches between a potential flow model and a viscous model are investigated.
  The first model is a fully nonlinear potential flow (FNPF) model based on the
Harmonic Polynomial Cell (HPC) method, which is highly accurate and best suited
for representing long distance wave propagation. The second model is a CFD
code, solving the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations within the
\openfoam toolkit, more suited to represent viscous and turbulent effects at
local scale in the body vicinity. Two one-way coupling strategies are developed
and compared in two dimensions, considering fully submerged and fixed
structures. A domain decomposition (DD) strategy is first considered,
introducing a refined mesh in the body vicinity on which the RANS equations are
solved. Boundary conditions and interpolation operators from the FNPF results
are developed in order to enforce values at its outer boundary. The second
coupling strategy considers a decomposition of variables (functional
decomposition, FD) on the local grid. As the FNPF simulation provides fields of
variables satisfying the irrotational Euler equations, complementary velocity
and pressure components are introduced as the difference between the total flow
variables and the potential ones. Those complementary variables are solutions
of modified RANS equations. Comparisons are presented for nonlinear waves
interacting with a horizontal cylinder of rectangular cross-section. The loads
exerted on the body computed from the four simulation methods (standalone FNPF,
standalone CFD, DD and FD coupling schemes) are compared with experimental
data. It is shown that both coupling approaches produce an accurate
representation of the loads and associated hydrodynamic coefficients over a

The most challenging event detected so far is the short duration

two black holes of source frame masses of $81^{+62}_{-25}M_\odot$ and
$52^{+32}_{-32}M_\odot$ undergoing two encounters and then merging into an
intermediate-mass black hole. We find that the hyperbolic merger hypothesis is
favored with respect to a quasi-circular merger with precessing spins with
Bayes' factors larger than 4300 to 1, although this number will be reduced by
the currently uncertain prior odds. Our results suggest that GW190521 might be

defines a security architecture for IoT software updates, standardizing the
metadata and the cryptographic tools-namely, digital signatures and hash
functions-that guarantee the legitimacy of software updates. While the
performance of SUIT has previously been evaluated in the pre-quantum context,
it has not yet been studied in a post-quantum context. Taking the open-source
implementation of SUIT available in RIOT as a case study, we overview
post-quantum considerations, and quantum-resistant digital signatures in
particular, focusing on lowpower, microcontroller-based IoT devices which have
stringent resource constraints in terms of memory, CPU, and energy consumption.
We benchmark a selection of proposed post-quantum signature schemes (LMS,
Falcon, and Dilithium) and compare them with current pre-quantum signature
schemes (Ed25519 and ECDSA). Our benchmarks are carried out on a variety of IoT
hardware including ARM Cortex-M, RISC-V, and Espressif (ESP32), which form the
bulk of modern 32-bit microcontroller architectures. We interpret our benchmark
results in the context of SUIT, and estimate the real-world impact of
post-quantum alternatives for a range of typical software update categories.

  We achieve our result by defining \emph{multiway} OCSes which receive
arbitrarily many elements at each step, rather than just two. In addition to
better competitive ratios, our formulation allows for a simpler reduction from
edge-weighted online bipartite matching to OCSes. While Fahrbach et al. used a

directly connects the competitive ratio to the parameters of the multiway OCS.

absorption spectra in 2D black phosphorous, so-called phosphorene, as a
function of the concentration of electrons injected into the conduction band.
The mechanisms of phosphorene exciton quenching versus doping are studied in
detail. It is demonstrated that already small doping levels ($n\sim

i.e., from $600\,{\rm meV}$ to $128\,{\rm meV}$. The screened conductivity is
applied to study the collective electromagnetic modes in doped phosphorene. It
is shown that the phosphorene transversal exciton hybridizes with free photons
to form a exciton-polariton. This phenomenon is experimentally observed only
for the case of confined electromagnetic microcavity modes. Finally, we
demonstrate that the energy and intensity of anisotropic 2D plasmon-polaritons

rapidly in recent years. MEC aims to reduce the service delay of mobile users,
while alleviating the processing pressure on the core network. MEC can be
regarded as an extension of cloud computing on the user side, which can deploy
edge servers and bring computing resources closer to mobile users, and provide
more efficient interactions. However, due to the user's dynamic mobility, the
distance between the user and the edge server will change dynamically, which
may cause fluctuations in Quality of Service (QoS). Therefore, when a mobile
user moves in the MEC environment, certain approaches are needed to schedule
services deployed on the edge server to ensure the user experience. In this
paper, we model service scheduling in MEC scenarios and propose a delay-aware
and mobility-aware service management approach based on concise probabilistic
methods. This approach has low computational complexity and can effectively
reduce service delay and migration costs. Furthermore, we conduct experiments
by utilizing multiple realistic datasets and use iFogSim to evaluate the
performance of the algorithm. The results show that our proposed approach can
optimize the performance on service delay, with 8% to 20% improvement and
reduce the migration cost by more than 75% compared with baselines during the

for approximating $d$-dimensional piecewise continuous functions and for
solving elliptic interface problems is developed. There are three novel
features in the present network; namely, (i) jump discontinuities are
accurately captured, (ii) it is completely shallow, comprising only one hidden
layer, (iii) it is completely mesh-free for solving partial differential
equations. The crucial idea here is that a $d$-dimensional piecewise continuous
function can be extended to a continuous function defined in
$(d+1)$-dimensional space, where the augmented coordinate variable labels the
pieces of each sub-domain. We then construct a shallow neural network to
express this new function. Since only one hidden layer is employed, the number
of training parameters (weights and biases) scales linearly with the dimension
and the neurons used in the hidden layer. For solving elliptic interface
problems, the network is trained by minimizing the mean square error loss that
consists of the residual of the governing equation, boundary condition, and the
interface jump conditions. We perform a series of numerical tests to
demonstrate the accuracy of the present network. Our DCSNN model is efficient
due to only a moderate number of parameters needed to be trained (a few hundred
parameters used throughout all numerical examples), and the results indicate
good accuracy. Compared with the results obtained by the traditional grid-based
immersed interface method (IIM), which is designed particularly for elliptic
interface problems, our network model shows a better accuracy than IIM. We
conclude by solving a six-dimensional problem to demonstrate the capability of
the present network for high-dimensional applications.

decisions on the benefit of a treatment are possibly better informed by more
individualized predictions of the absolute treatment effect. In case of a
binary outcome, these predictions of absolute individualized treatment effect
require knowledge of the individual's risk without treatment and incorporation
of a possibly differential treatment effect (i.e. varying with patient
characteristics). In this paper we lay out the causal structure of
individualized treatment effect in terms of potential outcomes and describe the
required assumptions that underlie a causal interpretation of its prediction.
Subsequently, we describe regression models and model estimation techniques
that can be used to move from average to more individualized treatment effect
predictions. We focus mainly on logistic regression-based methods that are both
well-known and naturally provide the required probabilistic estimates. We
incorporate key components from both causal inference and prediction research
to arrive at individualized treatment effect predictions. While the separate
components are well known, their successful amalgamation is very much an
ongoing field of research. We cut the problem down to its essentials in the
setting of a randomized trial, discuss the importance of a clear definition of
the estimand of interest, provide insight into the required assumptions, and
give guidance with respect to modeling and estimation options. Simulated data
illustrates the potential of different modeling options across scenarios that
vary both average treatment effect and treatment effect heterogeneity. Two
applied examples illustrate individualized treatment effect prediction in
randomized trial data.

known as counter Evershed flows (CEFs). We aim to determine the frequency of
occurrence of CEFs in active regions (ARs) and to characterize their lifetime
and the prevailing conditions in the ARs. We analysed the continuum images,
Dopplergrams, and magnetograms recorded by SDO/HMI of 97 ARs that appeared from
2011 to 2017. We followed the ARs for $9.6\pm1.4$ days on average. We found 384
CEFs in total, with a median value of 6 CEFs per AR. CEFs are a rather common
feature, they occur in 83.5% of all ARs regardless of the magnetic complexity
of the AR. However, CEFs were observed on average only during 5.9% of the mean

follows a log-normal distribution with a median value of 10.6$_{-6.0}^{+12.4}$

cards are enrolled with fully uncovered face images. However, in the current
global situation, face matching systems should be able to match these reference
images with masked face images. As an example, in an airport or security
checkpoint it is safer to match the unmasked image of the identifying document
to the masked person rather than asking them to remove the mask. We find that
current facial recognition techniques are not robust to this form of occlusion.
  To address this unique requirement presented due to the current circumstance,
we propose a set of re-purposed datasets and a benchmark for researchers to
use. We also propose a contrastive visual representation learning based
pre-training workflow which is specialized to masked vs unmasked face matching.
We ensure that our method learns robust features to differentiate people across
varying data collection scenarios. We achieve this by training over many
different datasets and validating our result by testing on various holdout
datasets. The specialized weights trained by our method outperform standard
face recognition features for masked to unmasked face matching. We believe the
provided synthetic mask generating code, our novel training approach and the
trained weights from the masked face models will help in adopting existing face
recognition systems to operate in the current global environment. We
open-source all contributions for broader use by the research community.

dataset biases rather than performing reasoning, hindering generalization. It
has been recently shown that better reasoning patterns emerge in attention
layers of a state-of-the-art VQA model when they are trained on perfect

learn to reason when training conditions are favorable enough. However,
transferring this learned knowledge to deployable models is a challenge, as
much of it is lost during the transfer. We propose a method for knowledge
transfer based on a regularization term in our loss function, supervising the
sequence of required reasoning operations. We provide a theoretical analysis
based on PAC-learning, showing that such program prediction can lead to
decreased sample complexity under mild hypotheses. We also demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach experimentally on the GQA dataset and show its

highest minutia qualities, MiDeCon also accurately determines the quality of a

The volume fractions are $0.01\%$ and $0.07\%$, respectively. The particles,
which are initially randomly positioned, ultimately display characteristic
spatial distributions which can be categorised into four modes. Modes $(i)$ to
$(iii)$ are observed in the Taylor vortex flow regime, while mode ($iv$)
encompasses both the wavy vortex, and turbulent Taylor vortex flow regimes.
Mode $(i)$ corresponds to stable orbits away from the vortex cores. Remarkably,
in a narrow $\textit{Ta}$ range, particles get trapped in the Taylor vortex
cores (mode ($ii$)). Mode $(iii)$ is the transition when both modes $(i)$ and
$(ii)$ are observed. For mode $(iv)$, particles distribute throughout the
domain due to flow instabilities. All four modes show characteristic
orientational statistics. We find the particle clustering for mode ($ii$) to be
size-dependent, with two main observations. Firstly, particle agglomeration at
the core is much higher for $\ell/d=0.2$ compared to $\ell/d=0.1$. Secondly,
the $\textit{Ta}$ range for which clustering is observed depends on the
particle size. For this mode $(ii)$ we observe particles to align strongly with
the local cylinder tangent. The most pronounced particle alignment is observed
for $\ell/d=0.2$ around $\textit{Ta}=4.2\times10^5$. This observation is found

under the influence of vibrational phonon modes in a bias voltage junction. The
molecular quantum dot system is realized by coupled quantum dots inside a
suspended carbon nanotube. We consider the dynamical entanglement as a function
of bias voltage and temperature by taking into account the electron-phonon
interaction. In order to generate the robust entanglement between quantum dots
and preserve it to reach the maximal achievable amount steadily, we introduce
an asymmetric coupling protocol and apply the easy tunable bias voltage-driven
field. For an oscillating bias voltage, the time-varying entanglement can
periodically reach the maximum revival. In thermal entanglement dynamics, the
phenomena of thermal entanglement degradation and thermal entanglement revival
are observed which are intensively affected by the strength of phonon
decoherence. The revival of entanglement shows a larger value for a higher
phonon coupling.

structure. We have observed this source in the C$^{34}$S, SO, and OCS lines at
3.1 mm with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). A
substructure of this source is traced by our high angular-resolution
observation (0\farcs12; 20 au) of the continuum emission. The
northwest-southeast (NW-SE) outflow on a 2\arcsec\ scale is detected in the SO
($J_N$ = $2_2$--$1_1$) line. Based on the morphology of the SO distribution,
this bipolar outflow structure seems to originate from the protostar A1 and its
circumstellar disk, or the circummultiple structure of Source A. The rotation
motion of the NW-SE outflow is detected in the SO and OCS emissions. We
evaluate the specific angular momentum of the outflowing gas to be $(8.6 -
14.3) \times 10^{-4}$ km s$^{-1}$ pc. If the driving source of this outflow is
the protostar A1 and its circumstellar disk, it can be a potential mechanism to
extract the specific angular momentum of the disk structure. These results can
be a hint for the outflow launching mechanism in this source. Furthermore, they
provide us with an important clue to resolve the complicated structure of IRAS

single-view-multi-angle consistency (SVMAC) to significantly improve the

3D pose and a camera simultaneously. During training, the estimated 3D pose is
rotated by random angles and the estimated camera projects the rotated 3D poses
back to 2D. The 2D reprojections will be fed into weight-sharing generators to
estimate the corresponding 3D poses and cameras, which are then mixed to impose
SVMAC constraints to self-supervise the training process. The experimental
results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised

auto-regressive (VAR) model to this TSRVF-PCA time series leads to statistical

studies qubits coupled to a mode continuum, exposing them to a loss channel and
causing quantum information to be lost before coherent operations can be
performed. Here we restore coherence by realizing a dark state that exploits
symmetry properties and interactions between four qubits. Dark states decouple
from the waveguide and are thus a valuable resource for quantum information but
also come with a challenge: they cannot be controlled by the waveguide drive.
We overcome this problem by designing a drive that utilizes the symmetry
properties of the collective state manifold allowing us to selectively drive
both bright and dark states. The decay time of the dark state exceeds that of
the waveguide-limited single qubit by more than two orders of magnitude.
Spectroscopy on the second excitation manifold provides further insight into
the level structure of the hybridized system. Our experiment paves the way for
implementations of quantum many-body physics in waveguides and the realization
of quantum information protocols using decoherence-free subspaces.

played a relevant role in the very early stages of the Universe. Compared to
the standard inflationary paradigm, they may lead to modifications in
observable quantities, e.g. the anisotropies found in the cosmic microwave
background. Kinetically dominated regimes arise in classical fast-roll
scenarios as well as in quantum bouncing cosmologies. For instance, kinetic
dominance is typical in interesting preinflationary phases of Loop Quantum
Cosmology. In this work, we analyze the leading-order effects that the presence
of a scalar field potential causes on the primordial cosmological perturbations
in these kinetically dominated epochs. These effects can be grouped in two
sets, namely, those that affect the effective mass of the perturbations and
those that affect the choice of their vacuum state. The effective mass is
modified directly by terms that include the potential, but also indirectly by
the change in the background dynamics and the relation between the
parameterization of these dynamics and the conformal time, usually employed to
describe the evolution of the perturbations. On the other hand, away from de
Sitter inflation, the Bunch-Davies state is no longer the most natural vacuum
at all scales. Recent proposals suggest to modify it by carrying out certain
Hamiltonian diagonalization with a suitable asymptotic behavior at large
wavenumber scales. Both this diagonalization condition and the imposed
asymptotic behavior depend on the effective mass of the perturbations, and
therefore the selected vacuum state varies in the presence of the scalar field
potential.

machine translation (NMT), by drastically reducing the need for large parallel
data. Most approaches adapt masked-language modeling (MLM) to
sequence-to-sequence architectures, by masking parts of the input and
reconstructing them in the decoder. In this work, we systematically compare
masking with alternative objectives that produce inputs resembling real (full)
sentences, by reordering and replacing words based on their context. We
pretrain models with different methods on English$\leftrightarrow$German,
English$\leftrightarrow$Nepali and English$\leftrightarrow$Sinhala monolingual
data, and evaluate them on NMT. In (semi-) supervised NMT, varying the
pretraining objective leads to surprisingly small differences in the finetuned
performance, whereas unsupervised NMT is much more sensitive to it. To
understand these results, we thoroughly study the pretrained models using a
series of probes and verify that they encode and use information in different
ways. We conclude that finetuning on parallel data is mostly sensitive to few
properties that are shared by most models, such as a strong decoder, in
contrast to unsupervised NMT that also requires models with strong
cross-lingual abilities.

wide interest for their ability to constitute dark matter and explain the

during PTs model-independently. Because of the randomness of the quantum
tunneling, there always exists some probability that the vacuum decay is
postponed in a whole Hubble volume. Since the vacuum energy density remains
constant while radiation is quickly redshifted in the expanding Universe, the
postponed vacuum decay then results in overdense regions, which finally
collapse into PBHs as indicated by numerical simulations. Utilizing this result
one can obtain mutual predictions and constraints between PBHs and GWs from
PTs. The predicted mass function of PBHs is nearly monochromatic. We
investigate two typical cases and find that 1) PBHs from a PT constitute all
dark matter and GWs peak at $1$Hz, 2) PBHs from a PT can explain the
coalescence events observed by LIGO-Virgo collaboration, and meanwhile GWs can
explain the common-spectrum process detected by NANOGrav collaboration.

algorithm in the order-oblivious setting. An algorithm A is instance-optimal in
the order-oblivious setting for a certain class of algorithms A* if the

  - A takes as input a sequence of objects from some domain;
  - for any instance $\sigma$ and any algorithm A' in A*, the runtime of A on

optimal on every possible input (and not only in the worst case).
  We design instance-optimal algorithms for the problem of reporting, given a
bichromatic set of points in the plane S, all pairs consisting of points of
different color which span an empty axis-aligned rectangle (or reporting all
points which appear in such a pair). This problem has applications for
training-set reduction in nearest-neighbour classifiers. It is also related to
the problem consisting of finding the decision boundaries of a euclidean
nearest-neighbour classifier, for which Bremner et al. (2005) gave an optimal
output-sensitive algorithm.
  By showing the existence of an instance-optimal algorithm in the

closer to their limits by adapting and extending them to a setting which
exhibits highly non-local features. Previous problems for which
instance-optimal algorithms were proven to exist were based solely on local

function only based on whether the function is better, worse, or similar for
given pairs of candidate optimization vectors. Such optimization problems arise
in many real-life examples, such as finding the optimal calibration of the
parameters of a control law. The calibrator can judge whether a particular
combination of parameters leads to a better, worse, or similar closed-loop
performance. Often, the search for the optimal parameters is also subject to
unknown constraints. For example, the vector of calibration parameters must not
lead to closed-loop instability. This paper extends an active preference
learning algorithm introduced recently by the authors to handle unknown
constraints. The proposed method, called C-GLISp, looks for an optimizer of the
problem only based on preferences expressed on pairs of candidate vectors, and
on whether a given vector is reported feasible and/or satisfactory. C-GLISp
learns a surrogate of the underlying objective function based on the expressed
preferences, and a surrogate of the probability that a sample is feasible
and/or satisfactory based on whether each of the tested vectors was judged as
such. The surrogate functions are used iteratively to propose a new candidate
vector to test and judge. Numerical benchmarks and a semi-automated control
calibration task demonstrate the effectiveness of C-GLISp, showing that it can
reach near-optimal solutions within a small number of iterations.

is amplitude interferometry, which includes conventional optical telescopes and
Very Large Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). The second type is intensity
interferometry, which relies on Hanbury Brown and Twiss-type measurements. At
optical frequencies, where direct phase measurements are impossible, amplitude
interferometry has an effective numerical aperture that is limited by the
distance from which photons can coherently interfere. Intensity interferometry,
on the other hand, correlates only photon fluxes and can thus support much
larger numerical apertures, but suffers from a reduced signal due to the low
average photon number per mode in thermal light. It has hitherto not been clear
which method is superior under realistic conditions. Here, we give a
comparative analysis of the performance of amplitude and intensity
interferometry, and we relate this to the fundamental resolution limit that can
be achieved in any physical measurement. Using the benchmark problem of
determining the separation between two distant thermal point sources, e.g., two
adjacent stars, we give a short tutorial on optimal estimation theory and apply
it to stellar interferometry. We find that for very small angular separations
the large baseline achievable in intensity interferometry can more than
compensate for the reduced signal strength. We also explore options for
practical implementations of Very Large Baseline Intensity Interferometry
(VLBII).

optical flow in gray and RGB-valued image sequences. A crucial assumption in
these models is that pixel-values do not change under transformations.
Nowadays, modern image acquisition techniques such as electron backscatter
tomography (EBSD), which is used in material sciences, can capture images with
values in nonlinear spaces. Here, the image values belong to the quotient space
$\text{SO}(3)/ \mathcal S$ of the special orthogonal group modulo the discrete
symmetry group of the crystal. For such data, the assumption that pixel-values
remain unchanged under transformations appears to be no longer valid. Hence, we
propose a variational model for determining the optical flow in
$\text{SO}(3)/\mathcal S$-valued image sequences, taking the dependence of
pixel-values on the transformation into account. More precisely, the data is
transformed according to the rotation part in the polar decomposition of the
Jacobian of the transformation. To model non-smooth transformations without
obtaining so-called staircasing effects, we propose to use a total generalized
variation like prior. Then, we prove existence of a minimizer for our model and
explain how it can be discretized and minimized by a primal-dual algorithm.
Numerical examples illustrate the performance of our method.

the growing need to also sense nearby targets, the far-field assumption may
become invalid. This paper studies radar sensing with extremely large-scale

developed. Furthermore, new closed-form expressions of the sensing

obtained. For XL-phased-array radar with optimal power allocation, the SNR
increases with M and N with diminishing returns, governed by new parameters
called the transmit and receive angular spans. On the other hand, for XL-MIMO

where both the upper and the bottom time series are coherently revised. (3) As
the LCC procedure does not guarantee the non-negativity of the reconciled
forecasts, we argue that - when non-negativity is a natural attribute of the
variables to be forecast - its interpretation as an unbiased top-down
reconciliation procedure leaves room for some doubts. (4) The new procedures
are used in a forecasting experiment on the classical Australian Tourism Demand
(Visitor Nights) dataset. Due to the crucial role played by the (possibly
different) models used to compute the base forecasts, we re-interpret the CCC
reconciliation of Hollyman et al. (2021) as a forecast pooling approach,
showing that accuracy improvement may be gained by adopting a simple forecast
averaging strategy.

selecting these subgoals is computationally costly. What algorithms might
enable us to reap the benefits of planning using subgoals while minimizing the
computational overhead of selecting them? We propose visual scoping, a strategy
that interleaves planning and acting by alternately defining a spatial region
as the next subgoal and selecting actions to achieve it. We evaluated our
visual scoping algorithm on a variety of physical assembly problems against two
baselines: planning all subgoals in advance and planning without subgoals. We
found that visual scoping achieves comparable task performance to the subgoal

monitoring campaign of two luminous quasars, PG~0923+201 and PG~1001+291, both
located at the high-luminosity end of the broad-line region (BLR)
size-luminosity relation with optical luminosities above $10^{45}~{\rm
erg~s^{-1}}$. PG~0923+201 is for the first time monitored, and PG~1001+291 was
previously monitored but our campaign has a much longer temporal baseline. We
detect time lags of variations of the broad H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, Fe {\sc ii}
lines with respect to those of the 5100~{\AA} continuum. The velocity-resolved
delay map of H$\beta$ in PG~0923+201 indicates a complicated structure with a
mix of Keplerian disk-like motion and outflow, and the map of H$\beta$ in
PG~1001+291 shows a signature of Keplerian disk-like motion. Assuming a virial
factor of $f_{\rm BLR}=1$ and FWHM line widths, we measure the black hole mass
to be $118_{-16}^{+11}\times 10^7 M_{\odot}$ for PG~0923+201 and
$3.33_{-0.54}^{+0.62}\times 10^7 M_{\odot}$ for PG~1001+291. Their respective
accretion rates are estimated to be $0.21_{-0.07}^{+0.06} \times L_{\rm
Edd}\,c^{-2}$ and $679_{-227}^{+259}\times L_{\rm Edd}\,c^{-2}$, indicating
that PG~0923+201 is a sub-Eddington accretor and PG~1001+291 is a
super-Eddington accretor. While the H$\beta$ time lag of PG~0923+201 agrees
with the size-luminosity relation, the time lag of PG~1001+291 shows a
significant deviation, confirming that in high-luminosity AGN the BLR size
depends on both luminosity and Eddington ratio. Black hole mass estimates from
single AGN spectra will be over-estimated at high luminosities and redshifts if
this effect is not taken into account.

Language Processing (NLP) and achieved great success. However, it has not been
fully explored in visual self-supervised learning. Meanwhile, previous methods
only consider the high-level feature and learning representation from a global
perspective, which may fail to transfer to the downstream dense prediction
tasks focusing on local features. In this paper, we present a novel Masked
Self-supervised Transformer approach named MST, which can explicitly capture
the local context of an image while preserving the global semantic information.
Specifically, inspired by the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) in NLP, we propose
a masked token strategy based on the multi-head self-attention map, which
dynamically masks some tokens of local patches without damaging the crucial
structure for self-supervised learning. More importantly, the masked tokens
together with the remaining tokens are further recovered by a global image
decoder, which preserves the spatial information of the image and is more
friendly to the downstream dense prediction tasks. The experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method.
For instance, MST achieves Top-1 accuracy of 76.9% with DeiT-S only using
300-epoch pre-training by linear evaluation, which outperforms supervised
methods with the same epoch by 0.4% and its comparable variant DINO by 1.0\%.
For dense prediction tasks, MST also achieves 42.7% mAP on MS COCO object
detection and 74.04% mIoU on Cityscapes segmentation only with 100-epoch
pre-training.

a variety of tasks. Some adversarial algorithms perturb all the pixels in the
image minimally for the image classification task in image classification. In
contrast, some algorithms perturb few pixels strongly. However, very little
information is available regarding why these adversarial samples so diverse
from each other exist. Recently, Vargas et al. showed that the existence of
these adversarial samples might be due to conflicting saliency within the
neural network. We test this hypothesis of conflicting saliency by analysing
the Saliency Maps (SM) and Gradient-weighted Class Activation Maps (Grad-CAM)
of original and few different types of adversarial samples. We also analyse how
different adversarial samples distort the attention of the neural network
compared to original samples. We show that in the case of Pixel Attack,
perturbed pixels either calls the network attention to themselves or divert the
attention from them. Simultaneously, the Projected Gradient Descent Attack
perturbs pixels so that intermediate layers inside the neural network lose
attention for the correct class. We also show that both attacks affect the
saliency map and activation maps differently. Thus, shedding light on why some
defences successful against some attacks remain vulnerable against other
attacks. We hope that this analysis will improve understanding of the existence
and the effect of adversarial samples and enable the community to develop more
robust neural networks.

physical point is triggered by big imbalance among three fundamental quantities
essential for the QCD vacuum structure: susceptibility functions for the chiral
symmetry, axial symmetry, and the topological charge. The balance, dobbed the
QCD trilemma, is unavoidably violated when one of the magnitudes among them is
highly dominated, or suppressed. Based on a three-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio
model, we explicitly evaluate the amount of violation of the QCD trilemma at
physical point, and show that the violation takes place not only at vacuum, but
even in a whole temperature regime including the chiral crossover epoch. This
work confirms and extends the suggestion recently reported from lattice QCD
with 2 flavors on dominance of the axial and topological susceptibilities left
in the chiral susceptibility at high temperatures. It turns out that the
imbalance is essentially due to the flavor symmetry violation of the lightest
three flavors, and the flavor breaking specifically brings enhancement of the
axial anomaly contribution in the chiral order parameter, while the the
strength of the axial breaking and the transition rate of the topological
charge are fairly insensitive to the flavor symmetry. The violation of QCD
trilemma and its flavor dependence can be tested by lattice simulations with 2
+ 1 flavors in the future, and would also give a new guiding principle to
explore the flavor dependence of the chiral phase transition, such as the
Columbia plot, including possible extension with external fields.

gravity on the propagation of gravitational waves (GWs) through cosmological
distances while typically assuming their emission from fully screened regions

impact of screening mechanisms on the inspiral GW waveforms from compact

corrections to a fully screened emission to first PN order in the near zone and
we also compute the modifications in the unscreened radiation zone to second PN
order. For a concrete example, we apply our results to a cubic Galileon model.
The resulting GW amplitude from a binary black hole inspiral deviate from its
GR counterpart at most by one part in $10^{2}$ for the modifications in the
radiation zone and at most one part in $10^{11}$ due to next-order corrections
to the fully screened near zone. We expect such modifications to be
undetectable by the current generation of GW detectors, but the deviation is
not so small as to remain undetectable in future experiments.

provide a microscopic derivation of zero frequency noise through a quantum dot
based on a tight binding Hamiltonian, which constitutes a generalization of the
pioneering work of Caroli et al. for the current obtained in the context of the
Keldysh formalism. For a single level quantum dot, the obtained transmission
coefficient entering the scattering formula for the non-equilibrium noise
corresponds to a Breit-Wigner resonance. We compute the delta-$T$ noise as a
function of the dot level position, and of the dot level width, in the
Breit-Wigner case, for two relevant situations which were considered recently
in two separate experiments. In the regime where the two reservoir temperatures
are comparable, our gradient expansion shows that the delta-$T$ noise is
dominated by its quadratic contribution, and is minimal close to resonance. In
the opposite regime where one reservoir is much colder, the gradient expansion
fails and we find the noise to be typically linear in temperature before
saturating. In both situations, we conclude with a short discussion of the case
where both a voltage bias and a temperature gradient are present, in order to

solution requires selecting appropriate hardware automatically. This can be
framed as a multi-objective optimization problem: there is not a single best
hardware configuration but a set of optimal ones achieving different trade-offs
between cost and runtime. In practice, some choices may be overly costly or
take days to train. To lift this burden, we adopt a multi-objective approach
that selects and adapts the hardware configuration automatically alongside
neural architectures and their hyperparameters. Our method builds on Hyperband
and extends it in two ways. First, we replace the stopping rule used in
Hyperband by a non-dominated sorting rule to preemptively stop unpromising
configurations. Second, we leverage hyperparameter evaluations from related
tasks via transfer learning by building a probabilistic estimate of the Pareto
front that finds promising configurations more efficiently than random search.
We show in extensive NAS and HPO experiments that both ingredients bring
significant speed-ups and cost savings, with little to no impact on accuracy.
In three benchmarks where hardware is selected in addition to hyperparameters,
we obtain runtime and cost reductions of at least 5.8x and 8.8x, respectively.
Furthermore, when applying our multi-objective method to the tuning of
hyperparameters only, we obtain a 10\% improvement in runtime while maintaining

We take steps towards making it more realistic by addressing the following

set annotations, causing researchers must compare their method with other SOTAs
on a self-divided test set (from the training set). Training other methods lead
to an increase in workload and different researchers divide different datasets,
resulting there is no unified benchmark to compare the performance of different
algorithms. Secondly, these datasets also have other shortcomings, e.g., too
many similar images or incomplete labels. Towards these challenges we introduce
a dataset, Detecting Underwater Objects (DUO), and a corresponding benchmark,
based on the collection and re-annotation of all relevant datasets. DUO
contains a collection of diverse underwater images with more rational
annotations. The corresponding benchmark provides indicators of both efficiency

protection. Privacy policies contain privacy-related requirements about how the
personal data of individuals will be handled by an organization or a software
system (e.g., a web service or an app). In Europe, privacy policies are subject
to compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). A
prerequisite for GDPR compliance checking is to verify whether the content of a
privacy policy is complete according to the provisions of GDPR. Incomplete
privacy policies might result in large fines on violating organization as well
as incomplete privacy-related software specifications. Manual completeness
checking is both time-consuming and error-prone. In this paper, we propose
AI-based automation for the completeness checking of privacy policies. Through
systematic qualitative methods, we first build two artifacts to characterize
the privacy-related provisions of GDPR, namely a conceptual model and a set of
completeness criteria. Then, we develop an automated solution on top of these
artifacts by leveraging a combination of natural language processing and
supervised machine learning. Specifically, we identify the GDPR-relevant
information content in privacy policies and subsequently check them against the
completeness criteria. To evaluate our approach, we collected 234 real privacy
policies from the fund industry. Over a set of 48 unseen privacy policies, our
approach detected 300 of the total of 334 violations of some completeness
criteria correctly, while producing 23 false positives. The approach thus has a

  Knowledge Distillation","Accepted by ACL 2021",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, knowledge distillation (KD) has shown great success in BERT
compression. Instead of only learning from the teacher's soft label as in
conventional KD, researchers find that the rich information contained in the
hidden layers of BERT is conducive to the student's performance. To better
exploit the hidden knowledge, a common practice is to force the student to
deeply mimic the teacher's hidden states of all the tokens in a layer-wise
manner. In this paper, however, we observe that although distilling the
teacher's hidden state knowledge (HSK) is helpful, the performance gain
(marginal utility) diminishes quickly as more HSK is distilled. To understand
this effect, we conduct a series of analysis. Specifically, we divide the HSK
of BERT into three dimensions, namely depth, length and width. We first
investigate a variety of strategies to extract crucial knowledge for each
single dimension and then jointly compress the three dimensions. In this way,
we show that 1) the student's performance can be improved by extracting and
distilling the crucial HSK, and 2) using a tiny fraction of HSK can achieve the
same performance as extensive HSK distillation. Based on the second finding, we
further propose an efficient KD paradigm to compress BERT, which does not
require loading the teacher during the training of student. For two kinds of

of state) analysis of the neutrino emissivity due to triplet neutron pairing in
neutron star cores. We find that the integrated neutrino luminosity of the
Cooper Pair Formation (CPF) process can be written as a product of two factors.
The first factor depends on the neutron star mass, radius and maximal critical
temperature of neutron pairing in the core, $T_{Cn \mathrm{max}}$, but not on
the particular superfluidity model; it can be expressed by an analytical
formula valid for many nucleon equations of state. The second factor depends on
the shape of the critical temperature profile within the star, the ratio of the
temperature $T$ to $T_{Cn \mathrm{max}}$, but not on the maximal critical
temperature itself. While this second factor depends on the superfluidity
model, it obeys several model-independent constraints. This property allows one
to analyse the thermal evolution of neutron stars with superfluid cores without
relying on a specific model of their interiors. The constructed expressions
allow us to perform a self-consistent analysis of spectral data and neutron
star cooling theory. We apply these findings to the cooling neutron star in the
Cassiopeia A supernova remnant using 14 sets of observations taken over 19
years. We constrain $T_{Cn\mathrm{max}}$ to the range of $ (5-10)\times 10^8$
K. This value depends weakly on the equation of state and superfluidity model,
and will not change much if cooling is slower than the current data suggest. We
also constrain the overall efficiency of the CPF neutrino luminosity.

already established, although not completely understood. The influence of the
$^{10}$C Brunnian structure is less known.
  Purpose: To investigate the influence of the cluster configuration of
$^{10}$C on the elastic scattering at an energy close to the Coulomb barrier.
  Methods: We present experimental data for the elastic scattering of the
$^{10}$C+$^{208}$Pb system at $E_{\rm lab}$ = 66 MeV. The data are compared to
the three- and the four-body continuum-discretized coupled-channels
calculations assuming $^9$B+$p$, $^6$Be+$\alpha$ and $^8$Be+$p$+$p$
configurations.
  Results: The experimental angular distribution of the cross sections shows
the suppression of the Fresnel peak that is reasonably well reproduced by the
continuum-discretized coupled-channels calculations. However, the calculations
underestimate the cross sections at backward angles. Couplings to continuum
states represent a small effect.
  Conclusions: The cluster configurations of $^{10}$C assumed in the present
work are able to describe some of the features of the data. In order to explain
the data at backward angles, experimental data for the breakup and an extension
of theoretical formalism towards a four-body cluster seem to be in need to
reproduce the measured angular distribution.

interacting variables. The causal structure underlying each such model is
naturally represented by a directed graph whose edges indicate for each
variable which other variables it causally depends upon. Under a number of
different model assumptions, it has been shown that this causal graph and, thus
also, causal effects are identifiable from mere observational data. For these
models, practical algorithms have been devised to learn the graph. Moreover,
when the graph is known, standard techniques may be used to give estimates and
confidence intervals for causal effects. We argue, however, that a two-step
method that first learns a graph and then treats the graph as known yields
confidence intervals that are overly optimistic and can drastically fail to
account for the uncertain causal structure. To address this issue we lay out a
framework based on test inversion that allows us to give confidence regions for
total causal effects that capture both sources of uncertainty: causal structure
and numerical size of nonzero effects. Our ideas are developed in the context
of bivariate linear causal models with homoscedastic errors, but as we
exemplify they are generalizable to larger systems as well as other settings
such as, in particular, linear non-Gaussian models.

Galactic Black Hole Binaries, their evidence in the super-Eddington regime

presence of a recurrent evolutionary cycle in two archetypal ULXs: Holmberg II
X-1 and NGC 5204 X-1. Here we build on our previous work and exploit the
long-term high-cadence monitoring of Swift-XRT in order to provide evidence of
the evolutionary cycle in these two sources and investigate the main physical
parameters inducing their spectral transitions. We study the long-term
evolution of both sources using hardness-intensity diagrams (HID) and by means
of Lomb-Scargle periodograms and Gaussian processes modelling to look for
periodic variability. We show that both sources follow a recurrent evolutionary
pattern in the HID that can be characterized by the hard ultraluminous (HUL)
and soft ultraluminous (SUL) spectral regimes, and a third state with
characteristics similar to the supersoft ultraluminous (SSUL) state. The
transitions between the soft states seem aperiodic, as revealed by timing
analysis of the light curve of Holmberg II X-1, albeit further investigation is
warranted. The light curve of NGC 5204 X-1 shows a periodicity of $\sim$ 200
days, possibly associated with the duration of the evolutionary cycle. We
support a scenario in which the spectral changes from HUL to SUL are due to a
periodic increase of the mass-transfer rate and subsequent narrowing of the
opening angle of the supercritical funnel. The narrower funnel, combined with
stochastic variability imprinted by the wind, might explain the SUL--SSUL
spectral changes.

the effects of thermal misbalance caused by longitudinal plasma motions induced
by shear Alfv\'en waves. We show that thermal misbalance leads to appearance of
exponential bulk flows, which itself modifies the Alfv\'en induced plasma
motions. In the case of sinusoidal Alfv\'en waves, we show how the amplitude
and phase shift of induced longitudinal motions gain dependence on the Alfv\'en
wave frequency while shedding light on its functionality. This feature has been
investigated analytically in application to coronal conditions. We also
consider the evolution of longitudinal plasma motions induced by the shear
sinusoidal Alfv\'en wave by numerical methods before comparing the results
obtained with our presented analytical predictions to justify the model under
consideration in the present study.

momentum transfer produce quarks and gluons (known as partons) whose evolution
is governed by the strong force, as described by the theory of quantum
chromodynamics (QCD). These partons subsequently emit further partons in a
process that can be described as a parton shower which culminates in the
formation of detectable hadrons. Studying the pattern of the parton shower is
one of the key experimental tools for testing QCD. This pattern is expected to
depend on the mass of the initiating parton, through a phenomenon known as the
dead-cone effect, which predicts a suppression of the gluon spectrum emitted by
a heavy quark of mass $m_{\rm{Q}}$ and energy $E$, within a cone of angular
size $m_{\rm{Q}}$/$E$ around the emitter. Previously, a direct observation of
the dead-cone effect in QCD had not been possible, owing to the challenge of
reconstructing the cascading quarks and gluons from the experimentally
accessible hadrons. We report the direct observation of the QCD dead cone by
using new iterative declustering techniques to reconstruct the parton shower of
charm quarks. This result confirms a fundamental feature of QCD. Furthermore,
the measurement of a dead-cone angle constitutes a direct experimental
observation of the non-zero mass of the charm quark, which is a fundamental
constant in the standard model of particle physics.

we design two Probabilistic Codebook (PCB) techniques of prioritized beams. In
the first one, the PCBs are built leveraging past collected traffic

information coming from the angular probability distribution allows designing
non-uniform codebook quantization, reducing the degradation of the performances

$P\simeq3.17\rm~ms$. Harbored in a binary with an orbital period $P_{\rm

the MSP and the WD were determined to be $1.83\rm~M_\odot$ and
$0.266\rm~M_\odot$, respectively. Specially, its orbital eccentricity is
$e\simeq0.134$, which is challenging the recycling model of MSPs. Assuming that
the neutron star in a binary may collapse to a strange star when its mass
reaches a critical limit, we propose a phase transition (PT) scenario to
account for the origin of the system. The sudden mass loss and the kick induced
by asymmetric collapse during the PT may result in the orbital eccentricity. If
the PT event takes place after the mass transfer ceases, the eccentric orbit
can not be re-circularized in the Hubble time. Aiming at the masses of both
components, we simulate the evolution of the progenitor of PSR J$1946+3417$ via
\texttt{MESA}. The simulations show that a NS / main sequence star binary with

evolve into a binary consisting of a $2.0\rm~M_\odot$ MSP and a

gravitational mass loss fraction during PT is $10\%$, we simulate the effect of
PT via the kick program of \texttt{BSE} with a velocity of $\sigma_{\rm

we report self-oscillation and synchronization transitions in a

combining precision-desktop experiments of elastically coupled self-propelled

demonstrate that the dynamics of single chain follows a Hopf bifurcation. We
show that this instability is controlled by a single non-dimensional
elasto-active number that quantifies the interplay between activity and
elasticity. Finally, we demonstrate that pairs of coupled elasto-active chains
can undergo a synchronization transition: the oscillations phases of both
chains lock when the coupling link is sufficiently stiff. Beyond the canonical
case considered here, we anticipate our work to open avenues for the

e.g., on the finite element method, are unaffordable whenever fluid flows must
be simulated in almost real-time. Reduced order models (ROMs) relying, e.g., on
proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) provide reliable approximations to
parameter-dependent fluid dynamics problems in rapid times. However, they might
require expensive hyper-reduction strategies for handling parameterized
nonlinear terms, and enriched reduced spaces (or Petrov-Galerkin projections)
if a mixed velocity-pressure formulation is considered, possibly hampering the
evaluation of reliable solutions in real-time. Dealing with fluid-structure
interactions entails even higher difficulties. The proposed deep learning
(DL)-based ROMs overcome all these limitations by learning in a non-intrusive
way both the nonlinear trial manifold and the reduced dynamics. To do so, they
rely on deep neural networks, after performing a former dimensionality
reduction through POD enhancing their training times substantially. The
resulting POD-DL-ROMs are shown to provide accurate results in almost real-time

documents. The most popular examples of such documents include analyst reports
and economic news, the analysis of which is frequently used to capture the
trends in market sentiments. On the other hand, the significance of the role
sentiment analysis plays in the financial domain has given rise to the efforts
to construct a financial domain-specific sentiment lexicon. Sentiment lexicons
lend a hand for solving various text mining tasks, such as unsupervised
classification of text data, while alleviating the arduous human labor required
for manual labeling. One of the challenges in the construction of an effective
sentiment lexicon is that the semantic orientation of a word may change
depending on the context in which it appears. For instance, the word ``profit""
usually conveys positive sentiments; however, when the word is juxtaposed with
another word ``decrease,"" the sentiment associated with the phrase ``profit
decreases"" now becomes negative. Hence, the sentiment of a given word may shift
as one begins to consider the context surrounding the word. In this paper, we
address this issue by incorporating context when building sentiment lexicon
from a given corpus. Specifically, we construct a lexicon named Senti-DD for
the Sentiment lexicon composed of Direction-Dependent words, which expresses
each term a pair of a directional word and a direction-dependent word.
Experiment results show that higher classification performance is achieved with
Senti-DD, proving the effectiveness of our method for automatically
constructing a context-aware sentiment lexicon in the financial domain.

long-standing goal of condensed matter physics. Among them, half-metals are
spin-polarized conductors that are essential for realizing room-temperature
spin current sources. However, typical half-metals are low-temperature phases
whose spin polarization rapidly deteriorates with temperature increase. Here,
we first show that a low-temperature insulator with an unequal charge gap for
the two spin channels can arise from competing Mott and band insulating
tendencies. We establish that thermal fluctuations can drive this insulator to
a half-metal through a first-order phase transition by closing the charge gap
for one spin channel. This half-metal has 100% spin polarization at the onset
temperature of metallization. Further, varying the strength of electron
repulsion can enhance the onset temperature while preserving spin polarization.
We outline experimental scenarios for realizing this tunable finite temperature
half-metal.

birefringence, which results in a frequency-dependent rotation of the
polarization plane of linearly polarized light from distant sources. In this
paper, we try to search for a frequency-dependent change of the linear
polarization angle arising from vacuum birefringence in the spectropolarimetric
data of astrophysical sources. We collect five blazars with multiwavelength
polarization measurements in different optical bands $(UBVRI)$. Taking into
account the observed polarization angle contributions from both the intrinsic
polarization angle and the rotation angle induced by LIV, and assuming that the
intrinsic polarization angle is an unknown constant, we obtain new constraints
on LIV by directly fitting the multiwavelength polarimetric data of the five
blazars. Here we show that the birefringence parameter $\eta$ quantifying the
broken degree of Lorentz invariance is limited to be in the range of
$-8.91\times 10^{-7}$ < $\eta$ < $2.93\times10^{-5}$ at the $2\sigma$
confidence level, which is as good as or represents one order of magnitude
improvement over the results previously obtained from ultraviolet/optical

  admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1903.05048",,,,"cs.CG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Orthogonal drawings, i.e., embeddings of graphs into grids, are a classic
topic in Graph Drawing. Often the goal is to find a drawing that minimizes the
number of bends on the edges. A key ingredient for bend minimization algorithms
is the existence of an orthogonal representation that describes such drawings
combinatorially by only listing the angles between the edges around each vertex
and the directions of bends on the edges, but neglecting any kind of geometric
information such as vertex coordinates or edge lengths.
  We generalize this idea to ortho-radial representations of ortho-radial
drawings, which are embeddings into an ortho-radial grid, whose gridlines are
concentric circles around the origin and straight-line spokes emanating from
the origin but excluding the origin itself. Unlike the orthogonal case, there
exist ortho-radial representations that do not admit a corresponding drawing,
for example so-called strictly monotone cycles. An ortho-radial drawing is
called valid if it does not contain a strictly monotone cycle. Our first result
is that an ortho-radial representation admits a corresponding drawing if and
only if it is valid. Previously such a characterization was only known for
ortho-radial drawings of paths, cycles, and theta graphs, and in the special
case of rectangular drawings of cubic graphs, where the contour of each face is
required to be a rectangle. Further, we give a quadratic-time algorithm that
tests for an ortho-radial representation whether it is valid, and we show how
to draw a valid ortho-radial representation in the same running time.
  Altogether, this reduces the problem of computing a minimum-bend ortho-radial
drawing to the task of computing a valid ortho-radial representation with the
minimum number of bends, and hence establishes an ortho-radial analogue of the
topology-shape-metrics framework for planar orthogonal drawings by Tamassia.

assessment of image analysis algorithms given a specific task. Segmentation is
so far the most widely investigated medical image processing task, but the
various segmentation challenges have typically been organized in isolation,
such that algorithm development was driven by the need to tackle a single
specific clinical problem. We hypothesized that a method capable of performing
well on multiple tasks will generalize well to a previously unseen task and
potentially outperform a custom-designed solution. To investigate the
hypothesis, we organized the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) - a
biomedical image analysis challenge, in which algorithms compete in a multitude
of both tasks and modalities. The underlying data set was designed to explore
the axis of difficulties typically encountered when dealing with medical
images, such as small data sets, unbalanced labels, multi-site data and small
objects. The MSD challenge confirmed that algorithms with a consistent good
performance on a set of tasks preserved their good average performance on a
different set of previously unseen tasks. Moreover, by monitoring the MSD
winner for two years, we found that this algorithm continued generalizing well
to a wide range of other clinical problems, further confirming our hypothesis.
Three main conclusions can be drawn from this study: (1) state-of-the-art image
segmentation algorithms are mature, accurate, and generalize well when
retrained on unseen tasks; (2) consistent algorithmic performance across
multiple tasks is a strong surrogate of algorithmic generalizability; (3) the
training of accurate AI segmentation models is now commoditized to non AI

As the process should be socially and economically profitable, the task of

that leverage the generative power of a pre-trained StyleGAN. To successfully
edit an image this way, one must first project (or invert) the image into the
pre-trained generator's domain. As it turns out, however, StyleGAN's latent
space induces an inherent tradeoff between distortion and editability, i.e.
between maintaining the original appearance and convincingly altering some of
its attributes. Practically, this means it is still challenging to apply
ID-preserving facial latent-space editing to faces which are out of the
generator's domain. In this paper, we present an approach to bridge this gap.
Our technique slightly alters the generator, so that an out-of-domain image is
faithfully mapped into an in-domain latent code. The key idea is pivotal tuning
- a brief training process that preserves the editing quality of an in-domain
latent region, while changing its portrayed identity and appearance. In Pivotal
Tuning Inversion (PTI), an initial inverted latent code serves as a pivot,
around which the generator is fined-tuned. At the same time, a regularization
term keeps nearby identities intact, to locally contain the effect. This
surgical training process ends up altering appearance features that represent
mostly identity, without affecting editing capabilities. We validate our
technique through inversion and editing metrics, and show preferable scores to
state-of-the-art methods. We further qualitatively demonstrate our technique by
applying advanced edits (such as pose, age, or expression) to numerous images
of well-known and recognizable identities. Finally, we demonstrate resilience
to harder cases, including heavy make-up, elaborate hairstyles and/or headwear,
which otherwise could not have been successfully inverted and edited by
state-of-the-art methods.

distribution of the energy density, and the correspondingly related
distribution of the neutrino emissivity that is thus again proportional to the
energy density; radius of such extremely compact objects can overcome the
photosphere of the external Schwarzschild spacetime. In dependence on the
parameters of the Tolman VII spacetimes, we determine the ""local"" and ""global""

structurally constrained machine learning applications. However, one major
limitation of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm is the slow local convergence property
due to the zig-zagging behavior. We observe that this zig-zagging phenomenon
can be viewed as an artifact of discretization, as when the method is viewed as
an Euler discretization of a continuous time flow, that flow does not zig-zag.
For this reason, we propose multistep Frank-Wolfe variants based on
discretizations of the same flow whose truncation errors decay as
$O(\Delta^p)$, where $p$ is the method's order. This strategy ""stabilizes"" the
method, and allows tools like line search and momentum to have more benefit.
However, in terms of a convergence rate, our result is ultimately negative,
suggesting that no Runge-Kutta-type discretization scheme can achieve a better

is a clear trend in modern civil engineering applications. Most infrastructure
is made of concrete and cracks reveal degradation of the structural integrity
of the facilities, which can lead to extreme structural failures. There are
many approaches to overcome the difficulties in image-based crack detection,
ranging from the pre-processing of the input image to the proper adjustment of
efficient classifiers, passing through the essential feature selection step.
This paper is related to the process of constructing features from images to
allow a classifier to find the boundaries between images with and without
cracks. The most common approaches to feature extraction are the convolutional
techniques to extract relevant positional information from images and the
filters for edge detection or background removal. Here we apply hashing
techniques for the first time used for features extraction in this problem. The
study of the classification capacity of hashes is carried out by comparing 5
different hash algorithms, 2 of which are based on wavelets. The effect of
applying the z-transform on the images before calculating the hashes was also
studied, which totals the study of 10 new features for this problem. A
comparative study of 17 different algorithms from the scikit-learn library was
carried out. The results show that 9 of the 10 features are relevant to the
problem, as well as that the accuracy of the classifiers varied between 0.697
for the Naive-Bayes Gaussian classifier and 0.99 for the Random Forest (RF)
classifier. The feature extraction algorithm developed in this work and the RF
classifier algorithm is suitable for embedded applications, for example in
inspection drones, as long as they are highly accurate and computationally

takes the first step towards systematically studying CULPRITWARE and its

comparing them with benign apps and malware. The result shows that CULPRITWARE
have unique features, e.g., the usage of app generators (25.27%) deviates from
that of benign apps (5.08%) and malware (0.43%). Such a discrepancy can be used
to distinguish CULPRITWARE from benign apps and malware. Then we understand the
structure of the ecosystem by revealing the four participating entities (i.e.,

reveal the characteristics of the ecosystem by studying the participating

are useful tools to identify fundamental parameters that affect solar cell
operation. Techniques such as capacitance-voltage (CV), Mott-Schottky analysis
and thermal admittance spectroscopy (TAS) measurements are therefore frequently
employed to obtain relevant parameters of the perovskite absorber layer in
perovskite solar cells. However, state-of-the-art perovskite solar cells employ
thin electron and hole transport layers that improve contact selectivity. These
selective contacts are often quite resistive in nature, which implies that
their capacitances will contribute to the total capacitance and thereby affect
the extraction of the capacitance of the perovskite layer. Based on this
premise, we develop a simple multilayer model that considers the perovskite
solar cell as a series connection of the geometric capacitance of each layer in
parallel with their voltage-dependent resistances. Analysis of this model
yields fundamental limits to the resolution of spatial doping profiles and
minimum values of doping/trap densities, built-in voltages and activation
energies. We observe that most of the experimental
capacitance-voltage-frequency-temperature data, calculated doping/trap
densities and activation energies reported in literature are within these
cut-off values derived, indicating that the capacitance response of the
perovskite solar cell is indeed strongly affected by the capacitance of its
selective contacts.

ladder diagrams in W can greatly reduce the band gap overestimation of
RPA-based QSGW. The resultant discrepency of the calculated band gap in this

semiconductors to the strongly correlated systems NiO and CoO. Results for
systems where the RPA-based QSGW band gap is larger than expected are

obtain a 'least bad' policy than just a 'No', where 'least bad' is
characterized by some numerical value indicating the extent to which the policy
violates the base authorization relation and constraints. Accordingly, we
introduce the Valued APEP, which returns an authorization policy of minimum

from human speech. However, the prosody of those systems is generally flatter
than natural speech, producing samples with low expressiveness. Disentanglement
of speaker id and prosody is crucial in text-to-speech systems to improve on
naturalness and produce more variable syntheses. This paper proposes a new
neural text-to-speech model that approaches the disentanglement problem by
conditioning a Tacotron2-like architecture on flow-normalized speaker
embeddings, and by substituting the reference encoder with a new learned latent
distribution responsible for modeling the intra-sentence variability due to the
prosody. By removing the reference encoder dependency, the speaker-leakage
problem typically happening in this kind of systems disappears, producing more
distinctive syntheses at inference time. The new model achieves significantly
higher prosody variance than the baseline in a set of quantitative prosody
features, as well as higher speaker distinctiveness, without decreasing the

embeddings enable much richer speaker interpolations, substantially improving
the distinctiveness of the new interpolated speakers.

research institutions, publishers, and funding organizations. Detection
approaches proposed so far analyze lexical, syntactical, and semantic text
similarity. These approaches find copied, moderately reworded, and literally
translated text. However, reliably detecting disguised plagiarism, such as
strong paraphrases, sense-for-sense translations, and the reuse of non-textual
content and ideas, is an open research problem.
  The thesis addresses this problem by proposing plagiarism detection
approaches that implement a different concept: analyzing non-textual content in
academic documents, specifically citations, images, and mathematical content.
  To validate the effectiveness of the proposed detection approaches, the
thesis presents five evaluations that use real cases of academic plagiarism and
exploratory searches for unknown cases.
  The evaluation results show that non-textual content elements contain a high
degree of semantic information, are language-independent, and largely immutable
to the alterations that authors typically perform to conceal plagiarism.
Analyzing non-textual content complements text-based detection approaches and
increases the detection effectiveness, particularly for disguised forms of
academic plagiarism.
  To demonstrate the benefit of combining non-textual and text-based detection
methods, the thesis describes the first plagiarism detection system that
integrates the analysis of citation-based, image-based, math-based, and
text-based document similarity. The system's user interface employs
visualizations that significantly reduce the effort and time users must invest
in examining content similarity.

resonant beam simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (RB-SWIPT)
system, which utilizes a gain medium and two retro-reflecting surfaces to
enhance and retro-reflect energy, and allows devices to recharge their
batteries and exchange information from the resonant beam wirelessly. To reveal
the SWIPT mechanism and evaluate the SWIPT performance, we establish an
analytical end-to-end (E2E) transmission model based on a modular approach and
the electromagnetic field propagation. Then, the intra-cavity power intensity
distribution, transmission loss, output power, and E2E efficiency can be
obtained. The numerical evaluation illustrates that the exemplary RB-SWIPT
system can provide about 4.20W electric power and 12.41bps/Hz spectral
efficiency, and shorter transmission distance or larger retro-reflecting
surface size can lead to higher E2E efficiency. The RB-SWIPT presents a new way
for high-power, long-range WPT, and high-rate communication.

all theoretical studies have focused on solar-like stars. We present an
investigation into stellar prominences around rapidly rotating young M-dwarfs.
We have extrapolated the magnetic field in the corona from Zeeman-Doppler maps
and determined the sites of mechanical stability where prominences may form. We
analyse the prominence mass that could be supported and the latitude range over
which this material is distributed. We find that for these maps, much of this
prominence mass may be invisible to observation - typically <1\% transits the
stellar disc. On the rapidly-rotating M-dwarf V374 Peg (P$_{\rm rot}$ = 0.45
days) where prominences have been observed, we find the visible prominence mass
to be around only 10\% of the total mass supported. The mass loss rate per unit
area for prominences scales with the X-ray surface flux as $\dot{M}/A \propto$
$F_X^{1.32}$ which is very close to the observationally-derived value for
stellar winds. This suggests that prominence ejection may contribute
significantly to the overall stellar wind loss and spin down. A planet in an
equatorial orbit in the habitable zone of these stars may experience
intermittent enhancements of the stellar wind due to prominence ejections. On
some stars, this may occur throughout 20\% of the orbit.

shown to produce high fidelity models surpassing the resolution-memory

However, most such approaches focus on representing closed shapes. Unsigned
distance function (UDF) based approaches have been proposed recently as a
promising alternative to represent both open and closed shapes. However, since
the gradients of UDFs vanish on the surface, it is challenging to estimate
local (differential) geometric properties like the normals and tangent planes

are additional challenges in computing these properties efficiently with a
low-memory footprint. This paper presents a novel approach that models such
surfaces using a new class of implicit representations called the closest
surface-point (CSP) representation. We show that CSP allows us to represent
complex surfaces of any topology (open or closed) with high fidelity. It also
allows for accurate and efficient computation of local geometric properties. We
further demonstrate that it leads to efficient implementation of downstream

Furthermore, any set of up to $X$ servers is allowed to share their data.
Previous works considered this collusion a hindrance and the download cost of
the schemes increases with growing $X$. We propose to utilize such linkage
between servers to the user's advantage by allowing servers to cooperate in the
computational task. This leads to a significant gain in the download cost for
the proposed schemes. The gain naturally comes at the cost of increased
communication load between the servers. Hence, the proposed cooperative schemes
can be understood as outsourcing both computational cost and communication
cost. Both information--theoretically secure and computationally secure schemes
are considered, showing that allowing information leakage that is
computationally hard to utilize will lead to further gains.
  The proposed server cooperation is then exemplified for specific secure

of helium abundance has the potential to unravel the chemical evolution of and
within galaxies. In this study, we provide an empirical calibration for the
singly ionized helium abundance: $12+\log_{10}({\rm He}^+/{\rm H}^+)$, based on
the emission line flux ratio He$_{\lambda5876}$/H$\alpha$ from Galactic and
extragalactic HII regions compiled from the literature. Based on this
calibrator, we explore for the first time the helium abundance in a large
sample of HII regions located in galaxies representative of the nearby Universe
from the CALIFA survey. Furthermore, this calibrator allows us to explore the
variations of the helium abundance with respect to the oxygen abundance. The
observed trends are in agreement with a change in the chemical enrichment with
mass/oxygen abundance similar to the one observed due to the inside-out model
in a MW-galaxy (highlighting the connection between resolved and global trends
in galaxies). Our calibrator provides an empirical proxy to estimate the helium
abundance at kpc scales as well as to constrain chemical evolutionary models.

energy-efficient wireless communications, where the secondary backscatter
device (BD) leverages not only the spectrum but also the power of the primary
signals for its own information transmission. In return, the primary
communication link can be enhanced by the additional multipaths created by the
BD. This is known as the mutualism relationship of symbiotic radio. However, as
the backscattering link is much weaker than the direct link due to double
attenuations, the improvement of the primary link brought by one single BD is
extremely limited. To address this issue and enable full mutualism of symbiotic
radio, in this paper, we study symbiotic radio with massive number of BDs. For
symbiotic radio multiple access channel (MAC) with successive interference
cancellation (SIC), we first derive the achievable rate of both the primary and
secondary communications, based on which a receive beamforming optimization
problem is formulated and solved. Furthermore, considering the asymptotic
regime of massive number of BDs, closed-form expressions are derived for the
primary and the secondary communication rates, both of which are shown to be
increasing functions of the number of BDs. This thus demonstrates that the
mutualism relationship of symbiotic radio can be fully exploited with massive
BD access.

simultaneously achieve multi-functional performance and a complex 3D

contradictory stiffness requirements for the folding and for subsequent
load-bearing steps: while a low stiffness is required to allow for the
successful completion of the intended self-folding process, a high stiffness is
needed for the subsequent application of the folded structure as a load-bearing
mechanical metamaterial. The competition between these two requirements
determines the theoretical limits of 4D printed self-folding mechanical
metamaterials, which have not been determined before. Here, we present a
nonlinear analytical model of self-folding bilayer constructs composed of an
active and a passive layer. This finite deformation theoretical model predicts
the curvature of activated bilayers, establishes their stability limits, and
estimates the stiffness of folded bilayers. Combining the three abovementioned
aspects allows for establishing the theoretical stiffness limits of
self-folding bilayers. The optimal combinations of geometrical and mechanical
properties that result in the highest possible stiffness of folded constructs
can then be determined. We compare the predictions of our analytical models
with computational as well as experimental results. Finally, we evaluate the
theoretical stiffness limits of bilayer constructs made using the most common

By eliminating redundant or misleading features from data, the machine learning
model can achieve better performance while reducing the demand on com-puting
resources. Metaheuristic algorithms are mostly used to implement feature
selection such as swarm intelligence algorithms and evolutionary algorithms.
However, they suffer from the disadvantage of relative complexity and slowness.
In this paper, a concise method is proposed for universal feature selection.
The proposed method uses a fusion of the filter method and the wrapper method,
rather than a combination of them. In the method, one-hoting encoding is used
to preprocess the dataset, and random forest is utilized as the classifier. The
proposed method uses normalized frequencies to assign a value to each feature,
which will be used to find the optimal feature subset. Furthermore, we propose
a novel approach to exploit the outputs of mutual information, which allows for
a better starting point for the experiments. Two real-world dataset in the
field of intrusion detection were used to evaluate the proposed method. The
evaluation results show that the proposed method outperformed several
state-of-the-art related works in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F-score

their accuracy depends on maintaining statistical representativeness of their

shrinks confidence intervals but magnifies the impact of survey bias, an
instance of the Big Data Paradox (Meng 2018). Here we demonstrate this paradox
in estimates of first-dose COVID-19 vaccine uptake in US adults:
Delphi-Facebook (about 250,000 responses per week) and Census Household Pulse
(about 75,000 per week). By May 2021, Delphi-Facebook overestimated uptake by
17 percentage points and Census Household Pulse by 14, compared to a benchmark
from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Moreover, their
large data sizes led to minuscule margins of error on the incorrect estimates.
In contrast, an Axios-Ipsos online panel with about 1,000 responses following
survey research best practices (AAPOR) provided reliable estimates and
uncertainty. We decompose observed error using a recent analytic framework to
explain the inaccuracy in the three surveys. We then analyze the implications
for vaccine hesitancy and willingness. We show how a survey of 250,000
respondents can produce an estimate of the population mean that is no more
accurate than an estimate from a simple random sample of size 10. Our central
message is that data quality matters far more than data quantity, and
compensating the former with the latter is a mathematically provable losing

experiments, simulating human behaviour without the associated costs of
recruiting participants. Motivated by the importance of research transparency
and replicability of results, this paper focuses on the challenges of such an
approach. It provides methodological details, recommendations, lessons learned,
and limitations based on our experience of setting up experiments for eight
search engines (including main, news, image and video sections) with hundreds
of virtual agents placed in different regions. We demonstrate the successful
performance of our research infrastructure across multiple data collections,
with diverse experimental designs, and point to different changes and
strategies that improve the quality of the method. We conclude that virtual
agents are a promising venue for monitoring the performance of algorithms
across long periods of time, and we hope that this paper can serve as a basis
for further research in this area.

for control of nonlinear robot manipulators subjected to disturbances and
unavailability of partial information of the desired trajectory. The proposed
differential-cascaded structures rely on infinite differential series to handle
the robustness with respect to time-varying disturbances and the partial
knowledge of the desired trajectories for nonlinear robot manipulators. The
long-standing problem of reliable adaptation in the presence of sustaining
disturbances is solved by the proposed forwardstepping control with
forwardstepping adaptation, and stacked reference dynamics yielding adaptive
differential-cascaded structures have been proposed to facilitate the
forwardstepping adaptation to both the uncertainty of robot dynamics and that
of the frequencies of disturbances. A distinctive point of the proposed
differential-cascaded approach is that the reference dynamics for design and
analysis involve high-order quantities, but via degree-reduction implementation
of the reference dynamics, the control typically involves only the low-order
quantities, thus facilitating its applications to control of most physical
systems. Our result relies on neither the explicit estimation of the
disturbances or derivative and second derivative of the desired position nor
the solutions to linear/nonlinear regulator equations, and the employed
essential element is a differential-cascaded structure governing robot
dynamics.

further cell tracking and behavior analysis, is still challenging in scenarios

propose a novel cell instance segmentation approach based on the well-known
U-Net architecture. To enforce the learning of morphological information per

output is subsequently used to train a top-model. The following top-models are
considered: a three-class (\emph{e.g.,} foreground, background and cell border)
U-net, and a watershed transform. The obtained results suggest a performance
boost over traditional U-Net architectures. This opens an interesting research
line around the idea of injecting morphological information into a fully

perceived safety, where the latter is still under-addressed in the literature.
Investigating perceived safety in human-robot interaction requires a
multidisciplinary perspective. Indeed, perceived safety is often considered as
being associated with several common factors studied in other disciplines,
i.e., comfort, predictability, sense of control, and trust. In this paper, we
investigated the relationship between these factors and perceived safety in
human-robot interaction using subjective and objective measures. We conducted a
two-by-five mixed-subjects design experiment. The five within-subjects
conditions correspond to (1) baseline, and the manipulations of robot behaviors
to stimulate: (2) discomfort, (3) decreased perceived safety, (4) decreased
sense of control and (5) distrust. Twenty-seven young adult participants took
part in the experiments. Participants were asked to answer questionnaires that
measure the manipulated factors after within-subjects conditions. Besides
questionnaire data, we collected objective measures such as videos and
physiological data. The questionnaire results show a correlation between
comfort, sense of control, trust, and perceived safety. We also discuss the
effect of individual human characteristics (such as personality and gender)
that they could be predictors of perceived safety. We used the physiological
signal data and facial affect from videos for estimating perceived safety where
participants' subjective ratings were utilized as labels. The data from
objective measures revealed that the prediction rate was higher from
physiological signal data. This paper can play an important role in the goal of
better understanding perceived safety in human-robot interaction.

many important classes of bivariate distributions, these coefficients take on
non-informative boundary values. We propose a new approach by first considering
global measures based on the surface area of the conditional cumulative

market and price, the two main factors in the competition that leads to
economic efficiency, always exist together. This paper, however, points out the
phenomenon that in some free competitions the two factors are separated hence
causing inefficiency. For one type, the market exists whereas the price is
absent, i.e. free, for a product. An example of this type is the job
application market where the problem of over-application commonly exists,
costing recruiters much time in finding desired candidates from massive
applicants, resulting in inefficiency. To solve the problem, this paper
proposes a solution that the recruiters charge submission fees to the
applications to make the competition complete with both factors, hence
enhancing the efficiency. For the other type, the price exists whereas the
market is absent for a product. An example of this type is the real estate
agent market, where the price of the agents exists but the market, i.e. the
facility allowing the sellers' information to be efficiently discovered, is
largely absent, also causing inefficiency. In summary, the contribution of this
paper consists of two aspects: one is the discovery of the possible separation
of the two factors in free competitions; the other is, thanks to the discovery,
a solution to the over-application problem in the job market.

various `slow' effects caused by externally imposed `fast' oscillations. Such
small oscillations are often called \emph{vibrations} and the research area can
be referred as \emph{vibrodynamics}. The governing equations represent a
generic system of first-order ODEs containing a prescribed oscillating velocity
u, given in a general form. Two basic small parameters stand in for the inverse
frequency and the ratio of two time-scales; they appear in equations as regular
perturbations. The proper connections between these parameters yield the
\emph{distinguished limits}, leading to the existence of closed systems of
asymptotic equations. The aim of this paper is twofold: (i) to clarify (or to
demystify) the choices of a slow variable, and (ii) to give a coherent
exposition which is accessible for practical users in applied mathematics,
sciences and engineering. We focus our study on the usually hidden aspects of
the two-timing method such as the \emph{uniqueness or multiplicity of
distinguished limits} and \emph{universal structures of averaged equations}.
The main result is the demonstration that there are two (and only two)
different distinguished limits. The explicit instruction for practically
solving ODEs for different classes of u is presented. The key roles of drift
velocity and the qualitatively new appearance of the linearized equations are
discussed. To illustrate the broadness of our approach, two examples from
mathematical biology are shown.

highly complex optimization process involving many steps. Integrating
robustness from a passenger's point of view makes the task even more
challenging. With numerous different definitions of robustness in literature, a
real-world acceptable evaluation of the robustness of a public transport system
is to simulate its performance under a large number of possible scenarios.
Unfortunately, this is computationally very expensive. In this paper, we
therefore explore a new way of such a scenario-based robustness approximation
by using methods from machine learning. We achieve a fast approach with a very
high accuracy by gathering a subset of key features of a public transport
system and its passenger demand and training an artificial neural network to
learn the outcome of a given set of robustness tests. The network is then able
to predict the robustness of untrained instances with high accuracy using only
its key features, allowing for a robustness oracle for transport planners that
approximates the robustness in constant time. Such an oracle can be used as
black box to increase the robustness within a local search framework for
integrated public transportation planning. In computational experiments with
different benchmark instances we demonstrate an excellent quality of our
predictions.

of mass, but it does not hold information about the internal dynamics of the

micro-motions that arise from internal degrees of freedom within the target
(such as rotation and vibration), which can be remotely detected by careful
analysis of the scattered field. Here we investigate, both theoretically and
experimentally, how coupling between a pair of closely situated targets affects
the resulting micro-Doppler signatures. The presented model considers a pair of
near-field coupled resonators with dynamically reconfigurable scattering
properties. Voltage controlled varactor diodes enable modulating the scattering
cross-section of each target independently, mimicking rotational degrees of
freedom. As a result, coupled micro-Doppler combs are observed, containing new
frequency components that arise from the near field coupling, making it
possible to extract information about the internal geometry of the system from
far-field measurements. From a practical point of view, micro-Doppler
spectroscopy allows remote classification of distant objects, while deep
understanding of the coupling effects on such signatures in the low frequency
regime can provide valuable insight for radar and sonar systems, as well as
optical and stellar radio-interferometry, among many others.

techniques, allowing to extract parameters of liquids and solids in a broad
frequency range, where material's loss tangent is less than 0.5. The essence of
the method is based on exciting magnetic dipole resonance in a spherical sample
with variable dimensions. Size-dependent resonant frequencies and quality
factors of magnetic dipolar modes are mapped on real and imaginary parts of
permittivity by employing Mie theory. Samples are comprised of liquid
solutions, enclosed in stretchable covers, which allows changing the dimensions

  Comparison with the Reduced Landau--de Gennes Model",,,"10.1098/rspa.2021.0458",,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We investigate the solution landscapes of a simplified Ericksen--Leslie (sEL)
vector model for nematic liquid crystals, confined in a two-dimensional square
domain with tangent boundary conditions. An efficient numerical algorithm is
developed to construct the solution landscapes by utilizing the symmetry
properties of the model and the domain. Since the sEL model and the reduced
Landau--de Gennes (rLdG) models can be viewed as Ginzburg--Landau functionals,
we systematically compute the solution landscapes of the sEL model, for
different domain sizes, and compare with the solution landscapes of the
corresponding rLdG models. There are many similarities, including the stable
diagonal and rotated states, bifurcation behaviors, and sub-solution landscapes
with low-index saddle solutions. Significant disparities also exist between the
two models. The sEL vector model exhibits the stable solution $C\pm$ with
interior defects, high-index ""fake defects"" solutions, novel tessellating
solutions, and certain types of distinctive dynamical pathways. The solution
landscape approach provides a comprehensive and efficient way for model
comparison and is applicable to a wide range of mathematical models in physics.

  Virtualization & Isolation for IoT Software Modules",,,,,"cs.SE cs.NI cs.OS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Development, deployment and maintenance of networked software has been
revolutionized by DevOps, which have become essential to boost system software
quality and to enable agile evolution. Meanwhile the Internet of Things (IoT)
connects more and more devices which are not covered by DevOps tools:
low-power, microcontroller-based devices. In this paper, we contribute to
bridge this gap by designing Femto-Containers, a new architecture which enables
containerization, virtualization and secure deployment of software modules
embedded on microcontrollers over low-power networks. As proof-of-concept, we
implemented and evaluated Femto-Containers on popular microcontroller
architectures (Arm Cortex-M, ESP32 and RISC-V), using eBPF virtualization, and
RIOT, a common operating system in this space. We show that Femto-Containers
can virtualize and isolate multiple software modules, executed concurrently,
with very small memory footprint overhead (below 10%) and very small startup
time (tens of microseconds) compared to native code execution. We show that
Femto-Containers can satisfy the constraints of both low-level debug logic
inserted in a hot code path, and high-level business logic coded in a variety
of common programming languages. Compared to prior work, Femto-Containers thus
offer an attractive trade-off in terms of memory footprint, energy consumption,
agility and security.

  the gap between outlier detection and drift detection",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the rise of machine learning and deep learning based applications in
practice, monitoring, i.e. verifying that these operate within specification,
has become an important practical problem. An important aspect of this
monitoring is to check whether the inputs (or intermediates) have strayed from
the distribution they were validated for, which can void the performance
assurances obtained during testing.
  There are two common approaches for this. The, perhaps, more classical one is
outlier detection or novelty detection, where, for a single input we ask
whether it is an outlier, i.e. exceedingly unlikely to have originated from a
reference distribution. The second, perhaps more recent approach, is to
consider a larger number of inputs and compare its distribution to a reference
distribution (e.g. sampled during testing). This is done under the label drift
detection.
  In this work, we bridge the gap between outlier detection and drift detection
through comparing a given number of inputs to an automatically chosen part of
the reference distribution.

probability distributions and efficient density estimation. However, they are
well known to fail while detecting Out-of-Distribution (OOD) inputs as they
directly encode the local features of the input representations in their latent
space. In this paper, we solve this overconfidence issue of normalizing flows
by demonstrating that flows, if extended by an attention mechanism, can
reliably detect outliers including adversarial attacks. Our approach does not
require outlier data for training and we showcase the efficiency of our method
for OOD detection by reporting state-of-the-art performance in diverse
experimental settings. Code available at

solution to give an understanding of the behavioral biases that often occur in
the capital market. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the
broader bibliometric literature on the term and concept of herding behavior.
Articles are collected through the help of software consisting of Publish or
Perish (PoP), Google Scholar, Mendeley, and VOSViewer through a systematic
approach, explicit and reproductive methods. In addition, the articles were
scanned by Scimagojr.com (Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4), analyzing 83 articles of 261
related articles from reputable and non-reputable journals from 1996 to 2021.
Mendeley software is used to manage and resume references. To review this
database, classification was performed using the VOSviewer software. Four
clusters were reviewed; The words that appear most often in each group are the
type of stock market, the type of crisis, and the factors that cause herding.
Thus these four clusters became the main research themes on the topic of
herding in times of crisis. Meanwhile, methodology and strategy are the themes
for future research in the future.

  Hersonissos, Greece",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Extracting information from documents usually relies on natural language
processing methods working on one-dimensional sequences of text. In some cases,
for example, for the extraction of key information from semi-structured
documents, such as invoice-documents, spatial and formatting information of
text are crucial to understand the contextual meaning. Convolutional neural
networks are already common in computer vision models to process and extract
relationships in multidimensional data. Therefore, natural language processing
models have already been combined with computer vision models in the past, to
benefit from e.g. positional information and to improve performance of these
key information extraction models. Existing models were either trained on
unpublished data sets or on an annotated collection of receipts, which did not
focus on PDF-like documents. Hence, in this research project a template-based
document generator was created to compare state-of-the-art models for
information extraction. An existing information extraction model ""Chargrid""
(Katti et al., 2019) was reconstructed and the impact of a bounding box
regression decoder, as well as the impact of an NLP pre-processing step was
evaluated for information extraction from documents. The results have shown
that NLP based pre-processing is beneficial for model performance. However, the
use of a bounding box regression decoder increases the model performance only
for fields that do not follow a rectangular shape.

asymmetric with respect to space and time coordinates. In present paper we
generalise the concept of continuous causal path, which is the basis of path
integration, to the sequences of causally ordered spacetime regions, and
present evaluation rules for Feynman path integrals over such sequences in
terms of wavelet transform. Both the path integrals and the wavelet transform
in our model are symmetric with respect to the light-front variables
($x^+,x^-$). The definition of a spacetime event in our generalization is very
much like the definition of event in probability theory.

  displacement",,,,,"physics.soc-ph q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this study, we classify the COVID-19 anomalous diffusion in two categories
of countries based on the mean squared displacement (MSD) of daily new cases,
which includes the top four countries and four randomly selected countries in
terms of the total cases. The COVID-19 diffusion is a stochastic process, and
the daily new cases are regarded as the displacements of diffusive particles.
The diffusion environment of COVID-19 in each country is heterogeneous, in
which the underlying dynamic process is anomalous diffusion. The calculated MSD
is a power law function of time, and the power law exponent is not a constant
but varies with time. The power law exponents are estimated by using the
bi-exponential model and the long short-term memory network (LSTM). The
bi-exponential model frequently use in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can
quantify the power law exponent and make an easy prediction. The LSTM network
has much better accuracy than the bi-exponential model in predicting the power
law exponent. The LSTM network is more flexible and preferred to predict the
power law exponent, which is independent on the unique mathematical formula.
The diffusion process of COVID-19 can be classified based on the power law
exponent. More specific evaluation and suggestion can be proposed and submitted
to the government in order to control the COVID-19 diffusion.
