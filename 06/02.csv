any unseen domain shift when deployed in a new target environment; and
data-efficient, for reducing development costs by using as little labels as
possible. To this end, we study semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG),
which aims to learn a domain-generalizable model using multi-source,
partially-labeled training data. We design two benchmarks that cover
state-of-the-art methods developed in two related fields, i.e., domain
generalization (DG) and semi-supervised learning (SSL). We find that the DG
methods, which by design are unable to handle unlabeled data, perform poorly
with limited labels in SSDG; the SSL methods, especially FixMatch, obtain much
better results but are still far away from the basic vanilla model trained
using full labels. We propose StyleMatch, a simple approach that extends
FixMatch with a couple of new ingredients tailored for SSDG: 1) stochastic
modeling for reducing overfitting in scarce labels, and 2) multi-view
consistency learning for enhancing domain generalization. Despite the concise
designs, StyleMatch achieves significant improvements in SSDG. We hope our
approach and the comprehensive benchmarks can pave the way for future research
on generalizable and data-efficient learning systems. The source code is

  description of the $d_n=d<1$ case",,,,"math.PR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We prove that the reverse characteristic polynomial $\det(I_n - zA_n)$ of a
random $n \times n$ matrix $A_n$ with iid $\mathrm{Bernoulli}(d/n)$ entries
converges in distribution towards the random infinite product $\prod_{\ell =
1}^\infty(1-z^\ell)^{Y_\ell}$ where $Y_\ell$ are independent
$\mathrm{Poisson}(d^\ell/\ell)$ random variables. We show that this random
function is a Poisson analog of more classical Gaussian objects such as the
Gaussian holomorphic chaos. As a byproduct, we obtain new simple proofs of
previous results on the asymptotic behaviour of extremal eigenvalues of sparse
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi digraphs: for every $d>1$, the greatest eigenvalue of $A_n$
is close to $d$ and the second greatest is smaller than $\sqrt{d}$, a
Ramanujan-like property for irregular digraphs. For $d<1$, the only non-zero
eigenvalues of $A_n$ converge to a Poisson multipoint process on the unit
circle.
  Our results also extend to the semi-sparse regime where $d$ is allowed to
grow to $\infty$ with $n$, slower than $n^{o(1)}$. We show that the reverse
characteristic polynomial converges towards a more classical object written in
terms of the exponential of a log-correlated real Gaussian field, as in the
dense case studied in a recent paper \cite{bordenave2020convergence}. In the
semi-sparse regime, the empirical spectral distribution of $A_n/\sqrt{d_n}$
converges to the circle distribution; as a consequence of our results, the
second eigenvalue sticks to the edge of the circle.

ALFRED, a well-designed dataset for the task, but achieved only very low
accuracy. This paper proposes a new method, which outperforms the previous
methods by a large margin. It is based on a combination of several new ideas.
One is a two-stage interpretation of the provided instructions. The method
first selects and interprets an instruction without using visual information,
yielding a tentative action sequence prediction. It then integrates the
prediction with the visual information etc., yielding the final prediction of
an action and an object. As the object's class to interact is identified in the
first stage, it can accurately select the correct object from the input image.
Moreover, our method considers multiple egocentric views of the environment and
extracts essential information by applying hierarchical attention conditioned
on the current instruction. This contributes to the accurate prediction of
actions for navigation. A preliminary version of the method won the ALFRED
Challenge 2020. The current version achieves the unseen environment's success
rate of 4.45% with a single view, which is further improved to 8.37% with

trained on human judgment data to estimate the perceptual complexity of
grouping patterns. The numbers of initial mixture components and final combined
groups determine the rank of the scatterplot. ClustRank improves on existing
VQM techniques by mimicking human judgments on two-Gaussian cluster patterns
and gives more accuracy when ranking general cluster patterns in scatterplots.
We demonstrate its benefit by analyzing kinship data for genome-wide

applications. This motivates the need to make outputs of clustering algorithms
fair. Traditionally, new fair algorithmic variants to clustering algorithms are
developed for specific notions of fairness. However, depending on the
application context, different definitions of fairness might need to be
employed. As a result, new algorithms and analysis need to be proposed for each
combination of clustering algorithm and fairness definition. Additionally, each
new algorithm would need to be reimplemented for deployment in a real-world
system. Hence, we propose an alternate approach to group-level fairness in
center-based clustering inspired by research on data poisoning attacks. We seek
to augment the original dataset with a small number of data points, called
antidote data. When clustering is undertaken on this new dataset, the output is
fair, for the chosen clustering algorithm and fairness definition. We formulate
this as a general bi-level optimization problem which can accommodate any
center-based clustering algorithms and fairness notions. We then categorize
approaches for solving this bi-level optimization for two different problem
settings. Extensive experiments on different clustering algorithms and fairness
notions show that our algorithms can achieve desired levels of fairness on many
real-world datasets with a very small percentage of antidote data added. We
also find that our algorithms achieve lower fairness costs and competitive
clustering performance compared to other state-of-the-art fair clustering
algorithms.

generation of the large nonlinear dynamical range of the basilar membrane (BM)
and pressure response, in the decoupling between cochlear gain and tuning, and
in the dynamic stabilization of the high-gain BM response in the peak region.
The large and closely correlated dependence on stimulus level of the BM
velocity and fluid pressure gain (Dong and Olson, 2013), is consistent with a
physiologically-oriented schematization of the outer hair cell (OHC) mechanism
if two hydrodynamic effects are accounted for: amplification of the
differential pressure associated with a focusing phenomenon, and viscous
damping at the BM-fluid interface. The predictions of the analytical 2-D WKB
approach are compared to solutions of a 3-D finite element model, showing that
these hydrodynamic phenomena yield stable high-gain response in the peak region
and a smooth transition among models with different effectiveness of the active
mechanism, mimicking the cochlear nonlinear response over a wide stimulus level
range. This study explains how an effectively anti-damping nonlinear OHC force
may yield large BM and pressure dynamical ranges along with an almost

other effects, one of the consequences of harbouring such fields is the
deformation of the neutron star structure, leading, together with rotation, to
the emission of continuous gravitational waves. On the one hand, the details of
their internal magnetic fields are mostly unknown. Likewise, their internal
structure, encoded by the equation of state, is highly uncertain. Here we
present a study of axisymmetric models of isolated magnetised neutron stars,
for various realistic equations of state considered viable by observations and
nuclear physics constraints. We show that it is possible to find simple
relations between the magnetic deformation of a neutron star, its Komar mass
and its circumferential radius. Such relations are quasi-universal, meaning
that they are mostly independent on the equation of state of the neutron star
and only slightly dependent on the magnetic field configuration. Being
formulated in terms of potentially observable quantities, as we discuss, our
results could help to constrain the magnetic properties of the neutron star
interior and to better assess the detectability of continuous gravitational
waves by isolated neutron stars, without knowing their equation of state. Our
results are derived both in general relativity and in scalar-tensor theories -
one of the most promising extensions of general relativity - in this case by
considering also the scalar charge. We show that even in this case general
relations hold that account for deviations from general relativity, that could
potentially be used to set constraints on the gravitational theory.

price at which they originally bought it. While this is generally not
consistent with rational utility maximization, it does reflect two strong
empirical regularities that are central to the behavioral science of human
decision-making: a tendency to evaluate outcomes relative to a reference point
determined by context (in this case the original purchase price), and the
phenomenon of loss aversion in which people are particularly prone to avoid
outcomes below the reference point. Here we explore the implications of
reference points and loss aversion in optimal stopping problems, where people
evaluate a sequence of options in one pass, either accepting the option and
stopping the search or giving up on the option forever. The best option seen so
far sets a reference point that shifts as the search progresses, and a biased
decision-maker's utility incurs an additional penalty when they accept a later
option that is below this reference point.
  We formulate and study a behaviorally well-motivated version of the optimal
stopping problem that incorporates these notions of reference dependence and
loss aversion. We obtain tight bounds on the performance of a biased agent in
this model relative to the best option obtainable in retrospect (a type of
prophet inequality for biased agents), as well as tight bounds on the ratio
between the performance of a biased agent and the performance of a rational
one. We further establish basic monotonicity results, and show an exponential
gap between the performance of a biased agent in a stopping problem with
respect to a worst-case versus a random order. As part of this, we establish
fundamental differences between optimal stopping problems for rational versus
biased agents, and these differences inform our analysis.

labeling. Since the SSL performance is greatly influenced by the quality of

learning that improves the prior approach in two aspects. First, the vanilla
mutual learners suffer from the coupling issue that models may converge to
learn homogeneous knowledge. We resolve this issue by introducing mean teachers
to generate mutual supervisions so that there is no direct interaction between
the two students. We also show that strong data augmentations, model noises and
heterogeneous network architectures are essential to alleviate the model
coupling. Second, we notice that mutual learning fails to leverage the
network's own ability for pseudo label refinement. Therefore, we introduce
self-rectification that leverages the internal knowledge and explicitly
rectifies the pseudo labels before the mutual teaching. Such self-rectification
and mutual teaching collaboratively improve the pseudo label accuracy
throughout the learning. The proposed robust mutual learning demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation in low-data regime.

are given a set of axis-parallel rectangles in the plane and the goal is to
select a subset of non-overlapping rectangles of maximum cardinality. In a
recent breakthrough, Mitchell [2021] obtained the first constant-factor
approximation algorithm for MISR. His algorithm achieves an approximation ratio
of 10 and it is based on a dynamic program that intuitively recursively
partitions the input plane into special polygons called corner-clipped
rectangles (CCRs), without intersecting certain special horizontal line
segments called fences.
  In this paper, we present a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for MISR
which is also based on a recursive partitioning scheme. First, we use a
partition into a class of axis-parallel polygons with constant complexity each
that are more general than CCRs. This allows us to provide an arguably simpler
analysis and at the same time already improves the approximation ratio to 6.
Then, using a more elaborate charging scheme and a recursive partitioning into
general axis-parallel polygons with constant complexity, we improve our
approximation ratio to $2+\epsilon$. In particular, we construct a recursive
partitioning based on more general fences which can be sequences of up to
$O(1/\epsilon)$ line segments each. This partitioning routine and our other new
ideas may be useful for future work towards a PTAS for MISR.

results disclose a sign change in the spin Hall angle (SHA) when the Fermi
energy relative to the Dirac point matches the Bychkov-Rashba energy scale,
irrespective of the magnitude of the spin-valley interaction imprinted on the
graphene layer. The behavior of the SHA is connected to a reversal of the total
internal angular momentum of Bloch electrons that reflects the spin-pseudospin
entanglement induced by SOC. We also show that the charge-spin conversion
reaches a maximum when the Fermi level lies at the edge of the spin-minority
band in agreement with previous findings. Both features are fingerprints of
spin-helical Dirac fermions and suggest a direct way to estimate the strength
of proximity-induced SOC from transport data. The relevance of these findings

period, are important for catastrophe modelling. This paper addresses the issue
of generating event sets of extreme river flow for northern England and
southern Scotland, a region which has been particularly affected by severe
flooding over the past 20 years. We start by analysing historical extreme river
flow across 45 gauges, located within the study region, using methods from
extreme value analysis, including the concept of extremal principal components.
Our analysis reveals interesting connections between the extremal dependence
structure and the region's topography/climate. We then introduce a framework
which is based on modelling the distribution of the extremal principal
components in order to generate synthetic events of extreme river flow. The
generative framework is dimension-reducing in that it distinctly handles the
principal components based on their contribution to describing the nature of
extreme river flow across the study region. We also detail a data-driven
approach to select the optimal dimension. Synthetic flood events are
subsequently generated efficiently by sampling from the fitted distribution.
Our approach for generating hazard event sets can be easily implemented by
practitioners and our results indicate good agreement between the observed and
simulated extreme river flow dynamics. For the considered application, we also
find that our approach outperforms existing statistical approaches for
generating hazard event sets.

maximal torus and its Weyl group. These notions are analogous to the notions of
maximal tori and Weyl groups in the theory of compact Lie groups, where they
are fundamental. For profinite groups, maximal tori and Weyl groups contain the

benefit from methods to reduce the number of spectral bands while retaining the
most useful information for a specific application. We propose a novel band
selection method to select a reduced set of wavelengths, obtained from an HSI
system in the context of image classification. Our approach consists of two
main steps: the first utilizes a filter-based approach to find relevant
spectral bands based on a collinearity analysis between a band and its
neighbors. This analysis helps to remove redundant bands and dramatically
reduces the search space. The second step applies a wrapper-based approach to
select bands from the reduced set based on their information entropy values,
and trains a compact Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to evaluate the
performance of the current selection. We present classification results
obtained from our method and compare them to other feature selection methods on
two hyperspectral image datasets. Additionally, we use the original
hyperspectral data cube to simulate the process of using actual filters in a
multispectral imager. We show that our method produces more suitable results

timescale of a standard thin accretion disk. It implies that the variabilities
of CL AGNs cannot be reproduced by varying the mass accretion rate of the thin
disk. In this work, we employ a magnetic accretion disk-outflow model to
calculate the inflow time of the disk predominantly driven by magnetic
outflows. In this model, most angular momentum of the gas in the disk is
carried away by the outflows, and therefore its radial velocity can be
substantially higher than that of a conventional viscous disk. Our calculations
show that the inflow time of such a disk with outflows can be around several
years to tens years. The calculated spectra of the disk with outflows can fit
the observed spectra of a CL AGN Mrk 1018 quite well both in the low and high
states. The derived inflow time of such a disk with outflows is around 5 years
in the high state, while it becomes $\sim 20$ years in the low state, which is
roughly consistent with the observations of the variabilities in Mrk 1018.

outcomes to treatment choices or surgical interventions. 3D CT images are
routinely acquired in the oncological worklows and deliver accurate rendering
of internal anatomy and therefore can be used opportunistically to assess the
amount of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue compartments. Powerful tools of
artificial intelligence such as deep learning are making it feasible now to
segment the entire 3D image and generate accurate measurements of all internal
anatomy. These will enable the overcoming of the severe bottleneck that existed
previously, namely, the need for manual segmentation, which was prohibitive to
scale to the hundreds of 2D axial slices that made up a 3D volumetric image.
Automated tools such as presented here will now enable harvesting whole-body
measurements from 3D CT or MRI images, leading to a new era of discovery of the
drivers of various diseases based on individual tissue, organ volume, shape,
and functional status. These measurements were hitherto unavailable thereby
limiting the field to a very small and limited subset. These discoveries and
the potential to perform individual image segmentation with high speed and
accuracy are likely to lead to the incorporation of these 3D measures into
individual specific treatment planning models related to nutrition, aging,
chemotoxicity, surgery and survival after the onset of a major disease such as
cancer.

and show that they cannot be formulated using stationary reward functions.
Convex MDPs generalize the standard reinforcement learning (RL) problem
formulation to a larger framework that includes many supervised and
unsupervised RL problems, such as apprenticeship learning, constrained MDPs,
and so-called `pure exploration'. Our approach is to reformulate the convex MDP
problem as a min-max game involving policy and cost (negative reward)
`players', using Fenchel duality. We propose a meta-algorithm for solving this
problem and show that it unifies many existing algorithms in the literature.

this study's goal was to develop a classification algorithm that was both
suitably accurate and finely grained to be applied on a large scale for
assessing the qualitative sentiment expressed in clinical trial abstracts.
Additionally, this study seeks to compare the performance of the proposed

classification algorithm for clinical trial abstracts using a semi-supervised
natural language process model based on the Bidirectional Encoder

abstracts annotated by a group of experts in academic medicine. Results: The
use of this algorithm was found to have a classification accuracy of 91.3%,
with a macro F1-Score of 0.92, which is a significant improvement in accuracy
when compared to previous methods and expert ratings, while also making the
sentiment classification finer grained than previous studies. The proposed

accommodate this change. But crucially, previously learned behaviors and models
should still be suitable to accelerate this relearning. In this paper, we aim
to study how generative models of possible outcomes can allow a robot to learn
visual representations of affordances, so that the robot can sample potentially
possible outcomes in new situations, and then further train its policy to
achieve those outcomes. In effect, prior data is used to learn what kinds of
outcomes may be possible, such that when the robot encounters an unfamiliar
setting, it can sample potential outcomes from its model, attempt to reach
them, and thereby update both its skills and its outcome model. This approach,
visuomotor affordance learning (VAL), can be used to train goal-conditioned
policies that operate on raw image inputs, and can rapidly learn to manipulate
new objects via our proposed affordance-directed exploration scheme. We show
that VAL can utilize prior data to solve real-world tasks such drawer opening,

discuss and understand what choices, among the high-level algorithmic options

implement more than 50 of these choices in a generic adversarial imitation

many of our findings confirm common practices, some of them are surprising or

Johnstone has advocated for the development of a constructive theory of uniform

emission from the halo are correlated, implying a tight relation between the
thermal and non-thermal components. The diffuse radio structure in the south
east with a projected size of 3.5 Mpc is the most extended radio relic detected

centre, suggesting the electron ageing in the post-shock regions. The shock
Mach numbers for the relics derived from the spectral index map range between
2.0 and 3.2. However, the integrated spectral indices lead to increasingly high
Mach numbers for the relics farther from the cluster centre. This discrepancy
could be because the relation between injection and integrated spectra does not
hold for distant shocks, suggesting that the cooling time for the
radio-emitting electrons is longer than the crossing time of the shocks. The
variations in the surface brightness of the relics and the low Mach numbers
imply that the radio-emitting electrons are re-accelerated from fossil plasma
that could originate in active galactic nuclei.

problem, we develop an approach based on multispectral deep-ultraviolet (UV)
microscopy that provides novel quantitative insight into the aggressiveness and
grade of this disease. First, we find that UV spectral signatures from
endogenous molecules give rise to a phenotypical continuum that differentiates
critical structures of thin tissue sections with subcellular spatial
resolution, including nuclei, cytoplasm, stroma, basal cells, nerves, and
inflammation. Further, we show that this phenotypical continuum can be applied
as a surrogate biomarker of prostate cancer malignancy, where patients with the
most aggressive tumors show a ubiquitous glandular phenotypical shift. Lastly,
we adapt a two-part Cycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Network to
translate the label-free deep-UV images into virtual hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) stained images. Agreement between the virtual H&E images and the gold
standard H&E-stained tissue sections is evaluated by a panel of pathologists
who find that the two modalities are in excellent agreement. This work has
significant implications towards improving our ability to objectively quantify
prostate cancer grade and aggressiveness, thus improving the management and
clinical outcomes of prostate cancer patients. This same approach can also be
applied broadly in other tumor types to achieve low-cost, stain-free,
quantitative histopathological analysis.

typically display two main features: a central brightness depression and a
narrow, bright ""photon ring"" consisting of strongly lensed images superposed on
top of the direct emission. The photon ring closely tracks a theoretical curve
on the image plane corresponding to light rays that asymptote to unstably bound
photon orbits around the black hole. This critical curve has a size and shape
that are purely governed by the Kerr geometry; in contrast, the size, shape,
and depth of the observed brightness depression all depend on the details of
the emission region. For instance, images of spherical accretion models display
a distinctive dark region -- the ""black hole shadow"" -- that completely fills
the photon ring. By contrast, in models of equatorial disks extending to the
black hole's event horizon, the darkest region in the image is restricted to a
much smaller area -- an inner shadow -- whose edge lies near the direct lensed
image of the equatorial horizon. Using both semi-analytic models and general
relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations, we demonstrate that the
photon ring and inner shadow may be simultaneously visible in submillimeter
images of M87*, where magnetically arrested disk (MAD) simulations predict that
the emission arises in a thin region near the equatorial plane. We show that
the relative size, shape, and centroid of the photon ring and inner shadow can
be used to estimate the black hole mass and spin, breaking degeneracies in
measurements of these quantities that rely on the photon ring alone. Both
features may be accessible to direct observation via high-dynamic-range images
with a next-generation Event Horizon Telescope.

Fractal structure also emerges in hydro-dynamical simulations of star-forming
clouds. Simulating the formation of realistic star clusters with
hydro-dynamical simulations is a computational challenge, considering that only
the statistically averaged results of large batches of simulations are
reliable, due to the chaotic nature of the gravitational N-body problem. While
large sets of initial conditions for N-body runs can be produced by
hydro-dynamical simulations of star formation, this is prohibitively expensive
in terms of computational time. Here we address this issue by introducing a new
technique for generating many sets of new initial conditions from a given set
of star masses, positions and velocities from a hydro-dynamical simulation. We
use hierarchical clustering in phase space to learn a tree representation of
the spatial and kinematic relations between stars. This constitutes the basis
for the random generation of new sets of stars which share the same clustering
structure of the original ones but have individually different masses,
positions, and velocities. We apply this method to the output of a number of
hydro-dynamical star-formation simulations, comparing the generated initial
conditions to the original ones through a series of quantitative tests,
including comparing mass and velocity distributions and fractal dimension.
Finally, we evolve both the original and the generated star clusters using a
direct N-body code, obtaining a qualitatively similar evolution.

use simulated transmission spectroscopy to evaluate the detectability of
spectral features with HST and JWST assuming diverse atmospheric scenarios
(e.g., atmospheres dominated by H2, H2O, CO2, or O2). We find that H2O and CH4
present in a low mean-molecular weight atmosphere could be detected with HST in
1 transit for the two outermost planets, while H2O in a clear steam atmosphere
could be detected in 6 transits or fewer with HST for all three planets. We
predict that observations using JWST/NIRISS would be capable of detecting a
clear steam atmosphere in 1 transit for each planet, and H2O absorption in a
hazy steam atmosphere in 2 transits or less. In a clear, desiccated atmosphere,
O2 absorption may be detectable for all three planets with NIRISS. If the L
98-59 planets possess a clear, Venus-like atmosphere, NIRSpec could detect CO2
within 26 transits for each planet, but the presence of H2SO4 clouds would
significantly suppress CO2 absorption. The L 98-59 system is an excellent
laboratory for comparative planetary studies of transiting multiplanet systems,
and observations of the system via HST and JWST would present a unique
opportunity to test the accuracy of the models presented in this study.

0.5$). Here we present results from a reverberation-mapping project of some of
the most luminous and highest redshift quasars that have been mapped to date.
The study is based on almost twenty years of photometric monitoring of 11
quasars, six of which were monitored spectrophotometrically for 13 years. This
is the longest reverberation-mapping project carried out so far on this type of
AGNs. We successfully measure a time lag between the CIV$\lambda$1549 broad
emission line and the quasar continuum in three objects, and measure a
CIII$\lambda$1909 lag in one quasar. Together with recently published data on
CIV reverberation mapping, the BLR size is found to scale as the square root of
the UV luminosity over eight orders of magnitude in AGN luminosity. There is a
significant scatter in the relation, part of which may be intrinsic to the
AGNs. Although the CIV line is probably less well suited than Balmer lines for
determination of the mass of the black hole, virial masses are tentatively
computed and in spite of a large scatter we find that the mass of the black
hole scales as the square root of the UV luminosity.

We present a method to derive accurate timescales of the different evolutionary
phases of the high-mass star formation process. We model a representative
number of massive clumps of the ATLASGAL-TOP100 sample which cover all the
evolutionary stages. The models describe an isothermal collapse and the
subsequent warm-up phase, for which we follow their chemical evolution. The
timescale of each phase is derived by comparing the results of the models with
the properties of the sources of the ATLASGAL-TOP100 sample, taking into
account the mass and luminosity of the clumps, and the column densities of
methyl acetylene (CH$_3$CCH), acetonitrile (CH$_3$CN), formaldehyde (H$_2$CO)
and methanol (CH$_3$OH). We find that the chosen molecular tracers are affected
by the thermal evolution of the clumps, showing steep ice evaporation gradients
from 10$^3$ to 10$^5$ AU during the warm-up phase. We succeed in reproducing
the observed column densities of CH$_3$CCH and CH$_3$CN, while H$_2$CO and
CH$_3$OH show a poorer agreement with the observed values. The total (massive)
star formation time is found to be $\sim5.2\times10^5$ yr, which is defined by
the timescales of the individual evolutionary phases of the ATLASGAL-TOP100
sample: $\sim5\times10^4$ yr for 70-$\mu$m weak, $\sim1.2\times10^5$ yr for
mid-IR weak, $\sim2.4\times10^5$ yr for mid-IR bright and $\sim1.1\times10^5$

molecular tracers that can act as chemical clocks, allow to get robust
estimates of the duration of the individual phases of the high-mass star
formation process, with the advantage of being capable to include additional

detections are progressively drawing a spectacular fresco of BBH masses, spins
and merger rates. In this review, we discuss the main formation channels of
BBHs from stellar evolution and dynamics. Uncertainties on massive star
evolution (e.g., stellar winds, rotation, overshooting and nuclear reaction
rates), core-collapse supernovae and pair instability still hamper our
comprehension of the mass spectrum and spin distribution of black holes (BHs),
but substantial progress has been done in the field over the last few years. On
top of this, the efficiency of mass transfer in a binary system and the physics
of common envelope substantially affect the final BBH demography. Dynamical
processes in dense stellar systems can trigger the formation of BHs in the mass
gap and intermediate-mass BHs via hierarchical BH mergers and via multiple
stellar collisions. Finally, we discuss the importance of reconstructing the
cosmic evolution of BBHs.

stars, primarily encountered close to the center of young supernova remnants
(SNRs) and characterized by thermal X-ray emission. Aims. Our goal is to
perform a systematic study of the proper motion of all known CCOs with
appropriate data available. In addition, we aim to measure the expansion of
three SNRs within our sample to obtain a direct handle on their kinematics and
age. Methods. We analyze multiple archival Chandra data sets, consisting of HRC
and ACIS observations separated by temporal baselines between 8 and 15 years.
In order to correct for systematic astrometric uncertainties, we establish a
reference frame using X-ray detected sources in Gaia DR2, to provide accurate
proper motion estimates for our target CCOs. Complementarily, we use our
coaligned data sets to trace the expansion of three SNRs by directly measuring
the spatial offset of various filaments and ejecta clumps between different
epochs. Results. In total, we present new proper motion measurements for six
CCOs, among which we do not find any indication of a hypervelocity object. We
tentatively identify direct signatures of expansion for the SNRs G15.9+0.2 and
Kes 79, at estimated significance of $2.5\sigma$ and $2\sigma$, respectively.
Moreover, we confirm recent results by Borkowski et al., measuring the rapid
expansion of G350.1$-$0.3 at almost $6000\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$, which places its
maximal age at $600-700$ years. The observed expansion, combined with the
rather small proper motion of its CCO, implies the need for a very
inhomogeneous circumstellar medium to explain the highly asymmetric appearance
of the SNR. Finally, for the SNR RX J1713.7$-$3946, we combine previously
published expansion measurements with our measurement of the CCO's proper
motion to obtain a constraining upper limit of $1700$ years on the system's
age.

digraph (directed graph) as a tool for characterizing digraphs and studying
their algebraic connectivity. In particular, digraphs with a restricted
numerical range of a single point, a horizontal line segment, and a vertical
line segment were characterized as $k$-imploding stars, directed joins of
bidirectional digraphs, and regular tournaments, respectively. In this article,
we extend these results by investigating digraphs whose restricted numerical
range is a convex polygon in the complex plane. We provide computational
methods for identifying these polygonal digraphs and show that these digraphs
can be broken into three disjoint classes: normal, restricted-normal, and
pseudo-normal digraphs, all of which are closed under the digraph complement.
We prove sufficient conditions for normal digraphs and show that the directed
join of two normal digraphs results in a restricted-normal digraph. Also, we
prove that directed joins are the only restricted-normal digraphs when the
order is square-free or twice a square-free number. Finally, we provide methods
to construct restricted-normal digraphs that are not directed joins for all
orders that are neither square-free nor twice a square-free number.

with perfect matchings. The notion of matching minors has been used to give a
structural description of bipartite graphs on which the number of perfect
matchings can becomputed efficiently, based on a result of Little, by McCuaig
et al. in 1999.In this paper we generalise basic ideas from the graph minor
series by Robertson and Seymour to the setting of bipartite graphs with perfect
matchings. We introducea version of Erdos-Posa property for matching minors and
find a direct link between this property and planarity. From this, it follows
that a class of bipartite graphs withperfect matchings has bounded perfect
matching width if and only if it excludes aplanar matching minor. We also
present algorithms for bipartite graphs of bounded perfect matching width for a
matching version of the disjoint paths problem, matching minor containment, and
for counting the number of perfect matchings. From our structural results, we
obtain that recognising whether a bipartite graphGcontains afixed planar

a bipartite graph that excludes a fixed planar graph as a matching minor are
both polynomial time solvable.

environmental levels. Yet, these same perturbations can elicit variation in
behavior. The interplay between functional robustness and behavioral
variability is exemplified at the organellar level by the beating of cilia and
flagella. The complex bending patterns of cilia emerge from the coordinated
activities of hundreds of different proteins. Cilia are motile despite wide
genetic diversity between and within species, large differences in
intracellular concentrations of ATP and calcium, and considerable environment
fluctuations in temperature and viscosity. At the same time, these
perturbations result in a variety of spatio-temporal patterns that span a rich,
and as of yet uncharted, behavioral space. To investigate this behavioral space
we analyzed the dynamics of isolated cilia from the unicellular algae
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in thirty four different environmental and genetic
conditions. We found that, despite large changes in beat frequency and
amplitude, the space of waveform shapes is low-dimensional. Two features,
parabolicity and asymmetry of the tangent angle, account for eighty per cent of
the observed variation. Remarkably, the geometry of this behavioral space
accords with the predictions of a simple mechanochemical model in the low
viscosity regime. This allowed us to associate waveform shape variability with
changes in only the curvature response coefficients of the dynein motors. Our
work demonstrates that, despite the molecular complexity of the cilium, the
space of beat variations is low dimensional and can be attributed to variation
in mechanochemical regulation of the dynein motors.

semidiscrete energy stability for the scalar anisotropic wave equation. The
theoretical stability results are confirmed with numerical experiments that
also demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed scheme. The

radiation and the interstellar medium (ISM) in young supernova remnants (SNRs)

86. Both SNRs emit strong nonthermal X-rays and TeV $\gamma$-rays, and they
contain clumpy distributions of interstellar gas that includes both atomic and
molecular hydrogen. We find that shock-cloud interactions provide a viable
explanation for the spatial correlation between the X-rays and ISM. In these
interactions, the supernova shocks hit the typically pc-scale dense cores,
generating a highly turbulent velocity field that amplifies the magnetic field
up to 0.1-1 mG. This amplification leads to enhanced nonthermal synchrotron
emission around the clumps, whereas the cosmic-ray electrons do not penetrate
the clumps. Accordingly, the nonthermal X-rays exhibit a spatial distribution
similar to that of the ISM on the pc scale, while they are anticorrelated at
sub-pc scales. These results predict that hadronic $\gamma$-rays can be emitted
from the dense cores, resulting in a spatial correspondence between the
$\gamma$-rays and the ISM. The current pc-scale resolution of $\gamma$-ray
observations is too low to resolve this correspondence. Future $\gamma$-ray
observations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array will be able to resolve the
sub-pc-scale $\gamma$-ray distribution and provide clues to the origin of these
cosmic $\gamma$-rays.

authorities or individuals, to hire a team of workers from the crowd of
connected people, to execute complex tasks. In this paper, we investigate two
different CMCS recruitment strategies allowing task requesters to form teams of
socially connected and skilled workers: i) a platform-based strategy where the
platform exploits its own knowledge about the workers to form a team and ii) a
leader-based strategy where the platform designates a group leader that
recruits its own suitable team given its own knowledge about its Social Network
(SN) neighbors. We first formulate the recruitment as an Integer Linear Program
(ILP) that optimally forms teams according to four fuzzy-logic-based criteria:
level of expertise, social relationship strength, recruitment cost, and
recruiter's confidence level. To cope with NP-hardness, we design a novel
low-complexity CMCS recruitment approach relying on Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), specifically graph embedding and clustering techniques, to shrink the
workers' search space and afterwards, exploiting a meta-heuristic genetic
algorithm to select appropriate workers. Simulation results applied on a
real-world dataset illustrate the performance of both proposed CMCS recruitment
approaches. It is shown that our proposed low-complexity GNN-based recruitment
algorithm achieves close performances to those of the baseline ILP with
significant computational time saving and ability to operate on large-scale
mobile crowdsourcing platforms. It is also shown that compared to the
leader-based strategy, the platform-based strategy recruits a more skilled team
but with lower SN relationships and higher cost.

distributions and marginalize latent variables, which enables the
decomposability of a tractable variational lower bound and leads to stochastic
optimization. Our inference approach is able to model data in which outputs do
not share a common input set with a computational complexity independent of the

by lateral epitaxy and coalescence into a continuous film. Remote interactions

of the pinholes permits exfoliation of continuous, free-standing GaSb

variable (CV) is often limited by user-intuition and prior knowledge about the
system, which lacks a rigorous assessment of their optimality over other
candidate CVs. To address this issue, we propose a generic approach in which we
first choose the possible combinations of inter-residue Calpha-distances within
a given macromolecule as a set of input CVs. Subsequently we derive a
non-linear combination of latent-space embedded collective variables via
auto-encoding the unbiased MD simulation trajectories within the framework of
feed-forward neural network. We demonstrate the ability of the derived latent
space variables in elucidating the conformational landscape in three
hierarchically complex systems. When the conformational dynamics is resolved
along the latent space CVs, it identifies key metastable states of a
bead-in-a-spring polymer. The combination of the adopted dimensionally

revealing multiple spatially well-resolved and kinetically well-separated
metastable conformations. A quantitative comparison based on variational
approach to Markov Process of the auto encoder-derived latent-space CVs with

to predict for a user a small subset of items from a catalog of several million

of electron density in the CuO$_2$ planes, is ubiquitous across different
families and presents a clear interplay with superconductivity. Until recently,
CDW had been found to be confined inside a rather small region of the phase

occurrence might shed doubts on the possibility that such ""low temperature

coexisting with CDW at lower temperatures and persisting up to temperatures
well above the pseudogap opening. Here we review the characteristics of these
high temperature charge modulations, which are present in several cuprate

verification of a concurrent program to a series of verification tasks of
sequential programs. Our approach is modular in the sense that each sequential
verification task roughly corresponds to the verification of a single thread,
with some additional information about the environment in which it operates.
Information regarding the environment is gathered during the run of the
algorithm, by need.
  While our approach is general, it specializes on concurrent programs where
the threads are structured hierarchically. The idea is to exploit the hierarchy
in order to minimize the amount of information that needs to be transferred
between threads. To that end, we verify one of the threads, considered ""main"",
as a sequential program. Its verification process initiates queries to its
""environment"" (which may contain multiple threads). Those queries are answered
by sequential verification, if the environment consists of a single thread, or,
otherwise, by applying the same hierarchical algorithm on the environment.
  Our technique is fully automatic, and allows us to use any off-the-shelf
sequential model checker. We implemented our technique in a tool called CoMuS

introduced by Jordan, Kinderlehrer and Otto, inspired the so-called JKO scheme
to approximate these diffusion processes via an implicit discretization of the
gradient flow in Wasserstein space. Solving the optimization problem associated
to each JKO step, however, presents serious computational challenges. We
introduce a scalable method to approximate Wasserstein gradient flows, targeted

stochastic gradient descent. Unlike previous work, our method does not require

plasmas with relativistic particles, in which turbulence can be driven by an
arbitrary mixture of solenoidal and compressive motions. For example,
turbulence in hot accretion flows may be driven solenoidally by the
magnetorotational instability or compressively by spiral shock waves. It is
important to understand the role of the driving mechanism on kinetic turbulence
and the associated particle energization. In this work, we compare
particle-in-cell simulations of solenoidally driven turbulence with similar
simulations of compressively driven turbulence. We focus on plasma that has an
initial beta of unity, relativistically hot electrons, and varying ion
temperature. Apart from strong large-scale density fluctuations in the
compressive case, the turbulence statistics are similar for both drives, and
the bulk plasma is described reasonably well by an isothermal equation of
state. We find that nonthermal particle acceleration is more efficient when
turbulence is driven compressively. In the case of relativistically hot ions,
both driving mechanisms ultimately lead to similar power-law particle energy
distributions, but over a different duration. In the case of non-relativistic
ions, there is significant nonthermal particle acceleration only for
compressive driving. Additionally, we find that the electron-to-ion heating
ratio is less than unity for both drives, but takes a smaller value for
compressive driving. We demonstrate that this additional ion energization is
associated with the collisionless damping of large-scale compressive modes via
perpendicular electric fields.

Transconductance-to-current ratio is obtained from MOSFET transfer
characteristics measured at low to high drain voltage. Based on the

obtained over the whole range of drain voltage for ideal, long-channel MOSFETs.
The method reveals a distinct increase of threshold voltage versus drain

benefits from moderate inversion operation, where high-field effects, such as
vertical field mobility reduction and series resistances, are minimal. The
present method is applicable over the full range of drain voltage, is fully

the encoding space, the distribution of signals from within a neighborhood is
distinguishable from the distribution of non-neighboring signals. Our
motivation stems from the medical field, where the ability to model the dynamic
nature of time series data is especially valuable for identifying, tracking,
and predicting the underlying patients' latent states in settings where
labeling data is practically impossible. We compare our method to recently

quantum computer is to design a physical device that keeps the error rate for
each quantum processing operation low. These errors can originate from the
accuracy of quantum manipulation, such as the sweeping of a gate voltage in
solid state qubits or the duration of a laser pulse in optical schemes. Errors
also result from decoherence, which is often regarded as more crucial in the
sense that it is inherent to the quantum system, being fundamentally a
consequence of the coupling to the external environment.
  Grouping small collections of qubits into clusters with symmetries can
protect parts of the calculation from decoherence. We use 4-level cores with a
straightforward generalization of discrete rotational symmetry, omega-rotation
invariance, to encode pairs of coupled qubits and universal 2-qubit logical
gates. We include quantum errors as a main source of decoherence, and show that
symmetry makes logical operations particularly resilient to untimely
anisotropic qubit rotations. We propose a scalable scheme for universal quantum
computation where cores play the role of quantum-computational transistors,
quansistors.
  Initialization and readout are achieved by coupling to leads. The external
leads are explicitly considered and are assumed to be the other main source of
decoherence. We show that quansistors can be dynamically decoupled from the
leads by tuning their internal parameters, giving them the versatility required
to act as controllable quantum memory units. With this dynamical decoupling,
logical operations within quansistors are also symmetry-protected from unbiased
noise in their parameters. We identify technologies that could implement
omega-rotation invariance. Many of our results can be generalized to
higher-level omega-rotation-invariant systems, or adapted to clusters with
other symmetries.

  Super-Resolution and Image Denoising",,,"10.1109/TSP.2021.3127679",,"eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In this paper, we propose a regularization technique for noisy-image
super-resolution and image denoising. Total variation (TV) regularization is
adopted in many image processing applications to preserve the local smoothness.
However, TV prior is prone to oversmoothness, staircasing effect, and contrast
losses. Nonlocal TV (NLTV) mitigates the contrast losses by adaptively
weighting the smoothness based on the similarity measure of image patches.
Although it suppresses the noise effectively in the flat regions, it might
leave residual noise surrounding the edges especially when the image is not
oversmoothed. To address this problem, we propose the bilateral spectrum
weighted total variation (BSWTV). Specially, we apply a locally adaptive shrink
coefficient to the image gradients and employ the eigenvalues of the covariance
matrix of the weighted image gradients to effectively refine the weighting map
and suppress the residual noise. In conjunction with the data fidelity term
derived from a mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise model, the objective function is
decomposed and solved by the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
algorithm. In order to remove outliers and facilitate the convergence
stability, the weighting map is smoothed by a Gaussian filter with an
iteratively decreased kernel width and updated in a momentum-based manner in
each ADMM iteration. We benchmark our method with the state-of-the-art
approaches on the public real-world datasets for super-resolution and image
denoising. Experiments show that the proposed method obtains outstanding
performance for super-resolution and achieves promising results for denoising
on real-world images.

the functionalities of traditional software programs. With this as motivation,
we take a modest first step towards improving deep learning programs by jointly
training a generative model to constrain neural network activations to ""decode""

so enables a form of compositionality in neural networks, where one can
recursively compose DecNN with itself to create an ensemble-like model with
uncertainty. In our experiments, we demonstrate applications of this
uncertainty to out-of-distribution detection, adversarial example detection,
and calibration -- while matching standard neural networks in accuracy. We
further explore this compositionality by combining DecNN with pretrained

excitonic effects dominate the low-energy optical and magneto-optical responses

Identifying and measuring these biases at the data level is a challenging

decision outcome, and is based on information theoretic measures for the
accuracy and discriminatory impacts of features. In particular, we first
propose information theoretic measures which quantify the impact of different

marginal contributions of players in a coalitional game. Finally, we design a

control problem in which the goal is to minimize the CVaR of a maximum random
cost subject to a Borel-space Markov decision process. The objective represents
the maximum departure from a desired operating region averaged over a given
fraction of the worst cases. This problem provides a safety criterion for a
stochastic system that is informed by both the probability and severity of the
potential consequences of the system's behavior. In contrast, existing safety
analysis frameworks apply stage-wise risk constraints or assess the probability
of constraint violation without quantifying the potential severity of the
violation. To the best of our knowledge, the problem of interest has not been
solved. To solve the problem, we propose and study a family of stochastic
dynamic programs on an augmented state space. We prove that the optimal CVaR of
a maximum random cost enjoys an equivalent representation in terms of the
solutions to these dynamic programs under appropriate assumptions. For each
dynamic program, we show the existence of an optimal policy that depends on the
dynamics of an augmented state under the assumptions. In a numerical example,
we illustrate how our safety analysis framework is useful for assessing the
severity of combined sewer overflows under precipitation uncertainty.

solution to finding the $K$-best dependency trees. This is arguably a more

presence or absence of atomic Li has served as an indicator of the nearby
H-burning boundary at about $75\,M_{\rm J}$ between brown-dwarfs and very
low-mass stars. Historically the ""Lithium test"", a search for the presence and
strength of the Li line at 670.8 nm, has been a marker if an object has a
substellar mass with stellar-like spectral energy distribution (e.g., a
late-type M dwarf). While the Li test could in principle also be used to
distinguish masses of later-type L-T dwarfs, Li is predominantly no longer
found as an atomic gas, but rather a molecular species such as LiH, LiF, LiOH,
and LiCl in their cooler atmospheres. L- and T-type brown dwarfs are also quite
faint at 670 nm and thus challenging targets for high resolution spectroscopy.
But only recently have experimental molecular line lists become available for
the molecular Li species, allowing molecular Li mass discrimination. In this
study, we generated the latest opacity of each of these Li-bearing molecules
and performed thermochemical equilibrium atmospheric composition calculation of

First, we advance a new argument for why it can be problematic to remove

that the resulting explanations are socially misaligned. The crux of the

results in more socially aligned explanations and metrics. Second, we compare
among five approaches for removing features from model inputs. We find that
some methods produce more OOD counterfactuals than others, and we make
recommendations for selecting a feature-replacement function. Finally, we
introduce four search-based methods for identifying FI explanations and compare
them to strong baselines, including LIME, Anchors, and Integrated Gradients.
Through experiments with six diverse text classification datasets, we find that
the only method that consistently outperforms random search is a Parallel Local
Search (PLS) that we introduce. Improvements over the second-best method are as
large as 5.4 points for Sufficiency and 17 points for Comprehensiveness. All

different fluids or phases. In many cases the dynamics of the interface
determines the behavior of the flow. In a coarse, or reduced order model, it
may therefore be important to retain a sharp interface for the resolved scales.
Here, a process to coarsen or filter fully resolved numerical solutions for
incompressible multiphase flows while retaining a sharp interface is examined.
The different phases are identified by an index function that takes different
values in each phase and is coarsened by solving a constant coefficient
diffusion equation, while tracking the interface contour. Small flows scales of
one phase, left behind when the interface is moved, are embedded in the other
phase by solving another diffusion equation with a modified diffusion
coefficient that is zero at the interface location to prevent diffusion across
the interface, plus a pressure like equation to enforce incompressibility of
the coarse velocity field. Examples of different levels of coarsening are
shown. A simulation of a coarse model, where small scales are treated as a
homogeneous mixture, results in a solution that is similar to the filtered
fully resolved field for the early time Rayleigh-Taylor instability.

  Some chapters report joint work",,,,"q-bio.NC cond-mat.dis-nn cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Invariant object recognition is one of the most fundamental cognitive tasks
performed by the brain. In the neural state space, different objects with
stimulus variabilities are represented as different manifolds. In this
geometrical perspective, object recognition becomes the problem of linearly
separating different object manifolds. In feedforward visual hierarchy, it has
been suggested that the object manifold representations are reformatted across
the layers, to become more linearly separable. Thus, a complete theory of
perception requires characterizing the ability of linear readout networks to
classify object manifolds from variable neural responses.
  A theory of the perceptron of isolated points was pioneered by E. Gardner who
formulated it as a statistical mechanics problem and analyzed it using replica
theory. In this thesis, we generalize Gardner's analysis and establish a theory
of linear classification of manifolds synthesizing statistical and geometric
properties of high dimensional signals. [..] Next, we generalize our theory
further to linear classification of general perceptual manifolds, such as point
clouds. We identify that the capacity of a manifold is determined that
effective radius, R_M, and effective dimension, D_M. Finally, we show
extensions relevant for applications to real data, incorporating correlated
manifolds, heterogenous manifold geometries, sparse labels and nonlinear
classifications. Then, we demonstrate how object-based manifolds transform in
standard deep networks.
  This thesis lays the groundwork for a computational theory of neuronal
processing of objects, providing quantitative measures for linear separability
of object manifolds. We hope this theory will provide new insights into the
computational principles underlying processing of sensory representations in
biological and artificial neural networks.

compare the efficacy of interventions that have been proposed in prior work as
ways of improving data quality. We use multiple-choice question answering as a
testbed and run a randomized trial by assigning crowdworkers to write questions
under one of four different data collection protocols. We find that asking
workers to write explanations for their examples is an ineffective stand-alone
strategy for boosting NLU example difficulty. However, we find that training
crowdworkers, and then using an iterative process of collecting data, sending

means of collecting challenging data. But using crowdsourced, instead of expert
judgments, to qualify workers and send feedback does not prove to be effective.
We observe that the data from the iterative protocol with expert assessments is
more challenging by several measures. Notably, the human--model gap on the

sciences, with direct consequences on quantum metrology and many-body quantum
physics. In this context, two fundamental geometric quantities are known to
play complementary roles: the Fubini-Study metric, which introduces a notion of
distance between quantum states defined over a parameter space, and the Berry
curvature associated with Berry-phase effects and topological band structures.
In fact, recent studies have revealed direct relations between these two
important quantities, suggesting that topological properties can, in special
cases, be deduced from the quantum metric. In this work, we establish general
and exact relations between the quantum metric and the topological invariants
of generic Dirac Hamiltonians. In particular, we demonstrate that topological
indices (Chern numbers or winding numbers) are bounded by the quantum volume
determined by the quantum metric. Our theoretical framework, which builds on
the Clifford algebra of Dirac matrices, is applicable to topological insulators
and semimetals of arbitrary spatial dimensions, with or without chiral
symmetry. This work clarifies the role of the Fubini-Study metric in
topological states of matter, suggesting unexplored topological responses and
metrological applications in a broad class of quantum-engineered systems.

cascade, cascade properties are imprinted on the radiation. Thus, observed
radiation properties must be used to reconstruct the UHE neutrino event.
Analytic Askaryan models have three advantages when used for UHE neutrino

analytic function and observed data. Second, analytic models minimize
computational intensity in simulation packages. Third, analytic models can be
embedded in firmware to enhance the real-time sensitivity of detectors. We

successfully used in various interactive learning systems such as online
advertising, recommender systems, and dynamic pricing. However, they have yet
to be widely adopted in high-stakes application domains, such as healthcare.
One reason may be that existing approaches assume that the underlying
mechanisms are static in the sense that they do not change over different
environments. In many real-world systems, however, the mechanisms are subject
to shifts across environments which may invalidate the static environment
assumption. In this paper, we take a step toward tackling the problem of
environmental shifts considering the framework of offline contextual bandits.
We view the environmental shift problem through the lens of causality and
propose multi-environment contextual bandits that allow for changes in the
underlying mechanisms. We adopt the concept of invariance from the causality
literature and introduce the notion of policy invariance. We argue that policy
invariance is only relevant if unobserved variables are present and show that,
in that case, an optimal invariant policy is guaranteed to generalize across

statistical physics and can be rigorously derived for equilibrium systems.
Their applicability to non-equilibrium systems is, however, debated. Here, we
simulate an active microrheology experiment, in which a spherical colloid is
pulled with a constant external force through a fluid, creating
near-equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium systems. We characterize the
structural and dynamical properties of these systems, and reconstruct an
effective generalized Langevin equation (GLE) for the colloid dynamics.
Specifically, we test the validity of two FDTs: The first FDT relates the
non-equilibrium response of a system to equilibrium correlation functions, and
the second FDT relates the memory friction kernel in the GLE to the stochastic
force. We find that the validity of the first FDT depends strongly on the
strength of the external driving: it is fulfilled close to equilibrium and
breaks down far from it. In contrast, we observe that the second FDT is always
fulfilled. We provide a mathematical argument why this generally holds for
memory kernels reconstructed from a deterministic Volterra equation for
correlation functions, even for non-stationary non-equilibrium systems.
  Motivated by the Mori-Zwanzig formalism, we therefore suggest to impose an
orthogonality constraint on the stochastic force, which is in fact equivalent
to the validity of this Volterra equation. Such GLEs automatically satisfy the
second FDT and are unique, which is desirable when using GLEs for
coarse-grained modeling.

innate chemical reactivity of spin-ordered edge states. Here we present a
general technique for passivating the chemically highly reactive spin-polarized

model for epithelial dynamics, we analysed the impact of where the constriction

size. We find that medial activity, characterised by a reduction in the
reference area in the vertex model, induces symmetry breaking and generates
anisotropic cell shapes, while isotropic cell shapes and larger contractions
occur when the reference perimeter in the model is reduced. When plasticity is
included, sufficiently slow processes of medial contractile activity, compared
with typical apical constriction pulses, can also achieve significant cell
contraction. Finally, we apply the model to describe the active apical

Austrolebias nigripinnis, being able to quantitatively describe the temporal

kinetic energy into the external shocks, then significantly modulate the shapes

standard external shock model to investigate the effects of jet precession on
GRB X-ray afterglows in cases with different parameters, i.e., the steady or
time-dependent jet powers, precession periods, precession angles, and viewing
angles. In the case where the jet powers are in steady or slow decay and the
jet can sweep across the line of sight, shallow decay (or plateau) segments
should appear; otherwise, a giant bump will emerge in the GRB afterglow LCs. We
show that jet precession is a new plausible mechanism of the energy injection

starts by partially reconstructing the geometry from the two depthmaps
associated to a single projection direction. The partial reconstruction
obtained from the depthmaps is completed to a full reconstruction of the point
cloud by sweeping section by section along one direction and encoding the
points which were not contained in the two depthmaps. The main ingredient is a
list-based encoding of the inner points (situated inside the feasible regions)
by a novel arithmetic three dimensional context coding procedure that
efficiently utilizes rotational invariances present in the input data.
State-of-the-art bits-per-voxel results are obtained on benchmark datasets.

Several Theories of Justice and conceptual approaches compete here, and
distributive justice remains a major societal controversy. From an evolutionary
point of view, fair and just exchange can be nothing but ""equivalent"", and this
makes ""strict"" reciprocity (merit, equity) the foundational principle of
justice, both theoretically and empirically. But besides being just, justice
must be effective, efficient, and communicable. Moral reasoning is a
communicative strategy for resolving conflict, enhancing status, and
maintaining cooperation, thereby making justice rather a social bargain and an
optimization problem. Social psychology (intuitions, rules of thumb,
self-bindings) can inform us when and why the two auxiliary principles equality
and need are more likely to succeed than merit would. Nevertheless, both
equality and need are governed by reciprocal considerations, and self-bindings
help to interpret altruism as ""very generalized reciprocity"". The Meritocratic
Principle can be implemented, and its controversy avoided, by concentrating on
""non-merit"", i.e., institutionally draining the wellsprings of undeserved
incomes (economic rents). Avoiding or taxing away economic rents is an
effective implementation of justice in liberal democracies. This would enable
market economies to bring economic achievement and income much more in line,
thus becoming more just.

successful with certain probabilities. Requests arrive to the system seeking
shared entanglements for different sets of users. Each request is for the
creation of shared entanglements for a fixed set of users using link-level
entanglements on a fixed set of links. Requests are processed according to
First-Come-First-Served service discipline and unserved requests are stored in

performed on qubits of link-level entanglements on related links to create a
shared entanglement. For given set of request arrival rates and link-level

of queues of requests. In each time-slot, the scheduler has to schedule
entanglement swapping operations for different sets of users to stabilize the

policy stabilizes the network for all feasible arrival rates. We also provide
numerical results to support our analysis. The analysis of a single quantum

evolution of the system from small filled spheres to hollow, large, thin shells
via the tuning of trap parameters. We analyze the bubble trap spectrum and
states, and track the distinct changes in spectra between radial and angular
modes across the evolution. This separation of the excitation spectrum provides
a basis for quantifying dimensional cross-over to quasi-2D physics at a given
temperature. Using the spectral data, for a range of trap parameters, we
compute the critical temperature for a fixed number of particles to form a BEC.
For a set of initial temperatures, we also evaluate the change in temperature
that would occur in adiabatic expansion from small filled sphere to large thin
shell were the trap to be dynamically tuned. We show that the system cools
during this expansion but that the decrease in critical temperature occurs more
rapidly, thus resulting in depletion of any initial condensate. We contrast our
spectral methods with standard semiclassical treatments, which we find must be
used with caution in the thin-shell limit. With regards to interactions, using
energetic considerations and corroborated through Bogoliubov treatments, we
demonstrate that they would be less important for thin shells due to reduced
density but vortex physics would become more predominant. Finally, we apply our
treatments to traps that realistically model CAL experiments and borrow from
the thermodynamic insights found in the idealized bubble case during adiabatic

set of agents. The main objective of research in the area is to achieve one of
two goals: fairness or efficiency. On the fairness side, envy-freeness is the
central fairness criterion in economics, but envy-free allocations typically do
not exist when the goods are indivisible. A recent line of research shows that
envy-freeness can be achieved if a small quantity of a homogeneous divisible
good (money) is introduced into the system, or equivalently, if transfer
payments are allowed between the agents. A natural question to explore, then,
is whether transfer payments can be used to provide high welfare in addition to
envy-freeness, and if so, how much money is needed to be transferred.
  We show that for general monotone valuations, there always exists an
allocation with transfers that is envy-free and whose Nash social welfare (NSW)
is at least an $e^{-1/e}$-fraction of the optimal Nash social welfare.
Additionally, when the agents have additive valuations, an envy-free allocation
with negligible transfers and whose NSW is within a constant factor of optimal
can be found in polynomial time. Consequently, we demonstrate that the
seemingly incompatible objectives of fairness and high welfare can be achieved
simultaneously via transfer payments, even for general valuations, when the
welfare objective is NSW. On the other hand, we show that a similar result is
impossible for utilitarian social welfare: any envy-freeable allocation that
achieves a constant fraction of the optimal welfare requires non-negligible
transfers. To complement this result we present algorithms that compute an
envy-free allocation with a given target welfare and with bounded transfers.

power-constrained, requiring optimal power-control mechanisms. In this paper,
we consider a multi-tier fog-based IoT architecture where a mobile/static fog
node acts as an amplify and forward relay that transmits received information
from a sensor node to a higher hierarchically-placed static fog device, which
offers some localized services. The outage probability of the presented
scenario was efficiently minimized by jointly optimizing the mobility pattern
and the transmit power of the fog relay. A closed-form analytical expression
for the outage probability was derived. Furthermore, due to the intractability
and non-convexity of the formulated problem, we applied an iterative algorithm
based on the steepest descent method to arrive at a desirable objective.
Simulations reveal that the outage probability was improved by 62.7% in the
optimized-location fixed-power (OLFP) scheme, 79.3% in the optimized-power
fixed-location (OPFL) scheme, and 94.2% in the optimized-location
optimized-power (OLOP) scheme, as against the fixed-location and fixed-power
(FLFP) scheme (i.e., without optimization). Lastly, we present an optimal relay
selection strategy that chooses an appropriate relay node from randomly
distributed relaying candidates.

  In-the-Wild Unsupervised Sound Separation","5 pages, 1 figure. WASPAA 2021",,,,"eess.AS cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Supervised neural network training has led to significant progress on
single-channel sound separation. This approach relies on ground truth isolated
sources, which precludes scaling to widely available mixture data and limits
progress on open-domain tasks. The recent mixture invariant training (MixIT)
method enables training on in-the-wild data; however, it suffers from two
outstanding problems. First, it produces models which tend to over-separate,
producing more output sources than are present in the input. Second, the
exponential computational complexity of the MixIT loss limits the number of
feasible output sources. In this paper we address both issues. To combat
over-separation we introduce new losses: sparsity losses that favor fewer
output sources and a covariance loss that discourages correlated outputs. We
also experiment with a semantic classification loss by predicting weak class
labels for each mixture. To handle larger numbers of sources, we introduce an
efficient approximation using a fast least-squares solution, projected onto the
MixIT constraint set. Our experiments show that the proposed losses curtail
over-separation and improve overall performance. The best performance is
achieved using larger numbers of output sources, enabled by our efficient MixIT
loss, combined with sparsity losses to prevent over-separation. On the FUSS
test set, we achieve over 13 dB in multi-source SI-SNR improvement, while
boosting single-source reconstruction SI-SNR by over 17 dB.

investigates an EV charging scheduling problem to reduce the charging cost

alternative to legacy passwords for user authentication. Recently, a growing
body of work shows that voice biometrics is vulnerable to spoofing through
replay attacks, where an adversary tries to spoof voice authentication systems
by using a pre-recorded voice sample collected from a genuine user. To this
end, we propose VoiceGesture, a liveness detection solution for voice
authentication on smart devices such as smartphones and smart speakers.
VoiceGesture detects a live user by leveraging both the unique articulatory
gesture of the user when speaking a passphrase and the audio hardware advances
on these smart devices. Specifically, our system re-uses a pair of built-in
speaker and microphone on a smart device as a Doppler radar, which transmits a
high-frequency acoustic sound from the speaker and listens to the reflections
at the microphone when a user speaks a passphrase. Then we extract Doppler
shifts resulted from the user's articulatory gestures for liveness detection.
VoiceGesture is practical as it requires neither cumbersome operations nor
additional hardware but a speaker and a microphone commonly available on smart
devices that support voice input. Our experimental evaluation with 21
participants and different smart devices shows that VoiceGesture achieves over
99% and around 98% detection accuracy for text-dependent and text-independent

provides insight into nonlocal phonon heat transport. We report simulations of
pulse propagation in one dimension. The 1d case has tricky anomalies, but
provides the simplest pictures of the evolution from initially ballistic toward
longer time diffusive propagation. Our results show surprising details, such as
diverse results from different definitions of atomistic local energy, and
failure to exhibit pure diffusion at long times. Boltzmann phonon gas theory,
including external energy insertion, is applied to this
inherentlytime-dependent and nonlocal problem. The solution, using relaxation
time approximation for impurity scattering, does not closely agree with the
simulated results.

substitutional doping of known ferroelectrics, as slight changes to local

morphotropic phase boundary, and electromechanical responses. In this work, we
demonstrate that moving to the strong limit of compositional complexity in an

The electric field generation, material transfer, and particle amount and size

Therefore, with brightness values exhibiting an unknown synthesis of systemic,

However, the way of taking one sentence as input prevents the modeling of
non-sequential global context, which is useful especially when local context
information is limited or ambiguous. To this end, we propose a model called
Global Context enhanced Document-level NER (GCDoc) to leverage global
contextual information from two levels, i.e., both word and sentence. At
word-level, a document graph is constructed to model a wider range of
dependencies between words, then obtain an enriched contextual representation
for each word via graph neural networks (GNN). To avoid the interference of
noise information, we further propose two strategies. First we apply the
epistemic uncertainty theory to find out tokens whose representations are less
reliable, thereby helping prune the document graph. Then a selective auxiliary
classifier is proposed to effectively learn the weight of edges in document
graph and reduce the importance of noisy neighbour nodes. At sentence-level,
for appropriately modeling wider context beyond single sentence, we employ a
cross-sentence module which encodes adjacent sentences and fuses it with the
current sentence representation via attention and gating mechanisms. Extensive

great passenger demand pressure. During peak hours, it is common to see
oversaturated conditions (i.e., passenger demand exceeds network capacity),
which bring significant operational risks and safety issues. A popular control
intervention is to restrict the entering rate during peak hours by setting up
out-of-station queueing with crowd control barriers. The \textit{out-of-station
waiting} can make up a substantial proportion of total travel time but is not
well-studied in the literature. Accurate quantification of out-of-station
waiting time is important to evaluating the social benefit and cost of service
scheduling/optimization plans; however, out-of-station waiting time is
difficult to estimate because it is not a part of smart card transactions. In
this study, we propose an innovative method to estimate the out-of-station
waiting time by leveraging the information from a small group of transfer
passengers -- those who transfer from nearby bus routes to the metro station.
Based on the estimated transfer time for this small group, we first infer the
out-of-station waiting time for all passengers by developing a Gaussian Process
regression with a Student-$t$ likelihood and then use the estimated
out-of-station waiting time to build queueing diagrams. We apply our method to
the Tiantongyuan North station of Beijing metro as a case study; our results
show that the maximum out-of-station waiting time can reach 15 minutes, and the
maximum queue length can be over 3000 passengers. Our results suggest that
out-of-station waiting can cause significant travel costs and thus should be
considered in analyzing transit performance, mode choice, and social benefits.
To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first quantitative study for
out-of-station waiting time.

Firstly, we decouple the optimization problem and design the active beamforming
for a given IRS configuration. Then we transform the optimization problem of
the IRS-based passive beamforming design into a tractable non-convex
quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). For solving the transformed
problem, we give an approximate solution based on the technique of widely used
semidefinite relaxation (SDR). We also propose a low-complexity iterative

Finally, considering the practical scenario of discrete phase shifts at the

configurations of the molecules around a vacancy in solid CO2 with the Pa3
structure (phase I) were calculated by the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation
technique at T < 200 K and at a nominal pressure of P = 1 atm using lattice
constants determined in reference to experimental data. For the intermolecular
potential, the Kihara model of a rod-shape core with zero diameter was used.
For theoretical consistency, however, the lattice constant should be determined
by a pressure-constant MC simulation, i.e. by the NPT simulation. It was
anticipated that the NPT simulation, successful for monoatomic molecular
fluids, might not work straightforwardly for solid CO2 because of the
non-spherical molecular shape and interactions. In fact, it was found in the
present work that the protocol of the standard NPT simulation had to be
modified for solid CO2 to achieve an equilibrium lattice constant, given an
external pressure, within practical computer time and capacity. The modified
protocol was used to calculate the P-V relation at 1 bar and from 2 to 10 GPa
at which a structural phase transition is known to take place. The temperature
was fixed at 200 K. As a result, the calculated P-V relation was similar to

Bayesian regression models are used to obtain predictions and return a variance

constrained optimization problem based on this variance function to dynamically
generate a reference density signal which guides the robots to uncertain areas
to collect new data, and design mean-field feedback-based control laws such
that the robots' density converges to this reference signal. We also show that
the proposed feedback law is robust to density estimation errors in the sense
of input-to-state stability. Simulations are included to verify the

training non-autoregressive translation (NAT) models. However, there exists a
discrepancy on low-frequency words between the distilled and the original data,
leading to more errors on predicting low-frequency words. To alleviate the
problem, we directly expose the raw data into NAT by leveraging pretraining. By
analyzing directed alignments, we found that KD makes low-frequency source
words aligned with targets more deterministically but fails to align sufficient
low-frequency words from target to source. Accordingly, we propose reverse KD
to rejuvenate more alignments for low-frequency target words. To make the most
of authentic and synthetic data, we combine these complementary approaches as a
new training strategy for further boosting NAT performance. We conduct
experiments on five translation benchmarks over two advanced architectures.
Results demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly and
universally improve translation quality by reducing translation errors on
low-frequency words. Encouragingly, our approach achieves 28.2 and 33.9 BLEU

rationality, the most likely outcomes are given by an equilibrium, e.g. a Nash
equilibrium. In many practical settings, games are influenced by context, i.e.
additional data beyond the control of any agent (e.g. weather for traffic and
fiscal policy for market economies). Often only game equilibria are observed,
while the players' true cost functions are unknown. This work introduces Nash
Fixed Point Networks (N-FPNs), a class of implicit neural networks that learn
to predict the equilibria given only the context. The N-FPN design fuses
data-driven modeling with provided constraints on the actions available to
agents. N-FPNs are compatible with the recently introduced Jacobian-Free
Backpropagation technique for training implicit networks, making them
significantly faster to train than prior models. N-FPNs can exploit novel
constraint decoupling to avoid costly projections. Provided numerical examples
show the efficacy of N-FPNs on atomic and non-atomic games (e.g. traffic

edge states (Chern number C=2). Calculated results show that monolayer
$\mathrm{Li_2Fe_2SSe}$ possesses robust QAH states against biaxial strain and
electronic correlations. Compared to LiFeX, the glide mirror $G_z$ of

achieved at room temperature in Janus monolayer $\mathrm{Li_2Fe_2SSe}$. Similar

mining that has been studied extensively both for its theoretical richness and
its many practical applications. In this paper we introduce a new family of
dense subgraph objectives, parameterized by a single parameter $p$, based on
computing generalized means of degree sequences of a subgraph. Our objective
captures both the standard densest subgraph problem and the maximum $k$-core as
special cases, and provides a way to interpolate between and extrapolate beyond
these two objectives when searching for other notions of dense subgraphs. In
terms of algorithmic contributions, we first show that our objective can be
minimized in polynomial time for all $p \geq 1$ using repeated submodular
minimization. A major contribution of our work is analyzing the performance of
different types of peeling algorithms for dense subgraphs both in theory and
practice. We prove that the standard peeling algorithm can perform arbitrarily
poorly on our generalized objective, but we then design a more sophisticated
peeling method which for $p \geq 1$ has an approximation guarantee that is
always at least $1/2$ and converges to 1 as $p \rightarrow \infty$. In
practice, we show that this algorithm obtains extremely good approximations to
the optimal solution, scales to large graphs, and highlights a range of
different meaningful notions of density on graphs coming from numerous domains.
Furthermore, it is typically able to approximate the densest subgraph problem
better than the standard peeling algorithm, by better accounting for how the
removal of one node affects other nodes in its neighborhood.

prediction, we propose a novel scheme to fuse segmentation with anchor-free
detection in a single stage network, which enables the efficient training and
better convergence. After parsing the facades into shape grammars, we employ an

have a close connection to causality. While many existing approaches make use
of the property that causal features are invariant across domains, we consider
the causal invariance of the average causal effect of the features to the

the domain generalization problem by introducing invariance of the mechanisms

the most common tools to simulate quantum annealing on classical hardware.
Nevertheless, it is in principle highly non-trivial whether or not this
classical algorithm can correctly reproduce the quantum dynamics of quantum
annealing, particularly in the diabatic regime. We study this problem
numerically through the generalized Kibble-Zurek mechanism of defect
distribution in the simplest ferromagnetic one-dimensional transverse-field
Ising model with and without coupling to the environment. We find that,in the
absence of coupling to the environment, simulated quantum annealing correctly
describes the annealing-time dependence of the average number of defects, but a
detailed analysis of the defect distribution shows clear deviations from the
theoretical prediction. When the system is open (coupled to the environment),
the average number of defects does not follow the theoretical prediction but is
qualitatively compatible with the numerical result by the infinite
time-evolving block decimation combined with the quasi-adiabatic propagator
path integral, which is valid in a very short time region. The distribution of
defects in the open system turns out to be not far from the theoretical
prediction. It is surprising that the classical stochastic dynamics of
simulated quantum annealing ostensibly reproduce some aspects of the quantum
dynamics. However, a serious problem is that it is hard to predict for which
physical quantities in which system it is reliable. Those results suggest the
necessity to exert a good amount of caution in using simulated quantum
annealing to study the detailed quantitative aspects of the dynamics of quantum

different goal requirements and system dynamics has been extensively studied,
and is gaining recent attention in the realm of machine and reinforcement
learning. However, in particular when using a large number of agents,
constructing a least-restrictive collision avoidance policy is of utmost
importance for both classical and learning-based methods. In this paper, we
propose a Least-Restrictive Collision Avoidance Module (LR-CAM) that evaluates
the safety of multi-agent systems and takes over control only when needed to
prevent collisions. The LR-CAM is a single policy that can be wrapped around
policies of all agents in a multi-agent system. It allows each agent to pursue
any objective as long as it is safe to do so. The benefit of the proposed
least-restrictive policy is to only interrupt and overrule the default
controller in case of an upcoming inevitable danger. We use a Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) based Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) to enable the LR-CAM to
account for a varying number of agents in the environment. Moreover, we propose
an off-policy meta-reinforcement learning framework with a novel reward
function based on a Hamilton-Jacobi value function to train the LR-CAM. The
proposed method is fully meta-trained through a ROS based simulation and tested
on real multi-agent system. Our results show that LR-CAM outperforms the
classical least-restrictive baseline by 30 percent. In addition, we show that
even if a subset of agents in a multi-agent system use LR-CAM, the success rate
of all agents will increase significantly.

problem because it often amounts to the inference of in ductive quantified loop
invariants which, in some cases, may not even be firstorder expressible. In
this paper, we suggest a novel verification tech nique that is based on
induction on userdefined rank of program states as an alternative to
loopinvariants. Our technique, dubbed inductive rank reduction, works in two
steps. Firstly, we simplify the verification problem and prove that the program
is correct when the input state con tains an input array of length B or less,
using the length of the array as the rank of the state. Secondly, we employ a
squeezing function g which converts a program state sigma with an array of
length > B to a state g(sigma) containing an array of length minus 1 or less.
We prove that when g satisfies certain natural conditions then if the program
violates its specification on sigma then it does so also on g(sigma). The
correctness of the program on inputs with arrays of arbitrary lengths follows
by induction. We make our technique automatic for array programs whose length
of execution is proportional to the length of the input arrays by (i) perform
ing the first step using symbolic execution, (ii) verifying the conditions
required of g using Z3, and (iii) providing a heuristic procedure for syn

conceptually simple linear-quadratic (convex) settings in discrete and
continuous time to nonlinear and distributed settings including hybrid,
stochastic, and infinite-dimensional systems. Put differently, essentially the
entire spectrum of dynamic systems can be considered in the MPC framework with
respect to both -- system theoretic analysis and tailored numerics. Moreover,
recent developments in machine learning also leverage MPC concepts and
learning-based and data-driven MPC have become highly active research areas.
  However, this evident and continued success renders it increasingly complex
to live up to industrial expectations while enabling graduate students for
state-of-the-art research in teaching MPC. Hence, this position paper attempts
to trigger a discussion on teaching MPC. To lay the basis for a fruitful
debate, we subsequently investigate the prospect of covering MPC in
undergraduate courses; we comment on teaching textbooks; and we discuss the
increasing complexity of research-oriented graduate teaching of~MPC.

kHz, using the John A. Galt Telescope (diameter 25.6 m) at the Dominion Radio
Astrophysical Observatory, as part of the Global Magneto-Ionic Medium Survey.
The survey covered 72% of the sky, declinations -30 to +87 degrees at all right
ascensions. The intensity scale was absolutely calibrated, based on the flux
density and spectral index of Cygnus A. Polarization angle was calibrated using
the extended polarized emission of the Fan Region. Data are presented as
brightness temperatures with angular resolution 40'. Sensitivity in Stokes Q
and U is 45 mK rms in a 1.18 MHz band. We have applied rotation measure
synthesis to the data to obtain a Faraday depth cube of resolution 150 radians

Faraday depth up to a width of 110 radians per square metre are represented.
The maximum detectable Faraday depth is +/- 20,000 radians per square metre.

network-based speech enhancement can generate `processing artifacts' as a side
effect of the enhancement, which degrades ASR performance. For example, it is
well known that single-channel noise reduction for non-speech noise
(non-overlapping speech) often does not improve ASR. Likewise, the processing
artifacts may also be detrimental to ASR in some conditions when processing
overlapping speech with a separation/extraction method, although it is usually

analyze ASR performance on observed and enhanced speech at various noise and

emergence of coordinated collective behavior of animal groups from simple
interaction rules. A common, simplifying assumption of such collective movement
models, is the consideration of individual agents moving with a constant speed.
In this work we critically re-asses this assumption underlying a vast majority
of collective movement models. First, we show the omnipresent speed variability
observed in different species of live fish and artificial agents (RoboFish).
Based on theoretical considerations accounting for inertia and rotational
friction, we derive a functional dependence of the turning response of
individuals on their instantaneous speed (confirmed by experimental data). We
investigate how the interplay of variable speed and speed-dependent turning
affects self-organized collective behavior by implementing an agent-based model
which accounts for both effects. We show, that besides average speed, the
individual speed variability may have a dramatic impact on the emergent
collective dynamics, as two groups differing only in their speed variability,
and being otherwise identical in all other behavioral parameters, can be in two
fundamentally different stationary states. We find that the local coupling
between group polarization and individual speed is strongest at the
order-disorder transition. Furthermore, we demonstrate a decrease in
polarization with group size for groups of individuals with variable speed, and
a sudden decrease in mean individual speed at a critical group size (N=4 for
Voronoi interactions) linked to a topological transition from an all-to-all to
a distributed spatial interaction network. Overall, our work highlights the
importance to account for fundamental kinematic constraints in general, and
variable speed in particular, when modeling self-organized collective dynamics.

the problem of estimating the bottom impermeable boundary to an inviscid,

The need to consider the shallow-water regime arises from the ill-posed nature

which, both fluid velocities and the bottom-boundary profile, may be accurately
recovered assuming an a priori relatively inaccurate guess for the bottom
boundary. We achieve this by considering two separate inverse problems: one to
deduce the bottom-boundary from velocities and the surface deviation, and
another to recover the velocities from the surface deviation and an approximate
bottom-boundary. The former is a classic inverse problem that requires the

in early development stages of safety critical systems. In industry,
development artefacts such as components or units, are often reused from
existing artefacts to save time and costs. When development artefacts are
reused, their existing safety analysis models are an important input for an
early safety assessment for the new system, since they already provide a valid
model. Component fault trees support such reuse strategies by a compositional
horizontal approach. But current development strategies do not only divide
systems horizontally, e.g., By encapsulating different functionality into
separate components and hierarchies of components, but also vertically, e.g.
Into software and hardware architecture layers. Current safety analysis
methodologies, such as component fault trees, do not support such vertical
layers. Therefore, we present here a methodology that is able to divide safety
analysis models into different layers of a systems architecture. We use so
called Architecture Layer Failure Dependencies to enable component fault trees
on different layers of an architecture. These dependencies are then used to
generate safety evidence for the entire system and over all different
architecture layers. A case study applies the approach to hardware and software

refines an infinite-state system using first-order linear temporal logic

inferring the planetary compositions and thus valuable for the studies of
formation and migration models. However, the M-R relation alone is not enough
for planetary characterization due to the dependence of it on other confounding
variables. This paper provides a non-trivial extension of the M-R relation by
including the incident flux as an additional variable. By using Bayesian
hierarchical modeling (BHM) that leverages the flexibility of finite mixture
models, a probabilistic mass-radius-flux relationship (M-R-F relation) is
obtained based on a sample of 319 exoplanets. We find that the flux has
nonnegligible impact on the M-R relation, while such impact is strongest for
hot-Jupiters. On the population level, the planets with higher level of flux
tend to be denser, and high flux could trigger significant mass loss for plants
with radii larger than $13R_{\oplus}$. As a result, failing to account for the
flux in mass prediction would cause systematic over or under-estimation. With
the recent advent of computing power, although a lot of complex statistical
models can be fitted using Monte Carlo methods, it has largely remain illusive
how to validate these complex models when the data are observed with large
measurement errors. We present two novel methods to examine model assumptions,
which can be used not only for the models we present in this paper but can also

the anomalous magnetic moments of the light leptons, namely, $e$ and $\mu$.
Moreover, to make our scenario friendly to a Dirac like neutrino and also for a
consistent dark matter phenomenology, we specifically add a singlet scalar
($S$) and a singlet fermion ($\psi$) in the set-up. However, the singlet states
also induce a meaningful contribution in other charged lepton processes. A
discrete symmetry $\mathcal {Z}_2 \times \mathcal {Z}_2^\prime$ has been
imposed under which all the SM particles are even while the new particles may
be assumed to have odd charges. In a bottom-up approach, with a minimal
particle content, we systematically explore the available parameter space in
terms of couplings and masses of the new particles. Here a number of
observables associated with the SM leptons have been considered, e.g., masses
and mixings of neutrinos, $(g-2)$ anomalies of $e$, $\mu$, charged lepton
flavor violating (cLFV) observables and the dark matter (DM) phenomenology of a
singlet-doublet dark matter. Neutrinos, promoted as the Dirac type states,
acquire mass at one loop level after the discrete $\mathcal{Z}_2^\prime$
symmetry gets softly broken, while the unbroken $\mathcal{Z}_2$ keeps the dark
matter stable. The mixing between the singlet $\psi$ and the doublet vector
lepton can be constrained to satisfy the electroweak precision observables and
the spin independent (SI) direct detection (DD) cross section of the dark

severely ill hypoxemic Covid-19 patients are treated with various forms of
low-flow oxygen therapy (0-15 L/min), including interfaces such as a nasal
cannula, Hudson mask, venturi-mask, and non-rebreather masks. When 15L/min of
pure oxygen flow is not sufficient for the patient, treatment guidelines
suggest non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or high-flow nasal
oxygenation (HFNO) as the next stage of treatment. However, administering HFNO
in the general wards of a low-resource hospital is difficult due to several
factors, including difficulty in operation, unavailability of electric power
outlets, and frequent maintenance. Therefore, in many cases, the highest level
of care a patient receives in the general ward is 15L/min of oxygen on a
Non-Rebreather Mask. With a shortage of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds, this is
a major problem since intermediate forms of treatments are simply not available

oxygen to increase the volumetric flow rate by entraining atmospheric air. The

promise of existing PLL solutions is that there are sufficient partial-label
(PL) samples for training. However, it is more common than not to have just few
PL samples at hand when dealing with new tasks. Furthermore, existing few-shot
learning algorithms assume precise labels of the support set; as such,
irrelevant labels may seriously mislead the meta-learner and thus lead to a
compromised performance. How to enable PLL under a few-shot learning setting is
an important problem, but not yet well studied. In this paper, we introduce an
approach called FsPLL (Few-shot PLL). FsPLL first performs adaptive distance
metric learning by an embedding network and rectifying prototypes on the tasks
previously encountered. Next, it calculates the prototype of each class of a
new task in the embedding network. An unseen example can then be classified via
its distance to each prototype. Experimental results on widely-used few-shot

superior performance than the state-of-the-art methods across different

a sequence of satellite-based quantum key distribution (SatQKD) missions,
allowing any two ground nodes to have a shared secure key. Accordingly, we
develop a comprehensive framework for the dynamic simulation of SatQKD and
consider scheduling QKD downlink in future space-based quantum communication

atmosphere effects makes our framework more realistic. Incorporated with the
local meteorological data to channel loss model, the cloud cover contribution
to transmission disturbance is quantified to realize a quasi-experimental
scenario. We provide a trade-off consideration between the duration available
for communications and its corresponding average link loss during one orbit,
which could be used to support decisions involving the locations of ground
stations and the selection of the orbital parameters for a quantum satellite.
Our work also shows that satellite downlink schedule could allow for the
possibility to consider strategies for different SatQKD missions such as
extending connection for distant ground nodes, prioritized delivery, or
promoting keys utilization, which can be used as a guideline to support
decisions for future satellite application.

addressing the issue of perception and path planning, in this paper, we
introduce OctoPath , which is an encoder-decoder deep neural network, trained
in a self-supervised manner to predict the local optimal trajectory for the
ego-vehicle. Using the discretization provided by a 3D octree environment
model, our approach reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification
problem with a configurable resolution. During training, OctoPath minimizes the
error between the predicted and the manually driven trajectories in a given
training dataset. This allows us to avoid the pitfall of regression-based
trajectory estimation, in which there is an infinite state space for the output
trajectory points. Environment sensing is performed using a 40-channel
mechanical LiDAR sensor, fused with an inertial measurement unit and wheels
odometry for state estimation. The experiments are performed both in simulation
and real-life, using our own developed GridSim simulator and RovisLab's
Autonomous Mobile Test Unit platform. We evaluate the predictions of OctoPath
in different driving scenarios, both indoor and outdoor, while benchmarking our
system against a baseline hybrid A-Star algorithm and a regression-based
supervised learning method, as well as against a CNN learning-based optimal
path planning method.

  multi-stability greatly improves learning","16 pages, 21 pages total, 20 figures",,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Training recurrent neural networks is known to be difficult when time
dependencies become long. Consequently, training standard gated cells such as
the gated recurrent unit (GRU) and the long short-term memory (LSTM) on
benchmarks where long-term memory is required remains an arduous task. In this
work, we show that although most classical networks have only one stable
equilibrium at initialisation, learning on tasks that require long-term memory
only occurs once the number of network stable equilibria increases; a property
known as multistability. Multistability is often not easily attained by
initially monostable networks, making learning of long-term dependencies
difficult. This insight leads to the design of a novel, general way to
initialise any recurrent network connectivity through a procedure called
""warmup"" to improve its capability to learn arbitrarily long time dependencies.
This initialisation procedure is designed to maximise network reachable
multistability, i.e., the number of attractors within the network that can be
reached through relevant input trajectories. Warming up is performed before
training, using stochastic gradient descent on a specifically designed loss. We
show on information restitution, sequence classification, and reinforcement
learning benchmarks that warming up greatly improves recurrent neural network
performance for multiple recurrent cell types, but sometimes impedes precision.
We therefore introduce a parallel recurrent network structure with a partial
warmup that is shown to greatly improve learning of long-term dependencies in
sequences while maintaining high levels of precision. This approach provides a
general framework for improving learning abilities of any recurrent cell type
when long-term memory is required.

very general setting, with nonlinear terms admitting maximal monotone graphs

condition, with the boundary graph that dominates the other one. It turns out
that in the limiting procedure the solution of the problem looses some

majorization-minimization (MM) technique. We derive two surrogate functions,
one quadratic and one linear. Both lead to efficient iterative algorithms that

concerted dynamics of several cellular components, including protrusions,
adhesions with the environment, and the cell nucleus. However, it remains
poorly understood how the dynamic interplay of these components and the cell
polarity determine the emergent migration behavior at the cellular scale. Here,
we combine data-driven inference with a mechanistic bottom-up approach to
develop a model for protrusion and polarity dynamics in confined cell
migration, revealing how the cellular dynamics adapt to confining geometries.
Specifically, we use experimental data of joint protrusion-nucleus migration
trajectories of cells on confining micropatterns to systematically determine a
mechanistic model linking the stochastic dynamics of cell polarity,
protrusions, and nucleus. This model indicates that the cellular dynamics adapt
to confining constrictions through a switch in the polarity dynamics from a
negative to a positive, self-reinforcing feedback loop. Our model further
reveals how this feedback loop leads to stereotypical cycles of
protrusion-nucleus dynamics that drive the migration of the cell through
constrictions. These cycles are disrupted upon perturbation of cytoskeletal
components, indicating that the positive feedback is controlled by cellular
migration mechanisms. Our data-driven theoretical approach therefore identifies
polarity feedback adaptation as a key mechanism in confined cell migration.

However, in SAC, maximizing the entropy-augmented objective may degrade the

the agent to learn from both failures and successes. We apply HER to SAC and
propose SACHER to improve the learning performance of SAC. More precisely,
SACHER achieves the desired optimal outcomes faster and more accurately than
SAC, since HER improves the sample efficiency of SAC. We apply SACHER to the

generates the optimal navigation path of the UAV under various obstacles in
operation. Specifically, we show the effectiveness of SACHER in terms of the
tracking error and cumulative reward in UAV operation by comparing them with
those of state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, SAC and DDPG. Note that SACHER in UAV
navigation and control problems can be applied to arbitrary models of UAVs.

obtained by tailoring the clustering scheme to the final task performed by the

automatically extract the important attributes of the data space that are
inherently relevant to the subsequent decision-making entity, and partition the
data space based on these attributes instead of partitioning the data space

observation that a large portion of questions in current datasets have shortcut

hypothesis, we carefully design two synthetic datasets with annotations that
indicate whether a question can be answered using shortcut solutions. We
further propose two new methods to quantitatively analyze the learning
difficulty regarding shortcut and challenging questions, and revealing the
inherent learning mechanism behind the different performance between the two
kinds of questions. A thorough empirical analysis shows that MRC models tend to
learn shortcut questions earlier than challenging questions, and the high
proportions of shortcut questions in training sets hinder models from exploring

approach characterizes the localization performance by its asymptotic behavior
as the number of satellites gets large while assuming a dense network. Using
the law of large numbers, we derive closed-form expressions for the asymptotic
Cramer Rao bound (CRB) from which we draw valuable insights. The resulting
expressions depend solely on the network statistics and are not a function of a
particular network configuration. We consider two types of estimators. The
first uses the exact statistical model, and hence employs both timing and
amplitude information. The second estimator ignores the amplitudes and hence
uses only time difference of arrival (TDOA) information. The asymptotic CRB
indicates that for practical system setup, a TDOA estimator approaches the
performance of the ideal estimator. For both estimators, the localization
accuracy improves as satellites get closer to Earth. The latter finding is
essential in light of the proliferation of low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites and
motivates a further study of localization-performance in such networks.
Besides, we show that the vertical localization accuracy is lower than the
horizontal accuracy and is also more sensitive to the receiver field-of-view.

have indicated that about 15% of the neutron counts by PSNM are due to
interactions (mostly in the lead producer) of GeV-range protons among the
atmospheric secondary particles from cosmic ray showers, which can be detected
by the scintillator and silicon detectors. Those detectors can provide a timing
trigger for measurement of the propagation time distribution of such neutrons
as they scatter and propagate through the NM64, processes that are similar
whether the interaction was initiated by an energetic proton (for 15% of the
count rate) or neutron (for 80% of the count rate). This propagation time
distribution underlies the time delay distribution between successive neutron
counts, from which we can determine the leader fraction (inverse multiplicity),
which has been used to monitor Galactic cosmic ray spectral variations over
$\sim$1-40 GV. Here we have measured and characterized the propagation time
distribution from both the experimental setup and Monte Carlo simulations of
atmospheric secondary particle detection. We confirm a known propagation time
distribution with a peak (at $\approx$70 microseconds) and tail over a few ms,
dominated by neutron counts. We fit this distribution using an analytic model
of neutron diffusion and absorption, for both experimental and Monte Carlo
results. In addition we identify a group of prompt neutron monitor pulses that
arrive within 20 microseconds of the charged-particle trigger, of which a
substantial fraction can be attributed to charged-particle ionization in a
proportional counter, according to both experimental and Monte Carlo ...

predicts the properties of a molecule with prior knowledge-guided subgraph.
Modeling higher-order connectivities in molecules is necessary as changes in
both the pair-wise and higher-order interactions among atoms results in the
change of molecular properties. Many approaches have attempted to model the
higher-order connectivities. However, those methods relied heavily on
data-driven approaches, and it is difficult to determine if the utilized
subgraphs contain any properties of interest or have any significance on the
molecular properties. Hence, we propose MolHMPN to utilize the functional group
prior knowledge and model the pair-wise and higher-order connectivities among
the atoms in a molecule. Molecules can contain many types of functional groups,
which affect the properties the molecules. For example, the toxicity of a
molecule is associated with toxicophores, such as nitroaromatic groups and
thiourea. MolHMPN uses functional groups to construct hypergraphs, modifies the
hypergraph using domain knowledge-guided modification scheme, embeds the graph
and hypergraph inputs using a hypergraph message passing (HyperMP) layer, and
uses the updated graph and hypergraph embeddings to predict the properties of
the molecules. Our model provides a way to utilize prior knowledge in chemistry
for molecular properties prediction tasks, and balance between the usage of
prior knowledge and data-driven modification adaptively. We show that our model
is able to outperform the other baseline methods for most of the dataset, and
show that using domain knowledge-guided data-learning iseffective.

  This work addresses the complexity of verifying safety properties, such as

characterized the service obtained by one flow of interest by means of a convex
strict service curve. These bounds do not make any assumptions on the
interfering traffic hence are pessimistic when the interfering traffic is
constrained by some arrival curves. For such cases, two improvements were
proposed. The former, by Soni et al., uses a correction term derived from a
semi-rigorous heuristic; unfortunately, these bounds are incorrect, as we show
by exhibiting a counter-example. The latter, by Bouillard, rigorously derive
convex strict service curves for DRR that account for the arrival curve
constraints of the interfering traffic. In this paper, we improve on these
results in two ways. First, we derive a non-convex strict service curve for DRR
that improves on Boyer et al. when there is no arrival constraint on the
interfering traffic. Second, we provide an iterative method to improve any
strict service curve (including Bouillard's) when there are arrival constraints

fundamental graph-algorithmic construct, with numerous applications for
computing approximate shortest paths and related problems in distributed,
streaming and dynamic settings.
  Known constructions of near-additive emulators enable one to trade between
their sparsity (i.e., number of edges) and the additive stretch $\beta$.
Specifically, for any pair of parameters $\epsilon >0$, $ \kappa=1,2,\dots$,
one can have a $(1+\epsilon,\beta)$-emulator with $O(n^{1+1/\kappa})$ edges,
with $\beta = \left(\frac{\log \kappa}{\epsilon}\right)^{\log \kappa}$. At
their sparsest, these emulators employ $c\cdot n$ edges, for some constant
$c\geq 2$.
  We tighten this bound, and show that in fact precisely $n^{1+1/\kappa}$ edges
suffice.
  In particular, our emulators can be \emph{ultra-sparse}, i.e., we can have an
emulator with $n+o(n)$ edges and $\beta = \left(\frac{\log {\log n}}{\epsilon
}\right)^{{\log {\log n}}(1+o(1))}$.
  We also devise a distributed deterministic algorithm in the CONGEST model
that builds these emulators in low polynomial time (i.e., in $O(n^\rho)$ time,
for an arbitrarily small constant parameter $\rho >0$).
  Finally, we also improve the state-of-the-art distributed deterministic
\congest-model construction of
  $(1+\epsilon,\beta)$-spanners devised in the PODC'19 paper

n^{1+1/\kappa})$ edges, i.e., at their sparsest they employ
  $ O\left(\frac{\log {\log n}}{\epsilon }\right)^{{\log {\log n}}}\cdot n$
edges. In this paper, we devise an efficient distributed deterministic
CONGEST-model algorithm that builds such spanners with $O(n^{1+1/\kappa})$
edges for $\kappa = O\left(\frac{\log n}{\log ^{(3)}n}\right)$. At their

that it requires a fixed background reference frame for spacetime. In fact,

operationally well-defined measurement statistics. We do this by postulating an
arbitrary probability distribution of measurement outcomes across discrete

requiring that this distribution be invariant under any permutation of
laboratories. We find (a) that one still obtains nontrivial, indefinite causal
structures with background independence, (b) that we lose the idea of local
operations in distinct laboratories, but can recover it by encoding a reference

invariance imposes surprising symmetry constraints that, although formally

natural to ask whether the neural architectures used for the task have
inductive biases towards modeling particular types of languages. Investigation
of these biases has proved complicated due to the many variables that appear in
the experimental setup. Languages vary in many typological dimensions, and it
is difficult to single out one or two to investigate without the others acting
as confounders. We propose a novel method for investigating the inductive
biases of language models using artificial languages. These languages are
constructed to allow us to create parallel corpora across languages that differ
only in the typological feature being investigated, such as word order. We then
use them to train and test language models. This constitutes a fully controlled
causal framework, and demonstrates how grammar engineering can serve as a
useful tool for analyzing neural models. Using this method, we find that
commonly used neural architectures exhibit different inductive biases: LSTMs
display little preference with respect to word ordering, while transformers
display a clear preference for some orderings over others. Further, we find
that neither the inductive bias of the LSTM nor that of the transformer appears

is realized due to the interplay of the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the
Coulomb interactions. Here, we show that in ferromagnetic solids the effective
SOC and the orbital magnetic moment can be dramatically enhanced by a factor of
$1/[1-(2U^\prime-U-J_H)\rho_0]$, where $U$ and $U^\prime$ are the on-site
Coulomb interaction within the same oribtals and between different orbitals,
respectively, $J_H$ is the Hund coupling, and $\rho_0$ is the average density
of states. This factor is obtained by using the two-orbital as well as
five-orbital Hubbard models with SOC. We also find that the spin polarization
is more favorable than the orbital polarization, being consistent with
experimental observations. This present work provides a fundamental basis for
understanding the enhancements of SOC and orbital moment by Coulomb
interactions in ferromagnets, which would have wide applications in
spintronics.

single execution of a policy. In this case, to apply multi-objective
reinforcement learning, the expected utility of the returns must be optimised.
Various scenarios exist where a user's preferences over objectives (also known
as the utility function) are unknown or difficult to specify. In such
scenarios, a set of optimal policies must be learned. However, settings where
the expected utility must be maximised have been largely overlooked by the
multi-objective reinforcement learning community and, as a consequence, a set
of optimal solutions has yet to be defined. In this paper we address this
challenge by proposing first-order stochastic dominance as a criterion to build
solution sets to maximise expected utility. We also propose a new dominance
criterion, known as expected scalarised returns (ESR) dominance, that extends
first-order stochastic dominance to allow a set of optimal policies to be
learned in practice. We then define a new solution concept called the ESR set,
which is a set of policies that are ESR dominant. Finally, we define a new
multi-objective distributional tabular reinforcement learning (MOT-DRL)
algorithm to learn the ESR set in a multi-objective multi-armed bandit setting.

to learn resource-poor languages in a sample-efficient fashion. Nevertheless,
the properties of these languages are often not well represented by those
available during training. Hence, we argue that the i.i.d. assumption ingrained
in MAML makes it ill-suited for cross-lingual NLP. In fact, under a
decision-theoretic framework, MAML can be interpreted as minimising the
expected risk across training languages (with a uniform prior), which is known
as Bayes criterion. To increase its robustness to outlier languages, we create
two variants of MAML based on alternative criteria: Minimax MAML reduces the
maximum risk across languages, while Neyman-Pearson MAML constrains the risk in
each language to a maximum threshold. Both criteria constitute fully
differentiable two-player games. In light of this, we propose a new adaptive
optimiser solving for a local approximation to their Nash equilibrium. We
evaluate both model variants on two popular NLP tasks, part-of-speech tagging

classes: Random sampling/stochastic approaches and optimization-based
approaches. While the latter have the advantage of working in real-world
scenarios where no full grid models exist, when relying on naive sampling
strategies, they suffer from poor coverage of the edges of the FOR due to

the convolution problem by drawing sample values from a multivariate Dirichlet

underlying optimal power flow problems of the optimization-based approach by

means of synthetic feeders, we compare the two proposed FOR identification
methods with regard to how well the FOR is covered and number of power flow

the case, albeit to different degrees, for three distinct PLM architectures.
However, causes do not always need to be implicit -- when a cause is explicitly
stated in a subordinate clause, an incongruent IC bias associated with the verb
in the main clause leads to a delay in human processing. We hypothesize that
the temporary challenge humans face in integrating the two contradicting
signals, one from the lexical semantics of the verb, one from the

by replacing their schema-related words with manually selected synonyms that

dramatically drops by eliminating such explicit correspondence between NL

approaches utilizes additional synonym annotations for table schemas by
modifying the model input, while the second category is based on adversarial

spacetime dimensions $\ge 2$ whose target space has a geometrical structure
that suitably generalizes Poisson or twisted Poisson manifolds. Assuming a
field content comprising a set of scalar fields accompanied by gauge fields of
degree $(1,p-1,p)$ we determine a generic Wess-Zumino topological field theory
in $p+1$ dimensions with background data consisting of a Poisson 2-vector, a
$(p+1)$-vector $R$ and a $(p+2)$-form $H$ satisfying a specific geometrical
condition that defines a $H$-twisted $R$-Poisson structure of order $p+1$. For
this class of theories we demonstrate how a target space covariant formulation
can be found by means of an auxiliary connection without torsion. Furthermore,
we study admissible deformations of the generic class in special spacetime
dimensions and find that they exist in dimensions 2, 3 and 4. The
two-dimensional deformed field theory includes the twisted Poisson sigma model,
whereas in three dimensions we find a more general structure that we call
bi-twisted $R$-Poisson. This extends the twisted $R$-Poisson structure of order
3 by a non-closed 3-form and gives rise to a topological field theory whose
covariant formulation requires a connection with torsion and includes a twisted
Poisson sigma model in three dimensions as a special case. The relation of the
corresponding structures to differential graded Q-manifolds based on the degree
shifted cotangent bundle $T^{\ast}[p]T^{\ast}[1]M$ is discussed, as well as the
obstruction to them being QP-manifolds due to the Wess-Zumino term.

employed corrections to the mean-field interaction energy and especially to the
Thomas-Fermi kinetic energy functional are necessary for reliably predicting
properties of trapped mesoscopic Fermi gases. The density patterns of the
ground state survive at low finite temperatures and confirm the Stoner-type
polarization behavior across a universal interaction parameter, albeit with
substantial quantitative differences that originate in the trapping potential

configurations that are energetically comparable to the ground-state density
profiles and are thus likely to be observed in experiments. We argue that our
density-functional approach can be easily applied to interacting
multi-component Fermi gases in general.

extragalactic distances of early-type and late-type eclipsing binaries or,
potentially, for extracting planetary parameters of late-type stars hosting
planets. Various SBCRs have been implemented so far, but strong discrepancies
in terms of precision and accuracy still exist in the literature. We aim to
develop a precise SBCR for early-type B and A stars using selection criteria,
based on stellar characteristics, and combined with homogeneous interferometric
angular diameter measurements. We also improve SBCRs for late-type stars, in
particular in the Gaia photometric band. We observed 18 early-type stars with
the VEGA interferometric instrument, installed on the CHARA array. We then
applied additional criteria on the photometric measurements, together with
stellar characteristics diagnostics in order to build the SBCRs. We calibrated
a SBCR for subgiant and dwarf early-type stars. The RMS of the relation is
$\sigma_{F_{V_{0}}} = 0.0051\,$mag, leading to an average precision of 2.3% on
the estimation of angular diameters, with 3.1% for $V-K < -0.2\,$mag and 1.8%
for $V-K > -0.2\,$mag. We found that the conversion between Johnson-$K$ and
2MASS-$K_s$ photometries is a key issue for early-type stars. Following this
result, we have revisited our previous SBCRs for late-type stars by calibrating
them with either converted Johnson-$K$ or 2MASS-$K_s$ photometries. We also
improve the calibration of these SBCRs based on the Gaia photometry. The
expected precision on the angular diameter using our SBCRs for late-type stars
ranges from 1.0% to 2.7%. By reaching a precision of 2.3% on the estimation of
angular diameters for early-type stars, significant progress has been made to
determine extragalactic distances using early-type eclipsing binaries.

solar wind was measured at the same latitudes and radial distances. We identify
two streams measured at the same heliocentric distance ($\sim$0.13au) and
latitude ($\sim$-3.5$^{\circ}$) across these encounters to reduce spatial
evolution effects. By comparing the plasma of each stream, we confirm that they
are not dominated by variable transient events, despite PSP's proximity to the
heliospheric current sheet. Both streams are consistent with a previous slow
Alfv\'enic solar wind study once radial effects are considered, and appear to
originate at the Southern polar coronal hole boundary. We also show that the
switchback properties are not distinctly different between these two streams.
Low $\alpha$-particle abundance ($\sim$ 0.6 %) is observed in the encounter 5
stream, suggesting that some physical mechanism must act on coronal hole
boundary wind to cause $\alpha$-particle depletion. Possible explanations for
our observations are discussed, but it remains unclear whether the depletion
occurs during the release or the acceleration of the wind. Using a flux tube
argument, we note that an $\alpha$-particle abundance of $\sim$ 0.6 % in this
low velocity wind could correspond to an abundance of $\sim$ 0.9 % at 1 au.
Finally, as the two streams roughly correspond to the spatial extent of a
switchback patch, we suggest that patches are distinct features of coronal hole
wind.

evolution stage AGN -- specifically narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies. Radio
imaging observations of all of the sources enable a division to jetted and
non-jetted sources, and exploiting this we show that the ionized gas properties
are significantly influenced by the presence of the jets, as we often find the
[O III] lines (blue-)shifted with respect to their restframe wavelength. We
also show how the radio morphology and the radio spectral index do not seem to
play a role in the origin of the [O III] shifts, thus suggesting that the
source inclination is not relevant to the lines displacement. We do not find a
strong relation between the [O III] line properties and the bolometric
luminosity, suggesting that within our sample radiatively driven outflows do
not seem to have a significant contribution to the [O III] line kinematics. We
finally suggest that [O~ III] shifts may be a good proxy to identify the
presence of relativistic jets. Additional studies, especially with
integral-field spectroscopy, will provide a deeper insight into the relation
between jets and their environment in early evolution stage AGN.

are dominated by collisions. In each of these events, grains exchange
electrical charge via triboelectric effects. This enhances the stability of
particle aggregates. Aim. Dielectric grains are easily charged by collisions.
Here, we investigate whether a charge is capable of inducing an aggregation of
particles and we consider how collision properties, such as ticking velocities
and collisional cross-sections, are altered. Methods. We explored aggregation
in microgravity experiments based on the observation of the motion of
submillimeter (submm) grains following many collisions. In the process, grains
attract each other, collide, stick, and ultimately form small aggregates.
Results. We observed a bottom-up formation of irregular aggregates from submm
grains. While some of the observed trajectories during the approach of grains
reflect the presence of a pure Coulomb potential, the motion is not always in
agreement with pure Kepler motion. Higher-order potentials of multipole charge
distributions stand as a plausible explanation for this behavior. An immediate
consequence of charging is that the particles continue to stick to each other
at velocities of $\sim 10 \, \rm cm/s,$ while surface forces of neutral grains
are only expected to allow sticking below $\sim 1 \, \rm mm/s$. No bouncing
collision was observed among hundreds of collisions in the given parameter
range. Applied to early phases of planet formation, the forming aggregates are
therefore the first steps in a new growth phase beyond the traditional bouncing
barrier in planet formation.

keying (BPSK) modulated signals in a massive multiple-input multiple-output

correlated and not perfectly known. We use the linear minimum mean squared

Coreset Selection (OCS), a simple yet effective method that selects the most

Besides, action-irrelated noises brought by camera movement will also harm the

Saliency Integration (TSI) block, which mainly contains a Salient Motion
Excitation (SME) module and a Cross-perception Temporal Integration (CTI)

spatial-level local-global motion modeling, where the saliency alignment and
pyramidal motion modeling are conducted successively between adjacent frames to
capture motion dynamics with fewer noises caused by misaligned background. CTI
is designed to perform multi-perception temporal modeling through a group of
separate 1D convolutions respectively. Meanwhile, temporal interactions across
different perceptions are integrated with the attention mechanism. Through
these two modules, long short-term temporal relationships can be encoded
efficiently by introducing limited additional parameters. Extensive experiments
are conducted on several popular benchmarks (i.e., Something-Something V1 & V2,

understand what role the magnetic fields play in setting the power of
relativistic jets in AGN. We have performed multi-frequency (4-24 GHz) VLBA
phase-referencing observations of the radio-intermediate quasar III Zw 2 using
three nearby calibrators as reference sources to estimate jet magnetic flux by
measuring the core-shift effect. By combining the self-referencing core-shift
of each calibrator with the phase-referencing core-shifts, we obtained an upper
limit of 0.16 mas for the core-shift between 4 and 24 GHz in III Zw 2. By
assuming equipartition between magnetic and particle energy densities and
adopting the flux-freezing approximation, we further estimated the upper limit
for both magnetic field strength and poloidal magnetic flux threading the black
hole. We find that the upper limit to the measured magnetic flux is smaller by
at least a factor of five compared to the value predicted by the magnetically
arrested disk (MAD) model. An alternative way to derive the jet magnetic field
strength from the turnover of the synchrotron spectrum leads to an even smaller
upper limit. Hence, the central engine of III Zw 2 has not reached the MAD
state, which could explain why it has failed to develop a powerful jet, even
though the source harbours a fast-spinning black hole. However, it generates an
intermittent jet, which is possibly triggered by small scale magnetic field
fluctuations as predicted by the magnetic flux paradigm of Sikora & Begelman
(2013). We propose here that combining black hole spin measurements with
magnetic field measurements from the VLBI core-shift observations of AGN over a
range of jet powers could provide a strong test for the dominant factor setting
the jet power relative to the accretion power available.

compressions of high-dimensional data. First we introduce a general
distribution-dependent upper-bound on the excess risk, framed in terms of a
natural notion of compressibility. This bound is independent of the dimension
of the original data representation, and explains the in-built regularisation
effect of the compressive approach. We then instantiate this general bound to
classification and regression tasks, considering Johnson-Lindenstrauss mappings
as the compression scheme. For each of these tasks, our strategy is to develop
a tight upper bound on the compressibility function, and by doing so we
discover distributional conditions of geometric nature under which the
compressive algorithm attains minimax-optimal rates up to at most
poly-logarithmic factors. In the case of compressive classification, this is
achieved with a mild geometric margin condition along with a flexible moment
condition that is significantly more general than the assumption of bounded
domain. In the case of regression with strongly convex smooth loss functions we
find that compressive regression is capable of exploiting spectral decay with
near-optimal guarantees. In addition, a key ingredient for our central upper
bound is a high probability uniform upper bound on the integrated deviation of
dependent empirical processes, which may be of independent interest.

increasing the nonlinearity, the system self-organizes into an incoherent
localized structure that contains ""hidden"" coherent soliton states. The
solitons are ""hidden"" in the sense that they are fully immersed in random wave
fluctuations: The radius of the soliton is much larger than the correlation
radius of the incoherent fluctuations while its peak amplitude is of the same
order of such fluctuations. Accordingly, the solitons can hardly be identified
in the usual spatial or spectral domains, while their existence is clearly
unveiled in the phase-space representation. Our multi-scale theory based on
coupled coherent-incoherent wave turbulence formalisms reveals that the hidden
solitons are stabilized and trapped by the incoherent localized structure.
Furthermore, hidden binary soliton systems are identified numerically and
described theoretically. The regime of hidden solitons is of potential interest
for self-gravitating Boson models of ""fuzzy"" dark matter. It also sheds new
light on the quantum-to-classical correspondence with gravitational
interactions. The hidden solitons can be observed in nonlocal nonlinear optics
experiments through the measurement of the spatial spectrogram.

localized cortical regions from implanted tetrodes in the human or animal
brain. The LFP signals are curves observed at multiple tetrodes which are
implanted across a patch on the surface of the cortex. Hence, they can be
treated as multi-group functional data, where the trajectories collected across
temporal epochs from one tetrode are viewed as a group of functions. In many
cases, multi-tetrode LFP trajectories contain both global variation patterns
(which are shared in common to all groups, due to signal synchrony) and
isolated variation patterns (common only to a small subset of groups), and such
structure is very informative to the analysis of such data. Therefore, one goal
in this paper is to develop an efficient procedure that is able to capture and
quantify both global and isolated features. We propose a novel tree-structured
functional principal components (filt-fPC) analysis through finite-dimensional
functional representation - specifically via filtration. A major advantage of
the proposed filt-fPC method is the ability to extract the components that are
common to multiple groups (or tetrodes) in a flexible ""multi-resolution"" manner
and simultaneously preserve the idiosyncratic individual components of
different tetrodes. The proposed filt-fPC approach is highly data-driven and no
""ground-truth"" model pre-specification is needed, making it a suitable approach
for analyzing multi-group functional data that is complex. In addition, the
filt-fPC method is able to produce a parsimonious, interpretable, and efficient
low dimensional representation of multi-group functional data with orthonormal
basis functions. Here, the proposed filt-fPCA method is employed to study the
impact of a shock (induced stroke) on the synchrony structure of the rat brain.

we study non-helically forced shear flows, which exhibit large-scale dynamo

that in the earlier study we used magnetic forcing to mimic small-scale dynamo

Moreover, the runtime of the temporarily disconnecting deterministic leader

reconnecting algorithm is as fast as previous randomized algorithms. When
comparing to previous deterministic algorithms, we note that some of the
previous work assumed weaker schedulers. Still, the runtime of all the previous

pooling module. For the feature extraction module, we fuse the features from
intermediate layers of the convolutional neural network (CNN) network into
final quality-aware feature representation, which enables the model to make
full use of visual information from low-level to high-level. Specifically, the
structure and texture similarities of feature maps extracted from all
intermediate layers are calculated as the feature representation for the full
reference (FR) VQA model, and the global mean and standard deviation of the
final feature maps fused by intermediate feature maps are calculated as the
feature representation for the no reference (NR) VQA model. For the quality
regression module, we use the fully connected (FC) layer to regress the
quality-aware features into frame-level scores. Finally, a
subjectively-inspired temporal pooling strategy is adopted to pool frame-level
scores into the video-level score. The proposed model achieves the best
performance among the state-of-the-art FR and NR VQA models on the Compressed

longer operational periods. At the same, the battery technologies have not
improved fast enough to cope with these increasing needs. This makes the energy
consumption issue increasingly challenging and thus, miniaturized energy
harvesting devices have emerged to complement traditional energy sources.
Nevertheless, the harvested energy fluctuates significantly during the node
operation, increasing uncertainty in actually available energy resources.
Recently, approaches in energy management have been developed, in particular
using reinforcement learning approaches. However, in reinforcement learning,
the algorithm's performance relies greatly on the reward function. In this
paper, we present two contributions. First, we explore five different reward
functions to identify the most suitable variables to use in such functions to
obtain the desired behaviour. Experiments were conducted using the Q-learning
algorithm to adjust the energy consumption depending on the energy harvested.
Results with the five reward functions illustrate how the choice thereof
impacts the energy consumption of the node. Secondly, we propose two additional
reward functions able to find the compromise between energy consumption and a
node performance using a non-fixed balancing parameter. Our simulation results
show that the proposed reward functions adjust the node's performance depending

opposite to the more familiar case of disordered crystals. Individual ions in a
crystal are subjected essentially to nearest-neighbor interactions. In
contrast, the systems studied in this paper have all their degrees of freedom
coupled to each other. Thus, the problem of linearized small oscillations of
such systems involves two full positive-definite and non-commuting matrices, as
opposed to the sparse matrices associated with disordered crystals.
Consequently, the familiar methods for determining the averaged vibrational
spectra of disordered crystals, introduced many years ago by Dyson and Schmidt,
are inapplicable for highly connected disordered systems. In this paper we
apply random matrix theory to calculate the averaged vibrational spectra of
such systems, in the limit of infinitely large system size. We calculate the
average spectrum of the product of two positive definite random matrices by
means of free probability theory techniques. We also show that this problem is
intimately related with quasi-hermitian random matrix theory. The analytical
results we obtain for the spectrum agree well with our numerical results. The
latter also exhibit oscillations at the high-frequency band edge, which fit
well the Airy kernel pattern. We also compute inverse participation ratios of
the corresponding amplitude eigenvectors and demonstrate that they are all
extended, in contrast with conventional disordered crystals. In addition to
matrix model analysis, we study the vibrational spectra of various
multi-segmented disordered pendula, as concrete realizations of highly
connected mechanical systems. A universal feature of the density of vibration
modes, common to both pendula and the matrix model, is that it tends to a
non-zero constant at vanishing frequency.

between the GP and kernel communities, making it difficult to transfer results
from one side to the other. Our motivation is to remove this obstacle, by
clarifying the connections between the sparse approximations for GPs and kernel
methods. In this work, we study the two popular approaches, the Nystr\""om and
SVGP approximations, in the context of a regression problem, and establish
various connections and equivalences between them. In particular, we provide an
RKHS interpretation of the SVGP approximation, and show that the Evidence Lower

of the regularization continuation method such that it does not need to compute
the correction step for preserving the feasibility other than the previous

preconditioning technique to improve its computational efficiency in the
well-posed phase, and it uses the inverse of the regularized two-sided
projection of the Lagrangian Hessian as the pre-conditioner to improve its
robustness. Numerical results also show that the new method is more robust and
faster than the traditional optimization method such as the alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM),the sequential quadratic programming

The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) framework provides an increasingly popular answer
to such problems, by seeking a low-distortion, geometry-preserving assignment
between these points. As a non-convex, quadratic generalization of optimal
transport (OT), GW is NP-hard. While practitioners often resort to solving GW
approximately as a nested sequence of entropy-regularized OT problems, the
cubic complexity (in the number $n$ of samples) of that approach is a
roadblock. We show in this work how a recent variant of the OT problem that
restricts the set of admissible couplings to those having a low-rank
factorization is remarkably well suited to the resolution of GW: when applied
to GW, we show that this approach is not only able to compute a stationary
point of the GW problem in time $O(n^2)$, but also uniquely positioned to
benefit from the knowledge that the initial cost matrices are low-rank, to
yield a linear time $O(n)$ GW approximation. Our approach yields similar

for a wide range of vision tasks, outperforming traditional machine learning
(ML) methods. Consequently, they drew a lot of attention in the neuroimaging
field in particular for phenotype prediction or computer-aided diagnosis.
However, most of the current studies often deal with small single-site cohorts,
along with a specific pre-processing pipeline and custom CNN architectures,
which make them difficult to compare to. We propose an extensive benchmark of
recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D CNN, evaluating also the benefits of data
augmentation and deep ensemble learning, on both Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM)
pre-processing and quasi-raw images. Experiments were conducted on a large
multi-site 3D brain anatomical MRI data-set comprising N=10k scans on 3
challenging tasks: age prediction, sex classification, and schizophrenia
diagnosis. We found that all models provide significantly better predictions
with VBM images than quasi-raw data. This finding evolved as the training set
approaches 10k samples where quasi-raw data almost reach the performance of
VBM. Moreover, we showed that linear models perform comparably with SOTA CNN on
VBM data. We also demonstrated that DenseNet and tiny-DenseNet, a lighter
version that we proposed, provide a good compromise in terms of performance in
all data regime. Therefore, we suggest to employ them as the architectures by
default. Critically, we also showed that current CNN are still very biased
towards the acquisition site, even when trained with N=10k multi-site images.
In this context, VBM pre-processing provides an efficient way to limit this
site effect. Surprisingly, we did not find any clear benefit from data
augmentation techniques. Finally, we proved that deep ensemble learning is well
suited to re-calibrate big CNN models without sacrificing performance.

research areas, ranging from social to natural sciences. Until recently, SEM
software was either commercial or restricted to niche languages, and the lack
of SEM packages compatible with more mainstream programming languages was dire.
To combat that, we introduced a Python package semopy 1 that surpassed other
state-of-the-art software in terms of performance and estimation accuracy. Yet,
it was lacking in functionality and its usage was burdened with unnecessary
boilerplate code. Here, we introduce a complete overhaul of semopy that
improves upon the previous results and comes with lots of new capabilities.
Furthermore, we propose a novel SEM model that combines in itself a notion of
random effects from linear mixed models (LMMs) to model numerous phenomena,
such as spatial data, time series or population stratification in genetics.

methods for calculating excitation energies such as time-dependent density
functional theory (TDDFT), are computationally demanding and thus limited to
moderate system sizes. Here, we introduce a new variation of constrained DFT
(CDFT), wherein the constraint corresponds to a particular transition (T), or
combination of transitions, between occupied and virtual orbitals, rather than
a region of the simulation space as in traditional CDFT. We compare T-CDFT with
TDDFT and $\Delta$SCF results for the low lying excited states (S$_{1}$ and
T$_{1}$) of a set of gas phase acene molecules and OLED emitters, as well as
with reference results from the literature. At the PBE level of theory, T-CDFT
outperforms $\Delta$SCF for both classes of molecules, while also proving to be
more robust. For the local excitations seen in the acenes, T-CDFT and TDDFT
perform equally well. For the charge-transfer (CT)-like excitations seen in the
OLED molecules, T-CDFT also performs well, in contrast to the severe energy
underestimation seen with TDDFT. In other words, T-CDFT is equally applicable
to both local excitations and CT states, providing more reliable excitation
energies at a much lower computational cost than TDDFT. T-CDFT is designed for
large systems and has been implemented in the linear scaling BigDFT code. It is
therefore ideally suited for exploring the effects of explicit environments on
excitation energies, paving the way for future simulations of excited states in
complex realistic morphologies, such as those which occur in OLED materials.

our network is straightforward to train requiring no restarts and has an online

proposed to fix certain issues with canonical PSO algorithm such as premature
convergence, excessive influence of global best solution, and oscillation.
  Multiple experiments are conducted using Olympus benchmark to compare the
efficacy of algorithms. Canonical PSO hyperparameters are first tuned to
prioritize exploration in early phase and exploitation in late phase. Next, a
two-stage multi-swarm PSO (2SPSO) is used where multiple-swarms of the first
stage collapse into a single swarm in the second stage. Finally, MS2PSO with
multiple stages and multiple swarms is used in which swarms recursively
collapse after each stage. Multiple swarm strategy ensures that diversity is
retained within the population and multiple modes are explored. Staging ensures
that local optima found during initial stage does not lead to premature
convergence. Optimization test case comprises of 90 control variables and a
twenty year period of flow simulation. It is observed that different algorithm
designs have their own benefits and drawbacks. Multiple swarms and stages help
algorithm to move away from local optima, but at the same time they may also
necessitate larger number of iterations for convergence. Both 2SPSO and MS2PSO
are found to be helpful for problems with high dimensions and multiple modes
where greater degree of exploration is desired.

their popularity from various (sub)categories? We analyse local indegree

  The citation (indegree) of a patent within the same category indicates its
internal popularity, while a cross-category citation indicates its external
popularity. We analyze the internal and external indegree distributions at each
level of USPCN hierarchy to learn how the internal and external popularity of
patents varies across (sub)categories.
  We find that all (sub)categories have local preferences that decide internal

However, music information retrieval research has almost exclusively focused on

to the model as inputs, constraining the use of these models to the few cases
where data from all modalities are available. To the best of our knowledge, no
existing model has the ability to take inputs from varying modalities, e.g.

the use of cross-modal retrieval as a pretext task to learn modality-agnostic

independent of modality. We select instrument classification as an example task

sounds as input, and perform comparably to sound-only or image-only
classifiers. Furthermore, we explore the case when there is limited labeled

from other modalities. We are able to achieve almost 70% of best performing

architecture that increase model capacity have reliably translated into gains

reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often use small MLPs, and gains in
performance typically originate from algorithmic innovations. It is natural to
hypothesize that small datasets in RL necessitate simple models to avoid
overfitting; however, this hypothesis is untested. In this paper we investigate
how RL agents are affected by exchanging the small MLPs with larger modern
networks with skip connections and normalization, focusing specifically on
actor-critic algorithms. We empirically verify that naively adopting such
architectures leads to instabilities and poor performance, likely contributing
to the popularity of simple models in practice. However, we show that dataset
size is not the limiting factor, and instead argue that instability from taking
gradients through the critic is the culprit. We demonstrate that spectral
normalization (SN) can mitigate this issue and enable stable training with
large modern architectures. After smoothing with SN, larger models yield
significant performance improvements -- suggesting that more ""easy"" gains may
be had by focusing on model architectures in addition to algorithmic
innovations.

crucial for their evolution and affect planet formation. Recent observations
suggest weak turbulence in the disk's outer regions. However, the physical
mechanism of turbulence in these outer regions remains uncertain. The vertical
shear instability (VSI) is a promising mechanism to produce turbulence in
disks. Aims. Our aim is to study the observability of the gas velocity
structure produced by the VSI via CO kinematics with ALMA. Methods. We perform
global 3D hydrodynamical simulations of a VSI-unstable disk. We post-process
the simulation results with radiative transfer calculations, and produce
synthetic predictions of CO rotational emission lines. Following, we compute
the line of sight velocity map, and its deviations from a sub-Keplerian
equilibrium solution. We explore the detectability of the VSI by identifying
kinematic signatures using realistic simulated observations. Results. Our 3D
simulations of the VSI show the steady state dynamics of the gas in great
detail. From the velocity structure we infer a turbulent stress value of
$\alpha_{r\phi}=1.4 \times 10^{-4}$. On large scales, we observe velocity
deviations of 50 m s$^{-1}$ as axisymmetric rings. We find optimal conditions
at $i \lesssim 20^{\circ}$ to trace for the kinematic structures of the VSI. We
found that current diagnostics to constrain gas turbulence from non-thermal
broadening of the line emission are not applicable to anisotropic VSI
turbulence. Conclusions. The detection of kinematic signatures produced by the
VSI is possible with ALMA. Observations including an extended antenna
configuration combined with the highest spectral resolution available are
needed for robust detection. The characterization of the large-scale velocity
perturbations is required to constrain the turbulence level produced by the VSI

differential equations with multiple small parameters. In addition, we develop
a general conceptual framework to compare and contrast the different results by
proposing a three-step process. First, one specifies the setting and
restrictions of the differential equation problem to be studied and identifies
the relevant small parameters. Second, one defines a notion of equivalence via
a property/observable for partitioning the parameter space into suitable
regions near the singular limit. Third, one studies the possible asymptotic
singular limit problems as well as perturbation results to complete the
diagrammatic subdivision process. We illustrate this approach for two simple
problems from algebra and analysis. Then we proceed to the review of several
modern double-limit problems including multiple time scales, stochastic
dynamics, spatial patterns, and network coupling. For each example, we
illustrate the previously mentioned three-step process and show that already
double-limit parametric diagrams provide an excellent unifying theme. After
this review, we compare and contrast the common features among the different
examples. We conclude with a brief outlook, how our methodology can help to
systematize the field better, and how it can be transferred to a wide variety
of other classes of differential equations.

second class to the primary currency Ether. Custom currencies are more complex
and more expensive to handle than the primary currency as their accounting is
not natively performed by the underlying ledger, but instead in user-defined
contract code. Furthermore, and quite importantly, transaction fees can only be
paid in Ether.
  In this paper, we focus on being able to pay transaction fees in custom
currencies. We achieve this by way of a mechanism permitting short term
liabilities to pay transaction fees in conjunction with offers of custom
currencies to compensate for those liabilities. This enables block producers to
accept custom currencies in exchange for settling liabilities of transactions
that they process.
  We present formal ledger rules to handle liabilities together with the
concept of babel fees to pay transaction fees in custom currencies. We also
discuss how clients can determine what fees they have to pay, and we present a
solution to the knapsack problem variant that block producers have to solve in
the presence of babel fees to optimise their profits.

Creating new equilibrium configurations irrespective of the presence of a
gravitational field is challenging with applications on earth as well as in
zero-gravity environments. Vibrations are known to alter the shape of liquid
interfaces and to also to change internal dynamics and stability in depth.
Here, we show that vibrations can also create an ""artificial gravity"" in any
direction. We demonstrate that a liquid can maintain an inclined interface when
shaken in an arbitrary direction. A necessary condition for the equilibrium to
occur is the existence of a velocity gradient determined by dynamical boundary
conditions. However, no-slip boundary condition and incompressibility can
perturb the required velocity profile leading to a destabilization of the
equilibrium. We show that liquid layers provide a solution and liquid walls of
several centimeters in height can thus be stabilized. We show that the buoyancy
equilibrium is not affected by the forcing.

exponential growth of computing time, as the number of arms and the horizon

the initial problem into parallelly coordinated one-armed bandit problems. As a
consequence, we obtain a computing time which is essentially linear in the

bound on the regret. For the two-armed bandit case, dynamic programming
provides the exact solution, which is almost matched by the DeCo heuristic.

luminosities and compare them with those derived from the parallaxes of the

  We employ pulsation and evolutionary models, together with observationally

  Excluding 6 outlying stars (e.g., with blending issues) the RRd and Gaia
luminosities correlate well. With the adopted temperature zero point from one
of the works based on the infrared flux method, we find it necessary to
increase the Gaia parallaxes by 0.02 mas to bring the RRd and Gaia luminosities
into agreement. This value is consonant with those derived from studies on
binary stars in the context of Gaia. We examine also the resulting
period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) relation in the 2MASS K band as follows
from the RRd parameters. This leads to the verification of two independently
derived other PLZs. No significant zero point differences are found.
Furthermore, the predicted K absolute magnitudes agree within

target outputs typically come in the form of natural signals, such as labels

spikes. This is done by handcrafting target spiking signals, which in turn
implicitly fixes the mechanisms used to decode spikes into natural signals,
e.g., rate decoding. The arbitrary choice of target signals and decoding rule
generally impairs the capacity of the SNN to encode and process information in
the timing of spikes. To address this problem, this work introduces a hybrid
variational autoencoder architecture, consisting of an encoding SNN and a
decoding Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The role of the decoding ANN is to
learn how to best convert the spiking signals output by the SNN into the target
natural signal. A novel end-to-end learning rule is introduced that optimizes a
directed information bottleneck training criterion via surrogate gradients. We
demonstrate the applicability of the technique in an experimental settings on

at one's disposal to achieve a given goal in the least amount of time possible.
To do so, a speedrun must be planned in advance, or routed, as referred to by
the community. This paper focuses on discovering challenges and defining models
needed when trying to approach the problem of routing algorithmically. To do
so, this paper is split in two parts. The first part provides an overview of
relevant speedrunning literature, extracting vital information and formulating
criticism. Important categorizations are pointed out and a nomenclature is
built to support professional discussion. The second part of this paper then
refers to the actual speedrun routing optimization problem. Different concepts
of graph representations are presented and their potential is discussed.
Visions both for problem modeling as well as solving are presented and assessed
regarding suitability and expected challenges. Finally, a first assessment of
the applicability of existing optimization methods to the defined problem is
made, including metaheuristics/EA and Deep Learning methods.

  Space","To appear in ACL 2021 main conference",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The representation degeneration problem in Contextual Word Representations
(CWRs) hurts the expressiveness of the embedding space by forming an
anisotropic cone where even unrelated words have excessively positive
correlations. Existing techniques for tackling this issue require a learning
process to re-train models with additional objectives and mostly employ a
global assessment to study isotropy. Our quantitative analysis over isotropy
shows that a local assessment could be more accurate due to the clustered
structure of CWRs. Based on this observation, we propose a local cluster-based
method to address the degeneration issue in contextual embedding spaces. We
show that in clusters including punctuations and stop words, local dominant
directions encode structural information, removing which can improve CWRs
performance on semantic tasks. Moreover, we find that tense information in verb
representations dominates sense semantics. We show that removing dominant
directions of verb representations can transform the space to better suit
semantic applications. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed
cluster-based method can mitigate the degeneration problem on multiple tasks.

Griffin","Formally Verified Convergence of Policy-Rich DBF Routing Protocols","16 pages + 9 pages of references and appendices",,,,"cs.NI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In this paper we present new general convergence results about the behaviour
of the Distributed Bellman-Ford (DBF) family of routing protocols, which
includes distance-vector protocols (e.g. RIP) and path-vector protocols (e.g.
BGP). Our results apply to ``policy-rich"" protocols, by which we mean protocols
that can have complex policies (e.g. conditional route transformations) that
violate traditional assumptions made in the standard presentation of
Bellman-Ford protocols.
  First, we propose a new algebraic model for abstract routing problems which
has fewer primitives than previous models and can represent more expressive
policy languages. The new model is also the first to allow concurrent reasoning
about distance-vector and path-vector protocols.
  Second, we demonstrate how DBF routing protocols are instances of a larger
class of asynchronous iterative algorithms, for which there already exist
powerful results about convergence. These results allow us to build upon
conditions previously shown by Sobrinho to be sufficient and necessary for the
convergence of path-vector protocols and strengthen them: we show that, with a
minor modification, they also apply to distance-vector protocols; we prove they
guarantee that the final routing solution reached is unique, thereby
eliminating the possibility of anomalies such as BGP wedgies; we relax the
model of asynchronous communication, showing that the results still hold if
routing messages can be lost, reordered, and duplicated.
  Thirdly, our model and our accompanying theoretical results have been fully
formalised in the Agda theorem prover. The resulting library is a powerful tool
for quickly prototyping and formally verifying new policy languages. As an
example, we formally verify the correctness of a policy language with many of
the features of BGP including communities, conditional policy, path-inflation
and route filtering.

cases, similarity ranking is an unsupervised problem as similarity labels are
unavailable. Moreover, an ideal model should not be restricted by documents'
length. Hence, we introduce SDR, a self-supervised method for document
similarity that can be applied to documents of arbitrary length. Importantly,
SDR can be effectively applied to extremely long documents, exceeding the 4,096
maximal token limits of Longformer. Extensive evaluations on large document
datasets show that SDR significantly outperforms its alternatives across all

evaluate the truthfulness of a claim. Existing approaches typically (i) explore

granularity levels but fail to capture their topical consistency during the
reasoning process, which we believe is crucial for verification; (ii) aggregate
multiple pieces of evidence equally without considering their implicit stances
to the claim, thereby introducing spurious information. To alleviate the above
issues, we propose a novel topic-aware evidence reasoning and stance-aware
aggregation model for more accurate fact verification, with the following four
key properties: 1) checking topical consistency between the claim and evidence;
2) maintaining topical coherence among multiple pieces of evidence; 3) ensuring
semantic similarity between the global topic information and the semantic

heat engines that deliver maximum power with Carnot efficiency in the one-shot
finite-size regime. These engines are composed of working systems with a finite
number of quantum particles and are restricted to one-shot measurements. The
engines operate in a one-step cycle by letting the working system
simultaneously interact with hot and cold baths via semi-local thermal
operations. By allowing quantum entanglement between its constituents and,
thereby, a coherent transfer of heat from hot to cold baths, the engine
implements the fastest possible reversible state transformation in each cycle,
resulting in maximum power and Carnot efficiency. Finally, we propose a
physically realizable engine using quantum optical systems.

floods during the South-West Monsoon of 2018. The season was marked by severely
anomalous rainfall trends, with upto 150 mm of departures from the mean daily
precipitation in the northern districts of the State. Although, there were many
studies about the hydrogeological factors which aggravated the floods in
Kerala, no attempt was made to delve into the physics which actually resulted
in anomalous precipitation during the year. This study intends to document the
dynamical phenomenon which caused the Kerala Floods of 2018. The westward
propagating convectively-coupled Mixed Rossby-Gravity (MRG) waves were excited
by the synoptic disturbances of the tropical Pacific at the pressure level of
700 hPa, during the Indian Monsoon of 2018. They travelled across the Indian
Ocean in two significant modes -- a predominant slow moving wave of 20-40 days
period (as Madden-Julian Oscillation) and a secondary faster wave of 5-8 days
period. They are characterised by vertical phase propagation to the upper
troposphere, a precursor to deep convection and intense precipitation. Further,
the propagation of these waves through a medium enhances its relative vorticity
and the gyres or circulations thus formed are symmetrical about the equator.
Consequently, the meanders in the wind field and widening of the Intertropical
Convergence Zone were observed. The MRG waves, especially the slow mode induced
divergence in the wind field, which fueled convection in tropics and brought
very heavy rainfall to the State of Kerala in 2018.

systems is the need to resolve, in addition to velocity space, at least one
physical dimension (e.g. along flux lines) to capture the relevant physics. In
general, this requires a kinetic treatment. Fully kinetic Particle-In-Cell
(PIC) simulations can be applied but at the expense of large computational
effort. A common way to resolve this is to use a hybrid approach: kinetic ions
and fluid electrons. In the present work, the development of a hybrid PIC
computational tool suitable for open magnetic geometries is described which
includes (1) the effect of non-uniform magnetic fields, (2) finite
fully-absorbing boundaries for the particles and (3) volumetric particle
sources. Analytical expressions for the momentum transport in the paraxial
limit are presented with their underlying assumptions and are used to validate
the results from the PIC simulations. The self-consistent electric field is
calculated and is shown to modify the ion velocity distribution function in
manner consistent with analytic theory. Based on this analysis, the ion
distribution function is understood in terms of a loss-cone distribution and an
isotropic Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution driven by a volumetric plasma source.

Background (CMB) and weak lensing (WL) surveys have uncovered a $\sim 3\sigma$
disagreement in the inferred value of the parameter $S_8 \equiv
\sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}$, quantifying the amplitude of late-time matter
fluctuations. Before questioning whether the $S_8$ discrepancy calls for new
physics, it is important to assess the view of measurements other than CMB and
WL ones on the discrepancy. Here, we examine the role of measurements of the
growth rate $f(z)$ in arbitrating the $S_8$ discrepancy, considering
measurements of $f\sigma_8(z)$ from Redshift-Space Distortions (RSD). Our
baseline analysis combines RSD measurements with geometrical measurements from
Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa), given the
key role of the latter in constraining $\Omega_m$. From this combination and
within the $\Lambda$CDM model we find $S_8 = 0.762^{+0.030}_{-0.025}$, and
quantify the agreement between RSD+BAO+SNeIa and \textit{Planck} to be at the
$2.2\sigma$ level: the mild disagreement is therefore compatible with a
statistical fluctuation. We discuss combinations of RSD measurements with other
datasets, including the $E_G$ statistic. This combination increases the
discrepancy with \textit{Planck}, but we deem it significantly less robust. Our
earlier results are stable against an extension where we allow the dark energy
equation of state $w$ to vary. We conclude that, from the point of view of
combined growth rate and geometrical measurements, there are hints, but no
strong evidence yet, for the \textit{Planck} $\Lambda$CDM cosmology
over-predicting the amplitude of matter fluctuations at redshifts $z \lesssim
1$. From this perspective, it might therefore still be premature to claim the
need for new physics from the $S_8$ discrepancy.

$\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model reduction, exploit the structure of linear
dynamical systems to produce models that accurately capture the dynamics. For
nonlinear systems operating far away from equilibria, on the other hand,
current approaches seek low-dimensional representations of the state that often
neglect low-energy features that have high dynamical significance. For
instance, low-energy features are known to play an important role in fluid
dynamics where they can be a driving mechanism for shear-layer instabilities.
Neglecting these features leads to models with poor predictive accuracy despite
being able to accurately encode and decode states. In order to improve
predictive accuracy, we propose to optimize the reduced-order model to fit a
collection of coarsely sampled trajectories from the original system. In
particular, we optimize over the product of two Grassmann manifolds defining
Petrov-Galerkin projections of the full-order governing equations. We compare
our approach with existing methods including proper orthogonal decomposition,
balanced truncation-based Petrov-Galerkin projection, quadratic-bilinear
balanced truncation, and the quadratic-bilinear iterative rational Krylov

paradigm defined by minimising a loss function. Both approaches are useful and,
if the loss can be re-cast into a proper probability model, there are many
tools to decide which model or loss is more appropriate for the observed data,
in the sense of explaining the data's nature. However, when the loss leads to
an improper model, there are no principled ways to guide this choice. We
address this task by combining the Hyv\""arinen score, which naturally targets
infinitesimal relative probabilities, and general Bayesian updating, which
provides a unifying framework for inference on losses and models. Specifically
we propose the H-score, a general Bayesian selection criterion and prove that
it consistently selects the (possibly improper) model closest to the
data-generating truth in Fisher's divergence. We also prove that an associated
H-posterior consistently learns optimal hyper-parameters featuring in loss
functions, including a challenging tempering parameter in generalised Bayesian
inference. As salient examples, we consider robust regression and
non-parametric density estimation where popular loss functions define improper
models for the data and hence cannot be dealt with using standard model
selection tools. These examples illustrate advantages in robustness-efficiency
trade-offs and provide a Bayesian implementation for kernel density estimation,
opening a new avenue for Bayesian non-parametrics.

visualization of the coherent phonon transport in a periodic MoS2/MoSe2 arrayed
heterostructure with minimum lattice mismatching using non-equilibrium
molecular dynamics simulation. It is found that the coherent phonon transport
can be destroyed and rebuilt through adjusting the density of MoSe2 nanodot
arrays. The phonon localization induced by the destruction of correlation is
visualized based on the spatial energy distribution and anharmonic analysis.
Furthermore, the eigen vector diagrams provide a distinct visualization of the
localized phonon modes. Besides, the correlation of phonon can be rebuilt by
reducing the period length, which is verified by the enhanced group velocities
extracted from phonon dispersion curves. Interestingly, the crossover from
incoherent to coherent phonon transport is directly observed by the spatial
energy distributions and the spectral phonon transmission coefficients.
Finally, the size and temperature dependence of thermal conductivity are also
discussed. This study of the phonon coherence and its visualizing manipulation
on thermal conductivity will be beneficial to fine heat control and management

Cartesian product operator (MLSC) is a long-standing open problem in computable
set theory. For long, it was not excluded that such a problem were undecidable,
due to its remarkable resemblance with the well-celebrated Hilbert's tenth
problem, as it was deemed reasonable that union of disjoint sets and Cartesian
product might somehow play the roles of integer addition and multiplication.
  To dispense with nonessential technical difficulties, we report here about a
positive solution to the satisfiability problem for a slight simplified variant
of MLSC, yet fully representative of the combinatorial complications due to the
presence of the Cartesian product, in which membership is not present and the
Cartesian product operator is replaced with its unordered variant.
  We are very confident that such decidability result can be generalized to
full MLSC, though at the cost of considerable technicalities.

  of Molecular Re-radiation",,,,,"eess.SP cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The operation of Terahertz (THz) communication can be significantly impacted
by the interaction between the transmitted wave and the molecules in the
atmosphere. In particular, it has been observed experimentally that the signal
undergoes not only molecular absorption, but also molecular re-radiation. Two
extreme modeling assumptions are prevalent in the literature, where the
re-radiated energy is modeled in the first as additive Gaussian noise and in
the second as a scattered component strongly correlated to the actual signal.
Since the exact characterization is still an open problem, we provide in this
paper the first comparative study of the performance of a reconfigurable
intelligent surface (RIS) assisted THz system under these two extreme models of
re-radiation. In particular, we employ an RIS to overcome the large pathloss by
creating a virtual line-of-sight (LOS) path. We then develop an optimization
framework for this setup and utilize the block-coordinate descent (BCD) method
to iteratively optimize both RIS configuration vector and receive beamforming
weight resulting in significant throughput gains for the user of interest
compared to random RIS configurations. As expected, our results reveal that
better throughput is achieved under the scattering assumption for the molecular
re-radiation than the noise assumption.

untranscribed/unlabeled speech data to improve automatic speech recognition

cases performs worse than the original system. In this paper, we address the
issue of low-resource ASR when only untranscribed out-of-domain speech data is
readily available in the target language. Specifically, we look to improve
performance on conversational/telephony speech (target domain) using web
resources, in particular YouTube data, which more closely resembles
news/topical broadcast data. Leveraging SST, we show that while in some cases
simply pooling the out-of-domain data with the training data lowers word error

out-of-domain data and then fine-tune the resulting model with the original
training data. Using 2000 hours of speed perturbed YouTube audio in each target
language, with semi-supervised transcripts, we show improvements on multiple
languages/data sets, of up to 16.3% relative improvement in WER over the
baseline systems and up to 7.4% relative improvement in WER over a system that
simply pools the out-of-domain data with the training data.

Previous work has shown that the optical and X-ray were characterised by
regular outbursts at the proposed binary period of 119 d. However around
February 2008 the optical behaviour changed substantially, with the previously
regular optical outbursts ending. Reported here are new optical (OGLE) and
X-ray (Swift) observations covering the period after 2008 which suggest an
almost total circumstellar disc loss followed by a gradual recovery. This
indicates the probable transition of a Be star to a B star, and back again.
However, at the time of the most recent OGLE data (March 2020) the
characteristic periodic outbursts had yet to return to their early state,
indicating that the disk still had some re-building yet to complete.

protostars of all masses. In the case of low-mass (<8 Msun) protostars, strong
observational evidence exists that the launching and collimation is due to the
X- and/or disk-wind mechanisms. In these models, it is the protostar/disk
system that creates all the necessary conditions to launch and collimate the
jets near the protostar via strong magnetic fields. The origin of jets from
more massive protostars has been investigated much less, in part because of the
difficulty of resolving the collimation zone in these more distant objects.
Here we present the highest angular resolution observations of a jet powered by
a massive protostar, the Cep A HW2 radio jet. We imaged the radio emission at
projected distances of only ~20 au from the protostar, resolving the innermost
100 au of a massive protostellar jet for the first time. The morphology of the
radio jet emission in this massive object is very different than what is
usually observed in jets from low-mass protostars. We found that the outflowing
material in HW2 has two components: a wide-angle wind launched from the
protostar/disk system, and a highly collimated jet starting at 20-30 au from
the protostar. We discuss two possible scenarios: an extension of the classical
disk-wind to a massive protostar, or external collimation of a wide-angle wind.
These results have important consequences for our understanding of how stars of
different masses are formed.

technologically important substrates such as GaAs necessitate layer transfer
and anneal steps, which introduce defects into the graphene. \textit{In-situ}
photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal that Mn diffusion through
graphene grown directly on a Ge (001) substrate is 1000 times lower than Mn
diffusion into samples without graphene ($D_{gr,direct} \sim
4\times10^{-18}$cm$^2$/s, $D_{no-gr} \sim 5 \times 10^{-15}$ cm$^2$/s at

a factor of 10 compared to no graphene ($D_{gr,transfer} \sim

low activation energy ($E_a \sim 0.1-0.5$ eV) suggests that Mn diffusion
through graphene occurs primarily at graphene defects. This is further
confirmed as the diffusivity prefactor, $D_0$, scales with the defect density
of the graphene sheet. Similar diffusion barrier performance is found on GaAs
substrates; however, it is not currently possible to grow graphene directly on

users' ability to store keys in easily-available but less secure storage

Unlike previous solutions, the user can restore Phoenix security after the
theft of tier-two keys and does not lose funds despite losing keys in either
tier. Phoenix also introduces a mechanism to reduce the damage an attacker can
cause in case of a tier-one compromise.

is highly sensitive and vulnerable to subtle bugs, we apply a formal

examine the critical behaviour of population of saddles with fixed instability
index $k$ in high dimensional random energy landscapes. Such landscapes consist
of a parabolic confining potential and a random part in $N\gg 1$ dimensions.
When the relative strength $m$ of the parabolic part is decreasing below a
critical value $m_c$, the random energy landscapes exhibit a glass-like
transition from a simple phase with very few critical points to a complex phase
with the energy surface having exponentially many critical points. We obtain
the annealed probability distribution of the instability index $k$ by working
out the mean size of the population of saddles with index $k$ relative to the
mean size of the entire population of critical points and observe toppling of
stability hierarchy which accompanies the underlying glass-like transition. In
the transition region $m=m_c + \delta N^{-1/2}$ the typical instability index
scales as $k = \kappa N^{1/4}$ and the toppling mechanism affects whole
instability index distribution, in particular the most probable value of
$\kappa$ changes from $\kappa = 0$ in the simple phase ($\delta > 0 $) to a
non-zero value $ \kappa_{\max} \propto (-\delta)^{3/2}$ in the complex phase
($\delta < 0$). We also show that a similar phenomenon is observed in random
landscapes with an additional fixed energy constraint and in the $p$-spin
spherical model.

fluctuations in the nuclear medium. In order to assess their impact on nuclear
bulk properties, like nuclear radii and kinetic energies, it is instrumental to
determine how SRCs are distributed in phase space as this sheds light on the
connection between their appearance in coordinate and momentum space. Using the
lowest-order correlation operator approximation (LCA) to include SRC, we
compute two-dimensional nuclear Wigner quasiprobability distributions $w(r, k)$
to locate those $({r}, {k})$ phase-space regions that are most heavily impacted
by SRCs. The SRC-induced high-momentum components find their origin in a radial
range that is confined to the nuclear interior. Significant SRCs strength is
generated in the full momentum range $0 \leq k \lesssim 5 ~\text{fm}^{-1} $
covered in this work, but below the Fermi momentum those are dwarfed by the
mean-field contributions. As an application of $w(r, k)$, we focus on the
radial dependence of the kinetic energy $T$ and the momentum dependence of the
radius $r_{\text{rms}}$ for the symmetric nuclei $^{12}$C, $^{40}$Ca and the
asymmetric nucleus $^{48}$Ca. The kinetic energy almost doubles after including
SRCs, with the largest increase occurring in the nuclear interior $r \lesssim
2$ fm. The momentum dependence of the $r_{\text{rms}}$ teaches that the largest
contributions stem from $k \lesssim 2 $ fm$^{-1}$, where the SRCs induce a
slight reduction of the order of a few percent. The SRCs systematically reduce

associated reverse-time SDE may be estimated using score-matching. A limitation
of this approach is that the forward-time SDE must be run for a sufficiently
long time for the final distribution to be approximately Gaussian. In contrast,
solving the Schr\""odinger Bridge problem (SB), i.e. an entropy-regularized

been proposed so far. In this article, we carried out a systematic study on the
He star donor channel, in which a neutron star (NS) accretes matter from a He
main-sequence star through Roche-lobe overflow, where the mass-transfer is
driven by gravitational wave radiation. Firstly, we followed the long-term
evolution of the NS+He main-sequence star binaries by employing the stellar
evolution code Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics, and thereby
obtained the initial parameter spaces for the production of UCXBs. We then used
these results to perform a detailed binary population synthesis approach to
obtain the Galactic rates of UCXBs through this channel. We estimate the
Galactic rates of UCXBs appearing as LISA sources to be $\sim3.1-11.9\, \rm
Myr^{-1}$ through this channel, and the number of such UCXB-LISA sources in the
Galaxy can reach about $1-26$ calibrated by observations. The present work
indicates that the He star donor channel may contribute significantly to the
Galactic UCXB formation rate. We found that the evolutionary tracks of UCXBs
through this channel can account for the location of the five transient sources
with relatively long orbital periods quite well. We also found that such UCXBs
can be identified by their locations in the mass-transfer rate versus the

Several diagnosis problems ranging from classification of lesions as being

addressed with deep learning based approaches.
  This thesis tackled two main problems regarding the diagnosis of prostate
cancer. Firstly, XmasNet was used to conduct two large experiments on the
classification of lesions. Secondly, detection and segmentation experiments
were conducted, first on the prostate and afterward on the prostate cancer
lesions. The former experiments explored the lesions through a two-dimensional
space, while the latter explored models to work with three-dimensional inputs.
For this task, the 3D models explored were the 3D U-Net and a pretrained 3D
ResNet-18. A rigorous analysis of all these problems was conducted with a total
of two networks, two cropping techniques, two resampling techniques, two crop
sizes, five input sizes and data augmentations experimented for lesion
classification. While for segmentation two models, two input sizes and data
augmentations were experimented. However, while the binary classification of
the clinical significance of lesions and the detection and segmentation of the
prostate already achieve the desired results (0.870 AUC and 0.915 dice score

lesions still have a large margin to improve (0.664 accuracy and 0.690 dice

concern as people may unknowingly bump into various obstacles that could lead
to severe injuries. In this paper, we propose ObstacleWatch, an acoustic-based
obstacle collision detection system to improve the safety of pedestrians who
are engaged in smartphone usage while walking. ObstacleWatch leverages the
advanced audio hardware of the smartphone to sense the surrounding obstacles
and infers fine-grained information about the frontal obstacle for collision
detection. In particular, our system emits well-designed inaudible beep signals
from the smartphone built-in speaker and listens to the reflections with the
stereo recording of the smartphone. By analyzing the reflected signals received
at two microphones, ObstacleWatch is able to extract fine-grained information
of the frontal obstacle including the distance, angle, and size for detecting
the possible collisions and to alert users. Our experimental evaluation under
two real-world environments with different types of phones and obstacles shows
that ObstacleWatch achieves over 92% accuracy in predicting obstacle collisions
with distance estimation errors at about 2 cm. Results also show that
ObstacleWatch is robust to different sizes of objects and is compatible with
different phone models with low energy consumption.

  Verification",,,,,"cs.CR cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Voice authentication is drawing increasing attention and becomes an
attractive alternative to passwords for mobile authentication. Recent advances
in mobile technology further accelerate the adoption of voice biometrics in an
array of diverse mobile applications. However, recent studies show that voice
authentication is vulnerable to replay attacks, where an adversary can spoof a
voice authentication system using a pre-recorded voice sample collected from
the victim. In this paper, we propose VoiceLive, a liveness detection system
for both text-dependent and text-independent voice authentication on
smartphones. VoiceLive detects a live user by leveraging the user's unique
vocal system and the stereo recording of smartphones. In particular, utilizing
the built-in gyroscope, loudspeaker, and microphone, VoiceLive first measures
the smartphone's distance and angle from the user, then it captures the
position-specific time-difference-of-arrival (TDoA) changes in a sequence of
phoneme sounds to the two microphones of the phone, and uses such unique TDoA
dynamic which doesn't exist under replay attacks for liveness detection.
VoiceLive is practical as it doesn't require additional hardware but
two-channel stereo recording that is supported by virtually all smartphones.
Our experimental evaluation with 12 participants and different types of phones
shows that VoiceLive achieves over 99% detection accuracy at around 1% Equal
Error Rate (EER) on the text-dependent system and around 99% accuracy and 2%
EER on the text-independent one. Results also show that VoiceLive is robust to
different phone positions, i.e. the user is free to hold the smartphone with
distinct distances and angles.

First, analogical reasoning (AR) is defined, and use-cases of AR in the
computing sciences are presented. The concept of schema is introduced, along
with use-cases in computing. Finally, recommendations are offered for future
work on using analogical reasoning and schema methods in the computing

to a large number of layers in deep networks, their training requires a long
time and a large number of datasets. Today is popular to use trained deep
neural networks for various tasks, even for simple ones in which such deep
networks are not required. The well-known deep networks such as YoloV3, SSD,
etc. are intended for tracking and monitoring various objects, therefore their
weights are heavy and the overall accuracy for a specific task is low.
Eye-tracking tasks need to detect only one object - an iris in a given area.
Therefore, it is logical to use a neural network only for this task. But the
problem is the lack of suitable datasets for training the model. In the
manuscript, we presented a dataset that is suitable for training custom models
of convolutional neural networks for eye-tracking tasks. Using data set data,
each user can independently pre-train the convolutional neural network models
for eye-tracking tasks. This dataset contains annotated 10,000 eye images in an
extension of 416 by 416 pixels. The table with annotation information shows the
coordinates and radius of the eye for each image. This manuscript can be
considered as a guide for the preparation of datasets for eye-tracking devices

  Wave Universe)","28 pages",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  A wave view of the universe is proposed in which each natural phenomenon is
equipped with its own unique natural viewing lens. A self-sameness modeling
principle and its systematic application in Fourier-Laplace transform space is
proposed as a novel, universal discrete modeling paradigm for
advection-diffusion-reaction equations (ADREs) across non-integer derivatives,
time scales, and wave spectral signatures. Its implementation is a novel exact
spectral derivative discretization finite difference method (ESDDFD), a way for
crafting wave viewing lenses by obtaining discrete wave models from ADRE
models. The template for building these lenses come in the form of natural
derivative representations obtained from the wave signature probability
distribution function and its harmonic oscillation in FL transform space; use
of the ESDDFD method in the discrete numerical modeling of wave equations
requires no a-priori theory of any mathematical derivative. A major
mathematical consequence of this viewpoint is that all notions of the
mathematical integer or non-integer derivatives have representation as limits
of such natural derivative representations; this and other consequences are
discussed and a discretization of a simple integer derivative
diffusion-reaction equation is presented to illustrate the method. The
resulting view lenses, in the form of ESDDFD models, work well in detecting
both local and non-local Debye or Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts exponential
patterns; only Brownian motion and sub-diffusion are discussed in the present
article.

one objective is often at the expense of another. The Pareto front reports the
optimal trade-offs between competing objectives. Here we report a self-driving
laboratory, ""Ada"", that defines the Pareto front of conductivities and
processing temperatures for palladium films formed by combustion synthesis. Ada
identified previously untested combustion synthesis conditions that resulted in
the discovery of lower processing temperatures (below 200 {\deg}C) relative to
the prior art for this technique (250 {\deg}C), a temperature difference that
makes the coating of different commodity plastic materials possible (e.g.,
Nafion, polyethersulfone). These conditions enabled us to use combustion
synthesis to spray coat uniform palladium films with moderate conductivity (1.1
$\times$ 10$^5$ S m$^{-1}$) at 191 {\deg}C. Spray coating at 226 {\deg}C
yielded films with conductivities (2.0 $\times$ 10$^6$ S m$^{-1}$) comparable
to those of sputtered films (2.0 to 5.8 $\times$ 10$^6$ S m$^{-1}$). This work
shows how self-driving laboratories can discover materials satisfying multiple
objectives.

molecular dynamics by multiple orders of magnitude and thus revolutionize
chemical simulations. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have recently shown great
successes for this task, overtaking classical methods based on fixed molecular
kernels. However, they still appear very limited from a theoretical
perspective, since regular GNNs cannot distinguish certain types of graphs. In
this work we close this gap between theory and practice. We show that GNNs with
directed edge embeddings and two-hop message passing are indeed universal
approximators for predictions that are invariant to translation, and
equivariant to permutation and rotation. We then leverage these insights and
multiple structural improvements to propose the geometric message passing
neural network (GemNet). We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed changes in
multiple ablation studies. GemNet outperforms previous models on the COLL,
MD17, and OC20 datasets by 34%, 41%, and 20%, respectively, and performs
especially well on the most challenging molecules. Our implementation is

techniques have shown the potential of data-driven approaches in a large number
of computing fields. Machine learning is increasingly included in computing
curricula in higher education, and a quickly growing number of initiatives are
expanding it in K-12 computing education, too. As machine learning enters K-12
computing education, understanding how intuition and agency in the context of
such systems is developed becomes a key research area. But as schools and
teachers are already struggling with integrating traditional computational
thinking and traditional artificial intelligence into school curricula,
understanding the challenges behind teaching machine learning in K-12 is an
even more daunting challenge for computing education research. Despite the
central position of machine learning in the field of modern computing, the
computing education research body of literature contains remarkably few studies
of how people learn to train, test, improve, and deploy machine learning
systems. This is especially true of the K-12 curriculum space. This article
charts the emerging trajectories in educational practice, theory, and
technology related to teaching machine learning in K-12 education. The article
situates the existing work in the context of computing education in general,
and describes some differences that K-12 computing educators should take into
account when facing this challenge. The article focuses on key aspects of the
paradigm shift that will be required in order to successfully integrate machine
learning into the broader K-12 computing curricula. A crucial step is
abandoning the belief that rule-based ""traditional"" programming is a central
aspect and building block in developing next generation computational thinking.
