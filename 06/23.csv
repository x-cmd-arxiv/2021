major focus of condensed matter physics for many decades. While many questions
remain unanswered, experiments have found that the systems with the highest
critical temperatures tend to be layered materials where superconductivity
occurs in two-dimensional (2D) structures. However, to what extent the
remarkable stability of these strongly correlated 2D superfluids is related to
their reduced dimensionality is still an open question. In this work, we use
dilute gases of ultracold fermionic atoms as a model system to directly observe
the influence of dimensionality on strongly interacting fermionic superfluids.
We achieve this by measuring the superfluid gap of a strongly correlated
quasi-2D Fermi gas over a wide range of interaction strengths and comparing the
results to recent measurements in 3D Fermi gases. We find that the superfluid
gap follows the same universal function of the interaction strength in both
systems, which suggests that there is no inherent difference in the stability
of fermionic superfluidity between two- and three-dimensional quantum gases.
Finally, we compare our data to results from solid state systems and find a
similar relation between the interaction strength and the gap for a wide range
of two- and three-dimensional superconductors.

relativity that were pursued by Peter Bergmann and Arthur Komar in the 1960's

group of canonical transformations, where the four-dimensional diffeomorphism
phase space transformations were factored out. Equivalence classes were
identified by a set of phase space functions that were invariant under the
action of the four-dimensional diffeomorphism group. This is contrasted and
compared with approaches of Paul Weiss, Julian Schwinger, Richard Arnowitt,
Stanley Deser, Charles Misner, Karel Kuchar - and especially the
geometrodynamical program of John Wheeler and Bryce DeWitt where diffeomorphism
symmetry is replaced by a notion of multifingered time. The origins of all of
these approaches are traced to Elie Cartan's invariant integral formulation of
classical dynamics. A related correspondence concerning the thin sandwich

This letter considers a new multi-IRS aided wireless network where a cascaded
line-of-sight (LoS) link is established between the base station (BS) and a
remote user by leveraging the multi-hop signal reflection of selected IRSs. As
compared to the conventional single-/double-hop IRS system, multi-hop IRS
system provides more pronounced path diversity and cooperative passive
beamforming gains, especially in the environment with dense obstacles. However,
a more challenging joint active/passive beamforming and multi-hop beam routing
problem also arises for maximizing the end-to-end channel gain. Furthermore,
the number of IRS-associated channel coefficients increases drastically with
the number of IRS hops. To tackle the above issues, in this letter we propose a
new and efficient beam training based solution by considering the use of
practical codebook-based BS/IRS active/passive beamforming without the need of
explicit channel estimation. Instead of exhaustively or sequentially searching
over all combinations of active and passive beam patterns for each beam route,
a distributed beam training scheme is proposed to reduce the complexity, by
exploiting the (nearly) time-invariant BS-IRS and inter-IRS channels and the
cooperative training among the BS and IRSs' controllers. Simulation results
show that our proposed design achieves the end-to-end channel gain close to
that of the sequential beam search, but at a much lower training overhead and
complexity.

improve the gradient estimates. The resulting algorithm is a novel type of

great concern, but recent evidence shows that a considerable amount of TD is
fixed by the same developers who introduced it; this is termed self-fixed TD.
This characteristic of TD management can potentially impact team dynamics and
practices in managing TD. However, the initial evidence is based on low-level
source code analysis; this casts some doubt whether practitioners repay their
own debt intentionally and under what circumstances. To address this gap, we
conducted an online survey on 17 well-known Java and Python open-source
software communities to investigate practitioners' intent and rationale for
self-fixing technical debt. We also investigate the relationship between
human-related factors (e.g., experience) and self-fixing. The results, derived
from the responses of 181 participants, show that a majority addresses their
own debt consciously and often. Moreover, those with a higher level of
involvement (e.g., more experience in the project and number of contributions)
tend to be more concerned about self-fixing TD. We also learned that the sense
of responsibility is a common self-fixing driver and that decisions to fix TD
are not superficial but consider balancing costs and benefits, among other
factors. The findings in this paper can lead to improving TD prevention and
management strategies.

from an existing labeled domain to a new domain. However, existing
disentanglement-based methods do not fully consider separation between

sufficiently used during training. In this paper, we propose a novel enhanced
separable disentanglement (ESD) model. We first employ a disentangler to
distill domain-invariant and domain-specific features. Then, we apply feature
separation enhancement processes to minimize contamination between

complete feature vectors, which are used for further disentanglement during the

Residual Networks (ResNets) for a joint registration and comparison. Our
ResNets handle better large protein deformations while being more
computationally efficient. On top of the mathematical framework, we further
design a Geometric Variational Auto-Encoder (G-VAE), that once trained, maps
original, previously unseen structures, into a low-dimensional (latent)
hyper-sphere. Motivated by the spherical structure of the pre-shape space, we
naturally adopt the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution to model our hidden

  The introduction of a novel realization of $0$-th Kashiwara operators reveals
that the skew RSK dynamics possesses symmetries induced by an affine bicrystal

its linearization.
  Studying asymptotic evolution of the dynamics started from a pair of skew

MM size and strong MM-photon coupling are expected to enhance their production.
Pb-Pb heavy-ion collisions at the LHC produce the strongest known magnetic

disrupt the performance of feature selection and estimation procedures for

mean-shift and variance-inflation outliers, which can be modeled as additional
fixed and random components, respectively, and evaluated independently. Our
proposal performs feature selection while detecting and down-weighting
variance-inflation outliers, detecting and excluding mean-shift outliers, and
retaining non-outlying cases with full weights. Feature selection and
mean-shift outlier detection are performed through a robust class of nonconcave
penalization methods. Variance-inflation outlier detection is based on the
penalization of the restricted posterior mode. The resulting approach satisfies
a robust oracle property for feature selection in the presence of data
contamination -- which allows the number of features to exponentially increase
with the sample size -- and detects truly outlying cases of each type with
asymptotic probability one. This provides an optimal trade-off between a high
breakdown point and efficiency. Computationally efficient heuristic procedures
are also presented. We illustrate the finite-sample performance of our proposal
through an extensive simulation study and a real-world application.

descent, and its variants enjoy near-optimal regret bounds and convergence
rates, but suffer from a computational bottleneck of computing ``projections''
in potentially each iteration (e.g., $O(T^{1/2})$ regret of online mirror
descent). On the other hand, conditional gradient variants solve a linear
optimization in each iteration, but result in suboptimal rates (e.g.,
$O(T^{3/4})$ regret of online Frank-Wolfe). Motivated by this trade-off in
runtime v/s convergence rates, we consider iterative projections of close-by
points over widely-prevalent submodular base polytopes $B(f)$. We first give
necessary and sufficient conditions for when two close points project to the
same face of a polytope, and then show that points far away from the polytope
project onto its vertices with high probability. We next use this theory and
develop a toolkit to speed up the computation of iterative projections over
submodular polytopes using both discrete and continuous perspectives. We
subsequently adapt the away-step Frank-Wolfe algorithm to use this information
and enable early termination. For the special case of cardinality-based
submodular polytopes, we improve the runtime of computing certain Bregman
projections by a factor of $\Omega(n/\log(n))$. Our theoretical results show
orders of magnitude reduction in runtime in preliminary computational

representations, have enabled human shape reconstruction and controllable
avatar generation from different sensor inputs. However, to generate realistic
cloth deformations from novel input poses, watertight meshes or dense full-body
scans are usually needed as inputs. Furthermore, due to the difficulty of
effectively modeling pose-dependent cloth deformations for diverse body shapes
and cloth types, existing approaches resort to per-subject/cloth-type
optimization from scratch, which is computationally expensive. In contrast, we
propose an approach that can quickly generate realistic clothed human avatars,
represented as controllable neural SDFs, given only monocular depth images. We
achieve this by using meta-learning to learn an initialization of a
hypernetwork that predicts the parameters of neural SDFs. The hypernetwork is
conditioned on human poses and represents a clothed neural avatar that deforms
non-rigidly according to the input poses. Meanwhile, it is meta-learned to
effectively incorporate priors of diverse body shapes and cloth types and thus
can be much faster to fine-tune, compared to models trained from scratch. We
qualitatively and quantitatively show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches that require complete meshes as inputs while our
approach requires only depth frames as inputs and runs orders of magnitudes
faster. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our meta-learned hypernetwork is very
robust, being the first to generate avatars with realistic dynamic cloth
deformations given as few as 8 monocular depth frames.

superconducting qubits coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide can behave as

decohering, a phenomenon that is not possible with small atoms. Here, we show
that this decoherence-free interaction is also possible when the coupling to
the waveguide is chiral, i.e., when the coupling depends on the propagation
direction of the light. Furthermore, we derive conditions under which the giant
atoms in such chiral architectures exhibit dark states. In particular, we show
that unlike small atoms, giant atoms in a chiral waveguide can reach a dark
state even without being excited by a coherent drive. We also show that in the
driven-dissipative regime, dark states can be populated faster in giant atoms.
The results presented here lay a foundation for applications based on giant

the imaginary part of the celestial amplitude. In particular, on the real axis
in the complex plane of the boost weight, the imaginary part of the celestial

which are nothing but the projection of flat-space spinning polynomials onto
the celestial sphere. Furthermore, we derive the celestial dispersion relation,

negative even integer boost weight. The latter is precisely the projection of
low energy EFT coefficients onto the celestial sphere. We demonstrate these
properties explicitly on the open and closed string celestial amplitudes.
Finally, we give an explicit expansion of the Poincar\'e partial waves in terms

range of novel architectures and reports competitive results on various
datasets. However, the proposed models are usually not properly compared to
each other and existing works often use different benchmarks and experiment
protocols. As a result, it is unclear for both researchers and practitioners
what models perform best. Additionally, the field still lacks effective
baselines, that is, the easy-to-use models that provide competitive performance
across different problems.
  In this work, we perform an overview of the main families of DL architectures
for tabular data and raise the bar of baselines in tabular DL by identifying
two simple and powerful deep architectures. The first one is a ResNet-like
architecture which turns out to be a strong baseline that is often missing in
prior works. The second model is our simple adaptation of the Transformer
architecture for tabular data, which outperforms other solutions on most tasks.
Both models are compared to many existing architectures on a diverse set of
tasks under the same training and tuning protocols. We also compare the best DL
models with Gradient Boosted Decision Trees and conclude that there is still no
universally superior solution.

metamaterials offer new opportunities to enhance the light-matter interaction,
boosting the influence of subtle effects on the optical response. The
combination of photonic metamaterials and superconducting quantum circuits will
have the potential to advance quantum computing and quantum communication
technologies. Here, we introduce subwavelength photonic nano-grating circuit
arrays on the facet of niobium thin films to enhance light-matter interaction
at fiber optic communication frequencies. We find that optical resonance shifts
to longer wavelengths with increasing nano-grating circuit periodicity,
indicating a clear modulation of optical light with geometrical parameters of
the device. Next to the prominent subwavelength resonance, we find a second

development of quantum-classical hybrid algorithms to resolve electronic

computation of molecular electronic structure. Such hybrid algorithms treat the
exponentially scaling part of the calculation -- the static (multireference)
correlation -- on the quantum computer and the non-exponentially scaling part
-- the dynamic correlation -- on the classical computer. While a variety of
such algorithms have been proposed, due to the dependence on the wave function
of most classical methods for dynamic correlation, the development of
easy-to-use classical post-processing implementations has been limited. Here we
present a novel hybrid-classical algorithm that computes a molecule's
all-electron energy and properties on the classical computer from a critically
important simulation of the static correlation on the quantum computer.
Significantly, for the all-electron calculations we circumvent the wave
function by using density-matrix methods that only require input of the
statically correlated two-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM), which can be
efficiently measured in the quantum simulation. Although the algorithm is
completely general, we test it with two classical 2-RDM methods, the
anti-Hermitian contracted Schr\""odinger equation (ACSE) theory and
multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT), using the recently
developed quantum ACSE method for the simulation of the statically correlated
2-RDM. We obtain experimental accuracy for the relative energies of all three

for each of these variables, we evaluate how well our fitting method can
recover these physical parameters for the given set of molecular lines. We then

baryon asymmetry is produced without violating baryon number at the Lagrangian
level. In this scenario, baryon asymmetry is generated by absorption of a new
particle X carrying baryon number onto Primordial Black Holes (PBHs). Assuming
CP-violation, the particle X is absorbed at a different rate than the
antiparticle $\bar{X}$, producing an asymmetry in the baryonic number. We
independently test this scenario, finding that it suffers from two fundamental
issues.\\ At the phenomenological level, strong absorption by PBHs initially
increases the baryon asymmetry. However, at later times such asymmetry is
completely absorbed by PBHs. In order to overcome this issue, we account for
PBH evaporation, which provides a natural way of halting the absorption while
keeping a finite baryon asymmetry. We provide a systematic study of the
parameter space, identifying the regions leading to the production of the
baryon asymmetry without violating the known constraints on PBHs concentration.
  At the theoretical level, a model realizing the CP-violation postulated in

down to redshift $z=4.4$. The simulated galaxy has properties consistent with
extrapolations of the main sequence of star-forming galaxies to higher
redshifts and levels off to a star formation rate of $\sim$60$\,
M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$ at $z=4.4$. A compact, thin rotating stellar disk with
properties analogous to those of low-redshift systems arises already at $z \sim
8$. The galaxy rapidly develops a multi-component structure, and the disk, at
least at these early stages, does not grow ""upside-down"" as often reported in
the literature. Rather, at any given time, newly born stars contribute to
sustain a thin disk. The kinematics reflect the early, ubiquitous presence of a
thin disk, as a stellar disk component with $v_\phi/\sigma_R$ larger than unity
is already present at $z \sim 9$--10. Our results suggest that high-resolution
spectro-photometric observations of very high-redshift galaxies should find
thin rotating disks, consistent with the recent discovery of cold rotating gas
disks by ALMA. Finally, we present synthetic images for the JWST NIRCam camera,
showing how the early disk would be easily detectable already at those early

by this, we study the rhombohedral honeycomb cobaltates CoTiO$_3$,
BaCo$_2$(PO$_4$)$_2$, and BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$, using $\textit{ab initio}$
density functional theory, which takes into account realistic crystal field

Hamiltonians including longer-range and anisotropic exchange couplings. For
CoTiO$_3$, we find a nearest-neighbor easy-plane ferromagnetic $XXZ$ model with
additional bond-dependent anisotropies and interlayer exchange, which supports
three-dimensional (3D) Dirac nodal line magnons. In contrast, for
BaCo$_2$(PO$_4$)$_2$ and BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$, we find a strongly suppressed
interlayer coupling, and significant frustration from additional third-neighbor
antiferromagnetic exchange mediated by P/As. Such bond-anisotropic $J_1$-$J_3$
spin models can support collinear zig-zag or coplanar spiral ground states; we
discuss their dynamical spin correlations which reveal a gapped Goldstone mode,
and argue that the effective parameters of these pseudospin-$1/2$ models may be
strongly renormalized by coupling to a low energy spin-exciton. Our results

consequence of the fermionic nature of the Cooper pairs. For spin-$1/2$ systems
this leads to the $\mathcal{SPOT}=-1$ classification of superconductivity,
where $\mathcal{S}$, $\mathcal{P}$, $\mathcal{O}$, and $\mathcal{T}$ refer to
the exchange operators for spin, parity, orbital, and time between the paired
electrons. However, this classification no longer holds for higher spin
fermions, where each electron also possesses a finite orbital angular momentum
strongly coupled with the spin degree of freedom, giving instead a conserved
total angular moment. For such systems, we here instead introduce the
$\mathcal{JPT}=-1$ classification, where $\mathcal{J}$ is the exchange operator
for the $z$-component of the total angular momentum quantum numbers. We then
specifically focus on spin-$3/2$ fermion systems and several superconducting
cubic half-Heusler compounds that have recently been proposed to be spin-$3/2$
superconductors. By using a generic Hamiltonian suitable for these compounds we
calculate the superconducting pair amplitudes and find finite pair amplitudes
for all possible symmetries obeying the $\mathcal{JPT}=-1$ classification,
including all possible odd-frequency (odd-$\omega$) combinations. Moreover, one
of the very interesting properties of spin-$3/2$ superconductors is the
possibility of them hosting a Bogoliubov Fermi surface (BFS), where the
superconducting energy gap is closed across a finite area. We show that a
spin-$3/2$ superconductor with a pair potential satisfying an odd-gap
time-reversal product and being non-commuting with the normal-state Hamiltonian
hosts both a BFS and has finite odd-$\omega$ pair amplitudes. We then reduce
the full spin-$3/2$ Hamiltonian to an effective two-band model and show that

the dynamics of ""wee partons"" in Regge asymptotics is controlled by emergent
semi-hard scales that lead to perturbative unitarization and classicalization
of $2\rightarrow N$ particle amplitudes at weak coupling. In particular, they
attain a maximal entropy permitted by unitarity, bounded by the inverse
coupling $\alpha$ of the respective constituents. Strikingly, this entropy is
equal to the area measured in units of the Goldstone constant corresponding to
the spontaneous breaking of Poincar{\'{e}} symmetry by the corresponding
graviton or gluon condensate. In gravity, the Goldstone constant is the Planck
scale, and gives rise to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Likewise, in the CGC,
the corresponding Goldstone scale is determined by the onset of gluon
screening. We point to further similarities in Black Hole formation,
thermalization and decay, to that of the Glasma matter formed from colliding

these data to the radio and X-ray observations, we cannot reconcile the
broad-band behavior with strong AGN activity and instead attribute the dominant
source of persistent radio emission to star formation, likely originating from
the circumnuclear region of the host. The modeling also indicates a hot dust

many MD trajectories, with a description close to the state-of-art

(QSGW+f$_{xc}$). Thus, we explore water spectral properties when different MD
approaches are used, ranging from classical MD to first-principles MD, and
including nuclear quantum effects. We have observed that the different MD
approaches lead to up to 1 eV change in the average band gap, thus, we focused
on the band gap dependence with the geometrical properties of the system to
explain such spread. We have evaluated the changes in the band gap due to
variations in the intramolecular O-H bond distance, and HOH angle, as well as
the intermolecular hydrogen bond O$\cdot\cdot\cdot$O distance, and the OHO
angles. We have observed that the dominant contribution comes from the O-H bond
length; the O$\cdot\cdot\cdot$O distance plays a secondary role, and the other
geometrical properties do not significantly influence the gap. Furthermore, we
analyze the electronic density of states (DOS), where the KIPZ functional shows
a good agreement with the DOS obtained with state-of-art approaches employing
quasi-particle self-consistent GW plus vertex corrections. The O-H bond length
also significantly influences the DOS. When nuclear quantum effects are
considered, a broadening of the peaks driven by the broader distribution of the
O-H bond lengths is observed, leading to a closer agreement with the
experimental photoemission spectra.

exploited through a marginal least squares analysis for each variable, as in a

transformation problem, facilitating theoretical analysis and comparison to
other work. In contrast to regularized regression such as the lasso and its
extensions, neither adjustment for selection nor rescaling of the explanatory

discovery of recycling flows between the planetary envelope and the disc that
can slow or stall envelope accretion. We carry out 3D radiation hydrodynamic
simulations with an updated opacity compilation to model the proto-Jupiter's
envelope. To isolate the 3D effects of convection and recycling, we simulate
both isolated spherical envelopes and envelopes embedded in discs. The
envelopes are heated at given rates to achieve steady states, enabling
comparisons with 1D models. We vary envelope properties to obtain both
radiative and convective solutions. Using a passive scalar, we observe
significant mass recycling on the orbital timescale. For a radiative envelope,
recycling can only penetrate from the disc surface until $\sim$0.1-0.2
planetary Hill radii, while for a convective envelope, the convective motion
can ""dredge up"" the deeper part of the envelope so that the entire convective
envelope is recycled efficiently. This recycling, however, has only limited
effects on the envelopes' thermal structure. The radiative envelope embedded in
the disc has identical structure as the isolated envelope. The convective
envelope has a slightly higher density when it is embedded in the disc. We
introduce a modified 1D approach which can fully reproduce our 3D simulations.
With our updated opacity and 1D model, we recompute Jupiter's envelope
accretion with a 10 $M_{\oplus}$ core, and the timescale to runaway accretion
is shorter than the disc lifetime as in prior studies. Finally, we discuss the
implications of the efficient recycling on the observed chemical abundances of
the planetary atmosphere (especially for super-Earths and mini-Neptunes).

resonance frequency and pressure amplitudes of up to 1500 kPa, an excitation
regime used in many focused ultrasound applications. The bubble dynamics are
simulated using the Rayleigh-Plesset equation and the Gilmore equation, in
conjunction with the Marmottant model for the lipid monolayer coating. Also, a
new continuously differentiable variant of the Marmottant model is introduced.
Below the onset of inertial cavitation, a linear regime is identified in which
the maximum pressure at the bubble wall is linearly proportional to the
excitation pressure amplitude and, likewise, the mechanical index. This linear
regime is bounded by the Blake pressure and, in line with recent in vitro
experiments, the onset of inertial cavitation is found to occur approximately
at an excitation pressure amplitude of 130-190 kPa, dependent on the initial
bubble size. In the nonlinear regime the maximum pressure at the bubble wall is
found to be readily predicted by the maximum bubble radius and both the
Rayleigh-Plesset and Gilmore equations are shown to predict the onset of sub-
and ultraharmonic frequencies of the acoustic emissions compared to in vitro
experiments. Neither the surface dilatational viscosity of the lipid monolayer
nor the compressibility of the liquid have a discernible influence on the
studied quantities, yet accounting for the lipid coating is critical for the
accurate prediction of the bubble behaviour. The Gilmore equation is shown to
be valid for the considered bubbles and excitation regime, and the
Rayleigh-Plesset equation also provides accurate qualitative predictions, even
though it is outside its range of validity for many of the considered cases.

The expanding motion of the clouds with $\Delta V \sim$6 km s$^{-1}$ was formed

heterogeneities. Their homogenization or upscaling requires cell problems that
are formulated in space-time representative volumes for problems with scale
separation. In problems without scale separation, local problems include
multiple macroscopic variables and oversampled local problems, where these
macroscopic parameters are computed. These approaches, called Non-local
multi-continua, are proposed for problems with complex spatial heterogeneities
in a number of previous papers. In this paper, we extend this approach for
space-time heterogeneities, by identifying macroscopic parameters in space-time
regions. Our proposed method space-time Non-local multi-continua (space-time
NLMC) is an efficient numerical solver to deal with time-dependent
heterogeneous coefficients. It provides a flexible and systematic way to
construct multiscale basis functions to approximate the solution. These
multiscale basis functions are constructed by solving a local energy
minimization problems in the oversampled space-time regions such that these
multiscale basis functions decay exponentially outside the oversampled domain.
Unlike the classical time-stepping methods combined with full-discretization
technique, our space-time NLMC efficiently constructs the multiscale basis
functions in a space-time domain and can provide a computational savings
compared to space-only approaches as we discuss in the paper. We present two

state-of-the-art of various vision tasks. One of the most challenging problems
in the vision transformer is that the large sequence length of image tokens
leads to high computational cost (quadratic complexity). A popular solution to
this problem is to use a single pooling operation to reduce the sequence
length. This paper considers how to improve existing vision transformers, where
the pooled feature extracted by a single pooling operation seems less powerful.
To this end, we note that pyramid pooling has been demonstrated to be effective
in various vision tasks owing to its powerful ability in context abstraction.
However, pyramid pooling has not been explored in backbone network design. To
bridge this gap, we propose to adapt pyramid pooling to Multi-Head
Self-Attention (MHSA) in the vision transformer, simultaneously reducing the
sequence length and capturing powerful contextual features. Plugged with our
pooling-based MHSA, we build a universal vision transformer backbone, dubbed
Pyramid Pooling Transformer (P2T). Extensive experiments demonstrate that, when
applied P2T as the backbone network, it shows substantial superiority in
various vision tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation,

each agent's pre-trained model without relying on external validation, model
retraining, or data pooling. Our approach takes inspiration from the literature
in social science on human consensus-making. We analyze our mechanism
theoretically, showing that it converges to inverse meansquared-error (MSE)
weighting in the large-sample limit. To compute error bars on the collective
predictions we propose a decentralized Jackknife procedure that evaluates the
sensitivity of our mechanism to a single agent's prediction. Empirically, we
demonstrate that our scheme effectively combines models with differing quality
across the input space. The proposed consensus prediction achieves significant
gains over classical model averaging, and even outperforms weighted averaging
schemes that have access to additional validation data.

field pulsar (PSR) J1119-6127 and its compact pulsar wind nebula (PWN) taken in
October 2019, three years after the source went into outburst. The 0.5-7 keV
post-outburst (2019) spectrum of the pulsar is best described by a
two-component blackbody plus powerlaw model with a temperature of 0.2\pm0.1
keV, photon index of 1.8\pm0.4 and X-ray luminosity of ~1.9e33 erg s^{-1},
consistent with its pre-burst quiescent phase. We find that the pulsar has gone
back to quiescence. The compact nebula shows a jet-like morphology elongated in
the north-south direction, similar to the pre-burst phase. The post-outburst
PWN spectrum is best fit by an absorbed powerlaw with a photon index of
2.3\pm0.5 and flux of ~3.2e-14 erg cm^{-2} s^{-1} (0.5-7 keV). The PWN spectrum
shows evidence of spectral softening in the post-outburst phase, with the
pre-burst photon index of 1.2\pm0.4 changing to 2.3\pm0.5, and pre-burst
luminosity of ~1.5e32 erg s^{-1} changing to 2.7e32 erg s^{-1} in the 0.5-7 keV
band, suggesting magnetar outbursts can impact PWNe. The observed timescale for
returning to quiescence, of just a few years, implies a rather fast cooling
process and favors a scenario where J1119 is temporarily powered by magnetic
energy following the magnetar outburst, in addition to its spin-down energy.

two constraints are shown to lead to the same equations governing the

conservative (when viscosity is set to zero), they exhibit flutter and
divergence instability. In addition, the Ziegler's destabilization paradox is
found when dissipation sources are introduced. It follows that these features
are proven to be not only a consequence of 'unrealistic non-conservative loads'

Deep Neural Networks(DNNs) against adversarial attacks. Most prior works use
neural network-based detectors or complex statistical analysis for adversarial
detection. These approaches are computationally intensive and vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. To this end, we propose DetectX - a hardware friendly
adversarial detection mechanism using hardware signatures like Sum of column
Currents (SoI) in memristive crossbars (XBar). We show that adversarial inputs
have higher SoI compared to clean inputs. However, the difference is too small
for reliable adversarial detection. Hence, we propose a dual-phase training
methodology: Phase1 training is geared towards increasing the separation
between clean and adversarial SoIs; Phase2 training improves the overall
robustness against different strengths of adversarial attacks. For
hardware-based adversarial detection, we implement the DetectX module using
32nm CMOS circuits and integrate it with a Neurosim-like analog crossbar
architecture. We perform hardware evaluation of the Neurosim+DetectX system on
the Neurosim platform using datasets-CIFAR10(VGG8), CIFAR100(VGG16) and
TinyImagenet(ResNet18). Our experiments show that DetectX is 10x-25x more
energy efficient and immune to dynamic adversarial attacks compared to previous
state-of-the-art works. Moreover, we achieve high detection performance
(ROC-AUC > 0.95) for strong white-box and black-box attacks. The code has been

algorithms for learning good policies for Multi-action RMABs online using
combinations of Lagrangian relaxation and Q-learning. Our first approach,
MAIQL, extends a method for Q-learning the Whittle index in binary-action RMABs
to the multi-action setting. We derive a generalized update rule and
convergence proof and establish that, under standard assumptions, MAIQL
converges to the asymptotically optimal multi-action RMAB policy as
$t\rightarrow{}\infty$. However, MAIQL relies on learning Q-functions and
indexes on two timescales which leads to slow convergence and requires problem
structure to perform well. Thus, we design a second algorithm, LPQL, which
learns the well-performing and more general Lagrange policy for multi-action
RMABs by learning to minimize the Lagrange bound through a variant of
Q-learning. To ensure fast convergence, we take an approximation strategy that
enables learning on a single timescale, then give a guarantee relating the
approximation's precision to an upper bound of LPQL's return as

labels to regions under alternative formulations. Further, we show that NGSP
maintains strong performance even with limited labeled data or noisy input

mimics important brain functions by operating over high-dimensional vectors,

desirable since they can significantly reduce data transfer overheads. All
existing in-memory HDC platforms consider binary HVs where each dimension is

liquidity allocated. This induces the problem of strategic liquidity provision:
smaller intervals result in higher concentration of liquidity and
correspondingly larger rewards when the price remains in the interval, but with
higher risk. We formalize this problem and study three classes of strategies
for liquidity providers: uniform, proportional, and optimal (via a constrained

in the {sub-TeV range} by the {MAGIC Cherenkov} telescope. The simultaneous
observations in X-ray range, which is presumed to be of synchrotron origin, and
in sub-TeV range, where the emission is presumed to be inverse Compton, provide
new stringent constraints on the conditions within the emitting regions {and
their evolution in time}. While the additional data contain a lot of new
information, it turns out that fitting both the X-ray and the TeV emission, is
much more complicated than what was originally anticipated. We find that
optical flux measurements provide important complementary information that in
combination with TeV measurements breaks degeneracy in the parameter space. We
present here a numerical fit to the multi-wavelength observed spectrum using a
new code that calculates the single-zone synchrotron including self-Compton
emission taking into account the exact Klein-Nishina cross-sections as well as
pair production via absorption of the high-energy photons inside the emitting
zone and the emission from the resulting secondary pairs. We also present a
revised set of single zone parameters and a method for fitting the data to the
observations. Our model for GRB~190114C that fits all the observations, from
the optical data point to the sub-TeV range, suggests that it is in the fast
cooling regime. The inferred parameters for observations {at two separate

success in synthesizing novel views of a scene from a sparse set of input
images. So far, the geometry learned by neural volume rendering techniques was
modeled using a generic density function. Furthermore, the geometry itself was
extracted using an arbitrary level set of the density function leading to a
noisy, often low fidelity reconstruction. The goal of this paper is to improve
geometry representation and reconstruction in neural volume rendering. We
achieve that by modeling the volume density as a function of the geometry. This
is in contrast to previous work modeling the geometry as a function of the
volume density. In more detail, we define the volume density function as
Laplace's cumulative distribution function (CDF) applied to a signed distance
function (SDF) representation. This simple density representation has three
benefits: (i) it provides a useful inductive bias to the geometry learned in
the neural volume rendering process; (ii) it facilitates a bound on the opacity
approximation error, leading to an accurate sampling of the viewing ray.
Accurate sampling is important to provide a precise coupling of geometry and
radiance; and (iii) it allows efficient unsupervised disentanglement of shape
and appearance in volume rendering. Applying this new density representation to
challenging scene multiview datasets produced high quality geometry
reconstructions, outperforming relevant baselines. Furthermore, switching shape
and appearance between scenes is possible due to the disentanglement of the
two.

is crucial to locate a black hole locally. This is usually done utilizing an
apparent horizon. An alternative proposal is to identify a geometric horizon
(GH), which is characterized by a surface in the spacetime on which the
curvature tensor or its covariant derivatives are algebraically special. This
necessitates the choice of a special null frame, which we shall refer to as an
algebraically preferred null frame (APNF). The GH is then identified by
surfaces of vanishing scalar curvature invariants but, unfortunately, these are
difficult to compute. However, the algebraic nature of a GH means that the APNF
plays a central role and suggests a null frame approach to characterizing the
GH. Indeed, if we employ the Cartan-Karlhede algorithm to completely fix the
null frame invariantly, then all of the remaining non vanishing components of
the curvature tensor and its covariant derivatives are Cartan scalars. Hence
the GH is characterized by the vanishing of certain Cartan scalars.
  A null frame approach is useful in the numerical investigation of the merger
of two black holes in general, but we will focus on the application to
identifying a GH. We begin with a review of the use of APNF and GH in previous
work. The APNF is then defined and chosen so that the Weyl tensor is
algebraically special, and we must examine the covariant derivatives of the
Weyl tensor in this frame. We show how to invariantly fix the null frame, and
hence characterize the APNF, and describe how to then identify the GH using the
zero-set of certain Cartan scalars. Our ultimate aim is to apply this frame
formalism to the numerical collapse of two black holes. As an example, we
investigate the axisymmetric evolution of a two black hole Kastor-Traschen
spacetime.

for head overcoat (HOC) thickness measurements in the magnetic hard disk drive

a decoder architecture, which is one of the most commonly used architectures in

outperform the standard top-K acquisition with virtually no computational

electronics applications, the origin and microscopic properties of the 2DEL

compounded by the variable presence of oxygen vacancies and coexistence of both

decisive tests of intrinsic electronic and orbital reconstruction at this

extract the depth dependence of both the orbital and electronic reconstructions

diffeomorphic to $O(k)\times [0,\infty)\times \mathbb{R}^k$, where the factor

embedded in $\mathbb{R}^k$ and isotopic to the identity, there is a dense
family of spheres, for which the subset of $\text{Sim}(\Delta)$ of simplices
inscribed in each embedded sphere contains a similar simplex of every pose

configuration space of $k+1$ distinct points on an embedded sphere is a
manifold whose top homology class maps to the top class in $O(k)$ via the pose

referred to as the reproduction or $R$ number, is a vital summary statistic for
understanding and managing epidemic diseases. There are many methods for
estimating $R$; however, few explicitly model heterogeneous disease
reproduction, which gives rise to superspreading within the population. We
propose a parsimonious discrete-time branching process model for epidemic
curves that incorporates heterogeneous individual reproduction numbers. Our
Bayesian approach to inference illustrates that this heterogeneity results in
less certainty on estimates of the time-varying cohort reproduction number
$R_t$. We apply these methods to a COVID-19 epidemic curve for the Republic of
Ireland and find support for heterogeneous disease reproduction. Our analysis
allows us to estimate the expected proportion of secondary infections
attributable to the most infectious proportion of the population. For example,
we estimate that the 20% most infectious index cases account for approximately
75-98% of the expected secondary infections with 95% posterior probability. In
addition, we highlight that heterogeneity is a vital consideration when
estimating $R_t$.

solutions of the step-index fiber (in the exponential basis), we discover that
the polarization-induced field component is a modified scalar OAM field (as
opposed to a standard OAM scalar field) with a shifted intensity pattern in the
weakly guiding approximation (WGA); the familiar intensity donut pattern is
reduced or increased in radius depending upon whether it is a case of
spin-alignment or anti-alignment with the OAM. Such a shift in the intensity
pattern appears to be a general feature of the field of a multilayered fiber as
seen from an extension to the ring-core fiber. Additionally, we derive a

separate classification from detection performance. Furthermore, we present a

transformed versions of the original classification task. Fitted ensembles can
naturally detect OOD examples without requiring auxiliary data by observing
contradicting predictions among its components. Experiments on MNIST, SVHN,

In the first categorization, we investigate how the generic features of sheaths
change with their potential formation mechanisms (propagation and expansion
sheaths), namely, their associations with magnetic ejectas (MEs) which are
primarily expanding or propagating in the solar wind. We find propagation
sheaths to be denser and driven by stronger MEs, whereas expansion sheaths are
faster. Exploring the temporal profiles of these sheaths with a superposed
epoch technique, we observe that most of the magnetic field and plasma
signatures are more elevated in propagation sheaths relative to expansion
sheaths. The second categorization is based on speed variations across sheaths.
Employing linear least squares regression, we categorize four distinct speed
profiles of the sheath plasma. We find that the associated shock properties and
solar cycle phase do not impact the occurrence of such variations. Our results
also highlight that the properties of the driving MEs are a major source of
variability in the sheath properties. Through logistic regression, we conclude
that the magnetic field strength and the ME speed in the frame of the solar
wind are likely drivers of these speed variations.

spectral variation of bodies with neutral-sloped spectra like that of Nereid.
Magnetite in particular provides a good match to the spectral continuum without

Then a new federated acquisition function is proposed for the central server to
approximate the objective values using the global surrogate and estimate the
uncertainty level of the approximated objective values based on the local

Memory (LSTM) variants, have been widely used as a deep learning tool for
tackling sequence-based learning tasks in text and speech. Training of such
LSTM applications is computationally intensive due to the recurrent nature of
hidden state computation that repeats for each time step. While sparsity in
Deep Neural Nets has been widely seen as an opportunity for reducing
computation time in both training and inference phases, the usage of non-ReLU
activation in LSTM RNNs renders the opportunities for such dynamic sparsity
associated with neuron activation and gradient values to be limited or
non-existent. In this work, we identify dropout induced sparsity for LSTMs as a
suitable mode of computation reduction. Dropout is a widely used regularization
mechanism, which randomly drops computed neuron values during each iteration of
training. We propose to structure dropout patterns, by dropping out the same
set of physical neurons within a batch, resulting in column (row) level hidden
state sparsity, which are well amenable to computation reduction at run-time in
general-purpose SIMD hardware as well as systolic arrays. We conduct our
experiments for three representative NLP tasks: language modelling on the PTB

transformations into their models to generalize their performance to previously
unseen data. These transformations are typically selected from a set of
functions that are known to maintain the identity of an input when applied
(e.g., rotation, translation, flipping, and scaling). However, there are many
natural variations that cannot be labeled for supervision or defined through
examination of the data. As suggested by the manifold hypothesis, many of these
natural variations live on or near a low-dimensional, nonlinear manifold.
Several techniques represent manifold variations through a set of learned Lie
group operators that define directions of motion on the manifold. However,
these approaches are limited because they require transformation labels when
training their models and they lack a method for determining which regions of
the manifold are appropriate for applying each specific operator. We address
these limitations by introducing a learning strategy that does not require
transformation labels and developing a method that learns the local regions
where each operator is likely to be used while preserving the identity of
inputs. Experiments on MNIST and Fashion MNIST highlight our model's ability to

the chemical reaction rate of droplets. In our systems, a surface-active

remote sensing and optical communications. Compared to other coupling
architectures, laterally coupled lasers are especially desirable since they
allow for denser integration and simpler fabrication process. Here, we present
the theoretical effects of varying the spontaneous emission factor $\beta$, an
important parameter for micro- and nanoscale lasers, on the stability
conditions of phase-locking for two laterally coupled semiconductor lasers.
Through bifurcation analyses, we observe that increasing $\beta$ contributes to
the expanding of the in-phase stability region under all scenarios considered,
including complex coupling coefficients, varying pump rates, and frequency
detuning. Moreover, the effect is more pronounced for $\beta$ approaching 1,
thus underlining the significant advantages of implementing nanolasers with

next-generation optical phased arrays requiring wide scanning angles with

discrepancies (KSD) are promising approaches to validate general unnormalised
distributions in various scenarios. Existing works focused on studying kernel
choices to boost test performances. However, the choices of (non-unique) Stein
operators also have considerable effect on the test performances. Inspired by
the standardisation technique that was originally developed to better derive
approximation properties for normal distributions, we present a unifying
framework, called standardisation-function kernel Stein discrepancy (Sf-KSD),
to study different Stein operators in KSD-based tests for goodness-of-fit. We
derive explicitly how the proposed framework relates to existing KSD-based
tests and show that Sf-KSD can be used as a guide to develop novel kernel-based
non-parametric tests on complex data scenarios, e.g. truncated distributions or
compositional data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed tests
control type-I error well and achieve higher test power than existing
approaches.

empirical evidence on the association between the diversity and density of
urban functions in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area, using a robust density index

achieve an unprecedented control of the pump depletion: pump-to-frequency comb

multi-agent systems are applied in a growing range of real-world problems that
involve heterogeneous tasks and uncertain information. Most previous works
assume one fixed way to decompose a task into roles that can later be assigned

can vary and multiple decomposition structures exist. Meanwhile, it is unclear
how uncertainties in task requirements and agent capabilities can be
systematically quantified and optimized under a multi-agent system setting. A
representation for complex tasks is proposed: agent capabilities are
represented as a vector of random distributions, and task requirements are
verified by a generalizable binary function. The conditional value at risk

remains a crucial and open question in cosmology. Solutions to understand this
tension are possible hidden sources of systematic error in the observable

work, we investigate a solution to the H$_0$ tension by modifying $\Lambda$CDM

$\rho_{ex}$ leaves distinctive imprints in the matter power spectrum at scales
$k \sim k_c$ with $k_c=a_cH(a_c)$ and in the CMB power spectrum, allowing for

and represent user preferences. Traditional SR methods rely on the next item as
the supervision signal to guide preference extraction and representation. We
propose a novel learning strategy, named preference editing. The idea is to
force the SR model to discriminate the common and unique preferences in
different sequences of interactions between users and the recommender system.
By doing so, the SR model is able to learn how to identify common and unique
user preferences, and thereby do better user preference extraction and
representation. We propose a transformer based SR model, named MrTransformer
(Multi-preference Transformer), that concatenates some special tokens in front
of the sequence to represent multiple user preferences and makes sure they
capture different aspects through a preference coverage mechanism. Then, we
devise a preference editing-based self-supervised learning mechanism for
training MrTransformer which contains two main operations: preference
separation and preference recombination. The former separates the common and
unique user preferences for a given pair of sequences. The latter swaps the
common preferences to obtain recombined user preferences for each sequence.
Based on the preference separation and preference recombination operations, we
define two types of SSL loss that require that the recombined preferences are
similar to the original ones, and the common preferences are close to each
other.
  We carry out extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets. MrTransformer
with preference editing significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SR methods
in terms of Recall, MRR and NDCG. We find that long sequences whose user
preferences are harder to extract and represent benefit most from preference
editing.

must; and 2) pseudo labels should be clean during self-training, making
critical tasks relying on semantic segmentation unreliable. Aiming at these
pitfalls, this study develops a domain adaptive solution to semantic
segmentation with pseudo label rectification (namely \textit{PR-SFDA}), which
operates in two phases: 1) \textit{Confidence-regularized unsupervised
learning}: Maximum squares loss applies to regularize the target model to
ensure the confidence in prediction; and 2) \textit{Noise-aware pseudo label

training, meanwhile positive learning achieves fast convergence. Extensive
experiments have been performed on domain adaptive semantic segmentation

performance of 49.0 mIoU, which is very close to that of the state-of-the-art

are gaining popularity to accelerate Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) since it
alleviates the ""memory wall"" problem associated with von-Neumann architecture.
The hardware efficiency (energy, latency and area) as well as application
accuracy (considering device and circuit non-idealities) of DNNs mapped to such
hardware are co-dependent on network parameters, such as kernel size, depth
etc. and hardware architecture parameters such as crossbar size. However,
co-optimization of both network and hardware parameters presents a challenging
search space comprising of different kernel sizes mapped to varying crossbar
sizes. To that effect, we propose NAX -- an efficient neural architecture
search engine that co-designs neural network and IMC based hardware
architecture. NAX explores the aforementioned search space to determine kernel
and corresponding crossbar sizes for each DNN layer to achieve optimal
tradeoffs between hardware efficiency and application accuracy. Our results
from NAX show that the networks have heterogeneous crossbar sizes across
different network layers, and achieves optimal hardware efficiency and accuracy
considering the non-idealities in crossbars. On CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet, our
models achieve 0.8%, 0.2% higher accuracy, and 17%, 4% lower EDAP

light particle multiplicities show a strong $\alpha$ clusterization at low

those in the reconstruction technique for the primary fragmenting source hinder

used large-scale datasets that contain many utterances for each speaker.
However, the datasets to train a PVAD model are often limited because
substantial cost is needed to prepare such a dataset. In addition, we cannot
utilize the datasets used to train the standard VAD because they often lack

variability between the input and the enrollment speech while keeping the

SNe~Ia, but at redder wavelengths they diverge. Unlike other luminous SNe~Ia,
2003fg-like generally have only one $i$-band maximum which peaks after the
epoch of $B$-band maximum, while their NIR light curve rise times can be
$\gtrsim$40 days longer than those of normal SNe~Ia. They are also at least one
magnitude brighter in the NIR bands than normal SNe~Ia, peaking above $M_H <
-19$~mag, and generally have negative Hubble residuals, which may be the cause
of some systematics in dark energy experiments. Spectroscopically, 2003fg-like
exhibit peculiarities such as unburnt carbon well past maximum light, a large
spread (8000--12000~km/s) in SiII $\lambda$6355 velocities at maximum light
with no rapid early velocity decline, and no clear $H$-band break at +10~d, e.
We find that SNe with a larger pseudo equivalent width of CII at maximum light
have lower SiII $\lambda$6355 velocities and slower declining light curves.
There are also multiple factors that contribute to the peak luminosity of
2003fg-like. The explosion of a C-O degenerate core inside a carbon-rich
envelope is consistent with these observations. Such a configuration may come
from the core degenerate scenario.

subword/sub-entity units is constructed from anchor nodes in a graph with known
relation types. Given such a fixed-size vocabulary, it is possible to bootstrap
an encoding and embedding for any entity, including those unseen during
training. Experiments show that NodePiece performs competitively in node
classification, link prediction, and relation prediction tasks while retaining
less than 10% of explicit nodes in a graph as anchors and often having 10x
fewer parameters. To this end, we show that a NodePiece-enabled model

technology, which is capable of providing ultra-high-rate transmission up to
Terabit per second. However, some hardware imperfections, which are generally
neglected in the existing literature concerning lower data rates and
traditional operating frequencies, cannot be overlooked in the THz systems.
Hardware imperfections usually consist of phase noise, in-phase/quadrature
imbalance, and nonlinearity of power amplifier. Due to the time-variant
characteristic of phase noise, frequent pilot insertion is required, leading to
decreased spectral efficiency. In this paper, to address this issue, a novel
pilot design strategy is proposed based on index modulation (IM), where the
positions of pilots are flexibly changed in the data frame, and additional
information bits can be conveyed by indices of pilots. Furthermore, a turbo
receiving algorithm is developed, which jointly performs the detection of pilot
indices and channel estimation in an iterative manner. It is shown that the
proposed turbo receiver works well even under the situation where the prior
knowledge of channel state information is outdated. Analytical and simulation
results validate that the proposed schemes achieve significant enhancement of
bit-error rate performance and channel estimation accuracy, whilst attaining
higher spectral efficiency in comparison with its classical counterpart.

pre-training on unlabeled data. Despite its success, it is still challenging to
adapt typical SSL methods to volume/sequence segmentation, due to their lack of
mining on local semantic discrimination and rare exploitation on volume and
sequence structures. Based on the continuity between slices/frames and the
common spatial layout of organs across volumes/sequences, we introduced a novel
bootstrap self-supervised representation learning method by leveraging the
predictable possibility of neighboring slices. At the core of our method is a
simple and straightforward dense self-supervision on the predictions of local
representations and a strategy of predicting locals based on global context,
which enables stable and reliable supervision for both global and local
representation mining among volumes. Specifically, we first proposed an
asymmetric network with an attention-guided predictor to enforce
distance-specific prediction and supervision on slices within and across
volumes/sequences. Secondly, we introduced a novel prototype-based
foreground-background calibration module to enhance representation consistency.
The two parts are trained jointly on labeled and unlabeled data. When evaluated
on three benchmark datasets of medical volumes and sequences, our model
outperforms existing methods with a large margin of 4.5\% DSC on ACDC, 1.7\% on

additional channels with reduced activation barriers resulting from the large

from $\sim$ 12 d before to $\sim 389$ d after maximum brightness. SN 2017fgc is
similar to normal SNe Ia, with an absolute peak magnitude of $M_{\rm max}^{B}
\approx$ $-19.32 \pm 0.13$ mag and a post-peak decline of ${\Delta}m_{15}(B)$ =
$1.05 \pm 0.07$ mag. Its peak bolometric luminosity is derived as $1.32 \pm
0.13) \times 10^{43} $erg s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.51
\pm 0.03 M_{\odot}$. The light curves of SN 2017fgc are found to exhibit excess
emission in the $UBV$ bands in the early nebular phase and pronounced secondary
shoulder/maximum features in the $RrIi$ bands. Its spectral evolution is
similar to that of HV SNe Ia, with a maximum-light Si II velocity of $15,000
\pm 150 $km s$^{-1}$ and a post-peak velocity gradient of $\sim$ $120 \pm 10
$km s$^{-1} $d$^{-1}$. The Fe II and Mg II lines blended near 4300 {\AA} and
the Fe II, Si II, and Fe III lines blended near 4800 {\AA} are obviously
stronger than those of normal SNe Ia. Inspecting a large sample reveals that
the strength of the two blends in the spectra, and the secondary peak in the
$i/r$-band light curves, are found to be positively correlated with the
maximum-light Si II velocity. Such correlations indicate that HV SNe~Ia may
experience more complete burning in the ejecta and/or that their progenitors
have higher metallicity. Examining the birthplace environment of SN 2017fgc
suggests that it likely arose from a stellar environment with young and
high-metallicity populations.

innovative methodologies of agile project management and is attended by 25

contexts, including higher education. During the approach preparation, we
decided to use challenges, problems, or questions from the industry. Thus, we
acquired four companies and prepared in coordination with them dedicated
project descriptions. Each project description was refined in the form of a
backlog (list of requirements). We divided the class into four eduScrum teams,
one team for each project. The subdivision of the class was done randomly.
Since we wanted to integrate realistic projects into industry partners'
implementation, we decided to adapt the eduScrum approach. The eduScrum teams
were challenged with different projects, e.g., analyzing a dedicated phenomenon
in a real project or creating a theoretical model for a company's new project
management approach. We present our experiences of the whole process to
prepare, perform and evaluate an agile educational approach combined with
projects from practice. We found, that the students value the agile method

small-voltage hysteresis between charge and discharge curves, have been
investigated as a function of temperature and frequency by an impedance
spectroscopy. The detailed analyses of the impedance data in the form of
dc-conductivity, ac-conductivity, electrical modulus, dielectric constant and
complex polarizability reveal a long-range Na-ionic conductivity with
negligible contribution from a local dipole relaxation. A significant
enhancement (~10^4 times) of the Na-ion conductivity has been found with the
increasing temperature from 353 K to 713 K. The temperature dependent
conductivity reveals thermally activated conduction process with activation
energies of 0.161 and 0.377 eV over the two temperature regions of 383-518 K
and 518-713 K, respectively. AC conductivity study reveals a long-range hopping
process for the conduction of charge carriers with a sharp increase of the
hopping range at 518 K. The scaling study of the ac-conductivity reveals that
the frequency-activated conductivity (above 10^4 Hz at 353 K) is mainly
controlled by the critical frequency that increases with the increasing
temperature. The Na-ion conduction in Na2Mn3O7 occurs predominantly by a
correlated barrier hopping process. Besides, a correlation between ionic
conduction and crystal structure has been established by x-ray and neutron
diffraction study. We have further shown that the conductivity of Na2Mn3O7 can
be enhanced by reduction of the stacking faults in the crystal structure. Our
study facilitates the understanding of the microscopic ionic conduction
mechanism in the highly efficient 2D battery material Na2Mn3O7 having high
energy storage capacity and high structural stability, paving way for the

however a challenge since Anderson localization is difficult to achieve in
optics and nonlinear mode interaction compromise its observation. Here, we
exhibit individually each lasing mode of a low-dimension solid-state random
laser by applying a non-uniform optical gain. By undoing gain competition and
cross-saturation, we demonstrate that all lasing modes are spatially localized.
We find that selective excitation reduces significantly the lasing threshold
while lasing efficiency is greatly improved. We show further how their spatial
location is critical to boost laser power-efficiency. By efficiently
suppressing spatial hole burning effect, we can turn on the
optimally-outcoupled random lasing modes. Our demonstration opens the road to
the exploration of linear and nonlinear mode interactions in the presence of

delicate analysis in anisotropic Sobolev spaces. Our method is also completely

collected a new dataset of cough sounds, labelled with clinician's diagnosis.
The chosen model is a bidirectional long-short term memory network (BiLSTM)
based on Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) features. The resulting
trained model when trained for classifying two classes of coughs -- healthy or
pathology (in general or belonging to a specific respiratory pathology),

the physicians' diagnosis. In order to classify subject's respiratory pathology
condition, results of multiple cough epochs per subject were combined. The
resulting prediction accuracy exceeds 91\% for all three respiratory
pathologies. However, when the model is trained to classify and discriminate
among the four classes of coughs, overall accuracy dropped: one class of
pathological coughs are often misclassified as other. However, if one consider
the healthy cough classified as healthy and pathological cough classified to
have some kind of pathologies, then the overall accuracy of four class model is
above 84\%. A longitudinal study of MFCC feature space when comparing
pathological and recovered coughs collected from the same subjects revealed the
fact that pathological cough irrespective of the underlying conditions occupy

In a variety of applications, dynamic imaging techniques are utilized to

acquired for the same subject at different time points. Although
signal-to-noise ratio of each time frame is usually limited by the short
acquisition time, the correlation among different time frames can be exploited
to improve denoising results with shared information across time frames. With
the success of neural networks in computer vision, supervised deep learning
methods show prominent performance in single-image denoising, which rely on
large datasets with clean-vs-noisy image pairs. Recently, several
self-supervised deep denoising models have been proposed, achieving promising
results without needing the pairwise ground truth of clean images. In the field
of multi-image denoising, however, very few works have been done on extracting
correlated information from multiple slices for denoising using self-supervised

combines single-image and multi-image denoising to improve image quality and
use a spatial transformer network to model motion between different slices.
Further, it only requires a single noisy image with a few auxiliary
observations at different time frames for training and inference. Evaluations
on phantom and in vivo data with different noise statistics show that our

alternating runs polynomials defined on a dual set of Stirling permutations.
  Furthermore, we prove that the Hurwitz stability of any symmetric polynomial
implies its semi-$\gamma$-positivity. We study a class of symmetric polynomials
and derive many nice properties including Hurwitz stability,
semi-$\gamma$-positivity, non $\gamma$-positivity, unimodality, strong

between a polynomial and its reciprocal polynomial, which implies the
alternatingly increasing property. This criterion extends a result of
Br\""and\'en and Solus and unifies such properties for many combinatorial
polynomials, including ascent polynomials for $k$-ary words, descent

conducted to identify the causes of the changes (e.g., artificial,

breaks, including mean and trend shifts, are fitted to the series and compared
via two commonly used multiple changepoint penalized likelihood criteria that
balance model fit quality (as measured by likelihood) against parsimony
considerations. Our changepoint model fits, with independent and short-memory
errors, are also compared with a different class of models termed long-memory
models that have been previously used by other authors to describe persistence
features in temperature series. In the end, the optimal model is judged to be
one containing a changepoint in the late 1980s, with a transition to an
intensified warming regime. This timing and warming conclusion is consistent
across changepoint models compared in this analysis. The variability of the
series is not found to be significantly changing, and shift features are judged
to be more plausible than either short- or long-memory autocorrelations. The
final proposed model is one including trend-shifts (both intercept and slope
parameters) with independent errors. The analysis serves as a walk-through

fairness definitions are typically defined with respect to specified protected
groups -- camouflaging the fact that these groupings are artificial and carry
historical and political motivations -- we emphasize that there are no ground
truth identities. For instance, should South and East Asians be viewed as a
single group or separate groups? Should we consider one race as a whole or
further split by gender? Choosing which groups are valid and who belongs in
them is an impossible dilemma and being ""fair"" with respect to Asians may
require being ""unfair"" with respect to South Asians. This motivates the
introduction of definitions that allow algorithms to be \emph{oblivious} to the
relevant groupings.
  We define several intuitive notions of group fairness and study their
incompatibilities and trade-offs. We show that the natural extension of
demographic parity is strongly dependent on the grouping, and \emph{impossible}
to achieve obliviously. On the other hand, the conceptually new definition we
introduce, Conditional Proportional Representation, can be achieved obliviously
through Posterior Sampling. Our experiments validate our theoretical results
and achieve fair image reconstruction using state-of-the-art generative models.

adults which has been on a constant rise. Elderly people have several needs and
requirements due to physical disabilities, cognitive issues, weakened memory
and disorganized behavior, that they face with increasing age. The extent of
these limitations also differs according to the varying diversities in elderly,
which include age, gender, background, experience, skills, knowledge and so on.
These varying needs and challenges with increasing age, limits abilities of
older adults to perform Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in an independent
manner. To add to it, the shortage of caregivers creates a looming need for
technology-based services for elderly people, to assist them in performing
their daily routine tasks to sustain their independent living and active aging.
To address these needs, this work consists of making three major contributions
in this field. First, it provides a rather comprehensive review of assisted
living technologies aimed at helping elderly people to perform ADLs. Second,
the work discusses the challenges identified through this review, that
currently exist in the context of implementation of assisted living services
for elderly care in Smart Homes and Smart Cities. Finally, the work also
outlines an approach for implementation, extension and integration of the
existing works in this field for development of a much-needed framework that
can provide personalized assistance and user-centered behavior interventions to
elderly as per their varying and ever-changing needs.

those methods usually focus on artificial scenarios where examples share almost

have broadly reproduced the light curve of V2491 Cyg by a nova outburst model
on a cold $1.36~M_\odot$ white dwarf (WD), which strongly suggests that V2491
Cyg is a classical nova outbursting on a cold very massive WD rather than a
recurrent nova outbursting on a warmer WD like the recurrent nova RS Oph. In a
long-term evolution of a cataclysmic binary, an accreting WD has been settled
down to a thermal equilibrium state with the balance of gravitational energy
release and neutrino loss. The central temperature of the WD is uniquely
determined by the energy balance. The WD is hot (cold) for a high (low)
mass-accretion rate. We present the central temperatures, ignition masses,
ignition radii, and recurrence periods for various WD masses and mass-accretion
rates. In a classical nova, which corresponds to a low mass-accretion rate, the
WD is cool and strongly degenerated and the ignition mass is large, which
result in a strong nova outburst. In a recurrent nova, the WD is relatively
warmer because of a high mass accretion rate and the outburst is relatively
weaker. The gravitational energy release substantially contributes to the
luminosity during the recurrent nova outbursts. We compare physical properties
between classical novae and recurrent novae and discuss the essential
differences between them.

years, it's still a challenge to design high accuracy algorithms with real-time
performance. In this paper, we propose a real-time instance segmentation
framework termed OrienMask. Upon the one-stage object detector YOLOv3, a mask
head is added to predict some discriminative orientation maps, which are
explicitly defined as spatial offset vectors for both foreground and background
pixels. Thanks to the discrimination ability of orientation maps, masks can be
recovered without the need for extra foreground segmentation. All instances
that match with the same anchor size share a common orientation map. This
special sharing strategy reduces the amortized memory utilization for mask
predictions but without loss of mask granularity. Given the surviving box
predictions after NMS, instance masks can be concurrently constructed from the
corresponding orientation maps with low complexity. Owing to the concise design
for mask representation and its effective integration with the anchor-based
object detector, our method is qualified under real-time conditions while
maintaining competitive accuracy. Experiments on COCO benchmark show that
OrienMask achieves 34.8 mask AP at the speed of 42.7 fps evaluated with a
single RTX 2080 Ti. The code is available at https://github.com/duwt/OrienMask.

minimum number of edges that are left uncovered by any set of three perfect
matchings. Since a cubic graph has defect $0$ if and only if it is
$3$-edge-colourable, this invariant can measure how much a cubic graph differs
from a $3$-edge-colourable graph. Our aim is to examine the relationship of
colouring defect to oddness, an extensively studied measure of uncolourability
of cubic graphs, defined as the smallest number of odd circuits in a
$2$-factor. We show that there exist cyclically $5$-edge-connected snarks
(cubic graphs with no $3$-edge-colouring) of oddness $2$ and arbitrarily large
colouring defect. This result is achieved by means of a construction of
cyclically $5$-edge-connected snarks with oddness $2$ and arbitrarily large
girth. The fact that our graphs are cyclically $5$-edge-connected significantly
strengthens a similar result of Jin and Steffen (2017), which only guarantees
graphs with cyclic connectivity at most $3$. At the same time, our result
improves Kochol's original construction of snarks with large girth (1996) in
that it provides infinitely many nontrivial snarks of any prescribed girth
$g\ge 5$, not just girth at least~$g$.

new classes of consistent theories for massless isolated systems are explicitly
determined. On the other hand, the approach determines definite constraints
implied by the invariance principle; they were ignored by some past
investigations that, as a consequence, turn out to be not consistent with the

  This paper investigates the sensitivity of global measures of communicability

and the associated left and right eigenvectors.
  Finding what local changes lead to the largest changes in global
communicability has many potential applications, including assessing the
resilience of a system to failure or attack, guidance for incremental system
improvements, and studying the sensitivity of global communicability measures

PET, homeland security or astronomy. Compared with traditional calibration
methods, this new technique can accurately calibrate a photon-counting
detector, including DOI information, with greatly reduced time. The enabling
part of this technique is fan-beam scanning combined with a data-processing
strategy called the common-data subset (CDS) method, which was used to
synthesize the detector's mean detector response functions (MDRFs). Using this
approach, $2N$ scans ($N$ in x and $N$ in y direction) are necessary to finish
calibration of a 2D detector as opposed to $N^2$ scans with a pencil beam. For
a 3D detector calibration, only $3N$ scans are necessary to achieve the 3D
detector MDRFs that include DOI information. Moreover, this calibration
technique can be used for detectors with complicated or irregular MDRFs. We
present both Monte-Carlo simulations and experimental results that support the
feasibility of this method.

importantly, their TSSs on the (010) surface are within the band gap of bulk

fact that both YRuB$_{2}$ and LuRuB$_{2}$ are superconductors with respective
superconducting transition temperatures ($T_c$) of 7.6 K and 10.2 K, the
superconducting bulks will likely induce superconductivity in the TSSs via the
proximity effect. The ternary borides $R$RuB$_{2}$ may thus provide a very
promising platform for studying the properties of topological superconductivity

probably due to its unique theoretical properties. The main drawback with
Shapley values, however, is that its computational complexity grows
exponentially in the number of input features, making it unfeasible in many
real world situations where there could be hundreds or thousands of features.
Furthermore, with many (dependent) features, presenting/visualizing and
interpreting the computed Shapley values also becomes challenging. The present
paper introduces groupShapley: a conceptually simple approach for dealing with
the aforementioned bottlenecks. The idea is to group the features, for example
by type or dependence, and then compute and present Shapley values for these
groups instead of for all individual features. Reducing hundreds or thousands
of features to half a dozen or so, makes precise computations practically
feasible and the presentation and knowledge extraction greatly simplified. We
prove that under certain conditions, groupShapley is equivalent to summing the
feature-wise Shapley values within each feature group. Moreover, we provide a
simulation study exemplifying the differences when these conditions are not
met. We illustrate the usability of the approach in a real world car insurance

Unlocking information trapped in these documents can enable researchers and
practitioners to operate confidently in the information world. Biomedical NER,
the task of recognising biomedical names, is usually employed as the first step
of the NLP pipeline. Standard NER models, based on sequence tagging technique,
are good at recognising short entity mentions in the generic domain. However,
there are several open challenges of applying these models to recognise
biomedical names: 1) Biomedical names may contain complex inner structure
(discontinuity and overlapping) which cannot be recognised using standard
sequence tagging technique; 2) The training of NER models usually requires
large amount of labelled data, which are difficult to obtain in the biomedical
domain; and, 3) Commonly used language representation models are pre-trained on
generic data; a domain shift therefore exists between these models and target
biomedical data. To deal with these challenges, we explore several research
directions and make the following contributions: 1) we propose a
transition-based NER model which can recognise discontinuous mentions; 2) We
develop a cost-effective approach that nominates the suitable pre-training
data; and, 3) We design several data augmentation methods for NER. Our
contributions have obvious practical implications, especially when new
biomedical applications are needed. Our proposed data augmentation methods can
help the NER model achieve decent performance, requiring only a small amount of
labelled data. Our investigation regarding selecting pre-training data can
improve the model by incorporating language representation models, which are
pre-trained using in-domain data. Finally, our proposed transition-based NER

epidemiological data (numbers of people tested, diagnoses, critical cases,

The data were characterized in terms of seasonality, stationarity, and
dependency spaces, and were extrapolated using machine learning techniques to
specify unknown epidemiological parameters of the model. At the second stage,
the Optuna optimizer based on the tree Parzen estimation method for objective
function minimization was applied to determine the model's unknown parameters.

a core graph query language GrAL is defined with focus on CONSTRUCT queries.
Queries in GrAL form the final step of a recursive process involving so-called
GrAL patterns. By evaluating a query over a graph one gets a graph, while by
evaluating a pattern over a graph one gets a set of matches which involves both
a graph and a table. CONSTRUCT queries are based on CONSTRUCT patterns, and
sub-CONSTRUCT patterns come for free from the recursive definition of patterns.
The semantics of GrAL is based on RDF graphs with a slight modification which
consists in accepting isolated nodes. Such an extension of RDF graphs eases the
definition of the evaluation semantics, which is mainly captured by a unique
operation called Merge. Besides, we define aggregations as part of GrAL
expressions, which leads to an original local processing of aggregations.

atoms are prepared in selected excited Bloch bands of an optical chequerboard
square lattice. For the spin-polarized case, extreme band lifetimes above
$10\,$s are observed, reflecting the suppression of collisions by Pauli's

magnitude by two-body collisions between different spin components, but still
remarkably large values of about one second are found. By analyzing momentum

in the plane of observables defined by the damping ratio and the oscillation
amplitude. The structure of the Bayesian evidence in this plane displays a
clear separation between the regions where each model is more plausible
relative to the other. There is qualitative agreement between the regions of
high marginal likelihood and Bayes factor for the nonlinear damping model and
the arrangement of observed data. A quantitative application to 101 loop
oscillation cases observed with SDO/AIA results in the marginal likelihood for
the nonlinear model being larger in the majority of them. The cases with
conclusive evidence for the nonlinear damping model outnumber considerably
those in favor of linear resonant absorption.

combination of an attention-based hierarchical encoder feeding summary

HBM in an amortized setup: once trained, it can readily be applied to a new
data sample to compute the parameters' full posterior.We demonstrate the
capability and scalability of our method on simulated data, as well as a
challenging high-dimensional brain parcellation experiment. We also open up
several questions that lie at the intersection between normalizing flows, SBI,
structured Variational Inference, and inference amortization.

Converter-Interfaced Distributed Energy Resources (CIDERs). This complicates
the analysis and mitigation of harmonics, whose creation and propagation are
facilitated by the interactions of converters and their controllers through the
grid. In this paper, a method for the calculation of the so-called Harmonic
Power-Flow (HPF) in three-phase grids with CIDERs is proposed. The
distinguishing feature of this HPF method is the generic and modular
representation of the system components. Notably, as opposed to most of the
existing approaches, the coupling between harmonics is explicitly considered.
The HPF problem is formulated by combining the hybrid nodal equations of the
grid with the closed-loop transfer functions of the CIDERs, and solved using
the Newton-Raphson method. The grid components are characterized by compound
electrical parameters, which allow to represent both transposed or
non-transposed lines. The CIDERs are represented by modular linear
time-periodic systems, which allows to treat both grid-forming and
grid-following control laws. The method's accuracy and computational efficiency

Results showed that the networks clearly classified illusory images and others
and reproduced illusory motions against various types of illusions similar to
human perception. Notably, the networks occasionally detected anomalous motion
vectors, even in ordinally static images where humans were unable to perceive
any illusory motion. Additionally, illusion-like designs with repeating

  interaction","Accepted for publication in A&A",,"10.1051/0004-6361/202141269",,"astro-ph.SR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Context. Binary evolution can result in fast-rotating stars, predicted to be
observable as Be stars, through accretion of angular momentum during
mass-transfer phases. Despite numerous observational evidence pointing to this
possibly being the dominant Be formation channel, current models struggle to
produce a satisfactory description of Be star populations.
  Aims. Given distinct uncertainties in detailed binary evolution calculations,
we investigate a rigorous and model independent upper limit for the production
of Be stars through binary interaction and aim to confront this limit with
observations of Be stars in young star clusters.
  Methods. Using extreme assumptions, we calculate the number ratio of
post-interaction to pre-interaction binary systems in a coeval population,
which describes an upper limit to Be star formation through mass-transfer. A
detailed comparison is made between our derived upper limit and relevant
observations of Be stars, which allows us to probe several aspects of binary
star physics.
  Results. We find that in coeval populations, binary interaction can at most
account for one third of all main-sequence stars being Be stars. Near the
cluster turn-off region, this limit appears to be realised in the clusters
studied. Away from the turn-off, applying simple assumptions about which
systems undergo unstable mass-transfer produces a good fit to the observed Be
fraction as a function of mass.
  Conclusions. We find that assuming distinct physics, binary evolution alone
can in principle match the high numbers of Be stars observed in open clusters.
Whether the required binary physics is realised in nature remains to be
investigated.

social network of several multiplayer games, yet we still know very little

how the game type and its mechanics are related to its community structure and
how those structures vary in different games. This paper presents an initial
analysis of Steam users and how friendships on Steam are formed around 200
games. We examine the friendship graphs of these 200 games by dividing them
into clusters to compare their network properties and their specific
characteristics (e.g., genre, game elements, and mechanics). We found how the
Steam user-defined tags better characterized the clusters than the game genre,
suggesting that how players perceive and use the game also reflects how they
connect in the community. Moreover, team-based games are associated with more
cohesive and clustered networks than games with a stronger single-player focus,
supporting the idea that playing together in teams more likely produces social
capital (i.e., Steam friendships).

similar pattern, i.e., the papillary architecture, yet some subtle differences,
including cellular and cell-layer level patterns. However, the cellular and
cell-layer level patterns almost cannot be captured by existing CNN-based
models in large-size histopathological images, which brings obstacles to
directly applying these models to such a fine-grained classification task. This
paper proposes a novel instance-based Vision Transformer (i-ViT) to learn
robust representations of histopathological images for the pRCC subtyping task
by extracting finer features from instance patches (by cropping around
segmented nuclei and assigning predicted grades). The proposed i-ViT takes
top-K instances as input and aggregates them for capturing both the cellular
and cell-layer level patterns by a position-embedding layer, a grade-embedding
layer, and a multi-head multi-layer self-attention module. To evaluate the
performance of the proposed framework, experienced pathologists are invited to
selected 1162 regions of interest from 171 whole slide images of type 1 and
type 2 pRCC. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better
performance than existing CNN-based models with a significant margin.

paper, we extend these works to DVAE-based single-channel unsupervised speech
enhancement, hence exploiting both speech signals unsupervised representation
learning and dynamics modeling. We propose an unsupervised speech enhancement
algorithm that combines a DVAE speech prior pre-trained on clean speech signals

left well and two for right well for this atom molecular coupled system. Our

(chosen to be positive) and the coherent coupling interaction (which is
positive for bosons) facilitate the transmission of atoms and molecules from
left well to the right well when the population in the right well dominates
over that in the left well and is trapped for a period of time. Whereas in
absence of any one of these interactions probability of transient transmission
decreases. However in absence of both the interactions (dipole-dipole and
coherent coupling) i.e. when only the repulsive contact interaction is present,
it leads to self trapping in the left well for a period of time. It is also
shown that the signature of coherent coupling between atoms and molecules on
the density distribution of atoms in the double well potential is present both
in absence and presence of dipole-dipole interaction.

quantized, we may have a variant of it, called dark charge. Similar to the
electric charge, the dark charge neither commutes nor closes algebraically with
$SU(2)_L$. The condition of algebraic closure leads to a novel gauge extension,
$SU(2)_L \otimes U(1)_Y \otimes U(1)_N$, where $Y$ and $N$ determine the
electric and dark charges, respectively, apart from the color group. We argue
that the existence of the dark charge, thus $N$, leads to novel scenarios of
multi-component dark matter, in general. The dark matter stability is
determined by a residual (or dark charge) gauge symmetry isomorphic to an even
$Z_k$ discrete group, where $k$ is specified dependent on the value of the
neutrino dark charge. This residual symmetry divides the standard model
particles into distinct classes, which possibly accommodate dark matter, but
each dark matter candidate cannot decay due to the color and electric charge
conservation. We analyze in detail three specific models according to $k=2,4,6$
and determine the simplest dark matter candidates. For small $U(1)_N$ coupling,
the two-component dark matter scenarios implied by the dark charge successfully
explain the dark matter relic density and the recent XENON1T excess, as well as
the beam dump, neutrino scattering, and astrophysical bounds. Otherwise, for
large $U(1)_N$ coupling, we have multi-WIMPs coexisted beyond the weak scale.

image classification, benefiting from its powerful mapping capability among
medical images. However, these existing deep learning-based methods depend on
an enormous amount of carefully labeled images. Meanwhile, noise is inevitably
introduced in the labeling process, degrading the performance of models. Hence,
it's significant to devise robust training strategies to mitigate label noise
in the medical image classification tasks. Methods: In this work, we propose a
novel Bayesian statistics guided label refurbishment mechanism (BLRM) for DNNs
to prevent overfitting noisy images. BLRM utilizes maximum a posteriori
probability (MAP) in the Bayesian statistics and the exponentially
time-weighted technique to selectively correct the labels of noisy images. The
training images are purified gradually with the training epochs when BLRM is
activated, further improving classification performance. Results: Comprehensive
experiments on both synthetic noisy images (public OCT & Messidor datasets) and
real-world noisy images (ANIMAL-10N) demonstrate that BLRM refurbishes the
noisy labels selectively, curbing the adverse effects of noisy data. Also, the
anti-noise BLRM integrated with DNNs are effective at different noise ratio and
are independent of backbone DNN architectures. In addition, BLRM is superior to
state-of-the-art comparative methods of anti-noise. Conclusions: These
investigations indicate that the proposed BLRM is well capable of mitigating
label noise in medical image classification tasks.

nanostructured surfaces that exhibit reflectance approaching the theoretical
limit. This limit is termed the Schrodinger red and demands sharp spectral
transitions from ""stopband"" to a high reflectance ""passband"" with total
suppression of higher-order resonances at blue and green wavelengths. Current
approaches based on metallic or dielectric nanoantennas are insufficient to
simultaneously meet these conditions. Here, for the 1st time, we designed and
fabricated tall Si nanoantenna arrays on quartz substrate to support two
partially overlapping y polarized quasi bound-state-in-the-continuum (q-BIC)
modes in the red wavelengths with sharp spectral edges. These structures
produce possibly the most saturated and brightest reds with ~80% reflectance,
exceeding the red vertex in sRGB and even the cadmium red pigment. We employed
a gradient descent algorithm with structures supporting q BIC as the starting
point. Although the current design is polarization dependent, the proposed
paradigm has enabled us to achieve the elusive structural red and the design
principle could be generalized to Schrodinger's pixels of other colors. The
design is suitable for scale up using other nanofabrication techniques for
larger area applications, such as red pixels in displays, decorative coatings,
and miniaturized spectrometers with high wavelength selectivity.

results of several transport codes belonging to two families (BUU-like and
QMD-like) are compared among each other and to exact calculations. For BUU-like
codes, employing the test particle method, the results depend on the
combination of the number of test particles and the spread of the profile
functions that weight integration over space. These parameters can be properly
adapted to give a good reproduction of the analytical zero-sound features.
QMD-like codes, using molecular dynamics methods, are characterized by large
damping effects, attributable to the fluctuations inherent in their phase-space
representation. Moreover, for a given nuclear effective interaction, they
generally lead to slower density oscillations, as compared to BUU-like codes.
The latter problem is mitigated in the more recent lattice formulation of some
of the QMD codes. The significance of these results for the description of real

we consider the problem of computing, for each vertex $t\neq s$, $p$
edge-disjoint paths of minimum total cost from $s$ to $t$ in $G$. Suurballe and
Tarjan~[Networks, 1984] solved the above problem for $p=2$ by designing a
$O(m+n\log n)$ time algorithm which also computes a sparse \emph{single-source
$2$-multipath preserver}, i.e., a subgraph containing $2$ edge-disjoint paths
of minimum total cost from $s$ to every other vertex of $G$. The case $p \geq
3$ was left as an open problem.
  We study the general problem ($p\geq 2$) and prove that any graph admits a
sparse single-source $p$-multipath preserver with $p(n-1)$ edges. This size is
optimal since the in-degree of each non-root vertex $v$ must be at least $p$.
Moreover, we design an algorithm that requires $O(pn^2 (p + \log n))$ time to
compute both $p$ edge-disjoint paths of minimum total cost from the source to
all other vertices and an optimal-size single-source $p$-multipath preserver.
The running time of our algorithm outperforms that of a natural approach that
solves $n-1$ single-pair instances using the well-known \emph{successive
shortest paths} algorithm by a factor of $\Theta(\frac{m}{np})$ and is
asymptotically near optimal if $p=O(1)$ and $m=\Theta(n^2)$. Our results extend
naturally to the case of $p$ vertex-disjoint paths.

solutions to fairly general nonlinear diffusion equations for initial data
growing at infinity under suitable assumptions on local-energy estimates for
approximate solutions. A delicate issue for constructing local-energy solutions
resides in the identification of weak limits of nonlinear terms for approximate
solutions in a limiting procedure. Indeed, such an identification process often
needs the maximal monotonicity of nonlinear elliptic operators (involved in the
doubly-nonlinear equations) as well as uniform estimates for approximate
solutions; however, even the monotonicity is violated due to a localization of
the equations, which is also necessary to derive local-energy estimates for
approximate solutions. In the present paper, such an inconsistency will be
systematically overcome by reducing the original equation to a localized one,
where a (no longer monotone) localized elliptic operator will be decomposed
into the sum of a maximal monotone one and a perturbation, and by integrating
all the other relevant processes. Furthermore, the general framework developed
in the present paper will also be applied to the Finsler porous medium and fast
diffusion equations, which are variants of the classical PME and FDE and also
classified as a doubly-nonlinear equation.

devices. When compound nanowire shells are grown by directional deposition
techniques, the azimuthal position of the sources for the different
constituents in the growth reactor, substrate rotation, and nanowire
self-shadowing inevitably lead to sequential deposition. Here, we uncover for
In$_{0.15}$Ga$_{0.85}$As/GaAs shell quantum wells grown by molecular beam
epitaxy a drastic impact of this sequentiality on the luminescence efficiency.
The photoluminescence intensity of shell quantum wells grown with a flux
sequence corresponding to migration enhanced epitaxy, i. e. when As and the
group-III metals essentially do not impinge at the same time, is more than two
orders of magnitude higher than for shell quantum wells prepared with
substantially overlapping fluxes. Transmission electron microscopy does not
reveal any extended defects explaining this difference. Our analysis of
photoluminescence transients shows that co-deposition has two detrimental
microscopic effects. First, a higher density of electrically active point
defects leads to internal electric fields reducing the electron-hole wave
function overlap. Second, more point defects form that act as nonradiative
recombination centers. Our study demonstrates that the source arrangement of
the growth reactor, which is of mere technical relevance for planar structures,
can have drastic consequences for the materials properties of nanowire shells.

more than 10 s. Self-calibration methods might solve this issue in an
interferometer formed by 3 antenna/satellite systems, but the need for the 3rd
satellite increases mission costs. A frequency transfer is of special interest
to alleviate both performance and cost issues. A concept of 2-way optical
frequency transfer is examined to investigate its suitability to enable
space-to-space interferometry, in particular, to image the 'shadows' of black
holes from space. The concept, promising on paper, has been demonstrated by
tests. The laboratory test set-up is presented and the verification of the
temporal stability using standard analysis tool as TimePod has been passed. The
resulting Allan Deviation is dominated by the 1/$\tau$ phase noise trend since
the frequency transfer timescale of interest is shorter than 0.2 s. This trend
continues into longer integration times, as proven by the longest tests
spanning over a few hours. The Allan Deviation between derived 103.2 GHz
oscillators is $1.1\times10^{-14}/\tau$ within 10 ms < $\tau$ < 1,000 s that
degrades twice towards the longest delay 0.2 s. The worst case satisfies the
requirement with a margin of 11 times. The obtained coherence in the range of
0.997-0.9998 is beneficial for space VLBI at 557 GHz. The result is of special
interest to future science missions for black hole imaging from space.

can be explained as a consequence of the extended $s-$wave symmetry of the gap
within an intersite real space pairing scenario, leading to a good agreement
between the experiment and theory. In this work, we turn to a detailed analysis
of the influence of spin-orbit coupling on the LAO/STO phase diagram by
considering the atomic and the Rashba components. In particular, we analyze the
optimal carrier concentration for which the maximal $T_c$ is reached relative
to the Lifshitz transition point. We find that the a misalignment between the
two can be significantly enhanced by the spin-orbit splitting of the bands,
combined with the fact that superconductivity sets in when the Fermi level
passes the anticrossing induced by the spin-orbital hybridization. In the
presence of the external in-plane magnetic field, our calculations show
four-fold anisotropy with the paramagnetic limit largely exceeded for $B_{||}$
directed along the high symmetry points [01] and [01]. The obtained electron
concentration dependence of $B_{c||}$ reproduces the characteristic dome-like
shape reported in experiments and the estimated value of $B_{c||}$ corresponds

and distributed setting, with applications in radio channel assignment problems
when the communication relies on omni-directional antennas of the same power.
In this context it is important to bound not only the complexity of the
coloring algorithms, but also the number of colors used. In this paper, we
consider two natural distributed settings. In the location-aware setting (when
nodes know their coordinates in the plane), we give a constant time distributed
algorithm coloring any unit-disk graph $G$ with at most $4\omega(G)$ colors,
where $\omega(G)$ is the clique number of $G$. This improves upon a classical
3-approximation algorithm for this problem, for all unit-disk graphs whose
chromatic number significantly exceeds their clique number. When nodes do not
know their coordinates in the plane, we give a distributed algorithm in the
LOCAL model that colors every unit-disk graph $G$ with at most
$5.68\omega(G)+1$ colors in $O(\log^* n)$ rounds. This algorithm is based on a
study of the local structure of unit-disk graphs, which is of independent
interest. We conjecture that every unit-disk graph $G$ has average degree at
most $4\omega(G)$, which would imply the existence of a $O(\log n)$ round
algorithm coloring any unit-disk graph $G$ with (approximately) $4\omega(G)$
colors in the LOCAL model. We provide partial results towards this conjecture
using Fourier-analytical tools.

operating in an Otto cycle consisting of 4 stages of two alternating phases:
the isentropic phase is detached from any bath (thus a closed system) where the
natural frequency of the oscillator is changed from one value to another, and
the isothermal phase where the system (now rendered open) is put in contact
with one or two squeezed baths of different temperatures, whose nonequilibrium
dynamics follows the Hu-Paz-Zhang (HPZ) master equation for quantum Brownian
motion. The HPZ equation is an exact nonMarkovian equation which preserves the
positivity of the density operator and is valid for a) all temperatures, b)
arbitrary spectral density of the bath, and c) arbitrary coupling strength
between the system and the bath. Taking advantage of these properties we
examine some key foundational issues of theories of quantum open and squeezed
systems for these two phases of the quantum Otto engines. This include, i) the
nonMarkovian regimes for non-Ohmic, low temperature baths, ii) what to expect
in nonadiabatic frequency modulations, iii) strong system-bath coupling, as
well as iv) the proper junction conditions between these two phases. Our aim
here is not to present ways for attaining higher efficiency but to build a more
solid theoretical foundation for quantum engines of continuous variables

griefing, a practice according to which participants harm other participants at
some lesser cost to themselves, is a prevalent threat at its Nash equilibria.
The proof relies on a generalization of evolutionary stability to
non-homogeneous populations via griefing factors (ratios that measure network
losses relative to deviator's own losses) which leads to a formal theoretical
argument for the dissipation of resources, consolidation of power and high
entry barriers that are currently observed in practice.
  A critical assumption in this type of analysis is that miners' decisions have
significant influence in aggregate network outcomes (such as network hashrate).
However, as networks grow larger, the miner's interaction more closely
resembles a distributed production economy or Fisher market and its stability
properties change. In this case, we derive a proportional response (PR) update
protocol which converges to market equilibria at which griefing is irrelevant.
Convergence holds for a wide range of miners risk profiles and various degrees
of resource mobility between blockchains with different mining technologies.
Our empirical findings in a case study with four mineable cryptocurrencies
suggest that risk diversification, restricted mobility of resources (as
enforced by different mining technologies) and network growth, all are
contributing factors to the stability of the inherently volatile blockchain
ecosystem.

recent years, there has been an increasing interest in assessing the
performance deterioration of such detectors after the irradiation with proton

  In this work, samples of different FBK SiPM technologies, made with different
manufacturing technologies, were irradiated at the INFN-LNS facility (Italy)
with protons reaching fluences up to $10^{12}n_{eq}/mm^2$ (1 MeV neutron
equivalent) which correspond $10^{14}n_{eq}/cm^2$ to and their performances
were characterized in detail after an approximately 30 days room temperature
annealing. The results show a significant worsening of the primary noise (dark
count rate) of the detectors, which increases with the irradiation dose,
whereas the other performance parameters like the micro-cell gain, the
correlated noise probability and the photon detection efficiency do not show
significant variations over the investigated dose range. The breakdown voltage
estimation after irradiation is another important aspect for a SiPM. In this
contribution, we show several methods for its estimation and compare the
results. We also introduced new methodologies to characterize the performance
of the SiPMs when they present a very high level of noise.

defects inside the device, i.e. the defects that mostly contribute to the
increase of the DCR of the device, through the emission microscopy (EMMI)
technique. In particular, we analyzed the SiPMs at the single cell level,

convoluting the grayscale data using B-splines. A negative side-effect of this
convolution technique is, however, that it can induce topological changes in
the process of smoothing when features with a size similar to that of the
voxels are encountered. This manuscript presents an enhanced B-spline-based
segmentation procedure using a refinement strategy based on truncated
hierarchical (TH)B-splines. A Fourier analysis is presented to explain the
effectiveness of local grayscale function refinement in repairing topological
anomalies. A moving-window-based topological anomaly detection algorithm is
proposed to identify regions in which the grayscale function refinements must
be performed. The criterion to identify topological anomalies is based on the
Euler characteristic, giving it the capability to distinguish between
topological and shape changes. The proposed topology-preserving THB-spline
image segmentation strategy is studied using a range of test cases. These tests
pertain to both the segmentation procedure itself, and its application in an

nonrotating black holes, such as a Schwarzschild black hole. However, they fail
to work in the Kerr spacetime because not all variables can be separable, or
not all splitting parts have analytical solutions as explicit functions of
proper time. To cope with this difficulty, we introduce a time transformation
function to the Hamiltonian of Kerr geometry so as to obtain a time-transformed
Hamiltonian consisting of five splitting parts, whose analytical solutions are
explicit functions of the new coordinate time. The chosen time transformation
function can cause time steps to be adaptive, but it is mainly used to
implement the desired splitting of the time transformed Hamiltonian. In this
manner, new explicit symplectic algorithms are easily available. Unlike Runge
Kutta integrators, the newly proposed algorithms exhibit good long term
behavior in the conservation of Hamiltonian quantities when appropriate fixed
coordinate time steps are considered. They are better than same order implicit
and explicit mixed symplectic algorithms and extended phase space explicit
symplectic like methods in computational efficiency. The proposed idea on the
construction of explicit symplectic integrators is suitable for not only the
Kerr metric but also many other relativistic problems, such as a Kerr black
hole immersed in a magnetic field, a Kerr Newman black hole with an external
magnetic field, axially symmetric core shell systems, and five dimensional
black ring metrics.

adjacent to both $u$ and $w$ is called a $2$-geodesic if $u\neq w$ and $u,w$

automorphism group is transitive on both arcs and 2-geodesics. In previous work
the author showed that if a $2$-geodesic transitive graph $\Gamma$ is locally
disconnected and its automorphism group $\Aut(\Gamma)$ has a non-trivial normal
subgroup which is intransitive on the vertex set of $\Gamma$, then $\Gamma$ is
a cover of a smaller 2-geodesic transitive graph. Thus the `basic' graphs to
study are those for which $\Aut(\Gamma)$ acts quasiprimitively on the vertex
set. In this paper, we study 2-geodesic transitive graphs which are locally
disconnected and $\Aut(\Gamma)$ acts quasiprimitively on the vertex set. We
first determine all the possible quasiprimitive action types and give examples
for them, and then classify the family of $2$-geodesic transitive graphs whose
automorphism group is primitive on its vertex set of $\PA$ type.

correlated noise and constrain the potential biases incurred in the retrieved
posteriors. We simulate multiple noise instances of synthetic data and perform
retrievals to obtain statistics of goodness-of-retrieval for varying noise
models. We find that correlated noise allows for overfitting the spectrum,
thereby yielding better goodness-of-fit on average but degrading the overall
accuracy of retrievals. In particular, correlated noise can manifest as an
apparent non-Rayleigh slope in the optical range, leading to an incorrect
estimate of cloud/haze parameters. We also find that higher precision causes
correlated results to be further off from the input values in terms of
estimated errors. As such, we emphasize that caution must be taken in analyzing
retrieved posteriors and that estimated parameter uncertainties are best
understood as lower limits. Finally, we show that while correlated noise cannot
be be reliably distinguished with HST observations, inferring its presence and
strength may be possible with JWST observations.

bright scintillation maximum is simultaneous with the eclipse by the companion,
enabling precise measurements of variations in the flux density, dispersion
measure (DM), and scattering strength throughout the eclipse. The flux density
is highly variable throughout the eclipse, with a peak 1.7 times the average
away from the eclipse, and yet does not significantly decrease on average. We
recover the flux density variations from the measured DM variations using
geometric optics, with a relative velocity as the only free parameter. We
measure an effective velocity of (470 $\pm$ 10) km/s, consistent with the
relative orbital motion of the companion, suggesting that the outflow velocity
of the lensing material is low, or is directly along the line of sight. The 2
per cent uncertainty on the effective velocity is a formal error; systematics
related to our current model are likely to dominate, and we detail several
extensions to the model to be considered in a full treatment of lensing. This
is a demonstration of the causal link between DM and lensing; the flux density
variations can be predicted directly through the derivatives of DM. Going
forward, this approach can be applied to investigate the dynamics of other
eclipsing systems, and to investigate the physical nature of scintillation and
lensing in the ionized interstellar medium.

United States. In this study, we use a hierarchical Bayesian model to estimate
the age-specific COVID-19 attributable deaths over time in the United States.
The model is specified by a novel non-parametric spatial approach, a low-rank
Gaussian Process (GP) projected by regularised B-splines. We show that this
projection defines a new GP with attractive smoothness and computational
efficiency properties, derive its kernel function, and discuss the penalty
terms induced by the projected GP. Simulation analyses and benchmark results
show that the spatial approach performs better than standard B-splines and
Bayesian P-splines and equivalently well as a standard GP, for considerably
lower runtimes. The B-splines projected GP priors that we develop are likely an
appealing addition to the arsenal of Bayesian regularising priors. We apply the
model to weekly, age-stratified COVID-19 attributable deaths reported by the US
Centers for Disease Control, which are subject to censoring and reporting
biases. Using the B-splines projected GP, we can estimate longitudinal trends
in COVID-19 associated deaths across the US by 1-year age bands. These
estimates are instrumental to calculate age-specific mortality rates, describe
variation in age-specific deaths across the US, and for fitting epidemic
models. Here, we couple the model with age-specific vaccination rates to show
that lower vaccination rates in younger adults aged 18-64 are associated with
significantly stronger resurgences in COVID-19 deaths, especially in Florida
and Texas. These results underscore the critical importance of medically able
individuals of all ages to be vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to limit
fatal outcomes.

learns the wireless channel model and is involved in the Model Predictive
Controller to generate a control sequence that not only minimizes the
conventional motion costs, but also minimizes the estimated delay of the
wireless channel in the future. This results in a farsighted controller that
maximizes the amount of transferred information beyond the controller's time
horizon, which in turn guarantees the safety and optimality of the generated
trajectories in the future. To decrease computational cost, the algorithm finds
the reachable set from the current state and focuses on that region to minimize
the size of the kernel matrix and related calculations. In addition, we present

efficient MLP-like architecture for visual recognition. By realizing the
importance of the positional information carried by 2D feature representations,
unlike recent MLP-like models that encode the spatial information along the
flattened spatial dimensions, Vision Permutator separately encodes the feature
representations along the height and width dimensions with linear projections.
This allows Vision Permutator to capture long-range dependencies along one
spatial direction and meanwhile preserve precise positional information along
the other direction. The resulting position-sensitive outputs are then
aggregated in a mutually complementing manner to form expressive
representations of the objects of interest. We show that our Vision Permutators
are formidable competitors to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision
transformers. Without the dependence on spatial convolutions or attention
mechanisms, Vision Permutator achieves 81.5% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet without
extra large-scale training data (e.g., ImageNet-22k) using only 25M learnable
parameters, which is much better than most CNNs and vision transformers under
the same model size constraint. When scaling up to 88M, it attains 83.2% top-1
accuracy. We hope this work could encourage research on rethinking the way of
encoding spatial information and facilitate the development of MLP-like models.

accuracy at similar computational budgets; at high sparsity levels, AC/DC even
outperforms existing methods that rely on accurate pre-trained dense models. An
important property of AC/DC is that it allows co-training of dense and sparse

for deployment in resource-constrained settings without re-doing the entire

develop an approach that allows us to find a quantum state of the final photon
without projecting it onto a detector state. A general expression for this
so--called \textit{evolved} state of outgoing radiation is derived and it can
be used to analyze the resonant scattering by any ion, independently of its
shell structure. Here, we illustrate our approach with the strong electric
dipole $n S_{0} \to n' P_{1} \to n S_{0}$ transitions, which play an important
role for the Gamma Factory project at CERN. For the incident Bessel light, the
scattered radiation is shown to be in a superposition of twisted modes with the
projections of the total angular momentum $m_f = 0, \pm 1$. The larger values
of $m_f$ can be efficiently generated by inducing transitions of higher
multiplicity. This angular momentum transfer, together with a remarkable cross
section that is many orders of magnitude larger than that of the backward
Compton scattering, makes the resonant photon scattering an effective tool for
the production of twisted x-- and even gamma--rays at the Gamma Factory
facility.

leads to significant mass growth in the newly formed neutron star. This can
explain the formation of heavy binary neutron star systems such as GW190425, as

Finding the roles of event arguments like event participants is essential for
event extraction. However, doing so for real-life event descriptions is
challenging because an argument's role often varies in different contexts.
While the relationship and interactions between multiple arguments are useful
for settling the argument roles, such information is largely ignored by
existing approaches. This paper presents a better approach for event extraction
by explicitly utilizing the relationships of event arguments. We achieve this
through a carefully designed task-oriented dialogue system. To model the
argument relation, we employ reinforcement learning and incremental learning to
extract multiple arguments via a multi-turned, iterative process. Our approach
leverages knowledge of the already extracted arguments of the same sentence to
determine the role of arguments that would be difficult to decide individually.
It then uses the newly obtained information to improve the decisions of
previously extracted arguments. This two-way feedback process allows us to
exploit the argument relations to effectively settle argument roles, leading to
better sentence understanding and event extraction. Experimental results show
that our approach consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art event
extraction methods for the classification of events and argument role and
argument identification.

method we use up to 3000 electrons distributed over up to 5000 states for
almost macroscopic system size of 1000x1000nm. In particular, the formation of
compressible and in-compressible edge stripes turns out to develop essentially
different from the common picture used so far. Oppositely to the theory of
Chklovskii, Shklovskii and Glazman (CSG), the narrow channels, as assumed by
the early models of the IQHE, do not widen up into wide compressible stripes.
Instead, the wide compressible stripes of CSG transform into a mixture of
clusters of full and empty spin-split LLs, while the cluster boundaries create
a network of still narrow quantum channels sitting on top of the wide
compressible stripes. On this background the early models based on narrow edge
channels do not suffer from neglecting electron-electron interaction as falsely
stated in the past. Quite oppositely, in contrast to the common believe, our
modelling demonstrates that also the IQHE regime carries the hallmark of
many-body physics which stabilizes narrow edge channels also in the presence of

investigated the fairness of such models. In this work, we perform such an
analysis for racial/gender groups, focusing on the problem of training data
imbalance, using a nnU-Net model trained and evaluated on cine short axis
cardiac MR data from the UK Biobank dataset, consisting of 5,903 subjects from
6 different racial groups. We find statistically significant differences in
Dice performance between different racial groups. To reduce the racial bias, we
investigated three strategies: (1) stratified batch sampling, in which batch
sampling is stratified to ensure balance between racial groups; (2) fair
meta-learning for segmentation, in which a DL classifier is trained to classify
race and jointly optimized with the segmentation model; and (3) protected group
models, in which a different segmentation model is trained for each racial
group. We also compared the results to the scenario where we have a perfectly

skewed error ratio (SER) of the average Dice values. Our results demonstrate
that the racial bias results from the use of imbalanced training data, and that

signalling. A key cellular process is the exchange of neighbours via T1
transitions. We propose and analyse a model with positive feedback between
recruitment of myosin motors and mechanical tension in cell junctions. The
model produces active T1 events, which act to elongate the tissue perpendicular
to external pulling. Using an idealized tissue patch comprising several active
cells embedded in a matrix of passive hexagonal cells we identified an optimal
range of pulling forces to trigger an active T1 event. We show that pulling
also generates tension chains in a realistic patch made entirely of active
cells of random shapes, and leads to convergence-extension over a range of
parameters. Our findings show that active intercalations can generate stress
that activates T1 events in neighbouring cells resulting in tension dependent
tissue re-organisation, in qualitative agreement with experiments on
gastrulation in chick embryos.

population mortality tables are integrated into the estimation process, while
using the basic relative survival idea that the overall mortality hazard can be

because of theoretical difficulties, most of attempts have been limited only to
either linear or deterministic analysis even though real biological chemotactic
systems involve considerable stochasticity and nonlinearity in their sensory

currents in grids with distributed generation can be reduced to acceptable
levels, so there is no needed to change the protection relays settings of the
downstream grid (including distributed generations). However, by locating the
FCL in the tie-feeder, the downstream grid is not more effective than the
upstream grid and thus its reliability indices also will be changed. Therefore,
this paper shows that by locating the unidirectional fault current limiter

details in VFR images. Specifically, the dependency path is conducted based on
the ResT, a novel Transformer backbone with memory-efficient multi-head
self-attention, while the texture path is built on the stacked convolution
operation. Besides, using the linear attention mechanism, a feature aggregation
module is designed to effectively fuse the dependency features and texture

proton bunch to effectively drive wakefields and accelerate an electron bunch
to GeV-level energies. During the first experimental run (2016-2018) the
instability was made phase reproducible by means of a seeding process: a short
laser pulse co-propagates within the proton bunch in a rubidium vapor. Thus,
the fast creation of plasma and the onset of beam-plasma interaction within the
bunch drives seed wakefields. However, this seeding method leaves the front of
the bunch not modulated. The bunch front could self-modulate in a second,
preformed plasma and drive wakefields that would interfere with those driven by
the (already self-modulated) back of the bunch and with the acceleration
process. We present studies of the seeded the self-modulation (SSM) of a long
proton bunch using a short electron bunch. The short seed bunch is placed ahead
of the proton bunch leading to self-modulation of the entire bunch. Numerical
simulations show that this method have other advantages when compared to the
ionization front method. We discuss the requirements for the electron bunch
parameters (charge, emittance, transverse size at the focal point, length), to
effectively seed the self-modulation process. We also present preliminary
experimental studies on the electron bunch seed wakefields generation.

an uplink linear minimum mean-square error (L-MMSE) equalization method in the

pace, with atomically thin crystals of an increasing number of different
compounds that have become available, together with techniques enabling their
assembly into functional heterostructures. The strategy to detect these
atomically thin crystals has however remained unchanged since the discovery of
graphene. Such an absence of evolution is starting to pose problems because for
many of the 2D materials of current interest the optical contrast provided by
the commonly used detection procedure is insufficient to identify the presence
of individual monolayers or to determine unambiguously the thickness of
atomically thin multilayers. Here we explore an alternative detection strategy,
in which the enhancement of optical contrast originates from the use of
optically inhomogeneous substrates, leading to diffusively reflected light.
Owing to its peculiar polarization properties and to its angular distribution,
diffusively reflected light allows a strong contrast enhancement to be achieved
through the implementation of suitable illumination-detection schemes. We
validate this conclusion by carrying out a detailed quantitative analysis of
optical contrast, which fully reproduces our experimental observations on over
60 WSe$_2$ mono-, bi-, and trilayers. We further validate the proposed strategy
by extending our analysis to atomically thin phosphorene, InSe, and graphene
crystals. Our conclusion is that the use of diffusively reflected light to
detect and identify atomically thin layers is an interesting alternative to the
common detection scheme based on Fabry-Perot interference, because it enables
atomically thin layers to be detected on substrates others than the commonly
used Si/SiO$_2$, and it may offer higher sensitivity depending on the specific
2D material considered.

also mobile, e.g., swimming bacteria. In this case, both the infectious agent

waves with a fixed wave speed, as in FKPP theory, but the infected host wave
also grows exponentially. Depending on the population under consideration, wave
speeds are either advanced or retarded compared to the non-growing case. We
identify a novel speed selection mechanism in which the shape of the

typical forms for the oscillation probabilities mask these symmetries of the

presence of matter an \emph{additional} set of $2^7$ parameter symmetries exist
of the matter parameters. Due to the complexity of the exact expressions for
neutrino oscillations in matter, numerous approximations have been developed;
we show that under certain assumptions, approximate expressions have at most
$2^6$ additional parameter symmetries of the matter parameters. We also include
one parameter symmetry related to the LMA-Dark degeneracy that holds under the
assumption of CPT invariance; this adds one additional factor of two to all of
the above cases. Explicit, non-trivial examples are given of how physical
observables in neutrino oscillations, such as the probabilities, CP violation,
the position of the solar and atmospheric resonance, and the effective $\Delta
m^2$'s for disappearance probabilities, are invariant under all of the above
symmetries. We investigate which of these parameter symmetries apply to
numerous approximate expressions in the literature and show that a more careful
consideration of symmetries improves the precision of approximations.

were fabricated to understand the hysteresis phenomenon under a series of scan
rates. The experimental results show that the hysteresis phenomenon would be
affected by the dielectric constant of transport layers and scan rate
significantly. To explain this, a modified Poisson and drift-diffusion solver
coupled with a fully time-dependent ion migration model is developed to analyze
how the ion migration affects the performance and hysteresis of PSCs. The
simulation model was optimized for carrier transportation of organic materials,
which can simulate the organic transport layer correctly without using heavy
doping in simulating the organic transport layer. The modeling results show
that the most crucial factor in the hysteresis behavior is the built-in
electric field of the perovskite. The non-linear hysteresis curves are
demonstrated under different scan rates, and the mechanism of the hysteresis
behavior is explained. The findings reveal why the change in hysteresis degree
with scan rate is Gaussian shaped rather than monotonic. Additionally, other
factors contributing to the degree of hysteresis are determined to be the
degree of degradation in the perovskite material, the quality of the perovskite
crystal, and the materials of the transport layer, which corresponds to the
total ion density, carrier lifetime of perovskite, and the dielectric constant
of the transport layer, respectively. Finally, it was found that the dielectric
constant of the transport layer is a key factor affecting hysteresis in
perovskite solar cells; a lower dielectric constant corresponds to a higher
electric field of the transport layer. Hence, if the electric field of the
perovskite material is small, the degree of hysteresis is small and vice versa.

uninterrupted observations (up to about 47 hr, or 170 ksec, per satellite orbit
of 2.7 days) with a large field-of-view (fully coded: 100 deg^2), msec time
resolution, keV energy resolution, polarization measurements, as well as
additional coverage in the optical. This is realized by two main instruments in
the 15 keV to 10 MeV range, the spectrometer SPI (spectral resolution 3 keV at
1.8 MeV) and the imager IBIS (angular resolution 12 arcmin FWHM), complemented
by X-ray (JEM-X; 3-35 keV) and optical (OMC; Johnson V-band) monitors. All
instruments are co-aligned to simultaneously observe the target region. A
particle radiation monitor (IREM) measures charged particle fluxes near the
spacecraft. The Anti-coincidence subsystems of the main instruments are also
efficient all-sky gamma-ray detectors, which provide omni-directional
monitoring above ~75 keV. INTEGRAL can also rapidly (within a couple of hours)
re-point and conduct Target of Opportunity observations. INTEGRAL has build an
impressive legacy: e.g. discovery of >600 new high-energy sources; first-ever
direct detection of 56Ni and 56Co radio-active decay lines from a Type Ia
supernova; new insights on positron annihilation in the Galactic bulge and
disk; pioneering gamma-ray polarization studies. INTEGRAL is also a successful
in multi-messenger astronomy: INTEGRAL found the first prompt electromagnetic
radiation in coincidence with a binary neutron star merger. More than 1750
papers based on INTEGRAL data have been published in refereed journals. Here we
give a comprehensive update of the satellite status after more than 18 years of

are purported to provide humans with precise information about the image
features that cause a unit to be activated - an advantage over other
alternatives like strongly activating natural dataset samples. If humans indeed
gain causal insight from visualizations, this should enable them to predict the
effect of an intervention, such as how occluding a certain patch of the image
(say, a dog's head) changes a unit's activation. Here, we test this hypothesis
by asking humans to decide which of two square occlusions causes a larger
change to a unit's activation. Both a large-scale crowdsourced experiment and
measurements with experts show that on average the extremely activating feature
visualizations by Olah et al. (2017) indeed help humans on this task ($68 \pm
4$% accuracy; baseline performance without any visualizations is $60 \pm 3$%).
However, they do not provide any substantial advantage over other

($66\pm3$% to $67 \pm3$% accuracy). Taken together, we propose an objective
psychophysical task to quantify the benefit of unit-level interpretability

visualization method provides humans with better ""causal understanding"" of unit
activations than simple alternative visualizations.

stability analysis of a compositional discontinuity with a heating source term
that depends on composition. We also perform idealized two-dimensional (2D)
simulations of an opacity discontinuity in a stratified medium with the code
ARK. We use a two-stream grey model for radiative transfer and explore the
brown-dwarf and earth-like regimes. We reveal the existence of a Radiative
Rayleigh-Taylor Instability (RRTI hereafter, a particular case of diabatic
Rayleigh-Taylor instability) when an opacity discontinuity is present in a
stratified medium. This instability is similar in nature to diabatic convection
and relies only on buoyancy with radiative transfer heating and cooling. When
the temperature is decreasing with height in the atmosphere, a lower-opacity
medium on top of a higher-opacity medium is dynamically unstable while a
higher-opacity medium on top of a lower-opacity medium is stable. This
stability/instability behavior is reversed if the temperature is increasing
with height. The existence of the RRTI could have important implications for
the stability of the cloud cover of a wide range of planetary atmospheres. In
our solar system, it could help explain the formation of mammatus cloud in
Earth atmospheres and the existence of Venus cloud deck. Likewise, it suggests
that stable and large scale cloud covers could be ubiquitous in strongly
irradiated exoplanets but might be more patchy in low-irradiated or isolated

obtained for 2D images and 3D Lidar point clouds based on 2D and 3D

The experimental results show that the fusion strategy can significantly
improve the detection performance compared to the methods using only point
clouds, and the methods using point clouds only painted with 2D segmentation
information. Furthermore, the proposed approach outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods on the nuScenes testing benchmark.

psychological theories. Inspired by this, we propose a well-grounded

each emotion distribution is represented with an emotion vector, which is
defined with three attributes (i.e., emotion polarity, emotion type, emotion
intensity) as well as two properties (i.e., similarity, additivity). Besides,
we design a novel Progressive Circular (PC) loss to penalize the
dissimilarities between predicted emotion vector and labeled one in a
coarse-to-fine manner, which further boosts the learning process in an
emotion-specific way. Extensive experiments and comparisons are conducted on
public visual emotion distribution datasets, and the results demonstrate that
the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

e.g., in areas of energy, mobility, and production, network security monitoring
needs to be able to cope with those environments and their evolution. However,
state-of-the-art Network Security Monitors (NSMs) typically lack the necessary
flexibility to handle the diversity of the packet-oriented layers below the
abstraction of TCP/IP connections. In this work, we advance the software
architecture of a network security monitor to facilitate the flexible
integration of lower-layer protocol dissectors while maintaining required
performance levels. We proceed in three steps: First, we identify the
challenges for modular packet-level analysis, present a refined NSM
architecture to address them and specify requirements for its implementation.
Second, we evaluate the performance of data structures to be used for protocol
dispatching, implement the proposed design into the popular open-source NSM
Zeek and assess its impact on the monitor performance. Our experiments show
that hash-based data structures for dispatching introduce a significant
overhead while array-based approaches qualify for practical application.
Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed architecture and
implementation by migrating Zeek's previously hard-coded stack of link and
internet layer protocols to the new interface. Furthermore, we implement
dissectors for non-IP based industrial communication protocols and leverage
them to realize attack detection strategies from recent applied research. We
integrate the proposed architecture into the Zeek open-source project and
publish the implementation to support the scientific community as well as
practitioners, promoting the transfer of research into practice.

and Ramnarayan (HJMR) proposes a simple geometric model of opinion evolution
that provably exhibits strong polarization in specialized cases. Moreover,
polarization arises quite organically in their model: in each time step, each

drawn at random. However, their techniques do not seem to extend beyond a set
of special cases they identify, which benefit from fragile symmetry or
contractiveness assumptions, leaving open how general this phenomenon really
is.
  In this paper, we further the study of polarization in related geometric
models. We show that the exact form of polarization in such models is quite
nuanced: even when strong polarization does not hold, it is possible for weaker
notions of polarization to nonetheless attain. We provide a concrete example
where weak polarization holds, but strong polarization provably fails. However,
we show that strong polarization provably holds in many variants of the HJMR
model, which are also robust to a wider array of distributions of random issues

  In this paper we propose ranking models that are inherently interpretable by
generating explanations as a by-product of the prediction decision. We
introduce the Select-and-Rank paradigm for document ranking, where we first
output an explanation as a selected subset of sentences in a document.
Thereafter, we solely use the explanation or selection to make the prediction,
making explanations first-class citizens in the ranking process. Technically,
we treat sentence selection as a latent variable trained jointly with the
ranker from the final output. To that end, we propose an end-to-end training
technique for Select-and-Rank models utilizing reparameterizable subset
sampling using the Gumbel-max trick.
  We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our approach is
competitive to state-of-the-art methods. Our approach is broadly applicable to

interacting fermionic model that is often obtained in ab initio electronic
structure calculations and show that the corresponding spin problem can be
introduced even in the paramagnetic regime, which is characterized by a zero
average value of the magnetization. Further, we derive a physical criterion for
the formation of the local magnetic moment and confirm that the latter exists
already at high temperatures well above the transition to the ordered magnetic

electronic degrees of freedom and to carefully separate rotational dynamics of
the local magnetic moment from Higgs fluctuations of its absolute value. It
also allows us to accurately derive the topological Berry phase and relate it

involving higher dimensional control systems. For the standard notion of
coherent control, we identify the information-theoretic resource for
controlling an arbitrary quantum channel on a $d$-dimensional system:
specifically, the resource is an extended quantum channel acting as the
original channel on a $d$-dimensional sector of a $(d+1)$-dimensional system.
Using this resource, arbitrary controlled channels can be built with a
universal circuit architecture. We then extend the standard notion of control
to more general notions, including control of multiple channels with possibly
different input and output systems. Finally, we develop a theoretical
framework, called supermaps on routed channels, which provides a compact
representation of coherent control as an operation performed on the extended
channels, and highlights the way the operation acts on different sectors.

physical order parameter fields, polarization and strain gradients in STEM, or
standing electronic waves and carrier-mediated exchange interactions in STM,
all superimposed onto scanning system distortions and gradual changes of

eye can readily identify certain patterns in the images such as lattice
periodicities, repeating structural elements, or microstructures, their
automatic extraction and classification are highly non-trivial and universal
pathways to accomplish such analyses are absent. We pose that the most
distinctive elements of the patterns observed in STM and (S)TEM images are
similarity and (almost-) periodicity, behaviors stemming directly from the
parsimony of elementary atomic structures, superimposed on the gradual changes

via solution of the \emph{inverse} density functional theory (DFT) problem --
are now available to test the quality of DFT approximations. Herein, the
\emph{exact} XC potential for six molecules -- hydrogen molecule at three
different bond-lengths, lithium hydride, water, and ortho-benzyne -- are
computed using accurate ground-state densities from full configuration
interaction (CI) calculations. These potentials are then compared to model XC
potentials obtained from DFT calculations with commonly used non-local (B3LYP,
HSE06, SCAN0, and M08-HX) and local/semi-local (SCAN, PBE, PW92) XC
functionals. While relative errors in the ground-state densities from these
models are order $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3}-10^{-2})$, much larger errors in the
model XC potentials are found, $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1}-10^0)$, in both the $L_2$
norm of the potential as well as its gradients. These errors are exacerbated in
strongly correlated situations, such as the stretched $\text{H}_2$ molecule.
Among the model XC functionals under consideration, SCAN0 offers the best
quantitative and qualitative agreement with the exact XC potential, underlining
the significance of satisfying the exact conditions as well as the
incorporation of non-local effects in the construction of XC functionals.
Overall, this work indicates that tests against the exact XC potential will
provide a promising new direction for building more accurate XC functionals for
DFT.

excellent avenue for quantum metrology. Practical application, however, is
challenging due to attractive forces leading to stiction and failure of the

Casimir-driven metrology platform, where a time-delay based parametric
amplification technique is developed to achieve a steady state and avoid
pull-in. We apply the design to the detection of weak, low frequency, gradient
magnetic fields, similar to those emanating from ionic currents in the heart

diminished sensitivity in the low frequency regime of biomagnetic fields. Using

create a new image dataset, where each image represents a sentence embedding

models which are pretrained on ImageNet, on the created image dataset for the

very promising, without employing compute resources. Specifically, Sentiment

previous studies that the hadronic decays of these two states receive important
contributions from the intermediate $\bar{K}K^*+c.c.$ meson loops due to the
triangle singularity mechanism, we show that some measurable effects can also
arise from the $\bar{K}K^*+c.c.$ meson loops in their radiative decays. Our
calculation shows that the impact of the $\bar{K}K^*+c.c.$ meson loops on the
$\eta(1405/1475)$ radiative decays is relatively smaller than on $\eta(1295)$
since the latter has a much larger coupling to $\bar{K}K^*+c.c.$ However, the
production of $\eta(1295)$ in the $J/\psi$ radiative decays will be strongly

silence duration in the training and test splits, which tends to correlate with
the target prediction label. Bonafide instances tend to have significantly
longer leading and trailing silences than spoofed instances. In this paper, we
explore this phenomenon and its impact in depth. We compare several types of
models trained on a) only the duration of the leading silence and b) only on
the duration of leading and trailing silence. Results show that models trained
on only the duration of the leading silence perform particularly well, and
achieve up to 85% percent accuracy and an equal error rate (EER) of 15.1%. At
the same time, we observe that trimming silence during pre-processing and then
training established antispoofing models using signal-based features leads to
comparatively worse performance. In that case, EER increases from 3.6% (with
silence) to 15.5% (trimmed silence). Our findings suggest that previous work
may, in part, have inadvertently learned thespoof/bonafide distinction by
relying on the duration of silence as it appears in the official challenge
dataset. We discuss the potential consequences that this has for interpreting
system scores in the challenge and discuss how the ASV community may further
consider this issue.

screening diabetic retinopathy in a multi-center prospective study. To validate
the potential application of THEIA as clinical decision making assistant in a

urban large eye hospital, or a semi-rural optometrist led screening provider,
as they were attending their appointment as part of New Zealand Diabetic
Screening programme. These clinics used a variety of retinal cameras and a
range of operators. The de-identified images were then graded independently by
three senior retinal specialists, and final results were aggregated using New
Zealand grading scheme, which is then converted to referable\non-referable and
Healthy\mild\more than mild\vision threatening categories. Results: compared to
ground truth, THEIA achieved 100% sensitivity and [95.35%-97.44%] specificity,
and negative predictive value of 100%. THEIA also did not miss any patients
with more than mild or vision threatening disease. The level of agreement
between the clinicians and the aggregated results was (k value: 0.9881, 0.9557,
and 0.9175), and the level of agreement between THEIA and the aggregated labels
was (k value: 0.9515). Conclusion: Our multi-centre prospective trial showed
that THEIA does not miss referable disease when screening for diabetic
retinopathy and maculopathy. It also has a very high level of granularity in
reporting the disease level. Since THEIA is being tested on a variety of
cameras, operating in a range of clinics (rural\urban,

and through their generating function, for which an analytical expression is
provided. This function also allows us to get the values of the cumulants at
any order. Such values are useful to obtain the moments at various orders.
Since the cumulants of the distinct subshells are additive this study directly
applies to any relativistic configuration. Recursion relations on the
generating function are given. It is shown that the generating function of the
magnetic quantum number distribution may be expressed as a n-th derivative of a
polynomial. This leads to recurrence relations for this distribution which are
very efficient even in the case of large $j$ or $N$. The magnetic quantum
number distribution is numerically studied using the Gram-Charlier and
Edgeworth expansions. The inclusion of high-order terms may improve the
accuracy of the Gram-Charlier representation for instance when a small and a
large angular momenta coexist in the same configuration. However such series
does not exhibit convergence when high orders are considered and the account
for the first two terms often provides a fair approximation of the magnetic
quantum number distribution. The Edgeworth series offers an interesting
alternative though this expansion is also divergent and of asymptotic nature.

They are particularly
useful for images, as they reduce the number of parameters, reduce training
time, and increase accuracy. However, as a model of the brain they are
seriously problematic, since they require weight sharing - something real
neurons simply cannot do. Consequently, while neurons in the brain can be
locally connected (one of the features of convolutional networks), they cannot
be convolutional. Locally connected but non-convolutional networks, however,
significantly underperform convolutional ones. This is troublesome for studies
that use convolutional networks to explain activity in the visual system. Here
we study plausible alternatives to weight sharing that aim at the same
regularization principle, which is to make each neuron within a pool react
similarly to identical inputs. The most natural way to do that is by showing
the network multiple translations of the same image, akin to saccades in animal
vision. However, this approach requires many translations, and doesn't remove
the performance gap. We propose instead to add lateral connectivity to a
locally connected network, and allow learning via Hebbian plasticity. This
requires the network to pause occasionally for a sleep-like phase of ""weight
sharing"". This method enables locally connected networks to achieve nearly
convolutional performance on ImageNet and improves their fit to the ventral
stream data, thus supporting convolutional networks as a model of the visual
stream.

which are actively discussed by a group of people in a specific local or global

both event time and space is fixed or known beforehand. In this work, we
propose an online spatio-temporal event detection system using social media
that is able to detect events at different time and space resolutions. First,
to address the challenge related to the unknown spatial resolution of events, a
quad-tree method is exploited in order to split the geographical space into
multiscale regions based on the density of social media data. Then, a
statistical unsupervised approach is performed that involves Poisson
distribution and a smoothing method for highlighting regions with unexpected
density of social posts. Further, event duration is precisely estimated by
merging events happening in the same region at consecutive time intervals. A
post processing stage is introduced to filter out events that are spam, fake or
wrong. Finally, we incorporate simple semantics by using social media entities
to assess the integrity, and accuracy of detected events. The proposed method
is evaluated using different social media datasets: Twitter and Flickr for
different cities: Melbourne, London, Paris and New York. To verify the
effectiveness of the proposed method, we compare our results with two baseline
algorithms based on fixed split of geographical space and clustering method.

where large-scale labeled datasets are difficult to obtain. Moreover, adding
the knowledge from newly emergent events requires to build a new model from
scratch or continue to fine-tune the model, which can be challenging,
expensive, and unrealistic for real-world settings. In order to address those
challenges, we propose an end-to-end fake news detection framework named
MetaFEND, which is able to learn quickly to detect fake news on emergent events
with a few verified posts. Specifically, the proposed model integrates
meta-learning and neural process methods together to enjoy the benefits of
these approaches. In particular, a label embedding module and a hard attention
mechanism are proposed to enhance the effectiveness by handling categorical
information and trimming irrelevant posts. Extensive experiments are conducted
on multimedia datasets collected from Twitter and Weibo. The experimental
results show our proposed MetaFEND model can detect fake news on never-seen
events effectively and outperform the state-of-the-art methods.

news feeds are streamingly updated, where each chunk of documents is
incorporated with smoothly evolving yet dependent topics. Such digital texts
have attracted extensive research on dynamic topic modeling to infer hidden
evolving topics and their temporal dependencies. However, most of the existing
approaches focus on single-topic-thread evolution and ignore the fact that a
current topic may be coupled with multiple relevant prior topics. In addition,
these approaches also incur the intractable inference problem when inferring
latent parameters, resulting in a high computational cost and performance
degradation. In this work, we assume that a current topic evolves from all
prior topics with corresponding coupling weights, forming the
multi-topic-thread evolution. Our method models the dependencies between
evolving topics and thoroughly encodes their complex multi-couplings across
time steps. To conquer the intractable inference challenge, a new solution with
a set of novel data augmentation techniques is proposed, which successfully
discomposes the multi-couplings between evolving topics. A fully conjugate
model is thus obtained to guarantee the effectiveness and efficiency of the
inference technique. A novel Gibbs sampler with a backward-forward filter
algorithm efficiently learns latent timeevolving parameters in a closed-form.
In addition, the latent Indian Buffet Process (IBP) compound distribution is
exploited to automatically infer the overall topic number and customize the
sparse topic proportions for each sequential document without bias. The
proposed method is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets against
the competitive baselines, demonstrating its superiority over the baselines in
terms of the low per-word perplexity, high coherent topics, and better document
time prediction.

introduce the Triad Identity Matching (TIM) test and evaluate it using Item
Response Theory (IRT). Participants view face-image ""triads"" (N=225) (two
images of one identity, one image of a different identity) and select the
different identity. In Experiment 1, university students (N=197) showed
wide-ranging accuracy on the TIM test, and IRT modeling demonstrated that the
TIM items span various difficulty levels. In Experiment 2, we used IRT-based

Simulations showed that subsets of the TIM items yielded reliable estimates of

a Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition where all the terms corresponding to the

curl-free term. These transformations are founded on the bases of discrete
mechanics, an alternative approach to the mechanics of continuous media, where
conservation of the acceleration on a segment replaces that of the momentum on
a volume. The equation of motion thus becomes a law of conservation of total
mechanical energy per volume unit where the conservation of mass is no longer
necessarily an additional law. The new formulation of the Navier-Stokes
equations recovers the properties of the discrete approach without altering
those of its initial form; the solutions of the classical form are also those
of the proposed formulation. Writing inertial terms in two components resulting
from the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition gives the equation of motion new

we take a first step towards extending this common practice by calculating
location-specific a-priori lane change probabilities. The idea behind this is
straight forward: The driving behavior of humans may vary in exactly the same
traffic situation depending on the respective location. E.g. drivers may ask
themselves: Should I pass the truck in front of me immediately or should I wait
until reaching the less curvy part of my route lying only a few kilometers
ahead? Although, such information is far away from allowing behavior prediction
on its own, it is obvious that today's approaches will greatly benefit when
incorporating such location-specific a-priori probabilities into their
predictions. For example, our investigations show that highway interchanges
tend to enhance driver's motivation to perform lane changes, whereas curves
seem to have lane change-dampening effects. Nevertheless, the investigation of
all considered local conditions shows that superposition of various effects can
lead to unexpected probabilities at some locations. We thus suggest dynamically
constructing and maintaining a lane change probability map based on customer
fleet data in order to support onboard prediction systems with additional
information. For deriving reliable lane change probabilities a broad customer
fleet is the key to success.

portfolios; that is, an optimal risk-reward portfolio allocation using VaR as
the risk measure. This is due to VaR being non-convex and of combinatorial
nature. In particular, it is well known that the VaR portfolio problem can be
formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) that is difficult to solve
with current MILP solvers for medium to large-scale instances of the problem.
Here, we present an algorithm to compute near-optimal VaR portfolios that takes
advantage of this MILP formulation and provides a guarantee of the solution's
near-optimality. As a byproduct, we obtain an algorithm to compute tight lower

the proposed algorithm is obtained thanks to the relation between minimum risk
portfolios satisfying a reward benchmark and the corresponding maximum reward
portfolios satisfying a risk benchmark. These alternate formulations of the
portfolio allocation problem have been frequently studied in the case of convex
risk measures and concave reward functions. Here, this relationship is
considered for general risk measures and reward functions. To illustrate the

mainly from combustion in car engines. Breathing CO-polluted air can cause
dizziness, fainting, breathing problems, and sometimes death. To prevent health
accidents, including explosions, in open or closed environments, remote and
real-time monitoring of the concentration levels of CO and LPG gases has become
a necessity. The aim of this work is to demonstrate the use of Internet of
Things (IoT) techniques to design and build a telemetry system to monitor in
real-time the concentration of GLP and CO gases in the surrounding air. To
implement this work, as central hardware there is a microcontroller, CO and PLG
sensors on the electronic station. Besides, Amazon Web Services (AWS) was used
as an IoT platform and data storage in the cloud. The main result was a
telematics system to monitor in real time the concentrations of both GLP and CO
gases, whose data is accessible from any device with internet access through a
website. Field tests have been successful and have shown that the proposed
system is an efficient and low-cost option.

based on lens-assisted beam steering (LABS) technology. As a proof-of-concept
demonstration, with a design of subwavelength-gap one-dimensional (1D)
long-emitter array and multi-wavelength flash beam emitting, the device was
measured to have 5%-blind zone suppression, 0.06{\deg}/point-deflection step
and 4.2 microsecond-scanning speed. In time-of-flight (TOF) ranging
experiments, Lidar systems have field of view of 11.3{\deg}* 8.1{\deg} (normal
device) or 0.9{\deg}*8.1{\deg} (blind-zone suppressed device), far-field number
of resolved points of 192 and a detection distance of 10 m. This work
demonstrates the possibility that a new integrated beam-steering technology can
be implemented in a Lidar without sacrificing other performance.

  Phase Shifter","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2107.09157",,,,"physics.app-ph physics.ins-det physics.optics","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Conventional circulators are made of magnetic ferrites and suffer from a
cumbersome architecture, incompatibility with integrated circuit technology and
inability for high frequency applications. To overcome these limitations, here
we propose a lightweight low-profile non-magnetic circulator comprising a
nonreciprocal time-varying phase shifter. This circulator is composing a
nonreciprocal temporal phase shifter and two reciprocal delay-line-based phase
shifters. The proposed nonreciprocal temporal phase shifter is based on the
generation of time-harmonic signals, enforcing destructive interference for
undesired time harmonics and constructive interference for desired time
harmonics at different locations of the structure. Such a unique task is
accomplished through two phase-engineered temporal loops. The phase and
frequency of these two loops are governed by external signals with different
phases, imparting an effective electronic angular momentum to the system. We
observe large isolation level of greater than 32 dB, a P1dB of +31.7 dBm and
IIP3 of +42.4 dBm. Furthermore, this circulator is endowed with a
reconfigurable architecture and can be directly embedded in a conventional
integrated circuit (IC) technology to realize a class of high power handling
and linear IC circulators.

perturbation theory, matrix elements of some of QED physical processes are
calculated. The final results coincide with cross-sections calculated in the
standard QED. The self-energy of an electron and amplitudes of processes
associated with determination of the anomalous magnetic moment of an electron
and Lamb shift are calculated. These results agree with the results in the
standard QED.Distinctive feature of the developed theory is the fact that only
states with positive energies are present in the intermediate virtual states in
the calculations of the electron self-energy, anomalous magnetic moment of an
electron and Lamb shift. Besides, in equations, masses of particle and
anti-particles have the opposite signs.

special, allowing for vast varieties of exotic smoothness (differential)
structures, distinguished by their handlebody decompositions, even as the
coarser algebraic topology is fixed. Should the spacetime we reside in takes up
one of the more exotic choices, and there is no obvious reason why it
shouldn't, apparent pathologies would inevitably plague calculus-based physical
theories assuming the standard vanilla structure, due to the non-existence of a
diffeomorphism and the consequent lack of a suitable portal through which to
transfer the complete information regarding the exotic physical dynamics into
the vanilla theories. An obvious plausible consequence of this deficiency would
be the uncertainty permeating our attempted description of the microscopic
world. We tentatively argue here, that a re-inspection of the key ingredients
of the phenomenological particle models, from the perspective of exotica, could
possibly yield interesting insights. Our short and rudimentary discussion is
qualitative and speculative, consisting merely of conjectures, because the
necessary mathematical tools have only just began to be developed.
