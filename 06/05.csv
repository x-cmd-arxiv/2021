  Time-to-First-Spike Coding",,,,,"cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The tremendous energy consumption of deep neural networks (DNNs) has become a
serious problem in deep learning. Spiking neural networks (SNNs), which mimic
the operations in the human brain, have been studied as prominent
energy-efficient neural networks. Due to their event-driven and
spatiotemporally sparse operations, SNNs show possibilities for
energy-efficient processing. To unlock their potential, deep SNNs have adopted
temporal coding such as time-to-first-spike (TTFS)coding, which represents the
information between neurons by the first spike time. With TTFS coding, each
neuron generates one spike at most, which leads to a significant improvement in
energy efficiency. Several studies have successfully introduced TTFS coding in
deep SNNs, but they showed restricted efficiency improvement owing to the lack
of consideration for efficiency during training. To address the aforementioned
issue, this paper presents training methods for energy-efficient deep SNNs with
TTFS coding. We introduce a surrogate DNN model to train the deep SNN in a
feasible time and analyze the effect of the temporal kernel on training
performance and efficiency. Based on the investigation, we propose
stochastically relaxed activation and initial value-based regularization for
the temporal kernel parameters. In addition, to reduce the number of spikes
even further, we present temporal kernel-aware batch normalization. With the
proposed methods, we could achieve comparable training results with
significantly reduced spikes, which could lead to energy-efficient deep SNNs.

  Equipped with this toolbox of algorithms and lower bounds, we consider
various inclusion problems for regular forest languages under substitutions.
The substitutions in this paper replace leaf variables by forest languages.
Depending on the direction of the inclusion, the problem for a given

particular, the equivalence problem under substitutions is complete for
exponential time and, hence, more difficult than the equivalence problem for
forest languages without substitutions. If we ask whether there exists a

complete for NP or exponential time, depending on whether we consider inclusion

internal wavefield. The resulting formula is remarkably similar to the renowned
phenomenological formula for the turbulent dissipation rate in the ocean which
is known as the Finescale Parameterization. The prediction is based on the wave
turbulence theory of internal gravity waves and on a new methodology devised
for the computation of the associated energy fluxes. In the standard spectral
representation of the wave energy density, in the two-dimensional vertical
wavenumber - frequency domain, the energy fluxes associated with the steady
state are found to be directed downscale in both coordinates, closely matching
the Finescale-Parameterization formula in functional form and in magnitude.
These energy transfers are composed of a `local' and a `scale-separated'
contributions; while the former is quantified numerically, the latter is
dominated by the Induced Diffusion process and is amenable to analytical
treatment. Contrary to previous results indicating an inverse energy cascade
from high frequency to low, at odds with observations, our analysis of all
non-zero coefficients of the diffusion tensor predicts a direct energy cascade.
Moreover, by the same analysis fundamental spectra that had been deemed
`no-flux' solutions are reinstated to the status of `constant-downscale-flux'
solutions. This is consequential for an understanding of energy fluxes, sources
and sinks that fits in the observational paradigm of the Finescale
Parameterization, solving at once two long-standing paradoxes that had earned
the name of `Oceanic Ultraviolet Catastrophe'.

amongst the most intensely developed applications of rewriting-based methods in
the life sciences to date. A typical feature of these types of rewriting
theories is the necessity to implement certain structural constraints on the
objects to be rewritten (a protein is empirically found to have a certain
signature of sites, a carbon atom can form at most four bonds, ...). In this
paper, we contribute a number of original developments that permit to implement
a universal theory of continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs) for stochastic
rewriting systems. Our core mathematical concepts are a novel rule algebra
construction for the relevant setting of rewriting rules with conditions, both
in Double- and in Sesqui-Pushout semantics, augmented by a suitable stochastic
mechanics formalism extension that permits to derive dynamical evolution
equations for pattern-counting statistics. A second main contribution of our
paper is a novel framework of restricted rewriting theories, which comprises a
rule-algebra calculus under the restriction to so-called constraint-preserving
completions of application conditions (for rules considered to act only upon
objects of the underlying category satisfying a globally fixed set of
structural constraints). This novel framework in turn renders a faithful
encoding of bio- and organo-chemical rewriting in the sense of Kappa and M{\O}D
possible, which allows us to derive a rewriting-based formulation of reaction
systems including a full-fledged CTMC semantics as instances of our universal
CTMC framework. While offering an interesting new perspective and conceptual
simplification of this semantics in the setting of Kappa, both the formal
encoding and the CTMC semantics of organo-chemical reaction systems as
motivated by the M{\O}D framework are the first such results of their kind.

large number of parameters in a non-linear fashion. Suitable parameters of
these are found by minimizing a 'loss functional', typically by stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) or an advanced SGD-based algorithm.
  In a continuous time model for SGD with noise that follows the 'machine

algorithm prefers 'flat' minima of the objective function in a sense which is
different from the flat minimum selection of continuous time SGD with

in which covariate data can be naturally partitioned into clusters, ensembling
algorithms based on suitably aggregating models trained on individual clusters
often perform substantially better than methods that ignore the clustering
structure in the data. In this paper, we provide theoretical support to these
empirical observations by asymptotically analyzing linear least squares and
random forest regressions under a linear model. Our main results demonstrate
that the benefit of ensembling compared to training a single model on the
entire data, often termed 'merging', might depend on the underlying bias and
variance interplay of the individual predictors to be aggregated. In
particular, under both fixed and high dimensional linear models, we show that
merging is asymptotically superior to optimal ensembling techniques for linear
least squares regression due to the unbiased nature of least squares
prediction. In contrast, for random forest regression under fixed dimensional
linear models, our bounds imply a strict benefit of ensembling over merging.
Finally, we also present numerical experiments to verify the validity of our
asymptotic results across different situations.

covariates have an underlying spatial organization reflected in their
correlation. A typical example of such a setting is high-resolution imaging, in
which neighboring pixels are usually very similar. Accurate point and
confidence intervals estimation is not possible in this context with many more
covariates than samples, furthermore with high correlation between covariates.
This calls for a reformulation of the statistical inference problem, that takes
into account the underlying spatial structure: if covariates are locally
correlated, it is acceptable to detect them up to a given spatial uncertainty.
We thus propose to rely on the $\delta$-FWER, that is the probability of making
a false discovery at a distance greater than $\delta$ from any true positive.
With this target measure in mind, we study the properties of ensembled
clustered inference algorithms which combine three techniques: spatially
constrained clustering, statistical inference, and ensembling to aggregate
several clustered inference solutions. We show that ensembled clustered
inference algorithms control the $\delta$-FWER under standard assumptions for
$\delta$ equal to the largest cluster diameter. We complement the theoretical
analysis with empirical results, demonstrating accurate $\delta$-FWER control
and decent power achieved by such inference algorithms.

self-supervised learning from traditional representation learning, which works

categories. Many stereotypes are overtly negative, while others may appear
positive on the surface, but still lead to negative consequences. In this work,
we present a computational approach to interpreting stereotypes in text through
the Stereotype Content Model (SCM), a comprehensive causal theory from social
psychology. The SCM proposes that stereotypes can be understood along two
primary dimensions: warmth and competence. We present a method for defining
warmth and competence axes in semantic embedding space, and show that the four
quadrants defined by this subspace accurately represent the warmth and
competence concepts, according to annotated lexicons. We then apply our
computational SCM model to textual stereotype data and show that it compares
favourably with survey-based studies in the psychological literature.
Furthermore, we explore various strategies to counter stereotypical beliefs
with anti-stereotypes. It is known that countering stereotypes with
anti-stereotypical examples is one of the most effective ways to reduce biased
thinking, yet the problem of generating anti-stereotypes has not been
previously studied. Thus, a better understanding of how to generate realistic
and effective anti-stereotypes can contribute to addressing pressing societal
concerns of stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination.

sidewalks, and the occurrence of obstacles. The forecasts are generated in
grids discretizing the space and in the form of arbitrary discrete probability
distributions. The distributions are evaluated in terms of their reliability,
sharpness, and positional accuracy. We compare our method with an approach that
provides forecasts in the form of Gaussian distributions and discuss the
respective advantages and disadvantages. Thereby, we investigate the impact of
using poses and semantic maps. With a technique called spatial label smoothing,
our approach achieves reliable forecasts. Overall, the poses have a positive
impact on the forecasts. The semantic maps offer the opportunity to adapt the
probability distributions to the individual situation, although at the

the past movements of the VRU. Our method is evaluated on a dataset recorded in

apparent resolution in the perpendicular plane to produce multi-planar
reformats or 3D images is commonly used. Single image super-resolution (SR) is
a promising technique to provide HR images based on unsupervised learning to
increase resolution of a 2D image, but there are few reports on 3D SR. Further,
perceptual loss is proposed in the literature to better capture the textual
details and edges than using pixel-wise loss functions, by comparing the
semantic distances in the high-dimensional feature space of a pre-trained 2D
network (e.g., VGG). However, it is not clear how one should generalize it to
3D medical images, and the attendant implications are still unclear. In this
paper, we propose a framework called SOUP-GAN: Super-resolution Optimized Using

thinner slice (e.g., high resolution in the 'Z' plane) medical images with
anti-aliasing and deblurring. The proposed method outperforms other

of the impact of the $^{18}$F(p,$\alpha$) reaction in classical novae to date.
The $^{18}$F(p,$\alpha$) rate remains highly uncertain at nova temperatures,
resulting in a factor ~10 uncertainty in the predicted abundance of $^{18}$F
ejected from nova explosions. We also found that the abundance of $^{18}$F may
be strongly correlated with that of $^{19}$F. Conclusions. Despite numerous
nuclear physics uncertainties affecting the $^{18}$F(p,$\alpha$) reaction rate,
which are dominated by unknown interference signs between 1/2$^+$ and 3/2$^+$
resonances, future experimental work should focus on firmly and precisely
determining the directly measurable quantum properties of the subthreshold
states in the compound nucleus $^{19}$Ne near 6.13 and 6.29 MeV.

that further intramolecular energy transfer via anharmonic vibrations is

regularize the Q-value estimation and stabilize training by using an additional
set of lagging parameters. Despite their advantages, target networks are
potentially an inflexible way to regularize Q-values which may ultimately slow
down training. In this work, we address this issue by augmenting the squared
Bellman error with a functional regularizer. Unlike target networks, the
regularization we propose here is explicit and enables us to use up-to-date

more stable training method. We analyze the convergence of our method

this distribution efficiently, both in sample and time complexities. We also
provide empirical evidence that our assumption ""forward super-resolution"" is
very natural in practice, and the underlying learning mechanisms that we study
in this paper (to allow us efficiently train GAN via SGDA in theory) simulates
the actual learning process of GANs on real-world problems.

STC, i.e., one round of local parity-check measurements suffices to perform
reliable QEC even in the presence of measurement errors. We also propose an
efficient single-shot QEC strategy for the 3D STC and investigate its
performance. In particular, we numerically estimate the resulting storage
threshold against independent bit-flip, phase-flip and measurement errors to be
$p_\text{STC} \approx 1.045\%$. Such a high threshold together with local

the sub-networks become functionally entangled. Defining functional
specialization is in itself a challenging problem without a universally agreed

them to qualitatively agree. Our results have implications in both neuroscience

there is functional modularity simply by observing moderate levels of

verification. Meanwhile, although Constrained Horn Clauses (CHCs) empower a
wide range of verification techniques and tools, they lack the ability to
express hyperproperties beyond $k$-safety such as generalized non-interference
and co-termination.
  This paper describes a novel and fully automated constraint-based approach to
relational verification. We first introduce a new class of predicate Constraint
Satisfaction Problems called pfwCSP where constraints are represented as
clauses modulo first-order theories over predicate variables of three kinds:
ordinary, well-founded, or functional. This generalization over CHCs permits
arbitrary (i.e., possibly non-Horn) clauses, well-foundedness constraints,
functionality constraints, and is capable of expressing these relational
verification problems. Our approach enables us to express and automatically
verify problem instances that require non-trivial (i.e., non-sequential and
non-lock-step) self-composition by automatically inferring appropriate
schedulers (or alignment) that dictate when and which program copies move. To
solve problems in this new language, we present a constraint solving method for
pfwCSP based on stratified CounterExample-Guided Inductive Synthesis (CEGIS) of
ordinary, well-founded, and functional predicates.
  We have implemented the proposed framework and obtained promising results on

the equation for the quasi-isotropic particle momentum distribution. The
consequent multi-band non-thermal emission is from two different regions,
namely the acceleration region and the escaping region. Our model is capable of
explaining the multi-band photon emission via the dominant synchrotron
radiation of the electrons accelerated inside the SNR; and the photons with
energy of $\gtrsim$ GeV are naturally produced by the protons inside and
outside the SNR. Moreover, the photons in the energy range of $\sim 1 - \sim
100$ TeV are due to the interaction of escaped protons with dense molecular
clouds. For the photons with energy of $E_\gamma \gtrsim $ 1 GeV from SNR
G106.3+2.7, our results here favor a hadronic origin, where the photons in the

representation, Light Field Networks or LFNs, which represent both geometry and
appearance of the underlying 3D scene in a 360-degree, four-dimensional light

leverage meta-learning to learn a prior over LFNs that enables multi-view
consistent light field reconstruction from as little as a single image
observation. This results in dramatic reductions in time and memory complexity,
and enables real-time rendering. The cost of storing a 360-degree light field
via an LFN is two orders of magnitude lower than conventional methods such as
the Lumigraph. Utilizing the analytical differentiability of neural implicit

demonstrate the extraction of sparse depth maps from LFNs.

that Kitaev materials with bond-anisotropic interactions are generally expected

to obtain the correct leading contributions to the Raman vertex operator
$\mc{R}$, one must take into account the precise, photon-assisted microscopic
hopping processes of the electrons and that, in systems with multiple hopping
paths, $\mc{R}$ contains terms beyond those appearing in the traditional
Loudon-Fleury theory. Most saliently, a numerical implementation of the revised
formalism to the case of the three-dimensional hyperhoneycomb Kitaev material
$\beta$-Li$_2$IrO$_3$ reveals that the non-Loudon-Fleury scattering terms
actually dominate the Raman intensity. In addition, they induce a qualitative
modification of the polarization dependence, including, e.g., the emergence of
a sharp one-magnon peak at low energies which is not expected in the
traditional Loudon-Fleury theory. This peak is shown to arise from microscopic
photon-assisted tunneling processes that are of similar type with the ones
leading to the symmetric off-diagonal interaction $\Gamma$ (known to be present
in many Kitaev materials), but take the form of a bond-directional magnetic
dipole term in the Raman vertex. These results are expected to apply across all

With an angular resolution $\times25$ better than FIRST, we resolve structures
within the host galaxies of these QSOs ($> 2$ kpc). We report a statistically
significant difference in the incidence of extended kpc-scale emission in red
QSOs. From an analysis of the radio size distributions of the sample, we find
that the excess radio emission in red QSOs can be attributed to structures that
are confined to galaxy scales ($< 10$ kpc), while we confirm previous results
that red and normal QSOs have similar incidences of radio jets and lobes on
circumgalactic or larger scales ($> 10$ kpc). Our results indicate that the
primary mechanism that generates the enhanced radio emission in red QSOs is not
directly connected with the nuclear engine or accretion disc, but is likely to
arise from extended components such as AGN-driven jets or winds.

challenges in a practical implementation of quantum circuits. One major
technique that can overcome this problem is the flag technique, in which
high-weight errors arising from a few faults can be detected by a few ancillas
and distinguished using subsequent syndrome measurements. The technique can be
further improved using the fact that for some families of codes, errors of any
weight are logically equivalent if they have the same syndrome and weight
parity, as previously shown in [Phys. Rev. A 104, 042410 (2021)]. In this work,
we develop a notion of distinguishable fault set which captures both concepts
of flags and weight parities, and extend the use of weight parities in error
correction from [Phys. Rev. A 104, 042410 (2021)] to families of capped and
recursive capped color codes. We also develop fault-tolerant protocols for
error correction, measurement, state preparation, and logical T gate
implementation via code switching, which are sufficient for performing
fault-tolerant Clifford computation on a capped color code, and performing
fault-tolerant universal quantum computation on a recursive capped color code.
Our protocols for a capped or a recursive capped color code of any distance
require only 2 ancillas, assuming that the ancillas can be reused. The concept
of distinguishable fault set also leads to a generalization of the definitions
of fault-tolerant gadgets proposed by Aliferis, Gottesman, and Preskill.

core-collapse supernova (CCSN): the explosion mechanism, neutrino signals, and
nucleosynthesis in the ejecta. This particular mode of collective neutrino
oscillations has a deep connection to the angular structure of neutrinos in
momentum space; for instance, the appearance of electron neutrinos lepton
number (ELN) angular crossings in momentum space is a good indicator of
occurrences of the flavor conversions. However, many multi-dimensional
(multi-D) CCSN simulations are carried out with approximate neutrino transport
(such as two-moment methods), which limits the access to the angular
distributions of neutrinos, i.e., inhibits ELN-crossing searches. In this
paper, we develop a new method of ELN-crossing search in these CCSN
simulations. The required data is the zero-th and first angular moments of
neutrinos and matter profile, all of which are available in CCSN models with
two-moment method. One of the novelties of our new method is to use a
ray-tracing neutrino transport to determine ELNs in the direction of the
stellar center. It is designed to compensate for shortcomings of the crossing
searches only with the two angular moments. We assess the capability of the
method by carrying out a detailed comparison to results of full Boltzmann
neutrino transport in 1D and 2D CCSN models. We find that the ray-tracing
neutrino transport improves the accuracy of crossing searches; indeed, the
appearance/disappearance of the crossings is accurately detected even in the
region of forward-peaked angular distributions. The new method is
computationally cheap and has a benefit of efficient parallelization; hence, it
will be useful for ELN-crossing searches in any CCSN models employed two-moment
neutrino transport.

of galaxies without the need of performing their spectroscopic follow-up. In
this work, we forward-model the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey
(PAUS) narrow-band data. The aim is to improve the constraints on the spectral
coefficients used to create the galaxy spectral energy distributions (SED) of
the galaxy population model in Tortorelli et al. 2020. In that work, the model
parameters were inferred from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey
(CFHTLS) data using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). This led to
stringent constraints on the B-band galaxy luminosity function parameters, but
left the spectral coefficients only broadly constrained. To address that, we
perform an ABC inference using CFHTLS and PAUS data. This is the first time our
approach combining forward-modelling and ABC is applied simultaneously to
multiple datasets. We test the results of the ABC inference by comparing the
narrow-band magnitudes of the observed and simulated galaxies using Principal
Component Analysis, finding a very good agreement. Furthermore, we prove the
scientific potential of the constrained galaxy population model to provide
realistic stellar population properties by measuring them with the SED fitting
code \textsc{CIGALE}. We use CFHTLS broad-band and PAUS narrow-band photometry
for a flux-limited ($\mathrm{i}<22.5$) sample of galaxies up to redshift
$\mathrm{z \sim 0.8}$. We find that properties like stellar masses,
star-formation rates, mass-weighted stellar ages and metallicities are in
agreement within errors between observations and simulations. Overall, this
work shows the ability of our galaxy population model to correctly
forward-model a complex dataset such as PAUS and the ability to reproduce the
diversity of galaxy properties at the redshift range spanned by CFHTLS and
PAUS.

and economically efficient manner. In this context, the Nash social
welfare-defined as the geometric mean of agents' valuations for their assigned
bundles-stands as a fundamental measure that quantifies the extent of fairness
of an allocation. Focusing on instances in which the agents' valuations have
binary marginals, we develop essentially tight results for (approximately)
maximizing Nash social welfare under two of the most general classes of
complement-free valuations, i.e., under binary XOS and binary subadditive
valuations.
  For binary XOS valuations, we develop a polynomial-time algorithm that finds
a constant-factor (specifically $288$) approximation for the optimal Nash
social welfare, in the standard value-oracle model. The allocations computed by
our algorithm also achieve constant-factor approximation for social welfare and
the groupwise maximin share guarantee. These results imply that-in the case of
binary XOS valuations-there necessarily exists an allocation that
simultaneously satisfies multiple (approximate) fairness and efficiency
criteria. We complement the algorithmic result by proving that Nash social
welfare maximization is APX-hard under binary XOS valuations.
  Furthermore, this work establishes an interesting separation between the
binary XOS and binary subadditive settings. In particular, we prove that an
exponential number of value queries are necessarily required to obtain even a
sub-linear approximation for Nash social welfare under binary subadditive
valuations.

protoplanetary discs with misaligned inner discs and warps that may be caused
by such interactions with a previously undetected companion, giving us a
tantalising indication of possible planets forming there. Hydrodynamical and
radiative transfer models indicate that the temperature varies azimuthally in
warped discs due to the variable angle at which the disc surface faces the star

hydrodynamical model of a protoplanetary disc with an embedded planet orbiting
at a 12$^{\circ}$ inclination to the disc. Even for this small misalignment,
abundances of species including CO and HCO$^+$ vary azimuthally and this
results in detectable azimuthal variations in submillimetre line emission.
Azimuthal variations in line emission may therefore indicate the presence of an
unseen embedded companion. Nonaxisymmetric chemical abundances should be

The dense electron current generates a magnetic filament with field strength of

electrons radially, enabling efficient acceleration and conversion of laser
energy into MeV photons by electron oscillations in the filament. The use of
microstructured targets stabilizes the hosing instabilities associated with
relativistically transparent interactions, resulting in robust and repeatable
production of this phenomenon. Analytical scaling laws are derived to describe
the radiated photon spectrum and energy from the magnetic filament phenomenon

Adaptive Optics beacons for ground-based 8-30 meter telescopes, in particular
the 10 meter Keck Telescopes. When built as designed, ORCAS+Keck would deliver

capabilities. We summarize the potential of high-resolution faint galaxy
science with ORCAS. We show that the ability to detect optical-near-IR point
sources with r_e>0.01"" FWHM to AB<31 mag will yield about 5.0x10^6 faint
star-forming (SF) clumps per square degree, or ~0.4 per arcsec^2. From recent
HST lensing data, the typical intrinsic (unlensed) sizes of SF clumps at z~1-7
will be r_e ~1-80 m.a.s. to AB<31 mag, with intrinsic (unmagnified) fluxes as
faint as AB<35-36 mag when searching with ORCAS around the critical curves of
lensing clusters imaged with HST and JWST. About half of these SF clumps will
have sizes below the ORCAS diffraction limit, and the other half will be
slightly resolved, but still mostly above the ORCAS surface brightness (SB)
limits. ORCAS will address how galaxies assemble from smaller clumps to stable
disks by measuring ages, metallicities, and gradients of clumps within
galaxies. ORCAS can monitor caustic transits of individual stars in SF clumps
at z>1-2 that have been detected with HST, and those that may be detected with
JWST at z>6 at extreme magnifications (mu>10^3-10^5) for the first stars and
their stellar mass black hole accretion disks. ORCAS provides a unique
opportunity to obtain a statistical census of individual stars at cosmological

with odds ratios in clinical research. We disagreed, and empirically documented
the lack of portability of odds ratios, while Doi et al. defended their
position. In this response we highlight important errors in their position.
  Study Design and Setting: We counter Doi et al.'s arguments by further
examining the correlations of odds ratios, and risk ratios, with baseline risks
in 20,198 meta-analyses from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.
  Results: Doi et al.'s claim that odds ratios are portable is invalid because
1) their reasoning is circular: they assume a model under which the odds ratio
is constant and show that under such a model the odds ratio is portable; 2) the
method they advocate to convert odds ratios to risk ratios is biased; 3) their
empirical example is readily-refuted by counter-examples of meta-analyses in
which the risk ratio is portable but the odds ratio isn't; and 4) they fail to
consider the causal determinants of meta-analytic inclusion criteria: Doi et
al. mistakenly claim that variation in odds ratios with different baseline
risks in meta-analyses is due to collider bias. Empirical comparison between
the correlations of odds ratios, and risk ratios, with baseline risks show that
the portability of odds ratios and risk ratios varies across settings.
  Conclusion: The suggestion to replace risk ratios with odds ratios is based
on circular reasoning and a confusion of mathematical and empirical results. It
is especially misleading for meta-analyses and clinical guidance. Neither the
odds ratio nor the risk ratio is universally portable. To address this lack of
portability, we reinforce our suggestion to report variation in effect measures
conditioning on modifying factors such as baseline risk; understanding such
variation is essential to patient-centered practice.

ultra-reliable target number of uplink critical data transmission within a
latency constraint by jointly optimizing the relay selection, resource block
(RB) assignment, and transmit power allocation. Such protocol design is
formulated as a mixed-integer and strictly non-convex problem where
optimization variables are mutual coupling, which is definitely challenging.
Instead of conventional methods designed for solving the problem, we leverage
the properties of the relative entropy function to equivalently transform the
problem without introducing extra constraints. As the packet error probability
requirements of each robot under two possible transmission modes are coupled in
one overall reliability constraint, the big-M technique is applied to decouple
it into two corresponding reliability constraints. One is for direct
transmission mode, and the other is for cooperative transmission mode.
Moreover, both non-convex penalty (NCP) and quadratic penalty (QP) approaches
are utilized to deal with the binary indicator constraints. Based on such
penalty methods, a sequence of penalized approximated convex problems can be
iteratively solved for sub-optimal solutions. Numerical results demonstrate the
efficiency of such two penalty methods from the perspectives of sub-optimal
values of total transmit power and convergence rate. Further, the impacts of
reliability, the number and location of relays, the number of robots, the
target number of data bits on the total power consumption are analyzed.

recover a function on the sphere from noisy, randomly rotated copies of it. We
assume that the function is a linear combination of low-degree spherical
harmonics. This is a natural abstraction for the problem of recovering the
three-dimensional structure of a molecule through cryo-electron tomography. For
provably learning the parameters of a generative model, the method of moments
is the standard workhorse of theoretical machine learning. It turns out that
there is a natural incarnation of the method of moments for orbit recovery
based on invariant theory. Bandeira et al. [BBSK+18] used invariant theory to
give tight bounds on the sample complexity in terms of the noise level. However
many of the key challenges remain: Can we prove bounds on the sample complexity
that are polynomial in $n$, the dimension of the signal? The bounds in
[BBSK+18] hide constants that have an unspecified dependence on $n$ and only
hold in the limit as $\sigma^2 \rightarrow \infty$ where $\sigma^2$ is the
variance of the noise. Moreover can we give efficient algorithms? We revisit
these challenges from the perspective of smoothed analysis, where we assume
that the coefficients of the signal, in the basis of spherical harmonics, are
subject to small random perturbations. Our main result is a quasi-polynomial
time algorithm for orbit recovery over $SO(3)$ in this model. Our approach is
based on frequency marching, which sequentially solves linear systems to find
higher degree coefficients. Our main technical contribution is to show that
these linear systems have unique solutions, are well-conditioned, and that the
error can be made to compound over at most a logarithmic number of rounds. We
believe that our work takes an important first step towards uncovering the
algorithmic implications of invariant theory.

devices focusing on three demonstrative platforms: resistive switching
memories, graphene nanogaps and single-molecule nanowires. The functionality of
such ultrasmall devices is confined to an extremely small volume, where bulk
considerations on the noise loose their validity: the relative contribution of
a fluctuator heavily depends on its distance from the device bottleneck, and
the noise characteristics are sensitive to the nanometer-scale device geometry
and the details of the mostly non-classical transport mechanism. All these are
reflected by a highly system-specific dependence of the noise properties on the
active device volume (and the related device resitance), the frequency, or the
applied voltage. Accordingly, 1/f-type noise measurements serve as a rich
fingerprint of the relevant transport and noise-generating mechanisms in the
studied nanoelectronic systems. Finally, we demonstrate that not only the
fundamental understanding and the targeted noise suppression is fueled by the
1/f-type noise analysis, but novel probabilistic computing hardware platforms
heavily seek well tailorable nanoelectric noise sources.

achieving comparable results to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on image
classification. However, vanilla ViT simply inherits the same architecture from
the natural language processing directly, which is often not optimized for
vision applications. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a new
architecture that adopts the pyramid structure and employ a novel
regional-to-local attention rather than global self-attention in vision
transformers. More specifically, our model first generates regional tokens and
local tokens from an image with different patch sizes, where each regional
token is associated with a set of local tokens based on the spatial location.
The regional-to-local attention includes two steps: first, the regional
self-attention extract global information among all regional tokens and then
the local self-attention exchanges the information among one regional token and
the associated local tokens via self-attention. Therefore, even though local
self-attention confines the scope in a local region but it can still receive
global information. Extensive experiments on four vision tasks, including image
classification, object and keypoint detection, semantics segmentation and
action recognition, show that our approach outperforms or is on par with
state-of-the-art ViT variants including many concurrent works. Our source codes

not clear a priori what kind of magnetic field is responsible for the
suppression of the secondary gamma-ray flux: a cosmological magnetic field that
might be filling the voids or the field spread by galactic winds driven by star
formation and active galactic nuclei. We used IllustrisTNG cosmological
simulations to study the effect of magnetized galactic wind bubbles on the
secondary gamma-ray flux. We show that within the IllustrisTNG model of
baryonic feedback, the galactic wind bubbles typically provide
energy-independent secondary flux suppression at the level of about 10%. The
observed flux suppression effect has to be due to the cosmological magnetic
field in the voids. This might not be the case for a special case when the

classify very large images with tiny informative objects. Specifically, these
classification tasks face two key challenges: $i$) the size of the input image
is usually in the order of mega- or giga-pixels, however, existing deep
architectures do not easily operate on such big images due to memory
constraints, consequently, we seek a memory-efficient method to process these
images; and $ii$) only a very small fraction of the input images are

applications, these models operate at extreme scales, where every bit of
performance is critical. Memory constraints at extreme scales also require that
models be sparse, hence tree-based models are often back-ended by sparse matrix
algebra routines. However, there are currently no sparse matrix techniques
specifically designed for the sparsity structure one encounters in tree-based
models for extreme multi-label ranking/classification (XMR/XMC) problems. To
address this issue, we present the masked sparse chunk multiplication (MSCM)
technique, a sparse matrix technique specifically tailored to XMR trees. MSCM
is easy to implement, embarrassingly parallelizable, and offers a significant
performance boost to any existing tree inference pipeline at no cost. We
perform a comprehensive study of MSCM applied to several different sparse
inference schemes and benchmark our methods on a general purpose extreme
multi-label ranking framework. We observe that MSCM gives consistently dramatic
speedups across both the online and batch inference settings, single- and
multi-threaded settings, and on many different tree models and datasets. To
demonstrate its utility in industrial applications, we apply MSCM to an
enterprise-scale semantic product search problem with 100 million products and
achieve sub-millisecond latency of 0.88 ms per query on a single thread -- an
8x reduction in latency over vanilla inference techniques. The MSCM technique
requires absolutely no sacrifices to model accuracy as it gives exactly the
same results as standard sparse matrix techniques. Therefore, we believe that
MSCM will enable users of XMR trees to save a substantial amount of compute
resources in their inference pipelines at very little cost.

instance, female workers at Uber earn less than their male colleagues per mile
driven. Similar observations have been made for other minority subgroups in
other two-sided markets. Here, we suggest a novel market-clearing mechanism for
two-sided markets, which promotes equalisation of the pay per hour worked
across multiple subgroups, as well as within each subgroup. In the process, we
introduce a novel notion of subgroup fairness (which we call Inter-fairness),
which can be combined with other notions of fairness within each subgroup
(called Intra-fairness), and the utility for the customers (Customer-Care) in
the objective of the market-clearing problem. While the novel non-linear terms
in the objective complicate market clearing by making the problem non-convex,
we show that a certain non-convex augmented Lagrangian relaxation can be
approximated to any precision in time polynomial in the number of market
participants using semi-definite programming. This makes it possible to
implement the market-clearing mechanism efficiently. On the example of
driver-ride assignment in an Uber-like system, we demonstrate the efficacy and
scalability of the approach, and trade-offs between Inter- and Intra-fairness.

applications, it is becoming increasingly important for practitioners to
understand the fairness implications associated with those models. Most
existing fairness literature focuses on learning a single task more fairly,
while how ML fairness interacts with multiple tasks in the joint learning
setting is largely under-explored. In this paper, we are concerned with how
group fairness (e.g., equal opportunity, equalized odds) as an ML fairness
concept plays out in the multi-task scenario. In multi-task learning, several
tasks are learned jointly to exploit task correlations for a more efficient
inductive transfer. This presents a multi-dimensional Pareto frontier on (1)
the trade-off between group fairness and accuracy with respect to each task, as
well as (2) the trade-offs across multiple tasks. We aim to provide a deeper
understanding on how group fairness interacts with accuracy in multi-task
learning, and we show that traditional approaches that mainly focus on
optimizing the Pareto frontier of multi-task accuracy might not perform well on
fairness goals. We propose a new set of metrics to better capture the
multi-dimensional Pareto frontier of fairness-accuracy trade-offs uniquely
presented in a multi-task learning setting. We further propose a
Multi-Task-Aware Fairness (MTA-F) approach to improve fairness in multi-task

typical application of SP is choosing locations for a series of marketing

Secondly, the sets are diverse, composed by a mixture of influential and

ranking influence measures in the SP problem based on node sampling and on a
novel statistical method, the Sum of Ranking Differences. Using a Linear

Specifically, this paper models interaction between the crowdsourcing

the spin gap with Ir substitution. Magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and
muon spin relaxation measurements demonstrate that the system undergoes
long-range antiferromagnetic order below a N\'eel temperature,

technical design. The typical starting point in these designs is 2D sketches
which can later be extruded and combined to obtain complex three-dimensional
assemblies. Such sketches are typically composed of parametric primitives, such
as points, lines, and circular arcs, augmented with geometric constraints
linking the primitives, such as coincidence, parallelism, or orthogonality.
Sketches can be represented as graphs, with the primitives as nodes and the
constraints as edges. Training a model to automatically generate CAD sketches
can enable several novel workflows, but is challenging due to the complexity of
the graphs and the heterogeneity of the primitives and constraints. In
particular, each type of primitive and constraint may require a record of
different size and parameter types. We propose SketchGen as a generative model
based on a transformer architecture to address the heterogeneity problem by
carefully designing a sequential language for the primitives and constraints
that allows distinguishing between different primitive or constraint types and
their parameters, while encouraging our model to re-use information across
related parameters, encoding shared structure. A particular highlight of our
work is the ability to produce primitives linked via constraints that enables
the final output to be further regularized via a constraint solver. We evaluate
our model by demonstrating constraint prediction for given sets of primitives
and full sketch generation from scratch, showing that our approach
significantly out performs the state-of-the-art in CAD sketch generation.

for intervening modeling of any type, be it modeling of a material law or
modeling of a prior distribution of material states. We specifically consider
physical systems with states characterized by points in a phase space
determined by the governing field equations. We assume that the system is
characterized by two likelihood measures: one $\mu_D$ measuring the likelihood
of observing a material state in phase space; and another $\mu_E$ measuring the
likelihood of states satisfying the field equations, possibly under random
actuation. We introduce a notion of intersection between measures which can be
interpreted to quantify the likelihood of system outcomes. We provide
conditions under which the intersection can be characterized as the athermal
limit $\mu_\infty$ of entropic regularizations $\mu_\beta$, or thermalizations,
of the product measure $\mu = \mu_D\times \mu_E$ as $\beta \to +\infty$. We
also supply conditions under which $\mu_\infty$ can be obtained as the athermal

sets $(\mu_h)$ approximating weakly an unknown likelihood function $\mu$. In
particular, we find that the cooling sequence $\beta_h \to +\infty$ must be
slow enough, corresponding to quenching, in order for the proper limit

for expectations $\mathbb{E}[f]$ of outcomes $f$ that are explicit in the data,
thus demonstrating the feasibility of the model-free data-driven paradigm as

vulnerable against man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, where an active adversary,
Mallory, can influence and infer part of the secret key generated between Alice
and Bob by injecting her own packet upon observing highly correlated
channel/RSS measurements from Alice and Bob. As all the channels remain stable
within the channel coherence time, Mallory's injected packets cause Alice and
Bob to measure similar RSS, which allows Mallory to successfully predict the
derived key bits. To defend against such a MitM attack, we propose to utilize a
reconfigurable antenna at one of the legitimate transceivers to proactively
randomize the channel state across different channel probing rounds. The
randomization of the antenna mode at every probing round breaks the temporal
correlation of the channels from the adversary to the legitimate devices, while
preserving the reciprocity of the channel between the latter. This prevents key
injection from the adversary without affecting Alice and Bob's ability to
measure common randomness. We theoretically analyze the security of the
protocol and conduct extensive simulations and real-world experiments to
evaluate its performance. Our results show that our approach eliminates the
advantage of an active MitM attack by driving down the probability of
successfully guessing bits of the secret key to a random guess.

learning algorithms by observing solely the output labels, are a type of severe
adversarial attacks against Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) requiring minimal
knowledge of attackers. State-of-the-art DBA attacks relying on zeroth-order
gradient estimation require an excessive number of queries. Recently, Bayesian
optimization (BO) has shown promising in reducing the number of queries in
score-based attacks (SBA), in which attackers need to observe real-valued
probability scores as outputs. However, extending BO to the setting of DBA is
nontrivial because in DBA only output labels instead of real-valued scores, as
needed by BO, are available to attackers. In this paper, we close this gap by
proposing an efficient DBA attack, namely BO-DBA. Different from existing
approaches, BO-DBA generates adversarial examples by searching so-called
\emph{directions of perturbations}. It then formulates the problem as a BO
problem that minimizes the real-valued distortion of perturbations. With the
optimized perturbation generation process, BO-DBA converges much faster than
the state-of-the-art DBA techniques. Experimental results on pre-trained
ImageNet classifiers show that BO-DBA converges within 200 queries while the
state-of-the-art DBA techniques need over 15,000 queries to achieve the same
level of perturbation distortion. BO-DBA also shows similar attack success
rates even as compared to BO-based SBA attacks but with less distortion.

nonparametric inference of {the} interaction function with pointwise
uncertainty quantification, and the other one is the inference of unknown
scalar parameters in the non-collective friction forces of the system. We
formulate the learning problem as a statistical inverse problem and provide a
detailed analysis of recoverability conditions, establishing that a coercivity
condition is sufficient for recoverability. Given data collected from $M$ i.i.d
trajectories with independent Gaussian observational noise, we provide a
finite-sample analysis, showing that our posterior mean estimator converges in
a Reproducing kernel Hilbert space norm, at an optimal rate in $M$ equal to the
one in the classical 1-dimensional Kernel Ridge regression. As a byproduct, we
show we can obtain a parametric learning rate in $M$ for the posterior marginal
variance using $L^{\infty}$ norm, and the rate could also involve $N$ and $L$
(the number of observation time instances for each trajectory), depending on
the condition number of the inverse problem. Numerical results on systems that
exhibit different swarming behaviors demonstrate efficient learning of our

objects in cluttered scenes without the kind of context information usually
present in human-centric datasets. This challenging computer vision task
currently lacks suitable datasets or methods in the available literature. In
this paper, we take a step towards computer-aided waste detection and present
the first in-the-wild industrial-grade waste detection and segmentation
dataset, ZeroWaste. We believe that ZeroWaste will catalyze research in object
detection and semantic segmentation in extreme clutter as well as applications

Gini indices of two semicontinuous populations. We characterize the
distribution of each semicontinuous population by a mixture of a discrete point
mass at zero and a continuous skewed positive component. A semiparametric
density ratio model is then employed to link the positive components of the two
distributions. We propose the maximum empirical likelihood estimators of the
two Gini indices and their difference, and further investigate the asymptotic
properties of the proposed estimators. The asymptotic results enable us to
construct confidence intervals and perform hypothesis tests for the two Gini
indices and their difference. We show that the proposed estimators are more
efficient than the existing fully nonparametric estimators. The proposed
estimators and the asymptotic results are also applicable to cases without
excessive zero values. Simulation studies show the superiority of our proposed

When simulating an imaging technology intended for clinical use, it is
essential to employ realistic numerical phantoms that can facilitate the
objective, or task-based, assessment of image quality. Moreover, when computing
objective image quality measures, an ensemble of such phantoms should be
employed that display the variability in anatomy and object properties that is
representative of the to-be-imaged patient cohort. Such stochastic phantoms for
clinically relevant applications of USCT are currently lacking. In this work, a
methodology for producing realistic three-dimensional (3D) numerical breast

breast imaging is presented. By extending and adapting an existing stochastic
3D breast phantom for use withUSCT, methods for creating ensembles of numerical
acoustic breast phantoms are established. These breast phantoms will possess
clinically relevant variations in breast size, composition, acoustic
properties, tumor locations, and tissue textures. To demonstrate the use of the
phantoms in virtual USCT studies, two brief case studies are presented that
address the development and assessment of image reconstruction procedures.

aware of the zero-sum structure of the underlying game, a setting also referred
to as radically uncoupled in the literature of learning in games. In this
paper, we develop a radically uncoupled Q-learning dynamics that is both
rational and convergent: the learning dynamics converges to the best response
to the opponent's strategy when the opponent follows an asymptotically
stationary strategy; when both agents adopt the learning dynamics, they
converge to the Nash equilibrium of the game. The key challenge in this
decentralized setting is the non-stationarity of the environment from an
agent's perspective, since both her own payoffs and the system evolution depend
on the actions of other agents, and each agent adapts her policies
simultaneously and independently. To address this issue, we develop a
two-timescale learning dynamics where each agent updates her local Q-function

inspiration from a popular framework in neuroscience: 'predictive coding'. At
each layer of the hierarchical model, generative feedback 'predicts' (i.e.,
reconstructs) the pattern of activity in the previous layer. The reconstruction
errors are used to iteratively update the network's representations across
timesteps, and to optimize the network's feedback weights over the natural
image dataset-a form of unsupervised training. We show that implementing this
strategy into two popular networks, VGG16 and EfficientNetB0, improves their
robustness against various corruptions and adversarial attacks. We hypothesize
that other feedforward networks could similarly benefit from the proposed
framework. To promote research in this direction, we provide an open-sourced
PyTorch-based package called Predify, which can be used to implement and
investigate the impacts of the predictive coding dynamics in any convolutional

Pauli statistics, without using orbitals is the open problem of orbital-free
density functional theory. An important aspect of this problem is correctly
reproducing the Pauli potential, the response of the Pauli kinetic energy to a
change in density. We analyze the behavior of the Pauli potential of
non-relativistic neutral atoms under Lieb-Simon scaling -- the process of
taking nuclear charge and particle number to infinity, in which the kinetic
energy tends to the Thomas-Fermi limit. We do this by mathematical analysis of
the near-nuclear region and by calculating the exact orbital-dependent Pauli
potential using the approach of Ouyang and Levy for closed-shell atoms out to
element Z=976. In rough analogy to Lieb and Simon's own findings for the charge
density, we find that the potential does not converge smoothly to the
Thomas-Fermi limit on a point-by-point basis but separates into several
distinct regions of behavior. Near the nucleus, the potential approaches a
constant given by the difference in energy between the lowest and highest
occupied eigenvalues. We discover a transition region in the outer core where
the potential deviates unexpectedly and predictably from both the Thomas-Fermi
potential and the gradient expansion correction to it. These results may
provide insight into semi-classical description of Pauli statistics, and new
constraints to aid the improvement of orbital-free DFT functionals.

for verifying the accuracy of different techniques, and for investigating the
assumptions inherent in each method. NGC 4151 is one of those rare galaxies for
which multiple methods can be used: stellar and gas dynamical modeling because
of its proximity ($D=15.8\pm0.4$ Mpc from Cepheids), and reverberation mapping
because of its active accretion. In this work, we re-analyzed $H-$band integral
field spectroscopy of the nucleus of NGC 4151 from Gemini NIFS, improving the
analysis at several key steps. We then constructed a wide range of axisymmetric
dynamical models with the new orbit-superposition code Forstand. One of our
primary goals is to quantify the systematic uncertainties in $M_\mathrm{BH}$
arising from different combinations of the deprojected density profile,
inclination, intrinsic flattening, and mass-to-light ratio. As a consequence of
uncertainties on the stellar luminosity profile arising from the presence of
the AGN, our constraints on \mbh are rather weak. Models with a steep central
cusp are consistent with no black hole; however, in models with more moderate
cusps, the black hole mass lies within the range of $0.25\times10^7\,M_\odot
\lesssim M_\mathrm{BH} \lesssim 3\times10^7\,M_\odot$. This measurement is
somewhat smaller than the earlier analysis presented by Onken et al., but
agrees with previous $M_\mathrm{BH}$ values from gas dynamical modeling and
reverberation mapping. Future dynamical modeling of reverberation data, as well

  Ordering","To be published in KDD 2021",,,,"cs.SI cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Triangle counting is a fundamental technique in network analysis, that has
received much attention in various input models. The vast majority of triangle
counting algorithms are targeted to static graphs. Yet, many real-world graphs
are directed and temporal, where edges come with timestamps. Temporal triangles
yield much more information, since they account for both the graph topology and
the timestamps.
  Temporal triangle counting has seen a few recent results, but there are
varying definitions of temporal triangles. In all cases, temporal triangle
patterns enforce constraints on the time interval between edges (in the
triangle). We define a general notion $(\delta_{1,3}, \delta_{1,2},
\delta_{2,3})$-temporal triangles that allows for separate time constraints for
all pairs of edges.
  Our main result is a new algorithm, DOTTT (Degeneracy Oriented Temporal
Triangle Totaler), that exactly counts all directed variants of $(\delta_{1,3},
\delta_{1,2}, \delta_{2,3})$-temporal triangles. Using the classic idea of
degeneracy ordering with careful combinatorial arguments, we can prove that
DOTTT runs in $O(m\kappa\log m)$ time, where $m$ is the number of (temporal)
edges and $\kappa$ is the graph degeneracy (max core number). Up to log
factors, this matches the running time of the best static triangle counters.
Moreover, this running time is better than existing.
  DOTTT has excellent practical behavior and runs twice as fast as existing
state-of-the-art temporal triangle counters (and is also more general). For
example, DOTTT computes all types of temporal queries in Bitcoin temporal
network with half a billion edges in less than an hour on a commodity machine.

to characterize the plasma for various biases (positive and negative) to the

observed that only a positively biased disk increases the plasma potential,
electron temperature, and plasma density. Moreover, the plasma parameters
remain unaltered when the disk is negatively biased. The observed results for
two different-sized positively metal disks are compared with an available
theoretical model and found an opposite behavior of plasma density variation
with the disk bias voltages at given discharge condition. The role of the
primary energetic electron population in determining the plasma parameters is
discussed. These experimental results are qualitatively explained on the basis
of electrostatic confinement arising due to the loss of electrons to a biased

not take into account bidirectional latent relations of user preferences across
source-target domain pairs. As such, they cannot provide enhanced cross-domain
CTR predictions for both domains simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach to cross-domain sequential recommendations based on the dual
learning mechanism that simultaneously transfers information between two
related domains in an iterative manner until the learning process stabilizes.
In particular, the proposed Dual Attentive Sequential Learning (DASL) model
consists of two novel components Dual Embedding and Dual Attention, which
jointly establish the two-stage learning process: we first construct dual
latent embeddings that extract user preferences in both domains simultaneously,
and subsequently provide cross-domain recommendations by matching the extracted
latent embeddings with candidate items through dual-attention learning
mechanism. We conduct extensive offline experiments on three real-world

feature in the quest for an optimal cut-point in the range of feature values in
each node. Sorting is an expensive operation in MPC, hence finding secure
protocols that avoid such an expensive step is a relevant problem in
privacy-preserving machine learning. In this paper we propose three more
efficient alternatives for secure training of decision tree based models on
data with continuous features, namely: (1) secure discretization of the data,
followed by secure training of a decision tree over the discretized data; (2)
secure discretization of the data, followed by secure training of a random
forest over the discretized data; and (3) secure training of extremely
randomized trees (``extra-trees'') on the original data. Approaches (2) and (3)
both involve randomizing feature choices. In addition, in approach (3)
cut-points are chosen randomly as well, thereby alleviating the need to sort or
to discretize the data up front. We implemented all proposed solutions in the
semi-honest setting with additive secret sharing based MPC. In addition to
mathematically proving that all proposed approaches are correct and secure, we
experimentally evaluated and compared them in terms of classification accuracy
and runtime. We privately train tree ensembles over data sets with 1000s of
instances or features in a few minutes, with accuracies that are at par with
those obtained in the clear. This makes our solution orders of magnitude more
efficient than the existing approaches, which are based on oblivious sorting.

fusing them at the pixel level is potentially more beneficial. This is also
more challenging in part due to the sparsity of radar, but also because
automotive radar beams are much wider than a typical pixel combined with a
large baseline between camera and radar, which results in poor association
between radar pixels and color pixel. A consequence is that depth completion
methods designed for LiDAR and video fare poorly for radar and video. Here we
propose a radar-to-pixel association stage which learns a mapping from radar
returns to pixels. This mapping also serves to densify radar returns. Using
this as a first stage, followed by a more traditional depth completion method,
we are able to achieve image-guided depth completion with radar and video. We
demonstrate performance superior to camera and radar alone on the nuScenes

On the other hand, it is found that both the positive and negative electric
currents increased equivalently and the average flux-weighted force-free
parameter $\tilde \alpha$ remains almost consistently positive, on the order of
$\sim$ 10$^{-8}$ m$^{-1}$. The relative magnetic helicity is mainly contributed
by the shear term, while the relative magnetic helicity injection flux of the

flexible method for modeling pre-eruptive magnetic configurations of coronal
mass ejections (CMEs) whose characteristics are constrained by observational
images and magnetic-field data. This method allows one to calculate the field
of magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) with small circular cross-sections and an
arbitrary axis shape. The field of the whole configuration is constructed as a
superposition of (1) such a flux-rope field and (2) an ambient potential field
derived, for example, from an observed magnetogram. The RBSL kernels are
determined from the requirement that the MFR field for a straight cylinder must
be exactly force-free. For a curved MFR, however, the magnetic forces are
generally unbalanced over the whole path of the MFR. To minimize these forces,
we apply a modified Gauss-Newton method to find optimal MFR parameters. This is
done by iteratively adjusting the MFR axis path and axial current. We then try
to relax the resulting optimized configuration in a subsequent line-tied
zero-beta magnetohydrodynamic simulation toward a force-free equilibrium. By
considering two models of the sigmoidal pre-eruption configuration for the 2009
February 13 CME, we demonstrate how this approach works and what it is capable
of. We show, in particular, that the building blocks of the core magnetic
structure described by these models match to morphological features typically
observed in such type of configurations. Our method will be useful for both the
modeling of particular eruptive events and theoretical studies of idealized
pre-eruptive MFR configurations.

powering high-energy flares in astrophysical sources including pulsar wind
nebulae and black hole jets. Reconnection is usually seen as the (essentially
2D) nonlinear evolution of the tearing instability disrupting a thin current
sheet. To test how this process operates in 3D, we conduct a comprehensive
particle-in-cell simulation study comparing 2D and 3D evolution of long, thin
current sheets in moderately-magnetized, collisionless, relativistically-hot
electron-positron plasma, and find dramatic differences. We first
systematically characterize this process in 2D, where classic, hierarchical
plasmoid-chain reconnection determines energy release, and explore a wide range
of initial configurations, guide magnetic field strengths, and system sizes. We
then show that 3D simulations of similar configurations exhibit a diversity of
behaviours, including some where energy release is determined by the nonlinear
relativistic drift-kink instability. Thus, 3D current-sheet evolution is not
always fundamentally classical reconnection with perturbing 3D effects, but,
rather, a complex interplay of multiple linear and nonlinear instabilities
whose relative importance depends sensitively on the ambient plasma, minor
configuration details, and even stochastic events. It often yields slower but
longer-lasting and ultimately greater magnetic energy release than in 2D.
Intriguingly, nonthermal particle acceleration is astonishingly robust,
depending on the upstream magnetization and guide field, but otherwise yielding
similar particle energy spectra in 2D and 3D. Though the variety of underlying
current-sheet behaviours is interesting, the similarities in overall energy
release and particle spectra may be more remarkable.

red maple (A. rubrum) generate high positive stem pressure in response to
repeated freeze-thaw cycles. This elevated xylem pressure permits sap to be
harvested over a period of several weeks and hence is a major factor in the
viability of the maple syrup industry. The extensive literature on sap
exudation documents various competing hypotheses regarding the physical and
biological mechanisms driving positive pressure generation in maple, but to
date relatively little effort has been expended on devising detailed
mathematical models for the exudation process. In this paper, we utilize an
existing model of Graf et al. [J. Roy. Soc. Interface 12:20150665, 2015] that
describes heat and mass transport within the multiphase gas-liquid-ice mixture
within the porous xylem tissue. The model captures the inherent multiscale
nature of xylem transport by including phase change and osmotic transport
within wood cells on the microscale, which is coupled to heat transport through
the tree stem on the macroscale. We extend this model by incorporating a root
reflection coefficient that introduces an asymmetry in root water flux and
hence permits a more realistic accumulation of stem pressure. A parametric
study based on simulations with synthetic temperature data singles out the
essential model parameters that have greatest impact on stem pressure build-up.
Measured daily temperature fluctuations are then used as model inputs and the
resulting simulated pressures are compared directly with experimental
measurements taken from mature red and sugar maple stems during the sap harvest
season. The results demonstrate that our multiscale freeze-thaw model
reproduces realistic exudation behavior, thereby providing novel insights into
the specific physical mechanisms that dominate positive pressure generation in
maple trees.

verifiable in most real-world applications. Consequently, network modeling
based on these methods either suffers from model misspecification or relies on
additional model selection procedures that are not well understood in theory

propose a mixing strategy that leverages available arbitrary models to improve
their individual performances. The proposed method is computationally efficient
and almost tuning-free; thus, it can be used as an off-the-shelf method for
network modeling. We show that the proposed method performs equally well as the
oracle estimate when the true model is included as individual candidates. More
importantly, the method remains robust and outperforms all current estimates

Points2Polygons performs well against existing fully-supervised segmentation
baselines with limited training data, despite using lightweight segmentation

  Networks","to be published in KDD'2021",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Imbalanced classification on graphs is ubiquitous yet challenging in many
real-world applications, such as fraudulent node detection. Recently, graph
neural networks (GNNs) have shown promising performance on many network
analysis tasks. However, most existing GNNs have almost exclusively focused on
the balanced networks, and would get unappealing performance on the imbalanced
networks. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we present a generative
adversarial graph network model, called ImGAGN to address the imbalanced
classification problem on graphs. It introduces a novel generator for graph
structure data, named GraphGenerator, which can simulate both the minority
class nodes' attribute distribution and network topological structure
distribution by generating a set of synthetic minority nodes such that the
number of nodes in different classes can be balanced. Then a graph
convolutional network (GCN) discriminator is trained to discriminate between
real nodes and fake (i.e., generated) nodes, and also between minority nodes
and majority nodes on the synthetic balanced network. To validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments are conducted on
four real-world imbalanced network datasets. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method ImGAGN outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms for
semi-supervised imbalanced node classification task.

fluid mechanics as they allow study and investigation of elongational flows. In
this article, the uniaxial elongational flow appearing at the surface of a
viscoelastic drop and its role on the deformation of the droplet at low
inertial regimes is studied. In studies related to viscoelastic droplets
falling/raising in an immiscible Newtonian fluids, it is well known that by
increasing the Deborah number (the ratio of the relaxation time of the interior
fluid to a reference time scale) the droplet might lose its sphericity and
obtain a dimple at the rear end. In this work, the drop deformation is
investigated in detail to study the reason behind this transformation. We will
show that as the contribution of elastic and inertial forces are increased, the
stagnation points at the rear and front sides of the droplet are expanded to
create a region of elongational dominated flows. At this stage, due to a
combined effect of the shear thickening behavior of the elongational viscosity
in viscoelastic fluids and the contribution of the inertial force, the interior
phase is squeezed and consequently the droplet finds a shape similar to an
oblate. As these non-linear forces are increased further, an additional
circular stagnation line appears on the droplet surface in the external field,
pulling the droplet surface outward and therefore creating a dimple shape at
the rear end. Furthermore, the influence of inertia and viscoelastic properties
are also studied on the motion, the drag coefficient and terminal velocity of
drops.

inverting GNN, one of the state-of-the-art graph analysis tools. Specifically,
we firstly propose a projected gradient module to tackle the discreteness of

curves, consisting of all conics sharing a focus at a fixed point. We study the
geometry and symmetry properties of this family, as well as natural 2-parameter
subfamilies, such as those of fixed energy or angular momentum.
  Our main result is that Kepler orbits is a `flat' family, that is, the local
diffeomorphisms of the plane preserving this family form a 7-dimensional local
group, the maximum dimension possible for the symmetry group of a 3-parameter
family of plane curves. These symmetries are different from the well-studied
`hidden' symmetries of the Kepler problem, acting on energy levels in the
4-dimensional phase space of the Kepler system.
  Each 2-parameter subfamily of Kepler orbits with fixed non-zero energy
(Kepler ellipses or hyperbolas with fixed length of major axis) admits
$\mathrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$ as its (local) symmetry group, corresponding to
one of the items of a classification due to A. Tresse (1896) of 2-parameter
families of plane curves admitting a 3-dimensional local group of symmetries.
The 2-parameter subfamilies with zero energy (Kepler parabolas) or fixed
non-zero angular momentum are flat (locally diffeomorphic to the family of
straight lines).
  These results can be proved using techniques developed in the 19th century by
S. Lie to determine `infinitesimal point symmetries' of ODEs, but our proofs
are much simpler, using a projective geometric model for the Kepler orbits
(plane sections of a cone in projective 3-space). In this projective model all
symmetry groups act globally.
  Another advantage of the projective model is a duality between Kepler's plane
and Minkowski's 3-space parametrizing the space of Kepler orbits. We use this
duality to deduce several results on the Kepler system, old and new.

forest on top of CNNs, which enjoys two characteristics: 1) During training,
the tree hierarchies of the forest are learned in a top-down manner under the
guidance from the category semantics embedded in the pre-trained CNN weights;
2) During inference, a single decision tree is dynamically selected from the
forest for each input sample, enabling the transferred model to make sequential
decisions corresponding to the attributes shared by semantically-similar
categories, rather than directly performing flat classification. We name the
transferred model deep Dynamic Sequential Decision Forest (dDSDF). Experimental
results show that dDSDF not only achieves higher classification accuracy than
its conuterpart, i.e., the original CNN, but has much better interpretability,
as qualitatively it has plausible hierarchies and quantitatively it leads to
more precise saliency maps.

Simulations are carried out with the codes EUTERPE, GENE, GENE-3D, and stella

flow relaxation properties obtained in different flux tubes are found to differ
with each other and with the radially global result, except for sufficiently
long flux tubes, in general. The flux tube length required for convergence is
configuration-dependent. Similarly, for ITG instabilities, different flux tubes
provide different results, but the discrepancy between them diminishes with
increasing flux tube length. Full-flux-surface and flux tube simulations show
good agreement in the calculation of the growth rate and frequency of the most
unstable modes in LHD, while for W7-X differences in the growth rates are found
between the flux tube and the full-flux-surface domains. Radially global

scale of unstable ITG modes is studied in global and flux tube simulations
finding that in W7-X, the radial scale of the most unstable modes depends on

the least-square loss function is well justified under the standard Gaussian

Consequently, we propose a more general entropy-based loss that is

industrial fields. In fields such as finance, medicine, and autonomous driving,
where the inference results of a model may have serious consequences, high
interpretability as well as prediction accuracy is required. In this study, we
propose CGA2M+, which is based on the Generalized Additive 2 Model (GA2M) and
differs from it in two major ways. The first is the introduction of
monotonicity. Imposing monotonicity on some functions based on an analyst's
knowledge is expected to improve not only interpretability but also
generalization performance. The second is the introduction of a higher-order
term: given that GA2M considers only second-order interactions, we aim to
balance interpretability and prediction accuracy by introducing a higher-order
term that can capture higher-order interactions. In this way, we can improve
prediction performance without compromising interpretability by applying
learning innovation. Numerical experiments showed that the proposed model has
high predictive performance and interpretability. Furthermore, we confirmed
that generalization performance is improved by introducing monotonicity.

time-harmonic Maxwell's equations in their first-order formulation. By
minimizing a quadratic cost functional, which measures the deviation from
periodicity, the controllability method determines iteratively a periodic
solution in the time domain. At each conjugate gradient iteration, the gradient
of the cost functional is simply computed by running any time-dependent
simulation code forward and backward for one period, thus leading to a
non-intrusive implementation easily integrated into existing software.
Moreover, the proposed algorithm automatically inherits the parallelism,
scalability, and low memory footprint of the underlying time-domain solver.
Since the time-periodic solution obtained by minimization is not necessarily
unique, we apply a cheap post-processing filtering procedure which recovers the
time-harmonic solution from any minimizer. Finally, we present a series of
numerical examples which show that our algorithm greatly speeds up the
convergence towards the desired time-harmonic solution when compared to simply
running the time-marching code until the time-harmonic regime is eventually
reached.

many computer vision problems. In recent years, a new class of CNNs, recurrent
convolution neural network (RCNN), inspired by abundant recurrent connections
in the visual systems of animals, was proposed. The critical element of RCNN is
the recurrent convolutional layer (RCL), which incorporates recurrent
connections between neurons in the standard convolutional layer. With
increasing number of recurrent computations, the receptive fields (RFs) of
neurons in RCL expand unboundedly, which is inconsistent with biological facts.
We propose to modulate the RFs of neurons by introducing gates to the recurrent
connections. The gates control the amount of context information inputting to
the neurons and the neurons' RFs therefore become adaptive. The resulting layer
is called gated recurrent convolution layer (GRCL). Multiple GRCLs constitute a
deep model called gated RCNN (GRCNN). The GRCNN was evaluated on several
computer vision tasks including object recognition, scene text recognition and
object detection, and obtained much better results than the RCNN. In addition,
when combined with other adaptive RF techniques, the GRCNN demonstrated
competitive performance to the state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets

tax on all assets. When assets are created by specialized effort rather than by

the government awards a prize for the creation of the asset and then collects
the remaining value of the asset in taxes. Analytically, the prize is like a

size by allowing the modelling of variable size images within a deep learning

different scanning techniques used to sample patches. To establish the
efficiency of our approach, we trained and tested our model on two datasets,
microscopy images and WSI tumour regions. After comparing with contemporary
literature we achieved the better performance with accuracy of 90% for

classification results with deep learning networks such as ResNet, DenseNet,

to the effectiveness of its generated adversarial samples due to the existence

FCs that capture little semantic information. With FAA-generated samples, the
training can continue the 'random walk' and drift into an area with a flat loss
landscape, leading to more robust domain adaptation. Extensive experiments over

sparse external ones. In this paper, based on the connectivity behavior of
nodes and homogeneity of attributes, we propose a principle model (named GNAN),
which can generate both topology information and attribute information. The new
model can detect not only community structure, but also a range of other types
of structure in networks, such as bipartite structure, core-periphery
structure, and their mixture structure, which are collectively referred to as
generalized structure. The proposed model that combines topological information
and node-attribute information can detect communities more accurately than the
model that only uses topology information. The dependency between attributes
and communities can be automatically learned by our model and thus we can
ignore the attributes that do not contain useful information. The model
parameters are inferred by using the expectation-maximization algorithm. And a
case study is provided to show the ability of our model in the semantic
interpretability of communities. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world

these passive devices cannot carry out transmit/receive signal processing. The
existing channel estimation methods conceived for wideband IRS-aided

ignore the effect of beam squint, despite its severe performance degradation.
Hence we fill this gap and conceive wideband channel estimation for IRS-aided

consideration. We demonstrate that the mutual correlation function between the
spatial steering vectors and the cascaded two-hop channel reflected by the IRS
has two peaks, which leads to a pair of estimated angles for a single
propagation path, due to the effect of beam squint. One of these two estimated
angles is the frequency-independent `actual angle', while the other one is the
frequency-dependent `false angle'. To reduce the influence of false angles on

Topology Adaptive Edge Dropping (TADropEdge) method as an adaptive data
augmentation technique to improve generalization performance and learn robust
GNN models. We start by explicitly analyzing how random edge dropping increases
the data diversity during training, while indicating i.i.d. edge dropping does
not account for graph structural information and could result in noisy
augmented data degrading performance. To overcome this issue, we consider graph
connectivity as the key property that captures graph topology. TADropEdge
incorporates this factor into random edge dropping such that the edge-dropped
subgraphs maintain similar topology as the underlying graph, yielding more
satisfactory data augmentation. In particular, TADropEdge first leverages the
graph spectrum to assign proper weights to graph edges, which represent their
criticality for establishing the graph connectivity. It then normalizes the
edge weights and drops graph edges adaptively based on their normalized
weights. Besides improving generalization performance, TADropEdge reduces
variance for efficient training and can be applied as a generic method modular
to different GNN models. Intensive experiments on real-life and synthetic

provide high-quality speech audio and live captioning under various noise
conditions. However, most monaural speech enhancement (SE) models introduce
processing artifacts and thus degrade the performance of downstream tasks,
including automatic speech recognition (ASR). This paper proposes a multi-task
training framework to make the SE models unharmful to ASR. Because most ASR
training samples do not have corresponding clean signal references, we
alternately perform two model update steps called SE-step and ASR-step. The
SE-step uses clean and noisy signal pairs and a signal-based loss function. The
ASR-step applies a pre-trained ASR model to training signals enhanced with the
SE model. A cross-entropy loss between the ASR output and reference
transcriptions is calculated to update the SE model parameters. Experimental
results with realistic large-scale settings using ASR models trained on
75,000-hour data show that the proposed framework improves the word error rate
for the SE output by 11.82% with little compromise in the SE quality.
Performance analysis is also carried out by changing the ASR model, the data
used for the ASR-step, and the schedule of the two update steps.

with numerous learnable parameters for the accuracy reason. To alleviate the
expensive costs of deploying them on mobile devices, recent works have made
huge efforts for excavating redundancy in pre-defined architectures.
Nevertheless, the redundancy on the input resolution of modern CNNs has not
been fully investigated, i.e., the resolution of input image is fixed. In this
paper, we observe that the smallest resolution for accurately predicting the
given image is different using the same neural network. To this end, we propose
a novel dynamic-resolution network (DRNet) in which the input resolution is
determined dynamically based on each input sample. Wherein, a resolution
predictor with negligible computational costs is explored and optimized jointly
with the desired network. Specifically, the predictor learns the smallest
resolution that can retain and even exceed the original recognition accuracy
for each image. During the inference, each input image will be resized to its
predicted resolution for minimizing the overall computation burden. We then
conduct extensive experiments on several benchmark networks and datasets. The
results show that our DRNet can be embedded in any off-the-shelf network
architecture to obtain a considerable reduction in computational complexity.
For instance, DR-ResNet-50 achieves similar performance with an about 34%
computation reduction, while gaining 1.4% accuracy increase with 10%
computation reduction compared to the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet.

Spectroscopy (TDLAS) tomography has been widely used for imaging of

been proofed to be more robust and accurate for image reconstruction,
particularly in case of limited access of laser beams in the Region of Interest
(RoI). In practice, flame in the RoI that requires to be reconstructed with
good spatial resolution is commonly surrounded by low-temperature background.
Although the background is not of high interest, spectroscopic absorption still
exists due to heat dissipation and gas convection. Therefore, we propose a
Pseudo-Inversed CNN (PI-CNN) for hierarchical temperature imaging that (a) uses
efficiently the training and learning resources for temperature imaging in the
RoI with good spatial resolution, and (b) reconstructs the less spatially
resolved background temperature by adequately addressing the integrity of the
spectroscopic absorption model. In comparison with the traditional CNN, the
newly introduced pseudo inversion of the RoI sensitivity matrix is more
penetrating for revealing the inherent correlation between the projection data
and the RoI to be reconstructed, thus prioritising the temperature imaging in
the RoI with high accuracy and high computational efficiency. In this paper,
the proposed algorithm was validated by both numerical simulation and lab-scale
experiment, indicating good agreement between the phantoms and the
high-fidelity reconstructions.

article, we probe BERT specifically to understand and measure the relational
knowledge it captures in its parametric memory. While probing for linguistic
understanding is commonly applied to all layers of BERT as well as fine-tuned
models, this has not been done for factual knowledge. We utilize existing
knowledge base completion tasks (LAMA) to probe every layer of pre-trained as
well as fine-tuned BERT models(ranking, question answering, NER). Our findings
show that knowledge is not just contained in BERT's final layers. Intermediate
layers contribute a significant amount (17-60%) to the total knowledge found.
Probing intermediate layers also reveals how different types of knowledge
emerge at varying rates. When BERT is fine-tuned, relational knowledge is
forgotten. The extent of forgetting is impacted by the fine-tuning objective
and the training data. We found that ranking models forget the least and retain
more knowledge in their final layer compared to masked language modeling and
question-answering. However, masked language modeling performed the best at
acquiring new knowledge from the training data. When it comes to learning
facts, we found that capacity and fact density are key factors. We hope this

is highly desired for condensed matter physics. Schemes to achieve this have
been proposed theoretically, but few can be realized experimentally. Here,
combining transverse transport, theoretical calculations, and scanning
tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/S) investigations, we provide an
observation that the topological electronic states, accompanied by an emergent
magneto-transport phenomenon, were modulated by applying magnetic fields
through induced non-collinear magnetism in the magnetic Weyl semimetal EuB6. A
giant unconventional anomalous Hall effect (UAHE) is found during the
magnetisation re-orientation from easy axis to hard ones in magnetic fields,
with a UAHE peak around the low field of 5 kOe. Under the reasonable
spin-canting effect, the folding of the topological anti-crossing bands occurs,
generating a strong Berry curvature that accounts for the observed UAHE.
Field-dependent STM/S reveals a highly synchronous evolution of electronic
density of states, with a dI/dV peak around the same field of 5 kOe, which
provides evidence to the folded bands and excited UAHE by external magnetic
fields. This finding elucidates the connection between the real-space
non-collinear magnetism and the k-space topological electronic states and
establishes a novel manner to engineer the magneto-transport behaviours of
correlated electrons for future topological spintronics.

transport. These anomalous transport behaviors can be further understood by
considering nonlinear magnetic textures and the chiral magnetic field
associated with Weyl fermions, extending the longitudinal and transverse
transport physics and providing novel degrees of freedom in the spintronic
applications of emerging topological magnets.

In this paper, we propose a simple and effective regularization strategy from a
new perspective of evolution of features, which we call feature flow
regularization (FFR), for improving structured sparsity and filter pruning in

feature flow along the neural network, which implicitly increases the sparsity
of the parameters. The principle behind FFR is that coherent and smooth
evolution of features will lead to an efficient network that avoids redundant
parameters. The high structured sparsity obtained from FFR enables us to prune
filters effectively. Experiments with VGGNets, ResNets on CIFAR-10/100, and
Tiny ImageNet datasets demonstrate that FFR can significantly improve both
unstructured and structured sparsity. Our pruning results in terms of reduction
of parameters and FLOPs are comparable to or even better than those of

that the dynamics of the forward shock mostly follows the Sedov-Taylor

calculate synthetic synchrotron emissivity maps and light curves using two

remain of interest because of their potential for accelerating training through
the use of curvature information. Several methods with non-diagonal
preconditioning matrices, including KFAC, Shampoo, and K-BFGS, have been
proposed and shown to be effective. Based on the so-called tensor normal (TN)
distribution, we propose and analyze a brand new approximate natural gradient
method, Tensor Normal Training (TNT), which like Shampoo, only requires
knowledge of the shape of the training parameters. By approximating the
probabilistically based Fisher matrix, as opposed to the empirical Fisher
matrix, our method uses the block-wise covariance of the sampling based
gradient as the pre-conditioning matrix. Moreover, the assumption that the
sampling-based (tensor) gradient follows a TN distribution, ensures that its
covariance has a Kronecker separable structure, which leads to a tractable
approximation to the Fisher matrix. Consequently, TNT's memory requirements and
per-iteration computational costs are only slightly higher than those for
first-order methods. In our experiments, TNT exhibited superior optimization
performance to state-of-the-art first-order methods, and comparable
optimization performance to the state-of-the-art second-order methods KFAC and
Shampoo. Moreover, TNT demonstrated its ability to generalize as well as
first-order methods, while using fewer epochs.

generate electricity. The power curve of a wind turbine, which exhibits the
relationship between generated power and wind speed, plays a major role in
assessing the performance of a wind farm. Neural networks have been used for
power curve estimation. However, they do not produce a confidence measure for
their output, unless computationally prohibitive Bayesian methods are used. In
this paper, a probabilistic neural network with Monte Carlo dropout is
considered to quantify the model (epistemic) uncertainty of the power curve
estimation. This approach offers a minimal increase in computational complexity
over deterministic approaches. Furthermore, by incorporating a probabilistic
loss function, the noise or aleatoric uncertainty in the data is estimated. The
developed network captures both model and noise uncertainty which is found to
be useful tools in assessing performance. Also, the developed network is
compared with existing ones across a public domain dataset showing superior
performance in terms of prediction accuracy.

  Relationship to Partial Differential Equations and Probability Theory",,,,,"math.FA math.AP math.PR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Previously, we have introduced a very small number of examples of what we
call Ouroboros functions. Using our already established theory of Ouroboros
spaces and their functions, we will provide a set of families of Ouroboros
functions that bolster our overall understanding of the Ouroboros spaces. From
here, we extend the theory of Ouroboros functions by introducing Ouroboros
functionals and Ouroboros functional spaces. Furthermore, we re-frame the
expected value of a random variable as an Ouroboros functional, which proves to
be more intuitive in view of probabilistic measure theory. We then show that
these Ouroboros functions have additional applications, as they are general
solutions to certain elementary linear first order partial differential
equations (PDEs). We conclude by elaborating upon this connection and
discussing future endeavors, which will be centered on answering a given
hypothesis.

  Reinforcement Learning","24 pages, 17 figures, 5 tables",,,,"cs.MA cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Population-based multi-agent reinforcement learning (PB-MARL) refers to the
series of methods nested with reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, which
produces a self-generated sequence of tasks arising from the coupled population
dynamics. By leveraging auto-curricula to induce a population of distinct
emergent strategies, PB-MARL has achieved impressive success in tackling
multi-agent tasks. Despite remarkable prior arts of distributed RL frameworks,
PB-MARL poses new challenges for parallelizing the training frameworks due to
the additional complexity of multiple nested workloads between sampling,
training and evaluation involved with heterogeneous policy interactions. To
solve these problems, we present MALib, a scalable and efficient computing
framework for PB-MARL. Our framework is comprised of three key components: (1)
a centralized task dispatching model, which supports the self-generated tasks
and scalable training with heterogeneous policy combinations; (2) a programming
architecture named Actor-Evaluator-Learner, which achieves high parallelism for
both training and sampling, and meets the evaluation requirement of
auto-curriculum learning; (3) a higher-level abstraction of MARL training
paradigms, which enables efficient code reuse and flexible deployments on
different distributed computing paradigms. Experiments on a series of complex
tasks such as multi-agent Atari Games show that MALib achieves throughput
higher than 40K FPS on a single machine with $32$ CPU cores; 5x speedup than
RLlib and at least 3x speedup than OpenSpiel in multi-agent training tasks.

by satisfying its boundary value problem through a neural network's loss
function. The PINN approach has shown great success in approximating the map
between the solution of a partial differential equation (PDE) and its
spatio-temporal input. However, for strongly non-linear and higher order
partial differential equations PINN's accuracy reduces significantly. To
resolve this problem, we propose a novel PINN scheme that solves the PDE
sequentially over successive time segments using a single neural network. The
key idea is to re-train the same neural network for solving the PDE over
successive time segments while satisfying the already obtained solution for all
previous time segments. Thus it is named as backward compatible PINN (bc-PINN).
To illustrate the advantages of bc-PINN, we have used the Cahn Hilliard and
Allen Cahn equations, which are widely used to describe phase separation and
reaction diffusion systems. Our results show significant improvement in
accuracy over the PINN method while using a smaller number of collocation
points. Additionally, we have shown that using the phase space technique for a
higher order PDE could further improve the accuracy and efficiency of the
bc-PINN scheme.

chemical industry are granular materials. The Discrete Element Method (DEM)
provides detailed insights of phenomena at particle scale and it is therefore
often used for modeling granular materials. However, because DEM tracks the
motion and contact of individual particles separately, its computational cost
increases non-linearly $O(n_p\log(n_p))$ -- $O(n_p^2)$ depending on the
algorithm) with the number of particles ($n_p$). In this article, we introduce
a new open-source parallel DEM software with load balancing: Lethe-DEM.
Lethe-DEM, a module of Lethe, consists of solvers for two-dimensional and
three-dimensional DEM simulations. Load-balancing allows Lethe-DEM to
significantly increase the parallel efficiency by $\approx 25 - 70 \%$
depending on the granular simulation. We explain the fundamental modules of
Lethe-DEM, its software architecture, and the governing equations. Furthermore,
we verify Lethe-DEM with several tests including analytical solutions and
comparison with other software. Comparisons with experiments in a flat-bottomed
silo, wedge-shaped silo, and rotating drum validate Lethe-DEM. We investigate
the strong and weak scaling of Lethe-DEM with $1 \leq n_c \leq 192$ and $32
\leq n_c \leq 320$ processes, respectively, with and without load-balancing.
The strong-scaling analysis is performed on the wedge-shaped silo and rotating
drum simulations, while for the weak-scaling analysis, we use a dam break
simulation. The best scalability of Lethe-DEM is obtained in the range of $5000
\leq n_p/n_c \leq 15000$. Finally, we demonstrate that large scale simulations
can be carried out with Lethe-DEM using the simulation of a three-dimensional
cylindrical silo with $n_p=4.3 \times 10^6$ on 320 cores.

for modeling well-mixed chemical reaction networks and other physical systems
where agents exchange information in pairwise interactions, but have no control
over their schedule of interaction partners. The well-studied *majority*
problem is that of determining in an initial population of $n$ agents, each
with one of two opinions $A$ or $B$, whether there are more $A$, more $B$, or a
tie. A *stable* protocol solves this problem with probability 1 by eventually
entering a configuration in which all agents agree on a correct consensus
decision of $\mathsf{A}$, $\mathsf{B}$, or $\mathsf{T}$, from which the
consensus cannot change. We describe a protocol that solves this problem using
$O(\log n)$ states ($\log \log n + O(1)$ bits of memory) and optimal expected
time $O(\log n)$. The number of states $O(\log n)$ is known to be optimal for
the class of polylogarithmic time stable protocols that are ""output dominant""
and ""monotone"". These are two natural constraints satisfied by our protocol,
making it simultaneously time- and state-optimal for that class. We introduce a
key technique called a ""fixed resolution clock"" to achieve partial
synchronization.
  Our protocol is *nonuniform*: the transition function has the value $\left
\lceil {\log n} \right \rceil$ encoded in it. We show that the protocol can be
modified to be uniform, while increasing the state complexity to $\Theta(\log n
\log \log n)$.

that draw upon the content of 3D models of urban scenes. Such 3D models can be
used to visualize city images at multiple scales from individual buildings to
entire cities prior to and after a change has occurred. This ability is of
great importance in day-to-day work and special projects undertaken by
planners, geo-designers, and architects. In this research, we implemented a
novel approach to 3D building models for such matter, which included the
integration of geographic information systems (GIS) and 3D Computer Graphics
(3DCG) components that generate 3D house models from building footprints
(polygons), and the automated generation of simple and complex roof geometries
for rapid roof area damage reporting. These polygons (footprints) are usually
orthogonal. A complicated orthogonal polygon can be partitioned into a set of
rectangles. The proposed GIS and 3DCG integrated system partitions orthogonal
building polygons into a set of rectangles and places rectangular roofs and
box-shaped building bodies on these rectangles. Since technicians are drawing
these polygons manually with digitizers, depending on aerial photos, not all
building polygons are precisely orthogonal. But, when placing a set of boxes as
building bodies for creating the buildings, there may be gaps or overlaps
between these boxes if building polygons are not precisely orthogonal. In our
proposal, after approximately orthogonal building polygons are partitioned and
rectified into a set of mutually orthogonal rectangles, each rectangle knows
which rectangle is adjacent to and which edge of the rectangle is adjacent to,
which will avoid unwanted intersection of windows and doors when building
bodies combined.

x(n), we prove that the output of this system is equivalent to computing the
first order derivative of x(n). Further, with some constraints on the impulse
response, the system output is also equivalent to the second order derivative.
With this, we show that a fine edge detection in an image can be achieved using
CCPSs as impulse response over Ramanujan Sums (RSs). Later computation of
projection for CCS is studied. Here the projection matrix has a circulant
structure, which makes the computation of projections easier. Finally, we prove
that CCS is shift-invariant and closed under the operation of circular
cross-correlation.
