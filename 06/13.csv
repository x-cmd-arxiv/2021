first contribution is a mathematical framework for redirected walking using

highlights various geometric and perceptual constraints that tend to make
collision-free redirected walking difficult. We use our framework to propose an
efficient solution to the redirection problem that uses the notion of
visibility polygons to compute the free spaces in the physical environment and
the virtual environment. The visibility polygon provides a concise
representation of the entire space that is visible, and therefore walkable, to
the user from their position within an environment. Using this representation
of walkable space, we apply redirected walking to steer the user to regions of
the visibility polygon in the physical environment that closely match the
region that the user occupies in the visibility polygon in the virtual

determine the most suitable ML technique to disentangle a hypothetical
supersymmetry signal from its corresponding Standard Model (SM) backgrounds and
to establish their impact on signal significance. The study focuses on the
production of SUSY top squark pairs (stops), in the mass range of
$500<m_{\tilde{t}_1}<800$ GeV, from proton-proton collisions with a center of
mass energy of 13 TeV and an integrated luminosity of 150 fb$^{-1}$, emulating
the data-taking conditions of the run II LHC accelerator. In particular, the
semileptonic channel is analyzed, corresponding to final states with a single
isolated lepton (electron or muon), missing transverse energy, and four jets,
with at least one tagged as $b$-jet. The challenging compressed spectra region
is targeted, where the stop decays mainly into a $W$ boson, a $b$-jet, and a
neutralino ($\tilde{t}_1\rightarrow W+b+\tilde{\chi}_1^0$), with a mass gap
between the stop and the neutralino of about 150 GeV. The ML algorithms are
chosen to cover different mathematical implementations and features in machine
learning. We compare the performance of a logistic regression (LR), a Random

indicate that all four algorithms provide an improvement in signal significance

asserts that it is impossible to store broadband waves (large

i.e., vibrations, in particular, this limit takes on a simple form, {\Delta}t
{\Delta}{\omega} = 1, where {\Delta}{\omega} is the bandwidth over which
localization occurs, and {\Delta}t is the storage time. It remains a
fundamental challenge in classical wave physics and vibration engineering to
try to find ways to overcome this limit, not least because that would allow for
storing broadband waves for long times, or achieve broadband resonance for low
damping. Recent theoretical studies have suggested that such a feat might be
possible in LTI terminated unidirectional waveguides or LTI topological
'rainbow trapping' devices, although an experimental confirmation of either

achieving values, both, above and below unity, in an energy-tunable way. Our
proposed structure consists of a single degree-of-freedom nonlinear oscillator,

to disproportionally decrease (increase) {\Delta}t, the storage time in the

filters adopted by the survey; it also depends on the ability to perform rapid
follow-up observations to confirm the nature of the transients. In this work,
we assess kilonova detectability in existing simulations of the LSST strategy
for the Vera C. Rubin Wide Fast Deep survey, with focus on comparing rolling to
baseline cadences. Although currently available cadences can enable the
detection of more than 300 kilonovae out to 1400 Mpc over the ten-year survey,
we can expect only 3-32 kilonovae similar to GW170817 to be recognizable as
fast-evolving transients. We also explore the detectability of kilonovae over
the plausible parameter space, focusing on viewing angle and ejecta masses. We
find that observations in redder izy bands are crucial for identification of
nearby (within 300 Mpc) kilonovae that could be spectroscopically classified
more easily than more distant sources. Rubin's potential for serendipitous
kilonova discovery could be increased by gain of efficiency with the employment
of individual 30s exposures (as opposed to 2x15s snap pairs), with the addition

a kind of text multi-label classification problem, which is difficult because
the number of labels is very large and the distribution of labels is

coding because it can assign weights to every word in full Electronic Medical
Records (EMR) for different ICD codes. However, the label-wise attention
mechanism is computational redundant and costly. In this paper, we propose a
pseudo label-wise attention mechanism to tackle the problem. Instead of
computing different attention modes for different ICD codes, the pseudo
label-wise attention mechanism automatically merges similar ICD codes and
computes only one attention mode for the similar ICD codes, which greatly
compresses the number of attention modes and improves the predicted accuracy.
In addition, we apply a more convenient and effective way to obtain the ICD
vectors, and thus our model can predict new ICD codes by calculating the
similarities between EMR vectors and ICD vectors. Extensive experiments show
the superior performance of our model. On the public MIMIC-III dataset and
private Xiangya dataset, our model achieves micro f1 of 0.583 and 0.806,

learning problems due to their monotonic performance-improvement guarantee at
every iteration. Nonetheless, when applied in multi-agent settings, the
guarantee of trust region methods no longer holds because an agent's payoff is
also affected by other agents' adaptive behaviors. To tackle this problem, we
conduct a game-theoretical analysis in the policy space, and propose a
multi-agent trust region learning method (MATRL), which enables trust region
optimization for multi-agent learning. Specifically, MATRL finds a stable
improvement direction that is guided by the solution concept of Nash
equilibrium at the meta-game level. We derive the monotonic improvement
guarantee in multi-agent settings and empirically show the local convergence of
MATRL to stable fixed points in the two-player rotational differential game. To
test our method, we evaluate MATRL in both discrete and continuous multiplayer
general-sum games including checker and switch grid worlds, multi-agent MuJoCo,

the luminosity weighted stellar metallicity in an extensive catalog of

evolution models (ChEM), considering that galaxies with different stellar mass

and with different protocols in a clinical study, is a fundamental hurdle for
accurate prediction using machine learning models, as such models often fail to
generalize well. This paper leverages a recently proposed
normalizing-flow-based method to perform counterfactual inference upon a
structural causal model (SCM), in order to achieve harmonization of such data.
A causal model is used to model observed effects (brain magnetic resonance
imaging data) that result from known confounders (site, gender and age) and
exogenous noise variables. Our formulation exploits the bijection induced by
flow for the purpose of harmonization. We infer the posterior of exogenous
variables, intervene on observations, and draw samples from the resultant SCM
to obtain counterfactuals. This approach is evaluated extensively on multiple,
large, real-world medical datasets and displayed better cross-domain
generalization compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. Further experiments
that evaluate the quality of confounder-independent data generated by our model
using regression and classification tasks are provided.

from its corresponding low-resolution version, is a spatial-temporal sequence
prediction problem. Recently, Transformer has been gaining popularity due to
its parallel computing ability for sequence-to-sequence modeling. Thus, it
seems to be straightforward to apply the vision Transformer to solve VSR.
However, the typical block design of Transformer with a fully connected
self-attention layer and a token-wise feed-forward layer does not fit well for
VSR due to the following two reasons. First, the fully connected self-attention
layer neglects to exploit the data locality because this layer relies on linear
layers to compute attention maps. Second, the token-wise feed-forward layer
lacks the feature alignment which is important for VSR since this layer
independently processes each of the input token embeddings without any
interaction among them. In this paper, we make the first attempt to adapt
Transformer for VSR. Specifically, to tackle the first issue, we present a
spatial-temporal convolutional self-attention layer with a theoretical
understanding to exploit the locality information. For the second issue, we
design a bidirectional optical flow-based feed-forward layer to discover the
correlations across different video frames and also align features. Extensive
experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed method. The code will be available at

Unmasking the effect of the magnetic field, we furthermore demonstrate that the

computed tomography (4DCT) of lungs and are caused by missing, duplicated, and
misaligned image data. This paper presents a geodesic density regression (GDR)
algorithm to correct motion artifacts in 4DCT by correcting artifacts in one
breathing phase with artifact-free data from corresponding regions of other
breathing phases. The GDR algorithm estimates an artifact-free lung template
image and a smooth, dense, 4D (space plus time) vector field that deforms the
template image to each breathing phase to produce an artifact-free 4DCT scan.
Correspondences are estimated by accounting for the local tissue density change
associated with air entering and leaving the lungs, and using binary artifact
masks to exclude regions with artifacts from image regression. The
artifact-free lung template image is generated by mapping the artifact-free
regions of each phase volume to a common reference coordinate system using the
estimated correspondences and then averaging. This procedure generates a fixed
view of the lung with an improved signal-to-noise ratio. The GDR algorithm was
evaluated and compared to a state-of-the-art geodesic intensity regression
(GIR) algorithm using simulated CT time-series and 4DCT scans with clinically
observed motion artifacts. The simulation shows that the GDR algorithm has
achieved significantly more accurate Jacobian images and sharper template
images, and is less sensitive to data dropout than the GIR algorithm. We also
demonstrate that the GDR algorithm is more effective than the GIR algorithm for
removing clinically observed motion artifacts in treatment planning 4DCT scans.

different biological conditions including cancers. However, RNA-seq experiments
are still small sample size experiments due to the cost. Recently, an increased
focus has been on meta-analysis methods for integrated differential expression
analysis for exploration of potential biomarkers. In this study, we propose a
p-value combination method for meta-analysis of multiple related RNA-seq
studies that accounts for sample size of a study and direction of expression of
genes in individual studies. The proposed method generalizes the inverse-normal
method without increase in computational complexity and does not pre- or
post-hoc filter genes that have conflicting direction of expression in
different studies. Thus, the proposed method, as compared to the
inverse-normal, has better potential for the discovery of differentially
expressed genes (DEGs) with potentially conflicting differential signals from
multiple studies related to disease. We demonstrated the use of the proposed
method in detection of biologically relevant DEGs in glioblastoma (GBM), the
most aggressive brain cancer. Our approach notably enabled the identification
of over-expression in GBM compared to healthy controls of the oncogene RAD51,
which has recently been shown to be a target for inhibition to enhance
radiosensitivity of GBM cells during treatment. Pathway analysis identified
multiple aberrant GBM related pathways as well as novel regulators such as
TCF7L2 and MAPT as important upstream regulators in GBM. The proposed method
provides a way to establish differential expression status for genes with
conflicting direction of expression in individual RNA-seq studies. Hence,
leading to further exploration of them as potential biomarkers for the disease.

are either represented in a native vector format or rasterized to produce fixed
resolution images. In the first case, the non-standard representation prevents
benefiting from latest network architectures for neural representations; while,
in the latter case, the rasterized representation, when encoded via networks,
results in loss of data fidelity, as font-specific discontinuities like edges
and corners are difficult to represent using neural networks. Based on the
observation that complex fonts can be represented by a superposition of a set
of simpler occupancy functions, we introduce \textit{multi-implicits} to
represent fonts as a permutation-invariant set of learned implict functions,
without losing features (e.g., edges and corners). However, while
multi-implicits locally preserve font features, obtaining supervision in the
form of ground truth multi-channel signals is a problem in itself. Instead, we
propose how to train such a representation with only local supervision, while
the proposed neural architecture directly finds globally consistent
multi-implicits for font families. We extensively evaluate the proposed
representation for various tasks including reconstruction, interpolation, and
synthesis to demonstrate clear advantages with existing alternatives.
Additionally, the representation naturally enables glyph completion, wherein a
single characteristic font is used to synthesize a whole font family in the
target style.

Studying and replicating the ants' house hunting behavior will also illuminate
useful distributed strategies that have evolved in nature. Many of the existing
models of househunting behaviour for T. albipennis make the assumption that all
candidate nest sites are equally distant from the ants' home nest, or that an
ant has an equal probability of finding each candidate nest site. However,
realistically this is not the case, as nests that are further away from the
home nest and nests that are difficult to access are less likely to be found,
even if they are of higher quality. We extend previous house-hunting models to
account for a pairwise distance metric between nests, compare our results to
those of real colonies, and use our results to examine the effects of house
hunting in nests of different spatial orientations. Our incorporation of
distances in the ant model appear to match empirical data in situations where a
distance-quality tradeoff between nests is relevant. Furthermore, the model
continues to be on par with previous house-hunting models in experiments where
all candidate nests are equidistant from the home nest, as is typically

bears the key to decode the writings of quantum mechanics in a vast variety of

its role as a basic model of quantum mechanics, the hydrogen atom provides a
fundamental building block of quantum information. Through its electron and
nuclear spin degrees of freedom, the hydrogen atom is shown to lend a
physically meaningful frame and a suitable Hilbert space for bipartite
entanglement, whose two-qubit concurrence and quantum coherence can be
expressed in terms of the fundamental physical constants -- the Planck and
Boltzmann constants, electron and proton masses, the fine-structure constant,
as well as the Bohr radius and the Bohr magneton. The intrinsic, natural
entanglement that the hyperfine-structure (HFS) states of the H atom store at
low temperatures rapidly decreases with a growth in temperature, vanishing
above a $\tau_c$ $\approx$ 5.35 $\mu$eV threshold. An external magnetic field,
however, can overcome this thermal loss of HFS entanglement. As one of the
central findings of this work, we show that an external magnetic field can
induce and sustain an HFS entanglement, against all the odds of thermal
effects, at temperatures well above the $\tau_c$ threshold, thus enabling
magnetic-field-assisted entanglement engineering in low-temperature gases and

research of graph machine learning (ML) has a wide spectrum of applications

infeasible in real-world scenarios since labeled data for newly emerged

meta-learning has been applied to different few-shot graph learning problems,
most existing efforts predominately assume that all the data from those seen

seen data is weakly-labeled with severe label noise. As such, we aim to
investigate a novel problem of weakly-supervised graph meta-learning for
improving the model robustness in terms of knowledge transfer. To achieve this
goal, we propose a new graph meta-learning framework -- Graph Hallucination

training, Meta-GHN is meta-learned to hallucinate clean node representations
from weakly-labeled data and extracts highly transferable meta-knowledge, which
enables the model to quickly adapt to unseen tasks with few labeled instances.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Meta-GHN over existing

associated with many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), each with small or
moderate effect sizes. Second, our understanding of the functional mechanisms
through which genetic variants are associated with complex traits is still
limited. To address these challenges, we propose GPA-Tree and it simultaneously
implements association mapping and identifies key combinations of functional
annotations related to risk-associated SNPs by combining a decision tree
algorithm with a hierarchical modeling framework. Results: First, we
implemented simulation studies to evaluate the proposed GPA-Tree method and
compared its performance with existing statistical approaches. The results
indicate that GPA-Tree outperforms existing statistical approaches in detecting
risk-associated SNPs and identifying the true combinations of functional
annotations with high accuracy. Second, we applied GPA-Tree to a systemic lupus

blood immune cells, including but not limited to primary B, memory helper T,

demonstrate that GPA-Tree can be a powerful tool that improves association
mapping while facilitating understanding of the underlying genetic architecture

complex traits.

Since many problems in machine learning and other areas are both

data efficient representation of visual information. Visual information is
acquired in the form of events that are triggered by local brightness changes.
Each pixel location of the camera's sensor records events asynchronously and
independently with very high temporal resolution. However, because most
brightness changes are triggered by relative motion of the camera and the
scene, the events recorded at a single sensor location seldom correspond to the
same world point. To extract meaningful information from event cameras, it is
helpful to register events that were triggered by the same underlying world
point. In this work we propose a new model of event data that captures its
natural spatio-temporal structure. We start by developing a model for aligned
event data. That is, we develop a model for the data as though it has been
perfectly registered already. In particular, we model the aligned data as a
spatio-temporal Poisson point process. Based on this model, we develop a
maximum likelihood approach to registering events that are not yet aligned.
That is, we find transformations of the observed events that make them as
likely as possible under our model. In particular we extract the camera
rotation that leads to the best event alignment. We show new state of the art
accuracy for rotational velocity estimation on the DAVIS 240C dataset. In
addition, our method is also faster and has lower computational complexity than
several competing methods.

technology for big data analytics. GPUs are extremely popular accelerators for

to accelerate TADOC. We describe G-TADOC, the first framework that provides
GPU-based text analytics directly on compression, effectively enabling
efficient text analytics on GPUs without decompressing the input data. G-TADOC
solves three major challenges. First, TADOC involves a large amount of
dependencies, which makes it difficult to exploit massive parallelism on a GPU.
We develop a novel fine-grained thread-level workload scheduling strategy for
GPU threads, which partitions heavily-dependent loads adaptively in a
fine-grained manner. Second, in developing G-TADOC, thousands of GPU threads
writing to the same result buffer leads to inconsistency while directly using
locks and atomic operations lead to large synchronization overheads. We develop
a memory pool with thread-safe data structures on GPUs to handle such
difficulties. Third, maintaining the sequence information among words is
essential for lossless compression. We design a sequence-support strategy,
which maintains high GPU parallelism while ensuring sequence information. Our
experimental evaluations show that G-TADOC provides 31.1x average speedup

attacks. In the underlying distributed system, a number of unknown but
malicious workers (termed as Byzantine workers) can send arbitrary messages to
the master and bias the learning process, due to data corruptions, computation
errors or malicious attacks. Prior work has considered a total variation (TV)
norm-penalized approximation formulation to handle the Byzantine attacks, where
the TV norm penalty forces the regular workers' local variables to be close,
and meanwhile, tolerates the outliers sent by the Byzantine workers. To solve
the TV norm-penalized approximation formulation, we propose a Byzantine-robust
stochastic alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) that fully
utilizes the separable problem structure. Theoretically, we prove that the
proposed method converges to a bounded neighborhood of the optimal solution at
a rate of O(1/k) under mild assumptions, where k is the number of iterations

probability of existing derived from some prediction. Algorithms must probe
edges to determine existence and match them irrevocably if they exist. Further,
each vertex may have a patience constraint denoting how many of its neighboring

distribution, and a loss function, we specify the generalized posterior
distribution. The problem of frequentist posterior consistency is concerned
with whether as more and more samples are observed, the posterior distribution
on parameters will asymptotically concentrate on the ""right"" parameters. We
show that posterior consistency can be derived using a combination of classical
large deviation techniques, such as Varadhan's lemma, conditional/quenched
large deviations, annealed large deviations, and exponential approximations. We
show that the posterior distribution will asymptotically concentrate on
parameters that minimize the expected loss and a divergence term, and we
identify the divergence term as the Donsker-Varadhan relative entropy rate from
process-level large deviations. As an application, we prove new quenched and
annealed large deviation asymptotics and new Bayesian posterior consistency
results for a class of mixing stochastic processes. In the case of Markov
processes, one can obtain explicit conditions for posterior consistency,
whenever estimates for log-Sobolev constants are available, which makes our
framework essentially a black box. We also recover state-of-the-art posterior

  Robust Divergence",,,,,"stat.ME stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce a methodology for robust Bayesian estimation with robust
divergence (e.g., density power divergence or {\gamma}-divergence), indexed by
a single tuning parameter. It is well known that the posterior density induced
by robust divergence gives highly robust estimators against outliers if the
tuning parameter is appropriately and carefully chosen. In a Bayesian
framework, one way to find the optimal tuning parameter would be using evidence
(marginal likelihood). However, we numerically illustrate that evidence induced
by the density power divergence does not work to select the optimal tuning
parameter since robust divergence is not regarded as a statistical model. To
overcome the problems, we treat the exponential of robust divergence as an
unnormalized statistical model, and we estimate the tuning parameter via
minimizing the Hyvarinen score. We also provide adaptive computational methods
based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers, which enables us to obtain the
optimal tuning parameter and samples from posterior distributions
simultaneously. The empirical performance of the proposed method through
simulations and an application to real data are also provided.

  Behavior Sequence via Hierarchical Grouping",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  E-commerce companies have to face abnormal sellers who sell potentially-risky
products. Typically, the risk can be identified by jointly considering product
content (e.g., title and image) and seller behavior. This work focuses on
behavior feature extraction as behavior sequences can provide valuable clues
for the risk discovery by reflecting the sellers' operation habits. Traditional
feature extraction techniques heavily depend on domain experts and adapt poorly
to new tasks. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised method InfoBehavior
to automatically extract meaningful representations from ultra-long raw
behavior sequences instead of the costly feature selection procedure.
InfoBehavior utilizes Bidirectional Transformer as feature encoder due to its
excellent capability in modeling long-term dependency. However, it is
intractable for commodity GPUs because the time and memory required by
Transformer grow quadratically with the increase of sequence length. Thus, we
propose a hierarchical grouping strategy to aggregate ultra-long raw behavior
sequences to length-processable high-level embedding sequences. Moreover, we
introduce two types of pretext tasks. Sequence-related pretext task defines a
contrastive-based training objective to correctly select the masked-out
coarse-grained/fine-grained behavior sequences against other ""distractor""
behavior sequences; Domain-related pretext task designs a classification
training objective to correctly predict the domain-specific statistical results
of anomalous behavior. We show that behavior representations from the
pre-trained InfoBehavior can be directly used or integrated with features from
other side information to support a wide range of downstream tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that InfoBehavior significantly improves the
performance of Product Risk Management and Intellectual Property Protection.

of scanner vendors, imaging protocols, etc. This raises the concern about the
generalization capacity of machine learning models. Domain generalization (DG),
which aims to learn a model from multiple source domains such that it can be
directly generalized to unseen test domains, seems particularly promising to
medical imaging community. To address DG, recent model-agnostic meta-learning
(MAML) has been introduced, which transfers the knowledge from previous
training tasks to facilitate the learning of novel testing tasks. However, in
clinical practice, there are usually only a few annotated source domains
available, which decreases the capacity of training task generation and thus
increases the risk of overfitting to training tasks in the paradigm. In this
paper, we propose a novel DG scheme of episodic training with task augmentation
on medical imaging classification. Based on meta-learning, we develop the
paradigm of episodic training to construct the knowledge transfer from episodic
training-task simulation to the real testing task of DG. Motivated by the
limited number of source domains in real-world medical deployment, we consider
the unique task-level overfitting and we propose task augmentation to enhance
the variety during training task generation to alleviate it. With the
established learning framework, we further exploit a novel meta-objective to
regularize the deep embedding of training domains. To validate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, we perform experiments on
histopathological images and abdominal CT images.

approximations. The Coulomb direct ionization contributions is studied by (i)
the relativistic semi-classical approximations (RSCA), (ii) the shellwise local

inclusion of the vacancy sharing among the subshells by the coupled-states

equilibrium condition. Then, we study the equilibrium properties of this

leakage is, the shorter the time required for H+ and lactose to reach

when cotransport is performed at constant initial particle concentration, the
time for cytoplasm pH to be stabilized increases monotonically with the

performance. To overcome the over-fitting issue, we proposed an adaptive
dynamic pruning approach for FL, which can dynamically slim the model by
dropping out unimportant parameters, hence, preventing over-fittings. Since the
machine learning model's parameters react differently for different training
samples, adaptive dynamic pruning will evaluate the salience of the model's
parameter according to the input training sample, and only retain the salient
parameter's gradients when doing back-propagation. We performed comprehensive
experiments to evaluate our approach. The results show that our approach by
removing the redundant parameters in neural networks can significantly reduce
the over-fitting issue and greatly improves the training efficiency. In
particular, when training the ResNet-32 on CIFAR-10, our approach reduces the
communication cost by 57\%. We further demonstrate the inference acceleration
capability of the proposed algorithm. Our approach reduces up to 50\% FLOPs
inference of DNNs on edge devices while maintaining the model's quality.

  Networks for Conversational Speech Recognition","6 pages, 5 figures, Accepted to APSIPA ASC 2021",,,,"cs.CL eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  How to effectively incorporate cross-utterance information cues into a neural
language model (LM) has emerged as one of the intriguing issues for automatic
speech recognition (ASR). Existing research efforts on improving
contextualization of an LM typically regard previous utterances as a sequence
of additional input and may fail to capture complex global structural
dependencies among these utterances. In view of this, we in this paper seek to
represent the historical context information of an utterance as
graph-structured data so as to distill cross-utterances, global word
interaction relationships. To this end, we apply a graph convolutional network
(GCN) on the resulting graph to obtain the corresponding GCN embeddings of
historical words. GCN has recently found its versatile applications on
social-network analysis, text summarization, and among others due mainly to its
ability of effectively capturing rich relational information among elements.
However, GCN remains largely underexplored in the context of ASR, especially
for dealing with conversational speech. In addition, we frame ASR N-best
reranking as a prediction problem, leveraging bidirectional encoder
representations from transformers (BERT) as the vehicle to not only seize the
local intrinsic word regularity patterns inherent in a candidate hypothesis but
also incorporate the cross-utterance, historical word interaction cues
distilled by GCN for promoting performance. Extensive experiments conducted on
the AMI benchmark dataset seem to confirm the pragmatic utility of our methods,
in relation to some current top-of-the-line methods.

and lab-scale processes, ranging from enhanced oil recovery to drug delivery
systems. In this work, we investigate propelling microdroplets that form from
liquid-liquid phase separation in a quasi-2D chamber, focusing on the direction
and speed of microdroplets in response to local composition gradients. The
confined ternary solution in our experiments comprises a model oil, a good
solvent (ethanol) and a poor solvent (water). Depending on the initial solution
composition, water-rich or oil-rich microdroplets, form and move spontaneously
as the ternary solution mixes with and is displaced by water diffusing from a
deep side channel. Microdroplet movement is followed in situ using high-speed
bright-field imaging or fluorescence imaging when the solution is doped with a
dye. Local ethanol composition gradients are estimated from the variation of
fluorescence intensity in the local continuous liquid surrounding the mobile
microdroplets. From phase separation of the ternary solution with high oil
concentration, mobile oil-rich microdroplets form in a water-rich zone,
accompanying the formation of water-rich microdroplets in an oil-rich zone. The
fast movement of oil-rich microdroplets induces directional flow transport that
mobilizes water-rich microdroplets close to the water-rich zone. The average
microdroplet speed increases with the initial oil concentration in the ternary
solution. The fastest speed of oil-rich microdroplets observed in our
experiments is ~150 ${\mu}$m/s along the surface of a hydrophobic wall. The
presence of a sharp ethanol composition gradient is the primary driving force
for the fast movement of oil-rich microdroplets in confinement. Our results
demonstrate the potential of enhancing liquid transport in confinement through
composition gradients arising from phase separation.

Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. In the LLG equation, the length of
magnetization is conserved and the system energy is dissipative. Implicit and
semi-implicit schemes have been used in micromagnetics simulations due to their
unconditional numerical stability. In more details, implicit schemes preserve
the properties of the LLG equation, but solve a nonlinear system of equations
per time step. In contrast, semi-implicit schemes only solve a linear system of
equations, while additional operations are needed to preserve the length of
magnetization. It still remains unclear which one shall be used if both
implicit and semi-implicit schemes are available. In this work, using the
implicit Crank-Nicolson (ICN) scheme as a benchmark, we propose to make this
implicit scheme semi-implicit. It can be proved that both schemes are
second-order accurate in space and time. For the unique solvability of
nonlinear systems of equations in the ICN scheme, we require that the temporal
step size scales quadratically with the spatial mesh size. It is numerically
verified that the convergence of the nonlinear solver becomes slower for larger
temporal step size and multiple magnetization profiles are obtained for
different initial guesses. The linear systems of equations in the semi-implicit
CN (SICN) scheme are unconditionally uniquely solvable, and the condition that
the temporal step size scales linearly with the spatial mesh size is needed in
the convergence of the SICN scheme. In terms of numerical efficiency, the SICN
scheme achieves the same accuracy as the ICN scheme with less computational
time. Based on these results, we conclude that a semi-implicit scheme is
superior to its implicit analog both theoretically and numerically, and we
recommend the semi-implicit scheme in micromagnetics simulations if both

unsupervised representation learning. Existing methods focus on distinguishing
different video clips by visual and audio representations. We human visual
perception could attend to regions where sounds are made, and our auditory
perception could also ground their frequencies of sounding objects, which we
call bidirectional local correspondence. Such supervision is intuitive but not
well explored in the contrastive learning framework. This paper introduces a
pretext task, Cross-Modal Attention Consistency (CMAC), for exploring the
bidirectional local correspondence property. The CMAC approach aims to align
the regional attention generated purely from the visual signal with the target
attention generated under the guidance of acoustic signal, and do a similar
alignment for frequency grounding on the acoustic attention. Accompanied by a
remoulded cross-modal contrastive loss where we consider additional
within-modal interactions, the CMAC approach works effectively for enforcing
the bidirectional alignment. Extensive experiments on six downstream benchmarks
demonstrate that CMAC can improve the state-of-the-art performance on both
visual and audio modalities.

alleviate energy consumption of sensors by responding to users' data requests
with the data packets cached in the edge caching node (ECN). However, without
an efficient status update strategy, the information obtained by users may be
stale, which in return would inevitably deteriorate the accuracy and
reliability of derived decisions for real-time applications. In this paper, we
focus on striking the balance between the information freshness, in terms of
age of information (AoI), experienced by users and energy consumed by sensors,
by appropriately activating sensors to update their current status.
Particularly, we first depict the evolutions of the AoI with each sensor from
different users' perspective with time steps of non-uniform duration, which are
determined by both the users' data requests and the ECN's status update
decision. Then, we formulate a non-uniform time step based dynamic status
update optimization problem to minimize the long-term average cost, jointly
considering the average AoI and energy consumption. To this end, a Markov
Decision Process is formulated and further, a dueling deep R-network based
dynamic status update algorithm is devised by combining dueling deep Q-network
and tabular R-learning, with which challenges from the curse of dimensionality
and unknown of the environmental dynamics can be addressed. Finally, extensive
simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed
algorithm by comparing it with five baseline deep reinforcement learning

  The AutoScore-Survival-derived scoring model was more parsimonious than
survival models built using traditional variable selection methods (e.g.,
penalized likelihood approach and stepwise variable selection), and its
performance was comparable to survival models using the same set of variables.
Although AutoScore-Survival achieved a comparable integrated area under the

Different levels of coarse-graining are evaluated: at first, we compare the
results in the underdamped dynamics with those in the overdamped one (first
coarse-graining). For large values of the viscosity, the two dynamics have the
same energetic properties, while, for smaller viscosity values, the overdamped
approximation produces an excess of entropy production with respect to that of
the underdamped dynamics. Moreover, for further smaller values of the drag
coefficient, the excess of entropy production turns into a loss. These regimes
are explained by evaluating the jump statistics, observing that the inertia is
able to induce multiple jumps and affect the average jump rate. The periodic
shape of the potential allows us to approximate the continuous dynamics via a
Markov chain, after the introduction of a suitable time and space
discretization (second level of coarse-graining). This discretization procedure
is implemented starting both from the underdamped and the overdamped evolution
and is analyzed for different values of the viscosity.

results show that the local principal variation corresponds to the semantic
factorization and traversing along it provides strong robustness to image
traversal. Moreover, we suggest an explanation for the limited success in
finding the global traversal directions in the latent space, especially W-space
of StyleGAN2. We show that W-space is warped globally by comparing the local

feature and global glimpse vector exported from the encoder. 2) The feature
enriched glimpse vector produced by the Multi-Head General Attention is used to
assist the RNN iteration and the character prediction at each time step.

holes held apart by a thin distribution of matter on the axis joining the
holes. For all such spacetimes, the Einstein field equations are integrated
with an energy-momentum tensor that does not include a contribution from the
axial matter; the presence of this matter is inferred instead from the
existence of a conical singularity in the spacetime. And for all such
spacetimes, the axial matter is characterized by a pressure (or tension) equal
to its linear energy density; the matter is therefore revealed to have a very
specific equation of state. Our purpose with this paper is to show that the
axial matter can be introduced at the very start of the exercise, through the
specification of a distributional energy-momentum tensor, and that one can
choose for it any equation of state. To evade no-go theorems regarding line
sources in general relativity, we retreat to a perturbative expansion of the
gravitational field, using the Schwarzschild metric as a description of the
background spacetime. Instead of a second black hole, our prototypical system
features a point particle at a fixed position outside the Schwarzschild black
hole, attached to a string extending to infinity. This matter is described in
terms of a distributional energy-momentum tensor, and we examine different
equations of state for the string. To integrate the field equations we
introduce a new ""Weyl"" gauge for the metric perturbation, which allows us to
find closed-form expressions for the gravitational potentials. Our solutions
are linearized versions of multi-hole spacetimes, and some of them feature
strings with a varying tension, unequal to the energy density. We describe the

raw waveform into time-frequency representations, which is more amenable to
process with well-established image processing pipelines. Prior methods also
detect in segment-wise manner, leading to incomplete and partial detections.
SoundDet takes a novel approach and directly consumes the raw, multichannel
waveform and treats the spatio-temporal sound event as a complete
""sound-object"" to be detected. Specifically, SoundDet consists of a backbone
neural network and two parallel heads for temporal detection and spatial
localization, respectively. Given the large sampling rate of raw waveform, the
backbone network first learns a set of phase-sensitive and frequency-selective
bank of filters to explicitly retain direction-of-arrival information, whilst
being highly computationally and parametrically efficient than standard 1D/2D
convolution. A dense sound event proposal map is then constructed to handle the
challenges of predicting events with large varying temporal duration.
Accompanying the dense proposal map are a temporal overlapness map and a motion
smoothness map that measure a proposal's confidence to be an event from
temporal detection accuracy and movement consistency perspective. Involving the
two maps guarantees SoundDet to be trained in a spatio-temporally unified
manner. Experimental results on the public DCASE dataset show the advantage of
SoundDet on both segment-based and our newly proposed event-based evaluation

transfer across two immiscible phases. When this transfer takes place in the
form of evaporation of a binary solution with one component being more volatile
than the other, gradients in surface tension can arise. These gradients can
ultimately destabilise the liquid-gas interface. In the present work, we study
the evaporation of an ethanol-water solution, for which ethanol has a larger
volatility. The solution is contained in a horizontal Hele-Shaw cell which is
open from one end to allow for evaporation into air. A Marangoni instability is
then triggered at the liquid-air interface. We study the temporal evolution of
this instability by observing the effects that it has on the bulk of the
liquid. More specifically, the growth of convective cells is visualized with
confocal microscopy and the velocity field close to the interface is measured
with micro-particle-image-velocimetry. The results of numerical simulations
based on quasi 2D equations satisfactorily compare with the experimental
observations, even without consideration of evaporative cooling, although this
cooling can play an extra role in experiments. Furthermore, a linear stability
analysis applied to a simplified version of the quasi 2D equations showed
reasonably good agreement with the results from simulations at early times,
when the instability has just been triggered and no coarsening has taken place.
In particular, we find a critical Marangoni number below which a regime of
stability is predicted.

method (NLHD). The unique low-frequency coefficient of Haar transform on each
similar pixel group is used to reconstruct the illumination component, and the
rest of all high-frequency coefficients are employed to reconstruct the
reflectance component. The complete similarity of pixels in a matched similar
pixel group and the simple separable Haar transform help to obtain more
appropriate image decomposition; thus, the image is hardly sharpened in the
image brightness enhancement procedure. The exponential transform and
logarithmic transform are respectively implemented on the illumination
component. Then a minimum fusion strategy on the results of these two
transforms is utilized to achieve more natural illumination component
enhancement. It can alleviate the mosaic artifacts produced in the darker
regions by the exponential transform with a gamma value less than 1 and reduce
information loss caused by excessive enhancement of the brighter regions due to
the logarithmic transform. Finally, the Retinex model is applied to the
enhanced illumination and reflectance to achieve image enhancement. We also
develop a local noise level estimation based noise suppression method and a
non-local saturation reduction based color deviation correction method. These

have obtained from the fully 3D structure of our sensor. Against previous
sensors which all have used EGaIn as the conductive material of their sensor,
we have used low-cost, safe, and ubiquitous glycol-based gel instead. To show
the functionality of the proposed sensor some FEM simulations, a set of the
designed experimental tests were done which showed the linear, accurate, and
durable operation of the proposed sensor. Finally, the sensor was put through
its paces on the knee, elbow, and wrist of a female test subject. Also, to
evaluate the pressure functionality of the sensor, a fully 3D active foot
insole was developed, fabricated, and evaluated. All of the results show
promising features for the proposed sensor to be used in real-world
applications like rehabilitation, wearable devices, soft robotics, smart
clothing, gait analysis, AR/VR, etc.

attention in the AI community due to its ability to generate high-quality data

game between two neural networks trained in an adversarial manner to reach a
zero-sum Nash equilibrium profile. Despite the improvement accomplished in GANs
in the last few years, several issues remain to be solved. This paper reviews
the literature on the game theoretic aspects of GANs and addresses how game
theory models can address specific challenges of generative model and improve
the GAN's performance. We first present some preliminaries, including the basic
GAN model and some game theory background. We then present taxonomy to classify
state-of-the-art solutions into three main categories: modified game models,
modified architectures, and modified learning methods. The classification is
based on modifications made to the basic GAN model by proposed game-theoretic
approaches in the literature. We then explore the objectives of each category
and discuss recent works in each category. Finally, we discuss the remaining
challenges in this field and present future research directions.

work, a novel approach is presented to extract acoustic propagation-based
features to automatically highlight the region below pleura, which is an
important landmark in lung ultrasound (LUS). Subsequently, a multichannel input
formed by using the acoustic physics-based feature maps is fused to train a
neural network, referred to as LUSNet, to classify the LUS images into five
classes of varying severity of lung infection to track the progression of
COVID-19. In order to ensure that the proposed approach is agnostic to the type
of acquisition, the LUSNet, which consists of a U-net architecture is trained
in an unsupervised manner with the acoustic feature maps to ensure that the
encoder-decoder architecture is learning features in the pleural region of
interest. A novel combination of the U-net output and the U-net encoder output
is employed for the classification of severity of infection in the lung. A
detailed analysis of the proposed approach on LUS images over the infection to

five-fold cross-validation accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 97%, 93%,

learn a transferable feature embedding network by estimating the similarities

we propose, for the first time, to introduce the non-linear data projection
concept into the design of FSFGIC architecture in order to address the limited
sample problem in few-shot learning and at the same time to increase the
discriminability of the model for fine-grained image classification.
Specifically, we first design a feature re-abstraction embedding network that
has the ability to not only obtain the required semantic features for effective
metric learning but also re-enhance such features with finer details from input
images. Then the descriptors of the query images and the support classes are
projected into different non-linear spaces in our proposed similarity metric
learning network to learn discriminative projection factors. This design can
effectively operate in the challenging and restricted condition of a FSFGIC
task for making the distance between the samples within the same class smaller
and the distance between samples from different classes larger and for reducing
the coupling relationship between samples from different categories.
Furthermore, a novel similarity measure based on the proposed non-linear data
project is presented for evaluating the relationships of feature information
between a query image and a support set. It is worth to note that our proposed
architecture can be easily embedded into any episodic training mechanisms for
end-to-end training from scratch. Extensive experiments on FSFGIC tasks
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods over the state-of-the-art

autoregressive distribution estimation where the features can occur in an
arbitrary order, is a challenging problem in generative machine learning. Prior
work on OADE has encoded feature identity by assigning each feature to a
distinct fixed position in an input vector. As a result, architectures built
for these inputs must strategically mask either the input or model weights to
learn the various conditional distributions necessary for inferring the full
joint distribution of the dataset in an order-agnostic way. In this paper, we
propose an alternative approach for encoding feature identities, where each
feature's identity is included alongside its value in the input. This feature
identity encoding strategy allows neural architectures designed for sequential
data to be applied to the OADE task without modification. As a proof of
concept, we show that a Transformer trained on this input (which we refer to as
""the DEformer"", i.e., the distribution estimating Transformer) can effectively
model binarized-MNIST, approaching the performance of fixed-order
autoregressive distribution estimating algorithms while still being entirely
order-agnostic. Additionally, we find that the DEformer surpasses the
performance of recent flow-based architectures when modeling a tabular dataset.

$\overline{\mbox{DR}}$ and OS renormalisation in the top/stop sector. For the
treatment of the infrared divergences we apply and compare three different
regularisation methods: the introduction of a regulator mass, the application
of a small momentum expansion, and the inclusion of the full momentum
dependence. Our new corrections have been implemented in the Fortran code
NMSSMCALC that computes the Higgs mass spectrum of the CP-conserving and
CP-violating NMSSM as well as the Higgs boson decays including the
state-of-the-art higher-order corrections. Our numerical analysis shows that
the newly computed corrections increase with rising $\lambda$ and $\kappa$,
remaining overall below about 3\% compared to our previously computed ${\cal
O}(\alpha_t(\alpha_t+\alpha_s))$ corrections, in the region compatible with
perturbativity below the GUT scale. The renormalisation scheme and scale
dependence is of typical two-loop order. The impact of the CP-violating phases
in the new corrections is small. We furthermore show that the Goldstone Boson
Catastrophe due to the infrared divergences can be treated in a numerically
efficient way by introducing a regulator mass that approximates the
momentum-dependent results best for squared mass values in the permille range
of the squared renormalisation scale. Our results mark another step forward in
the program of increasing the precision in the NMSSM Higgs boson observables.

correction methods explore improving filters to estimate the noise-free

sign-symbols of noise, resulting in artifacts (\textit{i.e.}, arbitrary signal

water depth are studied in the context of potential flow theory. This solution
provides explicit expressions for the surface elevation, free-surface velocity
potential and velocity potential. The amplitude dispersion relation is also
provided. Two approaches are used to derive the third order analytical
solution, resulting in two types of approximate solutions: the perturbation
solution and the Hamiltonian solution. The perturbation solution is obtained by
classical perturbation technique in which the time variable is expanded in
multiscale to eliminate secular terms. The Hamiltonian solution is derived from
the canonical transformation in the Hamiltonian theory of water waves. By
comparing the two types of solutions, it is found that they are completely
equivalent for the first to second order solutions and the nonlinear
dispersion, but for the third order part only the sum-sum terms are the same.
Due to the canonical transformation that could completely separate the dynamic
and bound harmonics, the Hamiltonian solutions break through the difficulty
that the perturbation theory breaks down due to singularities in the transfer
functions when quartet resonance criterion is satisfied. Furthermore, it is
also found that some time-averaged quantities based on the Hamiltonian
solution, such as mean potential energy and mean kinetic energy, are equal to
those in the initial state in which sea surface is assumed to be a Gaussian
random process. This is because there are associated conserved quantities in
the Hamiltonian form. All of these show that the Hamiltonian solution is more
reasonable and accurate to describe the third order steady-state wave field.
Finally, based on the Hamiltonian solution, some statistics are given such as
the volume flux, skewness, and excess kurtosis.

particles settled on a shallow concave dish under a temporally oscillating
magnetic field. The system reaches a stationary state where the energy losses
from collisions and friction with the concave dish surface are compensated by
the continuous energy input coming from the oscillating magnetic field. Random
particle motions show some similarities with the motions of atoms and molecules
in a glass or a crystal-forming fluid. Because of the curvature of the surface,
particles experience an additional force toward the center of the concave dish.
When decreasing the magnetic field, the effective temperature is decreased and
diffusive particle motion slows. For slow cooling rates we observe
crystallization, where the particles organize into a hexagonal lattice. We
study the birth of the crystalline nucleus and the subsequent growth of the
crystal. Our observations support non-classical theories of crystal formation.
Initially a dense amorphous aggregate of particles forms, and then in a second
stage this aggregate rearranges internally to form the crystalline nucleus. As
the aggregate grows, the crystal grows in its interior. After a certain size,
all the aggregated particles are part of the crystal and after that, crystal
growth follows the classical theory for crystal growth.

Challenge on Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD). The dataset is
based on emulation of real recordings of static or moving sound events under
real conditions of reverberation and ambient noise, using spatial room impulse
responses captured in a variety of rooms and delivered in two spatial formats.
The acoustical synthesis remains the same as in the previous iteration of the
challenge, however the new dataset brings more challenging conditions of
polyphony and overlapping instances of the same class. The most important
difference of the new dataset is the introduction of directional interferers,
meaning sound events that are localized in space but do not belong to the
target classes to be detected and are not annotated. Since such interfering
events are expected in every real-world scenario of SELD, the new dataset aims
to promote systems that deal with this condition effectively. A modified
SELDnet baseline employing the recent ACCDOA representation of SELD problems
accompanies the dataset and it is shown to outperform the previous one. The new
dataset is shown to be significantly more challenging for both baselines
according to all considered metrics. To investigate the individual and combined
effects of ambient noise, interferers, and reverberation, we study the
performance of the baseline on different versions of the dataset excluding or
including combinations of these factors. The results indicate that by far the
most detrimental effects are caused by directional interferers.

downlink of a hybrid aerial-terrestrial network, where the backhaul links are
subject to beamforming misalignment errors. In the proposed model, the user

differentiate between two transmission schemes according to the backhaul

backhaul links are good or not. In the other scheme, the UAVs are aware of the
backhaul links status, and hence, only the subset of successfully backhauled

dimer, we observe a double resonance in the condensation efficiency that arises
from tuning the condensate-reservoir detuning in to resonance with either the
symmetric or antisymmetric mode. This selective condensation was also exploited
in the dimerised chain, to condense the system into the topological edge states
under homogeneous pumping of all cavities. We also showed an interesting
signature of nonreciprocal transport when pumping a single cavity in the chain,
where the direction of propagation depends on the sublattice being pumped.

human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1,

related animal coronaviruses including SARS-Bat-CoV, MERS-Camel-CoV, MHV,
Bat-CoV MOP1, TGEV, and one of camel alphacoronaviruses. RNAPS in the genomes
of coronaviruses were evolved due to weakly specific interactions between
genomic RNA and N proteins in helical nucleocapsids. Combining transitional
genome mapping and Jaccard correlation coefficients allows us to perform the
analysis directly in terms of underlying motifs distributed over the genome. In
all coronaviruses RNAPS were distributed quasi-periodically over the genome
with the period about 54 nt biased to 57 nt and to 51 nt for the genomes longer

experimentally verified packaging signals for MERS-CoV, MHV, and TGEV proved
that the distribution of particular motifs is strongly correlated with the
packaging signals. We also found that many motifs were highly conserved in both
characters and positioning on the genomes throughout the lineages that make
them promising therapeutic targets. The mechanisms of encapsidation can affect
the recombination and co-infection as well.

extensively. While point process-based generative models have long been in use
for estimating cascade growths, deep learning has greatly enhanced diverse
feature integration. We observe two significant temporal signals in cascade
data that have not been emphasized or reported to our knowledge. First, the
popularity of the cascade root is known to influence cascade size strongly; but
the effect falls off rapidly with time. Second, there is a measurable positive
correlation between the novelty of the root content (with respect to a
streaming external corpus) and the relative size of the resulting cascade.
Responding to these observations, we propose GammaCas, a new cascade growth
model as a parametric function of time, which combines deep influence signals
from content (e.g., tweet text), network features (e.g., followers of the root
user), and exogenous event sources (e.g., online news). Specifically, our model
processes these signals through a customized recurrent network, whose states
then provide the parameters of the cascade rate function, which is integrated
over time to predict the cascade size. The network parameters are trained

the vector of the energy flux and the anisotropy of the mutual friction force.
We suggest an approximate analytic solution of the resulting energy-rate
equation, which is fully supported by the numerical solution. The
two-dimensional energy spectrum is strongly confined in the direction of the
counterflow velocity. In agreement with the experiment, the energy spectra in
the direction orthogonal to the counterflow exhibit two scaling ranges: a
near-classical non-universal cascade-dominated range and a universal critical
regime at large wavenumbers. The theory predicts the dependence of various
details of the spectra and the transition to the universal critical regime on
the flow parameters.

spatial information. However, no one cares for the cue of sound onset, which
has been emphasized in the auditory scene analysis and psychology. Inspired by

speaker extraction task. We further extended to the onset/offset cues and got
performance improvement. From the perspective of tasks, our onset/offset-based

voiceprint with onset/offset cues. Voiceprint models voice characteristics of
the target while onset/offset models the start/end information of the speech.
From the perspective of auditory scene analysis, the combination of two

derive the median luminosity to halo mass relation, $L_{c}(M_{h})$ for both
quasars and galaxies under the assumption of log-normal luminosity scatter,
$\Sigma_{Q}$ and $\Sigma_{G}$. We show that higher $\Sigma_{Q}$ reduces the
average halo mass hosting a quasar of a given luminosity, thus introducing at
least a partial reversion to the mean in the number count distribution of
nearby Lyman-Break galaxies. We generate a large sample of mock Hubble Space
Telescope fields-of-view centred across rare $z\sim6$ quasars by resampling
pencil beams traced through the dark matter component of the BlueTides
cosmological simulation. We find that diverse quasar environments are expected
for $\Sigma_{Q}>0.4$, consistent with numerous observations and theoretical
studies. However, we note that the average number of galaxies around the
central quasar is primarily driven by galaxy evolutionary processes in
neighbouring halos, as embodied by our parameter $\Sigma_{G}$, instead of a
difference in the large scale structure around the central quasar host,
embodied by $\Sigma_{Q}$. We conclude that models with $\Sigma_{G}>0.3$ are
consistent with current observational constraints on high-z quasars, and that
such a value is comparable to the scatter estimated from hydrodynamical

extraction, the sensitive information of camera fingerprint and PRNU noise is
distributed into multiple obfuscated shares using Shamir secret sharing(SSS)

understanding of crystal momentum in photonic systems. We investigate the
origin of this flaw and propose a continuous-folded band structure as the
rectification. Based on the proposed continuous-folded photonic band structure,
a bound state in the continuum (BIC) is actually below the light line, similar
to the conventional guided modes. We present the condition for the boundedness
of photonic modes and verify the effectiveness of our condition via two
photonic crystal slabs with resonance-trapped BIC and symmetry-protected BIC,
respectively. In the second case, our condition of boundedness correctly
indicates a radiative mode, which satisfies the condition of symmetry-protected
BIC.

equation is reinvestigated in perspective of geometry. With the help of theorem
proved by Gu $et~al.$, we construct a convenient variational basis set, which
emphasizes the geometric characteristics of trial wavefuncions. The main
advantage of this basis is that the angular part is complete for natural $L$
states with $L + 1$ terms and for unnatural $L$ states with $L$ terms, where
$L$ is the total angular quantum number. Compared with basis sets which contain
three Euler angles, this basis is very simple to use. More importantly, this
basis is quite easy to be generalized to more particle systems.

convolutional neural networks because of its lightweight nature. The proposed
network named Dual Multi Scale Attention Network (DMSANet) is comprised of two
parts: the first part is used to extract features at various scales and
aggregate them, the second part uses spatial and channel attention modules in
parallel to adaptively integrate local features with their global dependencies.
We benchmark our network performance for Image Classification on ImageNet

  Users",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.DC cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Fine-grained location prediction on smart phones can be used to improve
app/system performance. Application scenarios include video quality adaptation
as a function of the 5G network quality at predicted user locations, and
augmented reality apps that speed up content rendering based on predicted user
locations. Such use cases require prediction error in the same range as the GPS
error, and no existing works on location prediction can achieve this level of
accuracy. We present a system for fine-grained location prediction (FGLP) of
mobile users, based on GPS traces collected on the phones. FGLP has two
components: a federated learning framework and a prediction model. The
framework runs on the phones of the users and also on a server that coordinates
learning from all users in the system. FGLP represents the user location data
as relative points in an abstract 2D space, which enables learning across
different physical spaces. The model merges Bidirectional Long Short-Term
Memory (BiLSTM) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), where BiLSTM learns
the speed and direction of the mobile users, and CNN learns information such as
user movement preferences. FGLP uses federated learning to protect user privacy
and reduce bandwidth consumption. Our experimental results, using a dataset
with over 600,000 users, demonstrate that FGLP outperforms baseline models in
terms of prediction accuracy. We also demonstrate that FGLP works well in
conjunction with transfer learning, which enables model reusability. Finally,
benchmark results on several types of Android phones demonstrate FGLP's
feasibility in real life.

wireless power transfer (WPT) as it is capable of beamforming and beam focusing
without using active and power-hungry components. In this paper, we propose a
multi-tile RIS beam scanning (MTBS) algorithm for powering up
internet-of-things (IoT) devices. Considering the hardware limitations of the
IoT devices, the proposed algorithm requires only power information to enable
the beam focusing capability of the RIS. Specifically, we first divide the RIS
into smaller RIS tiles. Then, all RIS tiles and the phased array transmitter
are iteratively scanned and optimized to maximize the receive power. We
elaborately analyze the proposed algorithm and build a simulator to verify it.
Furthermore, we have built a real-life testbed of RIS-aided WPT systems to
validate the algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed MTBS
algorithm can properly control the transmission phase of the transmitter and
the reflection phase of the RIS to focus the power at the receiver.
Consequently, after executing the algorithm, about 20 dB improvement of the
receive power is achieved compared to the case that all unit cells of the RIS
are in OFF state. By experiments, we confirm that the RIS with the MTBS
algorithm can greatly enhance the power transfer efficiency.

  method",,,,,"cond-mat.soft physics.app-ph q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Besides the advantages of Ionic polymer-metal composites (IPMCs) for
biomedical applications, there are some drawbacks in their performance, which
can be enhanced. One of those critical drawbacks is ""back relaxation"" (BR). If
we apply a step voltage to IPMC, it will bend in the anode direction.
Afterward, there is an unwanted and relatively slow counter-bending toward the
cathode side. There are some disadvantages in the current BR control methods of
IPMC actuators that prevent them from being used in real applications. This
paper presents a new non-feedback method for eliminating the BR effect of
non-patterned IPMCs by using a relatively high-frequency disturbance and
proving it by theoretical and experimental explanations. The results show that
the proposed method, needless to have any pattern on the electrodes of the
IPMCs, can significantly eliminate the BR effect. Unlike the patterned IPMCs,
no reduction will occur in the bending amplitude of IPMC, and even we can see
the increased bending amplitude.

The security video surveillance system is a powerful means to prevent violence
and crimes, and it is closely coupled with the construction of smart cities. A
post-project evaluation is an evaluation of a project's actions and outcomes
after its completion. Post-project evaluation can scientifically and
objectively evaluate the construction effectiveness of video surveillance
system at a certain stage. Utilizing post-project evaluation can find out the
causes of success or failure to make recommendations for the construction of a
security video surveillance system in the next stage. Therefore, we propose a
fuzzy post-project evaluation approach for the security video surveillance
system in a real-world community. The fuzzy theory and fuzzy multi-level
evaluation method are applied. The evaluation result demonstrates that the
proposed approach is practically applicable to real-world security video
surveillance systems.

in 3GPP mobile networks, that provides two security capabilities. The first
capability, called authentication, is to cryptographically assert that a mobile
phone or a network is indeed who it claims to be, and the second capability,
called key agreement, is to put necessary cryptographic keys in place for
protection of traffic between the mobile phone and the network. Jointly, these
two capabilities lay the foundation of secure 3GPP mobile networks. From 2G-5G,
there are eight main versions of AKA, details of which are spread over and
embedded deep in multiple technical specifications. It is getting increasingly
difficult to quickly check a certain property of a certain AKA, let alone grasp
the full picture of all AKAs. Therefore, I have prepared cheatsheets for all
AKA versions and listed their main properties. I hope these will benefit
university students, security researchers, and 3GPP standardization community.
I welcome any corrections and feedback.
