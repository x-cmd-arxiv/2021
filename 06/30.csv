eigenvalues, is a key diagnostic of many-body quantum chaos. In addition,
partial spectral form factors (PSFFs) can be defined which refer to subsystems
of the many-body system. They provide unique insights into energy eigenstate
statistics of many-body systems, as we show in an analysis on the basis of
random matrix theory and of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We
propose a protocol that allows the measurement of the SFF and PSFFs in quantum
many-body spin models, within the framework of randomized measurements. Aimed
to probe dynamical properties of quantum many-body systems, our scheme employs
statistical correlations of local random operations which are applied at
different times in a single experiment. Our protocol provides a unified testbed
to probe many-body quantum chaotic behavior, thermalization and many-body
localization in closed quantum systems which we illustrate with numerical
simulations for Hamiltonian and Floquet many-body spin-systems.

sophisticated Bell tests that continued to refute local hidden variable

increasingly compelling experimental evidence against the Extended
Church-Turing thesis. In this direction, continued competition between upgraded
quantum hardware and improved classical simulations is required. Here, we
report a new GBS experiment that produces up to 113 detection events out of a
144-mode photonic circuit. We develop a new high-brightness and scalable
quantum light source, exploring the idea of stimulated squeezed photons, which
has simultaneously near-unity purity and efficiency. This GBS is programmable
by tuning the phase of the input squeezed states. We demonstrate a new method
to efficiently validate the samples by inferring from computationally friendly
subsystems, which rules out hypotheses including distinguishable photons and

nonclassicality test using an inequality, and we reveal non-trivial genuine
high-order correlation in the GBS samples, which are evidence of robustness

expansion of technology, some people are deliberately using social media

Christchurch mosque shootings or hate crimes against Asians in west, it has
been observed that the convicts are very much influenced from hate text present

key challenges is to reduce the false positive rate (marking non hate as hate),
so that these systems can detect hate speech without undermining the freedom of

analyze the performance of hate speech detection classifier by replacing or
integrating the word embeddings (fastText (FT), GloVe (GV) or FT + GV) with
static BERT embeddings (BE). With the extensive experimental trails it is
observed that the neural network performed better with static BE compared to
using FT, GV or FT + GV as word embeddings. In comparison to fine-tuned BERT,
one metric that significantly improved is specificity.

efficiently estimate the posterior distributions of the buck parameters subject
to gross errors in the prior distributions of the parameters. The proposed

applications and for 3D-scanned material, such as is used in autonomous
driving, architecture, and engineering, to model real estate for renovation or

such as color. Be the color unique or direction-dependent (in the case of
plenoptic point clouds), it reflects the colors observed by cameras displaced
around the object. Hence, not only are the viewing references assumed, but the
illumination spectrum and illumination geometry is also implicit. We propose a
model-centric description of the 3D object, that is independent of the
illumination and of the position of the cameras. We want to be able to describe
the objects themselves such that, at a later stage, the rendering of the model
may decide where to place illumination, from which it may calculate the image
viewed by a given camera. We want to be able to describe transparent or
translucid objects, mirrors, fishbowls, fog and smoke. Volumetric clouds may
allow us to describe the air, however ``empty'', and introduce air particles,
in a manner independent of the viewer position. For that, we rely on some
eletromagnetic properties to arrive at seven attributes per voxel that would
describe the material and its color or transparency. Three attributes are for
the transmissivity of each color, three are for the attenuation of each color,
and another attribute is for diffuseness. These attributes give information
about the object to the renderer, with whom lies the decision on how to render

triangular geometry and apply it to classify the localizing tensor-ideals of
certain categories of spectral $G$-Mackey functors for all finite groups $G$.
Our theory of stratification is based on the approach of Stevenson which uses
the Balmer-Favi notion of big support for tensor-triangulated categories whose
Balmer spectrum is weakly noetherian. We clarify the role of the
local-to-global principle and establish that the Balmer-Favi notion of support
provides the universal approach to weakly noetherian stratification. This
provides a uniform new perspective on existing classifications in the
literature and clarifies the relation with the theory of Benson-Iyengar-Krause.
Our systematic development of this approach to stratification, involving a
reduction to local categories and the ability to pass through finite \'{e}tale
extensions, may be of independent interest. Moreover, we strengthen the
relationship between stratification and the telescope conjecture. The starting
point for our equivariant applications is the recent computation by
Patchkoria-Sanders-Wimmer of the Balmer spectrum of the category of derived
Mackey functors, which was found to capture precisely the height $0$ and height
$\infty$ chromatic layers of the spectrum of the equivariant stable homotopy
category. We similarly study the Balmer spectrum of the category of
$E(n)$-local spectral Mackey functors noting that it bijects onto the height
$\le n$ chromatic layers of the spectrum of the equivariant stable homotopy
category; conjecturally the topologies coincide. Despite our incomplete
knowledge of the topology of the Balmer spectrum, we are able to completely
classify the localizing tensor-ideals of these categories of spectral Mackey
functors.

quantitative evaluation of unauthentic groups, particularly discovering that
social bots changed the natural dynamics of the network in these days, but did

the tidal velocity and the mean shear associated with the convective flow. In a
recent response, Barker and Astoul (2021, hereafter BA21) claim to show that

  Goal-Oriented Visual Dialogue",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Building an interactive artificial intelligence that can ask questions about
the real world is one of the biggest challenges for vision and language
problems. In particular, goal-oriented visual dialogue, where the aim of the
agent is to seek information by asking questions during a turn-taking dialogue,
has been gaining scholarly attention recently. While several existing models
based on the GuessWhat?! dataset have been proposed, the Questioner typically
asks simple category-based questions or absolute spatial questions. This might
be problematic for complex scenes where the objects share attributes or in
cases where descriptive questions are required to distinguish objects. In this
paper, we propose a novel Questioner architecture, called Unified Questioner
Transformer (UniQer), for descriptive question generation with referring
expressions. In addition, we build a goal-oriented visual dialogue task called
CLEVR Ask. It synthesizes complex scenes that require the Questioner to
generate descriptive questions. We train our model with two variants of CLEVR
Ask datasets. The results of the quantitative and qualitative evaluations show
that UniQer outperforms the baseline.

results indicate that TMG model with a quintessential dark energy is more
compatible with the low redshift measurements of large scale structures by
predicting a lower value for the structure growth parameter $\sigma_8$ with

alleviate the $\sigma_8$ tension.

powerful abstraction for designing complex concurrent programs. Since they are
not always available, they are typically substituted with software
implementations. A prominent condition relating these implementations to their
atomic specifications is linearizability, which preserves safety properties of
the programs using them. However linearizability does not preserve
hyper-properties, which include probabilistic guarantees of randomized
programs: an adversary can greatly amplify the probability of a bad outcome.
This unwelcome behavior prevents modular reasoning, which is the key benefit
provided by the use of linearizable object implementations. A more restrictive
property, strong linearizability, does preserve hyper-properties but it is
impossible to achieve in many situations.
  This paper suggests a novel approach to blunting the adversary's additional
power that works even in cases where strong linearizability is not achievable.
We show that a wide class of linearizable implementations, including well-known
ones for registers and snapshots, can be modified to approximate the
probabilistic guarantees of randomized programs when using atomic objects. The
technical approach is to transform the algorithm of each method of an existing
linearizable implementation by repeating a carefully chosen prefix of the
method several times and then randomly choosing which repetition to use
subsequently. We prove that the probability of a bad outcome decreases with the
number of repetitions, approaching the probability attained when using atomic
objects. The class of implementations to which our transformation applies
includes the ABD implementation of a shared register using message-passing and
the Afek et al. implementation of an atomic snapshot using single-writer
registers.

correctly determined effective parameters are necessary for accurate modeling
and simulation of various applications. To describe single-fluid-phase flows in
coupled free-flow and porous-medium systems, the Stokes/Darcy equations are
typically used together with the conservation of mass across the interface, the
balance of normal forces and the Beavers-Joseph condition on the tangential
velocity. The latter condition is suitable for flows parallel to the interface
but not applicable for arbitrary flow directions. Moreover, the value of the
Beavers-Joseph slip coefficient is uncertain. In the literature, it is
routinely set equal to one that is not correct for many applications, even if
the flow is parallel to the porous layer. In this paper, we reformulate the
generalized interface condition on the tangential velocity component, recently
developed for arbitrary flows in Stokes/Darcy systems, such that it has the
same analytical form as the Beavers-Joseph condition. We compute the effective
coefficients appearing in this modified condition using theory of
homogenization with boundary layers. We demonstrate that the modified
Beavers-Joseph condition is applicable for arbitrary flow directions to the
fluid-porous interface. In addition, we propose an efficient two-level

closed form solution that satisfies optimality and safety conditions. The
proposed solution is shown to be continuous and thus it renders the safe set

revolution by shallow dimples is presented by using the high-fidelity Reynolds
Stress Modeling based simulations. Experimental results of drag evolution from
published literature at different Reynolds numbers are used to validate the
model predictions. The numerical predictions show good agreement with the
experimental results. It is observed that the drag of the body is reduced by a
maximum of $31\%$ with such shape modification (for the depth to diameter ratio
of $7.5\%$ and coverage ratio of $52.8\%$). This arises due to the reduced
level of turbulence, flow stabilization and suppression of flow separation in
the boundary layer of the body. From the analysis of turbulence states in the
anisotopic invariant map (AIM) for the case of the dimpled body, we show that
the turbulence reaches an axisymmetric limit in the layers close to the surface
of the body. There is also a reduced misalignment between the mean flow
direction and principal axis of the Reynolds stress tensor, which results in
such drag reduction. The dimple depth to diameter and coverage ratio are also
varied to evaluate its effect on drag evolution.

  Introduction","15 pages",,,,"quant-ph cs.OH math-ph math.MP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Tensor product operators on finite dimensional Hilbert spaces are studied.
The focus is on bilinear tensor product operators. A tensor product operator on
a pair of Hilbert spaces is a maximally general bilinear operator into a target
Hilbert space. By 'maximally general' is meant every bilinear operator from the
same pair of spaces to any Hilbert space factors into the composition of the
tensor product operator with a uniquely determined linear mapping on the target
space. There are multiple distinct tensor product operators of the same type;
there is no ""the"" tensor product. Distinctly different tensor product operators
can be associated with different parts of a multipartite system without
difficulty. Separability of states, and locality of operators and observables
is tensor product operator dependent. The same state in the target state space
can be inseparable with respect to one tensor product operator but separable
with respect to another, and no tensor product operator is distinguished
relative to the others; the unitary operator used to construct a Bell state
from a pair of |0>'s being highly tensor product operator-dependent is a prime
example. The relationship between two tensor product operators of the same type
is given by composition with a unitary operator. There is an equivalence
between change of tensor product operator and change of basis in the target
space. Among the gains from change of tensor product operator is the
localization of some nonlocal operators as well as separability of inseparable
states. Examples are given.

become more homogeneous over the course of development, the contact-induced
signals to the cells increase beyond a critical value to trigger coordinated

interstellar medium. But the phase of the interstellar medium from which the
CRs are extracted has remained elusive until now. Here, we study in detail the
GCR source composition deduced from recent measurements by the AMS-02, Voyager
1 and SuperTIGER experiments to obtain information on the composition,
ionisation state and dust content of the GCR source reservoirs. We show that
the volatile elements of the CR material are mainly accelerated from a plasma
of temperature higher than $\sim 2$ MK, which is typical of the hot medium
found in galactic superbubbles energised by the activity of massive star winds
and supernova explosions. Another GCR component, which is responsible for the
overabundance of $^{22}$Ne, most likely arises from acceleration of massive
star winds in their termination shocks. From the CR-related $\gamma$-ray
luminosity of the Milky Way, we estimate that the ion acceleration efficiency
in both supernova shocks and wind termination shocks is of the order of
$10^{-5}$. The GCR source composition also shows evidence for a preferential
acceleration of refractory elements contained in interstellar dust. We suggest
that the GCR refractories are also produced in superbubbles, from shock
acceleration and subsequent sputtering of dust grains continuously incorporated
into the hot plasma through thermal evaporation of embedded molecular clouds.
Our model explains well the measured abundances of all primary and mostly
primary CRs from H to Zr, including the overabundance of $^{22}$Ne.

a model population of multiple-planet systems with low mutual inclinations
(${\sim1^{\circ}-2^{\circ}}$) adequately describes the multiple-transiting
systems but underpredicts the number of single-transiting systems. This
so-called ""Kepler dichotomy"" signals the existence of a sub-population of
multi-planet systems possessing larger mutual inclinations. However, the
details of these inclinations remain uncertain. In this work, we derive
constraints on the intrinsic mutual inclination distribution by statistically
exploiting Transit Duration Variations (TDVs) of the Kepler planet population.
When planetary orbits are mutually inclined, planet-planet interactions cause
orbital precession, which can lead to detectable long-term changes in transit
durations. These TDV signals are inclination-sensitive and have been detected
for roughly two dozen Kepler planets. We compare the properties of the Kepler
observed TDV detections to TDV detections of simulated planetary systems
constructed from two population models with differing assumptions about the
mutual inclination distribution. We find strong evidence for a continuous
distribution of relatively low mutual inclinations that is well-characterized
by a power law relationship between the median mutual inclination
($\tilde{\mu}_{i,n}$) and the intrinsic multiplicity ($n$): $\tilde{\mu}_{i,n}
= \tilde{\mu}_{i,5}(n/5)^{\alpha}$, where $\tilde{\mu}_{i,5} =
1.10^{+0.15}_{-0.11}$ and $\alpha = -1.73^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$. These results
suggest that late-stage planet assembly and possibly stellar oblateness are the
dominant physical origins for the excitation of Kepler planet mutual
inclinations.

their consideration of potential negative consequences, and their institutional

it has this particular property. In this work, we introduce a new and fresh
perspective on flatness of modules. However, we will first investigate a more

call these domains $\x$-precover completing domains. In particular, when $\x$

This approach allows us to provide a common frame for a number of classical

increasing seen as a viable alternative to general-purpose RANS closures, when
LES reference data is available -- also in wind-energy. Parsimonious closures
with few, simple terms have advantages in terms of stability,
interpret-ability, and execution speed. However experience suggests that
closure model corrections need be made only in limited regions -- e.g.\ in the
near-wake of wind turbines and not in the majority of the flow. A parsimonious
model therefore must find a middle ground between precise corrections in the
wake, and zero corrections elsewhere. We attempt to resolve this impasse by
introducing a classifier to identify regions needing correction, and only fit
and apply our model correction there. We observe that such a classifier (which
must be computed only from RANS-available quantities) is straightforward to
construct, and accurate in operation. We further observe that the correction
models are significantly simpler (with fewer terms) when limited to the
identified regions than otherwise, but have similar or better accuracy. We
apply our framework to three flows consisting of multiple wind-turbines in

  Constructions","Significantly simplify the formalism of the unified framework.
  Reorganize the application section of the framework. Abstract shorten to meet
  Arxiv limit",,,,"cs.CG cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Seminal works on light spanners over the years provide spanners with optimal
lightness in various graph classes, such as in general graphs, Euclidean
spanners, and minor-free graphs. Three shortcomings of previous works on light
spanners are: (1) The techniques are ad hoc per graph class, and thus can't be
applied broadly. (2) The runtimes of these constructions are almost always
sub-optimal, and usually far from optimal. (3) These constructions are optimal
in the standard and crude sense, but not in a refined sense that takes into
account a wider range of involved parameters.
  This work aims at addressing these shortcomings by presenting a unified
framework of light spanners in a variety of graph classes. Informally, the
framework boils down to a transformation from sparse spanners to light
spanners; since the state-of-the-art for sparse spanners is much more advanced
than that for light spanners, such a transformation is powerful. Our framework
is developed in two papers. The current paper is the first of the two -- it
lays the basis of the unified framework and then applies it to design fast
constructions with optimal lightness for several graph classes.
  Among various applications and implications of our framework, we highlight
here the following:
  _ In low-dimensional Euclidean spaces, we present an $O(n\log n)$-time
construction of $(1+\epsilon)$-spanners with lightness and degree both bounded
by constants in the algebraic computation tree (ACT). Our construction resolves
a major problem in the area of geometric spanners, which was open for three
decades.
  _ In general graphs, for any $k \geq 2$, we construct a
$(2k-1)(1+\epsilon)$-spanner with lightness $O(n^{1/k})$ in $O(m \alpha(m,n))$
time. This result for light spanners in general weighted graphs is surprising,
as it outperforms the analog one for sparse spanners.

that a unique ground truth is known and can be used for performance evaluation.
This is true for many applications, but not all. Myocardial segmentation of
Myocardial Contrast Echocardiography (MCE), a critical task in automatic
myocardial perfusion analysis, is an example. Due to the low resolution and
serious artifacts in MCE data, annotations from different cardiologists can
vary significantly, and it is hard to tell which one is the best. In this case,
how can we find a good way to evaluate segmentation performance and how do we
train the neural network? In this paper, we address the first problem by
proposing a new extended Dice to effectively evaluate the segmentation
performance when multiple accepted ground truth is available. Then based on our
proposed metric, we solve the second problem by further incorporating the new
metric into a loss function that enables neural networks to flexibly learn
general features of myocardium. Experiment results on our clinical MCE data set
demonstrate that the neural network trained with the proposed loss function
outperforms those existing ones that try to obtain a unique ground truth from
multiple annotations, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Finally, our
grading study shows that using extended Dice as an evaluation metric can better
identify segmentation results that need manual correction compared with using
Dice.

in a CP and baryon number violating way inside the bubble. The particles are

the third Sakharov condition is easily met. Washout is avoided provided the
reheat temperature is sufficiently below the scale of the heavy particles. The
mechanism relies on moderate supercooling and relativistic walls which -- in
contrast to electroweak baryogenesis -- generically leads to a sizable
gravitational wave signal, although in the simplest realisations at frequencies
beyond upcoming detectors. We present a simple example model and discuss the
restrictions on the parameter space for the mechanism to be successful. We find
that high reheat temperatures $T_{\rm RH} \gtrsim 10^{10}$ GeV are generally

increased precision in observations, future surveys will also access the
ultra-large-scale regime, where commonly neglected effects such as lensing,
redshift-space distortions and relativistic corrections become important for
calculating correlation functions of galaxy positions. At the same time,
several approximations usually made in these calculations, such as the Limber
approximation, break down at those scales. The need to abandon these
approximations and simplifying assumptions at large scales creates severe
issues for parameter estimation methods. On the one hand, exact calculations of
theoretical angular power spectra become computationally expensive, and the
need to perform them thousands of times to reconstruct posterior probability
distributions for cosmological parameters makes the approach unfeasible. On the
other hand, neglecting relativistic effects and relying on approximations may
significantly bias the estimates of cosmological parameters. In this work, we
quantify this bias and investigate how an incomplete modelling of various
effects on ultra-large scales could lead to false detections of new physics
beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Furthermore, we propose a simple
debiasing method that allows us to recover true cosmologies without running the
full parameter estimation pipeline with exact theoretical calculations. This
method can therefore provide a fast way of obtaining accurate values of
cosmological parameters and estimates of exact posterior probability

to learn a good initialization for model parameters that can help solve unseen

Although successful in practice, theoretical understanding of such methods is
limited. This work studies an important aspect of these methods: splitting the
data from each task into train (support) and validation (query) sets during
meta-training. Inspired by recent work (Raghu et al., 2020), we view such
meta-learning methods through the lens of representation learning and argue
that the train-validation split encourages the learned representation to be
low-rank without compromising on expressivity, as opposed to the non-splitting
variant that encourages high-rank representations. Since sample efficiency
benefits from low-rankness, the splitting strategy will require very few

compare results obtained from different APOGEE data releases and using two

highlight selection biases and mechanisms not included in the model. The thin
disc exhibits a flat age-metallicity relation while [$\alpha$/Fe] increases
with stellar age. We confirm no correlation between radial and vertical

Considering both samples, V$_\varphi$ decreases with age for the thin disc,
while it increases with age for the h$\alpha$mp thick disc. Although the age
distribution of the h$\alpha$mr thick disc is very close to that of the
h$\alpha$mp thick disc between 7 and 14 Gyr, its kinematics seems to follow
that of the thin disc. This feature, not predicted by the hypotheses included

Finally, we show that there is a maximum dispersion of the vertical velocity,
$\sigma_Z$, with age for the h$\alpha$mp thick disc around 8 Gyr. The
comparisons with the BGM simulations suggest a more complex chemo-dynamical
scheme to explain this feature, most likely including mergers and radial
migration effects

theories of galaxy evolution. The widespread usage of human classifiers to
visually assess whether galaxies are in merging systems remains a fundamental
component of many morphology studies. Studies that employ human classifiers
usually construct a control sample, and rely on the assumption that the bias
introduced by using humans will be evenly applied to all samples. In this work,
we test this assumption and develop methods to correct for it. Using the
standard binomial statistical methods employed in many morphology studies, we
find that the merger fraction, error, and the significance of the difference
between two samples are dependent on the intrinsic merger fraction of any given
sample. We propose a method of quantifying merger biases of individual human
classifiers and incorporate these biases into a full probabilistic model to
determine the merger fraction and the probability of an individual galaxy being
in a merger. Using 14 simulated human responses and accuracies, we are able to
correctly label a galaxy as ''merger'' or ''isolated'' to within 1\% of the
truth. Using 14 real human responses on a set of realistic mock galaxy
simulation snapshots our model is able to recover the pre-coalesced merger
fraction to within 10\%. Our method can not only increase the accuracy of
studies probing the merger state of galaxies at cosmic noon, but also can be
used to construct more accurate training sets in machine learning studies that

resistivity that is either exactly zero (implying it supports dissipationless
current) or nonzero. Exactly zero resistivity is related to conservation laws
that prevent the current from degrading. In this paper, we carefully examine
the situations in which such a circumstance can occur. We find that exactly
zero resistivity requires either continuous translation symmetry, or an
internal symmetry that has a certain kind of ""mixed anomaly"" with the electric
charge. (The symmetry could be a generalized global symmetry associated with
the emergence of unbreakable loop or higher dimensional excitations.) However,
even if one of these is satisfied, we show that there is still a mechanism to
get nonzero resistivity, through critical fluctuations that drive the
susceptibility of the conserved quantity to infinity; we call this mechanism
""critical drag"". Critical drag is thus a mechanism for resistivity that, unlike
conventional mechanisms, is unrelated to broken symmetries. We furthermore
argue that an emergent symmetry that has the appropriate mixed anomaly with
electric charge is in fact an inevitable consequence of compressibility in
systems with lattice translation symmetry. Critical drag therefore seems to be
the only way (other than through irrelevant perturbations breaking the emergent
symmetry, that disappear at the renormalization group fixed point) to get
nonzero resistivity in such systems. Finally, we present a very simple and
concrete model -- the ""Quantum Lifshitz Model"" -- that illustrates the critical
drag mechanism as well as the other considerations of the paper.

of quantum black holes as well as dynamics in quantum many-body systems from
the viewpoint of quantum error-correcting codes. While finding an efficient
universal information recovery procedure seems challenging, some interesting
classes of dynamical systems may admit efficient recovery algorithms. Here we
present simple deterministic recovery algorithms for the Hayden-Preskill
problem when its unitary dynamics is given by a Clifford operator. The
algorithms utilize generalized Bell measurements and apply feedback operations
based on the measurement result. The recovery fidelity and the necessary
feedback operation can be found by analyzing the operator growth. These
algorithms can also serve as a decoding strategy for entanglement-assisted
quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs). We also present a version of recovery
algorithms with local Pauli basis measurements, which can be viewed as a
many-body generalization of quantum teleportation with fault-tolerance. A
certain relation between out-of-time order correlation functions and discrete
Wigner functions is also discussed, which may be of independent interest.

system with interacting constituents exhibiting a decoherence-free subspace. We
consider a two-qubit system coupled to an $N$-qubit environment via a dephasing
interaction. For excitation preserving interactions between the system qubits,
an analytical expression for the dynamics is obtained. It demonstrates that
part of the system Hilbert space redundantly proliferates its information to
the environment, while the remaining subspace is decoupled and preserves clear
non-classical signatures. For measurements performed on the system, we
establish that a non-zero quantum discord is shared between the composite
system and the environment, thus violating the conditions of strong Darwinism.
However, due to the asymmetry of quantum discord, the information shared with
the environment is completely classical for measurements performed on the
environment. Our results imply a dichotomy between objectivity and classicality

circumbinary planetary companions, other authors suggest that the Applegate
effect or other unknown stellar mechanisms could be responsible for them. In
this work, we present twenty-eight unpublished high-precision light curves of
one of the most controversial of these systems, the prototype HW Virginis. We
homogeneously analysed the new eclipse timings together with historical data
obtained between 1983 and 2012, demonstrating that the planetary models
previously claimed do not fit the new photometric data, besides being
dynamically unstable. In an effort to find a new model able to fit all the
available data, we developed a new approach based on a global-search genetic
algorithm and eventually found two new distinct families of solutions that fit
the observed timings very well, yet dynamically unstable at the 10^5-year time
scale. This serves as a cautionary tale on the existence of formal solutions
that apparently explain ETVs but are not physically meaningful, and on the need
of carefully testing their stability. On the other hand, our data confirm the
presence of an ETV on HW Vir that known stellar mechanisms are unable to
explain, pushing towards further observing and modelling efforts.

helpful, not detrimental, to QAOA. Using this matching to link QAOA with
quantum adiabatic algorithms (QAA), we show that the approximation ratio
converges to one at least as $1-C(p)\sim 1/p^{\mu}$. We show that transfer of
parameters between graphs, and interpolating angles for $p+1$ given $p$ are
both natural byproducts of CD-QAOA matching. Optimization of CD-QAOA angles is
equivalent to optimizing a continuous adiabatic schedule. Finally, we show
that, using a property of variational adiabatic gauge potentials, QAOA is at
least counterdiabatic, not just adiabatic, and has better performance than
finite time adiabatic evolution. We demonstrate the method on three examples: a
2 level system, an Ising chain, and the MaxCut problem.

Standard Model. We assert that a minimal $R$-parity violating supersymmetric
scenario with relatively light third-generation sfermions (dubbed as 'RPV3')
provides a natural, well-motivated framework for the simultaneous explanation
of all flavor anomalies, while being consistent with a multitude of low-energy
flavor constraints, as well as with limits from high-energy collider searches.
We further propose complementary tests and distinct signatures of this scenario
in the high-$p_T$ searches at current and future colliders. Specifically, we
find that an sbottom in the mass range of 2-12 TeV accounts for $R_{D^{(*)}}$
and $R_{K^{(*)}}$ flavor anomalies and it only plays a minor role in the
$(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly, whereas a sneutrino with mass between 0.7-1 TeV is the
dominant player for $(g-2)_\mu$. In this context, we propose specific collider
signatures of sbottom via its decays to $ \overline{ t}(t) \mu^+ \mu^-$, and of
sneutrino pairs with their decays leading to a highly distinctive and
spectacular four-muon final state, which can be used to completely probe the
RPV3 parameter space of interest.

Solving this problem requires learning of contextual semantic priors, a

goal-oriented navigation policy functions operating on spatial representations
that are limited to the agent's observable areas. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that actively learns to generate semantic maps outside the

that through this spatial prediction strategy, we are able to learn semantic
priors in scenes that can be leveraged in unknown environments. Additionally,
we show how different objectives can be defined by balancing exploration with

motor plans for those skills. However, one of the active research challenge
still remains to sustain manipulation capabilities in situation of a mechanical
failure. Ideally, like biological creatures, a robotic agent should be able to
reconfigure its control policy by adapting to dynamic adversaries. In this
paper, we propose a method that allows an agent to survive in a situation of
mechanical loss, and adaptively learn manipulation with compromised degrees of
freedom -- we call our method Survivable Robotic Learning (SRL). Our key idea
is to leverage Bayesian policy gradient by encoding knowledge bias in posterior
estimation, which in turn alleviates future policy search explorations, in
terms of sample efficiency and when compared to random exploration based policy
search methods. SRL represents policy priors as Gaussian process, which allows
tractable computation of approximate posterior (when true gradient is
intractable), by incorporating guided bias as proxy from prior replays. We
evaluate our proposed method against off-the-shelf model free learning

incremental failure emulation, and our experiments show that our method
improves largely in terms of sample requirement and quantitative success ratio

self-consistent at the 1% level. New Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) data
provide an additional consistency check, at a (lower) 5% level of accuracy, a

measurements of the cosmic microwave background. The TRGB results are also
consistent to within 2$\sigma$ with the SHoES and Spitzer plus HST Key Project
Cepheid calibrations. The TRGB results alone do not demand additional new
physics beyond the standard Lambda-CDM cosmological model. They have the
advantage of simplicity of the underlying physics (the core He flash) and small
systematic uncertainties (from extinction, metallicity and crowding). Finally,
the strengths and weaknesses of both the TRGB and Cepheids are reviewed, and
prospects for addressing the current discrepancy with future Gaia, HST and JWST

as binaural cues based on differences between the ears. So far auditory models
have often focused on either monaural or binaural experiments in isolation.
Although binaural models typically build upon stages of (existing) monaural
models, only a few attempts have been made to extend a monaural model by a
binaural stage using a unified decision stage for monaural and binaural cues.
In such approaches, a typical prototype of binaural processing has been the
classical equalization-cancelation mechanism, which either involves
signal-adaptive delays and provides a single channel output or can be
implemented with tapped delays providing a high-dimensional multichannel
output. This contribution extends the (monaural) generalized envelope power
spectrum model by a non-adaptive binaural stage with only a few, fixed output
channels. The binaural stage resembles features of physiologically motivated
hemispheric binaural processing, as simplified signal processing stages,
yielding a 5-channel monaural and binaural matrix feature ""decoder"" (BMFD). The
back end of the existing monaural model is applied to the 5-channel BMFD output
and calculates short-time envelope power and power features. The model is
evaluated and discussed for a baseline database of monaural and binaural

probabilistic modeling: probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) and tensor
networks (TNs), a powerful modeling framework for simulating complex quantum
systems. The graphical calculus of PGMs and TNs exhibits many similarities,
with discrete undirected graphical models (UGMs) being a special case of TNs.
However, more general probabilistic TN models such as Born machines (BMs)
employ complex-valued hidden states to produce novel forms of correlation among
the probabilities. While representing a new modeling resource for capturing
structure in discrete probability distributions, this behavior also renders the
direct application of standard PGM tools impossible. We aim to bridge this gap
by introducing a hybrid PGM-TN formalism that integrates quantum-like
correlations into PGM models in a principled manner, using the
physically-motivated concept of decoherence. We first prove that applying
decoherence to the entirety of a BM model converts it into a discrete UGM, and
conversely, that any subgraph of a discrete UGM can be represented as a
decohered BM. This method allows a broad family of probabilistic TN models to
be encoded as partially decohered BMs, a fact we leverage to combine the
representational strengths of both model families. We experimentally verify the
performance of such hybrid models in a sequential modeling task, and identify
promising uses of our method within the context of existing applications of
graphical models.

The Fermi-surface topology of an atomically thin ferromagnet is substantially
modified by the hybridization with a heavy-metal substrate, giving rise to
Fermi-surface discontinuities that are bridged by the Fermi arcs. Due to the
interplay between magnetism and topology, we can control both the shape and the

modes can be treated as linear perturbations to the background star. However,
observations by the Kepler mission show that the oscillation amplitudes
increase dramatically as stars ascend the red giant branch. The importance of
nonlinear effects should therefore be assessed. In previous work, we found that
mixed modes in red giants are unstable to nonlinear three-wave interactions
over a broad range of stellar mass and evolutionary state. Here we solve the
amplitude equations that describe the mode dynamics for large networks of
nonlinearly coupled modes. The networks consist of stochastically driven parent
modes coupled to resonant secondary modes (daughters, granddaughters, etc.). We
find that nonlinear interactions can lower the energy of gravity-dominated
mixed modes by $\gtrsim 80\%$ compared to linear theory. However, they have
only a mild influence on the energy of pressure-dominated mixed modes.
Expressed in terms of the dipole mode visibility $V^2$, i.e., the summed
amplitudes of dipole modes relative to radial modes, we find that $V^2$ can be
suppressed by $50-80\%$ relative to the linear value for highly-evolved red
giants whose frequency of maximum power $\nu_{\rm max} \lesssim
100\,\mu\textrm{Hz}$. However, for less evolved red giants with $150\lesssim
\nu_{\rm max} \lesssim 200\,\mu\textrm{Hz}$, $V^2$ is suppressed by only
$10-20\%$. We conclude that resonant mode coupling can have a potentially
detectable effect on oscillations at $\nu_{\rm max} \lesssim
100\,\mu\textrm{Hz}$ but it cannot account for the population of red giants

$(d\geqslant 2)$ over the shift are well defined for all points in a total
probability set, ie, a full measure subset for all invariant probabilities.
Given a locally constant $\mathrm{SL}(d,\mathbb R)$-valued cocycle we are
interested both in the set of points on the shift space for which some Lyapunov
exponent is not well defined, and in the set of directions on the projective
space $\mathbf P \mathbb R^d$ along which there exists no well defined
exponential growth rate of vectors for a certain product of matrices. We prove
that if the semigroup generated by finitely many matrices in
$\mathrm{SL}(d,\mathbb R)$ is not compact and is strongly projectively
accessible then there exists a dense set of directions in $\mathbf P \mathbb

not well defined. As a consequence, we deduce that the presence of Lyapunov
non-typical behavior is prevalent among $SL(3,\mathbb R)$-valued hyperbolic

of the set of non-typical points for Ces\`aro averages of continuous

equivariant systems, a phase space stitching result is developed to identify
the global Koopman operator using the symmetry properties between the invariant

correlation tensors. We prove that tensor eigenvectors are attractors and
determine their basins of attraction. We calculate the volume of those basins,
showing that the dominant eigenvector has the largest basin of attraction. We
then study arbitrary learning rules and find that any learning rule that admits

structure of these distant worlds. A common assumption made when using this
technique, however, is that the variations are the same in the entire
terminator region. In reality, the morning and evening terminators might have
distinct temperature, pressure and thus compositional profiles due to the
inherent 3-D nature of the planet which would, in turn, give rise to different
spectra on each side of it. Constraining those might be fundamental for our
understanding of not only the weather patterns in these distant worlds, but
also of planetary formation signatures which might only be possible to extract
once these features are well understood. Motivated by this physical picture, in
this work we perform a detailed study on the observational prospects of
detecting this effect. We present an open-source semi-analytical framework with
which this information can be extracted directly from transit lightcurves, and
perform a detailed study on the prospects of detecting the effect with current
missions such as TESS and upcoming ones such as JWST. Our results show that
these missions show great promise for the detection of this effect.
Transmission spectroscopy studies with JWST, in particular, could provide
spectra of each of the limbs allowing us to convey 3-D information previously
accessible only via phase-curves.

to improve the performance efficiency of inference. DNN partitions are
determined based on operational conditions such as network speed. When
operational conditions change DNNs will need to be repartitioned to maintain
the overall performance. However, repartitioning using existing approaches,
such as Pause and Resume, will incur a service downtime on the edge. This paper
presents the NEUKONFIG framework that identifies the service downtime incurred
when repartitioning DNNs and proposes approaches for reducing edge service
downtime. The proposed approaches are based on 'Dynamic Switching' in which,
when the network speed changes and given an existing edge-cloud pipeline, a new
edge-cloud pipeline is initialised with new DNN partitions. Incoming inference
requests are switched to the new pipeline for processing data. Two dynamic
switching scenarios are considered: when a second edge-cloud pipeline is always
running and when a second pipeline is only initialised when the network speed
changes. Experimental studies are carried out on a lab-based testbed to
demonstrate that Dynamic Switching reduces the downtime by at least an order of
magnitude when compared to a baseline using Pause and Resume that has a
downtime of 6 seconds. A trade-off in the edge service downtime and memory
required is noted. The Dynamic Switching approach that requires the same amount
of memory as the baseline reduces the edge service downtime to 0.6 seconds and
to less than 1 millisecond in the best case when twice the amount of memory as
the baseline is available.

The
combination of deep neural networks with reinforcement learning has gained
increased traction in recent years and is slowly shifting the focus from
single-agent to multiagent environments. Dealing with multiple agents is
inherently more complex as (a) the future rewards depend on multiple players'
joint actions and (b) the computational complexity increases. We present the
most common multiagent problem representations and their main challenges, and
identify five research areas that address one or more of these challenges:
centralised training and decentralised execution, opponent modelling,
communication, efficient coordination, and reward shaping. We find that many
computational studies rely on unrealistic assumptions or are not generalisable
to other settings; they struggle to overcome the curse of dimensionality or
nonstationarity. Approaches from psychology and sociology capture promising
relevant behaviours, such as communication and coordination, to help agents
achieve better performance in multiagent settings. We suggest that, for
multiagent reinforcement learning to be successful, future research should
address these challenges with an interdisciplinary approach to open up new
possibilities in multiagent reinforcement learning.

as a Cauchy problem, in which configurations and conjugate momenta are

boundary conditions, and indeed in action-principle formulations we often
specify configurations at two times and consider trajectories joining them.
Here, we consider a classical system of particles interacting with short range
two body interactions, with boundary conditions on the particles' positions for
an initial and a final time. For a large number of particles that are randomly
arranged into a dilute gas, we find that a typical system trajectory will
spontaneously collapse into a small region of space, close to the maximum
density that is obtainable, before expanding out again. If generalizable, this
has important implications for the cosmological arrow of time, potentially
allowing a scenario in which both boundary conditions are generic and also a
low-entropy state ""initial"" state of the universe naturally occurs.

science and chemistry. However, a thorough understanding of the underlying
interactions is still missing. The theoretical description relies on either
simple approximations or on purely numerical approaches. We close this gap and
present a general theory of chiral light-matter interactions in arbitrary
resonators. Our theory describes the chiral interaction as a perturbation of
the resonator modes, also known as resonant states or quasi-normal modes. We
observe two dominant contributions: A chirality-induced resonance shift and
changes in the modes excitation and emission efficiencies. Our theory brings
new and deep insights for tailoring and enhancing chiral light-matter
interactions. Furthermore, it allows to predict spectra much more efficiently
in comparison to conventional approaches. This is particularly true as chiral
interactions are inherently weak and therefore perturbation theory fits
extremely well for this problem.

chiral symmetry can be restored bringing the chiral partners to be nearly

follows a smooth transition, and the chiral companions reach this degeneration
above the transition temperature. In this work I review how different

The model is studied using the continuum-limit bosonization approach and the

the ground-state phase diagram of the model includes besides the ferromagnetic

alternating dimerization and the spin chirality patterns, and the composite
(C2) phase characterized in addition to the coexisting spin dimerization and
alternating chirality patterns, by the presence of LRO antiferromagnetic order.
In the case of two-letter gapped phases, in the case of a uniform magnetic
field, the commensurate-incommensurate type quantum phase transitions (QPT)
from a gapful phase into the gapless phase have been identified and described
using the bosonization treatment and finite chain exact diagonalizations

discriminate between graphs constructed from shoot apical meristem images of

demonstrate this by showing improved performance of a simple

demonstrate a further application of this method to biological image analysis:

context of the rise of populism and its effects on the political system. We
focus on Germany and the appearance of the new right wing party ""Alternative
for Germany"" (AfD). Many scholars of politics discuss the rise of the new
populism in Western Europe and the US with respect to a new political cleavage
related to globalization, which is assumed to mainly affect the cultural
dimension of the political space. As such, it might replace the older economic
cleavage based on class divisions in defining the dominant dimension of
political conflict. An explanation along these lines suggests a reconfiguration
of the political space in the sense that (1) the main cleavage within the
political space changes its direction from the economic axis towards the
cultural axis, but (2) also the semantics of the cultural axis itself is
changing towards globalization related topics. Using the electoral manifestos
from the Manifesto project database, we empirically address this
reconfiguration of the political space by comparing political spaces for
Germany built using topic modeling with the spaces based on the content
analysis of the Manifesto project and the corresponding categories of political
goals. We find that both spaces have a similar structure and that the AfD
appears on a new dimension. In order to characterize this new dimension we
employ a novel technique, inter-issue consistency networks (IICN) that allow to
analyze the evolution of the correlations between the political positions on
different issues over several elections. We find that the new dimension
introduced by the AfD can be related to the split off of a new ""cultural right""
issue bundle from the previously existing center-right bundle.

Clustering methods are a promising approach to tackle this challenge and

The present study aimed to improve energy consumption in heterogeneous IoT
devices using an energy-aware clustering method. In a heterogeneous IoT
network, nodes (i.e., battery-powered IoT devices) can have a variety of energy
profiles and communication capabilities. Most of the existing clustering
algorithms have neglected the heterogeneity of energy capacity among nodes and
assumed that they are of the same energy level. In this work, we present
HetEng, a Cluster Head (CH) selection process that extended an existing
clustering algorithm, named Smart-BEEM. To this end, we proposed a statistical
approach that distributes energy consumption among highly energetic nodes in
the network topology by constantly changing the CH role between the nodes based
on their real energy levels (in joules). Experimental results showed that
HetEng resulted in a 6.6% increase of alive nodes and 3% improvement in
residual energy among the nodes in comparison with SmartBEEM. Moreover, our
method reduced the total number of iterations by 1% on average.

data drawn from distributions different from the training data distribution and
suffer drop in performance. For safe deployment, it is essential to estimate
the accuracy of the pre-trained model on the test data. However, the labels for
the test inputs are usually not immediately available in practice, and
obtaining them can be expensive. This observation leads to two challenging
tasks: (1) unsupervised accuracy estimation, which aims to estimate the
accuracy of a pre-trained classifier on a set of unlabeled test inputs; (2)
error detection, which aims to identify mis-classified test inputs. In this
paper, we propose a principled and practically effective framework that
simultaneously addresses the two tasks. The proposed framework iteratively
learns an ensemble of models to identify mis-classified data points and
performs self-training to improve the ensemble with the identified points.
Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our framework enjoys provable guarantees
for both accuracy estimation and error detection under mild conditions readily
satisfied by practical deep learning models. Along with the framework, we
proposed and experimented with two instantiations and achieved state-of-the-art

estimation error for unsupervised accuracy estimation by at least 70% and
improves the F1 score for error detection by at least 4.7% compared to existing

the agents move along the nodes of a graph, and the high-level task
specifications for the swarm are expressed in a recently-proposed language
called graph temporal logic (GTL). By constraining the distribution of the
swarm over the nodes of the graph, GTL can specify a wide range of properties,
including safety, progress, and response. $\texttt{GTLProCo}$, agnostic to the
number of agents comprising the swarm, controls the density distribution of the
swarm in a decentralized and probabilistic manner. To this end, it synthesizes
a time-varying Markov chain modeling the time evolution of the density
distribution under the GTL constraints. We first identify a subset of GTL,
namely reach-avoid specifications, for which we can reduce the synthesis of
such a Markov chain to either linear or semi-definite programs. Then, in the
general case, we formulate the synthesis of the Markov chain as a mixed-integer

monitoring of such contaminants often involves a substantial proportion of
left-censored observations falling below a minimum detection limit (MDL). This

and econometric literature in order to relax the linear or quadratic covariate
effect in regression analyses. The typical shape-restricted covariate effect
includes monotonic increasing, decreasing, convexity or concavity. In this
paper, we introduce the shape-restricted inference to the celebrated Cox
regression model (SR-Cox), in which the covariate response is modeled as
shape-restricted additive functions. The SR-Cox regression approximates the
shape-restricted functions using a spline basis expansion with data driven
choice of knots. The underlying minimization of negative log-likelihood
function is formulated as a convex optimization problem, which is solved with
an active-set optimization algorithm. The highlight of this algorithm is that
it eliminates the superfluous knots automatically. When covariate effects
include combinations of convex or concave terms with unknown forms and linear
terms, the most interesting finding is that SR-Cox produces accurate linear
covariate effect estimates which are comparable to the maximum partial
likelihood estimates if indeed the forms are known. We conclude that concave or
convex SR-Cox models could significantly improve nonlinear covariate response
recovery and model goodness of fit.

introduces challenges that are only partially addressed by existing analytic
approaches. First, outcomes are often missing for some individuals within
clusters. Failing to appropriately adjust for differential outcome measurement
can result in biased estimates and inference. Second, CRTs often randomize
limited numbers of clusters, resulting in chance imbalances on baseline outcome
predictors between arms. Failing to adaptively adjust for these imbalances and
other predictive covariates can result in efficiency losses. To address these
methodological gaps, we propose and evaluate a novel two-stage targeted minimum
loss-based estimator (TMLE) to adjust for baseline covariates in a manner that
optimizes precision, after controlling for baseline and post-baseline causes of
missing outcomes. Finite sample simulations illustrate that our approach can
nearly eliminate bias due to differential outcome measurement, while existing

activation of Kerr black holes (BHs) by advection of small scale magnetic
fields. Such configurations may potentially give rise to the formation of
quasi-striped Blandford-Znajek jets. It can also lead to enhanced dissipation
and generation of plasmoids in current sheets formed in the vicinity of the BH
horizon, which may constitute a mechanism to power the hard X-ray emission seen
in many accreting BH systems (a la lamppost models). Our analysis suggests that
formation of quasi-striped jets with significant power may be possible provided
loops with alternating polarity having sizes larger than $\sim 10 r_g$ or so
can be maintained (either form sporadically or advected from outside) at a
radius $\lesssim 10^2 r_g$. This conclusion is consistent with recent results
of general relativistic force-free simulations. We also find that the accretion
dynamics exhibits cyclic behaviour in MAD states, alternating between high
accretion phases and quenched accretion phases during which the magnetosphere
becomes force-free out to radii $\gtrsim 10r_g$. We suggest that such a
behaviour should lead to notable variations of the observed luminosity and
image of the inner disc (BH shadow image). Finally, we find that the transition
between accreted loops on the BH gives rise to the formation of current sheets
and energetic plasmoids on the jet boundary during intermittent periods when
the jet becomes inactive, in addition to an equatorial current sheet that forms
during peaks in the jet activity.

understanding of biological structures in fluorescence microscopy images.
Existing automated nuclei localization methods face three main challenges: (1)
Most of object detection methods work only on 2D images and are difficult to
extend to 3D volumes; (2) Segmentation-based models can be used on 3D volumes
but it is computational expensive for large microscopy volumes and they have
difficulty distinguishing different instances of objects; (3) Hand annotated
ground truth is limited for 3D microscopy volumes. To address these issues, we
present a scalable approach for nuclei centroid detection of 3D microscopy
volumes. We describe the RCNN-SliceNet to detect 2D nuclei centroids for each
slice of the volume from different directions and 3D agglomerative hierarchical
clustering (AHC) is used to estimate the 3D centroids of nuclei in a volume.
The model was trained with the synthetic microscopy data generated using
Spatially Constrained Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks (SpCycleGAN) and
tested on different types of real 3D microscopy data. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed method can accurately count and detect
the nuclei centroids in a 3D microscopy volume.

High-Resolution (HR) Remote Sensing Images (RSIs). However, image cropping
operations, commonly used for training neural networks, limit the perception of
long-range contexts in large RSIs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Wide-Context Network (WiCoNet) for the semantic segmentation of HR RSIs. Apart
from extracting local features with a conventional CNN, the WiCoNet has an
extra context branch to aggregate information from a larger image area.
Moreover, we introduce a Context Transformer to embed contextual information
from the context branch and selectively project it onto the local features. The
Context Transformer extends the Vision Transformer, an emerging kind of neural
network, to model the dual-branch semantic correlations. It overcomes the
locality limitation of CNNs and enables the WiCoNet to see the bigger picture
before segmenting the land-cover/land-use (LCLU) classes. Ablation studies and
comparative experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, we present a new Beijing
Land-Use (BLU) dataset. This is a large-scale HR satellite dataset with
high-quality and fine-grained reference labels, which can facilitate future
studies in this field.

nodes and a reliable/uncorrupted graph connectivity structure in order to
obtain good performance on the semi-supervised node classification task. The
performance of GNNs can degrade significantly as the number of labeled nodes
decreases or the graph connectivity structure is corrupted by adversarial
attacks or due to noises in data measurement /collection. Therefore, it is
important to develop GNN models that are able to achieve good performance when
there is limited supervision knowledge -- a few labeled nodes and noisy graph
structures. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual GNN learning framework to
address this challenge task. The proposed framework has two GNN based node
prediction modules. The primary module uses the input graph structure to induce
regular node embeddings and predictions with a regular GNN baseline, while the
auxiliary module constructs a new graph structure through fine-grained spectral
clusterings and learns new node embeddings and predictions. By integrating the
two modules in a dual GNN learning framework, we perform joint learning in an
end-to-end fashion. This general framework can be applied on many GNN baseline
models. The experimental results validate that the proposed dual GNN framework
can greatly outperform the GNN baseline methods when the labeled nodes are
scarce and the graph connectivity structure is noisy.

that show only outbursts. However, this object has entered a quite anomalous
event in 2021, which at first appeared to be standstill, i.e., an almost
constant luminosity state, observed in Z Cam-type dwarf novae. This unexpected
event gives us a great opportunity to reconsider the nature of standstill in
cataclysmic variables. We have observed this anomalous event and its
forerunner, a gradual and simultaneous increase in the optical and X-ray flux
during quiescence, through many optical telescopes and the X-ray telescopes
NICER and NuSTAR. We have not found any amplification of the orbital hump
during quiescence before the anomalous event, which suggests that the mass
transfer rate did not significantly fluctuate on average. The estimated X-ray
flux was not enough to explain the increment of the optical flux during
quiescence via X-ray irradiation of the disk and the secondary star. It would
be natural to consider that viscosity in the quiescent disk was enhanced before
the anomalous event, which increased mass accretion rates in the disk and
raised not only the optical flux but also the X-ray flux. We suggest that
enhanced viscosity also triggered the standstill-like phenomenon in SS Cyg,
which is considered to be a series of small outbursts. The inner part of the
disk would always stay in the outburst state and only its outer part would be
unstable against the thermal-viscous instability during this phenomenon, which
is consistent with the observed optical color variations. This scenario is in
line with our X-ray spectral analyses which imply that the X-ray emitting inner
accretion flow became hotter than usual and vertically expanded and that it
became denser and was cooled down after the onset of the standstill-like state.

introduce discrete graph curvature (the Ricci curvature) to quantify the
strength of structural connection of pairwise nodes. And we propose Curvature
Graph Neural Network (CGNN), which effectively improves the adaptive locality
ability of GNNs by leveraging the structural property of graph curvature. To
improve the adaptability of curvature to various datasets, we explicitly
transform curvature into the weights of neighboring nodes by the necessary
Negative Curvature Processing Module and Curvature Normalization Module. Then,
we conduct numerous experiments on various synthetic datasets and real-world

effectively exploits the topology structure information, and the performance is
improved significantly. CGNN outperforms the baselines on 5 dense node

During acquisition, multiple high-speed images are encoded and collapsed to a

fault-tolerant quantum computing, and this requires many ancillary qubits,

No-signaling principle guarantees that neither parameters chosen by the client

NOMA-aided mobile edge computing (MEC) can provide scalable and low-latency
computing services for the Internet of Things. However, given the prevalent
stochasticity of wireless networks and sophisticated signal processing of NOMA,
it is critical but challenging to design an efficient task offloading algorithm
for NOMA-aided MEC, especially under a large number of devices. This paper
presents an online algorithm that jointly optimizes offloading decisions and
resource allocation to maximize the long-term system utility (i.e., a measure
of throughput and fairness). Since the optimization variables are temporary
coupled, we first apply Lyapunov technique to decouple the long-term stochastic
optimization into a series of per-slot deterministic subproblems, which does
not require any prior knowledge of network dynamics. Second, we propose to
transform the non-convex per-slot subproblem of optimizing NOMA power
allocation equivalently to a convex form by introducing a set of auxiliary
variables, whereby the time-complexity is reduced from the exponential
complexity to $\mathcal{O} (M^{3/2})$. The proposed algorithm is proved to be
asymptotically optimal, even under partial knowledge of the device states at
the base station. Simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed
algorithm in terms of system utility, stability improvement, and the overhead
reduction.

robustness of trained models, where data being less/more vulnerable to the
given attack are assigned smaller/larger weights during training. However, when
tested on attacks different from the given attack simulated in training, the
robustness may drop significantly (e.g., even worse than no reweighting). In
this paper, we study this problem and propose our solution--locally reweighted
adversarial training (LRAT). The rationale behind IRAT is that we do not need
to pay much attention to an instance that is already safe under the attack. We
argue that the safeness should be attack-dependent, so that for the same
instance, its weight can change given different attacks based on the same
model. Thus, if the attack simulated in training is mis-specified, the weights
of IRAT are misleading. To this end, LRAT pairs each instance with its
adversarial variants and performs local reweighting inside each pair, while
performing no global reweighting--the rationale is to fit the instance itself
if it is immune to the attack, but not to skip the pair, in order to passively
defend different attacks in future. Experiments show that LRAT works better
than both IRAT (i.e., global reweighting) and the standard AT (i.e., no
reweighting) when trained with an attack and tested on different attacks.

data, for which there are two lines of methods have been proposed. One is based
on noise injection, and the other is to adopt the generative model Variational
Auto-encoder (VAE). However, the existing works still face two challenges.
First, the noise injection based methods often draw the noise from a fixed
noise distribution given in advance, while in real world, the noise
distributions of different users and items may differ from each other due to
personal behaviors and item usage patterns. Second, the VAE based models are
not expressive enough to capture the true preference since VAE often yields an
embedding space of a single modal, while in real world, user-item interactions
usually exhibit multi-modality on user preference distribution. In this paper,
we propose a novel model called Dual Adversarial Variational Embedding (DAVE)
for robust recommendation, which can provide personalized noise reduction for
different users and items, and capture the multi-modality of the embedding
space, by combining the advantages of VAE and adversarial training between the
introduced auxiliary discriminators and the variational inference networks. The
extensive experiments conducted on real datasets verify the effectiveness of
DAVE on robust recommendation.

emission has raised the question of the role of shocks in nova eruptions. Here
we use radio observations of nova V809 Cep (Nova Cep 2013) with the Jansky Very
Large Array to show that it produced non-thermal emission indicative of
particle acceleration in strong shocks for more than a month starting about six
weeks into the eruption, quasi-simultaneous with the production of dust.
Broadly speaking, the radio emission at late times -- more than a six months or
so into the eruption -- is consistent with thermal emission from $10^{-4}
M_\odot$ of freely expanding, $10^4$~K ejecta. At 4.6 and 7.4 GHz, however, the
radio light-curves display an initial early-time peak 76 days after the
discovery of the eruption in the optical ($t_0$). The brightness temperature at
4.6 GHz on day 76 was greater than $10^5 K$, an order of magnitude above what
is expected for thermal emission. We argue that the brightness temperature is
the result of synchrotron emission due to internal shocks within the ejecta.
The evolution of the radio spectrum was consistent with synchrotron emission
that peaked at high frequencies before low frequencies, suggesting that the
synchrotron from the shock was initially subject to free-free absorption by
optically thick ionized material in front of the shock. Dust formation began
around day 37, and we suggest that internal shocks in the ejecta were
established prior to dust formation and caused the nucleation of dust.

two-day workshop on Virtual Meetings held May 5-6, 2021 which brought together
experts from both inside and outside of high-energy physics to share their

to develop possible strategies for future meetings as we begin to emerge from

complementary tests of macrorealism i.e., temporal separability, channel
unsteerability, temporal unsteerability, and the temporal Bell inequality. To
demonstrate this we first define a steerability-breaking channel, which is
conceptually similar to entanglement and nonlocality-breaking channels and
prove that it is identical to an incompatibility-breaking channel. A hierarchy
of quantum non-breaking channels is derived, akin to the existing hierarchy
relations for temporal and spatial quantum correlations. We then introduce the
concept of channels that break temporal correlations, explain how they are
related to the standard breaking channels, and prove the following results: (1)
A robustness-based measure for non-entanglement-breaking channels can be probed
by temporal nonseparability. (2) A non-steerability-breaking channel can be
quantified by channel steering. (3) Temporal steerability and non-macrorealism
can be used for, respectively, distinguishing unital steerability-breaking
channels and nonlocality-breaking channels for a maximally entangled state.
Finally, a two-dimensional depolarizing channel is experimentally implemented
as a proof-of-principle example to demonstrate the hierarchy relation of
non-breaking channels using temporal quantum correlations

their ability to achieve consistent performance on different training samples

estimation error will get close to order O_p(1/\sqrt{n}). This is the first
study to provide a generalization bound for OSL, which we do by theoretically
investigating the risk of the target classifier on unknown classes. According

application of the method is demonstrated by analyzing the nonlinear Hall

slope. Due to the lack of insight in industrial application, existing methods
on open datasets neglect the camera pose information, which inevitably results
in the detector being susceptible to camera extrinsic parameters. The
perturbation of objects is very popular in most autonomous driving cases for

the proposed framework predicts camera extrinsic parameters by detecting
vanishing point and horizon change. A converter is designed to rectify
perturbative features in the latent space. By doing so, our 3D detector works
independent of the extrinsic parameter variations and produces accurate results
in realistic cases, e.g., potholed and uneven roads, where almost all existing

powerful feature learning ability of convolution layers. Specifically, the
standard convolution traverses the input images/features using a sliding window
scheme to extract features. However, not all the windows contribute equally to
the prediction results of CNNs. In practice, the convolutional operation on
some of the windows (e.g., smooth windows that contain very similar pixels) can
be very redundant and may introduce noises into the computation. Such
redundancy may not only deteriorate the performance but also incur the
unnecessary computational cost. Thus, it is important to reduce the
computational redundancy of convolution to improve the performance. To this
end, we propose a Content-aware Convolution (CAC) that automatically detects
the smooth windows and applies a 1x1 convolutional kernel to replace the
original large kernel. In this sense, we are able to effectively avoid the
redundant computation on similar pixels. By replacing the standard convolution
in CNNs with our CAC, the resultant models yield significantly better

suddenly increases. However, such outbursts are difficult to detect for deeply
embedded protostars due to their thick envelope and the rarity of outbursts.
The near-IR spectroscopy is a useful tool to identify ongoing outburst
candidates by the characteristic absorption features that indicate a disk
origin. However, without high-resolution spectroscopy, the spectra of outburst
candidates can be confused with the late-type stars since they have similar
spectral features. For the protostar IRAS 16316-1540, the near-IR spectrum has
line equivalent widths that are consistent with M-dwarf photospheres. However,
our high-resolution IGRINS spectra reveal that the absorption lines have boxy
and/or double-peaked profiles, as expected from a disk and not the star. The
continuum emission source is likely the hot, optically thick disk, heated by
viscous accretion. The projected disk rotation velocity of 41$\pm$5 km s$^{-1}$
corresponds to $\sim 0.1$ AU. Based on the result, we suggest IRAS 16316-1540

and protein interactions, and such data can evolve over time (e.g., new
friendships) and be noisy (e.g., unmeasured interactions). Link prediction aims
to predict future edges or infer missing edges in the graph, and has diverse
applications in recommender systems, experimental design, and complex systems.
Even though link prediction algorithms strongly depend on the set of edges in
the graph, existing approaches typically do not modify the graph topology to
improve performance. Here, we demonstrate how simply adding a set of edges,
which we call a \emph{proposal set}, to the graph as a pre-processing step can
improve the performance of several link prediction algorithms. The underlying
idea is that if the edges in the proposal set generally align with the
structure of the graph, link prediction algorithms are further guided towards
predicting the right edges; in other words, adding a proposal set of edges is a
signal-boosting pre-processing step. We show how to use existing link
prediction algorithms to generate effective proposal sets and evaluate this
approach on various synthetic and empirical datasets. We find that proposal
sets meaningfully improve the accuracy of link prediction algorithms based on
both neighborhood heuristics and graph neural networks. Code is available at

our method provably controls the FDR in finite samples even if the classifier

underpowered, and is especially well-suited for testing composite null

Sequence-to-Graph (Seq2Graph) augmentation for each POI sequence, allowing

SGRec makes full use of the collaborative signals for learning expressive POI
representations, and also comprehensively uncovers multi-level sequential
patterns for user preference modelling. Extensive experiments on two real-world

estimating the impact of the ionised interstellar medium on the impulsive

electron density models are YMW16 (Yao et al., 2017) and NE2001 (Cordes &

unified application programming interface (API) for these models and the YT20

all-sky maps of Galactic dispersion measure (DM) for YMW16 and NE2001, and
compare the large-scale differences between the two. In general, YMW16 predicts
higher DM values toward the Galactic anticentre. YMW16 predicts higher DMs at
low Galactic latitudes, but NE2001 predicts higher DMs in most other
directions. We identify lines of sight for which the models are most
discrepant, using pulsars with independent distance measurements. YMW16
performs better on average than NE2001, but both models show significant
outliers. We suggest that future campaigns to determine pulsar distances should
focus on targets where the models show large discrepancies, so future models
can use those measurements to better estimate distances along those line of

component in future GEDMs, to avoid overestimating the Galactic DM contribution

recovery} (\ptr) that effectively deconvolves known physics and detector
effects from nuclear recoil tracks in gas time projection chambers (TPCs) with
high-resolution readout. This gives access to the primary track charge, length,
and vector direction (helping to resolve the ""head-tail"" ambiguity).
Additionally, \ptr provides a measurement of the transverse and longitudinal
diffusion widths, which can be used to determine the absolute position of
tracks in the drift direction for detector fiducialization. Using simulated
helium recoils in an atmospheric pressure TPC with a 70:30 mixture of He:CO$_2$
we compare the performance of \ptr to traditional methods for all key track
variables. We find that the algorithm reduces reconstruction errors, including
those caused by charge integration, for tracks with mean length-to-width ratios
1.4 and above, corresponding to recoil energies of $20$ keV and above in the
studied TPCs. We show that \ptr improves on existing methods for head-tail
disambiguation, particularly for highly inclined tracks, and improves the
determination of the absolute position of recoils on the drift axis via
transverse diffusion. We find that \ptr can partially recover charge structure
integrated out by the detector in the $z$ direction, but that its determination
of energy and length have worse resolution compared to existing methods. We use
experimental data to qualitatively verify these findings and discuss
implications for future directional detectors at the low-energy frontier.

ropes, which are dubbed as magnetic clouds in interplanetary space. The
composition (including the ionic charge states and elemental abundances) is
determined prior to and/or during CME eruptions in the solar atmosphere, and
does not alter during magnetic cloud propagation to 1 AU and beyond. It has
been known that the composition is not uniform within a cross section
perpendicular to magnetic cloud axis, and the distribution of ionic charge
states within a cross section provides us an important clue to investigate the
formation and eruption processes of flux ropes due to the freeze-in effect. The
flux rope is a three dimensional magnetic structure intrinsically, and it
remains unclear whether the composition is uniform along the flux rope axis as
most magnetic clouds are only detected by one spacecraft. In this paper we
report a magnetic cloud that was observed by ACE near 1 AU on 1998 March 4--6
and Ulysses near 5.4 AU on March 24--28 sequentially. At these times, both
spacecraft were located around the ecliptic plane, and the latitudinal and
longitudinal separations between them were $\sim$2.2$^{\circ}$ and
$\sim$5.5$^{\circ}$, respectively. It provides us an excellent opportunity to
explore the axial inhomogeneity of flux rope composition, as both spacecraft
almost intersected the cloud center at different sites along its axis. Our
study shows that the average values of ionic charge states exhibit significant
difference along the axis for carbon, and the differences are relatively slight
but still obvious for charge states of oxygen and iron, as well as the
elemental abundances of iron and helium. Besides the means, the composition

Moreover, we provide an end-to-end model interpretation pipeline that
interprets the operations of all the components of the proposed framework. Our
analysis of different feature fusion strategies shows that the proposed feature
concatenation method leads to better suppression of non-informative features,

core-collapse of massive, rapidly spinning stars and the formation of black

currently supported by asteroseismic and gravitational-wave constraints, leads
to predominantly slowly-spinning stellar cores. Here, we report on binary
stellar evolution and population synthesis calculations, showing that tidal
interactions in close binaries not only can explain the observed sub-population
of spinning, merging binary black holes but also lead to long gamma-ray bursts
at the time of black-hole formation. Given our model calibration against the
distribution of isotropic-equivalent energies of luminous long gamma-ray
bursts, we find that ~10% of the GWTC-2 reported binary black holes had a
luminous long gamma-ray burst associated with their formation, with GW190517
and GW190719 having a probability of ~85% and ~60%, respectively, being among
them. Moreover, given an assumption about their average beaming fraction, our
model predicts the rate density of long gamma-ray bursts, as a function of
redshift, originating from this channel. For a constant beaming fraction
$f_\mathrm{B}\sim 0.05$ our model predicts a rate density comparable to the
observed one, throughout the redshift range, while, at redshift $z \in
[0,2.5]$, a tentative comparison with the metallicity distribution of observed
LGRB host galaxies implies that between 20% to 85% of the observed long
gamma-ray bursts may originate from progenitors of merging binary black holes.
The proposed link between a potentially significant fraction of observed,

we investigate some of the underlying assumptions of rationality, such as
mutual consistency and best response, and consider ways to relax these
assumptions using concepts from level-$k$ reasoning and quantal response
equilibrium (QRE) respectively. Specifically, we propose an
information-theoretic two-parameter model called the Quantal Hierarchy model,
which can relax both mutual consistency and best response while still
approximating level-$k$, QRE, or typical Nash equilibrium behaviour in the
limiting cases. The model is based on a recursive form of the variational free
energy principle, representing higher-order reasoning as (pseudo) sequential
decision-making in extensive-form game tree. This representation enables us to
treat simultaneous games in a similar manner to sequential games, where
reasoning resources deplete throughout the game-tree. Bounds in player
processing abilities are captured as information costs, where future branches
of reasoning are discounted, implying a hierarchy of players where lower-level
players have fewer processing resources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
the Quantal Hierarchy model in several canonical economic games, {both
simultaneous and sequential}, using out-of-sample modelling.

be capable to automatically select appropriate emotions for responses like

difference in emotion expression is overlooked. This may lead to inconsistent
emotional expressions and disinterest users. To tackle this issue, we propose
to equip the dialog system with personality and enable it to automatically
select emotions in responses by simulating the emotion transition of humans in
conversation. In detail, the emotion of the dialog system is transitioned from
its preceding emotion in context. The transition is triggered by the preceding
dialog context and affected by the specified personality trait. To achieve
this, we first model the emotion transition in the dialog system as the
variation between the preceding emotion and the response emotion in the
Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) emotion space. Then, we design neural networks
to encode the preceding dialog context and the specified personality traits to
compose the variation. Finally, the emotion for response is selected from the
sum of the preceding emotion and the variation. We construct a dialog dataset
with emotion and personality labels and conduct emotion prediction tasks for

data involving missingness and unbalanced study designs. We consider a Bayesian
clustering method that combines linear mixed models and predictive projections.
For each observation, we consider a predictive replicate in which only a subset
of the random effects is shared between the observation and its replicate, with
the remainder being integrated out using the conditional prior. Predictive
projections are then defined in which the number of distinct values taken by
the shared random effects is finite, in order to obtain different clusters.
Integrating out some of the random effects acts as a noise filter, allowing the
clustering to be focused on only certain chosen features of the data. The
method is inspired by methods for Bayesian model checking, in which simulated
data replicates from a fitted model are used for model criticism by examining
their similarity to the observed data in relevant ways. Here the predictive
replicates are used to define similarity between observations in relevant ways
for clustering. To illustrate the way our method reveals aspects of the data at
different scales, we consider fitting temporal trends in longitudinal data
using Fourier cosine bases with a random effect for each basis function, and
different clusterings defined by shared random effects for replicates of low or
high frequency terms. The method is demonstrated in a series of real examples.

roles in constraining their magnitudes and $x$ dependencies and in studying
higher-twist effects. The Wandzura-Wilczek (WW) relation and the
Burkhardt-Cottingham (BC) sum rule are such examples for the polarized
structure functions $g_1$ and $g_2$. Recently, new twist-3 and twist-4 parton
distribution functions were proposed for spin-1 hadrons, so that it became
possible to investigate spin-1 structure functions including higher-twist ones.
We show in this work that an analogous twist-2 relation and a sum rule exist
for the tensor-polarized parton distribution functions $f_{1LL}$ and $f_{LT}$,
where $f_{1LL}$ is a twist-2 function and $f_{LT}$ is a twist-3 one. Namely,
the twist-2 part of $f_{LT}$ is expressed by an integral of $f_{1LL}$ (or
$b_1$) and the integral of the function $f_{2LT} = (2/3) f_{LT} -f_{1LL}$ over
$x$ vanishes. If the parton-model sum rule for $f_{1LL}$ ($b_1$) is applied by
assuming vanishing tensor-polarized antiquark distributions, another sum rule
also exists for $f_{LT}$ itself. These relations should be valuable for
studying tensor-polarized distribution functions of spin-1 hadrons and for
separating twist-2 components from higher-twist terms, as the WW relation and
BC sum rule have been used for investigating $x$ dependence and higher-twist
effects in $g_2$. In deriving these relations, we indicate that four twist-3
multiparton distribution functions $F_{LT}$, $G_{LT}$, $H_{LL}^\perp$, and
$H_{TT}$ exist for tensor-polarized spin-1 hadrons. These multiparton
distribution functions are also interesting to probe multiparton correlations

explore the effect of a nanostructured back reflector to recycle the unabsorbed

from silicon that is readily integrated with the thin films. We numerically
obtain the optical properties by solving the 3D time-harmonic Maxwell equations
using the finite-element method, and model silicon with experimentally
determined optical constants. The absorption enhancement relevant for
photovoltaics is obtained by weighting the absorption spectra with the AM 1.5
standard solar spectrum. We study thin films either thicker ($L_{Si} = 2400$
nm) or much thinner ($L_{Si} = 80$ nm) than the wavelength of light. At $L_{Si}
= 2400$ nm, the 3D photonic band gap crystal enhances the spectrally averaged
($\lambda = 680$ nm to $880$ nm) silicon absorption by $2.22$x (s-pol.) to
$2.45$x (p-pol.), which exceeds the enhancement of a perfect metal back
reflector ($1.47$ to $1.56$x). The absorption is enhanced by the (i) broadband
angle and polarization-independent reflectivity in the 3D photonic band gap,
and (ii) the excitation of many guided modes in the film by the crystal's
surface diffraction leading to enhanced path lengths. At $L_{Si} = 80$ nm, the
photonic crystal back reflector yields a striking average absorption
enhancement of $9.15$x, much more than $0.83$x for a perfect metal, which is
due to a remarkable guided mode confined within the combined thickness of the
thin film and the photonic crystal's Bragg attenuation length. The broad
bandwidth of the 3D photonic band gap leads to the back reflector's Bragg
attenuation length being much shorter than the silicon absorption length.
Consequently, light is confined inside the thin film and the absorption
enhancements are not due to the additional thickness of the photonic crystal
back reflector.

many state-of-the-art label-noise learning methods. To exploit this property,
the early stopping trick, which stops the optimization at the early stage of
training, is usually adopted. Current methods generally decide the early
stopping point by considering a DNN as a whole. However, a DNN can be
considered as a composition of a series of layers, and we find that the latter
layers in a DNN are much more sensitive to label noise, while their former
counterparts are quite robust. Therefore, selecting a stopping point for the
whole network may make different DNN layers antagonistically affected each
other, thus degrading the final performance. In this paper, we propose to
separate a DNN into different parts and progressively train them to address
this problem. Instead of the early stopping, which trains a whole DNN all at
once, we initially train former DNN layers by optimizing the DNN with a
relatively large number of epochs. During training, we progressively train the
latter DNN layers by using a smaller number of epochs with the preceding layers
fixed to counteract the impact of noisy labels. We term the proposed method as
progressive early stopping (PES). Despite its simplicity, compared with the
early stopping, PES can help to obtain more promising and stable results.
Furthermore, by combining PES with existing approaches on noisy label training,
we achieve state-of-the-art performance on image classification benchmarks.

it displays the hallmark T-linear resistivity and a T log(1/T) electronic heat

related to any critical fluctuations. Here we use inelastic neutron scattering
to reveal the presence of collective spin fluctuations whose relaxation time

Well-calibrated multiband optical photometric data (from $-$0.2 to +413 d since
$B$-band maximum) were used to compute the bolometric light curve and to
perform semi-analytical light-curve modelling using the $\texttt{MINIM}$ code.
A spin-down millisecond magnetar-powered model explains the observed
photometric evolution of SN 2012au reasonably. Early-time imaging polarimetric
follow-up observations ($-$2 to +31 d) and comparison with other similar cases
indicate signatures of asphericity in the ejecta. Good spectral coverage of SN
2012au (from $-$5 to +391 d) allows us to trace the evolution of layers of SN
ejecta in detail. SN 2012au exhibits higher line velocities in comparison with
other SNe Ib. Late nebular phase spectra of SN 2012au indicate a Wolf$-$Rayet
star as the possible progenitor for SN 2012au, with oxygen, He-core, and
main-sequence masses of $\sim$1.62 $\pm$ 0.15 M$_\odot$, $\sim$4$-$8 M$_\odot$,
and $\sim$17$-$25 M$_\odot$, respectively. There is a clear absence of a first
overtone of carbon monoxide (CO) features up to +319 d in the $K$-band region
of the NIR spectra. Overall analysis suggests that SN 2012au is one of the most
luminous slow-decaying Type Ib SNe, having comparatively higher ejecta mass
($\sim$4.7$-$8.3 M$_\odot$) and kinetic energy ($\sim$[4.8 $-$ 5.4] $\times$
10$^{51}$ erg). Detailed modelling using $\texttt{MESA}$ and the results
obtained through $\texttt{STELLA}$ and $\texttt{SNEC}$ explosions also strongly
support spin-down of a magnetar with mass of around 20 M$_\odot$ and
metallicity Z = 0.04 as a possible powering source of SN 2012au.

reformulation generates an optimal adversary in the function space of the

first stage, we train a deceptive policy by hacking the environment, and
discover a set of trajectories routing to the lowest reward or the worst-case
performance. Next, the adversary misleads the victim to imitate the deceptive
policy by perturbing the observations. Compared to existing approaches, we
theoretically show that our adversary is stronger under an appropriate noise

timed movement actions in robotic systems under specific consideration of
temporal stabilization, that is maintaining an approximately constant overall
movement time (isochronous behavior). This is demonstrated both in simulation
and on a physical robotic system for the task of intercepting a moving target
in three-dimensional space. Motivated from humanoid motion, timing plays a
vital role to generate a naturalistic behavior in interaction with the dynamic
environment as well as adaptively planning and executing action sequences
on-line. In biological systems, many of the physiological and anatomical
functions follow a particular level of periodicity and stabilization, which
exhibit a certain extent of resilience against external disturbances. A main
aspect thereof is stabilizing movement timing against limited perturbations.
Especially human arm movement, namely when it is tasked to reach a certain goal
point, pose or configuration, shows a stabilizing behavior. This work
incorporates the utilization of an extended Kalman filter (EKF) which was
implemented to predict the target position while coping with non-linear system
dynamics. The periodicity and temporal stabilization in biological systems was
artificially generated by a Hopf oscillator, yielding a sinusoidal velocity
profile for smooth and repeatable motion.

this paper we discuss a generalisation of the newsvendor model with piece-wise

stochastic demand has been assumed to follow a completely unknown probability
distribution. Subsequently, non-parametric estimator of the optimal order

using a random sample on demand. Strong consistency of the estimator has been
proven when the true optimal order quantity is unique. The result has been
extended to the case where multiple solutions for optimal order quantity are

been studied through extensive simulation experiments. Simulation results
indicate that the non-parametric method provides robust yet efficient estimator
of the optimal order quantity in terms of mean square error.

iterative method for Eikonal equation in two novel ways, in the value update

iterative method in that we selectively update the points, chosen by a
convergence measure, in the active list. However, in order to reduce running
time, the improved algorithm does not run a convergence check of the
neighboring points of the narrow band as the fast iterative method usually
does. The additional error correction step is to correct the errors that the
previous value update step may cause. The error correction step consists of
finding and recalculating the point values in a separate remedy list which is
quite easy to implement on a GPU. In contrast to the fast marching method and
the fast sweeping method for the Eikonal equation, our improved method does not
need to compute the solution with any special ordering in neither the remedy
list nor the active list. Therefore, our algorithm can be implemented in

hydrogen-rich phases exhibited superconducting transition above 100 K have been
discovered to date. There is a widely accepted theoretical point of view that
primary mechanism governing the emergence of superconductivity in hydrogen-rich
phases is the electron-phonon pairing. However, our recent analysis of
experimental temperature dependent resistance in $H_{3}S$, $LaH_{x}$, $PrH_{9}$
and $BaH_{12}$ (arXiv: 2104.14145) showed that these compounds exhibit the
dominance of non-electron-phonon charge carrier interaction and, thus, it is
unlikely that the electron-phonon pairing is the primary mechanism for the
emergence of superconductivity in these materials. Here we use the same
approach to reveal charge carrier interaction in highly-compressed lithium,
black phosphorous, sulfur, and silane. We found that all these superconductors
exhibit the dominance of non-electron-phonon charge carrier interaction. This
explains the failure of high-Tc values predicted for these materials by the
first-principles calculations which utilized the electron-phonon pairing as the
mechanism for the emergence of superconductivity in these materials. Our result
implies that alternative pairing mechanisms (i.e., electron-magnon,
electron-polaron, electron-electron, etc.) should be tested within

of superconductivity in highly-compressed superconductors.

the fact (already apparent in their Fig.~7, but not explicitly stated there)
that high-fraction nulling pulsars also tend to reside within this and an
additional stripe, we make the observation that the two stripes further match
the ""death lines"" for double and single-pole interpulses, associated with

are known to suffer from pair production deficiencies, so we propose to explain
intermittency and high-fraction nulling by reinvigorating some older quiescent

the polar potential drops below the two threshold bands (i.e., the two
stripes), corresponding to the aligned and orthogonal rotators, their
respective magnetospheres transition from being of the active
pair-production-sustained type into becoming the electrospheres, in which
charges are only lifted from the star. The borderline cases sitting in the gap
outside of the stable regime of either case manifest as high-fraction nullers.
Hall evolution of the magnetic field inside orthogonally rotating neutron stars

connection to the concurrence of the depolarizing channel density matrix, which
allows to characterize the features of the Uhlmann phase in terms of the degree
of entanglement in the system. In the space of field direction and coupling
parameter, it exhibits a phase singularity revealing a topological transition

lying in the equator of the sphere of directions and at critical values of the

resulting in a diffuse sound field. Since the spatially resolved perception of
individual diffuse reflections is impossible, simplifications can potentially
be made for modelling late reverberation in room acoustics simulations with
reduced spatial resolution. Such simplifications are desired for interactive,
real-time virtual acoustic environments with applications in hearing research
and for the evaluation of hearing supportive devices. In this context, the
number and spatial arrangement of loudspeakers used for playback additionally
affect spatial resolution. The current study assessed the minimum number of
spatially evenly distributed virtual late reverberation sources required to
perceptually approximate spatially highly resolved isotropic and anisotropic
late reverberation and to technically approximate a spherically isotropic
diffuse sound field. The spatial resolution of the rendering was systematically
reduced by using subsets of the loudspeakers of an 86-channel spherical
loudspeaker array in an anechoic chamber. It was tested whether listeners can
distinguish lower spatial resolutions for the rendering of late reverberation
from the highest achievable spatial resolution in different simulated rooms.
Rendering of early reflections was kept fixed. The coherence of the sound field
across a pair of microphones at ear and behind-the-ear hearing device distance
was assessed to separate the effects of number of virtual sources and
loudspeaker array geometry. Results show that between 12 and 24 reverberation

where already changes to single pixels in a video frame can potentially lead to
completely different decisions with dangerous consequences. In this paper, a
structured analysis has been conducted to explore video degradation effects on
the performance of an ML-enabled pedestrian detector. Firstly, a baseline of
applying YOLO to 1,026 frames with pedestrian annotations in the KITTI Vision
Benchmark Suite has been established. Next, video degradation candidates for
each of these frames were generated using the leading video codecs libx264,
libx265, Nvidia HEVC, and AV1: 52 frames for the various compression presets
for color and gray-scale frames resulting in 104 degradation candidates per
original KITTI frame and 426,816 images in total. YOLO was applied to each
image to compute the intersection-over-union (IoU) metric to compare the
performance with the original baseline. While aggressively lossy compression
settings result in significant performance drops as expected, it was also
observed that some configurations actually result in slightly better IoU

comprised of sensors and actuators that actively participate in sensing,

frequently deployed in hostile environments, wherein adversaries attempt to
capture and breach them in order to seize control of the entire network. One
such example of potentially malicious behaviour is the cloning of IoT devices,
in which an attacker can physically capture the devices, obtain some sensitive
information, duplicate the devices, and intelligently deploy them in desired
locations to conduct various insider attacks. A device cloning attack on IoT
networks is a significant security concern since it allows for selective
forwarding, sink-hole, and black-hole attacks. To address this issue, this
paper provides an efficient scheme for detecting clone node attacks on IoT
networks that makes use of semantic information about IoT devices known as
context information sensed from the deployed environment to locate them
securely. We design a location proof mechanism by combining location proofs and
batch verification of the extended elliptic curve digital signature technique
to accelerate the verification process at selected trusted nodes. We
demonstrate the security of our scheme and its resilience to secure clone node

analysis of non-overlapping patches outperforms pixelwise segmentation
approaches, but still leaves room for optimization. Furthermore, the division
into patches, regardless of the biological structures they contain, is a
drawback due to the loss of local dependencies. We propose to subdivide the WSI
into coherent regions prior to classification by grouping visually similar
adjacent pixels into superpixels. Afterwards, only a random subset of patches
per superpixel is classified and patch labels are combined into a superpixel
label. We propose a metric for identifying superpixels with an uncertain
classification and evaluate two medical applications, namely tumor area and
invasive margin estimation and tumor composition analysis. The algorithm has
been developed on 159 hand-annotated WSIs of colon resections and its
performance is compared to an analysis without prior segmentation. The
algorithm shows an average speed-up of 41% and an increase in accuracy from
93.8% to 95.7%. By assigning a rejection label to uncertain superpixels, we
further increase the accuracy by 0.4%. Whilst tumor area estimation shows high
concordance to the annotated area, the analysis of tumor composition highlights
limitations of our approach. By combining superpixel segmentation and patch

their host galaxies. However, current methods used to directly measure black
hole masses in active quasars become challenging or impossible beyond
$z\gtrsim0.2$. Spectroastrometry (SA) measures the spatial centroid of an
object's spectrum as a function of wavelength, delivering angular resolution
far better than the point-spread function (PSF) for high signal-to-noise ratio
observations. We observed the luminous quasar SDSS J212329.47--005052.9 at
$z=2.279$ with the aim of resolving its $\sim100\mu\mathrm{as}$ H$\alpha$ broad
emission-line region (BLR), and present the first SA constraints on the size
and kinematic structure of the BLR. Using a novel pipeline to extract the SA
signal and reliable uncertainties, we achieved a centroiding precision of
$\simeq100\mu\mathrm{as}$, or $>2000\times$ smaller than the $K$-band
AO-corrected PSF, yielding a tentative $3.2\sigma$ detection of an SA signal

disk with a mixture of coherent and random motions we constrain
$r_\mathrm{BLR}=454^{+565}_{-162}\,\mu\mathrm{as}$

limit on the black hole mass $M_\mathrm{BH}\,\sin^2\,i \leq1.8
\times10^9\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. Our results agree with the $r_\mathrm{BLR}-L$
relation measured for lower-$z$ quasars, but expands its dynamic range by an
order of magnitude in luminosity. We did not detect the potentially stronger SA
signal from the narrow-line region, but discuss in detail why it may be absent.
Already with existing instrumentation, SA can deliver $\sim6\times$ smaller

solution, i.e. an ordered set of jobs, has to be improved as much as possible

contexts, e.g. due to changes in the job data or because of the local objective
in a stage of a supply chain \red{that is} not aligned with the given sequence.
A common production setting entails the movement of jobs (or parts) on a
conveyor. This is reflected in our model by facilitating the re-sequencing of
jobs via a buffer of limited capacity accessible by a LIFO policy. We consider
the classical objective functions of total weighted completion time, maximum
lateness and (weighted) number of late jobs and study their complexity. For
three of these problems we present strictly polynomial-time dynamic programming
algorithms, while for the case of minimizing the weighted number of late jobs
NP-hardness is proven and a pseudo-polynomial algorithm is given.

complex series of deep eclipses over 56 days. This was attributed to the
transit of a ring system filling a large fraction of the Hill sphere of an
unseen substellar companion. Subsequent photometric monitoring has not found
any other deep transits from this candidate ring system, but if there are more
substellar companions and they are coplanar with the potential ring system,
there is a chance that they will transit the star as well. This young star is
active and the light curves show a 5% modulation in amplitude with a dominant
rotation period of 3.2 days due to star spots rotating in and out of view. We
model and remove the rotational modulation of the J1407 light curve and search
for additional transit signatures of substellar companions orbiting around
J1407. We combine the photometry of J1407 from several observatories, spanning
a 19 year baseline. We remove the rotational modulation by modeling the
variability as a periodic signal, whose periodicity changes slowly with time
over several years due to the activity cycle of the star. A Transit Least
Squares (TLS) analysis searches for any periodic transiting signals within the
cleaned light curve. We identify an activity cycle of J1407 with a period of
5.4 years. A Transit Least Squares search does not find any plausible periodic
eclipses in the light curve, from 1.2% amplitude at 5 days up to 1.9% at 20
days. This sensitivity is confirmed by injecting artificial transits into the
light curve and determining the recovery fraction as a function of transit
depth and orbital period. J1407 is confirmed as a young active star with an
activity cycle consistent with a rapidly rotating solar mass star. With the
rotational modulation removed, the TLS analysis rules out transiting companions
with radii larger than about 1 Jupiter.

many continuous time chaotic systems and has been attributed to the presence of
Lorentzian-shaped pulses in the time series of the dynamical variables. Here a
stochastic model of such fluctuations is presented, describing these as a
super-position of pulses with fixed shape and constant duration. Closed form
expressions are derived for the lowest order moments, auto-correlation function
and frequency power spectral density in the case of periodic pulse arrivals and
a random distribution of pulse amplitudes. In general, the spectrum is a Dirac
comb located at multiples of the inverse periodicity time and modulated by the
pulse spectrum. For Lorentzian-shaped pulses there is an exponential modulation
of the Dirac comb. Deviations from strict periodicity in the arrivals
efficiently removes the Dirac comb, leaving only the spectrum of the pulse
function. This effect is also achieved if the pulse amplitudes are independent
of the arrivals and have vanishing mean value. Randomness in the pulse arrival
times is investigated by numerical realizations of the process, and the model
is used to describe the power spectral densities of time series from the Lorenz
system.

network of multiple decentralized edge devices without requiring the exchange

that agents (e.g., mobile devices) faithfully execute the intended algorithm,

use risk bounds to analyze how the key feature of federated learning,
unbalanced and non-i.i.d. data, affects agents' incentives to voluntarily
participate and obediently follow traditional federated learning algorithms. To
be more specific, our analysis reveals that agents with less typical data
distributions and relatively more samples are more likely to opt out of or
tamper with federated learning algorithms. To this end, we formulate the first
faithful implementation problem of federated learning and design two faithful
federated learning mechanisms which satisfy economic properties, scalability,
and privacy. Further, the time complexity of computing all agents' payments in
the number of agents is $\mathcal{O}(1)$. First, we design a Faithful Federated
Learning (FFL) mechanism which approximates the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG)
payments via an incremental computation. We show that it achieves (probably
approximate) optimality, faithful implementation, voluntary participation, and
some other economic properties (such as budget balance). Second, by
partitioning agents into several subsets, we present a scalable VCG mechanism
approximation. We further design a scalable and Differentially Private FFL
(DP-FFL) mechanism, the first differentially private faithful mechanism, that
maintains the economic properties. Our mechanism enables one to make three-way

assessing the psychoacoustic measures in isolated consecutive measurements

process, thus requiring restoration. In this paper, we propose two graph signal
restoration methods based on deep algorithm unrolling (DAU). First, we present
a graph signal denoiser by unrolling iterations of the alternating direction
method of multiplier (ADMM). We then suggest a general restoration method for
linear degradation by unrolling iterations of Plug-and-Play ADMM (PnP-ADMM). In
the second approach, the unrolled ADMM-based denoiser is incorporated as a
submodule, leading to a nested DAU structure. The parameters in the proposed
denoising/restoration methods are trainable in an end-to-end manner. Our
approach is interpretable and keeps the number of parameters small since we
only tune graph-independent regularization parameters. We overcome two main
challenges in existing graph signal restoration methods: 1) limited performance
of convex optimization algorithms due to fixed parameters which are often
determined manually. 2) large number of parameters of graph neural networks
that result in difficulty of training. Several experiments for graph signal
denoising and interpolation are performed on synthetic and real-world data. The
proposed methods show performance improvements over several existing techniques
in terms of root mean squared error in both tasks.

The results show that there exists a large first-level and second-level digital

where positive labeling results are carefully examined to ensure their
reliability but there can be other positive instances, i.e., cells of interest,

lack of knowledge about true negative samples. Most existing methods simply
treat instances that are not labeled as positive as truly negative during
network training, which can adversely affect the network performance. In this
work, to address the problem of incomplete annotations, we formulate the
training of detection networks as a positive-unlabeled learning problem.
Specifically, the classification loss in network training is revised to take
into account incomplete annotations, where the terms corresponding to negative
samples are approximated with the true positive samples and the other samples
of which the labels are unknown. To evaluate the proposed method, experiments
were performed on a publicly available dataset for mitosis detection in breast
cancer cells, and the experimental results show that our method improves the
performance of cell detection given incomplete annotations for training.

(2) an interface module that exposes relevant outputs from ASR, and (3) a
natural language understanding (NLU) module. Interfaces in SLU systems carry
information on text transcriptions or richer information like neural embeddings
from ASR to NLU. In this paper, we study how interfaces affect joint-training
for spoken language understanding. Most notably, we obtain the state-of-the-art
results on the publicly available 50-hr SLURP dataset. We first leverage
large-size pretrained ASR and NLU models that are connected by a text
interface, and then jointly train both models via a sequence loss function. For
scenarios where pretrained models are not utilized, the best results are
obtained through a joint sequence loss training using richer neural interfaces.
Finally, we show the overall diminishing impact of leveraging pretrained models
with increased training data size.

based on CAE, which outputs several labels and the corresponding samples
recovered by the CAE. Extensive experimental results are used to show that the
CAE achieves state of the art to recognize outliers by finding almost all

that the output list contains the correct label for almost all adversaries and
the size of the output list is reasonably small.

state, we have observed persistent levels of infection after the first wave and
eventually the emergence of a second viral strain just before an augmented

after the first wave may be due to reinfection, whereas the higher peak at the
second wave can be explained by the emergence of the second variant and a low

the proposed model provides insights into the effect of reinfection and

on-chain, creating a ""trust gap"" to the physical, off-chain environment. This
is due to the lack of a scheme that can truthfully reflect the physical world

and generates anti-forgery data; and 2) a consistency protocol to upload the

real-time consistent, continuous and fault-tolerant fashion. Our security
analysis indicates that no adversary can tamper with the vaccine in any way
without being captured. We carry out an experiment to record the internal
status of a vaccine shipping box during transportation, and the results
indicate that the proposed system incurs an average latency of 84 ms in local
sensing and processing followed by an average latency of 130 ms to have the

TiN/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/SiO2/Si (MFIS) gate structure. We propose a method of
experimentally extracting the number of trapped charges during the memory
operation, by measuring the charges in the metal gate and Si substrate. We
verify that the amount of trapped charges increases during the endurance
fatigue process. This is the first time that the trapped charges are directly
experimentally extracted and verified to increase during endurance fatigue.
Moreover, we model the interplay between the trapped charges and ferroelectric
polarization switching during endurance fatigue. Through the consistency of
experimental results and simulated data, we demonstrate that as the memory
window decreases: 1) The ferroelectric characteristic of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 is not
degraded. 2) The trap density in the upper bandgap of the gate stacks
increases. 3) The reason for memory window decrease is increased trapped
electrons after program operation but not related to hole trapping/de-trapping.
Our work is helpful to study the charge trapping behavior of FeFET and the
related endurance fatigue process.

recently. The rapid development of vision transformers is mainly contributed by
their high representation ability for extracting informative features from
input images. However, the mainstream transformer models are designed with deep
architectures, and the feature diversity will be continuously reduced as the
depth increases, i.e., feature collapse. In this paper, we theoretically
analyze the feature collapse phenomenon and study the relationship between
shortcuts and feature diversity in these transformer models. Then, we present
an augmented shortcut scheme, which inserts additional paths with learnable
parameters in parallel on the original shortcuts. To save the computational
costs, we further explore an efficient approach that uses the block-circulant
projection to implement augmented shortcuts. Extensive experiments conducted on
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which
brings about 1% accuracy increase of the state-of-the-art visual transformers

Without employing severe social-pressure against ""defectors"", or alternatively,
significantly rewarding ""cooperators"", theoretical models typically predict a
system collapse in a way that is reminiscent of the ""tragedy-of-the-commons""
metaphor. Drawing on a dynamic network model, this paper demonstrates how
cooperation can emerge when the social-pressure is mild. This is achieved with
the aid of an additional behavior called ""hypocritical"", which appears to be
cooperative from the external observer's perspective but in fact hardly
contributes to the social-welfare. Our model assumes that social-pressure is
induced over both defectors and hypocritical players, but the extent of which
may differ. Our main result indicates that the emergence of cooperation highly
depends on the extent of social-pressure applied against hypocritical players.
Setting it to be at some intermediate range below the one employed against
defectors allows a system composed almost exclusively of defectors to transform
into a fully cooperative one quickly. Conversely, when the social-pressure
against hypocritical players is either too low or too high, the system remains
locked in a degenerate configuration.

it is the arbitrary number of instances that has made instance segmentation
much more challenging. In order to predict a mask for each instance, mainstream
approaches either follow the 'detect-then-segment' strategy (e.g., Mask R-CNN),
or predict embedding vectors first then cluster pixels into individual
instances. In this paper, we view the task of instance segmentation from a
completely new perspective by introducing the notion of ""instance categories"",
which assigns categories to each pixel within an instance according to the
instance's location. With this notion, we propose segmenting objects by
locations (SOLO), a simple, direct, and fast framework for instance
segmentation with strong performance. We derive a few SOLO variants (e.g.,
Vanilla SOLO, Decoupled SOLO, Dynamic SOLO) following the basic principle. Our
method directly maps a raw input image to the desired object categories and
instance masks, eliminating the need for the grouping post-processing or the
bounding box detection. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for
instance segmentation in terms of both speed and accuracy, while being
considerably simpler than the existing methods. Besides instance segmentation,
our method yields state-of-the-art results in object detection (from our mask
byproduct) and panoptic segmentation. We further demonstrate the flexibility
and high-quality segmentation of SOLO by extending it to perform one-stage
instance-level image matting. Code is available at: https://git.io/AdelaiDet

propose a very fast deep learning framework called Bringing the Lightness
(denoted as BLNet) that consists of two U-Nets with a series of well-designed
loss functions to tackle all of the above degradations. Based on Retinex
Theory, the decomposition net in our model can decompose low-light images into
reflectance and illumination and remove noise in the reflectance during the
decomposition phase. We propose a Noise and Color Bias Control module (NCBC
Module) that contains a convolutional neural network and two loss functions
(noise loss and color loss). This module is only used to calculate the loss
functions during the training phase, so our method is very fast during the test
phase. This module can smooth the reflectance to achieve the purpose of noise
removal while preserving details and edge information and controlling color
bias. We propose a network that can be trained to learn the mapping between
low-light and normal-light illumination and enhance the brightness of images
taken in low-light illumination. We train and evaluate the performance of our
proposed model over the real-world Low-Light (LOL) dataset), and we also test
our model over several other frequently used datasets (LIME, DICM and MEF
datasets). We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our approach
achieves a promising effect with good rubustness and generalization and
outperforms many other state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and

network creation game. Network creation game, first introduced and studied by
Fabrikant et al., is a classic model for real-world networks from a
game-theoretic point of view. In a network creation game with n selfish vertex
agents, each vertex can build undirected edges incident to a subset of the
other vertices. The goal of every agent is to minimize its creation cost plus
its usage cost, where the creation cost is the unit edge cost $\alpha$ times
the number of edges it builds, and the usage cost is the sum of distances to
all other agents in the resulting network. The max-distance network creation
game, introduced and studied by Demaine et al., is a key variant of the
original game, where the usage cost takes into account the maximum distance
instead. The main result of this paper shows that for $\alpha > 19$ all
equilibrium graphs in the max-distance network creation game must be trees,
while the best bound in previous work is $\alpha > 129$. We also improve the
constant upper bound on the price of anarchy to 3 for tree equilibria. Our work
brings new insights into the structure of Nash equilibria and takes one step
forward in settling the so-called tree conjecture in the max-distance network

conditional models $p(x|z)$ and $q(z|x)$ that form a cycle. This is motivated
by the observation that deep generative models, in addition to a likelihood
model $p(x|z)$, often also use an inference model $q(z|x)$ for extracting
representation, but they rely on a usually uninformative prior distribution
$p(z)$ to define a joint distribution, which may render problems like posterior
collapse and manifold mismatch. To explore the possibility to model a joint
distribution using only $p(x|z)$ and $q(z|x)$, we study their compatibility and
determinacy, corresponding to the existence and uniqueness of a joint
distribution whose conditional distributions coincide with them. We develop a
general theory for operable equivalence criteria for compatibility, and
sufficient conditions for determinacy. Based on the theory, we propose a novel
generative modeling framework CyGen that only uses the two cyclic conditional
models. We develop methods to achieve compatibility and determinacy, and to use
the conditional models to fit and generate data. With the prior constraint
removed, CyGen better fits data and captures more representative features,

dynamics during cooling have been intensely studied, the evolution of the hot

To address this, we introduce a novel ultrafast visible pump - infrared push -
terahertz probe spectroscopy (PPP-THz) to monitor the real-time conductivity
dynamics of cooling carriers in methylammonium lead iodide. We find a decrease
in mobility upon optically depositing energy into the carriers, which is
typical of band-transport. Surprisingly, the conductivity recovery dynamics are
incommensurate with the intraband relaxation measured by an analogous
experiment with an infrared probe (PPP- IR), and exhibit a negligible
dependence on the density of hot carriers. These results and the kinetic
modelling reveal the importance of highly-localized lattice heating on the
mobility of the hot electronic states. This collective polaron-lattice
phenomenon may contribute to the unusual photophysics observed in MHPs and
should be accounted for in devices that utilize hot carriers.

particles were synthesized using green sustainable approach based on
co-precipitation of calcium chloride and sodium carbonate/bicarbonate at
different ratios in the presence of organic additives. The impact of salts
concentrations, reaction time, as well as organic additives was systematically
researched to achieve controllable and reliable design of CaCO3 particles. It
has been demonstrated that the crystallinity (vaterite or calcite phase) of
particles depends on the initial salts concentrations. The loading capacity of
prepared CaCO3 particles is determined by their surface properties such as
specific surface area, pore size and zeta-potential. Differently shaped CaCO3
particles (spheroids, ellipsoids, toroids) were used to evaluate their uptake
efficiency on the example of C6 glioma cells. The results show that the
ellipsoidal particles possess a higher probability for internalization by
cancer cells. All tested particles were also found to have a good

using the EB-iPic3D code, which models solar wind expansion self-consistently
within a fully kinetic semi-implicit approach. The simulation is initialized
with an electron velocity distribution function modeled after Parker Solar
Probe observations during its first perihelion at 0.166 au, consisting of a
dense core and an anti-sunward strahl. This distribution function is initially
stable with respect to kinetic instabilities. Expansion drives the solar wind
into successive regimes where whistler heat flux instabilities are triggered.
These instabilities produce sunward whistler waves initially characterized by
predominantly oblique propagation with respect to the interplanetary magnetic
field. The excited waves interact with the electrons via resonant scattering
processes. As a consequence, the strahl pitch angle distribution broadens and
its drift velocity reduces. Strahl electrons are scattered in the direction
perpendicular to the magnetic field, and an electron halo is formed. At a later
stage, resonant electron firehose instability is triggered and further affects
the electron temperature anisotropy as the solar wind expands. Wave-particle
interaction processes are accompanied by a substantial reduction of the solar
wind heat flux. The simulated whistler waves are in qualitative agreement with
observations in terms of wave frequencies, amplitudes and propagation angles.
Our work proposes an explanation for the observations of oblique and parallel
whistler waves in the solar wind. We conclude that solar wind expansion has to

insulator with a symmetry-lowering structural phase transition at 33\,K and a
canted antiferromagnetic ordering of $5d^1$ Re magnetic moments at 18\,K. Our
calculations confirm the existence of the proposed charge quadrupolar order and
discover an additional, previously hidden, ordered charge quadrupolar
component. By separately isolating the structural distortions and the
orientations of the magnetic dipoles, we determine the relationship between the
charge quadrupolar, structural and magnetic orders, finding that either a local
structural distortion or a specific magnetic dipole orientation is required to
lower the symmetry and enable the existence of charge quadrupoles. Our work
establishes the crystal structure -- magnetic dipole -- charge multipole
relationship in Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$ and related 5$d^1$ double perovskites, and
illustrates a method for separating and analyzing the contributions and

Type-I and Type-II. Type-II GCs are characterized by a blue- and a red- red
giant branch composed of stars with different metallicities, often coupled with
distinct abundances in the slow-neutron capture elements (s-elements). Here we
continue the chemical tagging of Type-II GCs by adding the two least-massive
clusters of this class, NGC1261 and NGC6934. Based on both spectroscopy and
photometry, we find that red stars in NGC1261 are slightly enhanced in [Fe/H]
by ~0.1 dex and confirm that red stars of NGC 6934 are enhanced in iron by ~0.2
dex. Neither NGC1261 nor NGC6934 show internal variations in the s-elements,
which suggests a GC mass threshold for the occurrence of s-process enrichment.
We found a significant correlation between the additional Fe locked in the red
stars of Type-II GCs and the present-day mass of the cluster. Nevertheless,
most Type II GCs retained a small fraction of Fe produced by SNe II, lower than
the 2%; NGC6273, M54 and omega Centauri are remarkable exceptions. In the
appendix, we infer for the first time chemical abundances of Lanthanum, assumed
as representative of the s-elements, in M54, the GC located in the nucleus of
the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy. Red-sequence stars are marginally enhanced in
[La/Fe] by 0.10\pm0.06 dex, in contrast with the large [La/Fe] spread of most
Type II GCs. We suggest that different processes are responsible for the
enrichment in iron and s-elements in Type-II GCs.

sampling in Bayesian inference. Its main workhorse is optimization over a

tail of the posterior leading to miscalibration and potential degeneracy.
Importance sampling (IS), on the other hand, is often used to fine-tune and
de-bias the estimates of approximate Bayesian inference procedures. The quality
of IS crucially depends on the choice of the proposal distribution. Ideally,
the proposal distribution has heavier tails than the target, which is rarely
achievable by minimizing the RKL. We thus propose a novel combination of
optimization and sampling techniques for approximate Bayesian inference by
constructing an IS proposal distribution through the minimization of a forward
KL (FKL) divergence. This approach guarantees asymptotic consistency and a fast
convergence towards both the optimal IS estimator and the optimal variational
approximation. We empirically demonstrate on real data that our method is
competitive with variational boosting and MCMC.

of the novelties of this paper is that we avoid the need for any training data.
We achieve this by incorporating the governing differential equations and an

dynamical power system at any discrete time step. The resulting
Runge-Kutta-based physics-informed neural networks (RK-PINNs) can yield up to

in order to deliver an optimal measurement signal without needing any
assumption on the processes underlying the individual error signals. We also
study an appropriate non-parametric approach for the estimation of the
asymptotic covariance matrix of the wavelet cross-covariance estimator which
has important applications beyond the scope of this work. The theoretical
properties of the proposed approach are studied and are supported by
simulations and real applications, indicating that this method represents an
appropriate and general tool for the construction of optimal virtual signals
that are particularly relevant for arrays of gyroscopes. Moreover, our results
can support the creation of optimal signals for other types of inertial sensors
other than gyroscopes as well as for redundant measurements in other domains

semantic segmentation, they lack on robustness against adversarial examples. To
counteract this exploit, often adversarial training is used. However, it is
known that adversarial training with weak adversarial attacks (e.g. using the
Fast Gradient Method) does not improve the robustness against stronger attacks.
Recent research shows that it is possible to increase the robustness of such
single-step methods by choosing an appropriate step size during the training.
Finding such a step size, without increasing the computational effort of
single-step adversarial training, is still an open challenge. In this work we
address the computationally particularly demanding task of semantic
segmentation and propose a new step size control algorithm that increases the
robustness of single-step adversarial training. The proposed algorithm does not
increase the computational effort of single-step adversarial training
considerably and also simplifies training, because it is free of
meta-parameter. We show that the robustness of our approach can compete with
multi-step adversarial training on two popular benchmarks for semantic
segmentation.

autonomous driving. However, most progress in semantic segmentation of urban
scenes is reported on standard scenarios, i.e., daytime scenes with favorable
illumination conditions. In practical applications, the outdoor weather and
illumination are changeable, e.g., cloudy and nighttime, which results in a
significant drop of semantic segmentation accuracy of CNN only trained with
daytime data. In this paper, we propose a novel generative adversarial network
(namely Mutual-GAN) to alleviate the accuracy decline when daytime-trained
neural network is applied to videos captured under adverse weather conditions.
The proposed Mutual-GAN adopts mutual information constraint to preserve
image-objects during cross-weather adaptation, which is an unsolved problem for
most unsupervised image-to-image translation approaches (e.g., CycleGAN). The
proposed Mutual-GAN is evaluated on two publicly available driving video
datasets (i.e., CamVid and SYNTHIA). The experimental results demonstrate that
our Mutual-GAN can yield visually plausible translated images and significantly
improve the semantic segmentation accuracy of daytime-trained deep learning

(CPF) scheduler aims to utilize the cheapest path (e.g. WiFi) before sending
packets over other paths (e.g. cellular). In this paper, we demonstrate that
using CPF with an MP-DCCP tunnel may lead to sub-optimal performance. This is
due to adverse interactions between the scheduler and end-to-end and tunnel
congestion control. Hence, we design the Adaptive Cheapest Path First (ACPF)

to the secondary path earlier. We implement ACPF over both TCP and DCCP
congestion controlled tunnels. Our evaluation shows that ACPF improves the
average throughput over CPF between 24% to 86%.

put inferences of this kind to the test, systematically evaluating how linear

we use linear interpolation to study the role played by individual layers and

  Meteorological Society",,"10.1002/qj.4236",,"physics.ao-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Extreme Precipitation Events (EPEs) can have devastating consequences such as
floods and landslides, posing a great threat to society and the economy.
Predicting such events long in advance can support the mitigation of negative
impacts. Here, we focus on EPEs over the Mediterranean, a region that is
frequently affected by such hazards. Previous work identified strong
connections between localized EPEs and large-scale atmospheric flow patterns,
affecting the weather over the entire Mediterranean. We analyze the predictive
skill of these patterns in the ECMWF extended-range forecasts and assess if and
where these patterns can be used for indirect predictions of EPEs, using the
Brier Skill Score. The results show that the ECMWF model provides skillful
predictions of the Mediterranean patterns up to 2 weeks in advance. Moreover,
using the forecasted patterns for indirect predictability of EPEs outperforms
the reference score up to about 10 days lead time for many locations.
Especially for high orography locations or coastal areas, like parts of western
Turkey, western Balkans, Iberian Peninsula and Morocco this limit extends from
11 to 14 days lead time. This study demonstrates that connections between
localized EPEs and large-scale patterns over the Mediterranean extend the
forecasting horizon of the model by over 3 days in many locations, in
comparison to forecasting based on the predicted precipitation. Thus, it is
beneficial to use the predicted patterns rather than the predicted
precipitation at longer lead times for EPEs forecasting. The model's
performance is also assessed from a user perspective, showing that the EPEs
forecasting based on the patterns increases the economic benefits at medium and
extended range lead times. Such information could support higher confidence in
the decision-making of various users, e.g., the agricultural sector and
(re)insurance companies.

missing observations. Following the success of deep learning-based models for
various sequence learning tasks, these models increasingly replace classic
approaches in object tracking applications for inferring the objects' motion
states. While traditional tracking approaches can deal with missing
observations, most of their deep counterparts are, by default, not suited for
this.
  Towards this end, this paper introduces a transformer-based approach for
handling missing observations in variable input length trajectory data. The
model is formed indirectly by successively increasing the complexity of the
demanded inference tasks. Starting from reproducing noise-free trajectories,
the model then learns to infer trajectories from noisy inputs. By providing
missing tokens, binary-encoded missing events, the model learns to in-attend to
missing data and infers a complete trajectory conditioned on the remaining
inputs. In the case of a sequence of successive missing events, the model then
acts as a pure prediction model. The abilities of the approach are demonstrated
on synthetic data and real-world data reflecting prototypical object tracking
scenarios.

a splitting technique for test functions in the Banach space of Lipschitz

that it is possible to artificially increase their values by modifying the

responses (RIR). Stimuli were auralized using the SOFE's loudspeakers in
anechoic space. The target was presented from the front or at 0$^\circ$

For a frontal sound source, detection thresholds decreased while adding the

to the Chinese language: glyph and pinyin, which carry significant syntax and
semantic information for language understanding. In this work, we propose
ChineseBERT, which incorporates both the {\it glyph} and {\it pinyin}
information of Chinese characters into language model pretraining. The glyph
embedding is obtained based on different fonts of a Chinese character, being
able to capture character semantics from the visual features, and the pinyin
embedding characterizes the pronunciation of Chinese characters, which handles
the highly prevalent heteronym phenomenon in Chinese (the same character has
different pronunciations with different meanings). Pretrained on large-scale
unlabeled Chinese corpus, the proposed ChineseBERT model yields significant
performance boost over baseline models with fewer training steps. The porpsoed
model achieves new SOTA performances on a wide range of Chinese NLP tasks,
including machine reading comprehension, natural language inference, text
classification, sentence pair matching, and competitive performances in named
entity recognition. Code and pretrained models are publicly available at

wireless networks thanks to its efficient handling of multipath environment.
However, it suffers from a poor peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) which
requires a large power backoff, degrading the power amplifier (PA) efficiency.
In this work, we propose to use a neural network (NN) at the transmitter to
learn a high-dimensional modulation scheme allowing to control the PAPR and
adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR). On the receiver side, a NN-based
receiver is implemented to carry out demapping of the transmitted bits. The two
NNs operate on top of OFDM, and are jointly optimized in and end-to-end manner
using a training algorithm that enforces constraints on the PAPR and ACLR.
Simulation results show that the learned waveforms enable higher information
rates than a tone reservation baseline, while satisfying predefined PAPR and
ACLR targets.

crowd flow prediction (STCFP) models. However, the difficulty of applying

weather, holiday, and points of interests) and context modeling techniques
across different scenarios. In this paper, we build a benchmark composed of
large-scale spatiotemporal crowd flow data, contextual data, and
state-of-the-art spatiotemporal prediction models. We conduct a comprehensive
experimental study to quantitatively investigate the generalizability of
different contextual features and modeling techniques in several urban crowd

important observations: (1) Using more contextual features may not always
result in better prediction with existing context modeling techniques; in
particular, the combination of holiday and temporal position can provide more
generalizable beneficial information than other contextual feature
combinations. (2) In context modeling techniques, using a gated unit to
incorporate raw contextual features into the state-of-the-art prediction model
has good generalizability. Besides, we also offer several suggestions about

fundamental in both conventional (graph analytics, scientific computing) and
emerging (sparse DNN, GNN) domains. Workload-balancing and parallel-reduction
are widely-used design principles for efficient SpMV. However, prior work fails
to resolve how to implement and adaptively use the two principles for SpMV/MM.
To overcome this obstacle, we first complete the implementation space with
optimizations by filling three missing pieces in prior work, including: (1) We
show that workload-balancing and parallel-reduction can be combined through a
segment-reduction algorithm implemented with SIMD-shuffle primitives. (2) We
show that parallel-reduction can be implemented in SpMM through loading the
dense-matrix rows with vector memory operations. (3) We show that vectorized
loading of sparse rows, being a part of the benefit of parallel-reduction, can
co-exist with sequential-reduction in SpMM through temporally caching
sparse-matrix elements in the shared memory. In terms of adaptive use, we
analyze how the benefit of two principles change with two characteristics from
the input data space: the diverse sparsity pattern and dense-matrix width. We
find the benefit of the two principles fades along with the increased total
workload, i.e. the increased dense-matrix width. We also identify, for SpMV and
SpMM, different sparse-matrix features that impact workload-balancing
effectiveness. Our design consistently exceeds cuSPARSE by 1.07-1.57x on
different GPUs and dense matrix width, and the kernel selection rules involve
5-12% performance loss compared with optimal choices. Our kernel is being
integrated into popular graph learning frameworks to accelerate GNN training.

an epidemic, spreading over a network, determines its final outcome. Research
in this topic has primarily concentrated on finding the seed configuration
which infects the most individuals. Although these optimal configurations give
insight into how the initial state affects the outcome of an epidemic, they are
unlikely to occur in real life. In this paper we identify two important seeding
scenarios, both motivated by historical data, that reveal a new complex
phenomenon. In one scenario, the seeds are concentrated on the central nodes of
a network, while in the second, they are spread uniformly in the population.
Comparing the final size of the epidemic started from these two initial
conditions through data-driven and synthetic simulations on real and modelled
geometric metapopulation networks, we find evidence for a switchover
phenomenon: When the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is close to its critical
value, more individuals become infected in the first seeding scenario, but for
larger values of $R_0$, the second scenario is more dangerous. We find that the
switchover phenomenon is amplified by the geometric nature of the underlying
network, and confirm our results via mathematically rigorous proofs, by mapping
the network epidemic processes to bond percolation. Our results expand on the
previous finding that in case of a single seed, the first scenario is always
more dangerous, and further our understanding why the sizes of consecutive
waves can differ even if their epidemic characters are similar.

will exhibit significant difference in non-Abelian topological classifications.
Up to now, there is scant research investigating the even-band non-Abelian
topological insulators. Here, we both theoretically explored and experimentally
realized a four-band PT (inversion and time-reversal) symmetric system, where
two new classes of topological charges as well as edge states are
comprehensively studied. We illustrate their difference from four-dimensional
rotation senses on the stereographically projected Clifford tori. We show the
evolution of bulk topology by extending the 1D Hamiltonian onto a 2D plane and
provide the accompanying edge state distributions following an analytical
method. Our work presents an exhaustive study of four-band non-Abelian
topological insulators and paves the way to other even band systems.

micro-scale region can vary greatly even with small altitude changes. For now,
drone operators must check the local weather conditions to ensure a safe and
successful flight. This task is often a part of pre-flight preparations. Since
flight conditions (and most important flight safety) are greatly affected by
weather, drone operators need a more accurate localized weather map reading for
the flight area. In this paper, we present the Arduino Sensor Integrated Drone
(ASID) with a built-in meteorological station that logs the weather conditions
in the vertical area where the drone will be deployed. ASID is an autonomous
drone-based system that monitors weather conditions for pre-flight preparation.
The operation of the ASID system is based on the Arduino microcontroller
running automatic flight profiles to record meteorological data such as
temperature, barometric pressure, humidity, etc. The Arduino microcontroller
also takes photos of the horizon for an objective assessment of the visibility,

asks for a sufficient reduction of the residual in the linear system. Such an
approach often leads to an unnecessary 'oversolving' of linear equations. In
this paper, an IPM that relies on an inner termination criterion not based on
the residual of the linear system is introduced and analyzed. Moreover, new
indicators for the early termination of the inner iterations are derived from a
deep understanding of IPM needs. The new technique has been adapted to the
Conjugate Gradient (CG) and to the Minimum Residual method (MINRES) applied in
the IPM context. The new criterion has been tested on a set of quadratic
optimization problems including compressed sensing, image processing and

compared to standard residual tests with variable tolerance. Evidence gathered

significant improvements in terms of inner (linear) iterations and those

from target examples via consistency regularization and hard pseudo-labeling.
Simultaneously, interpolated source examples are leveraged to align source
class conditional distributions through an interpolated version of the
supervised contrastive loss. This alignment leads to more general and
transferable features which further improves the generalization on the target
domain. Extensive experiments have been carried out on three standard
multi-source UDA datasets where our method reports state-of-the-art results.

optimization perspective to elaborate on why it usually suffers from
suboptimality. Then, we formulate the DVS problem as an optimization program
that maximizes the positive-sequence voltage magnitude at the point of common
coupling (PCC) subject to the current, active power, and stability constraints.
The program is inherently nonconvex due to the active power limits, of which
the global optimality is not guaranteed by off-the-shelf solvers. In this
context, we perform the optimality analysis to explore the global optimum
analytically. It is found that the unique global optimum has three
scenarios/stages (S1--S3), which depends on the specific relationship among
grid voltage, grid strength, as well as physical limits of IBRs. The
closed-form solutions in S1 and S3 are derived and the optimality conditions
for S2 are provided, which guarantees the optimality and compatibility with the
fast real-time control. We implement the optimum with a grid-connected

simulations are carried out under different scenarios to test our proposal and

Unfortunately, ice-sheet models suffer from a very strict time-step size
constraint, which for higher-order models constitutes a severe bottleneck since
in each time step a nonlinear and computationally demanding system of equations
has to be solved.
  In this study, stable time-step sizes are increased for a full-Stokes model
by implementing a so-called free-surface stabilization algorithm (FSSA).
Previously this stabilization has been used successfully in mantle-convection
simulations where a similar, but linear, viscous-flow problem is solved.
  By numerical investigation it is demonstrated that instabilities on the very
thin domains required for ice-sheet modeling behave differently than on the
equal-aspect-ratio domains the stabilization has previously been used on.
Despite this, and despite the nonlinearity of the problem, it is shown that it
is possible to adapt FSSA to work on idealized ice-sheet domains and increase
stable time-step sizes by at least one order of magnitude. The FSSA presented
is deemed accurate, efficient and straightforward to implement into existing
ice-sheet solvers.

expensive, and such real data, due to its inflexibility, offer us limited
opportunities to evaluate the system performance w.r.t changing tracking
scenarios. In this paper, we study whether 3D synthetic data can replace
real-world videos for association training. Specifically, we introduce a
large-scale synthetic data engine named MOTX, where the motion characteristics
of cameras and objects are manually configured to be similar to those in
real-world datasets. We show that compared with real data, association
knowledge obtained from synthetic data can achieve very similar performance on
real-world test sets without domain adaption techniques. Our intriguing
observation is credited to two factors. First and foremost, 3D engines can well
simulate motion factors such as camera movement, camera view and object
movement, so that the simulated videos can provide association modules with
effective motion features. Second, experimental results show that the
appearance domain gap hardly harms the learning of association knowledge. In
addition, the strong customization ability of MOTX allows us to quantitatively
assess the impact of motion factors on MOT, which brings new insights to the

their inherent scale-dependence; in other words, the measured value depends on
the way it was measured. Here we take advantage of this scale-dependence to
develop a new framework for characterizing rough surfaces: the Scale-Dependent
Roughness Parameters (SDRP) analysis that yields slope, curvature and
higher-order derivatives of surface topography at many scales, even on a single
topography measurement. We demonstrate the relationship between SDRP and other
common statistical methods for analyzing surfaces: the height-difference
autocorrelation function (ACF), variable bandwidth methods (VBMs) and the power
spectral density (PSD). We use computer-generated and measured topographies to
demonstrate the benefits of SDRP analysis, including: novel metrics for
characterizing surfaces across scales, and the detection of measurement
artifacts. The SDRP is a generalized framework for scale-dependent analysis of
surface topography that yields metrics that are intuitively understandable.

computationally challenging. We employ an unfitted Finite Element (FE)
framework for the discretization of the domains and develop a tailored,
globally convergent, and efficient multigrid method for solving contact
problems on the internal interfaces. In the unfitted FE methods, structured
background meshes are used and only the underlying finite element space has to
be modified to incorporate the discontinuities. The non-penetration conditions
on the embedded interfaces of the domains are discretized using the method of
Lagrange multipliers. We reformulate the arising variational inequality problem
as a quadratic minimization problem with linear inequality constraints. Our
multigrid method can solve such problems by employing a tailored multilevel
hierarchy of the FE spaces and a novel approach for tackling the discretized
non-penetration conditions. We employ pseudo-$L^2$ projection-based transfer
operators to construct a hierarchy of nested FE spaces from the hierarchy of
non-nested meshes. The essential component of our multigrid method is a
technique that decouples the linear constraints using an orthogonal
transformation of the basis. The decoupled constraints are handled by a
modified variant of the projected Gauss-Seidel method, which we employ as a
smoother in the multigrid method. These components of the multigrid method
allow us to enforce linear constraints locally and ensure the global
convergence of our method. We will demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and

$(jk)^{O(\min(j,k))} (\epsilon^{-1} d \log n)^2$, where $n$ is the number of

previously demonstrate that planetary accretion flows of $>$ a few ten km

understand the accretion process of proto-giant planets from observations of
such shock-originated emission because of a huge gap in scale between the
circumplanetary disk (CPD) and the microscopic accretion shock. To overcome the
scale gap problem, we combine two-dimensional, high-spatial-resolution global
hydrodynamic simulations and the one-dimensional local radiation hydrodynamic
model of the shock-heated flow. From such combined simulations for the
protoplanet-CPD system, we find that the H$\alpha$ emission is mainly produced
in localized areas on the protoplanetary surface. The accretion shocks above
CPD produce much weaker H$\alpha$ emission (approximately 1-2 orders of
magnitude smaller in luminosity). Nevertheless, the accretion shocks above CPD
significantly affect the accretion process onto the protoplanet. The accretion
occurs at a quasi-steady rate, if averaged on a 10-day timescale, but its rate
shows variability on shorter timescales. The disk surface accretion layers
including the CPD-shocks largely fluctuate, which results in the time-variable
accretion rate and H$\alpha$ luminosity of the protoplanet. We also model the
spectral emission profile of the H$\alpha$ line and find that the line profile
is less time-variable, despite the large variability in luminosity.
High-spectral resolution spectroscopic observation and monitoring will be key
to reveal the property of the accretion process.

first one is the phenomenological approach proposed by Rudjord et al
\cite{entropy1} and expanded by Romero et al in \cite{entropy2}, which is a
purely geometric method of measuring gravitational entropy. The latter one is
the Clifton-Ellis-Tavakol (CET) proposal \cite{CET} for the gravitational
entropy which arises in relativistic thermodynamics and is based on the
Bel-Robinson tensor, which represents the effective super-energy-momentum
tensor of free gravitational fields. Considering some of the Lorentzian
traversable wormholes along with the Brill solution for NUT wormholes and the
AdS wormholes, we have evaluated the gravitational entropy for these systems.
Incidentally, the application of the CET proposal can provide unique
gravitational entropies for spacetimes of Petrov type D and N only, whereas the
geometric method can be applied to almost every kind of spacetime, although it
has no relation with thermodynamics. For any traversable wormhole to be
physically realistic, it should have a viable GE. We found that the GE
proposals do give us a consistent measure of GE in several of them. This means
that the existence of a viable gravitational entropy strictly depends on its
definition.

evolution of the disk. Observations have shown that this relation has a large
scatter which can not be explained by observational errors only. That scatter
is hence attributed to the effects of radial migration in which stars tracing
different chemical evolution histories in the disk get mixed. However, the
recent study of Nissen et al. 2020, using high precision observational data of
solar type stars, found two relatively tight age-metallicity relations. One
sequence of older and metal-richer stars probably traces the chemical
enrichment history of the inner disk while the other sequence of younger and
metal-poorer stars the chemical enrichment history of the outer disk. If
uncertainties in age measurements increase, these sequences mix explaining the
scatter of the one relation observed in other studies. This work follows up on
these results, by analysing an independent sample of red clump giants observed
by APOGEE. Since ages for red giants are significantly more uncertain, the
[C/N] ratios are considered as a proxy for age. This larger dataset is used to
investigate these relations at different Galactic radii, finding that these
distinct sequences exist only in the solar neighbourhood. The APOGEE dataset is
further used to explore different abundance and kinematical planes to shed

does not require the population graph to be a spanning tree or the covariance

practices in New York City (NYC) using geographic regression discontinuity

arrest rates. The standard geographic regression discontinuity design relies on
continuity assumptions of the potential outcome surface or a local
randomization assumption within a window around the boundary. These
assumptions, however, can easily be violated in realistic applications. We
develop a novel and robust approach to testing whether there are differences in
policing outcomes that are caused by differences in police precincts across
NYC. In particular, our test is robust to violations of the assumptions
traditionally made in geographic regression discontinuity designs and is valid
under weaker assumptions. We use a unique form of resampling to identify new
geographic boundaries that are known to have no treatment effect, which
provides a valid estimate of our test statistic's null distribution even under
violations of standard assumptions. We find that this procedure gives
substantially different results in the analysis of NYC arrest rates than those
that rely on standard assumptions.

performed quite well, where the ensemble model (EmoXNet) helped to achieve

cross-modal semantic alignment by exploiting temporal adjacent network in a

self-supervising. Extensive experiments are conducted on three widely used

Spectrometer (EIS) is the presence of upflows at the edges of active regions.
As active regions are magnetically connected to the large-scale field of the

corona. Here we examine the driving mechanism(s) of the very strong upflows
with velocities in excess of 70 km/s, known as blue-wing asymmetries, observed
during the eruption of a flux rope in AR 10977 (eruptive flare
SOL2007-12-07T04:50). We use Hinode/EIS spectroscopic observations combined
with magnetic-field modeling to investigate the possible link between the
magnetic topology of the active region and the strong upflows. A Potential
Field Source Surface (PFSS) extrapolation of the large-scale field shows a
quadrupolar configuration with a separator lying above the flux rope. Field
lines formed by induced reconnection along the separator before and during the
flux-rope eruption are spatially linked to the strongest blue-wing asymmetries
in the upflow regions. The flows are driven by the pressure gradient created
when the dense and hot arcade loops of the active region reconnect with the
extended and tenuous loops overlying it. In view of the fact that separator
reconnection is a specific form of the more general quasi-separatrix (QSL)
reconnection, we conclude that the mechanism driving the strongest upflows is,
in fact, the same as the one driving the persistent upflows of approx. 10 - 20

of templates in a search for continuous gravitational waves from the low-mass
X-Ray binary Scorpius X-1. Efficient placement of templates to cover the
parameter space at a given maximum mismatch is an application of the sphere
covering problem, for which an implementation is available in the LatticeTiling
software library. In the case of Sco X-1, potential correlations, in both the
prior uncertainty and the mismatch metric, between the orbital period and
orbital phase, lead to complications in the efficient construction of the
lattice. We define a shearing coordinate transformation which simultaneously
minimizes both of these sources of correlation, and allows us to take advantage
of the small prior orbital period uncertainty. The resulting lattices have a
factor of about 3 fewer templates than the corresponding parameter space grids
constructed by the prior straightforward method, allowing a more sensitive
search at the same computing cost and maximum mismatch.

the $k$-means objective. This improves over the previous best upper bounds of
$O(k)$ and $O(k^2)$, respectively, and nearly matches the previous $\Omega(\log

recent results obtained by NICER from the analyses of PSR J0740+6620 suggest a
rather stiff equation of state and the expected kilonova signal is therefore
strong, at least if the mass of the Black Hole does not exceed $\sim 10

the orbit is prograde. We compare the predictions obtained by considering
equations of state of neutron star matter satisfying the most recent
observations and assuming that only one family of compact stars exists with the
results predicted in the two-families scenario. In the latter a soft hadronic
equation of state produces very compact stellar objects while a rather stiff
quark matter equation of state produces massive strange quark stars, satisfying
NICER results. The expected kilonova signal in the two-families scenario is
very weak: in particular the Hadronic Star - Black Hole merger produces a much
weaker signal than in the one-family scenario because the hadronic equation of
state is very soft. Moreover, according to the only existing simulation, the
Strange Quark Star - Black Hole merger does not produce a kilonova signal
because the amount of mass ejected is negligible. These predictions will be
easily tested with the new generation of detectors if Black Holes with an

perturbation theory which allows for a reduction of the atomic dynamics to that
of an effective two-level atom, and for an implementation of the incoherent
effects that respects unitarity. Using a diagrammatic representation, we
identify and classify all the radiative processes. This allows us to compute
the scattered power, the spontaneous emission, and the stimulated emission, as
well as the total cross sections of extinction, absorption and scattering. We
find that, beside a general enhancement of the linewidth and an attenuation of
the spectral amplitudes, the pump reduces the nonradiative losses and provides
gains in the form of stimulated emission and incoherent radiation. For
sufficiently strong pump, gains and losses compensate, resulting in the
vanishing of extinction. In particular, for negligible nonradiative losses,
extinction vanishes for a pumping rate of $(1+\sqrt{5})/2$ times that of the
natural decay.

of systems and software modeling. The notion of validation refers to
representing a domain in a model accurately and generating results using an
executable model. In UML specifications, validation verifies the correctness of
UML diagrams against any constraints and rules defined within the model.
Currently, significant research has been conducted on generating test sets to
validate that UML diagrams conform to requirements. UML activity diagrams are a
specific focus of such efforts. An activity diagram is a flexible instrument
for describing a system s behaviors and the internal logic of complex
operations. This paper focuses on the notion of validation using activity
diagrams and contrasts that process with a proposed method that involves an
informal validation procedure. Accordingly, this informal validation involves
comparing requirements to specifications expressed by a diagram of a modeling
language called thinging machine (TM) modeling. The informal validation is a
type of model checking that requires the model to be small enough for the
verification to be done in a limited space or time period. In the proposed
method, the model diagram is divided into subdiagrams to achieve this purpose.
We claim the TM behavioral model comes with a particular dispositional
structure that allows a designer to carve a model into smaller components for
informal validation, which is shown through two case studies.

adaptively selecting the key frames. One important application of our proposed

task, particularly for rare abnormalities, requiring tremendous efforts from
medical experts. Artificial intelligence has become a popular tool for the
automatic processing of medical data, acting as a supportive tool for doctors.
However, the machine learning models used to build these tools are highly
dependent on the data used to train them. Large amounts of data can be
difficult to obtain in medicine due to privacy, expensive and time-consuming
annotations, and a general lack of data samples for infrequent lesions. Here,
we present a novel synthetic data generation pipeline, called SinGAN-Seg, to
produce synthetic medical images with corresponding masks using a single
training image. Our method is different from the traditional GANs because our
model needs only a single image and the corresponding ground truth to train.
Our method produces alternative artificial segmentation datasets with ground
truth masks when real datasets are not allowed to share. The pipeline is
evaluated using qualitative and quantitative comparisons between real and
synthetic data to show that the style transfer technique used in our pipeline
significantly improves the quality of the generated data and our method is
better than other state-of-the-art GANs to prepare synthetic images when the
size of training datasets are limited. By training UNet++ using both real and
the synthetic data generated from the SinGAN-Seg pipeline, we show that models
trained with synthetic data have very close performances to those trained on
real data when the datasets have a considerable amount of data. In contrast,
Synthetic data generated from the SinGAN-Seg pipeline can improve the
performance of segmentation models when training datasets do not have a
considerable amount of data. The code is available on GitHub.

proposed, which approximate the inner product rather than the gap. We prove
that the standard FW method using a $\delta$-approximate DMO converges as

$\mathcal{O}(L/(\delta^2 t))$ over a $\delta$-relaxation of the constraint set.
Furthermore, when the solution is on the boundary, a variant of FW converges as
$\mathcal{O}(1/t^2)$ under the quadratic growth assumption. Our empirical
results suggest that even these improved bounds are pessimistic, showing fast
convergence in recovering real-world images with graph-structured sparsity.

different phases with significantly different work functions. However, the

for a given application. Rather, it may be desirable to selectively grow a
kinetically trapped structure. In this work, we employ density functional
theory and transi-tion state theory to discuss under which conditions such a
kinetic trapping might be possible for the model system of TCNE on Cu.
Specifically, we want to trap the molecules in the first layer in a flat-lying
orientation. This requires temperatures that are sufficiently low to suppress
the re-orientation of the molecules, which is thermodynamically more favorable
for high dosages, but still high enough to enable ordered growth through
diffusion of molecules. Based on the temperature-dependent diffusion and
re-orientation rates, we propose a temperature range at which the
re-orientation can be successfully suppressed.

relationship between the label and a nuisance variable that is also correlated
with the covariates. For example, in classifying animals in natural images, the
background, which is a nuisance, can predict the type of animal. This
nuisance-label relationship does not always hold, and the performance of a
model trained under one such relationship may be poor on data with a different
nuisance-label relationship. To build predictive models that perform well
regardless of the nuisance-label relationship, we develop Nuisance-Randomized
Distillation (NURD). We introduce the nuisance-randomized distribution, a
distribution where the nuisance and the label are independent. Under this
distribution, we define the set of representations such that conditioning on
any member, the nuisance and the label remain independent. We prove that the
representations in this set always perform better than chance, while
representations outside of this set may not. NURD finds a representation from
this set that is most informative of the label under the nuisance-randomized
distribution, and we prove that this representation achieves the highest
performance regardless of the nuisance-label relationship. We evaluate NURD on
several tasks including chest X-ray classification where, using non-lung
patches as the nuisance, NURD produces models that predict pneumonia under
strong spurious correlations.

algorithmic fairness notions that rely on comparative principles is practically
difficult, making it necessary to rely on human auditor feedback. However, in
spite of taking rigorous training on various comparative fairness notions,
human auditors are known to disagree on various aspects of fairness notions in
practice, making it difficult to collect reliable feedback. This paper offers a
paradigm shift to the domain of algorithmic fairness via proposing a new
fairness notion based on the principle of non-comparative justice. In contrary
to traditional fairness notions where the outcomes of two individuals/groups
are compared, our proposed notion compares the MLS' outcome with a desired
outcome for each input. This desired outcome naturally describes a human
auditor's expectation, and can be easily used to evaluate MLS on crowd-auditing
platforms. We show that any MLS can be deemed fair from the perspective of
comparative fairness (be it in terms of individual fairness, statistical
parity, equal opportunity or calibration) if it is non-comparatively fair with
respect to a fair auditor. We also show that the converse holds true in the
context of individual fairness. Given that such an evaluation relies on the
trustworthiness of the auditor, we also present an approach to identify fair
and reliable auditors by estimating their biases with respect to a given set of
sensitive attributes, as well as quantify the uncertainty in the estimation of
biases within a given MLS. Furthermore, all of the above results are also
validated on COMPAS, German credit and Adult Census Income datasets.

layer is factorized into the product of a factor loading matrix and a topic
embedding matrix, the transpose of which is set as the factor loading matrix of
the layer above. Repeating this particular type of factorization, which shares
components between adjacent layers, leads to a structure referred to as
sawtooth factorization. An auto-encoding variational inference network is
constructed to optimize the model parameter via stochastic gradient descent.
Experiments on big corpora show that our models outperform other neural topic
models on extracting deeper interpretable topics and deriving better document
representations.

in adversarial machine learning addresses a significant threat to the wide
application of machine learning techniques -- they are vulnerable to carefully
crafted attacks from malicious adversaries. For example, deep neural networks
fail to correctly classify adversarial images, which are generated by adding
imperceptible perturbations to clean images.We first discuss three main
categories of attacks against machine learning techniques -- poisoning attacks,
evasion attacks, and privacy attacks. Then the corresponding defense approaches
are introduced along with the weakness and limitations of the existing defense
approaches. We notice adversarial samples in cybersecurity and computer vision
are fundamentally different. While adversarial samples in cybersecurity often
have different properties/distributions compared with training data,
adversarial images in computer vision are created with minor input
perturbations. This further complicates the development of robust learning
techniques, because a robust learning technique must withstand different types
of attacks.

others; the single and hybrid LSTM models did not exhibit a significant

predictive power of the LSTM model proved to be greater than that of the
SARIMAX-LSTM model. The LSTM, SARIMAX-SVR, and SARIMAX-LSTM models outperformed

  Brain Mapping",,,,,"q-bio.NC cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Brain graph synthesis marked a new era for predicting a target brain graph
from a source one without incurring the high acquisition cost and processing
time of neuroimaging data. However, existing multi-modal graph synthesis
frameworks have several limitations. First, they mainly focus on generating
graphs from the same domain (intra-modality), overlooking the rich multimodal
representations of brain connectivity (inter-modality). Second, they can only
handle isomorphic graph generation tasks, limiting their generalizability to
synthesizing target graphs with a different node size and topological structure
from those of the source one. More importantly, both target and source domains
might have different distributions, which causes a domain fracture between them
(i.e., distribution misalignment). To address such challenges, we propose an
inter-modality aligner of non-isomorphic graphs (IMANGraphNet) framework to
infer a target graph modality based on a given modality. Our three core
contributions lie in (i) predicting a target graph (e.g., functional) from a
source graph (e.g., morphological) based on a novel graph generative
adversarial network (gGAN); (ii) using non-isomorphic graphs for both source
and target domains with a different number of nodes, edges and structure; and
(iii) enforcing the predicted target distribution to match that of the ground
truth graphs using a graph autoencoder to relax the designed loss oprimization.
To handle the unstable behavior of gGAN, we design a new Ground
Truth-Preserving (GT-P) loss function to guide the generator in learning the
topological structure of ground truth brain graphs. Our comprehensive
experiments on predicting functional from morphological graphs demonstrate the
outperformance of IMANGraphNet in comparison with its variants. This can be
further leveraged for integrative and holistic brain mapping in health and
disease.

spiking neural networks (SNNs) for handling Euclidean-space tasks, it still
remains challenging to exploit SNNs in processing non-Euclidean-space data
represented by graph data, mainly due to the lack of effective modeling
framework and useful training techniques. Here we present a general spike-based
modeling framework that enables the direct training of SNNs for graph learning.
Through spatial-temporal unfolding for spiking data flows of node features, we
incorporate graph convolution filters into spiking dynamics and formalize a
synergistic learning paradigm. Considering the unique features of spike
representation and spiking dynamics, we propose a spatial-temporal feature
normalization (STFN) technique suitable for SNN to accelerate convergence. We
instantiate our methods into two spiking graph models, including graph
convolution SNNs and graph attention SNNs, and validate their performance on
three node-classification benchmarks, including Cora, Citeseer, and Pubmed. Our
model can achieve comparable performance with the state-of-the-art graph neural

benefits for the execution on neuromorphic hardware and prompting neuromorphic
