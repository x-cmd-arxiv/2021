tracking task and in the meanwhile fulfill some extra constraints, such as
tracking through an end-effector in designated orientation, or get rid of the
evitable manipulator-obstacle collision. Those constraints require rational
planning of the robot motion. In this work, we derived the compressible
curvature kinematics of a cable-driven soft robot which takes the compressible
soft segment into account. The motion planning of the soft robot for a
trajectory tracking task in constrained conditions, including fixed orientation
end-effector and manipulator-obstacle collision avoidance, has been
investigated. The inverse solution of cable actuation was formulated as a
damped least-square optimization problem and iteratively computed off-line. The
performance of trajectory tracking and the obedience to constraints were
evaluated via the simulation we made open-source, as well as the prototype
experiments. The method can be generalized to the similar multisegment
cable-driven soft robotic systems by customizing the robot parameters for the
prior motion planning of the manipulator.

qubit-based quantum error correction codes by Ollivier and Tillich in 2006.
Here we improve the scalability and practicality of their theory, show that it
has strong structure, extend the results using classical coding theory as a
guide, and demonstrate a canonical form from which the structural properties of
the decoding graph may be computed. The resulting formalism is valid for any
prime-dimensional quantum system. The modified decoder works for any stabilizer
code $S$ and separates into two parts: a one-time, offline computation which
builds a compact, graphical representation of the normalizer of the code,
$S^\perp$, and a quick, parallel, online query of the resulting vertices using
the Viterbi algorithm. We show the utility of trellis decoding by applying it
to four high-density, length 20 stabilizer codes for depolarizing noise and the
well-studied Steane, rotated surface, and 4.8.8/6.6.6 color codes for $Z$-only
noise. Numerical simulations demonstrate a 20\% improvement in the
code-capacity threshold for color codes with boundaries by avoiding the mapping
from color codes to surface codes. We identify trellis edge number as a key
metric of difficulty of decoding, allowing us to quantify the advantage of
single-axis decoding for Calderbank-Steane-Shor codes and block-decoding for
concatenated codes.

  the newest version and corrects some errors",,,"cs.SE cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Automated Program Repair (APR) helps improve the efficiency of software
development and maintenance. Recent APR techniques use deep learning,
particularly the encoder-decoder architecture, to generate patches. Though
existing DL-based APR approaches have proposed different encoder architectures,
the decoder remains to be the standard one, which generates a sequence of
tokens one by one to replace the faulty statement. This decoder has multiple
limitations: 1) allowing to generate syntactically incorrect programs, 2)
inefficiently representing small edits, and 3) not being able to generate
project-specific identifiers.
  In this paper, we propose Recoder, a syntax-guided edit decoder with
placeholder generation. Recoder is novel in multiple aspects: 1) Recoder
generates edits rather than modified code, allowing efficient representation of
small edits; 2) Recoder is syntax-guided, with the novel provider/decider
architecture to ensure the syntactic correctness of the patched program and
accurate generation; 3) Recoder generates placeholders that could be
instantiated as project-specific identifiers later.
  We conduct experiments to evaluate Recoder on 395 bugs from Defects4J v1.2
and 420 additional bugs from Defects4J v2.0. Our results show that Recoder
repairs 53 bugs on Defects4J v1.2, which achieves 21.4% improvement over the
previous state-of-the-art approach for single-hunk bugs (TBar). Importantly, to
our knowledge, Recoder is the first DL-based APR approach that has outperformed
the traditional APR approaches on this dataset. Furthermore, Recoder also
repairs 19 bugs on the additional bugs from Defects4J v2.0, which is 137.5%
more than TBar (8 bugs) and 850% more than SimFix (2 bugs). This result
suggests that Recoder has better generalizability than existing APR approaches.

for Bidirectional Encoder representation from Image Transformers. Following
BERT developed in the natural language processing area, we propose a masked
image modeling task to pretrain vision Transformers. Specifically, each image
has two views in our pre-training, i.e, image patches (such as 16x16 pixels),
and visual tokens (i.e., discrete tokens). We first ""tokenize"" the original
image into visual tokens. Then we randomly mask some image patches and fed them
into the backbone Transformer. The pre-training objective is to recover the
original visual tokens based on the corrupted image patches. After pre-training
BEiT, we directly fine-tune the model parameters on downstream tasks by
appending task layers upon the pretrained encoder. Experimental results on
image classification and semantic segmentation show that our model achieves
competitive results with previous pre-training methods. For example, base-size
BEiT achieves 83.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, significantly outperforming
from-scratch DeiT training (81.8%) with the same setup. Moreover, large-size

Our dataset features realistic simulations of a wide range of physical
phenomena, including rigid and soft-body collisions, stable multi-object

comprehensive challenge than previous benchmarks. We used Physion to benchmark
a suite of models varying in their architecture, learning objective,

measurements of human prediction behavior on the same set of scenarios,
allowing us to directly evaluate how well any model could approximate human
behavior. We found that vision algorithms that learn object-centric

short of human performance. On the other hand, graph neural networks with
direct access to physical state information both perform substantially better

of the presence or absence of protoplanetary disks inferred from infrared
photometry, supporting the solar-type model of PMS flaring magnetic loops with
both footpoints anchored in the stellar surface. Second, most PMS super-flares
resemble solar long duration events (LDEs) that are associated with coronal
mass ejections. Slow rise PMS super-flares are an interesting exception. Third,
strong correlations of super-flare peak emission measure and plasma temperature
with the stellar mass are similar to established correlations for the PMS X-ray

geometry is linked to stellar mass; more massive stars appear to have thicker
flaring loops. Finally, the slope of a long-standing relationship between the
X-ray luminosity and magnetic flux of various solar-stellar magnetic elements

in this study multi-script handwritten digit recognition using multi-task
learning will be investigated. As a specific case of demonstrating the solution
to the problem, Amharic handwritten character recognition will also be
experimented. The handwritten digits of three scripts including Latin, Arabic
and Kannada are studied to show that multi-task models with reformulation of
the individual tasks have shown promising results. In this study a novel way of
using the individual tasks predictions was proposed to help classification
performance and regularize the different loss for the purpose of the main task.
This finding has outperformed the baseline and the conventional multi-task
learning models. More importantly, it avoided the need for weighting the
different losses of the tasks, which is one of the challenges in multi-task
learning.

semantic segmentation of salt bodies, are among the most challenging
geophysicist tasks. Thus, identifying large salt bodies is notoriously tricky
and is crucial for identifying hydrocarbon reservoirs and drill path planning.
This work proposes a Data Augmentation method based on training two generative
models to augment the number of samples in a seismic image dataset for the
semantic segmentation of salt bodies. Our method uses deep learning models to
generate pairs of seismic image patches and their respective salt masks for the
Data Augmentation. The first model is a Variational Autoencoder and is
responsible for generating patches of salt body masks. The second is a
Conditional Normalizing Flow model, which receives the generated masks as
inputs and generates the associated seismic image patches. We evaluate the
proposed method by comparing the performance of ten distinct state-of-the-art
models for semantic segmentation, trained with and without the generated
augmentations, in a dataset from two synthetic seismic images. The proposed
methodology yields an average improvement of 8.57% in the IoU metric across all
compared models. The best result is achieved by a DeeplabV3+ model variant,
which presents an IoU score of 95.17% when trained with our augmentations.
Additionally, our proposal outperformed six selected data augmentation methods,
and the most significant improvement in the comparison, of 9.77%, is achieved
by composing our DA with augmentations from an elastic transformation. At last,
we show that the proposed method is adaptable for a larger context size by
achieving results comparable to the obtained on the smaller context size.

is followed by a stage II, conducted in a new yet relevant patient population,

exchangeable or nonexchangeable. Under the assumption of exchangeability, a

superradiant instabilities, or via accretion if they form some component of the
dark matter. It has been suggested that their presence may lead to a
distinctive dephasing of the gravitational wave signal when a small compact
object spirals into a larger black hole. Motivated by this, we study
numerically the dynamical friction force on a black hole moving at relativistic
velocities in a background scalar field with an asymptotically homogeneous
energy density. We show that the relativistic scaling is analogous to that
found for supersonic collisional fluids, assuming an approximate expression for
the pressure correction which depends on the velocity and scalar mass. While we
focus on a complex scalar field, our results confirm the expectation that real
scalars would exert a force which oscillates between positive and negative
values in time with a frequency set by the scalar mass. The complex field
describes the time averaged value of this force, but in a real scalar the rapid
force oscillations could in principle leave an imprint on the trajectory. The
approximation we obtain can be used to inform estimates of dephasing in the
final stages of an extreme mass ratio inspiral.

using a light sheet fluorescence microscopy - a recently developed technique
for whole-brain imaging. Most existing statistical methods solve this problem
by partitioning the brain regions into two classes: significantly and
non-significantly activated. However, for the brain imaging problem at the
center of our study, such binary grouping may provide overly simplistic
discoveries by filtering out weak but important signals, that are typically
adulterated by the noise present in the data. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a new Bayesian approach that allows classifying the brain regions
into several tiers with varying degrees of relevance. Our approach is based on
a combination of shrinkage priors - widely used in regression and multiple
hypothesis testing problems - and mixture models - commonly used in model-based
clustering. In contrast to the existing regularizing prior distributions, which
use either the spike-and-slab prior or continuous scale mixtures, our class of
priors is based on a discrete mixture of continuous scale mixtures and devises
a cluster-shrinkage version of the Horseshoe prior. As a result, our approach
provides a more general setting for Bayesian sparse estimation, drastically
reduces the number of shrinkage parameters needed, and creates a framework for
sharing information across units of interest. We show that this approach leads
to more biologically meaningful and interpretable results in our brain imaging
problem, since it allows the discrimination between active and inactive
regions, while at the same time ranking the discoveries into clusters
representing tiers of similar importance.

types of bulges - classical bulges and boxy/peanut pseudobulges. Our N-body
simulations comprise of two disk galaxies of mass ratios 10:1 and 5:1, where
the disks of the galaxies lie in their orbital plane and the pericenter
distance is varied. We performed photometric and kinematic bulge-disk
decomposition at regular time steps and traced the evolution of the disk size,
spiral structure, bulge sersic index, bulge mass, and bulge angular momentum.
Our results show that the main effect on the disks is disk thickening, which is
seen as the increase in the ratio of disk scale height to scale radius. The
strength of the spiral structure A2/A0 shows small oscillations about the mean
time-varying amplitude in the pseudobulge host galaxies. The flyby has no
significant effect on non-rotating classical bulge, which shows that these
bulges are extremely stable in galaxy interactions. However, the pseudobulges
become dynamically hotter in flybys indicating that flybys may play an
important role in accelerating the rate of secular evolution in disk galaxies.
This effect on pseudobulges is a result of their rotating nature as part of the
bar. Also, flybys do not affect the time and strength of bar buckling.

clusters can be sensitive probes of the properties of dark matter. We run 30
cosmological zoom-in simulations with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), with
a velocity-dependent cross-section, to study the properties of subhalos within
cluster-mass hosts. We find that the abundance of subhalos that survive in the
SIDM simulations are suppressed relative to their cold dark matter (CDM)
counterparts. Once the population of disrupted subhalos -- which may host
orphan galaxies -- are taken into account, satellite galaxy populations in CDM
and SIDM models can be reconciled. However, even in this case, the inner
structure of subhalos are significantly different in the two dark matter
models. We study the feasibility of using the weak lensing signal from the
subhalo density profiles to distinguish between the cold and self-interacting
dark matter while accounting for the potential contribution of orphan galaxies.
We find that the effects of self-interactions on the density profile of
subhalos can appear degenerate with subhalo disruption in CDM, when orphans are
accounted for. With current error bars from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam
Strategic Program, we find that subhalos in the outskirts of clusters (where
disruption is less prevalent) can be used to constrain dark matter physics. In
the future, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time will
give precise measurements of the weak lensing profile and can be used to

A-\varepsilon^{-2}( A A^{\mathrm{T}}A-
A)~~\text{with}~~A:\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^m\to\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}.$$ We
show that the sharp interface system is a two-phases flow system: the interface
evolves according to the motion by mean curvature; in the two bulk phase
regions, the solution obeys the heat flow of harmonic maps with values in
$O^+(n)$ and $O^-(n)$ (represent the sets of $n\times n$ orthogonal matrices
with determinant $+1$ and $-1$ respectively); on the interface, the phase
matrices in two sides satisfy a novel mixed boundary condition.
  The above result provides a solution to the Keller-Rubinstein-Sternberg's
(conjecture) problem in this $O(n)$ setting. Our proof relies on two key
ingredients. First, in order to construct the approximate solution by matched
asymptotic expansions as the standard approach does not seem to work, we
introduce the notion of quasi-minimal connecting orbits. They satisfy the usual
leading order equations up to some small higher order terms. In addition, the
linearized systems around these quasi-minimal orbits needs to be solvable up to
some good remainders. These flexibilities are needed for the possible
""degenerations"" or higher dimensional kernels for the linearized operators due
to intriguing boundary conditions at the sharp interface. The second key point
is to establish a spectral uniform lower bound estimate for the linearized
operator around approximate solutions. To this end, we introduce additional
decompositions to reduce the problem into the coercive estimates of several
linearized operators for scalar functions and some singular product estimates
which is accomplished by exploring special cancellation structures between
eigenfunctions of these linearized operators.

last decade for solving narrow AI problems in domains such as healthcare,
transportation, and defense. As ANNs become more ubiquitous, it is imperative
to understand their associated safety, security, and privacy vulnerabilities.
Recently, it has been shown that ANNs are susceptible to a number of
adversarial evasion attacks--inputs that cause the ANN to make high-confidence
misclassifications despite being almost indistinguishable from the data used to
train and test the network. This work explores to what degree finding these
examples maybe aided by using side-channel information, specifically switching
power consumption, of hardware implementations of ANNs. A black-box threat
scenario is assumed, where an attacker has access to the ANN hardware's input,
outputs, and topology, but the trained model parameters are unknown. Then, a
surrogate model is trained to have similar functional (i.e. input-output
mapping) and switching power characteristics as the oracle (black-box) model.
Our results indicate that the inclusion of power consumption data increases the
fidelity of the model extraction by up to 30 percent based on a mean square
error comparison of the oracle and surrogate weights. However, transferability
of adversarial examples from the surrogate to the oracle model was not
significantly affected.

can hardly truly accelerate inference, either due to the poor hardware
compatibility of the unstructured sparsity or due to the low sparse rate of the
structurally pruned network. Aiming at reducing both storage and computation,
as well as preserving the original task performance, we propose a generalized
weight unification framework at a hardware compatible micro-structured level to
achieve high amount of compression and acceleration. Weight coefficients of a
selected micro-structured block are unified to reduce the storage and
computation of the block without changing the neuron connections, which turns
to a micro-structured pruning special case when all unified coefficients are
set to zero, where neuron connections (hence storage and computation) are
completely removed. In addition, we developed an effective training framework
based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), which converts
our complex constrained optimization into separately solvable subproblems.
Through iteratively optimizing the subproblems, the desired micro-structure can
be ensured with high compression ratio and low performance degradation. We
extensively evaluated our method using a variety of benchmark models and

use of statistical models that predict the spatial-temporal likelihood of

stationing which allocates first responders across the spatial area in order to
reduce overall response time. Traditional methods that simply aggregate past
incidents over space and time fail to make useful short-term predictions when
the spatial region is large and focused on fine-grained spatial entities like
interstate highway networks. This is partially due to the sparsity of incidents
with respect to the area in consideration. Further, accidents are affected by
several covariates, and collecting, cleaning, and managing multiple streams of
data from various sources is challenging for large spatial areas. In this
paper, we highlight how this problem is being solved for the state of
Tennessee, a state in the USA with a total area of over 100,000 sq. km. Our
pipeline, based on a combination of synthetic resampling, non-spatial
clustering, and learning from data can efficiently forecast the spatial and
temporal dynamics of accident occurrence, even under sparse conditions. In the
paper, we describe our pipeline that uses data related to roadway geometry,
weather, historical accidents, and real-time traffic congestion to aid accident
forecasting. To understand how our forecasting model can affect allocation and
dispatch, we improve upon a classical resource allocation approach.
Experimental results show that our approach can significantly reduce response

expressions to describe the response of the electric current quadratic in the
applied electric field. We compare two different formalisms, namely the
standard Keldysh nonequilibrium formalism and the Moyal-Keldysh formalism, to
derive the nonlinear conductivities of UMR and NLHE. We find that both
formalisms lead to identical numerical results when applied to the
ferromagnetic Rashba model. The UMR and the NLHE nonlinear conductivities tend
to be comparable in magnitude according to our calculations. Additionally,
their dependencies on the Rashba parameter and on the quasiparticle broadening
are similar. The nonlinear zero-frequency response considered here is several
orders of magnitude higher than the one at optical frequencies that describes
the photocurrent generation in the ferromagnetic Rashba model. Additionally, we
compare our Keldysh nonequilibrium expression in the independent-particle
approximation to literature expressions of the UMR that have been obtained
within the constant relaxation time approximation of the Boltzmann formalism.
We find that both formalisms converge to the same analytical formula in the
limit of infinite relaxation time. However, remarkably, we find that the
Boltzmann result does not correspond to the intraband term of the Keldysh
expression. Instead, the Boltzmann result corresponds to the sum of the
intraband term and an interband term that can be brought into the form of an
effective intraband term due to the f-sum rule.

stages: initialization with a corpus of normal speech and finetuning on a
mixture of dysarthric and normal speech. By introducing the intelligibility

solutions pose both modeling challenges, since the physical interpretation of
simulation results is not possible, and computational challenges, since such
properties may be required to advance the scheme. We, therefore, consider the
problem of computing solutions that preserve these structural solution
properties, which we enforce as additional constraints on the solution. We
consider in particular the class of convex constraints, which includes
positivity and monotonicity. By embedding such constraints as a postprocessing
convex optimization procedure, we can compute solutions that satisfy general
types of convex constraints. For certain types of constraints (including
positivity and monotonicity), the optimization is a filter, i.e., a
norm-decreasing operation. We provide a variety of tests on one-dimensional

reduces sequencing costs by profiling reduced gene sets that capture biological
information with a minimal number of genes. Here, we introduce an active
learning method (ActiveSVM) that identifies minimal but highly-informative gene
sets that enable the identification of cell-types, physiological states, and
genetic perturbations in single-cell data using a small number of genes. Our
active feature selection procedure generates minimal gene sets from single-cell
data through an iterative cell-type classification task where misclassified
cells are examined at each round of analysis to identify maximally informative
genes through an `active' support vector machine (ActiveSVM) classifier. By
focusing computational resources on misclassified cells, ActiveSVM scales to
analyze data sets with over a million single cells. We demonstrate that
ActiveSVM feature selection identifies gene sets that enable ~90% cell-type
classification accuracy across a variety of data sets including cell atlas and
disease characterization data sets. The method generalizes to reveal genes that
respond to genetic perturbations and to identify region specific gene
expression patterns in spatial transcriptomics data. The discovery of small but
highly informative gene sets should enable substantial reductions in the number
of measurements necessary for application of single-cell mRNA-seq to clinical

To compute the gradients required to update parameters, backpropagation blocks
computations until the forward and backward passes are completed. For temporal

creates a coupling between consecutive layers, which limits model parallelism
and increases memory consumption. In this paper, we build upon Sideways, which
avoids blocking by propagating approximate gradients forward in time, and we
propose mechanisms for temporal integration of information based on different
variants of skip connections. We also show how to decouple computation and
delegate individual neural modules to different devices, allowing distributed
and parallel training. The proposed Skip-Sideways achieves low latency
training, model parallelism, and, importantly, is capable of extracting
temporal features, leading to more stable training and improved performance on
real-world action recognition video datasets such as HMDB51, UCF101, and the
large-scale Kinetics-600. Finally, we also show that models trained with

dependence of the spin susceptibility closely maps the phase diagram of the

into the topological superconducting state by minimizing its free energy.
Self-tuned topological transitions are accompanied by sharp peaks in the spin
susceptibility, which can therefore be use as measurable fingerprints for
detecting the topological superconducting state. Away from the peaks, the
amplitude of the spin susceptibility can provide qualitative information about
the relative size of the topological gap. The signatures in the spin
susceptibility are robust, even in junctions with narrow superconducting leads,
where critical current minima may no longer serve as an indication of
topological phase transitions. Numerical simulations are complemented with
simplified analytical models capable of capturing the main features predicted

particularly relevant for future experiments on realization and detection of

This framework yields a new understanding of InfoNCE, a variational lower bound

approximates SSL-HSIC (with a slightly different regularizer). Our approach
also gives us insight into BYOL, a negative-free SSL method, since SSL-HSIC
similarly learns local neighborhoods of samples. SSL-HSIC allows us to directly
optimize statistical dependence in time linear in the batch size, without
restrictive data assumptions or indirect mutual information estimators. Trained

with a serial distributed model predictive control (DMPC) strategy with
guaranteed local and string stability. In the DMPC strategy, each following
truck acquires the future predicted state information of its predecessor
through vehicle connectivity and then applies local optimal control to maintain
constant spacing. Simulation studies are conducted to investigate the fuel

6097540197980557440, a new deeply-eclipsing hot subdwarf B (sdB) + M dwarf (dM)
binary. We discovered this object during the course of the Eclipsing Reflection
Effect Binaries from Optical Surveys (EREBOS) project, which aims to find new
eclipsing sdB+dM binaries (HW Vir systems) and increase the small sample of
studied systems. In addition to the primary eclipse, which is in excess of
$\sim$5 magnitudes in the optical, the light curve also shows features typical
for other HW Vir binaries such as a secondary eclipse and strong reflection
effect from the irradiated, cool companion. The orbital period is 0.127037 d
($\sim$3 hr), falling right at the peak of the orbital period distribution of
known HW Vir systems. Analysis of our time-series spectroscopy yields a radial
velocity semi-amplitude of $K_{\rm sdB}=100.0\pm2.0\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$, which
is amongst the fastest line-of-sight velocities found to date for an HW Vir
binary. State-of-the-art atmospheric models that account for deviations from
local thermodynamic equilibrium are used to determine the atmospheric
parameters of the sdB. Although we cannot claim a unique light curve modeling
solution, the best-fitting model has an sdB mass of $M_{\rm sdB} =
0.47\pm0.03\,M_{\odot}$ and a companion mass of $M_{\rm dM} =
0.18\pm0.01\,M_{\odot}$. The radius of the companion appears to be inflated
relative to theoretical mass-radius relationships, consistent with other known
HW Vir binaries. Additionally, the M dwarf is one of the most massive found to
date amongst this type of binary.

convergence. Such problems have their origins in an interplay between the
behaviour of standard experimental cuts at small transverse momenta ($p_t$) and
logarithmic perturbative contributions. We illustrate how this interplay leads
to a factorially divergent structure in the perturbative series that sets in
already from the first orders. We propose simple modifications of fiducial cuts
to eliminate their key incriminating characteristic, a linear dependence of the
acceptance on the Higgs or $Z$-boson $p_t$, replacing it with quadratic

the Higgs $p_t$ at low $p_t$, with a variety of consequent advantages.

supermassive black holes (SMBHs $>10^9 \rm M_{\odot}$) whose origin is still
difficult to explain. Their progenitors may have formed as remnants of massive,
metal free stars (light seeds), via stellar collisions (medium-weight seeds)
and/or massive gas clouds direct collapse (heavy seeds). In this work we
investigate for the first time the relative role of these three seed
populations in the formation of $z>6$ SMBHs within an Eddington-limited gas
accretion scenario. To this aim, we implement in our semi-analytical
data-constrained model a statistical description of the spatial fluctuations of
Lyman-Werner (LW) photo-dissociating radiation and of metal/dust enrichment.
This allows us to set the physical conditions for BH seeds formation, exploring
their relative birth rate in a highly biased region of the Universe at $z>6$.
We find that the inclusion of medium-weight seeds does not qualitatively change
the growth history of the first SMBHs: although less massive seeds ($<10^3 \rm
M_\odot$) form at a higher rate, the mass growth of a $\sim 10^9 \rm M_\odot$
SMBH at $z<15$ is driven by efficient gas accretion (at a sub-Eddington rate)
onto its heavy progenitors ($10^5 \rm M_\odot$). This conclusion holds
independently of the critical level of LW radiation and even when medium-weight
seeds are allowed to form in higher metallicity galaxies, via the so-called
super-competitive accretion scenario. Our study suggests that the genealogy of
$z \sim 6$ SMBHs is characterized by a rich variety of BH progenitors, which
represent only a small fraction ($< 10 - 20\%$) of all the BHs that seed
galaxies at $z > 15$.

in the 10-15 pc range with our conservative magnification limits. The sizes and
luminosities are similar to those of single star cluster complexes like 30
Doradus in the lower-redshift universe and -- in a few cases -- super star

we rule out (with some caveats) proto-globular cluster formation scenarios

find no evidence for star formation along the outflow paths. For eight objects,
the outflow paths are consistent with the orientation of the jets. Yet, given

$\lambda\lambda 2796,2803$ absorption is detected across the sample.
Blue-shifted absorption and/or redshifted emission of Mg II is found in the two

sources (median age less than 0.4 Gyr) than the two older ones, perhaps
suggesting a decline in nuclear activity as quenching proceeds. Despite
high-velocity ($v\approx1500$ km s$^{-1}$) galactic-scale outflows seen in the
most recently quenched galaxies, warm gas is still present to some extent long
after quenching. Altogether our results indicate that star formation quenching
at high redshift must have been a rapid process (< 1 Gyr) that does not
synchronize with bulge formation or complete gas removal. Substantial bulge
growth is required if they are to evolve into the metal-rich cores of

the black hole (BH) accretion is expected to take place in highly obscured
conditions. Thus, obscured AGN are difficult to identify in optical or X-ray
bands, but shine bright in the IR. Moreover, X-ray background (XRB) synthesis
models predict that a large fraction of the yet-unresolved XRB is due to the
most obscured (Compton thick, CT) of these AGN. In this work, we investigate
the synergies between putative IR missions (using SPICA, proposed for ESA/M5
but withdrawn in October 2020, and Origins Space Telescope, OST, as
`templates') and the X-ray mission Athena, which should fly in early 2030s, in
detecting and characterizing AGN, with a particular focus on the most obscured
ones. Using an XRB synthesis model, we estimated the number of AGN and the
number of those which will be detected in the X-rays. For each AGN we
associated an optical-to-FIR SED from observed AGN with both X-ray data and SED
decomposition, and used these SEDs to check if the AGN will be detected by
SPICA-like or OST at IR wavelengths. We expect that, with the deepest Athena
and SPICA-like (or OST) surveys, we will be able to detect in the IR more than
$90\,\%$ of all the AGN (down to L$_{2-10\text{keV}} \sim 10^{42}\,$erg/s and
up to $z \sim 10$) predicted by XRB synthesis modeling, and we will detect at
least half of them in the X-rays. Athena will be extremely powerful in
detecting and discerning moderate- and high-luminosity AGN. We find that the
most obscured and elusive CT-AGN will be exquisitely sampled by SPICA-like
mission or OST and that Athena will allow a fine characterization of the
most-luminous ones. This will provide a significant step forward in the process
of placing stronger constraints on the yet-unresolved XRB and investigating the
BH accretion rate evolution up to very high redshift ($z \ge 4$).

recombination to structure formation across the entire past light cone. In this
work, we present forecasts for the joint analysis of $Euclid$ and CMB data on
the cosmological parameters of the standard cosmological model and some of its
extensions. This work expands and complements the recently published forecasts
based on $Euclid$-specific probes, namely galaxy clustering, weak lensing, and
their cross-correlation. With some assumptions on the specifications of current
and future CMB experiments, the predicted constraints are obtained from both a
standard Fisher formalism and a posterior-fitting approach based on actual CMB
data. Compared to a $Euclid$-only analysis, the addition of CMB data leads to a
substantial impact on constraints for all cosmological parameters of the
standard $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter model, with improvements reaching up to a
factor of ten. For the parameters of extended models, which include a
redshift-dependent dark energy equation of state, non-zero curvature, and a
phenomenological modification of gravity, improvements can be of the order of
two to three, reaching higher than ten in some cases. The results highlight the
crucial importance for cosmological constraints of the combination and
cross-correlation of $Euclid$ probes with CMB data.

dark current, amplifier light, and spurious charge. We measure a dark current,
which depends on exposure, of (5.89+-0.77)x10^-4 e-/pix/day, and an
unprecedentedly low spurious charge contribution of (1.52+-0.07)x10^-4 e-/pix,
which is exposure-independent. In addition, we provide a technique to study
events produced by light emitted from the amplifier, which allows the
detector's operation to be optimized to minimize this effect to a level below
the dark-current contribution. Our accurate characterization of the
single-electron events allows one to greatly extend the sensitivity of
experiments searching for dark matter or coherent neutrino scattering.
Moreover, an accurate understanding of the origin of single-electron events is
critical to further progress in ongoing R&D efforts of Skipper and conventional

The presence of exomoons orbiting free-floating planets has been theoretically
predicted by several models. Under specific conditions, these moons are able to
retain an atmosphere capable of ensuring the long-term thermal stability of
liquid water on their surface. We model this environment with a one-dimensional
radiative-convective code coupled to a gas-phase chemical network including
cosmic rays and ion-neutral reactions. We find that, under specific conditions
and assuming stable orbital parameters over time, liquid water can be formed on
the surface of the exomoon. The final amount of water for an Earth-mass
exomonoon is smaller than the amount of water in Earth oceans, but enough to
host the potential development of primordial life. The chemical equilibrium
time-scale is controlled by cosmic rays, the main ionization driver in our
model of the exomoon atmosphere.

show that solutions to the Einstein (Maxwell) equations are able to trigger the

(re-)accelerated to high energies in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. However,
estimates of the shocks' strength yield different results when measured with
radio or X-ray observations. In general, Mach numbers obtained from radio
observations are larger than the corresponding X-ray measurements. In this
work, we investigate this Mach number discrepancy. For this purpose, we used
the cosmological code ENZO to simulate a sample of galaxy clusters that host
bright radio relics. For each relic, we computed the radio Mach number from the
integrated radio spectrum and the X-ray Mach number from the X-ray surface
brightness and temperature jumps. Our analysis suggests that the differences in
the Mach number estimates follow from the way in which different observables
are related to different parts of the underlying Mach number distribution:
radio observations are more sensistive to the high Mach numbers present only in
a small fraction of a shock's surface, while X-ray measurements reflect the
average of the Mach number distribution. Moreover, X-ray measurements are very
sensitive to the relic's orientation. If the same relic is observed from
different sides, the measured X-ray Mach number varies significantly. On the
other hand, the radio measurements are more robust, as they are unaffected by
the relic's orientation.

able to learn from speech data that vary in ways not explained by the

training data is to provide acoustic information as an additional learning
signal. When generating speech, modifying this acoustic information enables
multiple distinct renditions of a text to be produced.
  Since much of the unexplained variation is in the prosody, we propose a model
that generates speech explicitly conditioned on the three primary acoustic
correlates of prosody: $F_{0}$, energy and duration. The model is flexible
about how the values of these features are specified: they can be externally
provided, or predicted from text, or predicted then subsequently modified.
  Compared to a model that employs a variational auto-encoder to learn
unsupervised latent features, our model provides more interpretable,
temporally-precise, and disentangled control. When automatically predicting the
acoustic features from text, it generates speech that is more natural than that
from a Tacotron 2 model with reference encoder. Subsequent human-in-the-loop

increase naturalness.

the excitons' unique coupling to spin and orbital degrees of freedom. The
non-equilibrium driving of such dressed quasiparticles offers a promising
platform for realizing unconventional many-body phenomena and phases beyond
thermodynamic equilibrium. Here, we achieve this in the van der Waals
correlated insulator NiPS$_3$ by photoexciting its newly discovered
spin-orbit-entangled excitons that arise from Zhang-Rice states. By monitoring
the time evolution of the terahertz conductivity, we observe the coexistence of
itinerant carriers produced by exciton dissociation and the long-wavelength
antiferromagnetic magnon that coherently precesses in time. These results
demonstrate the emergence of a transient metallic state that preserves
long-range antiferromagnetism, a phase that cannot be reached by simply tuning

estimate bacterial composition based on the sequencing read counts. Various
transformations are then applied to such compositional data for downstream
statistical analysis, among which the centered log-ratio (clr) transformation
is most commonly used.
  Due to limited sequencing depth and DNA dropouts, many rare bacterial taxa
might not be captured in the final sequencing reads, which results in many zero
counts. Naive composition estimation using count normalization leads to many
zero proportions, which makes clr transformation infeasible. This paper
proposes a multi-sample approach to estimation of the clr matrix directly in
order to borrow information across samples and across species. Empirical
results from real datasets suggest that the clr matrix over multiple samples is
approximately low rank, which motivates a regularized maximum likelihood
estimation with a nuclear norm penalty. An efficient optimization algorithm
using the generalized accelerated proximal gradient is developed. Theoretical
upper bounds of the estimation errors and of its corresponding singular
subspace errors are established. Simulation studies demonstrate that the
proposed estimator outperforms the naive estimators. The method is analyzed on

financial institutions. The most efficient models use deep-learning
architectures similar to those in the NLP community, posing a challenge due to
their tremendous number of parameters and limited robustness. In particular,
deep-learning models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks: a little change in
the input harms the model's output.
  In this work, we examine adversarial attacks on transaction records data and
defences from these attacks. The transaction records data have a different
structure than the canonical NLP or time series data, as neighbouring records
are less connected than words in sentences, and each record consists of both
discrete merchant code and continuous transaction amount. We consider a
black-box attack scenario, where the attack doesn't know the true decision
model, and pay special attention to adding transaction tokens to the end of a
sequence. These limitations provide more realistic scenario, previously
unexplored in NLP world.
  The proposed adversarial attacks and the respective defences demonstrate
remarkable performance using relevant datasets from the financial industry. Our
results show that a couple of generated transactions are sufficient to fool a
deep-learning model. Further, we improve model robustness via adversarial
training or separate adversarial examples detection. This work shows that
embedding protection from adversarial attacks improves model robustness,
allowing a wider adoption of deep models for transaction records in banking and

superdiffusion of turbulent magnetic fields, CRs with large pitch angles that
undergo mirror reflection, i.e., bouncing CRs, are not trapped between magnetic
mirrors, but move diffusively along the turbulent magnetic field, leading to a
new type of parallel diffusion, i.e., mirror diffusion. This mirror diffusion
is in general slower than the diffusion of non-bouncing CRs with small pitch
angles that undergo gyroresonant scattering. The critical pitch angle at the
balance between magnetic mirroring and pitch-angle scattering is important for
determining the diffusion coefficients of both bouncing and non-bouncing CRs

diffusion coefficients, depending on the properties of MHD turbulence.

Ultimate flood impact data, such as flood inundation maps and insurance claims,
becomes available only weeks and months after the floods have receded. Crisis
response managers, however, need near-real-time data to prioritize emergency
response. This time lag creates a need for rapid flood impact assessment. Some
recent studies have shown promising results for using human activity
fluctuations as indicators of flood impacts. Existing studies, however, used
mainly a single community-scale activity feature for the estimation of flood
impacts and have not investigated their temporal importance for indicating
flood impacts. Hence, in this study, we examined the importance of
heterogeneous human activity features in different flood event stages. Using
four community-scale big data categories we derived ten features related to the
variations in human activity and evaluated their temporal importance for rapid
assessment of flood impacts. Using multiple random forest models, we examined
the temporal importance of each feature in indicating the extent of flood
impacts in the context of the 2017 Hurricane Harvey in Harris County, Texas.
Our findings reveal that 1) fluctuations in human activity index and percentage
of congested roads are the most important indicators for rapid flood impact
assessment during response and recovery stages; 2) variations in credit card
transactions assumed a middle ranking; and 3) patterns of geolocated social
media posts (Twitter) were of low importance across flood stages. The results
of this research could rapidly forge a multi-tool enabling crisis managers to
identify hotspots with severe flood impacts at various stages then to plan and
prioritize effective response strategies.

virtual tests the employed sensor models have to be validated. For this reason,
it is necessary to quantify the discrepancy between simulation and reality in
order to determine whether a certain fidelity is sufficient for a desired

simulation-to-reality gap of radar perception for autonomous driving. We
address this problem by introducing a multi-layered evaluation approach, which
consists of a combination of an explicit and an implicit sensor model
evaluation. The former directly evaluates the realism of the synthetically

diagonalization that some of these states remain strictly localized within the

match the energy differences between these states exactly. This has important
implications for open systems, where the strongly interacting leads are often

actively studied. Although the theory has been applied successfully in models
and in experiments for many complex systems such as for tipping in climate
systems, there are ongoing debates, when warning signs can be extracted from
data. In this work, we shed light on this debate by considering different types
of underlying noise. Thereby, we significantly advance the general theory of
warning signs for nonlinear stochastic dynamics. A key scenario deals with
stochastic systems approaching a bifurcation point dynamically upon slow
parameter variation. The stochastic fluctuations are generically able to probe
the dynamics near a deterministic attractor to reveal critical slowing down.
Using scaling laws near bifurcations, one can then anticipate the distance to a
bifurcation. Previous warning signs results assume that the noise is Markovian,
most often even white. Here, we study warning signs for non-Markovian systems
including coloured noise and $\alpha$-regular Volterra processes (of which
fractional Brownian motion and the Rosenblatt process are special cases). We
prove that early warning scaling laws can disappear completely or drastically
change their exponent based upon the parameters controlling the noise process.
This provides a clear explanation, why applying standard warning signs results
to reduced models of complex systems may not agree with data-driven studies. We
demonstrate our results numerically in the context of a box model of the

in the Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) model, which achieves minimax optimal
regret as long as certain properties are ensured. The key of our analysis is a
new technique called implicit finite-horizon approximation, which approximates
the SSP model by a finite-horizon counterpart only in the analysis without
explicit implementation. Using this template, we develop two new algorithms:
the first one is model-free (the first in the literature to our knowledge) and
minimax optimal under strictly positive costs; the second one is model-based
and minimax optimal even with zero-cost state-action pairs, matching the best
existing result from [Tarbouriech et al., 2021b]. Importantly, both algorithms
admit highly sparse updates, making them computationally more efficient than
all existing algorithms. Moreover, both can be made completely parameter-free.

results of INS experiments on both transition-metal and rare-earth subsystems
for four selected compounds (YbFeO$_3$, TmFeO$_3$, YFeO$_3$, YbAlO$_3$) are
presented. We show that the spectrum of magnetic excitations consists of two
types of collective modes that are well separated in energy: gapped magnons
with a typical bandwidth of $<$70 meV, associated with the
antiferromagnetically (AFM) ordered transition-metal subsystem, and AFM
fluctuations of $<$5 meV within the rare-earth subsystem, with no hybridization
of those modes. We discuss the high-energy conventional magnon excitations of
the 3$d$ subsystem only briefly, and focus in more detail on the spectacular
dynamics of the rare-earth sublattice in these materials. We observe that the
nature of the ground state and the low-energy excitation strongly depends on
the identity of the rare-earth ion. In the case of non-Kramers ions, the
low-symmetry crystal field completely eliminates the degeneracy of the
multiplet state, creating a rich magnetic field-temperature phase diagram. In
the case of Kramers ions, the resulting ground state is at least a doublet,
which can be viewed as an effective quantum spin-1/2. Equally important is the
fact that in Yb-based materials the nearest-neighbor exchange interaction
dominates in one direction, despite the three-dimensional nature of the
orthoperovskite crystal structure. The observation of a fractional spinon
continuum and quantum criticality in YbAlO$_3$ demonstrates that Kramers
rare-earth based magnets can provide realizations of various aspects of quantum
low-dimensional physics.

solar cycles, and sacrificing resolution in favour of lower uncertainties, we
show that there are significant changes in the solar convection zone, and
perhaps even below it. Using MDI data, we find a relative squared sound-speed
difference of $(2.56\pm 0.71)\times 10^{-5}$ at the convection-zone base

The squared sound-speed difference for the maximum of Cycle~24 obtained with
HMI data is $(1.95\pm 0.69)\times 10^{-5}$. GONG data support these results. We
also find that the sound speed in the solar convection zone decreases compared
to the sound speed below it as the Sun becomes more active. We find evidence of
changes in the radial derivative of the sound-speed difference between the
solar minimum and other epochs at the base of the convection zone implying
possible small changes in the position of the convection-zone base, however,
the results are too noisy to make any definitive estimates of the change.

The former are mostly
due to severe congenital malformations of one or a small number of specific
organs. On the contrary, old age deaths are largely the outcome of a long
process of deterioration which starts in the 20s and affects almost all organs.
In terms of age-specific death rates, there is also a clear distinction: the
infant death rate falls off with age, whereas the adult and old age death rate
increases exponentially with age in conformity with Gompertz's law.
  Clearly, it would be satisfactory to explain the two phenomena as being two
variants within the same explanatory framework. In other words, a mechanism
providing a combined explanation for the two forms of mortality would be
welcome. This is the purpose of the present paper.
  We show here that the same biological effects can account for the two cases
provided there is a difference in their severity: death triggered by isolated
lethal anomalies in one case and widespread wear-out anomalies in the second.
We show that quite generally this mechanism leads indeed, respectively, to a
declining and an upgoing death rate. Moreover, this theoretical framework leads
to the conjecture that the severity of the death effects, whether in infancy or
old age, are higher for organisms which are comprised of a larger number of
organs. Finally, let us observe that the main focus of the paper is the drastic
difference of the age-specific death rates (i.e. decreasing versus increasing)
because this difference is found in many species, whereas the question of the
best fit (e.g. Gompertz versus Weibull) is rather specific to human mortality.

we propose the principle of attacking model space for solving bilevel attack

solved analytically and verified experimentally through a high-quality X-ray

reformulate the scenario sampling problem across ODDs and functionalities as a

Bayesian Hierarchical Model, which we use to infer information gained by
revealing performance in new scenarios. We propose the information gain as a
measure of scenario relevance and evaluation progress. Furthermore, we leverage
the submodularity, or diminishing returns, property of the information gain not
only to find a near-optimal scenario set, but also to propose a stopping
criterion for an AV performance evaluation campaign. We find that we only need
to explore about 7.5% of the scenario space to meet this criterion, a 23%
improvement over Latin Hypercube Sampling.

regularization strategy for the three-dimensional Calder\'on problem is
presented based on a suitable and explicit truncation of the scattering

is robust to small perturbations of the data. Numerical tests on simulated

on group representation theory. We observe that in the one-dimensional subspace

of the trivial representation. Besides being technical guidance in this type of

simulations to study the properties of isothermal galactic winds driven by
cosmic-rays (CRs) streaming at the Alfv\'en velocity. The simulations produce
time-dependent flows permeated by strong shocks; we identify a new linear
instability of sound waves that sources these shocks. The shocks substantially
modify the wind dynamics, invalidating previous steady state models: the CR
pressure $p_c$ has a staircase-like structure with $dp_c/dr \simeq 0$ in most
of the volume, and the time-averaged CR energetics are in many cases better
approximated by $p_c \propto \rho^{1/2}$, rather than the canonical $p_c
\propto \rho^{2/3}$. Accounting for this change in CR energetics, we
analytically derive new expressions for the mass-loss rate, momentum flux, wind
speed, and wind kinetic power in galactic winds driven by CR streaming. We show
that streaming CRs are ineffective at directly driving cold gas out of
galaxies, though CR-driven winds in hotter ISM phases may entrain cool gas. For
the same physical conditions, diffusive CR transport (Paper I) yields mass-loss
rates that are a few-100 times larger than streaming transport, and asymptotic
wind powers that are a factor of $\simeq 4$ larger. We discuss the implications
of our results for galactic wind theory and observations; strong shocks driven
by CR-streaming-induced instabilities produce gas with a wide range of
densities and temperatures, consistent with the multiphase nature of observed
winds. We also quantify the applicability of the isothermal gas approximation
for modeling streaming CRs and highlight the need for calculations with more

turbulent premixed flames is crucial towards the design and development of
hydrogen fuelled next-generation engines. Premixed hydrogen-air flames are
characterized by significantly higher laminar flame speed compared to other
conventional fuels. Furthermore, in the presence of turbulence, $S_d$ is
enhanced much beyond its corresponding unstretched, planar laminar value $S_L$.
In this study, the effect of high Karlovitz number ($Ka$) turbulence on
density-weighted flame displacement speed, $\widetilde{S_d}$, in a H$_2$-air
flame is investigated. Recently, it has been identified that flame-flame
interactions in regions of large negative curvature govern large deviations of
$\widetilde{S_d}$ from $S_L$, for moderately turbulent flames. An interaction
model for the same has also been proposed. In this work, we seek to test the
interaction model's applicability to intensely turbulent flames characterized
by large $Ka$. To that end, we investigate the local flame structures: thermal,
chemical structure, the effect of curvature, along the direction that is normal
to the chosen isothermal surfaces. Furthermore, relative contributions of the
transport and chemistry terms to $\widetilde{S_d}$ are also analyzed. It is
found that, unlike the moderately turbulent premixed flames, where enhanced
$\widetilde{S_d}$ is driven by interactions among complete flame structures,
$\widetilde{S_d}$ enhancement in high $Re_t$ and high $Ka$ flame is
predominantly governed by local interactions of the isotherms. It is found that
enhancement in $\widetilde{S_d}$ in regions of large negative curvature occurs
as a result of these interactions, evincing that the interaction model is
useful for high $Ka$ turbulent premixed flames as well.

be solved numerically. We reformulate the DRG in the language of differential
geometry, which allows us to apply it to numerical solutions of the background

systems with background parameter flows, and therefore, extend our results to
any order in perturbation theory. As an example, we apply this method to
calculate the soliton-like solutions of the Korteweg-de Vries equation deformed
by adding a small damping term. We numerically construct DRG solutions which
are valid on secular time scales, long after naive perturbation theory has

incentives sequentially revealed across time without a system dynamics model.
Due to its scaling to continuous spaces, we focus on policy search where one
iteratively improves a parameterized policy with stochastic policy gradient
(PG) updates. In tabular Markov Decision Problems (MDPs), under persistent
exploration and suitable parameterization, global optimality may be obtained.
By contrast, in continuous space, the non-convexity poses a pathological
challenge as evidenced by existing convergence results being mostly limited to
stationarity or arbitrary local extrema. To close this gap, we step towards
persistent exploration in continuous space through policy parameterizations
defined by distributions of heavier tails defined by tail-index parameter
alpha, which increases the likelihood of jumping in state space. Doing so
invalidates smoothness conditions of the score function common to PG. Thus, we
establish how the convergence rate to stationarity depends on the policy's tail
index alpha, a Holder continuity parameter, integrability conditions, and an
exploration tolerance parameter introduced here for the first time. Further, we
characterize the dependence of the set of local maxima on the tail index
through an exit and transition time analysis of a suitably defined Markov
chain, identifying that policies associated with Levy Processes of a heavier
tail converge to wider peaks. This phenomenon yields improved stability to
perturbations in supervised learning, which we corroborate also manifests in
improved performance of policy search, especially when myopic and farsighted
incentives are misaligned.

strategy as the query to our model, enabling one to invoke a single model to
predict agent behavior in many ways, such as potentially conditioned on the
goal or full future trajectory of the autonomous vehicle or the behavior of
other agents in the environment. Our model architecture employs attention to
combine features across road elements, agent interactions, and time steps. We
evaluate our approach on autonomous driving datasets for both marginal and
joint motion prediction, and achieve state of the art performance across two
popular datasets. Through combining a scene-centric approach, agent permutation
equivariant model, and a sequence masking strategy, we show that our model can
unify a variety of motion prediction tasks from joint motion predictions to
conditioned prediction.

timing constraints and probabilistic failures on demand. The analysis whether
such systems with probabilistic timed behavior ad-here to a given specification
is essential. When the states of the system can be represented by graphs, the
rule-based formalism of Probabilistic Timed Graph Transformation Systems
(PTGTSs) can be used to suitably capture structure dynamics as well as
probabilistic and timed behavior of the system. The model checking support for
PTGTSs w.r.t. properties specified using Probabilistic Timed Computation Tree
Logic (PTCTL) has been already presented. Moreover, for timed graph-based
runtime monitoring, Metric Temporal Graph Logic (MTGL) has been developed for
stating metric temporal properties on identified subgraphs and their structural
changes over time. In this paper, we (a) extend MTGL to the Probabilistic
Metric Temporal Graph Logic (PMTGL) by allowing for the specification of
probabilistic properties, (b) adapt our MTGL satisfaction checking approach to
PTGTSs, and (c) combine the approaches for PTCTL model checking and MTGL
satisfaction checking to obtain a Bounded Model Checking (BMC) approach for
PMTGL. In our evaluation, we apply an implementation of our BMC approach in
AutoGraph to a running example.

existence of mirror neurons that seem to be involved in multi-modal action

enable understanding actions and goals of other agents is still a challenging
question. In this study, we propose a novel method, deep modality blending
networks (DMBN), that creates a common latent space from multi-modal experience
of a robot by blending multi-modal signals with a stochastic weighting
mechanism. We show for the first time that deep learning, when combined with a
novel modality blending scheme, can facilitate action recognition and produce
structures to sustain anatomical and effect-based imitation capabilities. Our
proposed system, can be conditioned on any desired sensory/motor value at any
time-step, and can generate a complete multi-modal trajectory consistent with
the desired conditioning in parallel avoiding accumulation of prediction
errors. We further showed that given desired images from different
perspectives, i.e. images generated by the observation of other robots placed
on different sides of the table, our system could generate image and joint
angle sequences that correspond to either anatomical or effect based imitation
behavior. Overall, the proposed DMBN architecture not only serves as a
computational model for sustaining mirror neuron-like capabilities, but also
stands as a powerful machine learning architecture for high-dimensional
multi-modal temporal data with robust retrieval capabilities operating with

Instead of using healthy speech as a source, we customise an existing

approach alleviates the evaluation problem one normally has when converting
typical speech to pathological speech, as in our approach, the voice conversion
(VC) model does not need to be optimised for speech degradation but only for
the speaker change. This change in the optimisation ensures that any
degradation found in naturalness is due to the conversion process and not due
to the model exaggerating characteristics of a speech pathology. To show a
proof of concept of this method, we convert dysarthric speech using the
UASpeech database and an autoencoder-based VC technique. Subjective evaluation
results show reasonable naturalness for high intelligibility dysarthric
speakers, though lower intelligibility seems to introduce a marginal
degradation in naturalness scores for mid and low intelligibility speakers
compared to ground truth. Conversion of speaker characteristics for low and
high intelligibility speakers is successful, but not for mid. Whether the
differences in the results for the different intelligibility levels is due to
the intelligibility levels or due to the speakers needs to be further
investigated.

arbitrarily small as the approximation gets finer. Two numerical examples
demonstrate the performance of the optimal control and guidance obtained from

strengthening mechanism. This is numerically analyzed within a continuum
framework based on a higher order strain gradient plasticity theory and by use
of an axi-symmetric unit cell model. The unit cell contains a spherical
particle which is resilient to inelastic deformation and embedded in a
homogeneous matrix material. An interface with special characteristics, that
separates the particle from the matrix, plays a key role for the overall
strengthening. Based on a systematic parametric study a closed form relation is
deduced and proposed for the increase in the overall yield stress. This
relation is limited to materials containing elastic particles with spacing
smaller than the material length scale and volume fractions less than 10 $\%$.
It these conditions are met, the plastic strain field in the material becomes
essentially constant on the scale of particle spacing. The character of the
solution suggests that this result is general despite the simplicity of the
unit cell employed in the parametric study. Predictions from the closed form
relation is compared with published experimental results, and good agreement is
observed in some metal matrix composites and alloys. The influence of a
mismatch in elastic modulus between particles and matrix is elucidated, and
effects on post yield strain hardening are discussed.

``replace'' some of the elements of the composite system with surrogate
\textit{force fields}. In the realm of quantum mechanics, however, such a
description is rarely compatible with the formalism of the theory.
Nevertheless, the quantum version of external field models---the so-called
\textit{noise representations}---can be employed in certain circumstances. The
mathematics behind these models indicate that the appearing fields typically
exhibit random fluctuations, hence, the name \textit{noise field} is more apt.
In principle, measuring a classical force field is a trivial task; all that is
needed is a probe equipped with an accelerometer that can be moved around while
taking the measure of forces that affect it. Unfortunately, an analogous method
cannot work in the quantum case. As indicated by the theory, the result of any
measurement performed on the quantum system affected by a noise field always
appears as an average over fluctuations, therefore, it is impossible to observe
the noise fluctuations by measuring the state of the probe. Here, we
demonstrate that this limitation can be circumvented and that it is possible to
expose the noise field fluctuations to direct observation. This allows one to
sample the noise trajectories (stochastic realizations), store them, and later
use them to simulate the dynamics of open quantum systems affected by the
noise.

approach has emerged whereby passive structured materials can perform
classification tasks by directly using free-space propagation and diffraction
of light. In this manuscript, we present a theoretical and computational study
of such systems and establish the basic features that govern their performance.
We show that system architecture, material structure, and input light field are
intertwined and need to be co-designed to maximize classification accuracy. Our
simulations show that a single layer metasurface can achieve classification
accuracy better than conventional linear classifiers, with an order of
magnitude fewer diffractive features than previously reported. For a wavelength
{\lambda}, single layer metasurfaces of size with aperture density achieve ~96%
testing accuracy on the MNIST dataset, for an optimized distance ~ to the
output plane. This is enabled by an intrinsic nonlinearity in photodetection,
despite the use of linear optical metamaterials. Furthermore, we find that once
the system is optimized, the number of diffractive features is the main
determinant of classification performance. The slow asymptotic scaling with the
number of apertures suggests a reason why such systems may benefit from
multiple layer designs. Finally, we show a trade-off between the number of
apertures and fabrication noise.

show its benefit in the financial markets. We use a deep Q-network (DQN) to
design long-short trading strategies for futures contracts. The state space
consists of volatility-normalized daily returns, with buying or selling being
the reinforcement learning action and the total reward defined as the
cumulative profits from our actions. Our trading strategy is trained and tested

and their host dark matter halos, which is important both for galaxy evolution
and cosmology. We extend the measurement and modeling of the galaxy-galaxy
lensing signal in the recent Dark Energy Survey Year 3 cosmology analysis to
the highly nonlinear scales ($\sim 100$ kpc). This extension enables us to
study the galaxy-halo connection via a Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD)
framework for the two lens samples used in the cosmology analysis: a luminous
red galaxy sample (redMaGiC) and a magnitude-limited galaxy sample (MagLim). We
find that redMaGiC (MagLim) galaxies typically live in dark matter halos of
mass $\log_{10}(M_{h}/M_{\odot}) \approx 13.7$ which is roughly constant over
redshift ($13.3-13.5$ depending on redshift). We constrain these masses to
$\sim 15\%$, approximately $1.5$ times improvement over previous work. We also
constrain the linear galaxy bias more than 5 times better than what is inferred
by the cosmological scales only. We find the satellite fraction for redMaGiC
(MagLim) to be $\sim 0.1-0.2$ ($0.1-0.3$) with no clear trend in redshift. Our
constraints on these halo properties are broadly consistent with other
available estimates from previous work, large-scale constraints and
simulations. The framework built in this paper will be used for future HOD
studies with other galaxy samples and extensions for cosmological analyses.

the holomorphic SU(3) scalar sector to a dynamical 15-vertex model, which
corresponds to an RSOS model, whose adjacency graph can be read off from the
gauge theory quiver/brane tiling. One scalar SU(2) sub-sector is described by
an alternating nearest-neighbour Hamiltonian, while another choice of SU(2)

a common vacuum state, around which the magnon dispersion relations are
naturally uniformised by elliptic functions. Concretely, for the $\mathbb{Z}_2$

that agents are able to process and reason with such data in real time. Whereas
reasoning over time-annotated data with background knowledge may be
challenging, due to the volume and velocity in which such data is being
produced, such complex reasoning is necessary in scenarios where agents need to
discover potential problems and this cannot be done with simple stream
processing techniques. Stream Reasoners aim at bridging this gap between
reasoning and stream processing and LASER is such a stream reasoner designed to
analyse and perform complex reasoning over streams of data. It is based on
LARS, a rule-based logical language extending Answer Set Programming, and it
has shown better runtime results than other state-of-the-art stream reasoning
systems. Nevertheless, for high levels of data throughput even LASER may be
unable to compute answers in a timely fashion. In this paper, we study whether
Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks, which have shown to be

that established MPC approaches are applicable for specific uncertainty types.
However, for a number of applications, especially automated vehicles,
uncertainty in predicting the future behavior of other agents is more suitably
modeled by a twofold description: a high-level task uncertainty and a low-level
execution uncertainty of individual tasks. In this work, we present an MPC
framework that is capable of dealing with this twofold uncertainty. A scenario
MPC approach considers the possibility of other agents performing one of
multiple tasks, with an arbitrary probability distribution, while an analytic
stochastic MPC method handles execution uncertainty within a specific task,
based on a Gaussian distribution. Combining both approaches allows to
efficiently handle the twofold uncertainty structure of many applications.
Application of the proposed MPC method is demonstrated in an automated vehicle

Kerr-Newman black holes in general relativity, characterized by their mass

well with the band gap in element-specific joint density of states calculations
based on ab initio estimates of the electronic structure in both the low
temperature monoclinic and the high temperature orthorhombic structure. Below
$T_c$, the RIXS energy-momentum map shows a minimal gap at the Brillouin zone
center ($\sim$ 0.16 eV), confirming that Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ possesses a direct band
gap in its low temperature ground state. However, inside the gap, no signature
of anticipated collective modes with an energy scale comparable to the gap size
can be identified. Upon increasing the temperature to above $T_c$, whereas the
gap at the zone center closes, the RIXS map at finite momenta still possesses
the gross features of the low temperature map, suggesting a substantial mixing
between the Ta and Ni orbits in the conduction and valence bands, which does
not change substantially across the phase transition. Our experimental

additional data to expressions we operate on during compilation. For instance,
some substructural type theories augment variables' typing judgments with the
information of their usage. That is, they allow one to explicitly state how
many times - 0, 1, or many - a variable can be used. This solves the problem of
resource usage control and allows us to treat variables as resources.
  What's more, it often happens that this attributed information is interpreted
(used) during the same compilation and erased before we run a program. A case
in the point is that in the same substructural type theories, their type
checkers use these 0, 1, or many, to ensure that all variables are used as many
times as these attributions say them to be.
  Yet, there wasn't any programming language concept whose concern would be to
allow a programmer to express these attributions in the language itself. That
is, to let the programmer express which data the one wants to attribute to what
expressions and, most importantly, the meaning of the attributed data in their
program.
  As it turned out, the presence of such a concept allows us to express many
practical ideas in the language itself. For instance, with appropriate means
for assigning the meaning of these attributions, this concept would allow one
to express linear types as functionality in a separate program module, without
the need to refine the whole type system to add them.
  In this paper, we present such a concept - we propose type properties. It
allows a programmer to express these attributions while fulfilling the
requirement of being fully on the static level. That is, it allows one to
express how to interpret these attributions during compilation and erases them
before a program is passed to the runtime.

limit their utility in devices. Here we report the simultaneous electrostatic
and magnetic control of electronic transport in atomically-thin CrSBr, an
A-type antiferromagnetic semiconductor. Through magnetotransport measurements,
we find that spin-flip scattering from the interlayer antiferromagnetic
configuration of multilayer flakes results in giant negative magnetoresistance.
Conversely, magnetoresistance of the ferromagnetic monolayer CrSBr vanishes
below the Curie temperature. A second transition ascribed to the ferromagnetic
ordering of magnetic defects manifests in a large positive magnetoresistance in
the monolayer and a sudden increase of the bulk magnetic susceptibility. We
demonstrate this magnetoresistance is tunable with an electrostatic gate,

dominated by the neutron one as in the case of neutron star cores containing
only nucleons. In particular, we find that neutrons dominate the total thermal
conductivity over the whole range of densities explored and that, due to the
onset of $\Sigma^-$ which leads to the deleptonization of the neutron star
core, they dominate also the shear viscosity in the high density region, in
contrast with the pure nucleonic case where the lepton contribution is always
the dominant one.

privacy have increasingly motivated the need for private inference (PI). While
recent work demonstrates PI is possible using cryptographic primitives, the
computational overheads render it impractical. The community is largely
unprepared to address these overheads, as the source of slowdown in PI stems
from the ReLU operator whereas optimizations for plaintext inference focus on
optimizing FLOPs. In this paper we re-think the ReLU computation and propose
optimizations for PI tailored to properties of neural networks. Specifically,
we reformulate ReLU as an approximate sign test and introduce a novel
truncation method for the sign test that significantly reduces the cost per
ReLU. These optimizations result in a specific type of stochastic ReLU. The key
observation is that the stochastic fault behavior is well suited for the
fault-tolerant properties of neural network inference. Thus, we provide
significant savings without impacting accuracy. We collectively call the
optimizations Circa and demonstrate improvements of up to 4.7x storage and 3x
runtime over baseline implementations; we further show that Circa can be used
on top of recent PI optimizations to obtain 1.8x additional speedup.

Hamiltonians describing topological insulators and superconductors in Euclidean
space by means of domain walls. Augmenting a given Hamiltonian by one or

Fedosov-H\""ormander formula implementing in Euclidean spaces an Atiyah-Singer
index theorem allows for an explicit computation of the index in terms of the

decomposition in a Clifford algebra, the index is given by the easily
computable degree of a naturally associated map.
  A practically important property of topological insulators is the asymmetric
transport observed along one-dimensional lines generated by the domain walls.
This asymmetry is captured by a line conductivity, a physical observable of the
system. We prove that the line conductivity is quantized and given by the index
of a second Fredholm operator of Toeplitz type. We also prove a topological
charge conservation stating that the two aforementioned indices agree. This
result generalizes to higher dimensions and higher-order topological insulators
the bulk-edge correspondence of two-dimensional materials.

propagating. Topological modes that are initially narrow modes naturally tend

robustness to sensor and object model uncertainty. The two dominant approaches
design either grasp-quality scoring or anchor-based grasp recognition networks.
This paper presents a different approach to grasp detection by treating it as
keypoint detection in image-space. The deep network detects each grasp
candidate as a pair of keypoints, convertible to the grasp representationg =
{x, y, w, {\theta}} T , rather than a triplet or quartet of corner points.
Decreasing the detection difficulty by grouping keypoints into pairs boosts
performance. To promote capturing dependencies between keypoints, a non-local
module is incorporated into the network design. A final filtering strategy
based on discrete and continuous orientation prediction removes false
correspondences and further improves grasp detection performance. GKNet, the
approach presented here, achieves a good balance between accuracy and speed on
the Cornell and the abridged Jacquard datasets (96.9% and 98.39% at 41.67 and
23.26 fps). Follow-up experiments on a manipulator evaluate GKNet using 4 types
of grasping experiments reflecting different nuisance sources: static grasping,
dynamic grasping, grasping at varied camera angles, and bin picking. GKNet
outperforms reference baselines in static and dynamic grasping experiments
while showing robustness to varied camera viewpoints and moderate clutter. The
results confirm the hypothesis that grasp keypoints are an effective output
representation for deep grasp networks that provide robustness to expected
nuisance factors.

networks (GCN) that are targeted to heterogeneous graphs in which nodes and
edges have associated type information that can be exploited to improve
inference accuracy. GTNs learn important metapaths in the graph, create
weighted edges for these metapaths, and use the resulting graph in a GCN.
Currently, the only available implementation of GTNs uses dense matrix
multiplication to find metapaths. Unfortunately, the space overhead of this
approach can be large, so in practice it is used only for small graphs. In
addition, the matrix-based implementation is not fine-grained enough to use
random-walk based methods to optimize metapath finding. In this paper, we
present a graph-based formulation and implementation of the GTN metapath
finding problem. This graph-based formulation has two advantages over the
matrix-based approach. First, it is more space efficient than the original GTN
implementation and more compute-efficient for metapath sizes of practical
interest. Second, it permits us to implement a sampling method that reduces the
number of metapaths that must be enumerated, allowing the implementation to be
used for larger graphs and larger metapath sizes. Experimental results show
that our implementation is $6.5\times$ faster than the original GTN
implementation on average for a metapath length of 4, and our sampling
implementation is $155\times$ faster on average than this implementation
without compromising on the accuracy of the GTN.

Things, where massive visual signals have to be compressed and fed into
machines. But facing such big data and constrained bandwidth capacity, existing
image/video compression methods lead to very low-quality representations, while
existing feature compression techniques fail to support diversified visual
analytics applications/tasks with low-bit-rate representations. In this paper,
we raise and study the novel problem of supporting multiple machine vision
analytics tasks with the compressed visual representation, namely, the
information compression problem in analytics taxonomy. By utilizing the
intrinsic transferability among different tasks, our framework successfully
constructs compact and expressive representations at low bit-rates to support a
diversified set of machine vision tasks, including both high-level
semantic-related tasks and mid-level geometry analytic tasks. In order to
impose compactness in the representations, we propose a codebook-based
hyperprior, which helps map the representation into a low-dimensional manifold.
As it well fits the signal structure of the deep visual feature, it facilitates
more accurate entropy estimation, and results in higher compression efficiency.
With the proposed framework and the codebook-based hyperprior, we further
investigate the relationship of different task features owning different levels
of abstraction granularity. Experimental results demonstrate that with the
proposed scheme, a set of diversified tasks can be supported at a significantly

clues reveal so much about what happens in the scene, make the audio-visual
space a perfectly intuitive choice for self-supervised representation learning.
However, the current literature suggests that training on \textit{uncurated}
data yields considerably poorer representations compared to the
\textit{curated} alternatives collected in supervised manner, and the gap only
narrows when the volume of data significantly increases. Furthermore, the
quality of learned representations is known to be heavily influenced by the
size and taxonomy of the curated datasets used for self-supervised training.
This begs the question of whether we are celebrating too early on catching up
with supervised learning when our self-supervised efforts still rely almost
exclusively on curated data. In this paper, we study the efficacy of learning
from Movies and TV Shows as forms of uncurated data for audio-visual
self-supervised learning. We demonstrate that a simple model based on
contrastive learning, trained on a collection of movies and TV shows, not only
dramatically outperforms more complex methods which are trained on orders of
magnitude larger uncurated datasets, but also performs very competitively with
the state-of-the-art that learns from large-scale curated data. We identify
that audiovisual patterns like the appearance of the main character or
prominent scenes and mise-en-sc\`ene which frequently occur through the whole
duration of a movie, lead to an overabundance of easy negative instances in the
contrastive learning formulation. Capitalizing on such observation, we propose
a hierarchical sampling policy, which despite its simplicity, effectively
improves the performance, particularly when learning from TV shows which
naturally face less semantic diversity.

equations on the half plane is considered under the no-slip boundary condition.
When the initial deformation tensor is a perturbation of the identity matrix
and the initial density is near a positive constant, we establish the uniform
estimates of solutions to the compressible viscoelastic flows in the conormal
Sobolev spaces. It is well-known that for the corresponding inviscid limit of
the compressible Navier-Stokes equations with the no-slip boundary condition,
one does not expect the uniform energy estimates of solutions due to the
appearance of strong boundary layers. However, when the deformation tensor
effect is taken into account, our results show that the deformation tensor
plays an important role in the vanishing viscosity process and can prevent the
formation of strong boundary layers. As a result we are able to justify the
inviscid limit of solutions for the compressible viscous flows under the
no-slip boundary condition governed by the viscoelastic equations, based on the
uniform conormal regularity estimates achieved in this paper.

best target for studying the tilted disk in cataclysmic variable stars. In a
previous paper by Kimura, Osaki, and Kato (2020), we analyzed its Kepler light
curves and found that its orbital light curves during the brightening stage
were dominated by the reflection effect of the secondary star and varied with
the orientation of the tilted disk; the amplitude was maximized at the minimum
of the super-orbital signal and the phase of the light maximum shifted to an
earlier one with the advance of the super-orbital phase. We argued there that
this was the direct evidence of the retrogradely precessing tilted disk as the
secondary star acts like a reflecting object. In order to confirm this
interpretation, we have performed numerical modeling of orbital light curves in
this paper. We have succeeded in reproducing the main characteristics of the
observed orbital light curves by a simple model in which the secondary star is
irradiated by the tilted disk. We have also constrained the inclination angle,
$i$, of the binary system and the tilt angle, $\theta$, of the disk purely from
photometric considerations. The best-fitting parameter set is found to be $i
\sim$45~deg and $\theta \sim$2.0~deg, respectively. The orbital inclination
thus estimated is consistent with that obtained from the spectroscopic
considerations within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, the tilt angle
of the disk could be underestimated by using only the semi-amplitude of
super-orbital signals.

As a result, most existing prosody style transfer algorithms would need to rely
on some form of text transcriptions to identify the content information, which
confines their application to high-resource languages only. Recently,
SpeechSplit has made sizeable progress towards unsupervised prosody style
transfer, but it is unable to extract high-level global prosody style in an

conveniently parameterizes the effects of interaction range, but also serves as
simple physical model of confined, parallel arrays of polyelectrolyte filaments
or vortices in type-II superconductors. The countervailing tendencies of
repulsions and confinement to, respectively, spread and concentrate particle
density leads to an energetic preference for non-uniform densities in the
clusters. Ground states in such systems have previously been modeled as {\it
conformal crystals}, which are composed of locally equitriangular packings
whose local areal densities exhibit long range gradients. Here, we assess two
theoretical models that connect the preference for non-uniform density to the
formation of disclination defects, one of which assumes a continuum
distributions of defect, while the second considers the quantized and localized
nature of disclinations in hexagonal conformal crystals. Comparing both models
to numerical simulations of discrete particles clusters, we study the influence
of interaction range and confining potential on defects in ground states. We
show that treating disclinations as continuously distributable well-captures
the number of topological defects in the ground state in the regime of
long-range interactions, while as interactions become shorter range, it
dramatically overpredicts the to growth in total defect charge. Analysis of the
discretized defect theory suggests that limitations of the continuous defect
theory can be attributed to the asymmetry in the placement of positive vs.
negative disclinations in the conformal crystal ground states, as well as a
strongly asymmetric dependence of self-energy of disclinations on sign of

three passages of weak shocks with low sonic Mach numbers, $M\lesssim 3$,

accelerated to become high energy cosmic rays (CRs) at such ICM shocks via
diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). We examine the effects of DSA by multiple
shocks on the spectrum of accelerated CRs by including {\it in situ}
injection/acceleration at each shock, followed by repeated re-acceleration at
successive shocks in the test-particle regime. For simplicity, the accelerated
particles are assumed to undergo adiabatic decompression without energy loss
and escape from the system, before they encounter subsequent shocks. We show
that in general the CR spectrum is flattened by multiple shock passages,
compared to a single episode of DSA, and that the acceleration efficiency
increases with successive shock passages. However, the decompression due to the
expansion of shocks into the cluster outskirts may reduce the amplification and
flattening of the CR spectrum by multiple shock passages. The final CR spectrum
behind the last shock is determined by the accumulated effects of repeated
re-acceleration by all previous shocks, but it is relatively insensitive to the
ordering of the shock Mach numbers. Thus multiple passages of shocks may cause
the slope of the CR spectrum to deviate from the canonical DSA power-law slope

  We first produce a CPU-cheap large proposal sample, of uncorrelated entries,
by drawing from the family of complex Wishart distributions, and then reject or

young children who encounter persistent difficulties in producing certain
speech sounds at the expected age. Consonant errors are the major indicator of
SSD in clinical assessment. Previous studies on automatic assessment of SSD
revealed that detection of speech errors concerning short and transitory
consonants is less satisfactory. This paper investigates a neural network based
approach to detecting consonant errors in disordered speech using
consonant-vowel (CV) diphone segment in comparison to using consonant monophone
segment. The underlying assumption is that the vowel part of a CV segment
carries important information of co-articulation from the consonant. Speech
embeddings are extracted from CV segments by a recurrent neural network model.
The similarity scores between the embeddings of the test segment and the
reference segments are computed to determine if the test segment is the
expected consonant or not. Experimental results show that using CV segments
achieves improved performance on detecting speech errors concerning those
""difficult"" consonants reported in the previous studies.

can corrupt a majority of the dataset. Specifically, we are given a set $T$ of
$n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and a parameter $0< \alpha <\frac 1 2$ such that
an $\alpha$-fraction of the points in $T$ are i.i.d. samples from a
well-behaved distribution $\mathcal{D}$ and the remaining $(1-\alpha)$-fraction

which is close to the mean of $\mathcal{D}$. We develop new algorithms for
list-decodable mean estimation, achieving nearly-optimal statistical
guarantees, with running time $O(n^{1 + \epsilon_0} d)$, for any fixed
$\epsilon_0 > 0$. All prior algorithms for this problem had additional
polynomial factors in $\frac 1 \alpha$. We leverage this result, together with
additional techniques, to obtain the first almost-linear time algorithms for
clustering mixtures of $k$ separated well-behaved distributions,
nearly-matching the statistical guarantees of spectral methods. Prior
clustering algorithms inherently relied on an application of $k$-PCA, thereby
incurring runtimes of $\Omega(n d k)$. This marks the first runtime improvement
for this basic statistical problem in nearly two decades.
  The starting point of our approach is a novel and simpler near-linear time
robust mean estimation algorithm in the $\alpha \to 1$ regime, based on a
one-shot matrix multiplicative weights-inspired potential decrease. We
crucially leverage this new algorithmic framework in the context of the
iterative multi-filtering technique of Diakonikolas et al. '18, '20, providing
a method to simultaneously cluster and downsample points using one-dimensional
projections -- thus, bypassing the $k$-PCA subroutines required by prior

will be among the first Earth-sized planets to be characterized with upcoming
telescopes. It has previously been argued that waterworlds-particularly those
possessing more than 1% H$_2$O-experience limited melt production and
outgassing due to the immense pressure overburden of their overlying oceans,
unless subject to high internal heating. But an additional, underappreciated
obstacle to outgassing on waterworlds is the high solubility of volatiles in
high-pressure melts. Here, we investigate this phenomenon and show that
volatile solubilities in melts probably prevent almost all magmatic outgassing
from waterworlds. Specifically, for Earth-like gravity and oceanic crust
composition, oceans or water ice exceeding 10-100 km in depth (0.1-1 GPa)
preclude the exsolution of volatiles from partial melt of silicates. This
solubility limit compounds the pressure overburden effect as large surface
oceans limit both melt production and degassing from any partial melt that is
produced. We apply these calculations to Trappist-1 planets to show that, given
current mass and radius constraints and implied surface water inventories,
Trappist-1f and -1g are unlikely to experience volcanic degassing. While other
mechanisms for interior-surface volatile exchange are not completely excluded,
the suppression of magmatic outgassing simplifies the range of possible
atmospheric evolution trajectories and has implications for interpretation of
ostensible biosignature gases, which we illustrate with a coupled model of
planetary interior-climate-atmosphere evolution.

relationship contains the same object (or predicate), they may not be visually
or semantically similar, 2) Asymmetry: despite the nature of the relationship
that embodied the direction, it was not well addressed in previous studies, and
3) Higher-order contexts: leveraging the identities of certain graph elements

design a novel SGG framework, Local-to-Global Interaction Networks (LOGIN).
Locally, interactions extract the essence between three instances of subject,
object, and background, while baking direction awareness into the network by
explicitly constraining the input order of subject and object. Globally,
interactions encode the contexts between every graph component (i.e., nodes and
edges). Finally, Attract & Repel loss is utilized to fine-tune the distribution
of predicate embeddings. By design, our framework enables predicting the scene
graph in a bottom-up manner, leveraging the possible complementariness. To
quantify how much LOGIN is aware of relational direction, a new diagnostic task

physical properties of materials. It is crucial to know how surface termination
affects the metal-insulator transition (MIT) of V$_2$O$_3$ films for both
fundamental understanding and its applications. By changing growth parameters,
we achieved a variety of surface terminations in V$_2$O$_3$ films that are
characterized by low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and photoemission
spectroscopy techniques. Depending upon the terminations, our results show MIT
can be partially or fully suppressed near the surface region due to the
different filling of the electrons at the surface and sub-surface layers and
change of screening length compared to the bulk. Across MIT, a strong
redistribution of spectral weight and its transfer from high-to-low binding
energy regime is observed in a wide-energy-scale. Our results show total
spectral weight in the low-energy regime is not conserved across MIT,
indicating a breakdown of `sum rules of spectral weight', a signature of a
strongly correlated system. Such change in spectral weight is possibly linked
to the change in hybridization, lattice volume ({\it i.e.,} effective carrier
density), and spin degree of freedom in the system that happens across MIT. We
find that MIT in this system is strongly correlation-driven where the
electron-electron interactions play a pivotal role. Moreover, our results
provide a better insight in understanding the electronic structure of strongly
correlated systems and highlight the importance of accounting surface effects
during interpretation of the physical property data mainly using surface
sensitive probes, such as surface resistivity.

encountered when performing attenuation correction, which is necessary for
quantitative PET evaluation. The combined PET/MRI scanning requires the
generation of attenuation-correction maps from MRI owing to no direct
relationship between the gamma-ray attenuation information and MRIs. While
MRI-based bone-tissue segmentation can be readily performed for the head and
pelvis regions, the realization of accurate bone segmentation via chest CT
generation remains a challenging task. This can be attributed to the
respiratory and cardiac motions occurring in the chest as well as its
anatomically complicated structure and relatively thin bone cortex. This paper
presents a means to minimise the anatomical structural changes without human

drawn considerable attention in the biometrics community. Morphed images have
exposed face recognition systems' susceptibility to false acceptance, resulting
in dire consequences, especially for national security applications. To detect
morphing attacks, we propose a method which is based on a discriminative 2D
Discrete Wavelet Transform (2D-DWT). A discriminative wavelet sub-band can
highlight inconsistencies between a real and a morphed image. We observe that
there is a salient discrepancy between the entropy of a given sub-band in a
bona fide image, and the same sub-band's entropy in a morphed sample.
Considering this dissimilarity between these two entropy values, we find the
Kullback-Leibler divergence between the two distributions, namely the entropy
of the bona fide and the corresponding morphed images. The most discriminative
wavelet sub-bands are those with the highest corresponding KL-divergence
values. Accordingly, 22 sub-bands are selected as the most discriminative ones
in terms of morph detection. We show that a Deep Neural Network (DNN) trained
on the 22 discriminative sub-bands can detect morphed samples precisely. Most
importantly, the effectiveness of our algorithm is validated through
experiments on three datasets: VISAPP17, LMA, and MorGAN. We also performed an

obtain precise constraints on their dust properties using simple isothermal
models. Thanks to our new 2mm observations, the dust emissivity index is
well-constrained and robust against different dust opacity assumptions. The
median dust emissivity index of our SMGs is $\beta\simeq1.9\pm0.4$, consistent
with the emissivity index of dust in the Milky Way and other local and

existing anomaly detection databases encounter two major problems. Firstly,
they are limited in scale. Secondly, training sets contain only video-level

we contribute a new Large-scale Anomaly Detection (LAD) database as the
benchmark for anomaly detection in video sequences, which is featured in two
aspects. 1) It contains 2000 video sequences including normal and abnormal
video clips with 14 anomaly categories including crash, fire, violence, etc.
with large scene varieties, making it the largest anomaly analysis database to

video frame) to facilitate anomaly detection. Leveraging the above benefits
from the LAD database, we further formulate anomaly detection as a
fully-supervised learning problem and propose a multi-task deep neural network

using an Inflated 3D convolutional (I3D) network. Then we construct a recurrent
convolutional neural network fed the local spatiotemporal contextual feature to

spatial concepts using spoken user utterances. A robot with a flexible spoken
dialog system must be able to acquire linguistic representation and its meaning
specific to an environment through interactions with humans as children do.
Specifically, relative spatial concepts (e.g., front and right) are widely used
in our daily lives, however, it is not obvious which object is a reference
object when a robot learns relative spatial concepts. Therefore, we propose
methods by which a robot without prior knowledge of words can learn relative
spatial concepts. The methods are formulated using a probabilistic model to
estimate the proper reference objects and distributions representing concepts
simultaneously. The experimental results show that relative spatial concepts
and a phoneme sequence representing each concept can be learned under the
condition that the robot does not know which located object is the reference
object. Additionally, we show that two processes in the proposed method improve
the estimation accuracy of the concepts: generating candidate word sequences by
class n-gram and selecting word sequences using location information.
Furthermore, we show that clues to reference objects improve accuracy even
though the number of candidate reference objects increases.

notable application of GANs is developing fake human faces, also known as ""deep

Measuring the quality of the generated images is inherently subjective but
attempts to objectify quality using standardized metrics have been made. One
example of objective metrics is the Frechet Inception Distance (FID), which
measures the difference between distributions of feature vectors for two
separate datasets of images. There are situations that images with low
perceptual qualities are not assigned appropriate FID scores. We propose to
improve the robustness of the evaluation process by integrating lower-level
features to cover a wider array of visual defects. Our proposed method
integrates three levels of feature abstractions to evaluate the quality of

2I/Borisov, are abundant in the interstellar medium of the Milky Way. This
means that the interstellar medium, including molecular cloud regions, has
three components: gas, dust, and ISOs. From the observational constraints for
the field density of ISOs drifting in the solar neighbourhood, we infer a
typical molecular cloud of 10 pc diameter contains some 10$^{18}$ ISOs. At
typical sizes ranging from hundreds of metres to tens of km, ISOs are entirely
decoupled from the gas dynamics in these molecular clouds. Here we address the
question of whether ISOs can follow the collapse of molecular clouds. We
perform low-resolution simulations of the collapse of molecular clouds
containing initially static ISO populations toward the point where stars form.
In this proof-of-principle study, we find that the interstellar objects
definitely follow the collapse of the gas -- and many become bound to the
new-forming numerical approximations to future stars (sinks). At minimum, 40\%
of all sinks have one or more ISO test particles gravitationally bound to them
for the initial ISO distributions tested here. This value corresponds to at
least $10^{10}$ actual interstellar objects being bound after three initial
free-fall times. Thus, ISOs are a relevant component of star formation. We find
that more massive sinks bind disproportionately large fractions of the initial
ISO population, implying competitive capture of ISOs. Sinks can also be
solitary, as their ISOs can become unbound again -- particularly if sinks are
ejected from the system. Emerging planetary systems will thus develop in
remarkably varied environments, ranging from solitary to richly populated with
bound ISOs.

the case in which the cost function is a simple quadratic cost and the excluded

We show that depending on the density of constraints, one can have different
situations. If the number of constraints is small, one typically has a phase
where the ground state of the cost function is unique and sits on the boundary
of the island of configurations allowed by the constraints. In this case, there
is a hypostatic number of marginally satisfied constraints. If the number of
constraints is increased one enters a glassy phase where the cost function has
many local minima sitting again on the boundary of the regions of allowed
configurations. At the phase transition point, the total number of marginally
satisfied constraints becomes equal to the number of degrees of freedom in the
problem and therefore we say that these minima are isostatic. We conjecture
that by increasing further the constraints the system stays isostatic up to the
point where the volume of available phase space shrinks to zero. We derive our
results using the replica method and we also analyze a dynamical algorithm, the

our algorithm is locally linearly convergent when applied to these problems. We
then extend our method to solve DC programs with a single specially structured

solve two concrete optimization problems, namely, group-structured compressed
sensing problems with Gaussian measurement noise and compressed sensing
problems with Cauchy measurement noise, and illustrate the empirical

STAR-RIS plays an important role in adjusting the decoding order of hybrid
users for efficient interference mitigation and omni-directional coverage
extension. To capture the impact of non-ideal wireless channels on AirFL, a
closed-form expression for the optimality gap (a.k.a. convergence upper bound)
between the actual loss and the optimal loss is derived. This analysis reveals
that the learning performance is significantly affected by the active and
passive beamforming schemes as well as wireless noise. Furthermore, when the
learning rate diminishes as the training proceeds, the optimality gap is
explicitly shown to converge with linear rate. To accelerate convergence while
satisfying quality-of-service requirements, a mixed-integer non-linear
programming (MINLP) problem is formulated by jointly designing the transmit
power at users and the configuration mode of STAR-RIS. Next, a trust
region-based successive convex approximation method and a penalty-based
semidefinite relaxation approach are proposed to handle the decoupled
non-convex subproblems iteratively. An alternating optimization algorithm is
then developed to find a suboptimal solution for the original MINLP problem.
Extensive simulation results show that i) the proposed framework can
efficiently support NOMA and AirFL users via concurrent uplink communications,
ii) our algorithms achieve faster convergence rate on IID and non-IID settings

Although more generally applicable, the is focus on airborne maritime radar
systems. Hence K-distributed sea clutter is used as the main example. Detection
via square-law non-coherent pulse integration is formulated in a way that
accommodates arbitrary partial correlation for both target radar cross-section

in previous work was the fact that Swerling's original characterization of the
standard RCS fluctuation classes as gamma distributions for the power is not
sufficient for the inclusion of both correlation sources (i.e.target and

required at the quadrature component (i.e. voltage) level, as phase

multi-speaker automatic speech recognition (ASR). In this study, we extend our

Experiments on WSJ0-Mix and LibriMix corpora show that our model outperforms
other NAR models with only a slight increase of latency, achieving WERs of
22.3% and 24.9%, respectively. Moreover, by including the data of variable

distribution from its samples observed under a $b$-bit communication
constraint. The best-known previous result on $\ell_2$ estimation error for
this problem is $O\left( \frac{s\log\left( {d}/{s}\right)}{n2^b}\right)$.
Surprisingly, we show that when sample size $n$ exceeds a minimum threshold
$n^*(s, d, b)$, we can achieve an $\ell_2$ estimation error of $O\left(

rate does not depend on the ambient dimension $d$ and is the same as knowing
the support of the distribution beforehand.
  We next ask the question: ``what is the minimum $n^*(s, d, b)$ that allows
dimension-free convergence?''. To upper bound $n^*(s, d, b)$, we develop novel
localization schemes to accurately and efficiently localize the unknown

GP-UCB) to optimize a black-box function through sequential evaluations.
However, for functions with continuous domains, Gaussian process optimization
has to rely on either a fixed discretization of the space, or the solution of a
non-convex optimization subproblem at each evaluation. The first approach can
negatively affect performance, while the second approach requires a heavy
computational burden. A third option, only recently theoretically studied, is
to adaptively discretize the function domain. Even though this approach avoids
the extra non-convex optimization costs, the overall computational complexity
is still prohibitive. An algorithm such as GP-UCB has a runtime of $O(T^4)$,
where $T$ is the number of iterations. In this paper, we introduce Ada-BKB

$\gamma(R_s)$ gave a dominant contribution $\propto 1/R_s^2$, although the
consistency of $\gamma(R_s)$ with the asymptotic behavior of the

step counting, activity recognition, and hand-to-face gesture interaction. With
data collected from 31 subjects, we show that OESense achieves 99.3% step

focus on prototypical examples of solid-state qubits, the divacancy centers in
SiC and the nitrogen-vacancy in diamond, and we report computed
photoluminescence spectra as a function of temperature that are in very good
agreement with the measured ones. As expected we find that the use of hybrid

Interestingly our calculations show that constrained density functional theory
(CDFT) and time-dependent hybrid DFT perform equally well in describing the
excited state potential energy surface of triplet states; our findings indicate
that CDFT, a relatively cheap computational approach, is sufficiently accurate
for the calculations of photoluminescence spectra of the defects studied here.
Finally, we find that only by correcting for finite-size effects and
extrapolating to the dilute limit, one can obtain a good agreement between

possible background sources that could induce precession and quantify their

universe. These simulations model various physical processes, but many of these
are included using `subgrid models' due to resolution limits. Although
different subgrid models have been successful in modelling the effects of
supernovae (SNe) feedback on galactic properties, it remains unclear if, and by
how much, these differing implementations affect observable halo gas
properties. In this work, we use `zoom-in' cosmological initial conditions of
two volumes selected to resemble the Local Group (LG) evolved with both the
Auriga and EAGLE galaxy formation models. While the subgrid physics models in
both simulations reproduce realistic stellar components of $L^\star$ galaxies,
they exhibit different gas properties. Namely, Auriga predicts that the Milky
Way (MW) is almost baryonically closed, whereas EAGLE suggests that only half
of the expected baryons reside within the halo. Furthermore, EAGLE predicts
that this baryon deficiency extends to the LG, ($r \leq 1 \mathrm{~Mpc}$). The
baryon deficiency in EAGLE is likely due to SNe feedback at high redshift,
which generates halo-wide outflows, with high covering fractions and radial
velocities, which both eject baryons and significantly impede cosmic gas
accretion. Conversely, in Auriga, gas accretion is almost unaffected by
feedback. These differences appear to be the result of the different energy
injection methods from SNe to gas. Our results suggest that both quasar
absorption lines and fast radio burst dispersion measures could constrain these
two regimes with future observations.

if the filter size of the teacher $t$ is smaller than that of the student $s$,

interaction problems involving sharp edges on structures. Four different FEM
solvers, including conventional linear and quadratic FEMs as well as their
corresponding XFEM versions with local enrichment by singular basis functions
at sharp edges, are implemented and compared. To demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of the XFEMs, a thin flat plate in an infinite fluid domain and a
forced heaving rectangle at the free surface, both in two dimensions, will be
studied. For the flat plate, the mesh convergence studies are carried out for
both the velocity potential in the fluid domain and the added mass, and the
XFEMs show apparent advantages thanks to their local enhancement at the sharp
edges. Three different enrichment strategies are also compared, and suggestions
will be made for the practical implementation of the XFEM. For the forced
heaving rectangle, the linear and 2nd order mean wave loads are studied. Our
results confirm the previous conclusion in the literature that it is not
difficult for a conventional numerical model to obtain convergent results for
added mass and damping coefficients. However, when the 2nd order mean wave
loads requiring the computation of velocity components are calculated via
direct pressure integration, it takes a tremendously large number of elements
for the conventional FEMs to get convergent results. On the contrary, the
numerical results of XFEMs converge rapidly even with very coarse meshes,

the time scales and physical conditions within these cores, a portion of these
molecules has to be brought back into the gas-phase to explain their
observation by milimeter telescopes. We tested the respective efficiencies of
the different mechanisms commonly included in the models. We also tested the
addition of sputtering of ice grain mantles via a collision with cosmic rays in
the electronic stopping power regime. The ice sputtering induced by cosmic rays
has been added to the Nautilus gas-grain model while the other processes were
already present. Each of these processes were tested on a 1D physical structure
determined by observations in TMC1 cold cores. The resulting 1D chemical
structure was also compared to methanol gas-phase abundances observed in these
cores. We found that all species are not sensitive in the same way to the
non-thermal desorption mechanisms, and the sensitivity also depends on the
physical conditions. Thus, it is mandatory to include all of them. Chemical
desorption seems to be essential in reproducing the observations for H
densities smaller than $4\times 10^4$~cm$^{-3}$, whereas sputtering is
essential above this density. The models are, however, systematically below the
observed methanol abundances. A more efficient chemical desorption and a more
efficient sputtering could better reproduce the observations. In conclusion,
the sputtering of ices by cosmic-rays collisions may be the most efficient
desorption mechanism at high density (a few $10^4$~cm$^{-3}$ under the
conditions studied here) in cold cores, whereas chemical desorption is still
required at smaller densities. Additional works are needed on both mechanisms
to assess their efficiency with respect to the main ice composition.

wavelengths from a variable or transient source in astronomy is an essential
probe of physical mechanisms causing multiwavelength variability. Time-lags are
typically quantified using discrete correlation functions (DCF) which are
appropriate for linear relationships. However, in variable sources like X-ray
binaries, active galactic nuclei (AGN) and other accreting systems, the
radiative processes and the resulting multiwavelength lightcurves often have
non-linear relationships. For such systems it is more appropriate to use
non-linear information-theoretic measures of causation like mutual information,
routinely used in other disciplines. We demonstrate with toy models loopholes
of using the standard DCF & show improvements when using the mutual information
correlation function (MICF). For non-linear correlations, the latter accurately
& sharply identifies the lag components as opposed to the DCF which can be
erroneous. Following that we apply the MICF to the multiwavelength lightcurves
of AGN NGC 4593. We find that X-ray fluxes lead UVW2 fluxes by ~0.2 days,
closer to model predictions from reprocessing by the accretion disk than the
DCF estimate. The uncertainties with the current lightcurves are too large
though to rule out -ve lags. Additionally, we find another delay component at
~-1 day i.e. UVW2 leading X-rays consistent with inward propagating
fluctuations in the accretion disk scenario. This is not detected by the DCF.
Keeping in mind the non-linear relation between X-ray & UVW2, this is worthy of
further theoretical investigation. From both toy models & real observations, it
is clear that the mutual information based estimator is highly sensitive to
complex non-linear correlations. With sufficiently high temporal resolution, we
will precisely detect each of the lag features corresponding to these
correlations.

inconsistent and less applicable. To address this issue, we extend and explore
an alternative formulation completely based on a non-inertial body-fixed
coordinate system. Unlike the traditional seakeeping models, this formulation
consistently allows for large-amplitude horizontal motions. A numerical model
based on a higher-order boundary element is applied to solve the resulting
boundary-value problems in the time domain. A recently developed new set of
explicit time-integration methods, which do not necessitate the use of upwind
schemes for spatial derivatives, are adopted to deal with the convective-type
free-surface conditions. To suppress the weak saw-tooth instabilities on the
free surface in time marching, we also present novel low-pass filters based on
optimized weighted-least-squares, which are in principle applicable for both
structured and unstructured meshes. The presented schemes for the convection
equation and the low-pass filter are also relevant for other engineering fields
dealing with similar mathematical problems. For ship seakeeping and added
resistance analyses, we show that the present computational model does not need
to use soft-springs for surge and sway, in contrast to the traditional models.

effects of large horizontal motions is demonstrated considering the

  Meta-Learning","NeurIPS 2021 (Spotlight)",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For deployment, neural architecture search should be hardware-aware, in order
to satisfy the device-specific constraints (e.g., memory usage, latency and
energy consumption) and enhance the model efficiency. Existing methods on
hardware-aware NAS collect a large number of samples (e.g., accuracy and
latency) from a target device, either builds a lookup table or a latency
estimator. However, such approach is impractical in real-world scenarios as
there exist numerous devices with different hardware specifications, and
collecting samples from such a large number of devices will require prohibitive
computational and monetary cost. To overcome such limitations, we propose
Hardware-adaptive Efficient Latency Predictor (HELP), which formulates the
device-specific latency estimation problem as a meta-learning problem, such
that we can estimate the latency of a model's performance for a given task on
an unseen device with a few samples. To this end, we introduce novel hardware
embeddings to embed any devices considering them as black-box functions that
output latencies, and meta-learn the hardware-adaptive latency predictor in a
device-dependent manner, using the hardware embeddings. We validate the
proposed HELP for its latency estimation performance on unseen platforms, on
which it achieves high estimation performance with as few as 10 measurement
samples, outperforming all relevant baselines. We also validate end-to-end NAS
frameworks using HELP against ones without it, and show that it largely reduces
the total time cost of the base NAS method, in latency-constrained settings.

polarisation of a photon is parallel transported along the photon geodesic, the
infinitesimal shape of the source, e.g. its principal axis in the case of an
ellipse, is Lie transported. As an example, we calculate the rotation of the
shape vector with respect to the polarisation direction which is generated by
lensing by a distribution of foreground Schwarzschild lenses. For radio
galaxies, the intrinsic morphological orientation of a source and its polarised
emission are correlated. It follows that observing both the polarisation and
the morphological orientation provides information on both the unlensed source
orientation and on the gravitational potential along the line of sight.

explicitly be tested on structure functions defined for any control-affine

submanifolds (ellipses, hyperbolas, and parabolas), which is treated via
feedback classification of quadratic control-nonlinear systems. Our
classification includes several normal forms of quadratic systems (in

low-complexity scheme, where users are grouped into multiple clusters operating

users' sum-rate. In this algorithm, we exploit the closed-form of optimal
intra-cluster power allocation obtained in our previous work. Then, by
transforming network-NOMA to an equivalent virtual network-OMA, we show that
the optimal power allocation can be obtained based on the very fast
water-filling algorithm. Interestingly, we observe that each NOMA cluster acts
as a virtual OMA user whose effective channel gain is obtained in closed form.
Also, each virtual OMA user requires a minimum power to satisfy the minimum
rate demand of its real multiplexed user. In simulation results, we evaluate
the performance gap between fully SC-SIC, NOMA, and OMA, in terms of users

the molecule is irreparably damaged by the subsequent fragmentation in a

that irradiated molecules may be saved from fragmentation presumably by charge
and energy dissipation mechanisms. Here, we show that the protective effect of
the environment sets in even earlier than hitherto expected, namely immediately

the fragmentation of X-ray-irradiated microsolvated pyrimidine molecules with
theoretical calculations, we identify direct intermolecular electronic decay as

can produce counterfactuals very close to the optimal one. Finally, we show how
to use counterfactual graphs to build global explanations correctly capturing

in neural vocoding. As a case study, we improve expressive speech vocoding with
a revamped Parallel Wavenet (PW). Specifically, we propose to extend the affine
transformation of PW to the more expressive invertible non-affine function. The
greater expressiveness of the improved PW leads to better-perceived signal
quality and naturalness in the waveform reconstruction and text-to-speech (TTS)
tasks. We evaluate the model across different speaking styles on a
multi-speaker, multi-lingual dataset. In the waveform reconstruction task, the
proposed model closes the naturalness and signal quality gap from the original
PW to recordings by $10\%$, and from other state-of-the-art neural vocoding
systems by more than $60\%$. We also demonstrate improvements in objective
metrics on the evaluation test set with L2 Spectral Distance and Cross-Entropy
reduced by $3\%$ and $6\unicode{x2030}$ comparing to the affine PW.
Furthermore, we extend the probability density distillation procedure proposed
by the original PW paper, so that it works with any non-affine invertible and
differentiable function.

representative of topological quantum matter. Its well-known representative,
the quasi-one-dimensional SrNi$_2$V$_2$O$_8$ shows both conventional as well as
unconventional magnetic Raman scattering. The former is observed as one- and
two-triplet excitations with small linewidths and energies corresponding to the
Haldane gap $\Delta_H$ and the exchange coupling $J_c$ along the chain,
respectively. Well-defined magnetic quasiparticles are assumed to be stabilized
by interchain interactions and uniaxial single-ion anisotropy. Unconventional
scattering exists as broad continua of scattering with an intensity $I(T)$ that
shows a mixed bosonic / fermionic statistic. Such a mixed statistic has also
been observed in Kitaev spin liquids and could point to a non-Abelian symmetry.
As the ground state in the bulk of SrNi$_2$V$_2$O$_8$ is topologically trivial,
we suggest its fractionalization to be due to light-induced interchain exchange
processes. These processes are supposed to be enhanced due to a proximity to an
Ising ordered state with a quantum critical point. A comparison with
SrCo$_2$V$_2$O$_8$, the $S=1/2$ analogue to our title compound, supports these
statements.

a taxonomy is that it only considers the case of network steganography.
  Therefore, this paper reviews both the terminology and the taxonomy of hiding

into those that describe the embedding and the representation of hidden data

  of an advantageous gene",,,,,"math.PR math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we investigate the spread of advantageous genes in two variants
of the F-KPP model with dormancy. The first variant, in which dormant
individuals do not move in space and instead form ""localized seed banks"", has
recently been introduced in Blath, Hammer and Nie (2020). However, there, only
a relatively crude upper bound for the critical speed of potential travelling
wave solutions has been provided. The second model variant is new and describes
a situation in which the dormant forms of individuals are subject to motion,
while the ""active"" individuals remain spatially static instead. This can be
motivated e.g. by spore dispersal of fungi, where the ""dormant"" spores are
distributed by wind, water or insects, while the ""active"" fungi are locally
fixed. For both models, we establish the existence of monotone travelling wave
solutions, determine the corresponding critical wave-speed in terms of the
model parameters, and characterize aspects of the asymptotic shape of the waves
depending on the decay properties of the initial condition. Interestingly, the
slow-down effect of dormancy on the speed of propagation of beneficial alleles
is often more serious in model variant II (the ""spore model"") than in variant I
(the ""seed bank model""), and this can be understood mathematically via
probabilistic representations of solutions in terms of (two variants of)
""on/off branching Brownian motions"". Our proofs make rather heavy use of
probabilistic tools in the tradition of McKean (1975), Bramson (1978), Neveu
(1987), Lalley and Sellke (1987), Champneys et al (1995) and others. However,
the two-compartment nature of the model and the special forms of dormancy also
pose obstacles to the classical formalism, giving rise to a variety of open
research questions that we briefly discuss at the end of the paper.

document as input, while a subset of the sentences in the document, noted as
the evidence, are often sufficient for humans to predict the relation of an
entity pair. In this paper, we propose an evidence-enhanced framework, Eider,
that empowers DocRE by efficiently extracting evidence and effectively fusing
the extracted evidence in inference. We first jointly train an RE model with a
lightweight evidence extraction model, which is efficient in both memory and
runtime. Empirically, even training the evidence model on silver labels
constructed by our heuristic rules can lead to better RE performance. We
further design a simple yet effective inference process that makes RE
predictions on both extracted evidence and the full document, then fuses the
predictions through a blending layer. This allows Eider to focus on important
sentences while still having access to the complete information in the
document. Extensive experiments show that Eider outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on three benchmark datasets (e.g., by 1.37/1.26 Ign F1/F1 on DocRED).

every component base classifier's performance and dissimilarity between each
pair of component classifiers are evaluated by the same metric - the Euclidean
distance. Consequently, ensembling becomes a deterministic problem and the
performance of an ensemble can be calculated directly by a formula. We prove
several theorems of interest and explain their implications for ensembles. In
particular, we compare and contrast the effect of the number of component
classifiers on these two types of ensemble schemes. Empirical investigation is
also conducted to verify the theoretical results when other metrics such as
accuracy are used. We believe that the results from this paper are very useful
for us to understand the fundamental properties of these two combination
schemes and the principles of ensemble classifiers in general. The results are
also helpful for us to investigate some issues in ensemble classifiers, such as
ensemble performance prediction, selecting a small number of base classifiers

rules the build-up of the reactive helicity through its zero time-average flow.
Its imaginary Poynting momentum accounts for the accretion of reactive power,
are illustrated in: evanescent waves and fields scattered from
magnetodielectric dipolar nanoparticles. As for the former, we show that its
reactive helicity may be experimentally observed as we introduce a reactive
spin momentum and a reactive orbital momentum in terms of which we express the
imaginary field momentum, whose transversal component produces an optical force
on a magnetoelectric particle that, as we illustrate, may surpass and can be
discriminated from, the known force due to the so-called extraordinary
momentum. We also uncover a non-conservative force on such a magnetoelectric
particle, acting in the decay direction of the evanescent wave, and that may
also be discriminated from the standard gradient force; thus making the
reactive power of the wavefield also observable. Concerning the light scattered
by magnetoelectric nanoparticles, we establish two optical theorems that govern
the accretion of reactive helicity and reactive power on extinction of incident
wave helicity and energy. Like a nule total -- internal plus external --
reactive power is at the root of a resonant scattered power, we show that a
zero total reactive helicity underlies a resonant scattered helicity. The first
Kerker condition, under which the particle becomes dual on illumination with
circularly polarized light, we demonstrate to amount to a nule overall
scattered reactive helicity. and emission. We discover a discriminatory
property of the reactive helicity of chiral light incident on a chiral
nanoparticle by excitation of the external reactive power. This for optical
near-field enantiomeric separation, we call reactive dichroism.

extends DCCRN with the following significant revisions. We first extend the

neural network filters instead of engineered FIR filters, leading to a faster
noise suppressor trained in an end-to-end manner. Then the LSTM is further
substituted with a complex TF-LSTM to better model temporal dependencies along

output of each encoder layer to the input of the corresponding decoder layer,
we use convolution blocks to first aggregate essential information from the
encoder output before feeding it to the decoder layers. We specifically
formulate the decoder with an extra a priori SNR estimation module to maintain
good speech quality while removing noise. Finally a post-processing module is
adopted to further suppress the unnatural residual noise. The new model, named
DCCRN+, has surpassed the original DCCRN as well as several competitive models

or present) in A is independent of the state of edges in B. For an infinite

$p_{1,c}(H)$ is the infimum of the p in [0,1] such that every 1-independent
random graph model on H in which each edge is present with probability at least
p almost surely contains an infinite connected component.
  Balister and Bollob\'as observed in 2012 that $p_{1,c}(\mathbb{Z}^d)$ is
nonincreasing and tends to a limit in [1/2, 1] as d tends to infinity. They
asked for the value of this limit. We make progress towards this question by
showing that \[\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}p_{1,c}(\mathbb{Z}^2\times

remains true if the sequence of complete graphs $K_n$ is replaced by a sequence
of weakly pseudorandom graphs on n vertices with average degree $\omega(\log

instead by the n-dimensional hypercube $Q_n$. This latter conjecture would
imply the answer to Balister and Bollob\'as's question is $4-2\sqrt{3}$.

quantum-classical feedback loop. A classical device is used to optimize the
parameters in order to minimize a cost function that can be computed far more
efficiently on a quantum device. The cost function is constructed such that
finding the ansatz parameters that minimize its value, solves some problem of
interest. We focus specifically on the Variational Quantum Linear Solver
(VQLS), and examine the effect of several gradient-free and gradient-based
classical optimizers on performance. We focus on both the average rate of
convergence of the classical optimizers studied, as well as the distribution of
their average termination cost values, and how these are affected by noise. Our
work demonstrates that realistic noise levels on NISQ devices present a
challenge to the optimization process. All classical optimizers appear to be
very negatively affected by the presence of realistic noise. If noise levels
are significantly improved, there may be a good reason for preferring
gradient-based methods in the future, which performed better than the
gradient-free methods with the only shot-noise present. The gradient-free
optimizers, Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) and
Powell's method, and the gradient-based optimizers, AMSGrad and BFGS performed
the best in the noisy simulation, and appear to be less affected by noise than
the rest of the methods. SPSA appears to be the best performing method. COBYLA,
Nelder-Mead and Conjugate-Gradient methods appear to be the most heavily
affected by noise, with even slight noise levels significantly impacting their

two tasks: word discrimination and phonological similarity. Our experiments
show that (1) the distance in the embedding space in the best cases only

approximate Bayesian computation with sequential Monte Carlo sampling and (b)
genetic algorithm -- and use the overall resulting method to reconstruct the
cosmic chronometers and supernovae type Ia data sets. The results have shown
that the Mat\'{e}rn$\left( \nu = 5/2 \right)$ kernel emerges on top of the
two-hyperparameter family of kernels for both cosmological data sets. On the
other hand, we use the genetic algorithm in order to select a most
naturally-fit kernel among a competitive pool made up of a ten-hyperparameters
class of kernels. Imposing a Bayesian information criterion-inspired measure of
the fitness, the results have shown that a hybrid of the Radial Basis Function
and the Mat\'{e}rn$\left( \nu = 5/2 \right)$ kernel best represented both data
sets. The kernel selection problem is not totally closed and may benefit from
further analysis using other strategies to resolve an optimal kernel for a
particular data set.

for partitioning the vertices into $k$ disjoint blocks of bounded size while
minimizing an objective function over the hyperedges. Here, we consider the
most commonly used connectivity metric. We describe our open source hypergraph
partitioner KaHyPar which is based on the successful multi-level approach --
driving it to the extreme of one level for (almost) every vertex. Using
carefully designed data structures and dynamic update techniques, this approach
offers a very good time-quality tradeoff. We present two preprocessing
techniques -- pin sparsification using locality sensitive hashing and community
detection based on the Louvain algorithm. The community structure is used to
guide the coarsening process that incrementally contracts vertices.
Portfolio-based partitioning of the contracted hypergraph already achieves good
initial solutions. While reversing the contractions, a combination of
highly-localized direct $k$-way local search and flow-based techniques that
take a more global view, refine the partition to achieve high quality.
Optionally, a memetic algorithm evolves a pool of solution candidates to obtain
even higher quality.
  We evaluate KaHyPar on a large set of instances from a wide range of
application domains. With respect to quality, KaHyPar outperforms all
previously considered systems that can handle large hypergraphs such as hMETIS,
PaToH, Mondriaan, or Zoltan. KaHyPar is also faster than most of these systems
except for PaToH which represents a different speed-quality tradeoff. The
results even extend to the special case of graph partitioning, where
specialized systems such as KaHIP should have an advantage.

knowledge of individual representation point-wise and thus have a limitation in
that primary information of RS lies in the relations in the representation
space. This paper proposes a new topology distillation approach that guides the
student by transferring the topological structure built upon the relations in
the teacher space. We first observe that simply making the student learn the
whole topological structure is not always effective and even degrades the
student's performance. We demonstrate that because the capacity of the student
is highly limited compared to that of the teacher, learning the whole
topological structure is daunting for the student. To address this issue, we
propose a novel method named Hierarchical Topology Distillation (HTD) which
distills the topology hierarchically to cope with the large capacity gap. Our
extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed method

intuitively, the dynamics becomes sub-diffusive and the relaxation modes become
over-damped. For a finite system, spontaneous delocalization may arise, due to
residual bias that is induced by the irradiation.

know which factors influence or associate with citation impact of articles.
Several citation factors have been studied in the literature. In this study we
propose a new factor, topic growth, that no previous study has studied
empirically. The growth rate of topics may influence future citation counts
because a high growth in a topic means there are more publications citing
previous publications in that topic. We construct topics using community
detection in a citation network and use a two-part regression model to study
the association between topic growth and citation counts in eight broad
disciplines. The first part of the model uses quantile regression to estimate
the effect of growth ratio on citation counts for publications with more than
three citations. The second part of the model uses logistic regression to model
the influence of the explanatory variables on the probability of being lowly
cited versus being modestly or highly cited. Both models control for three
variables that may distort the association between the topic growth and
citations: journal impact, number of references, and number of authors. The
regression model clearly shows that publications in fast-growing topics have a
citation advantage compared to publications in slow-growing or declining topics
in all of the eight disciplines. Using citation indicators for research
evaluation may give incentives for researchers to publish in fast-growing
topics, but they may cause research to be less diversified. The results have
also some implications for citation normalization.

infrastructures with fairness and universality being the primary outcomes of
the NN management practice. For networks, the accomplishment of NN management
practice is essential to deal with heterogeneous user requirements and the
ever-increasing data traffic. Current tools and methods address the NN problem
by detecting network neutrality violations and detecting traffic
differentiation. This paper proposes the NN-PCM (Network Neutrality Policy
Conformance Module) that deploys the BEREC network neutrality policy using a
bandwidth allocation model (BAM). The NN-PCM new approach allocates bandwidth
to network users and accomplishes the BEREC NN policy concomitantly. Network
neutrality is achieved by grouping users with similar traffic requirements in
classes and leveraging the bandwidth allocation model's characteristics. The
conceptual analysis and simulation results indicate that NN-PCM allocates
bandwidth to users and accomplishes BEREC network neutrality conformance by
design with transparent, non-discriminatory, exceptional, and proportional
management practices.

for the analysis of gravitational waves from merging compact objects.
Bilby-MCMC provides a parallel-tempered ensemble Metropolis-Hastings sampler
with access to a block-updating proposal library including problem-specific and
machine learning proposals. We demonstrate that learning proposals can produce
over a 10-fold improvement in efficiency by reducing the autocorrelation time.
Using a variety of standard and problem-specific tests, we validate the ability
of the Bilby-MCMC sampler to produce independent posterior samples and estimate
the Bayesian evidence. Compared to the widely-used dynesty nested sampling
algorithm, Bilby-MCMC is less efficient in producing independent posterior
samples and less accurate in its estimation of the evidence. However, we find
that posterior samples drawn from the Bilby-MCMC sampler are more robust: never
failing to pass our validation tests. Meanwhile, the dynesty sampler fails the
difficult-to-sample Rosenbrock likelihood test, over constraining the
posterior. For CBC problems, this highlights the importance of cross-sampler
comparisons to ensure results are robust to sampling error. Finally, Bilby-MCMC
can be embarrassingly and asynchronously parallelised making it highly suitable
for reducing the analysis wall-time using a High Throughput Computing
environment. Bilby-MCMC may be a useful tool for the rapid and robust analysis
of gravitational-wave signals during the advanced detector era and we expect it
to have utility throughout astrophysics.

significant portion of their final mass through episodes of very rapid
accretion, with mass accretion rates up to $\dot M_* \sim 10^{-4}

(HMYSO) with masses $M_* \gtrsim 10 M_{\odot}$ uncovered outbursts with
accretion rates exceeding $\dot M_*\sim 10^{-3}M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$. Here we
examine which scenarios proposed in the literature so far to explain accretion
bursts of LMYSOs can apply to the episodic accretion in HMYSOs. We utilise a 1D
time dependent models of protoplanetary discs around HMYSOs to study burst
properties. We find that discs around HMYSOs are much hotter than those around
their low mass cousins. As a result, much more extended regions of the disc are
prone to the thermal hydrogen ionisation and MRI activation instabilities. The
former in particular is found to be ubiquitous in a very wide range of
accretion rates and disc viscosity parameters. The outbursts triggered by these
instabilities, however, always have too low $\dot M_*$, and are one to several
orders of magnitude too long compared to those observed from HMYSOs so far. On
the other hand, bursts generated by tidal disruptions of gaseous giant planets
formed by the gravitational instability of the protoplanetary discs yield
properties commensurate with observations, provided that the clumps are in the
post-collapse configuration with planet radius $R_{\rm p} \gtrsim 10 $ Jupiter
radii. Furthermore, if observed bursts are caused by disc ionisation
instabilities then they should be periodic phenomena with the duration of the
quiescent phase comparable to that of the bursts. This may yield potentially
observable burst periodicity signatures in the jets, the outer disc, or the
surrounding diffuse material of massive HMYSOs. (abridged)

there are still limitations of transferring source style to the converted

recognition-synthesis framework. Previously in speech generation task, prosody
can be modeled explicitly with prosodic features or implicitly with a latent
prosody extractor. In this paper, taking advantages of both, we model the
prosody in a hybrid manner, which effectively combines explicit and implicit
methods in a proposed prosody module. Specifically, prosodic features are used
to explicit model prosody, while VAE and reference encoder are used to
implicitly model prosody, which take Mel spectrum and bottleneck feature as
input respectively. Furthermore, adversarial training is introduced to remove
speaker-related information from the VAE outputs, avoiding leaking source
speaker information while transferring style. Finally, we use a modified
self-attention based encoder to extract sentential context from bottleneck
features, which also implicitly aggregates the prosodic aspects of source
speech from the layered representations. Experiments show that our approach is
superior to the baseline and a competitive system in terms of style transfer;
meanwhile, the speech quality and speaker similarity are well maintained.

Gradient Clipped-Gradient Penality (GCGP), where we clip and penalise the
gradients. In contrast, the second one is based on the relationship of the
invex function to the composition of invertible and convex functions. We employ
connectedness as a basic interpretation method and create connected
region-based classifiers. We show that multiple connected set based classifiers
can approximate any classification function. In the experiments section, we use
our methods for classification tasks using an ensemble of 1-vs-all models as
well as using a single multiclass model on larger-scale datasets. The
experiments show that connected set-based classifiers do not pose any
disadvantage over ordinary neural network classifiers, but rather, enhance
their interpretability. We also did an extensive study on the properties of
invex function and connected sets for interpretability and network morphism
with experiments on simulated and real-world data sets. Our study suggests that
invex function is fundamental to understanding and applying locality and
connectedness of input space which is useful for various downstream tasks.

forensics such as malicious personation and digital copyright infringement,
which promotes works on fake image attribution. Existing works on fake image
attribution mainly rely on a direct classification framework. Without
additional supervision, the extracted features could include many
content-relevant components and generalize poorly. Meanwhile, how to obtain an
interpretable GAN fingerprint to explain the decision remains an open question.
Adopting a multi-task framework, we propose a GAN Fingerprint Disentangling
Network (GFD-Net) to simultaneously disentangle the fingerprint from
GAN-generated images and produce a content-irrelevant representation for fake
image attribution. A series of constraints are provided to guarantee the
stability and discriminability of the fingerprint, which in turn helps
content-irrelevant feature extraction. Further, we perform comprehensive
analysis on GAN fingerprint, providing some clues about the properties of GAN
fingerprint and which factors dominate the fingerprint in GAN architecture.
Experiments show that our GFD-Net achieves superior fake image attribution
performance in both closed-world and open-world testing. We also apply our
method in binary fake image detection and exhibit a significant generalization
ability on unseen generators.

  Cardiac Segmentation","accepted by IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Unsupervised domain adaptation is useful in medical image segmentation.
Particularly, when ground truths of the target images are not available, domain
adaptation can train a target-specific model by utilizing the existing labeled
images from other modalities. Most of the reported works mapped images of both
the source and target domains into a common latent feature space, and then
reduced their discrepancy either implicitly with adversarial training or
explicitly by directly minimizing a discrepancy metric. In this work, we
propose a new framework, where the latent features of both domains are driven
towards a common and parameterized variational form, whose conditional
distribution given the image is Gaussian. This is achieved by two networks
based on variational auto-encoders (VAEs) and a regularization for this
variational approximation. Both of the VAEs, each for one domain, contain a
segmentation module, where the source segmentation is trained in a supervised
manner, while the target one is trained unsupervisedly. We validated the
proposed domain adaptation method using two cardiac segmentation tasks, i.e.,
the cross-modality (CT and MR) whole heart segmentation and the cross-sequence
cardiac MR segmentation. Results show that the proposed method achieved better
accuracies compared to two state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrated good
potential for cardiac segmentation. Furthermore, the proposed explicit
regularization was shown to be effective and efficient in narrowing down the
distribution gap between domains, which is useful for unsupervised domain
adaptation. Our code and data has been released via

these systems with the domains separated by a width w have a bare (current)

a magnetic field does not induce chiral symmetry breaking between the separated

strong enough to introduce spontaneous symmetry breaking. We show a

final-state anisotropic flow $v_n$ are linearly related to the strength of the
multi-pole shape of the distribution of nucleons in the transverse plane
$\varepsilon_n$, $v_n\propto \varepsilon_n$. The $\varepsilon_n$, for
$n=1,2,3,4$, are sensitive to the shape of the colliding ions, characterized by
the quadrupole $\beta_2$, octupole $\beta_3$ and hexadecapole $\beta_4$
deformations. This sensitivity is investigated analytically and also in a Monte
Carlo Glauber model. One observes a robust linear relation,
$\langle\varepsilon_n^2\rangle = a_n'+b_n'\beta_n^2$, for events in a fixed
centrality. The $\langle\varepsilon_1^2\rangle$ has a contribution from
$\beta_3$ and $\beta_4$, and $\langle\varepsilon_3^2\rangle$ from $\beta_4$. In
the ultra-central collisions, there are little cross contributions between
$\beta_2$ and $\varepsilon_3$ and between $\beta_3$ and $\varepsilon_2$, but
clear cross contributions are present in non-central collisions. Additionally,
$\langle\varepsilon_n^2\rangle$ are insensitive to non-axial shape parameters
such as the triaxiality. This is good news because the measurements of $v_2$,
$v_3$ and $v_4$ can be used to constrain simultaneously the $\beta_2$,
$\beta_3$, and $\beta_4$ values. This is best done by comparing two colliding
ions with similar mass numbers and therefore nearly identical $a_n'$, to obtain
simple equation that relates the $\beta_n$ of the two species. This opens up
the possibility to map the shape of the atomic nuclei at a timescale
($<10^{-24}$s) much shorter than probed by low-energy nuclear structure physics
($<10^{-21}$s), which ultimately may provide information complementary to those
obtained in the nuclear structure experiments.

linear in the number of bandits. We further show that this linear runtime

superior performance of neural networks in solving challenging problems with

neural networks to approximate value functions by minimising the Mean Squared
Bellman Error (MSBE) function. Despite great successes of DRL, development of
reliable and efficient numerical algorithms to minimise the MSBE is still of
great scientific interest and practical demand. Such a challenge is partially
due to the underlying optimisation problem being highly non-convex or using
incomplete gradient information as done in Semi-Gradient algorithms. In this
work, we analyse the MSBE from a smooth optimisation perspective and develop an
efficient Approximate Newton's algorithm.
  First, we conduct a critical point analysis of the error function and provide
technical insights on optimisation and design choices for neural networks. When
the existence of global minima is assumed and the objective fulfils certain
conditions, suboptimal local minima can be avoided when using over-parametrised
neural networks. We construct a Gauss Newton Residual Gradient algorithm based
on the analysis in two variations. The first variation applies to discrete
state spaces and exact learning. We confirm theoretical properties of this
algorithm such as being locally quadratically convergent to a global minimum
numerically. The second employs sampling and can be used in the continuous
setting. We demonstrate feasibility and generalisation capabilities of the
proposed algorithm empirically using continuous control problems and provide a
numerical verification of our critical point analysis. We outline the
difficulties of combining Semi-Gradient approaches with Hessian information. To
benefit from second-order information complete derivatives of the MSBE must be

ARs, around the times of large flares. In particular, we are interested in a
possible relation of the derived quantities to the particular type of the
flares that the AR produces, i.e., whether they are associated with a CME or
they are confined. Using an optimization approach, we employ time series of 3D
nonlinear force-free magnetic field models of ten ARs, covering a time span of
several hours around the time of occurrence of large solar flares (GOES class
M1.0 and larger). We subsequently compute the 3D magnetic vector potentials
associated to the model 3D coronal magnetic field using a finite-volume method.
This allows us to correspondingly compute the coronal magnetic energy and
helicity budgets, as well as related (intensive) quantities such as the
relative contribution of free magnetic energy, $E_{\mathrm{F}}/{E}$ (energy
ratio), the fraction of non-potential (current-carrying) helicity,
$|H_{\mathrm{J}}|/|{H_{V}}|$ (helicity ratio), and the normalized
current-carrying helicity, $|H_{\mathrm{J}}|/{\phi^{\prime}}^{2}$. The total
energy and helicity budgets of flare-productive ARs (extensive parameters)
cover a broad range of magnitudes, with no obvious relation to the eruptive
potential of the individual ARs, i.e., whether or not a CME is produced in
association with the flare. The intensive eruptivity proxies,
$E_{\mathrm{F}}/{E}$ and $|H_{\mathrm{J}}|/|{H_{V}}|$, and
$|H_{\mathrm{J}}|/{\phi^{\prime}}^{2}$, however, seem to be distinctly
different for ARs that produced CME-associated large flares compared to those
which produced confined flares. For the majority of ARs in our sample, we are
able to identify characteristic pre-flare magnitudes of the intensive
quantities, clearly associated to subsequent CME-productivity.

in the COSMOS and XXL-S radio surveys at 3 GHz and 2.1 GHz, respectively. This
sample was identified by adopting a conservative threshold in X-ray luminosity,
Lx [2-10\ keV] >= 10^44 erg/s, selecting only the most powerful quasars. Using
available multiwavelength data, we examined various criteria for the selection
of radio-loud (RL) and radio-quiet (RQ) XQSOs, finding that the number of RL/RQ
XQSOs changes significantly depending on the chosen criterion. This discrepancy
arises due to the different criteria tracing different physical processes and
due to our sample being selected from flux-limited radio and X-ray surveys.
Another approach to study the origin of radio emission in XQSOs is via their
radio luminosity function (RLF). We constructed the XQSO 1.4 GHz radio
luminosity functions (RLFs) in six redshift bins at 0.5 <= z <= 3.7. The
lower-1.4 GHz luminosity end shows a higher normalization than expected only
from AGN contribution in all studied redshift bins. The found ""bump"" is mostly
dominated by emission due to star-forming (SF) processes within the XQSO host
galaxies. As expected, AGN-related radio emission dominates at the
higher-luminosity end of RLF. The evolution of XQSO RLF was studied via
combination of analytic forms from the literature to constrain the
lower-luminosity ""bump"" and the higher-luminosity AGN part of the RLF. We
defined two 1.4 GHz luminosity thresholds, L_th,SF and L_th,AGN, below and
above which more than 80% of sources contributing to the RLF are dominated by
SF and AGN-related activity, respectively. These thresholds evolve with
redshift, most likely due to the strong evolution of SFRs of the XQSO host
galaxies.

quotients, parameterized by a parameter $\alpha\in [g,G]$, where
$g=\tfrac{1}{2}(\sqrt{5}-1)$ and $G=g+1=1/g$ are the two golden mean numbers is
introduced. In this article, by using operations called singularizations and
insertions on the partial quotients of the odd continued fraction expansions
under consideration, the natural extensions from [BM] are obtained, and it is
shown that for each $\alpha,\alpha^*\in [g,G]$ the natural extensions from [BM]
are metrically isomorphic. An immediate consequence of this is, that the
entropy of all these natural extensions is equal for $\alpha\in [g,G]$, a fact
already observed in [BM]. Furthermore, it is shown that this approach can be
extended to values of $\alpha$ smaller than $g$, and that for values of $\alpha
\in [\tfrac{1}{6}(\sqrt{13}-1), g]$ all natural extensions are still
isomorphic. In the final section of this paper further attention is given to
the entropy, as function of $\alpha\in [0,G]$. It is shown that in any
neighborhood of $0$ we can find intervals on which the entropy is decreasing,
intervals on which the entropy is increasing and intervals on which the entropy
is constant. In order to prove this we use a phenomena called matching.

super-Eddington accretion, which drives fast mass outflow (disk wind). So here
we explore a possible scenario that such a flare might be produced by the
interaction of the disk wind with a dusty torus for TDEs in AGN. Due to the
high velocity of the disk wind, strong shocks will emerge and convert the bulk
of the kinetic energy of the disk wind to radiation. We calculate the dynamics
and then predict the associated radiation signatures, taking into account the
widths of the wind and torus. We compare our model with the bolometric light
curve of the late flare in PS1-10adi constructed from observations. We find
from our modeling that the disk wind has a total kinetic energy of about
$10^{51}$ erg and a velocity of 0.1 c (i.e., a mass of 0.3 $M_{\odot}$); the
gas number density of the clouds in the torus is $3\times 10^{7}$ $\rm

performance efficiency for error-resilient application. Recent approximate
adders have significantly extended the design space of accuracy-power
configurable approximate adders, and find optimal designs by exploring the
design space. In this paper, a new energy-efficient heterogeneous block-based
approximate adder (HBBA) is proposed; which is a generic/configurable model
that can be transformed to a particular adder by defining some configurations.
An HBBA, in general, is composed of heterogeneous sub-adders, where each
sub-adder can have a different configuration. A set of configurations of all
the sub-adders in an HBBA defines its configuration. The block-based adders are
approximated through inexact logic configuration and truncated carry chains.
HBBA increases design space providing additional design points that fall on the
Pareto-front and offer better power-accuracy trade-off compared to other
configurations. Furthermore, to avoid Mont-Carlo simulations, we propose an
analytical modelling technique to evaluate the probability of error and
Probability Mass Function (PMF) of error value. Moreover, the estimation method
estimates delay, area and power of heterogeneous block-based approximate
adders. Thus, based on the analytical model and estimation method, the optimal
configuration under a given error constraint can be selected from the whole
design space of the proposed adder model by exhaustive search. The simulation
results show that our HBBA provides improved accuracy in terms of error metrics
compared to some state-of-the-art approximate adders. HBBA with 32 bits length
serves about 15% reduction in area and up to 17% reduction in energy compared
to state-of-the-art approximate adders.

analysing spectra obtained from spectrophotometric standard stars and
narrow-band emitter planetary nebulae. Thanks to their additional optical

better focused spectra within the full visible wavelength domain

investigate this phenomenon by analyzing electron energy-loss spectroscopy

the applied magnetic field within a relatively modest sub-tesla regime. The
magnetic field modifies the optical field distribution of the sampled

Nonetheless, this method does not take advantage of available meta-data, such

continuous proxy metadata, in the contrastive learning framework, by
introducing a new loss called y-Aware InfoNCE loss. Specifically, we improve
the positive sampling during pre-training by adding more positive examples with
similar proxy meta-data with the anchor, assuming they share similar
discriminative semantic features.With our method, a 3D CNN model pre-trained on
$10^4$ multi-site healthy brain MRI scans can extract relevant features for
three classification tasks: schizophrenia, bipolar diagnosis and Alzheimer's

these tasks, as well as state-of-the-art self-supervised methods. Our code is

Hence, a joint user association and scheduling problem in FL over wireless

often regulated to be fair, in the sense that the predicted target should
satisfy some quantitative notion of parity with respect to a protected
attribute. However, the exact tradeoff between fairness and accuracy with a
real-valued target is not entirely clear. In this paper, we characterize the
inherent tradeoff between statistical parity and accuracy in the regression
setting by providing a lower bound on the error of any fair regressor. Our
lower bound is sharp, algorithm-independent, and admits a simple
interpretation: when the moments of the target differ between groups, any fair
algorithm has to make an error on at least one of the groups. We further extend
this result to give a lower bound on the joint error of any (approximately)
fair algorithm, using the Wasserstein distance to measure the quality of the
approximation. With our novel lower bound, we also show that the price paid by
a fair regressor that does not take the protected attribute as input is less
than that of a fair regressor with explicit access to the protected attribute.
On the upside, we establish the first connection between individual fairness,
accuracy parity, and the Wasserstein distance by showing that if a regressor is
individually fair, it also approximately verifies the accuracy parity, where
the gap is given by the Wasserstein distance between the two groups. Inspired
by our theoretical results, we develop a practical algorithm for fair
regression through the lens of representation learning, and conduct experiments
on a real-world dataset to corroborate our findings.

By virtue of the attention mechanism, we conduct a special attentional
aggregation network (AAN) consisting of self-AAN and cross-AAN for raising the
representation ability of features eventually. The former AAN aggregates and
models the self-semantic interdependencies of the single feature map via
spatial and channel dimensions. The latter aims to aggregate the
cross-interdependencies of two different semantic features including the
location information of anchors. In addition, the anchor proposal network based
on dual features is proposed to raise its robustness of tracking objects with
various scales. Experiments on two well-known authoritative benchmarks are
conducted, where SiamAPN++ outperforms its baseline SiamAPN and other SOTA

significantly modifies the orbital trajectories of the objects, with respect to
orbit integration in static Milky Way-only potentials, and leads to 6 galaxies

nematicity alone can drive unconventional superconductivity or anomalous

isolation, providing a unique opportunity to address this question. Studies to
date, however, have proved inconclusive; while signatures of nematic
criticality are observed upon sulfur substitution, they appear to be quenched
under the application of pressure due to the emergent magnetism. Here, we study
the temperature and pressure dependence of the low-temperature resistivity of
FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$ crystals at $x$ values just beyond the nematic quantum
critical point. Two distinct components to the resistivity are revealed; one
whose magnitude falls with increasing pressure and one which grows upon
approaching the magnetic state at higher pressures. These findings indicate
that nematic and magnetic critical fluctuations in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$ are
completely decoupled, in marked contrast to other Fe-based superconductors, and
that nematic fluctuations alone may be responsible for the transport signatures
of quantum criticality found in FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$ at ambient pressure.

self-attention, which comes at a computational cost quadratic in the input

attention scores computed using this dot product mechanism on a typical

Through eigen analysis of full attention score matrices, as well as of their

these eigenspaces for different layers and even different transformer models.
Based on this, we propose to compute scores only for a partial subset of token

investigating the accuracy of reconstructing attention scores themselves, we
investigate training transformer models that employ these approximations, and
analyze the effect on overall accuracy. Our analysis and the proposed method

mission planning. The problem is to plan a path for one, or more, agents to
reach a target without being detected by enemy sensors.
  Agents are not passive, rather they can initiate actions which aid evasion.
They can knockout sensors. Here to knockout a sensor means to completely
disable the sensor. They can also confuse sensors. Here to confuse a sensor
means to reduce the probability that the sensor can detect an agent.
  Agent actions are path dependent and time limited. By path dependent we mean
that an agent needs to be sufficiently close to a sensor to knock it out. By
time limited we mean that a limit is imposed on how long a sensor is knocked
out or confused before it reverts back to its original operating state.
  The approach adopted breaks the continuous space in which agents move into a
discrete space. This enables the problem to be formulated as a zero-one integer
program with linear constraints. The advantage of representing the problem in
this manner is that powerful commercial software optimisation packages exist to
solve the problem to proven global optimality. A heuristic for the problem
based on successive shortest paths is also presented.

However, learning to recognise human actions and their social interactions in

potentially highly unbalanced and long-tailed distributed action labels from a
stream of sensory data captured from a mobile robot platform remains a
significant challenge, not least owing to the lack of a reflective large-scale

JRDB, which is captured by a social mobile manipulator and reflects a real
distribution of human daily-life actions in a university campus environment.
JRDB-Act has been densely annotated with atomic actions, comprises over 2.8M
action labels, constituting a large-scale spatio-temporal action detection
dataset. Each human bounding box is labeled with one pose-based action label
and multiple~(optional) interaction-based action labels. Moreover JRDB-Act
provides social group annotation, conducive to the task of grouping individuals
based on their interactions in the scene to infer their social

JRDB-Act is tagged with the annotators' confidence level which contributes to
the development of reliable evaluation strategies. In order to demonstrate how
one can effectively utilise such annotations, we develop an end-to-end
trainable pipeline to learn and infer these tasks, i.e. individual action and
social group detection. The data and the evaluation code is publicly available

holes (SMBHs) at the center of galaxies. After the disruption of a star by a
SMBH, the highly elliptical orbit of the debris stream will be gradually
circularized due to the self-crossing, and then the circularized debris will
form an accretion disk. The recent TDE candidate AT 2019avd has double peaks in
its optical light curve, and the X-ray emerges near the second peak. The
durations of the peaks are ~400 and 600 days, respectively, and the separation
between them is ~700 days. We fit its spectral energy distribution (SED) and
analyze its light curves in the optical/UV, mid-infrared, and X-ray bands. We
find that this source can be interpreted as a two-phase scenario in which the
first phase is dominated by the stream circularization, and the second phase is
the delayed accretion. We use the succession of the self-crossing model and the
delayed accretion model to fit the first and the second peaks, respectively.
The fitting result implies that AT 2019avd can be interpreted by the partial
disruption of a 0.9 M_sun star by a 7 * 10^6 M_sun SMBH, but this result is
sensitive to the stellar model. Furthermore, we find the large-amplitude (by

temperature-gradient in such setups. A suite of 3D simulations were conducted
using a numerical hydrodynamic code. We used as a simplified test case, a
sample region of the secondary atmosphere of a hot rocky exoplanet within which
the chemical transition CO+O $\leftrightarrow$ CO$_{2}$ could occur. Newtonian
cooling and a chemical source term was used to maintain a negative mean
molecular weight gradient. Our results demonstrate that this setup can reduce
the temperature gradient, a result which does not converge away with resolution
or over time. We also show that the presence of the reduced temperature
gradient is a function of the forcing timescales. The above transition leads to
a bifurcation of the temperature profile when the chemical forcing is fast,
reminiscent of the bifurcation seen in the boiling crisis for steam/liquid
convection. With the reduced temperature gradient in these idealized setups,
there exists the possibility for an analogy of the reddening (currently
observed in the spectra of brown dwarfs) in the spectra of rocky exoplanet
atmospheres. Detailed 1D modelling is needed, in order to characterize the
equilibrium thermal and compositional gradients, the timescales, and the impact
of a realistic equation of state, in order to assess if the regime identified
here will develop in realistic situations. This possibility cannot, however, be
excluded a priori. This prediction is new for terrestrial atmospheres and
represents strong motivation for the use of diabatic models when analysing

networks are frequently cited as research motivations for pruning and sparsity.
However, operationalizing those benefits and understanding the end-to-end
effect of algorithm design and regularization on the runtime execution is not
often examined in depth.
  Here we apply structured and unstructured pruning to attention weights of
transformer blocks of the BERT language model, while also expanding block
sparse representation (BSR) operations in the TVM compiler. Integration of BSR
operations enables the TVM runtime execution to leverage structured pattern
sparsity induced by model regularization.
  This integrated view of pruning algorithms enables us to study relationships
between modeling decisions and their direct impact on sparsity-enhanced
execution. Our main findings are: 1) we validate that performance benefits of
structured sparsity block regularization must be enabled by the BSR
augmentations to TVM, with 4x speedup relative to vanilla PyTorch and 2.2x
speedup relative to standard TVM compilation (without expanded BSR support). 2)
for BERT attention weights, the end-to-end optimal block sparsity shape in this
CPU inference context is not a square block (as in \cite{gray2017gpu}) but
rather a linear 32x1 block 3) the relationship between performance and block

  two-hypothesis testing problem",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Reinforcement learning is generally difficult for partially observable Markov
decision processes (POMDPs), which occurs when the agent's observation is
partial or noisy. To seek good performance in POMDPs, one strategy is to endow
the agent with a finite memory, whose update is governed by the policy.
However, policy optimization is non-convex in that case and can lead to poor
training performance for random initialization. The performance can be
empirically improved by constraining the memory architecture, then sacrificing
optimality to facilitate training. Here we study this trade-off in a
two-hypothesis testing problem, akin to the two-arm bandit problem. We compare
two extreme cases: (i) the random access memory where any transitions between
$M$ memory states are allowed and (ii) a fixed memory where the agent can
access its last $m$ actions and rewards. For (i), the probability $q$ to play
the worst arm is known to be exponentially small in $M$ for the optimal policy.
Our main result is to show that similar performance can be reached for (ii) as
well, despite the simplicity of the memory architecture: using a conjecture on
Gray-ordered binary necklaces, we find policies for which $q$ is exponentially
small in $2^m$, i.e. $q\sim\alpha^{2^m}$ with $\alpha < 1$. In addition, we
observe empirically that training from random initialization leads to very poor
results for (i), and significantly better results for (ii) thanks to the
constraints on the memory architecture.

scales a Newtonian treatment of density perturbations might not be sufficient
to describe the measurements, and a fully relativistic calculation should be
employed. The interpretation of the data is thus further complicated by the
fact that relativistic effects break statistical homogeneity and isotropy and
are potentially divergent in the Infra-Red (IR). In this work we compute for

allowing for an arbitrary choice of angular and radial selection functions. We
show that any observable is free of IR sensitivity once all the GR terms,

consequence of the presence of the Weinberg adiabatic mode as a solution to
Einstein's equations. We then study the importance of GR effects, including
lensing magnification, in the interpretation of the galaxy power spectrum

a novel spatio-temporal language grounding task where the goal is to learn the
meaning of spatio-temporal descriptions of behavioral traces of an embodied

description matches a given history of observations. The descriptions involve
time-extended predicates in past and present tense as well as spatio-temporal
references to objects in the scene. To study the role of architectural biases

architectures; the latter implement different attention computations between
words and objects across space and time. We test models on two classes of
generalization: 1) generalization to randomly held-out sentences; 2)
generalization to grammar primitives. We observe that maintaining object
identity in the attention computation of our Transformers is instrumental to
achieving good performance on generalization overall, and that summarizing
object traces in a single token has little influence on performance. We then

classifier with a fixed vocabulary, previous work has shown that it is possible
to train a model that can detect whether a particular text keyword occurs in
speech utterances or not. Here we investigate whether visually grounded speech
models can also do keyword localisation: predicting where, within an utterance,
a given textual keyword occurs without any explicit text-based or alignment
supervision. We specifically consider whether incorporating attention into a
convolutional model is beneficial for localisation. Although absolute
localisation performance with visually supervised models is still modest
(compared to using unordered bag-of-word text labels for supervision), we show
that attention provides a large gain in performance over previous visually
grounded models. As in many other speech-image studies, we find that many of
the incorrect localisations are due to semantic confusions, e.g. locating the
word 'backstroke' for the query keyword 'swimming'.

Brownian Dynamics simulations, we show that conversion of supercoiled to linear
DNA topology leads to a monotonic increase in viscosity. On the other hand, the
viscosity of entangled linear DNA undergoing fragmentation displays a universal
decrease that we rationalize using living polymer theory. Finally, to showcase
the tunability of these behaviours, we design a DNA fluid that exhibits a
time-dependent increase, followed by a temporally-gated decrease, of its

naturally occurring enzymes to drive diverse time-varying rheology by

discovering very faint dwarf satellites by means of visual inspection of these
public deep images. We report the first results of a systematic survey of faint
dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the vicinity of the bright late-type spiral NGC
253 galaxy by means of a visual inspection of the images taken by the Dark

the brightest member of the Sculptor filament, the late-type spiral NGC 253.
Assuming they are companions of NGC 253, their total absolute V-magnitudes fall
in the -7 to -9 mag range, which is typical for dwarf satellites in the local
Universe. The central surface brightness tend to be extremely low for all the
discovered dwarfs and fall roughly in the range of 25-26 mag arcsec^-2 in
g-band. Using known data on distances and velocities of galaxies, we estimate
the total virial mass of the NGC 253 group to be 8 x 10^11 Mo, which gives the
virial radius R_200 = 186 kpc and the turn-around radius of 706 kpc. We also
discuss the possible existence of a spatially flattened and velocity-correlated
satellite system around NGC 253. This large-scale structure is orientated
almost edge-on to line of sight. The possible plane of satellites is only 31
kpc thick with the minor-to-major axis ratio of 0.14. Four out of five galaxies
with measured velocities follow a common velocity trend similar to those
observed in the planes of satellites around the Andromeda and Centaurus A
galaxies. However, the small number of galaxies with known velocities prevents

concern about their environmental sustainability. The current approach to
enabling sustainable clouds focuses on improving energy-efficiency and
purchasing carbon offsets. These approaches have limits: many cloud data
centers already operate near peak efficiency, and carbon offsets cannot scale
to near zero carbon where there is little carbon left to offset. Instead,
enabling sustainable clouds will require applications to adapt to when and
where unreliable low-carbon energy is available. Applications cannot do this
today because their energy use and carbon emissions are not visible to them, as
the energy system provides the rigid abstraction of a continuous, reliable
energy supply. This vision paper instead advocates for a ``carbon first''
approach to cloud design that elevates carbon-efficiency to a first-class

temperature increase in our device. Conversely, the temperature in the
suspended devices increases substantially reaching, for instance, 120 K at a
base temperature of 75 K under the employed optical pumping conditions. Such
improvements enable increasing the operation temperature by ~40 K and reducing
the lasing threshold by 30%. This approach lays the groundwork to implement new

enhanced by the COVID pandemic. In this context, drone delivery systems are of
great interest as they may allow for faster and cheaper deliveries. This paper
presents a navigation system that makes feasible the delivery of parcels with
autonomous drones. The system generates a path between a start and a final
point and controls the drone to follow this path based on its localization
obtained through GPS, 9DoF IMU, and barometer. In the landing phase,
information of poses estimated by a marker (ArUco) detection technique using a
camera, ultra-wideband (UWB) devices, and the drone's software estimation are
merged by utilizing an Extended Kalman Filter algorithm to improve the landing
precision. A vector field-based method controls the drone to follow the desired
path smoothly, reducing vibrations or harsh movements that could harm the
transported parcel. Real experiments validate the delivery strategy and allow
to evaluate the performance of the adopted techniques. Preliminary results
state the viability of our proposal for autonomous drone delivery.

novel aperiodic structures that manifest the intrinsic complexity of prime
number distributions in imaginary quadratic fields. In particular, we address
structure-property relationships and wave scattering through the prime elements
of the nine imaginary quadratic fields (i.e., of their associated rings of
integers) with class number one, which are unique factorization domains (UFDs).
Our theoretical analysis combines the rigorous Green's matrix solution of the
multiple scattering problem with the interdisciplinary methods of spatial
statistics and graph theory analysis of point patterns to unveil the relevant
structural properties that produce wave localization effects. The onset of a
Delocalization-Localization Transition (DLT) is demonstrated by a comprehensive
study of the spectral properties of the Green's matrix and the Thouless number
as a function of their optical density. Furthermore, we employ Multifractal
Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MDFA) to establish the multifractal scaling of
the local density of states in these complex structures and we discover a
direct connection between localization, multifractality, and graph connectivity
properties. Finally, we use a semi-classical approach to demonstrate and
characterize the strong coupling regime of quantum emitters embedded in these
novel aperiodic environments. Our study provides access to engineering design
rules for the fabrication of novel and more efficient classical and quantum
sources as well as photonic devices with enhanced light-matter interaction

the DNN library can only handle floating-point numbers. However, the accuracy

Consequently, directly applying deep learning methods for object detection

modify loss function from cross entropy to Kullback-Leibler divergence which
accommodates uncertainty in the labeling process. We implement the proposed

show that our design can effectively overcome the impact of imprecise and

critical in e-commerce voice assistants that involve monetary transactions and

specific content words from speech. In this paper, we investigate various
techniques to improve contextualization, content word robustness and domain
adaptation of a Transformer-XL neural language model (NLM) to rescore ASR
N-best hypotheses. To improve contextualization, we utilize turn level dialogue

from a finetuned masked LM on in-domain data. Finally, to improve robustness
towards in-domain content words, we propose a multi-task model that can jointly
perform content word detection and language modeling tasks. Compared to a
non-contextual LSTM LM baseline, our best performing NLM rescorer results in a
content WER reduction of 19.2% on e-commerce audio test set and a slot labeling

polarized source must also maintain minimal right-left helicity correlated beam

design of the Pockels cell used to generate the circularly polarized light.
Rubidium Titanyl Phosphate (RTP) has been used in recent years for ultra-fast
Pockels cell switches due to its lack of piezo-electric resonances at

study the effects of differentially private synthetic data generation on

of results show that although there seems to be a clear negative correlation
between privacy and utility (the more private, the less accurate) across all

the atemporal training of a phasor network on standard deep learning tasks and
show that these networks can then be executed in either the traditional
