it is difficult for teachers to provide constructive feedback and instill
collaborative skills using instructional methods. Development of simple and

this problem. Improving upon our previous work, in this paper we propose using
simple temporal-CNN deep-learning models to assess student group collaboration
that take in temporal representations of individual student roles as input. We
check the applicability of dynamically changing feature representations for
student group collaboration assessment and how they impact the overall
performance. We also use Grad-CAM visualizations to better understand and
interpret the important temporal indices that led to the deep-learning model's

this purpose, a free, open-source, and computationally efficient environment
(Julia) for dynamic simulation of power grids is used to demonstrate its
capabilities. The model implementation is validated against established
commercial software and deviations are minimal with respect to power flow and
dynamic simulations.The results of a large-scale survivability analysis reveal
i) a broad field of application for probabilistic stability analysis and ii)
that new non-intuitive stability correlations can be obtained. Hence,the
proposed method shows strong potential to efficiently conduct power system

competitive parameters to draw a fairness comparison between the sides and
propose a weighting criterion to point out the sides that enjoyed this schedule
more than the others. Furthermore, we use root mean squared error between an

attention in modern statistical research, yet not much progress has been made
in large-scale multiple testing specifically designed for analysing such data
sets. Motivated by this, we consider in this article an electroencephalography
(EEG) experiment that produces matrix-valued data and presents a scope of
developing novel matrix-valued data based multiple testing methods controlling
false discoveries for hypotheses that are of importance in such an experiment.
The row-column cross-dependency of observations appearing in a matrix form,
referred to as double-dependency, is one of the main challenges in the
development of such methods. We address it by assuming matrix normal
distribution for the observations at each of the independent matrix
data-points. This allows us to fully capture the underlying double-dependency
informed through the row- and column-covariance matrices and develop methods
that are potentially more powerful than the corresponding one (e.g., Fan and
Han (2017)) obtained by vectorizing each data point and thus ignoring the
double-dependency. We propose two methods to approximate the false discovery
proportion with statistical accuracy. While one of these methods is a general
approach under double-dependency, the other one provides more computational
efficiency for higher dimensionality. Extensive numerical studies illustrate
the superior performance of the proposed methods over the principal factor
approximation method of Fan and Han (2017). The proposed methods have been
further applied to the aforementioned EEG data.

While deep learning methods are an effective tool for these problems, they

learning framework for multivariable time series classification. In the first
stage of our framework, encoders extract features from each variable
independently. Prototype layers identify single-variable prototypes in the
resulting feature spaces. The next stage of our framework represents the
multivariable time series sample points in terms of their similarity to these

representation of multivariable patterns, on which prototype learning is
applied to extract representative examples i.e. multivariable prototypes. Our
framework is thus able to explicitly identify both informative patterns in the
individual variables, as well as the relationships between the variables. We
validate our framework on a simulated dataset with embedded patterns, as well
as a real human activity recognition problem. Our framework attains comparable
or superior classification performance to existing time series classification
methods on these tasks. On the simulated dataset, we find that our model
returns interpretations consistent with the embedded patterns. Moreover, the

such as predicting the properties of molecules. But in practice, precise graph
annotations are generally very expensive and time-consuming. To address this
issue, graph contrastive learning constructs instance discrimination task which
pulls together positive pairs (augmentation pairs of the same graph) and pushes
away negative pairs (augmentation pairs of different graphs) for unsupervised
representation learning. However, since for a query, its negatives are
uniformly sampled from all graphs, existing methods suffer from the critical
sampling bias issue, i.e., the negatives likely having the same semantic
structure with the query, leading to performance degradation. To mitigate this
sampling bias issue, in this paper, we propose a Prototypical Graph Contrastive
Learning (PGCL) approach. Specifically, PGCL models the underlying semantic
structure of the graph data via clustering semantically similar graphs into the
same group, and simultaneously encourages the clustering consistency for
different augmentations of the same graph. Then given a query, it performs
negative sampling via drawing the graphs from those clusters that differ from
the cluster of query, which ensures the semantic difference between query and
its negative samples. Moreover, for a query, PGCL further reweights its
negative samples based on the distance between their prototypes (cluster
centroids) and the query prototype such that those negatives having moderate
prototype distance enjoy relatively large weights. This reweighting strategy is
proved to be more effective than uniform sampling. Experimental results on
various graph benchmarks testify the advantages of our PGCL over
state-of-the-art methods. Code is publicly available at

where a nonlinear breaking of the Lorentz reciprocity is observed. The device
under test consists of a racetrack microresonator, with an embedded S-shaped
waveguide, coupled to an external bus waveguide (BW). This geometry of the
microresonator, known as ""taiji"" microresonator (TJMR), allows to selectively
couple counter-propagating modes depending on the propagation direction of the
incident light and, at the nonlinear level, leads to an effective breaking of
Lorentz reciprocity. Here, we show that a full description of the device needs
to consider also the role of the BW, which introduces (i) Fabry-Perot
oscillations (FPOs) due to reflections at its facets, and (ii) asymmetric
losses, which depend on the actual position of the TJMR. At sufficiently low
powers the asymmetric loss does not affect the unidirectional behavior, but the
FP interference fringes can cancel the effect of the S-shaped waveguide.
However, at high input power, both the asymmetric loss and the FPOs contribute
to the redistribution of the energy between the clockwise and counterclockwise
modes within the TJMR. This strongly modifies the nonlinear response, giving
rise to counter-intuitive features where, due to the FP effect and the
asymmetric losses, the BW properties can determine the violation of the Lorentz
reciprocity and, in particular, the difference between the transmittance in the
two directions of excitation. The experimental results are explained by using
an analytical model based on the transfer matrix approach, a numerical

Transformer models, which leads to consistent performance improvements over

effectiveness stems from the ability of jointly attending multiple positions.
In this paper, we first demonstrate that jointly attending multiple positions
is not a unique feature of multi-head attention, as multi-layer single-head
attention also attends multiple positions and is more effective. Then, we
suggest the main advantage of the multi-head attention is the training
stability, since it has less number of layers than the single-head attention,
when attending the same number of positions. For example, 24-layer 16-head
Transformer (BERT-large) and 384-layer single-head Transformer has the same
total attention head number and roughly the same model size, while the
multi-head one is significantly shallower. Meanwhile, we show that, with recent

substantially deeper single-head Transformer achieves consistent performance
improvements without tuning hyper-parameters.

novel device architecture of a graphene microcavity defined by
carefully-engineered local strain and electrostatic fields. We create a
controlled electron-optic interference process at zero magnetic field as a
consequence of consecutive Veselago refractions in the microcavity and provide
direct experimental evidence through low-temperature electrical transport

Veselago interference to localize uncollimated electrons and characterize its

severe material damage. Furthermore, in a circular collider, the performance in
terms of peak luminosity depends to a large extent on the aperture of the inner
triplet quadrupoles, which are used to focus the beams at the interaction
points. In the LHC, this aperture represents the smallest aperture at
top-energy with squeezed beams and determines the maximum potential reach of
the peak luminosity. Beam-based aperture measurements in these conditions are
difficult and challenging. In this paper, we present different methods that

theories beyond General Relativity. As a continuation to this series, we here
focus on the quasinormal modes of nonrotating black holes in scalar
Gauss-Bonnet gravity assuming a small-coupling expansion. We show that the
axial perturbations are purely tensorial and are described by a modified
Regge-Wheeler equation, while the polar perturbations are of mixed
scalar-tensor character and are described by a system of two coupled wave
equations. When applied to these equations, the eikonal machinery leads to
axial modes that deviate from the general relativistic results at quadratic
order in the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant. We show that this result is in
agreement with an analysis of unstable circular null orbits around blackholes
in this theory, allowing us to establish the geometrical optics-null geodesic
correspondence for the axial modes. For the polar modes the small-coupling
approximation forces us to consider the ordering between eikonal and
small-coupling perturbative parameters; one of which we show, by explicit
comparison against numerical data, yields the correct identification of the
quasinormal modes of the scalar-tensor coupled system of wave equations. These
corrections lift the general relativistic degeneracy between scalar and
tensorial eikonal quasinormal modes at quadratic order in Gauss-Bonnet coupling
in a way reminiscent of the Zeeman effect. In general, our analytic, eikonal
quasinormal mode frequencies (normalized to the General Relativity ones) agree
with numerical results with an error of $\sim 10\%$ in the regime of small

cannot hold; that is, the dimension of the intersections of a fixed set with a
parallel family of planes do not determine the dimension of the set. Here we
prove that a Fubini theorem for Hausdorff dimension does hold modulo sets that
are small on all Lipschitz graphs.
  We say that $G\subset \mathbb{R}^k\times \mathbb{R}^n$ is $\Gamma_k$-null if
for every Lipschitz function $f:\mathbb{R}^k\to \mathbb{R}^n$ the set
$\{t\in\mathbb{R}^k\,:\,(t,f(t))\in G\}$ has measure zero. We show that for
every Borel set $E\subset \mathbb{R}^k\times \mathbb{R}^n$ with $\dim
(\text{proj}_{\mathbb{R}^k} E)=k$ there is a $\Gamma_k$-null subset $G\subset
E$ such that $$\dim (E\setminus G) = k+\text{ess-}\sup(\dim E_t)$$ where
$\text{ess-}\sup(\dim E_t)$ is the essential supremum of the Hausdorff
dimension of the vertical sections $\{E_t\}_{t\in \mathbb{R}^k}$ of $E$. In
addition, we show that, provided that $E$ is not $\Gamma_k$-null, there is a
$\Gamma_k$-null subset $G\subset E$ such that for $F=E \setminus G$, the
Fubini-property holds, that is, $\dim (F) = k+\text{ess-}\sup(\dim F_t)$.
  We also obtain more general results by replacing $\mathbb{R}^k$ by an
Ahlfors-David regular set. Applications of our results include Fubini-type
results for unions of affine subspaces, connection to the Kakeya conjecture and
projection theorems.

trans-rectal ultrasound (TRUS) images using convolutional neural networks

of image-guided interventions on the prostate. Fast and accurate segmentation
on the organ in these images is crucial to planning and fusion with other
modalities such as magnetic resonance images (MRIs) . However, TRUS has limited
soft tissue contrast and signal to noise ratio which makes the task of
segmenting the prostate challenging and subject to inter-observer and
intra-observer variability. This is especially problematic at the base and apex
where the gland boundary is hard to define. In this paper, we aim to tackle
this problem by taking advantage of shape priors learnt on an MR dataset which
has higher soft tissue contrast allowing the prostate to be contoured more
accurately. We use this shape prior in combination with a prostate tissue
probability map computed by a CNN for segmentation.

free subshift $\mathcal{S} \subseteq \mathrm{Free}(2^\Gamma)$ such that every

follows. Let $\mathcal{S}$ be a subshift of finite type (for example,
$\mathcal{S}$ could be the set of all proper colorings of the Cayley graph of
$\Gamma$ with some finite number of colors). Suppose that $\pi \colon
\mathrm{Free}(k^\Gamma) \to \mathcal{S}$ is a continuous $\Gamma$-equivariant
map and let $\mathrm{Stab}(\pi)$ be the set of all group elements that fix
every point in the image of $\pi$. Unless $\pi$ is constant,
$\mathrm{Stab}(\pi)$ is a finite normal subgroup of $\Gamma$. We prove that
there exists a subshift $\mathcal{S}' \subseteq \mathcal{S}$ such that the
stabilizer of every point in $\mathcal{S}'$ is $\mathrm{Stab}(\pi)$ and every

trivial), then the subshift $\mathcal{S}'$ is free. As an application of this
general result, we deduce that if $F$ is a finite symmetric subset of $\Gamma
\setminus \{\mathbf{1}\}$ of size $|F| = d \geq 1$ and $\mathrm{Col}(F, d + 1)

that cause overfitting. The overfitting recognizes by matrix and tensor
condition numbers. An adaptive regularization scheme entitled Adaptive Low-Rank
(ALR) is proposed that converges a subset of the weighting layers to their
Low-Rank Factorization (LRF). It happens by minimizing a new Tikhonov-based
loss function. ALR also encourages lazy weights to contribute to the
regularization when epochs grow up. It uses a damping sequence to increment
layer selection likelihood in the last generations. Thus before falling the
training accuracy, ALR reduces the lazy weights and regularizes the network
substantially. The experimental results show that ALR regularizes the deep

transformation between the JOKRs. This augments the representation to be affine
invariant, and in practice broadens the variety of possible retargeting pairs.
This geometry-driven representation enables further intuitive control, such as
temporal coherence and manual editing. Through comprehensive experimentation,
we demonstrate the applicability of our method to different challenging
cross-domain video pairs. We evaluate our method both qualitatively and
quantitatively, and demonstrate that our method handles various cross-domain
scenarios, such as different animals, different flowers, and humans. We also
demonstrate superior temporal coherency and visual quality compared to
state-of-the-art alternatives, through statistical metrics and a user study.

recently shown much promise for computer vision. The self-attention operation
underlying transformers yields global interactions between all tokens ,i.e.
words or image patches, and enables flexible modelling of image data beyond the
local interactions of convolutions. This flexibility, however, comes with a
quadratic complexity in time and memory, hindering application to long
sequences and high-resolution images. We propose a ""transposed"" version of
self-attention that operates across feature channels rather than tokens, where
the interactions are based on the cross-covariance matrix between keys and
queries. The resulting cross-covariance attention (XCA) has linear complexity
in the number of tokens, and allows efficient processing of high-resolution

combines the accuracy of conventional transformers with the scalability of
convolutional architectures. We validate the effectiveness and generality of
XCiT by reporting excellent results on multiple vision benchmarks, including
image classification and self-supervised feature learning on ImageNet-1k,
object detection and instance segmentation on COCO, and semantic segmentation

deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B

LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank
decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly
reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to
GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable

performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa,
DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher
training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We

memory and less time. However, we pay a price for the savings: lower precision
may yield larger round-off error and hence larger prediction error. As
applications proliferate, users must choose which precision to use to train a
new model, and chip manufacturers must decide which precisions to manufacture.
We view these precision choices as a hyperparameter tuning problem, and borrow
ideas from meta-learning to learn the tradeoff between memory and error. In
this paper, we introduce Pareto Estimation to Pick the Perfect Precision
(PEPPP). We use matrix factorization to find non-dominated configurations (the
Pareto frontier) with a limited number of network evaluations. For any given
memory budget, the precision that minimizes error is a point on this frontier.
Practitioners can use the frontier to trade memory for error and choose the
best precision for their goals.

is a collection of vertex-disjoint copies of $F$ in $G$. For $r\in \mathbb{N}$,
the $r$-independence number of $G$, denoted $\alpha_r(G)$ is the largest size
of a $K_r$-free set of vertices in $G$. In this paper, we discuss
Ramsey--Tur\'an-type theorems for tilings where one is interested in minimum
degree and independence number conditions (and the interaction between the two)
that guarantee the existence of optimal $F$-tilings. For cliques, we show that
for any $k\geq 3$ and $\eta>0$, any graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with
$\delta(G)\geq \eta n$ and $\alpha_k(G)=o(n)$ has a $K_k$-tiling covering all
but $\lfloor\tfrac{1}{\eta}\rfloor(k-1)$ vertices. All conditions in this
result are tight; the number of vertices left uncovered can not be improved and
for $\eta<\tfrac{1}{k}$, a condition of $\alpha_{k-1}(G)=o(n)$ would not
suffice. When $\eta>\tfrac{1}{k}$, we then show that $\alpha_{k-1}(G)=o(n)$
does suffice, but not $\alpha_{k-2}(G)=o(n)$. These results unify and
generalise previous results of Balogh-Molla-Sharifzadeh, Nenadov-Pehova and
Balogh-McDowell-Molla-Mycroft on the subject. We further explore the picture
when $F$ is a tree or a cycle and discuss the effect of replacing the
independence number condition with $\alpha^*(G)=o(n)$ (meaning that any pair of
disjoint linear sized sets induce an edge between them) where one can force
perfect $F$-tilings covering all the vertices. Finally we discuss the
consequences of these results in the randomly perturbed setting.

in size, where unsupervised detection algorithms can help users process data.
To detect change points, a number of unsupervised algorithms have been
developed which are based on different principles. One approach is to define an
optimisation problem and minimise a cost function along with a penalty
function. In the optimisation approach, the choice of the cost function affects
the predictions made by the algorithm. In extension to the existing studies, a
new type of cost function using Tikhonov regularisation is introduced. Another
approach uses Bayesian statistics to calculate the posterior probability
distribution of a specific point being a change point. It uses a priori
knowledge on the distance between consecutive change points and a likelihood
function with information about the segments. The optimisation and Bayesian
approaches for offline change point detection are studied and applied to
simulated datasets as well as a real world multi-phase dataset. The approaches
have previously been studied separately and a novelty lies in comparing the
predictions made by the two approaches in a specific setting, consisting of
simulated datasets and a real world example. The study has found that the
performance of the change point detection algorithms are affected by the

However, these benchmarks do not enable us to measure an agent's granular

paper, we propose a new benchmark for physical reasoning that allows us to test
individual physical reasoning capabilities. Inspired by how humans acquire
these capabilities, we propose a general hierarchy of physical reasoning
capabilities with increasing complexity. Our benchmark tests capabilities
according to this hierarchy through generated physical reasoning tasks in the
video game Angry Birds. This benchmark enables us to conduct a comprehensive
agent evaluation by measuring the agent's granular physical reasoning
capabilities. We conduct an evaluation with human players, learning agents, and
heuristic agents and determine their capabilities. Our evaluation shows that
learning agents, with good local generalization ability, still struggle to
learn the underlying physical reasoning capabilities and perform worse than

challenges such as population growth and climate change. The design of cities

efficient solutions must be found to transport people and goods throughout the
city in an ecological way. An autonomous bicycle-sharing system would combine
the most relevant benefits of vehicle sharing, electrification, autonomy, and
micro-mobility, increasing the efficiency and convenience of bicycle-sharing
systems and incentivizing more people to bike and enjoy their cities in an
environmentally friendly way. Due to the uniqueness and radical novelty of
introducing autonomous driving technology into bicycle-sharing systems and the
inherent complexity of these systems, there is a need to quantify the potential
impact of autonomy on fleet performance and user experience. This paper
presents an ad-hoc agent-based simulator that provides an in-depth
understanding of the fleet behavior of autonomous bicycle-sharing systems in
realistic scenarios, including a rebalancing system based on demand prediction.
In addition, this work describes the impact of different parameters on system
efficiency and service quality and quantifies the extent to which an autonomous
system would outperform current bicycle-sharing schemes. The obtained results
show that with a fleet size three and a half times smaller than a station-based
system and eight times smaller than a dockless system, an autonomous system can
provide overall improved performance and user experience even with no
rebalancing. These findings indicate that the remarkable efficiency of an
autonomous bicycle-sharing system could compensate for the additional cost of
autonomous bicycles.

video datasets contain many action labels but do not contain ground-truth 3D
human motion. Alternatively, motion-capture (mocap) datasets have precise body
motions but are limited to a small number of actions. To address this, we
present BABEL, a large dataset with language labels describing the actions
being performed in mocap sequences. BABEL consists of action labels for about
43 hours of mocap sequences from AMASS. Action labels are at two levels of
abstraction -- sequence labels describe the overall action in the sequence, and
frame labels describe all actions in every frame of the sequence. Each frame
label is precisely aligned with the duration of the corresponding action in the
mocap sequence, and multiple actions can overlap. There are over 28k sequence
labels, and 63k frame labels in BABEL, which belong to over 250 unique action
categories. Labels from BABEL can be leveraged for tasks like action
recognition, temporal action localization, motion synthesis, etc. To
demonstrate the value of BABEL as a benchmark, we evaluate the performance of
models on 3D action recognition. We demonstrate that BABEL poses interesting
learning challenges that are applicable to real-world scenarios, and can serve
as a useful benchmark of progress in 3D action recognition. The dataset,

a sample of 2226 nearby bright disk galaxies. Examining the relationship
between spiral arms, star formation rate (SFR), and stellar mass, we find that
arm strength correlates well with the variation of SFR as a function of stellar
mass. Arms are stronger above the star-forming galaxy main sequence (MS) and
weaker below it: arm strength increases with higher $\log\,({\rm SFR}/{\rm
SFR}_{\rm MS})$, where ${\rm SFR}_{\rm MS}$ is the SFR along the MS. Likewise,
stronger arms are associated with higher specific SFR. We confirm this trend
using the optical colors of a larger sample of 4378 disk galaxies, whose
position on the blue cloud also depends systematically on spiral arm strength.
This link is independent of other galaxy structural parameters. For the subset
of galaxies with cold gas measurements, arm strength positively correlates with
HI and H$_2$ mass fraction, even after removing the mutual dependence on
$\log\,({\rm SFR}/{\rm SFR}_{\rm MS})$, consistent with the notion that spiral
arms are maintained by dynamical cooling provided by gas damping. For a given
gas fraction, stronger arms lead to higher $\log\,({\rm SFR}/{\rm SFR}_{\rm
MS})$, resulting in a trend of increasing arm strength with shorter gas
depletion time. We suggest a physical picture in which the dissipation process
provided by gas damping maintains spiral structure, which, in turn, boosts the
star formation efficiency of the gas reservoir.

mass--radius relation for the low-mass planets discovered so far by transit
surveys orbiting solar-type stars requires both occurrence-weighted median
Earth-mass and Neptune-mass planets to have a few percent of their masses in
hydrogen/helium (H/He) atmospheres. Unlike the Earth that finished forming long
after the protosolar nebula was dissipated, these occurrence-weighted median
Earth-mass planets must have formed early in their systems' histories. The
existence of significant H/He atmospheres around Earth-mass planets confirms an
important prediction of the core-accretion model of planet formation. It also
implies core masses $M_{\text{c}}$ in the range $2~M_{\oplus}\lesssim
M_{\text{c}}\lesssim 8~M_{\oplus}$ that can retain their primordial
atmospheres. If atmospheric escape is driven by photoevaporation due to extreme
ultraviolet (EUV) flux, then our observation requires a reduction in the
fraction of incident EUV flux converted into work usually assumed in
photoevaporation models. If atmospheric escape is core driven, then the
occurrence-weighted median Earth-mass planets must have large Bond albedos. In
contrast to Uranus and Neptune that have at least 10% of their masses in H/He
atmospheres, these occurrence-weighted median Neptune-mass planets are H/He
poor. The implication is that they experienced collisions or formed in much
shorter-lived and/or hotter parts of their parent protoplanetary disks than

of de Sitter space and the phenomenology of inflation. In the leading
approximation, this approach results in a Fokker-Planck equation that
calculates the probability distribution for a light scalar field as a function
of time. Despite its successes, the quantum field theoretic origins and the
range of validity for this equation have remained elusive, and establishing a
formalism to systematically incorporate higher order effects has been an area
of active study. In this paper, we calculate the next-to-next-to-leading order
(NNLO) corrections to Stochastic Inflation using Soft de Sitter Effective
Theory (SdSET). In this effective description, Stochastic Inflation manifests
as the renormalization group evolution of composite operators. The leading
impact of non-Gaussian quantum fluctuations appears at NNLO, which is presented
here for the first time; we derive the coefficient of this term from a two-loop
anomalous dimension calculation within SdSET. We solve the resulting equation
to determine the NNLO equilibrium distribution and the low-lying relaxation
eigenvalues. In the process, we must match the UV theory onto SdSET at one-loop
order, which provides a non-trivial confirmation that the separation into
Wilson-coefficient corrections and contributions to initial conditions persists
beyond tree level. Furthermore, these results illustrate how the naive
factorization of time and momentum integrals in SdSET no longer holds in the
presence of logarithmic divergences. It is these effects that ultimately give
rise to the renormalization group flow that yields Stochastic Inflation.

galaxy formation physics. We perform dark matter-only, zoomed simulations of
two Milky Way-mass hosts and make targeted, controlled changes to their

each history's stellar halo with a semi-empirical, particle tagging approach
then enables a controlled study, with all instances converging to the same
large-scale structure, dynamical and stellar mass at $z=0$ as their reference.
These related merger scenarios alone generate an extended spread in stellar
halo mass fractions (1.5 dex) comparable to the observed population, with the
largest scatter achieved by growing late ($z\leq1$) major mergers that spread
out existing stars to create massive, in-situ dominated stellar haloes.
Increasing a last major merger at $z\sim2$ brings more accreted stars into the
inner regions, resulting in smaller scatter in the outskirts which are
predominantly built by subsequent minor events. Exploiting the flexibility of
our semi-empirical approach, we show that the diversity of stellar halo masses
across scenarios is reduced by allowing shallower slopes in the stellar
mass--halo mass relation for dwarf galaxies, while it remains conserved when
central stars are born with hotter kinematics across cosmic time. The
merger-dependent diversity of stellar haloes thus responds distinctly to
assumptions in modelling the central and dwarf galaxies respectively, opening
exciting prospects to constrain star formation and feedback at different
galactic mass-scales with the coming generation of deep, photometric

short-wavelength regime, the conversion effect may be understood in terms of a
phase that accumulates along a ray. We compute the scattering angle for which
the converted and scattered fluxes are equal, as a function of charge-to-mass
ratio. We show that this scattering angle approaches $90$ degrees in the
extremal limit.

have found the gas mass fraction in the northern direction to be significantly
above the expected level, indicating that there may be a very high level of gas
clumping on small scales in this direction. Here, we explore the XMM-Newton
data in the outskirts of Virgo, dividing it into a Voronoi tessellation to
separate the bulk ICM component from the clumped ICM component. As the nearest
galaxy cluster, Virgo's large angular extent allows the spatial scale of the
tessellation to be much smaller than has been achieved using the same technique
on intermediate redshift clusters, allowing us to probe gas clumping on the
scales down to 5$\times$5 kpc. We find that the level of gas clumping in the
outskirts to the north is relatively mild, ($\sqrt{C} < 1.1$), suggesting that
our point-source detection procedure may have excluded a significant fraction
of clumps. While correcting for clumping brings the gas mass fraction at
$r_{200}$ into agreement with the universal gas mass fraction, the values
outside $r_{200}$ remain significantly above it. This may suggest that
non-thermal pressure support in the outskirts to the north is significant, and
we find that a non-thermal pressure support at the level of 20 per cent of the
total pressure outside $r_{200}$ can explain the high gas mass fraction to the
north, which is in agreement with the range expected from simulations.

initial mass functions. Near-infrared seeing-limited ground-based surveys
typically discover a factor of 3-10 fewer SNe than predicted from far-infrared
(FIR) luminosities owing to sensitivity limitations arising from both a
variable point-spread function (PSF) and high dust extinction in the nuclear
regions of star-forming galaxies. This inconsistency has potential implications
for our understanding of star-formation rates and massive-star evolution,
particularly at higher redshifts, where star-forming galaxies are more common.
To resolve this inconsistency, a successful SN survey in the local universe
must be conducted at longer wavelengths and with a space-based telescope, which
has a stable PSF to reduce the necessity for any subtraction algorithms and
thus residuals. Here we report on a two-year Spitzer/IRAC 3.6 um survey for
dust-extinguished SNe in the nuclear regions of forty luminous infrared
galaxies (LIRGs) within 200 Mpc. The asymmetric Spitzer PSF results in worse
than expected subtraction residuals when implementing standard template
subtraction. Forward-modeling techniques improve our sensitivity by ~1.5
magnitudes. We report the detection of 9 SNe, five of which were not discovered
by optical surveys. After adjusting our predicted rates to account for the
sensitivity of our survey, we find that the number of detections is consistent
with the models. While this search is nonetheless hampered by a
difficult-to-model PSF and the relatively poor resolution of Spitzer, it will
benefit from future missions, such as Roman Space Telescope and JWST, with
higher resolution and more symmetric PSFs.

nuclear equation of state (EOS) describing these dense environments is yet
uncertain, and variations in its prescription affect the proto-neutron star
(PNS) and the post-bounce dynamics in CCSNe simulations, subsequently impacting
the GW emission. We perform axisymmetric simulations of CCSNe with Skyrme-type
EOSs to study how the GW signal and PNS convection zone are impacted by two
experimentally accessible EOS parameters, (1) the effective mass of nucleons,
$m^\star$, which is crucial in setting the thermal dependence of the EOS, and
(2) the isoscalar incompressibility modulus, $K_{\rm{sat}}$. While
$K_{\rm{sat}}$ shows little impact, the peak frequency of the GWs has a strong
effective mass dependence due to faster contraction of the PNS for higher
values of $m^\star$ owing to a decreased thermal pressure. These more compact
PNSs also exhibit more neutrino heating which drives earlier explosions and
correlates with the GW amplitude via accretion plumes striking the PNS,
exciting the oscillations. We investigate the spatial origin of the GWs and
show the agreement between a frequency-radial distribution of the GW emission
and a perturbation analysis. We do not rule out overshoot from below via PNS
convection as another moderately strong excitation mechanism in our
simulations. We also study the combined effect of effective mass and rotation.
In all our simulations we find evidence for a power gap near $\sim$1250 Hz, we
investigate its origin and report its EOS dependence.

magnetic field and irrespective of the luminosity, strong central fields of
about $10^{14}\, {\rm G}$ can yield super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs with
masses up to $1.9\, M_{\odot}$. Smaller white dwarfs tend to remain
super-Chandrasekhar for sufficiently strong central fields even when their
luminosity is significantly suppressed to $10^{-16}\ L_{\odot}$. Owing to the
cooling evolution and simultaneous field decay over $10\ {\rm Gyr}$, the
limiting masses of small magnetised white dwarfs can fall to $1.5\ M_{\odot}$
over time. However the majority of these systems still remain practically
hidden throughout their cooling evolution because of their high fields and
correspondingly low luminosities. Utilising the stellar evolution code

the first detections of an off-axis jet+cocoon system in a massive star.

work, we introduce the most careful comparison yet of galaxy formation

calibration steps each of which is designed to reduce the number of tunable

cosmological simulations with similar mass assembly histories down to $z=4$.
With numerical accuracy that resolves the internal structure of a target halo,
we find that the codes overall agree well with one another in e.g., gas and
stellar properties, but also show differences in e.g., circumgalactic medium
properties. We argue that, if adequately tested in accordance with our proposed

prescription for assigning realistic dust attenuation to simulated galaxies
based on their physical properties. We use the EDA to forward model synthetic
observations for three state-of-the-art large-scale cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations: SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, and EAGLE. We then compare the optical and UV
color-magnitude relations, $(g-r) - M_r$ and $(FUV-NUV)-M_r$, of the
simulations to a $M_r < -20$ and UV complete SDSS galaxy sample using
likelihood-free inference. Without dust, none of the simulations match
observations, as expected. With the EDA, however, we can reproduce the observed
color-magnitude with all three simulations. Furthermore, the attenuation curves
predicted by our dust prescription are in good agreement with the observed
attenuation-slope relations and attenuation curves of star-forming galaxies.
However, the EDA does not predict star-forming galaxies with low $A_V$ since
simulated star-forming galaxies are intrinsically much brighter than
observations. Additionally, the EDA provides, for the first time, predictions
on the attenuation curves of quiescent galaxies, which are challenging to
measure observationally. Simulated quiescent galaxies require shallower
attenuation curves with lower amplitude than star-forming galaxies. The EDA,
combined with forward modeling, provides an effective approach for shedding
light on dust in galaxies and probing hydrodynamical simulations. This work
also illustrates a major limitation in comparing galaxy formation models: by
adjusting dust attenuation, simulations that predict significantly different
galaxy populations can reproduce the same UV and optical observations.

observations of a range of high critical density molecular tracers (HCN, HNC,
HCO+) and CO isotopologues (13CO, C18O) towards the nearby (11.3 Mpc), strongly

angular resolution (1.85""; 100 pc) map of dense gas tracers across a disc of a
nearby spiral galaxy, which we use here to assess the properties of the dense

molecular gas, and star formation. We find that the HCN(1-0)/CO(2-1) integrated
intensity ratio does not correlate with the amount of recent star formation.
Instead, the HCN(1-0)/CO(2-1) ratio depends on the galactic environment, with
differences between the galaxy centre, bar, and bar end regions. The dense gas
in the central 600 pc appears to produce stars less efficiently despite
containing a higher fraction of dense molecular gas than the bar ends where the
star formation is enhanced. In assessing the dynamics of the dense gas, we find
the HCN(1-0) and HCO+(1-0) emission lines showing multiple components towards
regions in the bar ends that correspond to previously identified features in CO

highlights that the complex dynamics of this bar end region could be linked to
local enhancements in the star formation.

process in the most powerful radio-loud AGN. We applied a nonparametric
analysis to the [O~III] $\lambda$5007 emission line, whose asymmetries and
high-velocity wings reveal signatures of outflows. We find evidence of nuclear
outflows in 21 sources, with velocities between $\sim$400 - 1000 km s$^{-1}$,
outflowing masses of $\sim 10^5-10^7$ M$_\odot$, and a kinetic energy in the
range $\sim 10^{53} - 10^{56}$ erg. In addition, evidence for extended outflows
is found in the 2D gas velocity maps of 13 sources of the subclasses of
high-excitation (HEG) and broad-line (BLO) radio galaxies, with sizes between
0.4 and 20 kpc. We estimate a mass outflow rate in the range 0.4 - 30 M$_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$ and an energy deposition rate of ${\dot E}_{kin} \sim 10^{42}-10^{45}
$ erg s$^{-1}$. Comparing the jet power, the nuclear luminosity of the active
galactic nucleus, and the outflow kinetic energy rate, we find that outflows of
HEGs and BLOs are likely radiatively powered, while jets likely only play a
dominant role in galaxies with low excitation. The low loading factors we
measured suggest that these outflows are driven by momentum and not by energy.
Based on the gas masses, velocities, and energetics involved, we conclude that
the observed ionized outflows have a limited effect on the gas content or the
star formation in the host. In order to obtain a complete view of the feedback
process, observations exploring the complex multiphase structure of outflows
are required.

Standard Model of particle physics, with close connections to axion dark matter
physics. Recent studies suggest that, although subdominant relative to
Goldstone emission, gravitational wave (GW) signals from global strings can be
detectable with current and planned GW detectors such as LIGO, LISA,
DECIGO/BBO, ET/CE and AEDGE/AION, as well as pulsar timing arrays such as PPTA,
NANOGrav and SKA. This work is an extensive, updated study on GWs from a global
cosmic string network, taking into account of the most recent developments
related to the subject. The main analysis is based on the analytical
Velocity-dependent One-Scale (VOS) model calibrated with recent simulation
results, which provides a generic protocol for such calculations with details
given. We also demonstrate how the GW signal can be influenced with variations
to the baseline model: this includes considering the uncertainties of model
parameters and the potential deviation from the conventional VOS model
prediction (i.e. the scaling behavior) as suggested by some of the recent
simulation results. Furthermore, we investigated in detail the effect of a
non-standard cosmology (e.g. early matter domination or kination) or new
particle species on the GW signals from global strings. We demonstrate that the
frequency spectrum of GW background from global cosmic strings can be used to
probe the cosmic history prior to the Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) (i.e. the
primordial dark age) up to a temperature of $T\sim 10^8$ GeV.

without any sort of limiting process. For a generic classical CFT$_{2}$, the
BMS$_{3}$ generators then emerge as composites built out from the chiral
(holomorphic) components of the stress-energy tensor, $T$ and $\bar{T}$,
closing in the Poisson brackets at equal time slices. Nevertheless,
supertranslation generators do not span Noetherian symmetries. BMS$_{3}$
becomes a bona fide symmetry once the CFT$_{2}$ is marginally deformed by the
addition of a $\sqrt{T\bar{T}}$ term to the Hamiltonian. The generic deformed
theory is manifestly invariant under diffeomorphisms and local scalings, but it
is no longer a CFT$_{2}$ because its energy and momentum densities fulfill the
BMS$_{3}$ algebra. The deformation can also be described through the original
CFT$_{2}$ on a curved metric whose Beltrami differentials are determined by the
variation of the deformed Hamiltonian with respect to $T$ and $\bar{T}$.
BMS$_{3}$ symmetries then arise from deformed conformal Killing equations,
corresponding to diffeomorphisms that preserve the deformed metric and
stress-energy tensor up to local scalings. As an example, we briefly address
the deformation of $\mathrm{N}$ free bosons, which coincides with
ultra-relativistic limits only for $\mathrm{N}=1$. Furthermore, Cardy formula

corresponding BMS$_{3}$ (or flat) versions.

Standard loss functions do not cover all the needs of the environmental
sciences, which makes it important for scientists to be able to develop their

performance measures already developed in environmental science, including
measures developed for spatial model verification. However, there are very few
resources available that cover the basics of custom loss function development
comprehensively, and to the best of our knowledge none that focus on the needs

functions, common pitfalls, functions to use in loss functions, examples such
as fractions skill score as loss function, how to incorporate physical

enforce two constraints: symmetric inter-category cycle consistency and a new
asymmetric image-to-category cycle consistency. Without any manual annotations

latency requirements, people have to store multiple models and pick the best
one under the constraints. Instead, a more desirable approach is to have a
single model that can dynamically adjust its latency based on different
constraints, which we refer to as Multi-mode ASR. A Multi-mode ASR model can
fulfill various latency requirements during inference -- when a larger latency
becomes acceptable, the model can process longer future context to achieve
higher accuracy and when a latency budget is not flexible, the model can be
less dependent on future context but still achieve reliable accuracy. In
pursuit of Multi-mode ASR, we propose Stochastic Future Context, a simple
training procedure that samples one streaming configuration in each iteration.
Through extensive experiments on AISHELL-1 and LibriSpeech datasets, we show
that a Multi-mode ASR model rivals, if not surpasses, a set of competitive

(RGA) for singular and/or non-square systems has been proposed that provably
guarantees unit invariance. This property is not offered by the conventional
method that uses the Moore-Penrose (MP) pseudoinverse. In this paper we note
that the absence of the scale-invariance property by the conventional MP-RGA
does not necessarily imply a practical disadvantage in real-world applications.
In other words, while it is true that performance of a controller should not
depend on the choice of units on its input and output variables, this does not
{\em necessarily} imply that the resulting MP-RGA measures of component
interaction lead to different controller-design input-output pairings. In this
paper we consider the application of the MP-RGA to a realistic system (a Sakai
fractional distillation system) to assess whether or not the choice of unit,
which in this case relates to temperature, affects the choice of input-output
pairings determined by the resulting RGA matrix. Our results show that it does,
thus confirming that unit-sensitivity of the MP-RGA undermines its rigorous use
for MIMO controller design.

a potential beyond 5G technology. These surfaces consist of many passive
elements of metamaterials whose impedance can be controllable to change the
characteristics of wireless signals impinging on them. Channel estimation is a
critical task when it comes to the control of a large RIS when having a channel
with a large number of multipath components. In this paper, we propose novel
channel estimation schemes for different RIS-assisted massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) configurations. The proposed methods exploit spatial
correlation characteristics at both the base station and the planar RISs, and
other statistical characteristics of multi-specular fading in a mobile
environment. Moreover, a novel heuristic for phase-shift selection at the RISs
is developed. For the RIS-assisted massive MIMO, a new receive combining method
and a fixed-point algorithm, which solves the max-min fairness power control
optimally, are proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
uplink RIS-aided framework improves the spectral efficiency of the cell-edge
mobile user equipments substantially in comparison to a conventional
single-cell massive MIMO system. The impact of several channel effects are
studied to gain insight about which RIS configuration is preferable and when
the channel estimation is necessary to boost the spectral efficiency.

challenges. Firstly, because hate speech is relatively rare, random sampling of
tweets to annotate is very inefficient in finding hate speech. To address this,
prior datasets often include only tweets matching known ""hate words"". However,
restricting data to a pre-defined vocabulary may exclude portions of the
real-world phenomenon we seek to model. A second challenge is that definitions
of hate speech tend to be highly varying and subjective. Annotators having
diverse prior notions of hate speech may not only disagree with one another but
also struggle to conform to specified labeling guidelines. Our key insight is
that the rarity and subjectivity of hate speech are akin to that of relevance
in information retrieval (IR). This connection suggests that well-established
methodologies for creating IR test collections can be usefully applied to
create better benchmark datasets for hate speech. To intelligently and
efficiently select which tweets to annotate, we apply standard IR techniques of
{\em pooling} and {\em active learning}. To improve both consistency and value
of annotations, we apply {\em task decomposition} and {\em annotator rationale}
techniques. We share a new benchmark dataset for hate speech detection on
Twitter that provides broader coverage of hate than prior datasets. We also
show a dramatic drop in accuracy of existing detection models when tested on
these broader forms of hate. Annotator rationales we collect not only justify
labeling decisions but also enable future work opportunities for
dual-supervision and/or explanation generation in modeling. Further details of
our approach can be found in the supplementary materials.

However, prevailing optimization techniques are not designed for
strictly-incremental online updates. Nor are standard architectures designed
for observations with an a priori unknown structure: for example, light sensors
randomly dispersed in space. This paper proposes an online RL prediction
algorithm with an adaptive architecture that efficiently finds useful nonlinear
features. The algorithm is evaluated in a spatial domain with high-dimensional,

Arjovsky et al. [2019] to address the domain generalization problem by
leveraging data heterogeneity from differing experimental conditions.
Specifically, IRM seeks to find a data representation under which an optimal
classifier remains invariant across all domains. Despite the conceptual appeal
of IRM, the effectiveness of the originally proposed invariance penalty has
recently been brought into question. In particular, there exists
counterexamples for which that invariance penalty can be arbitrarily small for
non-invariant data representations. We propose an alternative invariance
penalty by revisiting the Gramian matrix of the data representation. We discuss
the role of its eigenvalues in the relationship between the risk and the
invariance penalty, and demonstrate that it is ill-conditioned for said
counterexamples. The proposed approach is guaranteed to recover an invariant
representation for linear settings under mild non-degeneracy conditions. Its
effectiveness is substantiated by experiments on DomainBed and

data from people who do not trust the server or other silos. In this setting,
each silo (e.g. hospital) has data from different people (e.g. patients) and
must maintain the privacy of each person's data (e.g. medical record), even if
the server or other silos act as adversarial eavesdroppers. This requirement
motivates the study of Inter-Silo Record-Level Differential Privacy (ISRL-DP),
which requires silo i's communications to satisfy record/item-level
differential privacy (DP). ISRL-DP ensures that the data of each person (e.g.
patient) in silo i (e.g. hospital i) cannot be leaked. ISRL-DP is different
from well-studied privacy notions. Central and user-level DP assume that people
trust the server/other silos. On the other end of the spectrum, local DP
assumes that people do not trust anyone at all (even their own silo). Sitting
between central and local DP, ISRL-DP makes the realistic assumption (in
cross-silo FL) that people trust their own silo, but not the server or other
silos. In this work, we provide tight (up to logarithms) upper and lower bounds
for ISRL-DP FL with convex/strongly convex loss functions and homogeneous
(i.i.d.) silo data. Remarkably, we show that similar bounds are attainable for
smooth losses with arbitrary heterogeneous silo data distributions, via an
accelerated ISRL-DP algorithm. We also provide tight upper and lower bounds for
ISRL-DP federated empirical risk minimization, and use acceleration to attain
the optimal bounds in fewer rounds of communication than the state-of-the-art.
Finally, with a secure ""shuffler"" to anonymize silo messages (but without a
trusted server), our algorithm attains the optimal central DP rates under more
practical trust assumptions. Numerical experiments show favorable
privacy-accuracy tradeoffs for our algorithm in classification and regression
tasks.

previously noted, most existing solutions are aimed at addressing the symptoms

we show that one of the causes of the problem is the accumulation of noise

Since there are no true class labels for clustering in typical unsupervised
learning, many internal cluster validity indices (CVIs), which use predicted
labels and data, have been created. Without true labels, to design an effective
CVI is as difficult as to create a clustering method. And it is crucial to have
more CVIs because there are no universal CVIs that can be used to measure all
datasets and no specific methods of selecting a proper CVI for clusters without
true labels. Therefore, to apply a variety of CVIs to evaluate clustering
results is necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel internal CVI -- the
Distance-based Separability Index (DSI), based on a data separability measure.
We compared the DSI with eight internal CVIs including studies from early Dunn
(1974) to most recent CVDD (2019) and an external CVI as ground truth, by using
clustering results of five clustering algorithms on 12 real and 97 synthetic

other compared CVIs. We also summarized the general process to evaluate CVIs

performance of neural learning. Even though constrained to using rules, LNN-EL
performs competitively against SotA black-box neural approaches, with the added
benefits of extensibility and transferability. In particular, we show that we
can easily blend existing rule templates given by a human expert, with multiple
types of features (priors, BERT encodings, box embeddings, etc), and even
scores resulting from previous EL methods, thus improving on such methods. For
instance, on the LC-QuAD-1.0 dataset, we show more than $4$\% increase in F1
score over previous SotA. Finally, we show that the inductive bias offered by
using logic results in learned rules that transfer well across datasets, even
without fine tuning, while maintaining high accuracy.

software and hardware system designers at every level of abstraction to clearly
specify and rigorously reason about the forgetting capabilities required of and
provided by a system. We identify related work that may help to illuminate

tradeoffs in implementations of forgetting capabilities. We discuss approaches
to modeling intentional forgetting and then modeling the strength of a system's
forgetting capability by its resistance to disclosing information to different
types of detectors. Research is needed in a variety of domains to advance the
theory, specification techniques, system foundations, implementation tools, and
methodologies for effective, practical forgetting. We highlight research
challenges in several domains and encourage cross-disciplinary collaboration to

polygonal oscillations. In this work, a simple model is presented that
demonstrates these oscillations and their characteristic properties. The model
consists of a spring-mass network such that the masses are analogous to liquid
molecules and the springs are to intermolecular forces. Neo-Hookean springs are
considered to represent these intermolecular forces. The restoring force of a
neo-Hookean spring depends nonlinearly on its length such that the force of a
compressed spring is much higher than the force of a spring elongated by the
same amount. This is equivalent to the incompressibility of liquids, making
these springs suitable to simulate the polygonal oscillations. It is shown that
this spring-mass network can imitate most of the characteristic features of
experimentally reported polygonal oscillations. Additionally, it is shown that
the network can execute certain dynamics which so far have not been observed in
a perturbed liquid drop. The features of dynamics which are observed in the
perturbed network are: polygonal oscillations, rotation of network, numerical
relations (rational and irrational) between the frequencies of polygonal
oscillations and the forcing signal, and the dependency of the shape of the
polygons on the parameters of perturbation.

suggests that, for theories arising from IHSs, 1-form symmetries originate from
gauge groups (with vanishing beta functions). One corollary of our discussion
is that there is no 1-form symmetry in IHS theories that have all Coulomb
branch chiral ring generators of scaling dimension less than two. In terms of
the $a$ and $c$ central charges, this condition implies that IHS theories

snow crystals can grow into faceted forms that resemble simple equilateral
triangles. Although far less common than hexagonal forms, trigonal snow
crystals have long been observed both in nature and in laboratory studies, and
their origin has been an enduring scientific puzzle. In this paper I describe
how platelike trigonal structures can be grown on the ends of slender ice
needles in air with high reliability at -14 C. I further suggest a physical
model that describes how such structures can self-assemble and develop,
facilitated by an edge-sharpening instability that turns on at a specific
combination of temperature and water-vapor supersaturation. The results
generally support a comprehensive model of structure-dependent attachment
kinetics in ice growth that has been found to explain many of the overarching
behaviors seen in the Nakaya diagram of snow crystal morphologies.

challenging due to their complex crystal structures and electron-phonon (e-ph)
interactions. Charge transport in OMCs is conventionally categorized into two
limiting regimes $-$ band transport, characterized by weak e-ph interactions,
and charge hopping due to localized polarons formed by strong e-ph
interactions. However, between these two limiting cases there is a less well
understood intermediate regime where polarons are present but transport does
not occur via hopping. Here we show a many-body first-principles approach that
can accurately predict the carrier mobility in OMCs in the intermediate regime
and shed light on its microscopic origin. Our approach combines a
finite-temperature cumulant method to describe strong e-ph interactions with
Green-Kubo transport calculations. We apply this parameter-free framework to
naphthalene crystal, demonstrating electron mobility predictions within a
factor of 1.5$-$2 of experiment between 100$-$300 K. Our analysis reveals that
electrons couple strongly with both inter- and intramolecular phonons in the
intermediate regime, as evidenced by the formation of a broad polaron satellite
peak in the electron spectral function and the failure of the Boltzmann
equation. Our study advances quantitative modeling of charge transport in
complex organic crystals.

AI. However, labeling images is time-consuming and tedious. We have recently
demonstrated that reinforcement learning (RL) can classify 2D slices of MRI
brain images with high accuracy. Here we make two important steps toward
speeding image classification: Firstly, we automatically extract class labels
from the clinical reports. Secondly, we extend our prior 2D classification work
to fully 3D image volumes from our institution. Hence, we proceed as follows:
in Part 1, we extract labels from reports automatically using the SBERT natural
language processing approach. Then, in Part 2, we use these labels with RL to
train a classification Deep-Q Network (DQN) for 3D image volumes.
  Methods: For Part 1, we trained SBERT with 90 radiology report impressions.
We then used the trained SBERT to predict class labels for use in Part 2. In
Part 2, we applied multi-step image classification to allow for combined Deep-Q
learning using 3D convolutions and TD(0) Q learning. We trained on a set of 90
images. We tested on a separate set of 61 images, again using the classes
predicted from patient reports by the trained SBERT in Part 1. For comparison,
we also trained and tested a supervised deep learning classification network on
the same set of training and testing images using the same labels.
  Results: Part 1: Upon training with the corpus of radiology reports, the
SBERT model had 100% accuracy for both normal and metastasis-containing scans.
Part 2: Then, using these labels, whereas the supervised approach quickly
overfit the training data and as expected performed poorly on the testing set
(66% accuracy, just over random guessing), the reinforcement learning approach
achieved an accuracy of 92%. The results were found to be statistically
significant, with a p-value of 3.1 x 10^-5.

KdV type equation on a hypercubic lattice, we provide a derivation of the

asymptotically expressed as the solution of the 3-wave kinetic equation at the
kinetic limit under very general assumptions: the initial condition is out of
equilibrium, the dimension is $d\ge 2$, the smallness of the nonlinearity
$\lambda$ is allowed to be independent of the size of the lattice, the weak
noise is chosen not to compete with the weak nonlinearity and not to inject
energy into the equation. Unlike the cubic nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation,
for which such a general result is commonly expected without the noise, the
kinetic description of the deterministic lattice ZK equation is unlikely to
happen. One of the key reasons is that the dispersion relation of the lattice
ZK equation leads to a singular manifold, on which not only $3$-wave
interactions but also all $m$-wave interactions ($m\ge3$) are allowed to
happen. This phenomenon has been first observed by Lukkarinen

client-side scanning mechanisms to be highly vulnerable to detection avoidance

attacked while preserving the content of the image. We furthermore show our
attack to generate diverse perturbations, strongly suggesting that
straightforward mitigation strategies would be ineffective. Finally, we show
that the larger thresholds necessary to make the attack harder would probably
require more than one billion images to be flagged and decrypted daily, raising
strong privacy concerns. Taken together, our results shed serious doubts on the

injective chromatic number of $G$ is the chromatic number of the two-step graph

vertices are adjacent if they have a common neighbor. The concept of injective
coloring has been studied by many authors, while in the present paper we
approach it from two novel perspectives, related to open packings and the
two-step graph operation. We prove several general bounds on the injective
chromatic number expressed in terms of the open packing number. In particular,
we prove that $\chi_{i}(G)\geq
\frac{1}{2}+\sqrt{\frac{1}{4}+\frac{2m-n}{\opack}}$ holds for any connected
graph $G$ of order $n\geq2$, size $m$, and the open packing number $\opack$,
and characterize the class of graphs attaining the bound. Regarding the
well-known bound $\chi_i(G)\ge \Delta(G)$, we describe the family of extremal
graphs and prove that deciding when the equality holds (even for regular
graphs) is NP-complete, solving an open problem from an earlier paper. Next, we
consider the chromatic number of the two-step graph of a graph, and compare it
with the clique number and the maximum degree of the graph. We present two
large families of graphs in which $\chi_i(G)$ equals the cardinality of a
largest clique of the two-step graph of $G$. Finally, we consider classes of
graphs that admit an injective coloring in which all color classes are maximal
open packings. We give characterizations of three subclasses of these graphs

the quantum walker system to perform a distributed CNOT operation, which shows
the universality of the protocol for distributed quantum computing.

harm may manifest as a gradual degradation of public discourse; but it can also
take the form of sudden dramatic events such as the 2021 insurrection on
Capitol Hill. The platforms themselves are in the best position to prevent the
spread of disinformation, as they have the best access to relevant data and the
expertise to use it. However, mitigating disinformation is costly, not only for
implementing detection algorithms or employing manual effort, but also because
limiting such highly viral content impacts user engagement and potential
advertising revenue. Since the costs of harmful content are borne by other
entities, the platform will therefore have no incentive to exercise the
socially-optimal level of effort. This problem is similar to that of
environmental regulation, in which the costs of adverse events are not directly
borne by a firm, the mitigation effort of a firm is not observable, and the
causal link between a harmful consequence and a specific failure is difficult
to prove. For environmental regulation, one solution is to perform costly
monitoring to ensure that the firm takes adequate precautions according to a
specified rule. However, a fixed rule for classifying disinformation becomes
less effective over time, as bad actors can learn to sequentially and
strategically bypass it. Encoding our domain as a Markov decision process, we
demonstrate that no penalty based on a static rule, no matter how large, can
incentivize optimal effort. Penalties based on an adaptive rule can incentivize
optimal effort, but counter-intuitively, only if the regulator sufficiently
overreacts to harmful events by requiring a greater-than-optimal level of
effort. We offer novel insights for the effective regulation of social
platforms, highlight inherent challenges, and discuss promising avenues for

quantify the uncertainty of model predictions. Conveying uncertainty is
especially important when there are changes to the underlying data distribution
that might invalidate the predictive model. Yet, most existing uncertainty
quantification algorithms break down in the presence of such shifts. We propose
a novel approach that addresses this challenge by constructing \emph{probably
approximately correct (PAC)} prediction sets in the presence of covariate
shift. Our approach focuses on the setting where there is a covariate shift
from the source distribution (where we have labeled training examples) to the
target distribution (for which we want to quantify uncertainty). Our algorithm
assumes given importance weights that encode how the probabilities of the
training examples change under the covariate shift. In practice, importance
weights typically need to be estimated; thus, we extend our algorithm to the
setting where we are given confidence intervals for the importance weights. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on covariate shifts based on
DomainNet and ImageNet. Our algorithm satisfies the PAC constraint, and gives
prediction sets with the smallest average normalized size among approaches that
always satisfy the PAC constraint.

play crucial roles in 5G networks for dynamically provisioning diverse
communication services with heterogeneous service requirements. In particular,
while NFV improves flexibility and scalability by softwarizing physical network
functions as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), MEC enables to provide
delay-sensitive/time-critical services by moving computing facilities to the
network edge. However, these new paradigms introduce challenges in terms of
latency, availability, and resource allocation. In this paper, we first explore
MEC cloud facility location selection and then latency-aware placement of VNFs
in different selected locations of NFV enabled MEC cloud facilities in order to
meet the ultra-low latency requirements of different applications (e.g.,
Tactile Internet, virtual reality, and mission-critical applications).
Furthermore, we also aim to guarantee the survivability of VNFs and an edge
server against failures in resource limited MEC cloud facility due to software
bugs, configuration faults, etc. To this end, we formulate the problem of
latency-aware and survivable mapping of VNFs in different MEC cloud facilities
as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to minimize the overall service
provisioning cost, and show that the problem is NP-hard. Owing to the high
computational complexity of solving the ILP, we propose a simulated annealing
based heuristic algorithm to obtain near-optimal solution in polynomial time.
With extensive simulations, we show the effectiveness of our proposed solution
in a real-world network topology, which performs close to the optimal solution.

logic of evidence and truth $LET_{F}$, together with a corresponding sound and
complete first-order non-deterministic valuation semantics. $LET_{F}$ is a
paraconsistent and paracomplete sentential logic that extends the logic of
first-degree entailment ($FDE$) with a classicality operator ${\circ}$ and a
non-classicality operator $\bullet$, dual to each other: while ${\circ} A$
entails that $A$ behaves classically, ${\bullet} A$ follows from $A$'s
violating some classically valid inferences. The semantics of $QLET_{F}$
combines structures that interpret negated predicates in terms of
anti-extensions with first-order non-deterministic valuations, and completeness
is obtained through a generalization of Henkin's method. By providing sound and
complete semantics for first-order extensions of $FDE$, $K3$, and $LP$, we show
how these tools, which we call here the method of ``anti-extensions +
valuations'', can be naturally applied to a number of non-classical logics.

fitted by an underdense corrugated sheet model, and look for associated
variability in the pulse profile using principal component analysis. We find
that there are transient pulse profile variations, but they vary in concert
with the dispersion measure, unlike what is expected from lensing due to a
corrugated sheet. The change is consistent in shape across profiles from both
the Greenbank and Arecibo radio observatories, and its amplitude appears to be
achromatic across the 820-MHz, 1.4-GHz, and 2.3-GHz bands, again unlike
expected from interference between lensed images. This result is puzzling. We
note that some of the predicted lensing effects would need higher time and
frequency resolution data than used in this analysis. Future events appear
likely, and storing baseband data or keeping multiple time-frequency
resolutions will allow more in-depth study of propagation effects and hence
improvements to pulsar timing accuracy.

we do so for the mode functions and correlation functions for the external

identify its domain of validity. We also show how renormalization-group EFT

sparsification can reduce the computation and memory cost while maintaining
model quality. Most existing sparsification algorithms unidirectionally remove
weights, while others randomly or greedily explore a small subset of weights in
each layer for pruning. The limitations of these algorithms reduce the level of
achievable sparsity. In addition, many algorithms still require pre-trained
dense models and thus suffer from large memory footprint. In this paper, we
propose a novel scheduled grow-and-prune (GaP) methodology without having to
pre-train a dense model. It addresses the shortcomings of the previous works by
repeatedly growing a subset of layers to dense and then pruning them back to
sparse after some training. Experiments show that the models pruned using the
proposed methods match or beat the quality of the highly optimized dense models
at 80% sparsity on a variety of tasks, such as image classification, objective
detection, 3D object part segmentation, and translation. They also outperform

millisecond burst of sufficient power can be generated by synchrotron maser
emission ignited at the reverse shock propagating through the weakly magnetized
material that forms the magnetar flare. If the maser emission is generated in
an anisotropic regime (due to the geometry of the production region or presence
of an intense external source of stimulating photons) the duration of the maser
flashes is similar to the magnetar flare duration even if the shock front
radius is large. Our scenario allows relaxing the requirements for several key
parameters: the magnetic field strength at the production site, luminosity of
the flare, and the production site bulk Lorentz factor. To check the
feasibility of this model, we study the statistical relation between powerful
magnetar flares and the rate of FRBs. The expected ratio is derived by
convoluting the redshift-dependent magnetar density with their flare luminosity
function above the energy limit determined by the FRB detection threshold. We
obtain that only a small fraction, $\sim10^{-5}$, of powerful magnetar flares
trigger FRBs. This ratio agrees surprisingly well with our estimates: we
obtained that $10\%$ of magnetars should be in the evolutionary phase suitable
for the production of FRBs, and only $10^{-4}$ of all flares are expected to be
weakly magnetized, which is a necessary condition for the high-frequency maser
emission.

than the point-spread function of KM2A. The measured energy spectrum from 20 to
200 TeV can be approximately described by a power-law function with an index of

a single iterative process (one-phase TAR workflows) or whether model training
and review should be separate (two-phase TAR workflows), with implications for
the choice of active learning algorithm. The relative cost of manual labeling
for different purposes (training vs. review) and of different documents
(positive vs. negative examples) is a key and neglected factor in this debate.
Using a novel cost dynamics analysis, we show analytically and empirically that
these relative costs strongly impact whether a one-phase or two-phase workflow

with a fluorite-type H-Be alloy backbone, is predicted to be metastable and
superconducting with a Tc ~ 191 K at 50 GPa; a substantially lower pressure

  Uncertainty","Jounal version of our MICCAI 2021 paper, in review",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is difficult to accurately label ambiguous and complex shaped targets
manually by binary masks. The weakness of binary mask under-expression is
highlighted in medical image segmentation, where blurring is prevalent. In the
case of multiple annotations, reaching a consensus for clinicians by binary
masks is more challenging. Moreover, these uncertain areas are related to the
lesions' structure and may contain anatomical information beneficial to
diagnosis. However, current studies on uncertainty mainly focus on the
uncertainty in model training and data labels. None of them investigate the
influence of the ambiguous nature of the lesion itself.Inspired by image
matting, this paper introduces alpha matte as a soft mask to represent
uncertain areas in medical scenes and accordingly puts forward a new
uncertainty quantification method to fill the gap of uncertainty research for
lesion structure. In this work, we introduce a new architecture to generate
binary masks and alpha mattes in a multitasking framework, which outperforms
all state-of-the-art matting algorithms compared. The proposed uncertainty map
is able to highlight the ambiguous regions and a novel multitasking loss
weighting strategy we presented can improve performance further and demonstrate
their concrete benefits. To fully-evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed
method, we first labelled three medical datasets with alpha matte to address
the shortage of available matting datasets in medical scenes and prove the
alpha matte to be a more efficient labeling method than a binary mask from both
qualitative and quantitative aspects.

We are focused on ideas and methods which can be used explicitly for practical

  We prove that for a variety X we can obtain K-theoretic stable envelopes for
the variety X^G of the G-fixed points of X, where G is a cyclic group acting on
X preserving the symplectic form.
  We formalize the notion of symplectic duality, also known as 3-dimensional
mirror symmetry. We obtain a factorization theorem about the limit of elliptic
stable envelopes to a wall, which generalizes the result of M.Aganagic and
A.Okounkov. This approach allows us to extend the action of quantum groups,
quantum Weyl groups, R-matrices etc., to actions on the K-theory of the
symplectic dual variety. In the case of the Hilbert scheme of points in plane,
our results imply the conjectures of E.Gorsky and A.Negut.

such attacks have primarily targeted visual models, exploiting the gap between
human and machine perception. Although text-based models have also been
attacked with adversarial examples, such attacks struggled to preserve semantic
meaning and indistinguishability. In this paper, we explore a large class of
adversarial examples that can be used to attack text-based models in a
black-box setting without making any human-perceptible visual modification to
inputs. We use encoding-specific perturbations that are imperceptible to the
human eye to manipulate the outputs of a wide range of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) systems from neural machine-translation pipelines to web
search engines. We find that with a single imperceptible encoding injection --
representing one invisible character, homoglyph, reordering, or deletion -- an
attacker can significantly reduce the performance of vulnerable models, and
with three injections most models can be functionally broken. Our attacks work
against currently-deployed commercial systems, including those produced by
Microsoft and Google, in addition to open source models published by Facebook,
IBM, and HuggingFace. This novel series of attacks presents a significant
threat to many language processing systems: an attacker can affect systems in a
targeted manner without any assumptions about the underlying model. We conclude
that text-based NLP systems require careful input sanitization, just like
conventional applications, and that given such systems are now being deployed
rapidly at scale, the urgent attention of architects and operators is required.

impossible to predict electrical characteristics of SiC CMOS logic gates in a

sensor with sampling and quantization has been recorded. This paper, for the
first time, introduces an optical adversarial attack, which physically alters
the light field information arriving at the image sensor so that the
classification model yields misclassification. More specifically, we modulate
the phase of the light in the Fourier domain using a spatial light modulator
placed in the photographic system. The operative parameters of the modulator
are obtained by gradient-based optimization to maximize cross-entropy and
minimize distortions. We present experiments based on both simulation and a
real hardware optical system, from which the feasibility of the proposed
optical attack is demonstrated. It is also verified that the proposed attack is
completely different from common optical-domain distortions such as spherical
aberration, defocus, and astigmatism in terms of both perturbation patterns and
classification results.

$\sim$1/50 Z$_\odot$, an initial rotational velocity of 600 km s$^{-1}$, and
experiences chemically homogeneous evolution. It has a silicon- and oxygen-rich
(Si/O) convective layer at (4.7-17)$\times 10^{8}$ cm, where oxygen-shell
burning takes place. The power spectrum analysis of the turbulent velocity
indicates the dominance of the large-scale mode ($\ell \sim 3$), which has also
been seen in non-rotating stars that have a wide Si/O layer. Spiral arm
structures of density and silicon-enriched material produced by oxygen-shell
burning appear in the equatorial plane of the Si/O shell. Non-axisymmetric,
large-scale ($m \le 3$) modes are dominant in these structures. The spiral arm
structures have not been identified in previous non-rotating 3D pre-supernova
models. Governed by such a convection pattern, the angle-averaged specific
angular momentum becomes constant in the Si/O convective layer, which is not
considered in spherically symmetrical stellar evolution models. Such spiral
arms and constant specific angular momentum might affect the ensuing explosion

(MPGCNs), have been a powerful tool in representation learning of networked
data. However, when data is heterogeneous, most architectures are limited as
they employ a single strategy to handle multi-channel graph signals and they
typically focus on low-frequency information. In this paper, we present a novel
graph convolution operator, termed BankGCN, which keeps benefits of message
passing models, but extends their capabilities beyond `low-pass' features. It
decomposes multi-channel signals on graphs into subspaces and handles
particular information in each subspace with an adapted filter. The filters of
all subspaces have different frequency responses and together form a filter
bank. Furthermore, each filter in the spectral domain corresponds to a message
passing scheme, and diverse schemes are implemented via the filter bank.
Importantly, the filter bank and the signal decomposition are jointly learned
to adapt to the spectral characteristics of data and to target applications.
Furthermore, this is implemented almost without extra parameters in comparison
with most existing MPGCNs. Experimental results show that the proposed
convolution operator permits to achieve excellent performance in graph
classification on a collection of benchmark graph datasets.

nearby latent vectors to data with semantic similarities, than across separate
categories. We use generated data samples and their corresponding artificial
conditioning labels to train a classifier. The classifier is then used to
self-label real data. To boost the accuracy of the self-labeling, we also use
the exponential moving average of the classifier. However, because the
classifier might still make mistakes, especially at the beginning of the
training, we also refine the labels through self-attention, by using the
labeling of real data samples only when the classifier outputs a high
classification probability score. We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10, STL-10

improve the quality of generated data. More surprisingly, we find that the

of genome rearrangement, most are tied to a particular set of genomic modelling
assumptions and to a restricted class of allowed rearrangements. The ""position
paradigm"", in which genomes are represented as permutations signifying the
position (and orientation) of each region, enables a refined model-based
approach, where one can select biologically plausible rearrangements and assign
to them relative probabilities/costs. Here, one must further incorporate any
underlying structural symmetry of the genomes into the calculations and ensure
that this symmetry is reflected in the model. In our recently-introduced
framework of {\em genome algebras}, each genome corresponds to an element that
simultaneously incorporates all of its inherent physical symmetries. The
representation theory of these algebras then provides a natural model of
evolution via rearrangement as a Markov chain. Whilst the implementation of
this framework to calculate distances for genomes with `practical' numbers of
regions is currently computationally infeasible, we consider it to be a
significant theoretical advance: one can incorporate different genomic
modelling assumptions, calculate various genomic distances, and compare the

crisis management before or during a pandemic outbreak. Detecting people's
concerns and attention from online social media platforms has been widely
acknowledged as an effective approach to relieve public panic and prevent a
social crisis. However, detecting concerns in time from massive information in
social media turns out to be a big challenge, especially when sufficient
manually labeled data is in the absence of public health emergencies, e.g.,
COVID-19. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning model to
identify people's concerns and the corresponding relations based on Graph
Convolutional Network and Bi-directional Long Short Term Memory integrated with
Concern Graph. Except for the sequential features from BERT embeddings, the
regional features of tweets can be extracted by the Concern Graph module, which
not only benefits the concern detection but also enables our model to be high
noise-tolerant. Thus, our model can address the issue of insufficient manually
labeled data. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed model
by using both manually labeled tweets and automatically labeled tweets. The
experimental results show that our model can outperform the state-of-art models
on real-world datasets.

proposing six novel indicators of failure, to automatically detect the presence

limitations of Eliashberg - McMillan theory as the main theory describing
superconductivity in a system of electrons and phonons. Below we shall consider
both elementary basics of this theory and a number of new results derived only
recently. We shall discuss limitations on the value of the coupling constant
related to lattice instability and a phase transition to another phase (CDW,
bipolarons). Within the stable metallic phase the effective pairing constant
may acquire arbitrary values. We consider extensions beyond the traditional
adiabatic approximation. It is shown that Eliasberg - McMillan theory is also
applicable in the strong antiadiabatic limit. The limit of very strong
coupling, being most relevant for the physics of hydrides, is analyzed in
details. We also discuss the bounds for $T_c$ appearing in this limit.

learning technique like feed-forward neural networks (FFNN) or extreme learning
machines (ELM). However, the performance of any of these modelling techniques
can be deteriorated by the unexpected rise of non-stationarities in the dynamic
environment in which industrial assets operate. This unpredictable statistical
change in the measured variable is known as concept drift. In this article a
wind turbine maintenance case is presented, where non-stationarities of various
kinds can happen unexpectedly. Such concept drift events are desired to be
detected by means of statistical detectors and window-based approaches.
However, in real complex systems, concept drifts are not as clear and evident
as in artificially generated datasets. In order to evaluate the effectiveness
of current drift detectors and also to design an appropriate novel technique
for this specific industrial application, it is essential to dispose beforehand
of a characterization of the existent drifts. Under the lack of information in
this regard, a methodology for labelling concept drift events in the lifetime
of wind turbines is proposed. This methodology will facilitate the creation of
a drift database that will serve both as a training ground for concept drift
detectors and as a valuable information to enhance the knowledge about

confirm that differences in pore structure topology impact transport parameters

revealed, which involves many coupled processes including the morphology

the final fate of this liquid bridge, we observe that the breakup occurs once
an effective length ($\tilde{L}$) is reached. This effective length increases
linearly with the applied voltage, implying a threshold electric field to
sustain the liquid bridge. Moreover, by an introduced external flow, the
lifetime of the liquid bridge can be controlled, while the effective length
associated with the breakup is independent on the external flow rate. Hence,
these findings remarkably demonstrate that the breakup of liquid bridge is
directly correlated with the effective length. In order to understand this
correlation, a simplified model of an electrified jet is employed to take the
electric field into account. By the linear stability analysis, the attained

waves confined to the edge of a thin ferromagnetic film with the spin-wave beam
incident at this edge. We found the inelastically scattered spin-wave beams at
frequencies increased and decreased by the frequency of the edge spin-wave
relative to the specularly reflected beam. We observed a strong dependence of
the angular shift of the inelastic scattered spin-wave beam on the edge-mode
frequency, which allowed us to propose a magnonic demultiplexing of the signal

this process, this indicates the possibility of implementing the presented

Using a single actuator, the proposed gripper realizes two grasping modes:
parallel-grip and turn-over modes. The gripper's mode can be switched via
contact with a flat surface, such as a table. Handling thin thicknesses and
light weights are the key challenges faced in attempts to grasp small-sized
items. Although parallel grippers are effective in handling small items, there
is a limit to the thinness of objects that can be grasped by parallel grippers.
Accordingly, the turn-over mode was adopted to grasp items that exceeded this
threshold. In the turn-over mode, one finger lifts the item, while another
finger holds the item from above to keep it from flicking out. The proposed
gripper is capable of picking up several types of items from a table, including
thin (0.05 mm) and lightweight (0.007 g) items.

differs from the learned training distribution. Previous methods attempt to
learn the representation of the normal samples via generative adversarial
networks (GANs). However, they will suffer from instability training, mode
dropping, and low discriminative ability. Recently, various pretext tasks (e.g.
rotation prediction and clustering) have been proposed for self-supervised
learning in novelty detection. However, the learned latent features are still
low discriminative. We overcome such problems by introducing a novel
decoder-encoder framework. Firstly, a generative network (a.k.a. decoder)
learns the representation by mapping the initialized latent vector to an image.
In particular, this vector is initialized by considering the entire
distribution of training data to avoid the problem of mode-dropping. Secondly,
a contrastive network (a.k.a. encoder) aims to ``learn to compare'' through
mutual information estimation, which directly helps the generative network to
obtain a more discriminative representation by using a negative data
augmentation strategy. Extensive experiments show that our model has
significant superiority over cutting-edge novelty detectors and achieves new
state-of-the-art results on some novelty detection benchmarks, e.g. CIFAR10 and
DCASE. Moreover, our model is more stable for training in a non-adversarial
manner, compared to other adversarial based novelty detection methods.

divides the memory into a secure Keystone private memory and an unsecure

memory to execute securely. Simple demand paging in Keystone ends up leaking
sensitive access patterns of Keystone application to the Operating System(OS),
that is assumed to be malicious. This is because, to access the unsecure
non-Keystone memory, Keystone needs support of the OS. To mitigate this,
Keystone needs to implement oblivious demand paging while obfuscating its page
access patterns by using Oblivious RAM(ORAM) techniques. This causes
substantial slowdown in the application execution.
  In this paper, we bridge the performance gap between application execution
time with unsecure and secure demand paging in Keystone by using Deterministic,
stash free, Write only ORAM (DetWoORAM) for oblivious demand paging. We also
show why DetWoORAM, that is a write-only ORAM, is sufficient for oblivious

holding area. The actual pages are stored in main area. We propose two
enhancements over DetWoORAM that improves the application execution slowdown.
The first enhancement, which we call the Eager DetWoORAM, involves page
preloading that exploits the deterministic access pattern of DetWoORAM, and
tries to hide the ORAM latency. The second enhancement, which we call the
Parallel DetWoORAM, involves spawning multiple threads and each thread performs
a part of the DetWoORAM memory access algorithm. Compared to DetWoORAM that
shows slowdown of [1.4x, 2x, and 3.24x], Eager DetWoORAM and Parallel DetWoORAM

proton beams that induce the electron return current. The injection of the beam
protons can be interpreted as an external force acting on the downstream proton
plasma. We show that the effective external force and the electron return

magnetic field strength is estimated to be $B\sim 10^{-14}-10^{-11}~{\rm G}$,
where the characteristic lengthscale is the mean free path of charge exchange,

generated magnetic field in the downstream region, the magnetic field could be
amplified to larger values and stretched to larger scales by turbulent dynamo
and expansion.

the overwhelming intrinsic clustering in the observed galaxy distribution. In
this paper, we modify the Internal Linear Combination (ILC) method to
reconstruct the lensing signal with an extra constraint to suppress the
intrinsic clustering. To quantify the performance, we construct a realistic
galaxy catalogue for the LSST-like photometric survey, covering $20\,000\
\deg^2$ with mean source redshift at $z_s\sim 1$. We find that the
reconstruction performance depends on the width of the photo-z bin we choose.
Due to the correlation between the lensing signal and the source galaxy
distribution, the derived signal has smaller systematic bias but larger
statistical uncertainty for a narrower photo-z bin. We conclude that the
lensing signal reconstruction with the Modified ILC method is unbiased with a
statistical uncertainty $<5\%$ for bin width $\Delta z^P = 0.2$.

risky and thus data are often collected passively. While in simple cases, such
as in bandits, passive and active data collection are similarly effective, the
price of passive sampling can be much higher when collecting data from a system
with controlled states. The main focus of the current paper is the
characterization of this price. For example, when learning in episodic finite
state-action Markov decision processes (MDPs) with $\mathrm{S}$ states and
$\mathrm{A}$ actions, we show that even with the best (but passively chosen)
logging policy, $\Omega(\mathrm{A}^{\min(\mathrm{S}-1, H)}/\varepsilon^2)$

little surprising. We also extend these results in various directions, such as
other criteria or learning in the presence of function approximation, with
similar conclusions. A remarkable feature of our result is the sharp
characterization of the exponent that appears, which is critical for

significant constraints on the computational complexity of the applied
algorithms for on-device execution.
  In this work, we consider document location in an image without prior
knowledge of the document content or its internal structure. In accordance with
the published works, at least 5 systems offer solutions for on-device document
location. All these systems use a location method which can be considered
Hough-based. The precision of such systems seems to be lower than that of the
state-of-the-art solutions which were not designed to account for the limited
computational resources.
  We propose an advanced Hough-based method. In contrast with other approaches,
it accounts for the geometric invariants of the central projection model and
combines both edge and color features for document boundary detection. The
proposed method allowed for the second best result for SmartDoc dataset in
terms of precision, surpassed by U-net like neural network. When evaluated on a
more challenging MIDV-500 dataset, the proposed algorithm guaranteed the best
precision compared to published methods. Our method retained the applicability
to on-device computations.

  Detection","Accepted to ICDE 2022",,,,"cs.LG cs.CR","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Graph-based Anomaly Detection (GAD) is becoming prevalent due to the powerful
representation abilities of graphs as well as recent advances in graph mining
techniques. These GAD tools, however, expose a new attacking surface,
ironically due to their unique advantage of being able to exploit the relations
among data. That is, attackers now can manipulate those relations (i.e., the
structure of the graph) to allow some target nodes to evade detection. In this
paper, we exploit this vulnerability by designing a new type of targeted
structural poisoning attacks to a representative regression-based GAD system
termed OddBall. Specially, we formulate the attack against OddBall as a
bi-level optimization problem, where the key technical challenge is to
efficiently solve the problem in a discrete domain. We propose a novel attack
method termed BinarizedAttack based on gradient descent. Comparing to prior
arts, BinarizedAttack can better use the gradient information, making it
particularly suitable for solving combinatorial optimization problems.
Furthermore, we investigate the attack transferability of BinarizedAttack by
employing it to attack other representation-learning-based GAD systems. Our
comprehensive experiments demonstrate that BinarizedAttack is very effective in
enabling target nodes to evade graph-based anomaly detection tools with limited
attackers' budget, and in the black-box transfer attack setting,
BinarizedAttack is also tested effective and in particular, can significantly
change the node embeddings learned by the GAD systems. Our research thus opens
the door to studying a new type of attack against security analytic tools that
rely on graph data.

Microarchitecture-level simulators have become the most commonly used tools for

microarchitectural simulators are becoming more and more crucial for
researchers and microprocessor architects. One of the most critical aspects of
a microarchitectural simulator is its ability to accurately express design
standards as various aspects of the microarchitecture change during design
refinement. On the other hand, modern microprocessor models rely on dedicated
hardware implementations, making the design space exploration a time-consuming
process that can be performed using a variety of methods, ranging from
high-level models to hardware prototyping. Therefore, the tradeoff between

the order of feeding these poisoned batches into the model is stochastic. In

poison each data batch according to the current model state. In this paper, we
focus on the real-time settings and propose a new attacking strategy, which
affiliates an accumulative phase with poisoning attacks to secretly (i.e.,
without affecting accuracy) magnify the destructive effect of a (poisoned)

metallic lines being in agreement. We propose a method of using empirical
relations between Teff, log g and line-depth ratios, for which we meticulously
select pairs of FeI and FeII lines and pairs of CaI and CaII lines. Based on
YJ-band (0.97-1.32 micron) high-resolution spectra of 42 FGK stars (dwarfs to
supergiants), we selected five FeI-FeII and four CaI-CaII line pairs together
with 13 FeI-FeI pairs (for estimating Teff, and derived the empirical
relations. Using such relations does not require complex numerical models and
tools for estimating chemical abundances. The relations we present allows one
to derive Teff and log g with a precision of around 50 K and 0.2 dex,
respectively, but the achievable accuracy depends on the accuracy of the
calibrators' stellar parameters. It is essential to revise the calibration by
observing stars with accurate stellar parameters available, e.g., stars with
asteroseismic log g and stars analyzed with complete stellar models taking into
account the effects of non-local thermodynamic equilibrium and convection. In
addition, the calibrators we used have a limited metallicity range, [Fe/H]

tubes to detect photons from a liquid scintillator. The large PMTs are
sensitive and easily affected such that the detection efficiency loses about
60$\%$ under the geomagnetic field intensity ($\sim$500 mG). It has a
significantly negative effect on the detector performance, and a compensation
system is necessary for geomagnetic field shielding. As permalloys are easily
rusted in water, a better way for the geomagnetic shielding is to apply an
active compensation coils system. The simulations show that a set of 32
circular coils can meet the experiment requirement. The residual magnetic field
is less than 0.05 G in the Central Detector Photomultiplier Tube (CD-PMT)

number of recurrent, convolutional, or feed-forward layers in order to obtain
high-quality continuous space representations which in turn improves the
quality of the network's prediction. Conventionally, each layer in the stack
has its own parameters which leads to a significant increase in the number of
model parameters. In this paper, we propose to share parameters across all
layers thereby leading to a recurrently stacked neural network model. We report
on an extensive case study on neural machine translation (NMT), where we apply
our proposed method to an encoder-decoder based neural network model, i.e., the
Transformer model, and experiment with three Japanese--English translation
datasets. We empirically demonstrate that the translation quality of a model
that recurrently stacks a single layer 6 times, despite having significantly
fewer parameters, approaches that of a model that stacks 6 layers where each
layer has different parameters. We also explore the limits of recurrent
stacking where we train extremely deep NMT models. This paper also examines the
utility of our recurrently stacked model as a student model through transfer
learning via leveraging pre-trained parameters and knowledge distillation, and
shows that it compensates for the performance drops in translation quality that
the direct training of recurrently stacked model brings. We also show how
transfer learning helps in faster decoding on top of the already reduced number
of parameters due to recurrent stacking. Finally, we analyze the effects of
recurrently stacked layers by visualizing the attentions of models that use
recurrently stacked layers and models that do not.

when the trained TTS tries to transfer the speech to a target style from a new
speaker with an unknown, arbitrary style. In this paper, we propose a new
approach to style transfer for both seen and unseen styles, with disjoint,
multi-style datasets, i.e., datasets of different styles are recorded, each
individual style is by one speaker with multiple utterances. To encode the
style information, we adopt an inverse autoregressive flow (IAF) structure to
improve the variational inference. The whole system is optimized to minimize a
weighed sum of four different loss functions: 1) a reconstruction loss to
measure the distortions in both source and target reconstructions; 2) an
adversarial loss to ""fool"" a well-trained discriminator; 3) a style distortion
loss to measure the expected style loss after the transfer; 4) a cycle
consistency loss to preserve the speaker identity of the source after the
transfer. Experiments demonstrate, both objectively and subjectively, the
effectiveness of the proposed approach for seen and unseen style transfer
tasks. The performance of the new approach is better and more robust than those

the sloshing liquid. Physical experiments are carried out on a scaled S-WEC
model to validate the mathematical and numerical methodologies. Natural
frequencies of the S-WEC system are first investigated through spectrum
analyses on motion histories of the buoy and sloshing liquid. The viscous
damping strength is identified through comparisons with experimental
measurements. Effects of the PTO damping on power generation characteristics of
S-WEC is further explored. An optimal PTO damping can be found for each
excitation frequency, leading to the maximisation of both the power generation
and conversion efficiency of the buoy. To determine a constant PTO damping for
engineering design, a practical approach based on diagram analyses is proposed.
Effects of the buoy's geometry on power generation characteristics of the S-WEC
are also investigated. In engineering practice, the present design of S-WEC can
be a promising technical solution of ocean wave energy harvesting, based on its
comprehensive advantages on survivability enhancement, metal corrosion or
fouling organism inhibition, power generation stability and efficiency, and so

consumption. In this context, device-to-device (D2D) paradigm has a utilitarian

the aim of realizing network-wide energy improvements. To this end, we study
multimedia caching in cellular D2D networks and propose an energy prioritized
D2D caching (EPDC) algorithm in this work. We also investigate the optimal
caching policy in that system setting. The impact of device capacity and D2D
transmission range on energy consumption is studied by focusing on different
operation modes such as D2D and base station transmissions. According to the
simulation results, EPDC algorithm has substantial energy-efficiency gains over

shown that this model can be considered as a particular case of the classical
compound Binomial model. As far as we work with parallel Binomial counting
processes in infinite time, if we consider them as independent, the probability
of the event they to have at least once simultaneous jumps would be equal to
one. We overcome this problem by using thinning instead of convolution
operation. The bivariate claim counting processes are expressed in two
different ways. The characteristics of the total claim amount processes are
derived. The risk reserve process and the probabilities of ruin are discussed.
The deficit at ruin is thoroughly investigated when the initial capital is
zero. Its mean, probability mass function and probability generating function
are obtained. We show that although the probability generating function of the
global maxima of the random walk is uniquely determined via its probability
mass function and vice versa, any compound geometric distribution with
non-negative summands has uncountably many stochastically equivalent compound
geometric presentations. The probability to survive in much more general

high accuracy. However, these methods need dense depth supervision and suffer
from inferior speed. To solve these two issues, a recently introduced RTS3D
builds an efficient 4D Feature-Consistency Embedding (FCE) space for the
intermediate representation of object without depth supervision. FCE space
splits the entire object region into 3D uniform grid latent space for feature
sampling point generation, which ignores the importance of different object
regions. However, we argue that, compared with the inner region, the outer
region plays a more important role for accurate 3D detection. To encode more
information from the outer region, we propose a shape prior non-uniform
sampling strategy that performs dense sampling in outer region and sparse
sampling in inner region. As a result, more points are sampled from the outer

enhance the feature discrimination of each sampling point, we propose a
high-level semantic enhanced FCE module to exploit more contextual information

show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with the baseline

chemical characteristics at near-atomic scale. Using APT data sets, we present
here a machine-learning-based approach for the automated quantification of
chemical features of GBs. We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) using
twenty thousand synthesized images of grain interiors, GBs, or triple
junctions. Such a trained CNN automatically detects the locations of GBs from
APT data. Those GBs are then subjected to compositional mapping and analysis,
including revealing their in-plane chemical decoration patterns. We applied
this approach to experimentally obtained APT data sets pertaining to three case
studies, namely, Ni-P, Pt-Au, and Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys. In the first case, we
extracted GB-specific segregation features as a function of misorientation and
coincidence site lattice character. Secondly, we revealed interfacial excesses
and in-plane chemical features that could not have been found by standard
compositional analyses. Lastly, we tracked the temporal evolution of chemical
decoration from early-stage solute GB segregation in the dilute limit to
interfacial phase separation, characterized by the evolution of complex
composition patterns. This machine-learning-based approach provides
quantitative, unbiased, and automated access to GB chemical analyses, serving
as an enabling tool for new discoveries related to interface thermodynamics,
kinetics, and the associated chemistry-structure-property relations.

future quantum communication systems and networks beyond today's imagination.
As a significant application of barcoding photons, we introduce code division
multiple-access (CDMA) communication systems for various applications. In this
context, we introduce and discuss the fundamental principles of a novel quantum
CDMA (QCDMA) technique based on spectrally encoding and decoding of
continuous-mode quantum light pulses. In particular, we present the
mathematical models of various QCDMA modules that are fundamental in describing
an ideal and typical QCDMA system, such as quantum signal sources, quantum
spectral encoding phase operators, M$\times$M quantum broadcasting
star-coupler, quantum spectral phase decoding operators, and the quantum
receivers. In describing a QCDMA system, this paper considers a unified
approach where the input continuous-mode quantum light pulses can take on any
form of pure states such as Glauber states and quantum number states. For input
number states, one can observe features like entanglement and quantum
interference. More interestingly, due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle,
the quantum signals sent by photon number states obtain complete phase
uncertainty at the time of measurement. Therefore, at the receiver output, the
multiaccess inter-signal interference vanishes. Due to Heisenberg's uncertainty
principle, the received signal intensity at the photodetector's output changes
from a coherent detection scheme for input Glauber states to an incoherent
detection scheme for input number states. Our mathematical model is valuable in
the signal design and data modulations of point-to-point quantum
communications, quantum pulse shaping, and quantum radar signals and systems
where the inputs are continuous mode quantum signals.

equivalent to a novel type of Cover and Ordentlich 1996 universal portfolio

structure of instantaneous asset returns. Say, if there is some dispersion in
the volatilities of the available assets, then the uniform (or Dirichlet)

computer vision, computer graphics, and robotics. In this paper, we study a
fundamental problem in this context about recovering a surface mesh from an
implicit field function whose zero-level set captures the underlying surface.
To achieve the goal, existing methods rely on traditional meshing algorithms;
while promising, they suffer from loss of precision learned in the implicit
surface networks, due to the use of discrete space sampling in marching cubes.
Given that an MLP with activations of Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) partitions
its input space into a number of linear regions, we are motivated to connect
this local linearity with a same property owned by the desired result of
polygon mesh. More specifically, we identify from the linear regions,
partitioned by an MLP based implicit function, the analytic cells and analytic
faces that are associated with the function's zero-level isosurface. We prove
that under mild conditions, the identified analytic faces are guaranteed to
connect and form a closed, piecewise planar surface. Based on the theorem, we
propose an algorithm of analytic marching, which marches among analytic cells
to exactly recover the mesh captured by an implicit surface network. We also
show that our theory and algorithm are equally applicable to advanced MLPs with
shortcut connections and max pooling. Given the parallel nature of analytic
marching, we contribute AnalyticMesh, a software package that supports
efficient meshing of implicit surface networks via CUDA parallel computing, and
mesh simplification for efficient downstream processing. We apply our method to
different settings of generative shape modeling using implicit surface
networks. Extensive experiments demonstrate our advantages over existing
methods in terms of both meshing accuracy and efficiency.

numerical simulations, it corresponds to a morphologically analogous evolution
of the mass-density distribution (\rhopdf). The latter may display also a
second, shallower PLT at the stage of collapse of the first formed protostellar
cores. It is difficult to estimate the parameters of a possible second PLT due
to resolution constraints. To address the issue, we extend the method for the
extraction of single PLTs from arbitrary density distributions suggested by
Veltchev et al.(2019) to detect a second PLT. The technique is elaborated
through tests on an analytic \rhopdf{} and applied to a set of hydrodynamical
high-resolution simulations of isothermal self-gravitating clouds. In all but
one case two PLTs were detected -- the first slope is always steeper and the
second one is typically $\partial \ln V /\ln \rho \sim -1$. These results are
in a good agreement with numerical and theoretical works and do suggest that
the technique extracts correctly double PLTs from smooth PDFs.

Identical to a synchronous machine, a grid forming converter is expected to

However, GFC's realization has been different, with some utilizes inner current
and voltage controllers while others do not. This paper studies the impact of
the inner loop on the grid forming converter's ability to behave as a voltage
source behind an impedance. Three of the most popular GFC structures, 1) GFC
with cascaded voltage and current control, 2) with inner current control, 3)

MW level GFC with inner loops could potentially go unstable under weak power

within a narrow range of network impedances. Furthermore, it is also shown that
slow response behavior based on cascaded inner loop can impact on dynamic

classical theorem from chordal graphs to general graphs. While every
non-complete graph has at least two moplexes, little is known about structural
properties of graphs with a bounded number of moplexes. The study of these
graphs is, in part, motivated by the parallel between moplexes in general
graphs and simplicial modules in chordal graphs: unlike in the moplex setting,
properties of chordal graphs with a bounded number of simplicial modules are
well understood. For instance, chordal graphs having at most two simplicial
modules are interval.
  In this work, we initiate an investigation of $k$-moplex graphs, which are
defined as graphs containing at most $k$ moplexes. Of particular interest is
the smallest nontrivial case $k=2$, which forms a counterpart to the class of
interval graphs. As our main structural result, we show that, when restricted
to connected graphs, the class of $2$-moplex graphs is sandwiched between the
classes of proper interval graphs and cocomparability graphs; moreover, both
inclusions are tight for hereditary classes. From a complexity theoretic
viewpoint, this leads to the natural question of whether the presence of at
most two moplexes guarantees a sufficient amount of structure to efficiently
solve problems that are known to be intractable on cocomparability graphs, but
not on proper interval graphs. We develop new reductions that answer this
question negatively for two prominent problems fitting this profile, namely
Graph Isomorphism and Max-Cut. On the other hand, we prove that every connected
$2$-moplex graph contains a Hamiltonian path, generalising the same property of
connected proper interval graphs.

Recently, a survey was published, in which a framework describing the vast
majority of such methods was proposed [Soodhalter et al, GAMM-Mitt. 2020]. In
many of these methods, the Krylov subspace is one generated by the system
matrix composed with a projector that depends on the augmentation space.
However, it is not a requirement that a projected Krylov subspace be used.
There are augmentation methods built on using Krylov subspaces generated by the
original system matrix, and these methods also fit into the general framework.
  In this note, we observe that one gains implementation benefits by
considering such augmentation methods with unprojected Krylov subspaces in the
general framework. We demonstrate this by applying the idea to the R$^3$GMRES

covering number $F^*(f_\alpha)$ of the dynamical system is one. In other words,
there exists a basis $B$ such that for arbitrarily high $h$ an arbitrarily
large proportion of the unit torus can be covered by the Rokhlin tower
$(f_\alpha^kB)_{k=0}^{h-1}$. Although $B$ can be chosen with diameter smaller
than any fixed $\varepsilon > 0$, it is not always possible to take an interval
for $B$ but this can only be done when the partial quotients of $\alpha$ are
unbounded. In the present paper, we ask what maximum proportion of the torus
can be covered when $B$ is the union of $n_B \in \mathbb{N}$ disjoint
intervals. This question has been answered in the case $n_B =1$ by Checkhova,
and here we address the general situation. If $n_B = 2$ we give a precise
formula for the maximum proportion. Furthermore, we show that for fixed
$\alpha$ the maximum proportion converges to $1$ when $n_B \to \infty$.
Explicit lower bounds can be given if $\alpha$ has constant partial quotients.
Our approach is inspired by the construction involved in the proof of the

train deep leaning models on vertically partitioned data with
privacy-preservation. It attracts much attention both from academia and
industry. Unfortunately, applying most existing vertical federated learning
methods in real-world applications still faces two daunting challenges. First,
most existing vertical federated learning methods have a strong assumption that
at least one party holds the complete set of labels of all data samples, while
this assumption is not satisfied in many practical scenarios, where labels are
horizontally partitioned and the parties only hold partial labels. Existing
vertical federated learning methods can only utilize partial labels, which may
lead to inadequate model update in end-to-end backpropagation. Second,
computational and communication resources vary in parties. Some parties with
limited computational and communication resources will become the stragglers
and slow down the convergence of training. Such straggler problem will be
exaggerated in the scenarios of horizontally partitioned labels in vertical
federated learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel vertical
federated learning framework named Cascade Vertical Federated Learning (CVFL)
to fully utilize all horizontally partitioned labels to train neural networks
with privacy-preservation. To mitigate the straggler problem, we design a novel
optimization objective which can increase straggler's contribution to the
trained models. We conduct a series of qualitative experiments to rigorously
verify the effectiveness of CVFL. It is demonstrated that CVFL can achieve
comparable performance (e.g., accuracy for classification tasks) with
centralized training. The new optimization objective can further mitigate the
straggler problem comparing with only using the asynchronous aggregation
mechanism during training.

investigate the STIX performance at its detection limit. This first result
paper focuses on the temporal and spectral evolution of STIX microflares
occuring in the AR12765 in June 2020, and compares the STIX measurements with
GOES/XRS, SDO/AIA, and Hinode/XRT. For the observed microflares of the GOES A
and B class, the STIX peak time at lowest energies is located in the impulsive
phase of the flares, well before the GOES peak time. Such a behavior can either
be explained by the higher sensitivity of STIX to higher temperatures compared
to GOES, or due to the existence of a nonthermal component reaching down to low
energies. The interpretation is inconclusive due to limited counting statistics
for all but the largest flare in our sample. For this largest flare, the
low-energy peak time is clearly due to thermal emission, and the nonthermal
component seen at higher energies occurs even earlier. This suggests that the
classic thermal explanation might also be favored for the majority of the
smaller flares. In combination with EUV and SXR observations, STIX corroborates
earlier findings that an isothermal assumption is of limited validity. Future
diagnostic efforts should focus on multi-wavelength studies to derive
differential emission measure distributions over a wide range of temperatures
to accurately describe the energetics of solar flares. Commissioning
observations confirm that STIX is working as designed. As a rule of thumb, STIX
detects flares as small as the GOES A class. For flares above the GOES B class,
detailed spectral and imaging analyses can be performed.

the oscillation modes, which makes the oscillation spectrum more complex and
harder to interpret. Here we study the oscillation patterns of a sample of
benchmark $\delta$~Sct stars belonging to eclipsing binary systems with the
objective to find the frequency spacing related to the rotational splitting

differences. The last two showed a similar behaviour. For most of the stars, it
was necessary to determine the large separation ($\Delta\nu$) prior to spot
$\delta r$. This is the first time we may clearly state that one of the
periodicities present in the p~modes oscillation spectra of $\delta$~Sct stars
corresponds to the rotational splitting. This is true independently of the

speed, edge servers deployed in close proximity to the user, e.g., at some 5G

copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) and C$_{60}$. Two device architectures, the planar
heterojunction (PHJ) and the bulk heterojunction (BHJ), are directly compared
in view of differences in charge carrier decay dynamics. We apply a combination
of transient photovoltage (TPV) experiments, yielding the small perturbation
charge carrier lifetime, and charge extraction measurements, providing the
charge carrier density. In organic solar cells, charge photogeneration and
recombination primarily occur at the donor--acceptor heterointerface. Whereas
the BHJ can often be approximated by an effective medium due to rather small
scale phase separation, the PHJ has a well defined two-dimensional
heterointerface. To study recombination dynamics in PHJ devices most relevant
is the charge accumulation at this interface. As from extraction techniques
only the spatially averaged carrier concentration can be determined, we derive
the charge carrier density at the interface $n_{int}$ from the open circuit
voltage. Comparing the experimental results with macroscopic device simulation
we discuss the differences of recombination and charge carrier densities in
CuPc:C$_{60}$ PHJ and BHJ devices with respect to the device performance. The
open circuit voltage of BHJ is larger than for PHJ at low light intensities,
but at 0.3 sun the situation is reversed: here, the PHJ can finally take
advantage of its generally longer charge carrier lifetimes, as the active
recombination region is smaller.

  In this paper we introduce the Approximate Laplace Projection (ALP) mechanism

Laplace-mechanism applied to dense vectors. A key new technique is a unary
representation of small integers, which we show to be robust against
``randomized response'' noise. This representation is combined with hashing, in
the spirit of Bloom filters, to obtain a space-efficient, differentially

  Our theoretical performance bounds are complemented by simulations which show
that the constant factors on the main performance parameters are quite small,

downstream image reconstruction tasks, present in existing CL frameworks.
Experimentally, we find that RCL can learn robust and transferable

typically causes the temperature rise to become strongly sublinear, reaching
even several tens of percent. We then show that this can explain experimental

also triggers the breaking of the PQ symmetry, resulting in axion dark matter

larger. The CASPEr experiment can search for such an axion DM candidate. The
Hubble parameter during inflation must be low, $H_{inf} \lesssim 10^9 $ GeV, in

to acquire ground-truth data, preventing the adoption of distance metrics for
objective quality assessment. As a result, one often resorts to subjective
quality assessment, the most straightforward and reliable means of evaluating
image enhancement. Conventional subjective testing requires manually
pre-selecting a small set of visual examples, which may suffer from three
sources of biases: 1) sampling bias due to the extremely sparse distribution of
the selected samples in the image space; 2) algorithmic bias due to potential
overfitting the selected samples; 3) subjective bias due to further potential
cherry-picking test results. This eventually makes the field of real-world
image enhancement more of an art than a science. Here we take steps towards
debiasing conventional subjective assessment by automatically sampling a set of
adaptive and diverse images for subsequent testing. This is achieved by casting
sample selection into a joint maximization of the discrepancy between the
enhancers and the diversity among the selected input images. Careful visual
inspection on the resulting enhanced images provides a debiased ranking of the
enhancement algorithms. We demonstrate our subjective assessment method using
three popular and practically demanding image enhancement tasks: dehazing,
super-resolution, and low-light enhancement.

traditional single-molecule biophysics approaches detailed previously, is on
the emphasis of the development and use of complex methods which explicitly
combine multiple approaches to increase biological insights at the
single-molecule level. These so-called correlative single-molecule biophysics
methods rely on multiple, orthogonal tools and analysis, as opposed to any one
single driving technique. Importantly, they span both in vivo and in vitro
biological systems as well as the interfaces between theory and experiment in
often highly integrated ways, very different to earlier traditional
non-integrative approaches. The first applications of correlative
single-molecule methods involved adaption of a range of different experimental
technologies to the same biological sample whose measurements were
synchronised. However, now we find a greater flora of integrated methods
emerging that include approaches applied to different samples at different
times and yet still permit useful molecular-scale correlations to be performed.
The resultant findings often enable far greater precision of length and time
scales of measurements, and a more understanding of the interplay between
different processes in the same cell. Many new correlative single-molecule
biophysics techniques also include more complex, physiologically relevant
approaches as well as increasing number that combine advanced computational
methods and mathematical analysis with experimental tools. Here we review the
motivation behind the development of correlative single-molecule microscopy

  interpretability",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Interpretability has become a necessary feature for machine learning models
deployed in critical scenarios, e.g. legal system, healthcare. In these
situations, algorithmic decisions may have (potentially negative) long-lasting
effects on the end-user affected by the decision. In many cases, the
representational power of deep learning models is not needed, therefore simple
and interpretable models (e.g. linear models) should be preferred. However, in
high-dimensional and/or complex domains (e.g. computer vision), the universal
approximation capabilities of neural networks are required. Inspired by linear
models and the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, we propose a novel
class of structurally-constrained neural networks, which we call FLANs
(Feature-wise Latent Additive Networks). Crucially, FLANs process each input
feature separately, computing for each of them a representation in a common
latent space. These feature-wise latent representations are then simply summed,
and the aggregated representation is used for prediction. These constraints
(which are at the core of the interpretability of linear models) allow a user
to estimate the effect of each individual feature independently from the
others, enhancing interpretability. In a set of experiments across different
domains, we show how without compromising excessively the test performance, the
structural constraints proposed in FLANs indeed facilitates the
interpretability of deep learning models. We quantitatively compare FLANs
interpretability to post-hoc methods using recently introduced metrics,
discussing the advantages of natively interpretable models over a post-hoc
analysis.

volume discretizations of nonlinear conservation laws are analyzed. It is shown
that any consistent multistep or Runge-Kutta method is globally conservative.
Further, it is shown that Newton's method, Krylov subspace methods and
pseudo-time iterations are globally conservative while the Jacobi and
Gauss-Seidel methods are not in general. If pseudo-time iterations using an
explicit Runge-Kutta method are applied to a locally conservative
discretization, then the resulting scheme is also locally conservative.
However, the corresponding numerical flux can be inconsistent with the
conservation law. We prove an extension of the Lax-Wendroff theorem, which
reveals that numerical solutions based on these methods converge to weak
solutions of a modified conservation law where the flux function is multiplied
by a particular constant. This constant depends on the choice of Runge-Kutta
method but is independent of both the conservation law and the discretization.
Consistency is maintained by ensuring that this constant equals unity and a
strategy for achieving this is presented. Experiments show that this strategy
improves the convergence rate of the pseudo-time iterations.

unitary dynamics and stochastic measurements, performed by the environment,
along wavefunction trajectories can give rise to transitions in the
entanglement scaling. In this work, complementary to these previous studies, we
analyze a situation where the role of Hamiltonian and dissipative dynamics is
reversed. We consider an engineered dissipation, which stabilizes an entangled
phase of a quantum spin$-1/2$ chain, while competing single-particle or
interacting Hamiltonian dynamics induce a disentangled phase. Focusing on the
single-particle unitary dynamics, we find that the system undergoes an
entanglement transition from a logarithmic growth to an area law when the
competition ratio between the unitary evolution and the non-unitary dynamics
increases. We evidence that the transition manifests itself in state-dependent
observables at a finite competition ratio for Hamiltonian and measurement
dynamics. On the other hand, it is absent in trajectory-averaged steady-state
dynamics, governed by a Lindblad master equation: although purely dissipative
dynamics stabilizes an entangled state, for any non-vanishing Hamiltonian
contribution the system ends up irremediably in a disordered phase. In
addition, a single trajectory analysis reveals that the distribution of the
entanglement entropy constitutes an efficient indicator of the transition.
Complementarily, we explore the competition of the dissipation with coherent
dynamics generated by an interacting Hamiltonian, and demonstrate that the
entanglement transition also occurs in this second model. Our results suggest
that this type of transition takes place for a broader class of Hamiltonians,
underlining its robustness in monitored open quantum many-body systems.

hierarchically clustered observations. A main feature is the capability to
estimate (cluster-specific) random effect parameters, while their distribution
describes the variation across clusters. However, the MLM can only model
positive associations among clustered observations, and it is not suitable for
small sample sizes. The limitation of the MLM becomes apparent when estimation
methods produce negative estimates for random effect variances, which can be
seen as an indication that observations are negatively correlated. A gentle
introduction to Bayesian Covariance Structure Modelling (BCSM) is given, which
makes it possible to model also negatively correlated observations. The BCSM
does not model dependences through random (cluster-specific) effects, but
through a covariance matrix. We show that this makes the BCSM particularly
useful for small data samples. We draw specific attention to detect effects of
a personalized intervention. The effect of a personalized treatment can differ
across individuals, and this can lead to negative associations among
measurements of individuals who are treated by the same therapist. It is shown
that the BCSM enables the modeling of negative associations among clustered
measurements and aids in the interpretation of negative clustering effects.
Through a simulation study and by analysis of a real data example, we discuss
the suitability of the BCSM for small data sets and for exploring effects of

tool to assist humanitarian landmine clearance. However, the quality of
synthetic aperture radar images depends on accurate and precise motion
estimation of the radar antennas as well as generating informative viewpoints
with the MAV. This paper presents a complete and automatic airborne
ground-penetrating synthetic aperture radar (GPSAR) system. The system consists
of a spatially calibrated and temporally synchronized industrial grade sensor
suite that enables navigation above ground level, radar imaging, and optical
imaging. A custom mission planning framework allows generation and automatic
execution of stripmap and circular (GPSAR) trajectories controlled above ground
level as well as aerial imaging survey flights. A factor graph based state
estimator fuses measurements from dual receiver real-time kinematic (RTK)
global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and inertial measurement unit (IMU)
to obtain precise, high rate platform positions and orientations. Ground truth
experiments showed sensor timing as accurate as 0.8 us and as precise as 0.1 us
with localization rates of 1 kHz. The dual position factor formulation improves
online localization accuracy up to 40% and batch localization accuracy up to
59% compared to a single position factor with uncertain heading initialization.
Our field trials validated a localization accuracy and precision that enables
coherent radar measurement addition and detection of radar targets buried in
sand. This validates the potential as an aerial landmine detection system.

investigate the effect of the spin-orbit coupling arising from the confining

weakly-relativistic corrections. Two ideal geometries are considered in detail,
the sphere and the half-sphere, focusing on the expected increased role of the
spin-orbit coupling upon a symmetry reduction, and the application of these

a perturbative treatment of the magnetic field, leading to tractable
semi-analytical and semiclassical expressions for the case of the sphere, while
a numerical treatment becomes necessary for the half-sphere. The correction to
the zero-field susceptibility arising from the spin-orbit coupling in a single

energy correction, which in turn remains considerably smaller than the typical
values of the nonrelativistic zero-field susceptibility. Moreover, the

programming language in a modular fashion, making it easy to install, modify,
and run on various operating systems. ELISa implements Roche geometry and the
triangulation process to model a surface of the eclipsing binary components,
where the surface parameters of each surface element are treated separately.
Surface symmetries and approximations based on the similarity between surface
geometries were used to reduce the runtime during light curve calculation
significantly. ELISa implements the least square trust region reflective
algorithm and Markov-chain Monte Carlo optimisation methods to provide the
built-in capability to determine parameters of the binary system from
photometric observations and radial velocities. The precision and speed of the
light curve generator were evaluated using various benchmarks. We conclude that
ELISa maintains an acceptable level of accuracy to analyse data from

symmetry energy therefore constitutes an important scientific objective. Many
analyses have been limited to extracting values for the symmetry energy, $S_0$,
and its ``derivative'', $L$, at saturation density $\rho_0 \approx 2.6 \times
10^{14}~\mathrm{g/cm^3}$ $\approx 0.16~\mathrm{nucleons/fm^{3}}$, resulting in

making the extracted values of $S_0$ or $L$ imprecise. By focusing on the
densities these observables actually probe, we obtain a detailed picture of the
density dependence of the symmetry energy from $0.25\rho_0$ to $1.5\rho_0$.

the manifolds have first homology group equal to $\mathbb{Z}^n$, and we require
the embeddings to induce isomorphisms between first homology groups. In this

a combinatorial optimization problem, namely packing certain allowable
simplices into a given standard simplex. They designed a computer program and
presented computational results. In particular, they determined the simplex
packing widths in dimension four for up to $k=12$ simplices, along with lower
bounds for higher values of $k$. We present a modified algorithmic approach
that allows us to determine the $k$-simplex packing widths for up to $k = 13$
simplices in dimension four and up to $k = 8$ simplices in dimension six.
Moreover, our approach determines all simplex-multisets that allow for optimal

the neuromotor disorder from speech. Such systems are particularly susceptible
to domain mismatch where the training and testing data come from the source and
target domains respectively, but the two domains may differ in terms of speech
stimuli, disease etiology, etc. It is hard to acquire labelled data in the
target domain, due to high costs of annotating sizeable datasets. This paper
makes a first attempt to formulate cross-domain DSD as an unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) problem. We use labelled source-domain data and unlabelled
target-domain data, and propose a multi-task learning strategy, including
dysarthria presence classification (DPC), domain adversarial training (DAT) and
mutual information minimization (MIM), which aim to learn
dysarthria-discriminative and domain-invariant biomarker embeddings.
Specifically, DPC helps biomarker embeddings capture critical indicators of
dysarthria; DAT forces biomarker embeddings to be indistinguishable in source
and target domains; and MIM further reduces the correlation between biomarker
embeddings and domain-related cues. By treating the UASPEECH and TORGO corpora
respectively as the source and target domains, experiments show that the
incorporation of UDA attains absolute increases of 22.2% and 20.0% respectively
in utterance-level weighted average recall and speaker-level accuracy.

visual field and block out interactions with individuals behind them. Here, we
systematically study the effect of a group's spatial structure, its density as

time-dependent differential equations by parallelising the temporal domain.
Given approximate initial values at each temporal sub-interval, the algorithm
locates a solution in a fixed number of iterations using a predictor-corrector,
stopping once a tolerance is met. This iterative process combines solutions
located by inexpensive (coarse resolution) and expensive (fine resolution)
numerical integrators. In this paper, we introduce a stochastic parareal
algorithm aimed at accelerating the convergence of the deterministic parareal
algorithm. Instead of providing the predictor-corrector with a
deterministically located set of initial values, the stochastic algorithm
samples initial values from dynamically varying probability distributions in
each temporal sub-interval. All samples are then propagated in parallel using
the expensive integrator. The set of sampled initial values yielding the most
continuous (smoothest) trajectory across consecutive sub-intervals are fed into
the predictor-corrector, converging in fewer iterations than the deterministic
algorithm with a given probability. The performance of the stochastic
algorithm, implemented using various probability distributions, is illustrated
on low-dimensional systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We
provide numerical evidence that when the number of sampled initial values is
large enough, stochastic parareal converges almost certainly in fewer
iterations than the deterministic algorithm, maintaining solution accuracy.
Given its stochastic nature, we also highlight that multiple simulations of
stochastic parareal return a distribution of solutions that can represent a
measure of uncertainty over the ODE solution.

distorted. Previous works have studied the spatial distribution of this
distortion for a central massive MIMO array. In this work, we extend the
analysis for distributed massive MIMO in a line-of-sight scenario. We show that
the distortion is not always uniformly distributed in space. In the single-user
case, it coherently combines at the user location. In the few users case, the
signals will add up at the user locations plus several others locations. As the
number of users increases, it becomes close to uniformly distributed. As a
comparison with a central massive MIMO system, having the same total number of
antennas, the distortion in distributed massive MIMO is considerably more
uniformly distributed in space. Moreover, the potential coherent combining is
contained in a zone rather than in generic directions, i.e., in a beamspot.
Furthermore, a small-scale fading effect is observed at unintended locations
due to the non-coherent combining of the signals. As a result, one can expect
that going towards distributed systems allows working closer to saturation,
increasing the PA operating efficiency and/or using low-cost PAs.

different energy functions, including a conventional point charge (PC)-based
force field, one based on a multipolar (MTP) representation of the
electrostatics, and a semiempirical DFT method. For the 1-d infrared spectra,
the frequency splitting between the two amide-I groups is 10 cm$^{-1}$ from the
PC, 13 cm$^{-1}$ from the MTP, and 47 cm$^{-1}$ from SCC-DFTB simulations,
compared with 25 cm$^{-1}$ from experiment. The frequency trajectory required
for determining the frequency fluctuation correlation function (FFCF) is
determined from individual (INM) and full normal mode (FNM) analyses of the
amide-I vibrations. The spectroscopy, time-zero magnitude of the FFCF $C(t=0)$,
and the static component $\Delta_0^2$ from simulations using MTP and analysis
based on FNM are all consistent with experiments for (Ala)$_3$. Contrary to
that, for the analysis excluding mode-mode coupling (INM) the FFCF decays to
zero too rapidly and for simulations with a PC-based force field the
$\Delta_0^2$ is too small by a factor of two compared with experiments.
Simulations with SCC-DFTB agree better with experiment for these observables
than those from PC-based simulations. The conformational ensemble sampled from
simulations using PCs is consistent with the literature , whereas that covered
by the MTP-based simulations is dominated by P$_{\rm II}$ which agrees with and
confirms recently reported, Bayesian-refined populations based on 1-dimensional
infrared experiments. Full normal mode analysis together with a MTP
representation provides a meaningful model to correctly describe the dynamics

governed by the Gorini--Kossakowski--Lindblad--Sudarshan master equation with
Hamiltonian and dissipation superoperator depending, correspondingly, on
piecewise constant coherent and incoherent controls with constrained
magnitudes. Additional constraints on controls' variations are also considered.
The system is analyzed using Bloch parametrization of the system's density
matrix. We adapt the section method for obtaining outer parallelepipedal and
pointwise estimations of reachable and controllability sets in the Bloch ball
via solving a number of problems for optimizing coherent and incoherent
controls with respect to some objective criteria. The differential evolution
and dual annealing optimization methods are used. The numerical results show
how the reachable sets' estimations depend on distances between the system's
initial states and the Bloch ball's center point, final times, constraints on
controls' magnitudes and variations.

  Deep Neural Networks","15 pages, accepted at IEEE TDSC",,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Trigger set-based watermarking schemes have gained emerging attention as they
provide a means to prove ownership for deep neural network model owners. In
this paper, we argue that state-of-the-art trigger set-based watermarking
algorithms do not achieve their designed goal of proving ownership. We posit
that this impaired capability stems from two common experimental flaws that the
existing research practice has committed when evaluating the robustness of
watermarking algorithms: (1) incomplete adversarial evaluation and (2)
overlooked adaptive attacks. We conduct a comprehensive adversarial evaluation
of 11 representative watermarking schemes against six of the existing attacks
and demonstrate that each of these watermarking schemes lacks robustness
against at least two non-adaptive attacks. We also propose novel adaptive
attacks that harness the adversary's knowledge of the underlying watermarking
algorithm of a target model. We demonstrate that the proposed attacks
effectively break all of the 11 watermarking schemes, consequently allowing
adversaries to obscure the ownership of any watermarked model. We encourage
follow-up studies to consider our guidelines when evaluating the robustness of
their watermarking schemes via conducting comprehensive adversarial evaluation
that includes our adaptive attacks to demonstrate a meaningful upper bound of
watermark robustness.

(e.g., Bartle, BrainHex, and Hexad) to represent the different user profiles in
games and gamified settings. However, the results of applying these user models
in practice (e.g., to personalize gamified systems) are still contradictory.
One of the hypotheses for these results is that the user types can change over
time (i.e., user types are dynamic). To start to understand whether user types
can change over time, we conducted an exploratory study analyzing data from 74
participants to identify if their user type (Achiever, Philanthropist,
Socialiser, Free Spirit, Player, and Disruptor) had changed over time (six
months). The results indicate that there is a change in the dominant user type
of the participants, as well as the average scores in the Hexad sub-scales.
These results imply that all the scores should be considered when defining the
Hexad's user type and that the user types are dynamic. Our results contribute
with practical implications, indicating that the personalization currently made
(generally static) may be insufficient to improve the users' experience,
requiring user types to be analyzed continuously and personalization to be done
dynamically.

perturbations in their inputs, was independently discovered by several research
groups in 2013. However, despite enormous effort, these adversarial examples
remained a counterintuitive phenomenon with no simple testable explanation. In
this paper, we introduce a new conceptual framework for how the decision
boundary between classes evolves during training, which we call the {\em
Dimpled Manifold Model}. In particular, we demonstrate that training is divided
into two distinct phases. The first phase is a (typically fast) clinging
process in which the initially randomly oriented decision boundary gets very
close to the low dimensional image manifold, which contains all the training
examples. Next, there is a (typically slow) dimpling phase which creates
shallow bulges in the decision boundary that move it to the correct side of the
training examples. This framework provides a simple explanation for why
adversarial examples exist, why their perturbations have such tiny norms, and
why they look like random noise rather than like the target class. This
explanation is also used to show that a network that was adversarially trained
with incorrectly labeled images might still correctly classify most test
images, and to show that the main effect of adversarial training is just to
deepen the generated dimples in the decision boundary. Finally, we discuss and
demonstrate the very different properties of on-manifold and off-manifold
adversarial perturbations. We describe the results of numerous experiments
which strongly support this new model, using both low dimensional synthetic
datasets and high dimensional natural datasets.

sensor. This sensor utilizes a 3D printed micro-lens ring feeding six
multi-mode fibers to sense misaligned light, allowing centroid reconstruction.
A tip-tilt mirror allows the beam to be corrected, increasing the amount of
light coupled into a centrally positioned single-mode (science) fiber. The
sensor was tested with the iLocater acquisition camera at the Large Binocular
Telescope in November 2019. The limit on the maximum achieved root mean square
reconstruction accuracy was found to be 0.19 $\lambda$/D in both tip and tilt,
of which approximately 50% of the power originates at frequencies below 10 Hz.
We show the reconstruction accuracy is highly dependent on the estimated Strehl
ratio and simulations support the assumption that residual adaptive optics
aberrations are the main limit to the reconstruction accuracy. We conclude that
this sensor is ideally suited to remove post-adaptive optics non-common path
tip tilt residuals. We discuss the next steps for the concept development,
including optimizations of the lens and fiber, tuning of the correction
algorithm and selection of optimal science cases.

First, we devise a hierarchical learning component to learn short-term and
long-term sequential patterns from stock time series. Second, a fully-connected
graph between stocks and a fully-connected graph between sectors are
constructed, along with graph attention networks, to learn the latent
interactions among stocks and sectors. Third, a multi-task objective is devised
to jointly recommend the profitable stocks and predict the stock movement.

remarkable recommendation performance of our FinGAT, comparing to

the infinite-width Gaussian description. We explain how these effectively-deep
networks learn nontrivial representations from training and more broadly
analyze the mechanism of representation learning for nonlinear models. From a
nearly-kernel-methods perspective, we find that the dependence of such models'
predictions on the underlying learning algorithm can be expressed in a simple
and universal way. To obtain these results, we develop the notion of
representation group flow (RG flow) to characterize the propagation of signals
through the network. By tuning networks to criticality, we give a practical
solution to the exploding and vanishing gradient problem. We further explain
how RG flow leads to near-universal behavior and lets us categorize networks
built from different activation functions into universality classes.
Altogether, we show that the depth-to-width ratio governs the effective model
complexity of the ensemble of trained networks. By using information-theoretic
techniques, we estimate the optimal aspect ratio at which we expect the network
to be practically most useful and show how residual connections can be used to
push this scale to arbitrary depths. With these tools, we can learn in detail
about the inductive bias of architectures, hyperparameters, and optimizers.

Bandit problem (TBP) under several shape constraints. In the TBP, the objective
of the learner is to output, at the end of a sequential game, the set of arms

already well studied in the literature. Taking $K$ as the number of arms, we

monotonically increasing (MTBP) and (ii) the case where $(\mu_k)_{k=1}^K$ is
concave (CTBP). We consider both cases in the problem dependent regime and
study the probability of error - i.e. the probability to mis-classify at least
one arm. In the fixed budget setting, we provide upper and lower bounds for the
probability of error in both the concave and monotone settings, as well as
associated algorithms. In both settings the bounds match in the problem

governed by disk angular momentum transport, mediated by magnetic fields. In
the most observable outer disk, PPD gas dynamics is primarily controlled by
ambipolar diffusion as the dominant non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effect.
In this work, we study the gas dynamics in outer PPDs by conducting a set of
global 3D non-ideal MHD simulations with ambipolar diffusion and net poloidal
magnetic flux, using the Athena++ MHD code, with resolution comparable to local
simulations. Our simulations demonstrate the co-existence of magnetized disk
wind and turbulence driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). While
MHD wind dominates disk angular momentum transport, the MRI turbulence also
contributes significantly. We observe that magnetic flux spontaneously
concentrate into axisymmetric flux sheets, leading to radial variations in
turbulence levels, stresses, and accretion rates. Annular substructures arise
as a natural consequence of magnetic flux concentration. The flux concentration
phenomena show diverse properties with different levels of disk magnetization
and ambipolar diffusion. The disk generally loses magnetic flux over time,
though flux sheets could prevent the leak of magnetic flux in some cases. Our
results demonstrate the ubiquity of disk annular substructures in weakly MRI
turbulent outer PPDs, and imply a stochastic nature of disk evolution.

novel analytical solutions for linear-order gravitational waves or tensor
perturbations in a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker universe containing two
perfect fluids -- radiation and pressureless dust -- and allowing for neutrino
anisotropic stress. One of the results applies to any sub-horizon gravitational
wave in such a universe. Another result applies to gravitational waves of
primordial origin (for example, produced during inflation) and works both
before and after they cross the horizon. These results improve on analytical
approximations previously set out in the literature. Comparison with numerical
solutions shows that both these approximations are accurate to within 1% or
better, for a wide range of wave-numbers relevant for cosmology. We present a
new and independent approach to computing the relativistic galaxy number counts

expressions for the full second-order relativistic observed redshift, for the
angular diameter distance and the volume spanned by a survey. We then compare
our result with previous works which compute the general distance-redshift

percolation, where connected components of occupied vertices freeze (they stop
growing) as soon as they contain at least $N$ vertices, and forest fire
processes, where connected components burn (they become entirely vacant) at
rate $\zeta > 0$. In this paper, we prove that when the density of occupied
sites approaches the critical threshold for Bernoulli percolation, both
processes display a striking phenomenon: the appearance of near-critical
""avalanches"".
  More specifically, we analyze the avalanches, all the way up to the natural
characteristic scale of each model, which constitutes an important step toward
understanding the self-organized critical behavior of such processes. For
frozen percolation, we show in particular that the number of frozen clusters
surrounding a given vertex is asymptotically equivalent to $(\log(96/5))^{-1}
\log \log N$ as $N \to \infty$. A similar mechanism underlies forest fires,
enabling us to obtain an analogous result for these processes, but with
substantially more work: the number of burnt clusters is equivalent to
$(\log(96/41))^{-1} \log \log (\zeta^{-1})$ as $\zeta \searrow 0$. Moreover,
almost all of these clusters have a volume $\zeta^{- 91/55 + o(1)}$.

the homogeneous part of energy density and how they modify the Friedmann
equations. In general, backreaction requires to go beyond the pressureless
ideal fluid approximation, and this can lead to a reduced growth of
cosmological large scale structure. Since observational evidence favours
evolution close to the standard growing mode in the linear regime, we focus on
two-component fluids in which the non-ideal fluid is gravitationally coupled to
cold dark matter and in which a standard growing mode persists. This is
realized, e.g. for a baryonic fluid coupled to cold dark matter. We calculate
the backreaction for this case and for a wide range of other two-fluid models.
Here the effect is either suppressed because the non-ideal matter properties
are numerically too small, or because they lead to a too stringent UV cut-off
of the integral over the power spectrum that determines backreaction. We
discuss then matter field backreaction from a broader perspective and
generalize the formalism such that also far-from-equilibrium scenarios relevant

black-box learning machines such as deep neural networks, resulting in useful
local and global explanation methods. For local explanation, stochasticity is
known to help: a simple method, called SmoothGrad, has improved the visual
quality of gradient-based attribution by adding noise to the input space and
averaging the explanations of the noisy inputs. In this paper, we extend this
idea and propose NoiseGrad that enhances both local and global explanation
methods. Specifically, NoiseGrad introduces stochasticity in the weight
parameter space, such that the decision boundary is perturbed. NoiseGrad is
expected to enhance the local explanation, similarly to SmoothGrad, due to the
dual relationship between the input perturbation and the decision boundary
perturbation. We evaluate NoiseGrad and its fusion with SmoothGrad --
FusionGrad -- qualitatively and quantitatively with several evaluation
criteria, and show that our novel approach significantly outperforms the
baseline methods. Both NoiseGrad and FusionGrad are method-agnostic and as
handy as SmoothGrad using a simple heuristic for the choice of the
hyperparameter setting without the need of finetuning.

learns a model from a set of participating users without sharing raw data. One
major challenge of FL comes with heterogeneous users, who may have
distributionally different (or non-iid) data and varying computation resources.
As federated users would use the model for prediction, they often demand the
trained model to be robust against malicious attackers at test time. Whereas
adversarial training (AT) provides a sound solution for centralized learning,
extending its usage for federated users has imposed significant challenges, as
many users may have very limited training data and tight computational budgets,
to afford the data-hungry and costly AT. In this paper, we study a novel FL
strategy: propagating adversarial robustness from rich-resource users that can
afford AT, to those with poor resources that cannot afford it, during federated

efficient propagation approach by the proper use of batch-normalization. We

embedded deeply in dashcam video data. Therefore, the early anticipation of
traffic accidents remains a challenge. Inspired by the attention behavior of
humans in visually perceiving accident risks, this paper proposes a Dynamic

from dashcam videos. The DSTA-network learns to select discriminative temporal

also learns to focus on the informative spatial regions of frames with a

that it has exceeded the state-of-the-art performance. A thorough ablation
study that assesses the DSTA-network at the component level reveals how the

fuse the prediction scores from two complementary models and verifies its

in this work we first derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for a

ingredients for a wide range of astrophysical studies including time-delay
cosmography in which strongly lensed quasar systems are used to determine the
Hubble constant and other cosmological parameters. Astrometric uncertainty on
the positions of the multiply-imaged point sources contributes to the overall
uncertainty in inferred distances and therefore the Hubble constant. Similarly,
knowledge of the wings of the points spread function (PSF) is necessary to
disentangle light from the background sources and the foreground deflector. We
analyze adaptive optics (AO) images of the strong lens system J0659+1629
obtained with the W. M. Keck Observatory using the laser guide star AO system.
We show that by using a reconstructed point spread function we can i) obtain
astrometric precision of $< 1$ milliarcsecond (mas), which is more than
sufficient for time-delay cosmography; and ii) subtract all point-like images
resulting in residuals consistent with the noise level. The method we have
developed is not limited to strong lensing, and is generally applicable to a
wide range of scientific cases that have multiple point sources nearby.

Existing studies of users' privacy behavior modeling attempt to frame the

Moreover, very few of them take into the consideration the aspect of
correctness, explainability, usability, and acceptance of the methodologies for

model, validate, and verify personalized privacy disclosure behavior based on
the analysis of the user's situational decision-making process. We use a model

Vehicles usually have preference on lanes according to their routes and
destinations. Few of the existing studies looks into the problem of controlling

control method that considers vehicles' preference on different lanes. The
bi-level formation control framework is utilized to plan collision-free motion
for vehicles, where relative target assignment and path planning are performed
in the upper level, and trajectory planning and tracking are performed in the
lower level. The collision-free multi-vehicle path planning problem considering
lane preference is decoupled into two sub problems: calculating assignment list
with non-decreasing cost and planning collision-free paths according to given
assignment result. The Conflict-based Searching (CBS) method is utilized to
plan collision-free paths for vehicles based on given assignment results. Case
study is conducted and simulations are carried out in a three-lane road
scenario. The results indicate that the proposed formation control method
significantly reduces congestion and improves traffic efficiency at high
traffic volumes, compared to the rule-based method.

domain adaptation (UDA) problem, in which we cannot access source domain data
due to data privacy issues but only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled
target data are available. This task, however, is very difficult due to one key
challenge: the lack of source data and target domain labels makes model
adaptation very challenging. To address this, we propose to mine the hidden
knowledge in the source model and exploit it to generate source avatar
prototypes (i.e., representative features for each source class) as well as
target pseudo labels for domain alignment. To this end, we propose a
Contrastive Prototype Generation and Adaptation (CPGA) method. Specifically,
CPGA consists of two stages: (1) prototype generation: by exploring the
classification boundary information of the source model, we train a prototype
generator to generate avatar prototypes via contrastive learning. (2) prototype
adaptation: based on the generated source prototypes and target pseudo labels,
we develop a new robust contrastive prototype adaptation strategy to align each
pseudo-labeled target data to the corresponding source prototypes. Extensive
experiments on three UDA benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
superiority of the proposed method.

are classically used to sample from intractable posterior distributions, they
can suffer from scalability issues in high-dimensional inference problems such

posterior distributions using products of multivariate Gaussian densities.
Moreover, imposing structural constraints on the covariance matrices of these
densities allows for greater scalability and distributed computation. While the
method is naturally suited to handle additive Gaussian observation noise, it
can also be extended to non-Gaussian noise. Experiments conducted for
denoising, inpainting and deconvolution problems with Gaussian and Poisson

agents make many decisions on behalf of humans. From healthcare decision making
to social media censoring, these agents face problems, and make decisions with
ethical and societal implications. Ethical behaviour is a critical
characteristic that we would like in a human-centric AI. A common observation
in human-centric industries, like the service industry and healthcare, is that
their professionals tend to break rules, if necessary, for pro-social reasons.
This behaviour among humans is defined as pro-social rule breaking. To make AI
agents more human centric, we argue that there is a need for a mechanism that
helps AI agents identify when to break rules set by their designers. To
understand when AI agents need to break rules, we examine the conditions under
which humans break rules for pro-social reasons. In this paper, we present a
study that introduces a 'vaccination strategy dilemma' to human participants
and analyses their responses. In this dilemma, one needs to decide whether they
would distribute Covid-19 vaccines only to members of a high-risk group (follow
the enforced rule) or, in selected cases, administer the vaccine to a few
social influencers (break the rule), which might yield an overall greater
benefit to society. The results of the empirical study suggest a relationship
between stakeholder utilities and pro-social rule breaking (PSRB), which
neither deontological nor utilitarian ethics completely explain. Finally, the
paper discusses the design characteristics of an ethical agent capable of PSRB
and the future research directions on PSRB in the AI realm. We hope that this
will inform the design of future AI agents, and their decision-making
behaviour.
