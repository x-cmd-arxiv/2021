information to influence the behavior of a self-interested receiver. Classical
models make the stringent assumption that the sender knows the receiver's
utility. This can be relaxed by considering an online learning framework in
which the sender repeatedly faces a receiver of an unknown, adversarially
selected type. We study, for the first time, an online Bayesian persuasion
setting with multiple receivers. We focus on the case with no externalities and
binary actions, as customary in offline models. Our goal is to design no-regret
algorithms for the sender with polynomial per-iteration running time. First, we
prove a negative result: for any $0 < \alpha \leq 1$, there is no
polynomial-time no-$\alpha$-regret algorithm when the sender's utility function
is supermodular or anonymous. Then, we focus on the case of submodular sender's
utility functions and we show that, in this case, it is possible to design a
polynomial-time no-$(1 - \frac{1}{e})$-regret algorithm. To do so, we introduce
a general online gradient descent scheme to handle online learning problems
with a finite number of possible loss functions. This requires the existence of
an approximate projection oracle. We show that, in our setting, there exists
one such projection oracle which can be implemented in polynomial time.

unique technique for tuning the spectrum intensity, spatial distribution, and

Our study shows an exponential coupling behavior when two gold nanorods are
assembled in end-to-end and side-by-side dimer configurations with a small
separation distance. The maximum electric field in the gaps between adjacent
nanorods in end-to-end dimer configuration describes a more significant

propose the first reduction of model selection in contextual bandits to offline
model selection oracles, allowing for flexible general purpose algorithms with
computational requirements no worse than those for model selection for

contextual bandits. When one of the classes in our set is realizable, up to a
logarithmic dependency on the number of classes, our algorithm attains optimal
realizability-based regret bounds for that class under one of two conditions:
if the time-horizon is large enough, or if an assumption that helps with
detecting misspecification holds. Hence our algorithm adapts to the complexity
of this unknown class. Even when this realizable class is known, we prove
improved regret guarantees in early rounds by relying on simpler model classes
for those rounds and hence further establish the importance of model selection
in contextual bandits.

challenging task due to the inaccurate localization of specific attributes. In
this paper, we propose a novel view-attribute localization method based on
attention (VALA), which utilizes view information to guide the recognition
process to focus on specific attributes and attention mechanism to localize
specific attribute-corresponding areas. Concretely, view information is
leveraged by the view prediction branch to generate four view weights that
represent the confidences for attributes from different views. View weights are
then delivered back to compose specific view-attributes, which will participate
and supervise deep feature extraction. In order to explore the spatial location
of a view-attribute, regional attention is introduced to aggregate spatial
information and encode inter-channel dependencies of the view feature.
Subsequently, a fine attentive attribute-specific region is localized, and
regional weights for the view-attribute from different spatial locations are
gained by the regional attention. The final view-attribute recognition outcome
is obtained by combining the view weights with the regional weights.
Experiments on three wide datasets (RAP, RAPv2, and PA-100K) demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach compared with state-of-the-art methods.

released into the Galaxy is still largely unknown. The comparison between
cosmic-ray electron and proton spectra measured at Earth suggests that
electrons are released with a spectrum steeper than protons by $\Delta s_{\rm
ep} \sim 0.3$ for energies above $\sim 10$ GeV and by $\Delta s_{\rm ep} \sim
1.2$ above $\sim 1$ TeV. Assuming that both species are accelerated at
supernova remnant shocks, we here explore two possible scenarios that can in
principle justify steeper electron spectra: (i) energy losses due to
synchrotron radiation in an amplified magnetic field, and (ii) time dependent
acceleration efficiency. We account for magnetic field amplification produced
by either cosmic-ray induced instabilities or by magneto-hydrodynamics
instabilities my means of a parametric description. We show that both
mechanisms are required to explain the electron spectrum. In particular
synchrotron losses can only produce a significant electron steepening above
$\sim 1$~TeV, while a time dependent acceleration can explain the spectrum at
lower energies if the electron injection into diffusive shock acceleration is
inversely proportional to the shock speed. We discuss observational and
theoretical evidences supporting such a behaviour. Furthermore, we predict two
additional spectral features: a spectral break below $\sim$ few GeV (as
required by existing observations) due to the acceleration efficiency drop
during the adiabatic phase, and a spectral hardening above $\sim 20$ TeV (where
no data are available yet) resulting from electrons escaping from the shock

dissipation processes governed by self-organized criticality. Here we analyze
75 data sets of stellar flare size distributions, mostly obtained from the {\sl
Extreme Ultra-Violet Explorer (EUVE)} and the {\sl Kepler} mission. We aim to
answer the following questions for size distributions of stellar flares: (i)
What are the values and uncertainties of power law slopes? (ii) Do power law
slopes vary with time ? (iii) Do power law slopes depend on the stellar
spectral type? (iv) Are they compatible with solar flares? (v) Are they
consistent with self-organized criticality (SOC) models? We find that the
observed size distributions of stellar flare fluences (or energies) exhibit
power law slopes of $\alpha_E=2.09\pm0.24$ for optical data sets observed with
Kepler. The observed power law slopes do not show much time variability and do
not depend on the stellar spectral type (M, K, G, F, A, Giants). In solar
flares we find that background subtraction lowers the uncorrected value of
$\alpha_E=2.20\pm0.22$ to $\alpha_E=1.57\pm0.19$. Furthermore, most of the
stellar flares are temporally not resolved in low-cadence (30 min) Kepler data,
which causes an additional bias. Taking these two biases into account, the
stellar flare data sets are consistent with the theoretical prediction $N(x)
\propto x^{-\alpha_x}$ of self-organized criticality models, i.e.,
$\alpha_E=1.5$. Thus, accurate power law fits require automated detection of
the inertial range and background subtraction, which can be modeled with the
generalized Pareto distribution, finite-system size effects, and extreme event
outliers.

that the spin measurements are driven by the merger and ringdown parts of the

checkerboard pattern in its interior that gives rise to a category
$\text{Diag}(\mathcal{S})$. The indecomposable objects of
$\text{Diag}(\mathcal{S})$ are the 2-diagonals in $\mathcal{S}$, and its
morphisms are given by certain pivoting moves between the 2-diagonals. We
conjecture that the category $\text{Diag}(\mathcal{S})$ is equivalent to the
stable syzygy category over the algebra $B$, such that the rotation of the
polygon corresponds to the shift functor on the syzygies. In particular, the
number of indecomposable syzygies is finite and the projective resolutions are
periodic. We prove the conjecture in the special case where every chordless

Dirac bands in the lower branch and a dispersionless flat band close to $E_{\rm
F}$ in the upper branch. The electronic instability via Fermi surface nesting
could play a role in determining these CDW-related features. The
superconducting gap of $\sim$0.4 meV is observed on both the electron band
around $\bar{\Gamma}$ and the flat band around $\bar{K}$, implying the
multiband superconductivity. The finite density of states (DOS) at $E_{\rm F}$
in the CDW phase are most likely in favor of the emergence of multiband
superconductivity, particularly the enhanced DOS associated with the flat band.
Our results not only shed light on the controversial origin of the CDW, but
also offer insights into the relationship between CDW and superconductivity.

multiple clinical trials and healthcare procedures. Cardiovascular diseases
monitoring, usually involving electrocardiogram (ECG) traces analysis, is one
of the most promising and high-impact applications. Nevertheless, to fully
exploit the potential of IoMT in this domain, some steps forward are needed.
First, the edge-computing paradigm must be added to the picture. A certain
level of near-sensor processing has to be enabled, to improve the scalability,
portability, reliability, responsiveness of the IoMT nodes. Second, novel,
increasingly accurate, data analysis algorithms, such as those based on
artificial intelligence and Deep Learning, must be exploited. To reach these
objectives, designers and programmers of IoMT nodes, have to face challenging
optimization tasks, in order to execute fairly complex computing tasks on
low-power wearable and portable processing systems, with tight power and
battery lifetime budgets. In this work, we explore the implementation of a
cognitive data analysis algorithm, based on a convolutional neural network
trained to classify ECG waveforms, on a resource-constrained
microcontroller-based computing platform. To minimize power consumption, we add
an adaptivity layer that dynamically manages the hardware and software
configuration of the device to adapt it at runtime to the required operating
mode. Our experimental results show that adapting the node setup to the
workload at runtime can save up to 50% power consumption. Our optimized and
quantized neural network reaches an accuracy value higher than 97% for
arrhythmia disorders detection on MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset.

balances expected performance and risk. To the best of our knowledge, PG-BROIL
is the first policy optimization algorithm robust to a distribution of reward
hypotheses which can scale to continuous MDPs. Results suggest that PG-BROIL
can produce a family of behaviors ranging from risk-neutral to risk-averse and
outperforms state-of-the-art imitation learning algorithms when learning from
ambiguous demonstrations by hedging against uncertainty, rather than seeking to
uniquely identify the demonstrator's reward function.

Therefore, the development of methodologies capable of quantifying and ranking

potential to facilitate better informed choices. Using survey data on
biosecurity practices, farm demographics, and previous outbreaks from 139
herds, a set of machine learning algorithms were trained to classify farms by
porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus status, depending on their
biosecurity practices, to produce a predicted outbreak risk. A novel
interpretable machine learning toolkit, MrIML-biosecurity, was developed to
benchmark farms and production systems by predicted risk, and quantify the
impact of biosecurity practices on disease risk at individual farms.
Quantifying the variable impact on predicted risk 50% of 42 variables were
associated with fomite spread while 31% were associated with local
transmission. Results from machine learning interpretations identified similar
results, finding substantial contribution to predicted outbreak risk from
biosecurity practices relating to: the turnover and number of employees; the
surrounding density of swine premises and pigs; the sharing of trailers;
distance from the public road; and production type. In addition, the
development of individualized biosecurity assessments provides the opportunity
to guide biosecurity implementation on a case-by-case basis. Finally, the
flexibility of the MrIML-biosecurity toolkit gives it potential to be applied
to wider areas of biosecurity benchmarking, to address weaknesses in other

estimating the value function of a given policy, which in turn is required to
find good policies. Generally speaking, TD learning updates states whenever

compute the TD-error, which is then propagated to other states. However, it may
be interesting, when computing updates, to take into account other information
than whether a state is visited or not. For example, some states might be more
important than others (such as states which are frequently seen in a successful
trajectory). Or, some states might have unreliable value estimates (for
example, due to partial observability or lack of data), making their values
less desirable as targets. We propose an approach to re-weighting states used

to steer the direction of the current flow. The ballistic electron current,
injected at one edge of the bottom layer, can be guided predominantly to one of
the lateral edges of the top layer. The current is steered to the opposite
lateral edge, if either the twist angle is reversed or the electrons are
injected in the valence band instead of the conduction band, making it possible
to control the current flow by electric gates. When both graphene layers are
aligned, the current passes straight through the system without changing its
initial direction. The observed steering angle exceeds well the twist angle and
emerges for a broad range of experimentally accessible parameters. It is
explained by the trigonal shape of the energy bands beyond the van Hove
singularity due to the Moir\'e interference pattern. As the shape of the energy
bands depends on the valley degree of freedom, the steered current is partially
valley polarized. Our findings show how to control and manipulate the current
flow in TBLG. Technologically, they are of relevance for applications in

evolve over time. For example, the estimated likelihood of rain on a specific
day changes by the hour as new information becomes available. Given a
collection of such probability paths, we introduce a Bayesian framework --
which we call the Gaussian latent information martingale, or GLIM -- for
modeling the structure of dynamic predictions over time. Suppose, for example,
that the likelihood of rain in a week is 50 %, and consider two hypothetical
scenarios. In the first, one expects the forecast to be equally likely to
become either 25 % or 75 % tomorrow; in the second, one expects the forecast to
stay constant for the next several days. A time-sensitive decision-maker might
select a course of action immediately in the latter scenario, but may postpone
their decision in the former, knowing that new information is imminent. We
model these trajectories by assuming predictions update according to a latent
process of information flow, which is inferred from historical data. In
contrast to general methods for time series analysis, this approach preserves
important properties of probability paths such as the martingale structure and
appropriate amount of volatility and better quantifies future uncertainties
around probability paths. We show that GLIM outperforms three popular baseline
methods, producing better estimated posterior probability path distributions

inclusion of protostellar outflows (1) reduces the star formation rate by a
factor of $\sim2$, (2) increases fragmentation, and (3) shifts the initial mass
function (IMF) to lower masses by a factor of $2.0\pm0.2$, without
significantly affecting the overall shape of the IMF. The form of the sink
particle (protostellar objects) mass distribution obtained from our simulations
matches the observational IMFs reasonably well. We also show that
turbulence-based theoretical models of the IMF agree well with our simulation
IMF in the high-mass and low-mass regime, but do not predict any brown dwarfs,
whereas our simulations produce a considerable number of sub-stellar objects,
which are produced by dynamical interactions (ejections). We find that these
dynamical interactions also play a key role for the binary separation
distribution and stellar kinematics in general. Our numerical model of star
cluster formation also reproduces the observed mass dependence of multiplicity.
Our multiplicity fraction estimates generally concur with the observational
estimates for different spectral types. We further calculate the specific
angular momentum of all the sink particles and find that the average value of
$1.5 \times 10^{19}\, \mathrm{cm^2\, s^{-1}}$ is consistent with observational
data. The specific angular momentum of our sink particles lies in the range
typical of protostellar envelopes and binaries. We conclude that the IMF is
controlled by a combination of gravity, turbulence, magnetic fields, radiation

setting -- Online Active Continual Adaptation, where the learner aims to
continually adapt to changing distributions using both unlabeled samples and
active queries of limited labels. To this end, we propose Online Self-Adaptive
Mirror Descent (OSAMD), which adopts an online teacher-student structure to

that decides whether to query the labels to track changing distributions.
Theoretically, we show that, in the separable case, OSAMD has an $O({T}^{2/3})$

$\Omega(T^{2/3})$ lower bound of online learning algorithms with full labels.
In the general case, we show a regret bound of $O({T}^{2/3} + \alpha^* T)$,
where $\alpha^*$ denotes the separability of domains and is usually small. Our
theoretical results show that OSAMD can fast adapt to changing environments

  Process Perspective","NeurIPS 2021",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Large width limits have been a recent focus of deep learning research: modulo
computational practicalities, do wider networks outperform narrower ones?
Answering this question has been challenging, as conventional networks gain
representational power with width, potentially masking any negative effects.
Our analysis in this paper decouples capacity and width via the generalization
of neural networks to Deep Gaussian Processes (Deep GP), a class of
nonparametric hierarchical models that subsume neural nets. In doing so, we aim
to understand how width affects (standard) neural networks once they have
sufficient capacity for a given modeling task. Our theoretical and empirical
results on Deep GP suggest that large width can be detrimental to hierarchical
models. Surprisingly, we prove that even nonparametric Deep GP converge to
Gaussian processes, effectively becoming shallower without any increase in
representational power. The posterior, which corresponds to a mixture of
data-adaptable basis functions, becomes less data-dependent with width. Our
tail analysis demonstrates that width and depth have opposite effects: depth
accentuates a model's non-Gaussianity, while width makes models increasingly
Gaussian. We find there is a ""sweet spot"" that maximizes test performance
before the limiting GP behavior prevents adaptability, occurring at width = 1
or width = 2 for nonparametric Deep GP. These results make strong predictions
about the same phenomenon in conventional neural networks trained with L2
regularization (analogous to a Gaussian prior on parameters): we show that such
neural networks may need up to 500 - 1000 hidden units for sufficient capacity
- depending on the dataset - but further width degrades performance.

penalizes sharp minimizers. Our analysis uncovers an additional regularization
effect of large learning rates beyond the linear scaling rule that penalizes
large eigenvalues of the Hessian more than small ones. We also prove extensions

evidence for lensed gravitational waves (GW) in the first half of the O3 run,
claiming ""We find the observation of lensed events to be unlikely, with the
fractional rate at $\mu>2$ being $3.3\times 10^{-4}$"". While we agree that the
chance of an individual GW event being lensed at $\mu>2$ is smaller than
$10^{-3}$, the number of observed events depends on the product of this small
probability times the rate of mergers at high redshift. Observational
constraints from the stochastic GW background indicate that the rate of
conventional mass BBH mergers (8 < M (M$_{\odot}$) < 15) in the redshift range
1<z< 2 could be as high as O($10^7$) events per year, more than sufficient to
compensate for the intrinsically low probability of lensing. To reach the LVC
trigger threshold these events require high magnification, but would still
produce up to 10 to 30 LVC observable events per year. Thus, all the LVC
observed ordinary stellar mass BBH mergers from this epoch must be strongly
lensed. By adopting low-rates at high redshift, LVC assumes that lensed events
can not be taking place, thus incorrectly assigning them a closer distance and
higher masses by a factor of a few (typically 2 to 5). The LVC adopted priors
on time delay are in tension with the distribution of observed time delays in
lensed quasars. Pairs of events like GW190421-GW190910 and GW190424-GW190910,
which are directly assigned a probability of zero by LVC, should be instead
considered as prime candidates to be strongly lensed GW pairs, since their
separation in time is consistent with observations of time delays in lensed
quasars. Correcting for the LVC wrong Bayesian priors, maximum merger rate of
conventional mass BBH in 1<z<2, and gravitational lensing time-delay model,
reverses the LVC conclusions and supports the strong gravitational lensing
hypothesis.

expected to increase and this phenomenon is known as solid solution
strengthening. However, reports on the ``anomalous'' softening with alloying
additions are not uncommon; for example, it is known that the heterogeneous
nucleation of dislocations at the sites of solute atoms can lead to softening.
In this study, using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, we show anomalous
softening in Cu-Al alloys deformed at 300 K; specifically, not only the yield
stress but also the magnitude of stress drop at yield decrease with increasing
Al content. We calculate the stress needed for the homogeneous nucleation of
partial dislocation loops using a continuum model. One of the key inputs to the
continuum model is the stacking fault energy (SFE). We carry out the
thermodynamic integration to evaluate the free energies in crystals with and
without the stacking faults and hence calculate the SFE as a function of Al
content at 300 K. Using the SFE values thus obtained we show that softening is
a consequence of the reduction of SFE values with the addition of Al in a
system where yielding is controlled by the nucleation of dislocation loops.
Specifically, the results of continuum model are in good agreement with MD
simulation results of pure copper. However, in the Cu-Al alloys, the drop in
yield strength can only be explained using a combination of the continuum model
(which assumes homogeneous nucleation), and the reduction in heterogeneous
nucleation barrier (which is a function of the ratio of the unstable and stable
stacking fault energies). We show that the decrease in stress drop can be
rationalised in terms of the stored energy available at yielding -- the stored
energy at yielding decreases with increasing Al, and, as a result, the maximum
dislocation density decreases with increasing Al content.

take advantage of small samples of naturally occurring rocks on Earth that have
been deep underground ($\gtrsim 5$ km), accumulating nuclear damage tracks from
recoiling nuclei for $\mathcal{O}(1)$ Gyr. Modern microscopy techniques promise
the capability to read out nuclear damage tracks with nanometer resolution in
macroscopic samples. Thanks to their $\mathcal{O}(1)$ Gyr integration times,
paleo-detectors could constitute nuclear recoil detectors with keV recoil
energy thresholds and 100 kilotonne-yr exposures. This combination would allow
paleo-detectors to probe DM-nucleon cross sections orders of magnitude below
existing upper limits from conventional direct detection experiments. In this
article, we use improved background modeling and a new spectral analysis
technique to update the sensitivity forecast for paleo-detectors. We
demonstrate the robustness of the sensitivity forecast to the (lack of)
ancillary measurements of the age of the samples and the parameters controlling
the backgrounds, systematic mismodeling of the spectral shape of the
backgrounds, and the radiopurity of the mineral samples. Specifically, we
demonstrate that even if the uranium concentration in paleo-detector samples is

the most radiopure samples obtained from ultra basic rock or marine evaporite
deposits, paleo-detectors could still probe DM-nucleon cross sections below
current limits. For DM masses $\lesssim 10$ GeV/$c^2$, the sensitivity of
paleo-detectors could still reach down all the way to the conventional neutrino

key challenges include (1) the dilemma of whether to explode the memory
consumption due to the huge joint space or achieve sub-optimal designs, (2) the
discrete nature of the accelerator design space that is coupled yet different
from that of the networks and bitwidths, and (3) the chicken and egg problem

operation-wise hardware cost, which is lacking during search as the optimal

localizing the optimal design within the huge joint design space for each

structure, eventually giving rise to the formation of a stellar disc. Stars
evolve and return chemically-processed gas and energy to the interstellar
medium, mainly through Type II supernova explosions. In the disc region, the
cosmological accretion of gas combines with the outflows resulting from
supernovae, affecting the hydrodynamical and structural properties of the disc
and producing gas flows in the vertical and radial directions. In this work, we
use a simulation of the Auriga Project, a suite of magneto-hydrodynamical,
zoom-in cosmological simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies, to study the

learning involves multiple energy-constrained devices, there is a huge scope to
leverage energy efficiency provided by SNNs. Despite its importance, there has
been little attention on training SNNs on a large-scale distributed system like
federated learning. In this paper, we bring SNNs to a more realistic federated

decentralized and privacy-preserving training of SNNs. To validate the proposed
federated learning framework, we experimentally evaluate the advantages of SNNs
on various aspects of federated learning with CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 benchmarks.
We observe that SNNs outperform ANNs in terms of overall accuracy by over 15%

while providing up to5.3x energy efficiency. In addition to efficiency, we also
analyze the sensitivity of the proposed federated SNN framework to data

fixed location when larger. Research on present-day devices has focused almost
exclusively on stabilisation of rotating modes, as it has been considered
imperative to avoid locked modes. However, in larger devices, stabilisation
during the rotating phase is made difficult by fast locking at small island
widths, and large broadening of the stabilising wave-driven current profile. In
contrast, the smaller island width at locking not only mitigates the
deleterious consequences of locked modes, but also permits their efficient
stabilisation. On large devices, it thus becomes surprisingly advantageous to
allow the mode to grow and lock naturally before stabilising it, challenging
the mainstream strategy of neoclassical tearing mode stabilisation during the
rotating phase. Calculations indicate that a locked island stabilisation
strategy should be adopted in the ITER tokamak, with a large potential impact
on the fusion gain and disruptivity.

shock-driven problem all the methods collapse to first-order. Study of the
decay of compressible homogeneous isotropic turbulence reveals that using a
high-order quadrature rule to compute the average over a finite volume cell
does not improve the spectral accuracy and that all methods present a
second-order convergence rate. However the choice of the numerical method to
reconstruct data at cell faces is found to be critical to correctly capture
turbulent spectra. In the context of simulations with finite-volume methods of
practical flows encountered in engineering applications, it becomes apparent
that an efficient strategy is to perform the average integration with a
low-order quadrature rule on a fine mesh resolution, whereas high-order schemes
should be used to reconstruct data at cell faces.

graph-based learning tasks by fusing network structure and node features.
Modern GNN models are built upon iterative aggregation of neighbor's/proximity
features by message passing. Its prediction performance has been shown to be
strongly bounded by assortative mixing in the graph, a key property wherein
nodes with similar attributes mix/connect with each other. We observe that real
world networks exhibit heterogeneous or diverse mixing patterns and the
conventional global measurement of assortativity, such as global assortativity
coefficient, may not be a representative statistic in quantifying this mixing.
We adopt a generalized concept, node-level assortativity, one that is based at
the node level to better represent the diverse patterns and accurately quantify
the learnability of GNNs. We find that the prediction performance of a wide
range of GNN models is highly correlated with the node level assortativity. To
break this limit, in this work, we focus on transforming the input graph into a
computation graph which contains both proximity and structural information as
distinct type of edges. The resulted multi-relational graph has an enhanced
level of assortativity and, more importantly, preserves rich information from
the original graph. We then propose to run GNNs on this computation graph and
show that adaptively choosing between structure and proximity leads to improved
performance under diverse mixing. Empirically, we show the benefits of adopting
our transformation framework for semi-supervised node classification task on a
variety of real world graph learning benchmarks.

coincident observation of the electromagnetic emission that followed. Although
only a $30\%$ measurement of the Hubble constant was achieved, future
observations may yield more precise measurements either through other
coincident events or through cross correlation of gravitational-wave events
with galaxy catalogs. Here, we implement a new way to measure the Hubble
constant without an electromagnetic counterpart and through the use of the
binary Love relations. These relations govern the tidal deformabilities of
neutron stars in an equation-of-state insensitive way. Importantly, the Love
relations depend on the component masses of the binary in the source frame.
Since the gravitational-wave phase and amplitude depend on the chirp mass in
the observer (and hence redshifted) frame, one can in principle combine the
binary Love relations with the gravitational-wave data to directly measure the
redshift, and thereby infer the value of the Hubble constant. We implement this
approach in both real and synthetic data through a Bayesian parameter
estimation study in a range of observing scenarios. We find that for the
LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA design sensitivity era, this method results in a similar
measurement accuracy of the Hubble constant to those of current-day, dark-siren
measurements. For third generation detectors, this accuracy improves to
$\lesssim 10\%$ when combining measurements from binary neutron star events in

that ET civilizations will be associated with star systems, we want to maximize
the number of stars that may be observed at one time. Assuming a representative
star density, this requires maximizing the search volume in a cone defined by
the detection range and field of view (FOV). The parameter trades are modified
from the case where one simply maximizes signal-to-noise ratio. Instead, a
joint optimization between FOV and sensitivity is needed. Some implications: 1)
Instead of focusing on the terrestrial microwave window of 1-10 GHz,
frequencies below 1 GHz may be optimal for detection rate due to the larger
field of view; 2) Arrays of smaller dishes should be favored compared to a
single dish of equivalent area; 3) Aperture arrays are desirable due to their
large potential FOV. Many radio telescopes under development will provide both
high sensitivity and large FOV, and should offer much improved SETI detection

relative importance of the prior and the likelihood, strongly linking the CPE
to the prior. Our results demonstrate how the CPE can arise in isolation from

used to improve operational safety, e.g., by triggering shutdown mechanisms or

close human-robot interaction pose new challenges to controller developers and

correctness of safety controllers under explicit (and preferably weak)

informed by the process, risk analysis, and relevant safety regulations for the
target application. Controllers are selected from a design space of feasible
controllers according to a set of optimality criteria, are formally verified
against correctness criteria, and are translated into executable code and
validated in a digital twin. The resulting controller can detect the occurrence
of hazards, move the process into a safe state, and, in certain circumstances,
return the process to an operational state from which it can resume its
original task. We show the effectiveness of our software engineering approach

such as invariant risk minimization (IRM) that seek to address
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization failures. Despite the promising
theory, invariance principle-based approaches fail in common classification
tasks, where invariant (causal) features capture all the information about the
label. Are these failures due to the methods failing to capture the invariance?
Or is the invariance principle itself insufficient? To answer these questions,
we revisit the fundamental assumptions in linear regression tasks, where
invariance-based approaches were shown to provably generalize OOD. In contrast
to the linear regression tasks, we show that for linear classification tasks we
need much stronger restrictions on the distribution shifts, or otherwise OOD
generalization is impossible. Furthermore, even with appropriate restrictions
on distribution shifts in place, we show that the invariance principle alone is
insufficient. We prove that a form of the information bottleneck constraint
along with invariance helps address key failures when invariant features
capture all the information about the label and also retains the existing
success when they do not. We propose an approach that incorporates both of
these principles and demonstrate its effectiveness in several experiments.

broad interest from the scientific community, with applications ranging from

unidirectionally from given nodes to other nodes. Nevertheless, most of the
work on cluster synchronization has focused on undirected networks. Here we
characterize cluster synchronization in general directed networks. Our first
observation is that, in directed networks, a cluster A of nodes might be
one-way dependent on another cluster B: in this case, A may remain synchronized
provided that B is stable, but the opposite does not hold. The main
contribution of this paper is a method to transform the cluster stability
problem in an irreducible form. In this way, we decompose the original problem
into subproblems of the lowest dimension, which allows us to immediately detect
inter-dependencies among clusters. We apply our analysis to two examples of
interest, a human network of violin players executing a musical piece for which
directed interactions may be either activated or deactivated by the musicians,
and a multilayer neural network with directed layer-to-layer connections.

discover mutually compatible policies. In contrast, independently trained
self-play policies are often mutually incompatible. Zero-shot coordination
(ZSC) has recently been proposed as a new frontier in multi-agent reinforcement
learning to address this fundamental issue. Prior work approaches the ZSC
problem by assuming players can agree on a shared learning algorithm but not on
labels for actions and observations, and proposes other-play as an optimal
solution. However, until now, this ""label-free"" problem has only been
informally defined. We formalize this setting as the label-free coordination
(LFC) problem by defining the label-free coordination game. We show that
other-play is not an optimal solution to the LFC problem as it fails to
consistently break ties between incompatible maximizers of the other-play
objective. We introduce an extension of the algorithm, other-play with
tie-breaking, and prove that it is optimal in the LFC problem and an
equilibrium in the LFC game. Since arbitrary tie-breaking is precisely what the
ZSC setting aims to prevent, we conclude that the LFC problem does not reflect
the aims of ZSC. To address this, we introduce an alternative informal
operationalization of ZSC as a starting point for future work.

exchange them in a way that is mutually beneficial until they reach a
competitive equilibrium (CE). The allocations at a CE are Pareto efficient and
fair. Consequently, they are used widely in designing mechanisms for fair

which are unknown in several applications of interest. In this work, we explore
a new online learning mechanism, which, on each round, allocates resources to
the agents and collects stochastic feedback on their experience in using that
allocation. Its goal is to learn the agent utilities via this feedback and
imitate the allocations at a CE in the long run. We quantify CE behavior via
two losses and propose a randomized algorithm which achieves sublinear loss
under a parametric class of utilities. Empirically, we demonstrate the

adversarial examples, has received significant attention as a means of
addressing security concerns in deep learning. However, for some classification
problems, local robustness is not a natural objective, even in the presence of
adversaries; for example, if an image contains two classes of subjects, the
correct label for the image may be considered arbitrary between the two, and
thus enforcing strict separation between them is unnecessary. In this work, we
introduce two relaxed safety properties for classifiers that address this
observation: (1) relaxed top-k robustness, which serves as the analogue of
top-k accuracy; and (2) affinity robustness, which specifies which sets of
labels must be separated by a robustness margin, and which can be
$\epsilon$-close in $\ell_p$ space. We show how to construct models that can be
efficiently certified against each relaxed robustness property, and trained
with very little overhead relative to standard gradient descent. Finally, we
demonstrate experimentally that these relaxed variants of robustness are
well-suited to several significant classification problems, leading to lower
rejection rates and higher certified accuracies than can be obtained when
certifying ""standard"" local robustness.

  The advent of quantum computing threatens internet protocols and blockchain
networks because they utilize non-quantum resistant cryptographic algorithms.
When quantum computers become robust enough to run Shor's algorithm on a large
scale, the most used asymmetric algorithms, utilized for digital signatures and
message encryption, such as RSA, (EC)DSA, and (EC)DH, will be no longer secure.
Quantum computers will be able to break them within a short period of time.
Similarly, Grover's algorithm concedes a quadratic advantage for mining blocks
in certain consensus protocols such as proof of work.

cryptocurrencies that rely on blockchain ledgers as well as the thousands of

reflection. In this work we investigate theoretically the reflectivity near the
critical angle at an interface with glass assuming the external medium has a
continuous depth-dependent refractive index. We present graphs of the internal
reflectivity as a function of the angle of incidence, which exhibit the effects
of a refractive-index gradient at the interface. We analyse the behaviour of
the reflectivity curves before total internal reflection is achieved. Our
results provide insight into how one can recognise the existence of a
refractive-index gradient at the interface and shed light on the viability of
characterising it.

using a zero forcing receiver. Motivated by Scalable Video Coding (SVC), we
consider successive refinement source coding in order to provide a ``softer''
tradeoff between the number of decoded ENs and the source distortion at each
user receiver. The resulting coding scheme can be seen as the concatenation of
Maddah-Ali and Niesen coded caching for each source-coded layer, and multiple
description coding. Using stochastic geometry, we investigate the tradeoff
between delivery time and per-user average source distortion. The proposed
system is spatially scalable in the sense that, for given users' and ENs'
spatial density, the achieved distortion-delivery time performance is
independent of the coverage area (for in the limit of large area).

nanoporous membrane one-sidedly surface-grafted with bendable organic chains.
Remarkably, through the membrane, gas spontaneously and repeatedly flows from
the low-pressure side to the high-pressure side. While this phenomenon seems
counterintuitive, it is compatible with the principle of maximum entropy. The
locally nonchaotic gate interrupts the probability distribution of the local
microstates, and imposes additional constraints on the global microstates, so
that entropy reaches a nonequilibrium maximum. Such a mechanism is
fundamentally different from Maxwell's demon and Feynman's ratchet, and is
consistent with microscopic reversibility. It implies that useful work may be
produced in a cycle from a single thermal reservoir. A generalized form of the
second law of thermodynamics is proposed.

processing task revealing the advantage of quantum communication protocols over
their classical counterpart. For a teleportation protocol using a Bell state as
quantum channel, the resource has been identified to be the concurrence.
However, for mixed multi-partite states the lack of computable entanglement
measures has made the identification of the quantum resource responsible for
this advantage more challenging. Here, by building on previous results showing
that localizable concurrence is the necessary resource for controlled quantum
teleportation, we show that any teleportation protocol using an arbitrary
multi-partite state, that includes a Bell measurement, requires a non-vanishing
localizable concurrence between two of its parties in order to perform better
than the classical protocol. By first analyzing the GHZ channel and GHZ
measurement teleportation protocol, in the presence of GHZ-symmetric-preserving
noise, we compare different multi-partite entanglement measures with the
fidelity of teleportation, and we find that the protocol performs better than
the classical protocol when all multi-partite entanglement measures vanish,
except for the localizable concurrence. Finally, we extend our proof to an
arbitrary teleportation protocol with an arbitrary multi-partite entangled
channel.

standardized 3D metric is yet missing, aggravating inter-study comparability
between different studies. Hence, evaluating human performance in virtual
environments is a long-standing research goal, and a performance metric that
combines two or more metrics under one formulation remains largely unexplored,
particularly in higher dimensions. The absence of such a metric is primarily
attributed to the discrepancies between pointing and manipulation, the complex
spatial variables in 3D, and the combination of translational and rotational
movements altogether. In this work, four experiments were designed and
conducted with progressively higher spatial complexity to study and compare
existing metrics thoroughly. The research goal was to quantify the difficulty
of these 3D tasks and model human performance sufficiently in full 3D
peripersonal space. Consequently, a new model extension has been proposed and
its applicability has been validated across all the experimental results,
showing improved modelling and representation of human performance in combined
movements of 3D object pointing and manipulation tasks than existing work.

design in virtual reality are discussed.

concentration, and the half mass scale, are essential in understanding the
formation of large-scale structure and dark matter halos. In this paper, we
study the impact of secondary halo properties on the galaxy-galaxy lensing
observable, $\Delta\Sigma$. We build an emulator trained on N-body simulations
to model $\Delta\Sigma$ and quantify the impact of different secondary
parameters on the $\Delta\Sigma$ profile. We focus on the impact of MAR on
$\Delta\Sigma$. We show that a 3$\sigma$ detection of variations in MAR at
fixed halo mass could be achieved with the Hyper Suprime Cam survey in
combination with a proxy for MAR with scatter
$\sigma_{\Gamma_\mathrm{dyn}|\mathrm{obs}}<1.5$. We show that the full radial
profile of $\Delta\Sigma$ depends on secondary properties at fixed halo mass.
Consequently, an emulator that can perform full shape fitting yields better
than 2 times improvement upon the constraints on MAR than only using the outer
part of the halo. Finally, we highlight that miscentering and MAR impact the
radial profile of $\Delta\Sigma$ in a similar fashion, implying that
miscentering and MAR need to be modeled jointly for unbiased estimates of both
effects. We show that present-day lensing data sets have the statistical
capability to place constraints on halo MAR. Our analysis opens up new
possibilities for observationally measuring the assembly history of the dark
matter halos that host galaxies and clusters.

reveal that, in general, finite-momentum excitons are actually well immune from
the exchange-induced valley depolarization, except for those with specific
exciton momenta coincident with the $3\sigma_v$ and $3C_2'$ symmetries in the
$D_{3h}$ point group of TMD-MLs. We reveal that, unlike the bright exciton
inevitably subjected to electron-hole exchange interaction, inter-valley
finite-momentum dark excitons in WSe$_2$-MLs are well immune from the
exchange-induced valley depolarization and inherently highly valley-polarized
under the enforcement of the crystal symmetries. More importantly, the superior
valley polarizations of the inter-valley dark excitons in WSe$_2$-MLs are shown
almost fully transferable to the optical polarization in the phonon-assisted
photo-luminescences because of the native suppression of exchange-induced
depolarization in the second-order optical processes. The analysis of
phonon-assisted photo-luminescences accounts for the recently observed

attack is performed by injecting adversarial nodes into it. We present an
analysis on the topological vulnerability of GNNs under GIA setting, based on
which we propose the Topological Defective Graph Injection Attack (TDGIA) for
effective injection attacks. TDGIA first introduces the topological defective
edge selection strategy to choose the original nodes for connecting with the
injected ones. It then designs the smooth feature optimization objective to
generate the features for the injected nodes. Extensive experiments on
large-scale datasets show that TDGIA can consistently and significantly
outperform various attack baselines in attacking dozens of defense GNN models.
Notably, the performance drop on target GNNs resultant from TDGIA is more than
double the damage brought by the best attack solution among hundreds of
submissions on KDD-CUP 2020.

mechanism in Geothermal Heat Pumps (GHPs) is indispensable to reduce the

Besides, in the Virtual Power Plant (VPP) system, the demand response of
clustered GHP systems can improve the operating flexibility of the power grid.
This paper presents an integration and operation framework of GHPs in the
distribution network, applying a layered communication and optimization method
to coordinate multiple clustered GHPs in a community. In the proposed
hierarchical operation scheme, the operator of regional GHPs collects the
thermal zone information and the disturbance prediction of buildings in a short
time granularity, predicts the energy demand, and transmits the information to
an aggregator. Using a novel linearized optimal power flow model, the
aggregator coordinates and aggregates load resources of GHP systems in the
distribution network. In this way, GHP systems with thermal and energy
management mechanisms can be applied to achieve the demand response in the VPP
and offer more energy flexibility to the community.

scratch, especially when training data is scarce and computation power is
limited. In deep learning, a typical strategy for transfer learning is to
freeze the early layers of a pre-trained model and fine-tune the rest of its
layers on the target domain. Previous work focuses on the accuracy of the
transferred model but neglects the transfer of adversarial robustness. In this
work, we first show that transfer learning improves the accuracy on the target
domain but degrades the inherited robustness of the target model. To address
such a problem, we propose a novel cooperative adversarially-robust transfer
learning (CARTL) by pre-training the model via feature distance minimization
and fine-tuning the pre-trained model with non-expansive fine-tuning for target
domain tasks. Empirical results show that CARTL improves the inherited
robustness by about 28% at most compared with the baseline with the same degree
of accuracy. Furthermore, we study the relationship between the batch
normalization (BN) layers and the robustness in the context of transfer
learning, and we reveal that freezing BN layers can further boost the
robustness transfer.

  activations in individuals and groups","44 pages, 24 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The general linear model (GLM) is a widely popular and convenient tool for
estimating the functional brain response and identifying areas of significant
activation during a task or stimulus. However, the classical GLM is based on a
massive univariate approach that does not explicitly leverage the similarity of
activation patterns among neighboring brain locations. As a result, it tends to
produce noisy estimates and be underpowered to detect significant activations,
particularly in individual subjects and small groups. A recent alternative, a
cortical surface-based spatial Bayesian GLM, leverages spatial dependencies
among neighboring cortical vertices to produce more accurate estimates and
areas of functional activation. The spatial Bayesian GLM can be applied to
individual and group-level analysis. In this study, we assess the reliability
and power of individual and group-average measures of task activation produced
via the surface-based spatial Bayesian GLM. We analyze motor task data from 45
subjects in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and HCP Retest datasets. We also
extend the model to multi-run analysis and employ subject-specific cortical
surfaces rather than surfaces inflated to a sphere for more accurate
distance-based modeling. Results show that the surface-based spatial Bayesian
GLM produces highly reliable activations in individual subjects and is powerful
enough to detect trait-like functional topologies. Additionally, spatial
Bayesian modeling enhances reliability of group-level analysis even in
moderately sized samples (n=45). The power of the spatial Bayesian GLM to
detect activations above a scientifically meaningful effect size is nearly
invariant to sample size, exhibiting high power even in small samples (n=10).
The spatial Bayesian GLM is computationally efficient in individuals and groups
and is convenient to implement with the open-source BayesfMRI R package.

Sitter (dS) connection and the gravitational Higgs/Goldstone field $\xi^A$.
Previously, a model for DGT was analyzed, which generalizes the
MacDowell--Mansouri gravity to have a variable cosmological constant
$\Lambda=3/l^2$, where $l$ is related to $\xi^A$ by $\xi^A\xi_A=l^2$. It was
shown that the model sourced by a perfect fluid does not support a radiation
epoch and the accelerated expansion of the parity invariant universe. In this
work, I consider a similar model, namely, the Stelle--West gravity, and couple
it to a modified perfect fluid, such that the total Lagrangian 4-form is
polynomial in the gravitational variables. The Lagrangian of the modified fluid
has a nontrivial variational derivative with respect to $l$, and as a result,
the problems encountered in the previous work no longer appear. Moreover, to
explore the elegance of the general theory, as well as to write down the basic
framework, I perform the Lagrange--Noether analysis for DGT sourced by a matter
field, yielding the field equations and the identities with respect to the
symmetries of the system. The resulted formula are dS covariant and do not rely
on the existence of the metric field.

settings, we formally initiate a study of $semi-supervised$ $active$ $learning$
through the frame of linear regression. In this setting, the learner has access
to a dataset $X \in \mathbb{R}^{(n_1+n_2) \times d}$ which is composed of $n_1$
unlabelled examples that an algorithm can actively query, and $n_2$ examples
labelled a-priori. Concretely, denoting the true labels by $Y \in

important special cases: (i) active ridge regression, and (ii) active kernel
ridge regression, where the reduced-rank equates to the statistical dimension,

numerical method is to solve a highly non-convex empirical risk minimization
problem subjected to a solution from a hypothesis space of neural networks. In
a well-posed elliptic PDE setting, when the hypothesis space consists of neural
networks with either infinite width or depth, we show that the global minimizer

capabilities towards connecting images and natural language. The textual
representations in English can be desirably transferred to multilingualism and
support downstream multimodal tasks for different languages. Nevertheless, the
principle of multilingual fairness is rarely scrutinized: do multilingual
multimodal models treat languages equally? Are their performances biased
towards particular languages? To answer these questions, we view language as
the fairness recipient and introduce two new fairness notions, multilingual
individual fairness and multilingual group fairness, for pre-trained multimodal
models. Multilingual individual fairness requires that text snippets expressing
similar semantics in different languages connect similarly to images, while
multilingual group fairness requires equalized predictive performance across
languages. We characterize the extent to which pre-trained multilingual
vision-and-language representations are individually fair across languages.
However, extensive experiments demonstrate that multilingual representations do
not satisfy group fairness: (1) there is a severe multilingual accuracy
disparity issue; (2) the errors exhibit biases across languages conditioning
the group of people in the images, including race, gender and age.

We introduce a
model that relates quark wave functions in a baryon and the occupation
probability of states for baryons and quarks in dense matter. In a dilute
regime, the confined quarks contribute to the energy density through the masses
of baryons, but do not directly contribute to the pressure; hence, the
equations of state are very soft. This dilute regime continues until the low
momentum states for quarks get saturated; this may happen even before baryons
fully overlap, possibly at density slightly above the nuclear saturation
density. After the saturation the pressure grows rapidly while changes in
energy density are modest, producing a peak in the speed of sound. If we use
baryonic descriptions for quark distributions near the Fermi surface, we reach
a description similar to the quarkyonic matter model of McLerran and Reddy.
With a simple adjustment of quark interactions to get the nucleon mass, our
model becomes consistent with the constraints from 1.4-solar mass neutron
stars, but the high density part is too soft to account for two-solar mass
neutron stars. We delineate the relation between the saturation effects and
short range interactions of quarks, suggesting interactions that leave low
density equations of state unchanged but stiffen the high density part.

develop a time-efficient, computationally less loaded, and high-performing

standard and depth-wise convolution for increasing the performance and followed
by separable convolution to decrease the number of parameters which maintains
the tradeoff between time and performance. We experiment on open access EEG

We compare performance with six commonly used machine learning classifiers and
four state of the art deep learning models. We attain comparable performance
utilizing less than 4\% of the parameters of other models. This model can be
employed in a real-time computation environment such as neurofeedback.

detected, with an absolute U-band magnitude brighter than -22.0 mag and a total
bolometric luminosity >1.0x10^{44} erg/s near maximum light. The early-time
spectra of this SN are characterized by a blue continuum on which are
superimposed narrow P~Cygni profile lines of He I, suggesting the presence of
slowly moving (~1000 km/s), He-rich circumstellar material (CSM). At 1--2
months after maximum brightness, the He I line profiles become only slightly
broader, with blueshifted velocities of 2000--3000 km/s, consistent with the
CSM shell being continuously accelerated by the SN light and ejecta. Like most
SNe~Ibn, the light curves of ASASSN-14ms show rapid post-peak evolution,
dropping by ~7 mag in the V band over three months. Such a rapid post-peak
decline and high luminosity can be explained with interaction between SN ejecta
and helium-rich CSM of 0.9~M_{\odot} at a distance of~10^{15} cm. The CSM
around ASASSN-14ms is estimated to originate from a pre-explosion event with a
mass-loss rate of 6.7~M_\odot /yr (assuming a velocity of ~1000 km/s), which is
consistent with abundant He-rich material violently ejected during the late
Wolf-Rayet (WN9-11 or Opfe) stage. After examining the light curves for a
sample of SNe~Ibn, we find that the more luminous ones tend to have slower
post-peak decline rates, reflecting that the observed differences may arise
primarily from discrepancies in the CSM distribution around the massive
progenitors.

microscopic-imaging technique to simultaneously measure the thickness and
refractive index of thin layers in a spatially resolved manner using
reflectometry. The heterodyne-detected interference between a light field
reflected by the sample and a reference field allows measurement of the
amplitude and phase of the reflected field and thus determination of the
complex reflection coefficient. Comparing the results with the simulated
reflection of a thin layer under coherent illumination of high numerical

with its hot environment, while a projective measurement of the internal state

we construct the Ruppeiner geometry for the Kerr-AdS black hole by making the
use of the Christodoulou-Ruffini-like squared-mass formula, which is quite
different from the charged case. Employing the empirical observation of the
corresponding scalar curvature, we find that, for the near-extremal Kerr-AdS

for far-from-extremal Kerr-AdS black hole, the attractive interaction
dominates. The critical phenomenon is also observed for the scalar curvature.
These results uncover the characteristic microstructure of the Kerr-AdS black

field in convolution operation. Inspired by the success of Transformer in
modeling the long-range contextual information, some researchers have expended
considerable efforts in designing the robust variants of Transformer-based
U-Net. Moreover, the patch division used in vision transformers usually ignores
the pixel-level intrinsic structural features inside each patch. To alleviate
these problems, we propose a novel deep medical image segmentation framework
called Dual Swin Transformer U-Net (DS-TransUNet), which might be the first
attempt to concurrently incorporate the advantages of hierarchical Swin
Transformer into both encoder and decoder of the standard U-shaped architecture
to enhance the semantic segmentation quality of varying medical images. Unlike
many prior Transformer-based solutions, the proposed DS-TransUNet first adopts
dual-scale encoder subnetworks based on Swin Transformer to extract the coarse
and fine-grained feature representations of different semantic scales. As the
core component for our DS-TransUNet, a well-designed Transformer Interactive
Fusion (TIF) module is proposed to effectively establish global dependencies
between features of different scales through the self-attention mechanism.
Furthermore, we also introduce the Swin Transformer block into decoder to
further explore the long-range contextual information during the up-sampling
process. Extensive experiments across four typical tasks for medical image
segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness of DS-TransUNet, and show that our
approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

To overcome this, CDNs are built on top of the Internet as an overlay to
efficiently store and swiftly disseminate contents to users by placing many
servers and data centers around the globe. The topic of CDNs has been
extensively studied in the last several decades. However, there is still a
certain gap between theories in academia and current technologies in industry.
In this paper, we take a close look at the design, implementation, solution,
and performance of a CDN system by analyzing its raw log files. Specifically,
its infrastructure and system design are first presented, and then we conduct a
trace-based study to understand user access patterns, the sources of requests,
system performance, and how such information can be used to improve the whole
CDN system.

  Recommendation","26 pages",,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the flexibility in modelling data heterogeneity, heterogeneous
information network (HIN) has been adopted to characterize complex and
heterogeneous auxiliary data in top-$N$ recommender systems, called
\emph{HIN-based recommendation}. HIN characterizes complex, heterogeneous data
relations, containing a variety of information that may not be related to the
recommendation task. Therefore, it is challenging to effectively leverage
useful information from HINs for improving the recommendation performance. To
address the above issue, we propose a Curriculum pre-training based
HEterogeneous Subgraph Transformer (called \emph{CHEST}) with new \emph{data
characterization}, \emph{representation model} and \emph{learning algorithm}.
  Specifically, we consider extracting useful information from HIN to compose
the interaction-specific heterogeneous subgraph, containing both sufficient and
relevant context information for recommendation. Then we capture the rich
semantics (\eg graph structure and path semantics) within the subgraph via a
heterogeneous subgraph Transformer, where we encode the subgraph with
multi-slot sequence representations. Besides, we design a curriculum
pre-training strategy to provide an elementary-to-advanced learning process, by
which we smoothly transfer basic semantics in HIN for modeling user-item
interaction relation.
  Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our proposed method over a number of competitive baselines,
especially when only limited training data is available.

novel possibilities of having bound states in continuum, albeit in the limit of
vanishing losses. It is shown that the corresponding dispersion branches of the

noncentrosymmetric bilayer (BL) and four-layer (FL) PdS$_2$ and PdSe$_2$ by
applying the first-principles density functional theory with the generalized

susceptibilities are in the order of 100$\times$10$^8$A/V$^2$s, again being
large. Secondly, the SHG coefficients ($\chi^{(2)}$) of these materials are
also large, being one order higher than that of the best-known few-layer group
6B transition metal dichalcogenides. For example, the maximum magnitude of
$\chi^{(2)}$ can reach 1.4$\times$10$^3$ pm/V for BL PdSe$_2$ at 1.9 eV and
1.2$\times$10$^3$ pm/V at 3.1 eV for BL PdS$_2$. Thirdly we find significant

2D quantum confinement.

acceleration and image quality. Image reconstruction and super-resolution are
two crucial techniques in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Current methods are
designed to perform these tasks separately, ignoring the correlations between
them. In this work, we propose an end-to-end task transformer network
(T$^2$Net) for joint MRI reconstruction and super-resolution, which allows
representations and feature transmission to be shared between multiple task to
achieve higher-quality, super-resolved and motion-artifacts-free images from
highly undersampled and degenerated MRI data. Our framework combines both
reconstruction and super-resolution, divided into two sub-branches, whose
features are expressed as queries and keys. Specifically, we encourage joint
feature learning between the two tasks, thereby transferring accurate task
information. We first use two separate CNN branches to extract task-specific
features. Then, a task transformer module is designed to embed and synthesize
the relevance between the two tasks. Experimental results show that our
multi-task model significantly outperforms advanced sequential methods, both
quantitatively and qualitatively.

and the main cause of dementia in aging. Hippocampus is prone to changes in the
early stages of Alzheimers disease. Detection and observation of the
hippocampus changes using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before the onset of
Alzheimers disease leads to the faster preventive and therapeutic measures.
Objective: The aim of this study was the segmentation of the hippocampus in
magnetic resonance (MR) images of Alzheimers patients using deep machine
learning method. Methods: U-Net architecture of convolutional neural network
was proposed to segment the hippocampus in the real MRI data. The MR images of
the 100 and 35 patients available in Alzheimers disease Neuroimaging Initiative
(ADNI) dataset, was used for the train and test of the model, respectively. The
performance of the proposed method was compared with manual segmentation by
measuring the similarity metrics. Results: The desired segmentation achieved
after 10 iterations. A Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) = 92.3%, sensitivity =
96.5%, positive predicted value (PPV) = 90.4%, and Intersection over Union
(IoU) value for the train 92.94 and test 92.93 sets were obtained which are
acceptable. Conclusion: The proposed approach is promising and can be extended
in the prognosis of Alzheimers disease by the prediction of the hippocampus
volume changes in the early stage of the disease.

  Lung Cancer Survival Analysis","7 Submitted to IEEE TBME",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. The critical
reason for the deaths is delayed diagnosis and poor prognosis. With the
accelerated development of deep learning techniques, it has been successfully
applied extensively in many real-world applications, including health sectors
such as medical image interpretation and disease diagnosis. By combining more
modalities that being engaged in the processing of information, multimodal
learning can extract better features and improve predictive ability. The
conventional methods for lung cancer survival analysis normally utilize
clinical data and only provide a statistical probability. To improve the
survival prediction accuracy and help prognostic decision-making in clinical
practice for medical experts, we for the first time propose a multimodal deep
learning method for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) survival analysis, named
DeepMMSA. This method leverages CT images in combination with clinical data,
enabling the abundant information hold within medical images to be associate
with lung cancer survival information. We validate our method on the data of
422 NSCLC patients from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Experimental results
support our hypothesis that there is an underlying relationship between
prognostic information and radiomic images. Besides, quantitative results
showing that the established multimodal model can be applied to traditional
method and has the potential to break bottleneck of existing methods and
increase the the percentage of concordant pairs(right predicted pairs) in

interacting system composed of two qubits and an oscillator with the presence
of a parametric medium. To analytically solve the system, we employ the
adiabatic approximation approach. It assumes each qubit's characteristic
frequency is substantially lower than the oscillator frequency. To validate our
approximation, a good agreement between the calculated energy spectrum of the
Hamiltonian with its numerical result is presented. The time evolution of the
reduced density matrices of the two-qubit and the oscillator subsystems are
computed from the tripartite initial state. Starting with a factorized
two-qubit initial state, the quasi-periodicity in the revival and collapse
phenomenon that occurs in the two-qubit population inversion is studied. Based
on the measure of relative entropy of coherence, we investigate the quantum
coherence and its explicit dependence on the parametric term both for the
two-qubit and the individual qubit subsystems by adopting different choices of
the initial states. Similarly, the existence of quantum correlations is
demonstrated by studying the geometric discord and concurrence. Besides, by
numerically minimizing the Hilbert-Schmidt distance, the dynamically produced
near maximally entangled states are reconstructed. The reconstructed states are
observed to be nearly pure generalized Bell states. Furthermore, utilizing the
oscillator density matrix, the quadrature variance and phase-space distribution
of the associated Husimi $Q$-function are computed in the minimum entropy

Wave (FMCW) radar system with a dechirping receiver is investigated. After
dechirping operation, the scattered signals from targets result in beat
signals, i.e., the sum of complex exponentials while the interferences lead to
chirp-like short pulses. Taking advantage of these different time and frequency
features between the useful signals and the interferences, the interference
mitigation is formulated as an optimization problem: a sparse and low-rank
decomposition of a Hankel matrix constructed by lifting the measurements. Then,
an iterative optimization algorithm is proposed to tackle it by exploiting the
Alternating Direction of Multipliers (ADMM) scheme. Compared to the existing
methods, the proposed approach does not need to detect the interference and
also improves the estimation accuracy of the separated useful signals. Both
numerical simulations with point-like targets and experiment results with

its performance. The results show that the proposed approach is generally
applicable for interference mitigation in both stationary and moving target
scenarios.

plain stochastic gradient descent has not been corrected by the accumulated
gradient. For the parameters that currently need to be updated, it is the
optimal direction, and its update is more accurate. We combine the advantages
of the momentum stochastic gradient descent with fast training speed and the
plain stochastic gradient descent with high accuracy, and propose a scaling
transition from momentum stochastic gradient descent to plain stochastic
gradient descent(TSGD) method. At the same time, a learning rate that decreases
linearly with the iterations is used instead of a constant learning rate. The
TSGD algorithm has a larger step size in the early stage to speed up the
training, and training with a smaller step size in the later stage can steadily
converge. Our experimental results show that the TSGD algorithm has faster

Cell swimming generates fluid flow which leads to effective repulsions between

suppresses density fluctuations and generates disordered hyperuniform states

individual agents to make contributions that, while costly for each of them,
benefit the wider society. In this work, we adopt the perspective of a central
planner with a global view of a network of self-interested agents and the goal
of maximizing some desired property in the context of a best-shot public goods
game. Existing algorithms for this known NP-complete problem find solutions
that are sub-optimal and cannot optimize for criteria other than social
welfare.
  In order to efficiently solve public goods games, our proposed method
directly exploits the correspondence between equilibria and the Maximal
Independent Set (mIS) structural property of graphs. In particular, we define a
Markov Decision Process which incrementally generates an mIS, and adopt a
planning method to search for equilibria, outperforming existing methods.
Furthermore, we devise a graph imitation learning technique that uses
demonstrations of the search to obtain a graph neural network parametrized
policy which quickly generalizes to unseen game instances. Our evaluation
results show that this policy is able to reach 99.5% of the performance of the
planning method while being three orders of magnitude faster to evaluate on the
largest graphs tested. The methods presented in this work can be applied to a
large class of public goods games of potentially high societal impact and more
broadly to other graph combinatorial optimization problems.

graph, a budget of modifications, and a global objective function, the aim is
to find a set of edges whose addition to the graph achieves the maximum
improvement in the objective (e.g., communication efficiency). This problem
emerges in many networks of great importance for society such as transportation
and critical infrastructure networks. We identify two significant shortcomings
with present methods. Firstly, they focus exclusively on network topology while
ignoring spatial information; however, in many real-world networks, nodes are
embedded in space, which yields different global objectives and governs the
range and density of realizable connections. Secondly, existing RL methods
scale poorly to large networks due to the high cost of training a model and the
scaling factors of the action space and global objectives.

Monte Carlo Tree Search framework for planning in this domain, prioritizing the
optimality of final solutions over the speed of policy evaluation. We propose
several improvements over the standard UCT algorithm for this family of

Electroencephalograph (EEG), which can monitor the electrical activity of the

critical challenges is that individual differences may cause ineffective
results, especially when the established model meets an unfamiliar subject. In
this work, we propose a cross-subject deep adaptation model with spatial
attention (CS-DASA) to generalize the workload classifications across subjects.
First, we transform EEG time series into multi-frame EEG images incorporating
spatial, spectral, and temporal information. First, the Subject-Shared module
in CS-DASA receives multi-frame EEG image data from both source and target
subjects and learns the common feature representations. Then, in the
subject-specific module, the maximum mean discrepancy is implemented to measure
the domain distribution divergence in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, which
can add an effective penalty loss for domain adaptation. Additionally, the
subject-to-subject spatial attention mechanism is employed to focus on the
discriminative spatial features from the target image data. Experiments
conducted on a public WM EEG dataset containing 13 subjects show that the
proposed model is capable of achieving better performance than existing
state-of-the-art methods.

Still, a growing body of work keeps leveraging this approximation to

determine the practical validity of such approximation by conducting a
systematic comparison of the behavior of different neural networks and their
linear approximations on different tasks. We show that the linear
approximations can indeed rank the learning complexity of certain tasks for
neural networks, even when they achieve very different performances. However,
in contrast to what was previously reported, we discover that neural networks
do not always perform better than their kernel approximations, and reveal that
the performance gap heavily depends on architecture, dataset size and training

vertices to leaves. This leads to a growth model based on vertex clusters and
probabilities assigned to clusters. This model turns out to be readily
applicable to attachment at any depth of the tree, hence the paper evolves to a
general study of tree growth by cluster-based attachment. Drawing inspiration
from the concept of intrinsic vertex fitness due to Bianconi and Barab\'asi, we
introduce vertex mass as an additive intrinsic vertex attribute. Unlike
Bianconi and Barab\'asi who used fitness as a vertex degree multiplier in the
context of growth by preferential attachment, we treat vertex mass as a
fundamental probabilistic construct whose additivity plays a primary role.
Notably, independent mass distributions induce a distribution on the sum of
such masses through Laplace convolution. In this way, clusters of vertices
inherit their mass distributions from vertices within the cluster.
  Our main contribution is a novel theorem for the joint distribution of
cluster masses, conditioned on their respective distributions. As described by
Ferguson and Kingman in the context of distributions on general measures, the
choice of gamma conditioning distributions leads to the Dirichlet distribution.
Beyond gamma conditioning distributions, our theorem allows other choices, such
as the fat-tailed stable distributions with infinite mean. We discuss L\'evy
conditioning distributions as a gamma alternative, the L\'evy distribution
being a notable instance of the stable family. We conclude with a theorem
giving the analytic marginals of the normalised distribution conditioned on the

reflected in billions of historical documents that have been preserved.
However, the change in Japanese writing system in 1900 made these documents
inaccessible for the general public. A major research project has been to make
these historical documents accessible and understandable. An increasing amount
of research has focused on the character recognition task and the location of
characters on image, yet less research has focused on how to predict the
sequential ordering of the characters. This is because sequence in classical
Japanese is very different from modern Japanese. Ordering characters into a
sequence is important for making the document text easily readable and
searchable. Additionally, it is a necessary step for any kind of natural
language processing on the data (e.g. machine translation, language modeling,
and word embeddings). We explore a few approaches to the task of predicting the
sequential ordering of the characters: one using simple hand-crafted rules,
another using hand-crafted rules with adaptive thresholds, and another using a
deep recurrent sequence model trained with teacher forcing. We provide a
quantitative and qualitative comparison of these techniques as well as their
distinct trade-offs. Our best-performing system has an accuracy of 98.65\% and
has a perfect accuracy on 49\% of the books in our dataset, suggesting that the

Moreover, the learngene, i.e., the gene for learning initialization rules of

Particularly, a novel criterion is proposed to discover learngene in the

scenarios encompass some of the most challenging scenarios that wireless

considerable increase in the system throughput given the outdoor environment.

18 % and above. These devices benefit from the suppression of free charge
recombination with regard to the Langevin-limit of charge encounter in a
homogeneous medium. It has been recognized that the main cause of suppressed
free charge recombination is the reformation and resplitting of charge transfer
states at the interface between donor and acceptor domains. Here, we use
kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to understand the interplay between free charge
motion and recombination in an energetically-disordered phase-separated
donor-acceptor blend. We identify conditions for encounter-dominated and
resplitting-dominated recombination. In the former regime, recombination is
proportional to mobility for all parameters tested and only slightly reduced
with respect to the Langevin limit. In contrast, mobility is not the decisive
parameter determining the non-geminate recombination coefficient k_2in the
latter case where k_2 is a sole function of the morphology, CT and CS
energetics and CT states decay properties. Our simulations also show that free
charge encounter in the phase-separated disordered blend is determined by the
average mobility of all carriers, while CT reformation and resplitting involves
mostly states near the transport energy. Therefore, charge encounter is more
affected by increased disorder than the resplitting of the CT state. As a
consequence, for a given mobility, larger energetic disorder in combination
with a higher hopping rate is preferred. These findings have important
implications for the understanding of suppressed recombination in solar cells
with non-fullerene acceptors which are known to exhibit lower energetic
disorder than fullerenes.

that the theory can capture some structural information of the orbifold. We can
prove that st-homology is an invariant under orbifold isomorphisms and more
generally under weight-preserving homotopy equivalences. It turns out that the
free part of st-homology of an orbifold can be computed from the usual
simplicial homology of the orbifold. So it is the torsion part of st-homology
that can really give us new information of an orbifold. In general, the size of
the torsion in the st-homology group of a compact orbifold is a nonlinear
function of the orders of the local groups of an orbifold, which may reflect
the correlations between its singular points. Moreover, we introduce a wider

encourages inter-class separability and intra-class compactness in learned
image representations. Since medical images often contain multiple semantic
classes in an image, using CL to learn representations of local features (as
opposed to global) is important. In this work, we present a novel
semi-supervised 2D medical segmentation solution that applies CL on image
patches, instead of full images. These patches are meaningfully constructed
using the semantic information of different classes obtained via pseudo
labeling. We also propose a novel consistency regularization (CR) scheme, which
works in synergy with CL. It addresses the problem of confirmation bias, and
encourages better clustering in the feature space. We evaluate our method on
four public medical segmentation datasets and a novel histopathology dataset
that we introduce. Our method obtains consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation approaches for all datasets.

shrinking profit margins in the energy markets let wind farm managers explore

Sensor-based condition monitoring facilitates remote diagnostics of turbine
subsystems, enabling faster responses when unforeseen maintenance is required.
Condition monitoring with data from the turbines' supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) systems was proposed and SCADA-based fault detection and
diagnosis approaches introduced based on single-task normal operation models of
turbine state variables. As the number of SCADA channels has grown strongly,
thousands of independent single-target models are in place today for monitoring
a single turbine. Multi-target learning was recently proposed to limit the
number of models. This study applied multi-target neural networks to the task
of early fault detection in drive-train components. The accuracy and delay of
detecting gear bearing faults were compared to state-of-the-art single-target
approaches. We found that multi-target multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) detected
faults at least as early and in many cases earlier than single-target MLPs. The
multi-target MLPs could detect faults up to several days earlier than the
single-target models. This can deliver a significant advantage in the planning
and performance of maintenance work. At the same time, the multi-target MLPs
achieved the same level of prediction stability.

growing models to sizes previously thought to be unreasonable. Recent work has
shown that autoregressive generative models with cross-entropy objective
functions exhibit smooth power-law relationships, or scaling laws, that predict
model quality from model size, training set size, and the available compute
budget. These scaling laws allow one to choose nearly optimal hyper-parameters
given constraints on available training data, model parameter count, or
training computation budget. In this paper, we demonstrate that acoustic models
trained with an auto-predictive coding loss behave as if they are subject to
similar scaling laws. We extend previous work to jointly predict loss due to
model size, to training set size, and to the inherent ""irreducible loss"" of the
task. We find that the scaling laws accurately match model performance over two
orders of magnitude in both model size and training set size, and make
predictions about the limits of model performance.

normalize E-commerce attribute values (e.g. ""Win 10 Pro"") to a fixed set of
pre-defined canonical values (e.g. ""Windows 10""). Earlier works on attribute
normalization focused on fuzzy string matching (also referred as syntactic
matching in this paper). In this work, we first perform an extensive study of
nine syntactic matching algorithms and establish that 'cosine' similarity leads
to best results, showing 2.7% improvement over commonly used Jaccard index.
Next, we argue that string similarity alone is not sufficient for attribute
normalization as many surface forms require going beyond syntactic matching
(e.g. ""720p"" and ""HD"" are synonyms). While semantic techniques like
unsupervised embeddings (e.g. word2vec/fastText) have shown good results in
word similarity tasks, we observed that they perform poorly to distinguish
between close canonical forms, as these close forms often occur in similar
contexts. We propose to learn token embeddings using a twin network with
triplet loss. We propose an embedding learning task leveraging raw attribute
values and product titles to learn these embeddings in a self-supervised
fashion. We show that providing supervision using our proposed task improves
over both syntactic and unsupervised embeddings based techniques for attribute
normalization. Experiments on a real-world attribute normalization dataset of
50 attributes show that the embeddings trained using our proposed approach
obtain 2.3% improvement over best string matching and 19.3% improvement over
best unsupervised embeddings.

environment. As the view of cognitive neuroscience, visual depth perception
methods are divided into three categories, namely binocular, active, and
pictorial. The first two categories have been studied for decades in detail.
However, research for the exploration of the third category is still in its
infancy and has got momentum by the advent of deep learning methods in recent
years. In cognitive neuroscience, it is known that pictorial depth perception
mechanisms are dependent on the perception of seen objects. Inspired by this
fact, in this thesis, we investigated the relation of perception of objects and
depth estimation convolutional neural networks. For this purpose, we developed
new network structures based on a simple depth estimation network that only
used a single image at its input. Our proposed structures use both an image and
a semantic label of the image as their input. We used semantic labels as the
output of object perception. The obtained results of performance comparison
between the developed network and original network showed that our novel
structures can improve the performance of depth estimation by 52\% of relative
error of distance in the examined cases. Most of the experimental studies were
carried out on synthetic datasets that were generated by game engines to
isolate the performance comparison from the effect of inaccurate depth and
semantic labels of non-synthetic datasets. It is shown that particular
synthetic datasets may be used for training of depth networks in cases that an
appropriate dataset is not available. Furthermore, we showed that in these
cases, usage of semantic labels improves the robustness of the network against
domain shift from synthetic training data to non-synthetic test data.
