To this aim we use the on-shell effective field theory, amended with mass
corrections. We also carry out the computation using transport theory, reaching
to the same result. Interemediate steps in the computations reveal the presence
of potential infrared divergencies. We use dimensional regularization, as it is
respectful with the gauge symmetry, and then show that all infrared

both the power and two-loop corrections, and claim that they are equally
important if the mass is soft, that is, of order $e T$ (or $e \mu$), where $e$
is the gauge coupling constant, but are dominat if the mass obeys $ e T < m \ll

propose to build a Pyramid Generator by stacking several sub-generators, where
lower-layer sub-generators focus on restoring image structures while the
higher-layer sub-generators emphasize image details. Given an input image, it
will be gradually restored by going through the entire pyramid in a bottom-up
fashion. Particularly, our approach has a learning scheme of progressively
increasing hole size, which allows it to restore large-hole images. In
addition, our method could fully exploit the benefits of learning with
high-resolution images, and hence is suitable for high-resolution image
inpainting. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets have validated
the effectiveness of our approach compared with state-of-the-art methods.

conceptually simple, but errors propagate from one component to the next,
without later components being able to revise earlier decisions. We present an
architecture for joint document and snippet ranking, the two middle stages,
which leverages the intuition that relevant documents have good snippets and
good snippets come from relevant documents. The architecture is general and can
be used with any neural text relevance ranker. We experiment with two main
instantiations of the architecture, based on POSIT-DRMM (PDRMM) and a

joint models vastly outperform the pipelines in snippet retrieval, the main

document retrieval. Furthermore, our joint PDRMM-based model is competitive
with BERT-based models, despite using orders of magnitude fewer parameters.

ratio of edges over vertices in the network $RT$ we find properties resembling
graphene/honeycomb lattices, like a similar DOS containing a linear dispersion
relation at the band center at energy E=0. In addition we find PLS at various
energies including E=-1,0,1 and others, for example related to the golden
ratio. At E=0 the PLS lie at disconnected vertices, due to partial bipartite
symmetries of the random networks (0D order). At E=-1,1 the PLS lie mostly at
pairs of vertices(bonds), while the rest of the PLS at other energies, like the
ones related to the golden ratio, lie at lines of vertices of fixed length(1D

confined graphene systems with zig-zag edges. As the ratio $RT$ is increased
the DOS of the network approaches the Wigner semi-circle, corresponding to
random symmetric matrices(Hamiltonians) and the PLS are reduced and gradually
disappear as the connectivity in the network increases. Finally we calculate
the spatial dimension $D$ of the network and its fluctuations, obtaining both

volume loss due to storm Adrian which caused heavy forest damage in the upper

estimated using growing stock volume measured with a terrestrial laser scanner
on 62 sample plots distributed across five sub-regions. Predictor variables
were derived from high resolution vegetation height measurements collected
during an airborne laser scanning campaign. Non-spatial and spatial candidate
models were proposed and assessed based on fit to observed data and
out-of-sample prediction. Spatial Gaussian processes associated model
intercepts and regression coefficients were used to capture spatial dependence.
Results show a spatially-varying coefficient model, which allowed the intercept
and regression coefficients to vary spatially, yielded the best fit and
prediction. Two approaches were considered for prediction over blowdown areas:
1) an areal approach that viewed each blowdown as a single prediction unit
indexed by its centroid; and 2) a block approach where each blowdown was
partitioned into smaller prediction units to better align with sample plots'
spatial support. Joint prediction was used to acknowledge spatial dependence
among block units. Results demonstrated the block approach is preferable as it
mitigated change-of-support issues encountered in the areal approach. Despite
the small sample size, predictions for 55% of the total 564 blowdown areas,
accounting for 93% of the total loss, had a coefficient of variation less than
25%. Key advantages of the proposed regression framework are the ability to
quantify uncertainty in spatial covariance parameters, propagate parameter
uncertainty through to prediction, and provide statistically valid prediction
point and interval estimates for individual blowdowns and collections of
blowdowns.

are vulnerable to a plethora of automated deobfuscation attacks, such as
symbolic execution, taint analysis, or program synthesis. While several
enhanced obfuscation techniques were recently proposed to thwart taint analysis
or symbolic execution, they either impose a prohibitive runtime overhead or can
be removed in an automated way (e.g., via compiler optimizations). In general,
these techniques suffer from focusing on a single attack vector, allowing an
attacker to switch to other, more effective techniques, such as program
synthesis. In this work, we present Loki, an approach for software obfuscation
that is resilient against all known automated deobfuscation attacks. To this
end, we use and efficiently combine multiple techniques, including a generic
approach to synthesize formally verified expressions of arbitrary complexity.
Contrary to state-of-the-art approaches that rely on a few hardcoded generation
rules, our expressions are more diverse and harder to pattern match against.
Even the most recent state-of-the-art research on Mixed-Boolean Arithmetic

previously unaccounted attack vectors such as program synthesis, for which it
reduces the success rate to merely 19%. In a comprehensive evaluation, we show
that our design incurs significantly less overhead while providing a much
stronger protection level compared to existing works.

of the strong interstellar extinction of EUV photons. In this study, we
simulate the XUV (X-ray+EUV) emission from the Sun-like stars by extending the
solar coronal heating model that self-consistently solves, with sufficiently
high resolution, the surface-to-coronal energy transport, turbulent coronal
heating, and coronal thermal response by conduction and radiation. The
simulations are performed with a range of loop lengths and magnetic filling
factors at the stellar surface. With the solar parameters, the model reproduces
the observed solar XUV spectrum below the Lyman edge, thus validating its
capability of predicting the XUV spectra of other Sun-like stars. The model
also reproduces the observed nearly-linear relation between the unsigned
magnetic flux and the X-ray luminosity. From the simulation runs with various
loop lengths and filling factors, we also find a scaling relation, namely $\log
L_{\rm EUV} = 9.93 + 0.67 \log L_{\rm X}$, where $L_{\rm EUV}$ and $L_{\rm X}$
are the luminosity in the EUV and X-ray range, respectively, in cgs. By
assuming a power-law relation between the Rossby number and the magnetic
filling factor, we reproduce the renowned relation between the Rossby number
and the X-ray luminosity. We also propose an analytical description of the
energy injected into the corona, which, in combination with the conventional
Rosner-Tucker-Vaiana scaling law, semi-analytically explains the simulation
results. This study refines the concepts of solar and stellar coronal heating
and derives a theoretical relation for estimating the hidden stellar EUV

explicit construction of operators $J_\ell$ commuting with the Hamiltonian. The
existence of such symmetry has been widely believed to cause the degeneration
of the spectrum, that is, the crossings on the energy curves. In this paper we
propose a conjectural relation between the symmetry and degeneracy for the
ibQRM$_{\ell}$ given explicitly in terms of two polynomials appearing
independently in the respective investigations. Concretely, one of the
polynomials appears as the quotient of the constraint polynomials that assure
the existence of degenerate solutions while the other determines a quadratic
relation (in general, it defines a curve of hyperelliptic type) between the
ibQRM$_{\ell}$ Hamiltonian and its basic commuting operator $J_\ell$. Following
this conjecture, we derive several interesting structural insights of the whole
spectrum. For instance, the energy curves are naturally shown to lie on a
surface determined by the family of hyperelliptic curves by considering the
coupling constant as a variable. This geometric picture contains the
generalization of the parity decomposition of the symmetric quantum Rabi model.
Moreover, it allows us to describe a remarkable approximation of the first
$\ell$ energy curves by the zero-section of the corresponding hyperelliptic
curve. These investigations naturally lead to a geometric picture of the
(hyper-)elliptic surfaces given by the Kodaira-N\'eron type model for a family
of curves over the projective line in connection with the energy curves, which
may be expected to provide a complex analytic proof of the conjecture.

stationarity as well as the shape of the non-Boltzmann stationary PDF. A
typical characteristic is that subdiffusive, antipersistent (with negative
autocorrelation) motion tends to effect an accumulation of probability close to
the origin as compared to the corresponding Boltzmann distribution while the
opposite trend occurs for superdiffusive (persistent) motion. For this latter
case this leads to distinct bimodal shapes of the PDF. This property is
compared to a similar phenomenon observed for Markovian L{\'e}vy flights in

automatic speech recognition (ASR), where a base model is self-trained with
pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. While PL can be further improved
by iteratively updating pseudo-labels as the model evolves, most of the
previous approaches involve inefficient retraining of the model or intricate
control of the label update. We present momentum pseudo-labeling (MPL), a
simple yet effective strategy for semi-supervised ASR. MPL consists of a pair
of online and offline models that interact and learn from each other, inspired
by the mean teacher method. The online model is trained to predict
pseudo-labels generated on the fly by the offline model. The offline model
maintains a momentum-based moving average of the online model. MPL is performed
in a single training process and the interaction between the two models
effectively helps them reinforce each other to improve the ASR performance. We
apply MPL to an end-to-end ASR model based on the connectionist temporal
classification. The experimental results demonstrate that MPL effectively
improves over the base model and is scalable to different semi-supervised
scenarios with varying amounts of data or domain mismatch.

goals of the present and future ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors.
While increasing the detectors' sensitivities will be crucial in achieving
this, efficient data analysis strategies can play a vital role. With given
computational power in hand, efficient data analysis techniques can expand the
size and dimensionality of the parameter space to search for a variety of GW
sources. Matched filtering based analyses that depend on modeled signals to
produce adequate signal-to-noise ratios for signal detection may miss them if
the parameter space is too restrained. Specifically, the CBC search is
currently limited to non-precessing binaries only, where the spins of the
components are either aligned or anti-aligned to the orbital angular momentum.
A hierarchical search for CBCs is thus well motivated. The first stage of this
search is performed by matched filtering coarsely sampled data with a coarse
template bank to look for candidate events. These candidates are then followed
up for a finer search around the vicinity of an event's parameter space.
Performing such a search leads to enormous savings in computational cost. Here
we report the first successful implementation of the hierarchical search as a
PyCBC-based production pipeline to perform a complete analysis of LIGO
observing runs. With this, we analyze Advanced LIGO's first and second
observing run data. We recover all the events detected by the PyCBC (flat)
search in the first GW catalog, GWTC-1, published by the LIGO-Virgo
collaboration, with nearly the same significance using a scaled background. In
the analysis, we get an impressive factor of 20 reduction in computation
compared to the flat search. With a standard injection study, we show that the
sensitivity of the hierarchical search remains comparable to the flat search
within the error bars.

the KL over a restricted class of functions. When using a Reproducing Kernel

inherits from the limiting KL a greater sensitivity to mismatch in the support

  This paper addresses this challenge of detection of memory leaks in
cloud-based infrastructure without having any internal knowledge by introducing
two novel machine learning-based algorithms: Linear Backward Regression (LBR)
and Precog and, their two variants: Linear Backward Regression with Change
Points Detection (LBRCPD) and Precog with Maximum Filteration (PrecogMF). These
algorithms only use one metric i.e the system's memory utilization on which the
application is deployed for detection of a memory leak. The developed
algorithm's accuracy was tested on 60 virtual machines manually labeled memory
utilization data and it was found that the proposed PrecogMF algorithm achieves
the highest accuracy score of 85%. The same algorithm also achieves this by
decreasing the overall compute time by 80% when compared to LBR's compute time.
  The paper also presents the different memory leak patterns found in the
various memory leak applications and are further classified into different

but also in maintaining whole-plant water status through transient
environmental changes in soil-based water supply or air humidity. Both water
potential and hydraulic resistance vary spatially throughout the leaf transport
network, consisting of xylem, stomata and water-storage cells, and portions of
leaf areas far from the leaf base can be disproportionately disadvantaged under
water stress. Besides the suppression of transpiration and reduction of water
loss caused by stomatal closure, the leaf capacitance of water storage, which
can also vary locally, is thought to be crucial for the maintenance of leaf
water status. In order to study the fluid dynamics in these networks, we
develop a spatially explicit, capacitive model which is able to capture the
local spatiotemporal changes of water potential and flow rate. In
electrical-circuit analogues described by Ohm's law, we implement linear
capacitors imitating water storage, and we present both analytical calculations
of a uniform one-dimensional model and numerical simulation methods for general
spatially explicit network models, and their relation to conventional
lumped-element models. Calculation and simulation results are shown for the
uniform model, which mimics key properties of a monocotyledonous grass leaf. We
illustrate water status of a well-watered leaf, and the lowering of water
potential and transpiration rate caused by excised water source or reduced air
humidity. We show that the time scales of these changes under water stress are
hugely affected by leaf capacitance and resistances to capacitors, in addition
to stomatal resistance. Through this modeling of a grass leaf, we confirm the
presence of uneven water distribution over leaf area, and also discuss the
importance of considering the spatial variation of leaf hydraulic traits in
plant biology.

bending stiffness, which is set by the spontaneous curvature of the flexible
hook, the shape of the cell body, and the flagellum geometry, can have a
dramatic effect on the cell's trajectory through the fluid. Although the
equilibrium hook angle can result in a wide variance in the trajectory's
helical pitch, we find a very consistent prediction for the trajectory's
helical amplitude using parameters relevant to swimming P. aeruginosa cells.

irreversibilities, thermal exchange between the in-cylinder mixture and the
cylinder wall, and non-stoichiometric combustion allows for a comprehensive
description of the availability transfer and destruction phenomena in the
engine. The model is applicable to internal combustion engines operating both
in steady-state and over a sequence of operating points and can be used to
characterize the whole engine operating region, allowing to create static maps
describing the exergetic behavior of the engine as a function of speed and
load. The application of the proposed modeling strategy is shown for a
turbocharged diesel engine. Ultimately, the static maps, while providing
insightful information about inefficiencies over the whole operating field of
the engine, are the enabling step for the development of exergy-based control
strategies aiming at minimizing the overall operational losses of ground
vehicles.

outbreak. At the beginning of the epidemic, people do not know about the virus,
then, after the outbreak of epidemics and alarm, they begin to comply with the
restrictions and the spreading of epidemics may decline. Over time, some people
get tired/frustrated by the restrictions and stop following them (exhaustion),
especially if the number of new cases drops down. After resting for a while,
they can follow the restrictions again. But during this pause the second wave
can come and become even stronger then the first one. Studies based on SIR
models do not predict the observed quick exit from the first wave of epidemics.
Social dynamics should be considered. The appearance of the second wave also
depends on social factors. Many generalizations of the SIR model have been
developed that take into account the weakening of immunity over time, the
evolution of the virus, vaccination and other medical and biological details.
However, these more sophisticated models do not explain the apparent
differences in outbreak profiles between countries with different intrinsic
socio-cultural features. In our work, a system of models of the COVID-19
pandemic is proposed, combining the dynamics of social stress with classical
epidemic models. Social stress is described by the tools of sociophysics. The
combination of a dynamic SIR-type model with the classical triad of stages of
the general adaptation syndrome, alarm-resistance-exhaustion, makes it possible
to describe with high accuracy the available statistical data for 13 countries.
The sets of kinetic constants corresponding to optimal fit of model to data
were found. They characterize the ability of society to mobilize efforts
against epidemics and maintain this concentration over time, and can further
help in the development of strategies specific to a particular society.

``what-if'' scenarios, and are an instance of example-based reasoning using a
set of hypothetical data samples. Counterfactuals essentially show how the

counterfactuals are mainly algorithm-based, which are time-inefficient and
assume the same counterfactual universe for different queries. To address these

counterfactual universe for those rare queries, we novelly employ the umbrella
sampling technique to conduct the MCS framework training. Besides, we also
enhance the MCS framework by incorporating the causal dependence among
attributes with model inductive bias, and validate its design correctness from
the causality identification perspective. Experimental results on several
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness as well as efficiency of our proposed
MCS framework, and verify the advantages compared with other alternatives.

both the intensity of an odor and the timing of odor encounters. However,
whether intensity or timing of odor detections is more informative for
olfactory-driven behavior is not understood. To tackle this question, we
consider the problem of locating a target using the odor it releases. We ask
whether the position of a target is best predicted by measures of timing
intensity of its odor, sampled for a short period of time. To answer this
question, we feed data from accurate numerical simulations of odor transport to
machine learning algorithms that learn how to connect odor to target location.
We find that both intensity and timing can separately predict target location
even from a distance of several meters; however their efficacy varies with the
dilution of the odor in space. Thus organisms that use olfaction from different
ranges may have to switch among different modalities. This has implications on
how the brain should represent odors as the target is approached. We
demonstrate simple strategies to improve accuracy and robustness of the
prediction by modifying odor sampling and appropriately combining distinct
measures together. To test the predictions, animal behavior and odor
representation should be monitored as the animal moves relative to the target,
or in virtual conditions that mimic concentrated dilute environments.

(FVS) to analyse the occupation of galaxies in haloes within these high
globally dense regions.
  We use a publicly available simulated galaxy set constructed with a
semi-analytical model to identify FVS in the simulation. Then, we computed the
HOD within these superstructures for different absolute magnitude thresholds
and make several analysis including the comparison to the global HOD results.
We study the dependence on the results on properties of the FVS such as density
and volume as well as consider the morphology of galaxies. We also analysed the
properties of the stellar content of galaxies and the formation time of the
haloes inside FVS.
  We find a significant increase in the HOD inside FVS. This result is present
for all absolute magnitude thresholds explored. The effect is larger in the
densest regions of FVS, but does not depend on the volume of the
superstructure. We also find that the stellar-mass content of galaxies
considerably differs inside the superstructures. Low mass haloes have their
central and satellite galaxies with a higher stellar mass content (50%), and
exhibit mean star ages (20%) older than average. For massive haloes in FVS we
find that only the stellar mass of satellite galaxies varies considerably
corresponding to a decrease of 50%. We find a significant statistical
difference between the formation times of haloes in FVS and the average
population. Haloes residing in superstructures formed earlier, a fact that
leads to several changes in the HOD and their member galaxy properties.

Black box models can make it very difficult to know which covariates are

propose mSHAP (or multiplicative SHAP), a method for computing SHAP values of

will allow for the predictions of two-part models to be explained at an
individual observation level. After developing mSHAP, we perform an in-depth

computing approximate SHAP values for a two-part model, a comparison with our

mSHAP to a two-part ratemaking model for personal auto property damage

ecosystems, changing on the same timescale for interacting species with rapid

problem in mathematical modeling is to connect ecology, evolution and genetics,
which often have been treated separately. Here, extending analysis of multiple
virus and immune response populations in a resource - prey (consumer) -
predator model from Browne and Smith \cite{browne2018dynamics}, we show that
long term dynamics of viral mutants evolving resistance at distinct epitopes
(viral proteins targeted by immune responses) are governed by epistasis in the
virus fitness landscape. In particular, the stability of persistent equilibrium
virus-immune (prey-predator) network structures, such as nested and one-to-one,
and bifurcations are determined by a collection of circuits defined by
combinations of viral fitnesses that are minimally additive within a hypercube
of binary sequences representing all possible viral epitope sequences ordered
according to immunodominance hierarchy. Numerical solutions of our ordinary
differential equation system, along with an extended stochastic version
including random mutation, demonstrate how pairwise or multiplicative epistatic
interactions shape viral evolution against concurrent immune responses and
convergence to the multi-variant steady state predicted by theoretical results.
Furthermore, simulations illustrate how periodic infusions of subdominant
immune responses can induce a bifurcation in the persistent viral strains,
offering superior host outcome over an alternative strategy of immunotherapy
with strongest immune response.

define GNN architectures capable of obtaining a given approximation; (2) show
that the Weisfeiler-Lehman test converges in r+1 steps, where r is the diameter
of the graph; (3) derive a formal relationship between the Weisfeiler-Lehman
test and the unfolding trees, that is trees that can be built by visiting the

a strain field obtained via digital image correlation. This information enables
the determination of material properties, making this approach an alternative
to finite element model updating or the virtual fields method. This article
focuses on developing a finite volume discretization of this system of
equations to address instabilities that arise from violations of the
Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition. The developed discretization enables the
system of equations to be applied to irregular geometries and finite
deformation. We determine how, in general, one may translate knowledge of the
traction at the boundary into boundary conditions, so that the numerical method
can be applied to a variety of loading conditions. We analyse the solution
structure in the case of deformation discontinuities, and the results are
applied to account for discontinuities at the interfaces between finite volumes
(this has relevance to other applications such as composite materials).
Interestingly, the discontinuities cause reflection and transmission of the
principal stresses.
  The finite volume discretization is validated using data output from
commercial finite element software. Furthermore, the discretization is applied
to an experimental uniaxial tension test with plastic deformation and necking.
The strain field is obtained using digital image correlation, and the stress
field is computed using the developed finite volume discretization. Together,
these give the stress-strain behavior for each material element.

significant impact on the way we behave and interact in our daily life. The
past year has witnessed a strong interplay between human behaviors and epidemic
spreading. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game-theoretic framework
to study the coupled evolutions of herd behaviors and epidemics. Our framework
extends the classical degree-based mean-field epidemic model over complex
networks by coupling it with the evolutionary game dynamics. The statistically
equivalent individuals in a population choose their social activity intensities
based on the fitness or the payoffs that depend on the state of the epidemics.
Meanwhile, the spreading of the infectious disease over the complex network is
reciprocally influenced by the players' social activities. We analyze the
coupled dynamics by studying the stationary properties of the epidemic for a
given herd behavior and the structural properties of the game for a given
epidemic process. The decisions of the herd turn out to be strategic
substitutes. We formulate an equivalent finite-player game and an equivalent
network to represent the interactions among the finite populations. We develop
structure-preserving approximation techniques to study time-dependent
properties of the joint evolution of the behavioral and epidemic dynamics. The
resemblance between the simulated coupled dynamics and the real COVID-19
statistics in the numerical experiments indicates the predictive power of our
framework.

uniquely probe the $z\gtrsim 1$ (resp., pre-reionization) Universe. However,
LIM foregrounds are a key hurdle to this futuristic technique. While continuum
foregrounds can be controlled by discarding modes perpendicular to the line of
sight (low $k_\parallel$ modes), interloper foregrounds haven't been addressed
in the context of LIM lensing. In this paper, we quantify the interloper bias
to LIM lensing for the first time, and derive a ''LIM-pair'' estimator which
avoids it exactly after cross-correlating with CMB lensing. This new quadratic
lensing estimator works by combining two intensity maps in different lines,
from the same redshift, whose interlopers are uncorrelated. As a result, this
foreground avoidance method is robust to even large changes in the amplitude of
the interloper power and non-Gaussianity. The cross-spectrum of the LIM-pair

the subtle difference between MTL and meta-learning in the problem formulation,
both learning paradigms share the same insight that the shared structure

close connection between these two learning paradigms, through both theoretical

MTL shares the same optimization formulation with a class of gradient-based

given by these two models are similar over the same unseen task. Empirically,
we corroborate our theoretical findings by showing that, with proper

algorithms often involve costly second-order bi-level optimization, our
first-order MTL method is an order of magnitude faster on large-scale datasets

process in which many different realizations may achieve the goal. This
many-to-one map presents challenges to the supervised learning of feed-forward
synthesis, as the set of viable designs may have a complex structure. In
addition, the non-differentiable nature of many physical simulations prevents
efficient direct optimization. We address both of these problems with a
two-stage neural network architecture that we may consider to be an

approximates the many-to-one physical realization process. We then learn the
encoder, which maps from goal to design, while using the fixed decoder to
evaluate the quality of the realization. We evaluate the approach on two case
studies: extruder path planning in additive manufacturing and constrained soft

performances of the trained device gets much closer to those obtained via
conventional algorithms, these latter requiring however a considerably heavier

11 at redshifts z=0.3, 0.7, 1 and 2 we find that extended MgII halos in
emission, similar to their Lyman-alpha counterparts, are ubiquitous across the
galaxy population. Median surface brightness profiles exceed 10^-19
erg/s/cm^2/arcsec^2 in the central ~10s of kpc, and total halo MgII luminosity
increases with mass for star-forming galaxies, reaching 10^40 erg/s for M* ~

masses, and sizes are larger for halos in denser environments. MgII halos are
highly structured, clumpy, and asymmetric, with isophotal axis ratio increasing
with galaxy mass. Similarly, the amount and distribution of MgII emission
depends on the star formation activity of the central galaxy. Kinematically,
inflowing versus outflowing gas dominates the MgII luminosity at high and low
galaxy masses, respectively, although the majority of MgII halo emission at
z~0.7 traces near-equilibrium fountain flows and gas with non-negligible
rotational support, rather than rapidly outflowing galactic winds.

stand as a central technique for scalable learning algorithms based on kernel
methods, and more recently proposed optimized random features, sampled
depending on the model and the data distribution, can significantly reduce and
provably minimize the required number of features. However, existing research
on classification using optimized RFs has suffered from computational hardness
in sampling each optimized RF; moreover, it has failed to achieve the
exponentially fast error-convergence speed that other state-of-the-art kernel
methods can achieve under a low-noise condition. To overcome these slowdowns,
we here construct a classification algorithm with optimized RFs accelerated by
means of quantum machine learning (QML) and study its runtime to clarify
overall advantage. We prove that our algorithm can achieve the exponential

same time, our algorithm can exploit the advantage of the significant reduction
of the number of features without the computational hardness owing to QML.
These results discover a promising application of QML to acceleration of the

theories based on energy-penalty schemes has recently stimulated impressive
efforts both theoretically and in setups of quantum synthetic matter. A major
challenge is the reliability of such schemes in non-Abelian gauge theories
where local conservation laws do not commute. Here, we show through exact
diagonalization that non-Abelian gauge invariance can be reliably controlled
using gauge-protection terms that energetically stabilize the target gauge
sector in Hilbert space, suppressing gauge violations due to unitary
gauge-breaking errors. We present analytic arguments that predict a
volume-independent protection strength $V$, which when sufficiently large leads
to the emergence of an \textit{adjusted} gauge theory with the same local gauge
symmetry up to least a timescale $\propto\sqrt{V/V_0^3}$. Thereafter, a
\textit{renormalized} gauge theory dominates up to a timescale
$\propto\exp(V/V_0)/V_0$ with $V_0$ a volume-independent energy factor, similar
to the case of faulty Abelian gauge theories. Moreover, we show for certain
experimentally relevant errors that single-body protection terms robustly
suppress gauge violations up to all accessible evolution times in exact
diagonalization, and demonstrate that the adjusted gauge theory emerges in this
case as well. These single-body protection terms can be readily implemented
with fewer engineering requirements than the ideal gauge theory itself in
current ultracold-atom setups and NISQ devices.

distinguish an MBL phase from an ergodic one, can be represented in terms of
eigenstate amplitudes on the Fock space. Motivated by this, we introduce and
study spatial correlations on the Fock space. From these, a correlation length
emerges, which is found to vary discontinuously across the MBL transition; and
is intimately connected to the discontinuous jump in the multifractal exponents
characterising the Fock-space wavefunctions. Exploiting the direct connection

the inverse participation ratio. It yields a volume-scale in the ergodic phase

studying two complementary scenarios, we explicitly show that the framework can

distinguishing between dynamical and isolated formation scenarios of binary

impact the detectable distribution of eccentric mergers from clusters. We show
that the observation (or lack thereof) of eccentric binary black hole mergers
can significantly constrain the fraction of detectable systems that originate
from dynamical environments, such as dense star clusters. After roughly 150
observations, observing no eccentric binary signals would indicate that
clusters cannot make up the majority of the merging binary black hole
population in the local universe (95% credibility). However, if dense star
clusters dominate the rate of eccentric mergers and a single system is
confirmed to be measurably eccentric in the first and second gravitational-wave
transient catalogs, clusters must account for at least 14% of detectable binary
black hole mergers. The constraints on the fraction of detectable systems from
dense star clusters become significantly tighter as the number of eccentric
observations grows and will be constrained to within 0.5 dex once 10 eccentric
binary black holes are observed.

To prove the failure of classicality in the sense of Kochen-Specker
noncontextuality, one does indeed require sets of incompatible measurements.
However, a more broadly applicable and more permissive notion of classicality
is the existence of a generalized-noncontextual ontological model. In
particular, this notion can imply constraints on the representation of outcomes

satellite galaxies and the predicted number of cold dark matter (CDM) subhalos
was dubbed the ``missing satellites problem"". Although mostly framed since in
terms of satellite counts in luminosity space, the missing satellites problem
was originally posed in velocity space. Importantly, the stellar velocity
dispersion function encodes information about the density profile of satellites
as well as their abundance. In this work, we completeness correct the MW
satellite stellar velocity dispersion function down to its ultrafaint dwarfs
($L \gtrsim 340$ L$_\odot$). Our most conservative completeness correction is
in good agreement with a simple CDM model in which massive, classical
satellites (M$_{\rm 200} \gtrsim 5 \times 10^8~$M$_\odot$) have baryon-driven
cores, while lower mass, ultrafaint satellites inhabit cuspy halos that are not
strongly tidally stripped. Tidal destruction of satellites by the MW's disk
must be minimal, otherwise the completeness-corrected velocity function exceeds
any plausible CDM prediction -- a ``too many satellites"" problem. We rule out
non-core-collapsing self-interacting dark matter models with a constant cross
section $\gtrsim$ 0.1 cm$^2$/g. Constraints on warm dark matter are stronger
than those based on the luminosity function due to its additional sensitivity
to subhalo central densities, which suppresses number counts by up to an
additional 30%. A thermal relic mass $\gtrsim$ 6 keV is preferred. Reducing
uncertainties on stellar velocity dispersion measurements and the amount of
tidal stripping experienced by the faintest dwarfs is key to determining the
severity of the too many satellites problem.

observations for the earliest epochs. The synthetic spectra are calculated with
the one dimensional MC radiative-transfer code TARDIS from self-consistent

the outer layers of the ejecta, if confirmed, implies strong constraints on the
possible explosion scenarios. We investigate the impact of the inferred

code TURTLS, and confront the results with the observed light curves of

discharges in a pin-to-pin electrode configuration at atmospheric conditions
operating in single-pulse mode (no memory effects). Various discharge
parameters, including voltage, current, gas density, rotational/vibrational/gas
temperature, and electron number density, were measured. Several different
measurement techniques were used, including microwave Rayleigh scattering,
laser Rayleigh scattering, optical emission spectroscopy enhanced with a
nanosecond probing pulse, fast photography, and electrical parameter
measurements. Spark and corona discharge regimes were studied with discharge
pulse duration of 90 ns and electrode gap sizes ranging from 2 to 10 mm. The
spark regime was observed for gaps < 6 mm using discharge pulse energies of
0.6-1 mJ per mm of the gap length. Higher electron number densities, total
electron number per gap length, discharge currents, and gas temperatures were
observed for smaller electrode gaps and larger pulse energies, reaching maximal
values of about 7.5x10^15 cm-3, 3.5x10^11 electrons per mm, 22 A, and 4,000 K
(at 10 us after the discharge), respectively, for a 2 mm gap and 1 mJ/mm
discharge pulse energy. Initial breakdown was followed by a secondary breakdown
occurring about 30-70 ns later and was associated with ignition of a cathode
spot and transition of the discharge to cathodic arc. A majority of the
discharge pulse energy was deposited into the gas before the secondary
breakdown (85-89%). The electron number density after the ns discharge pulse
decayed with a characteristic time scale of 150 ns governed by dissociative
recombination and electron attachment to oxygen mechanisms. For the corona
regime, substantially lower pulse energies (~0.1 mJ/mm), peak conduction
current (1-2 A), and electron numbers (3-5x10^10 electrons per mm), and gas
temperatures (360 K) were observed.

reside in the probability simplex, and are transformed by an unknown
post-nonlinear mixing system. This problem finds various applications in signal
and data analytics, e.g., nonlinear hyperspectral unmixing, image embedding,
and nonlinear clustering. Linear mixture learning problems are already
ill-posed, as identifiability of the target latent components is hard to
establish in general. With unknown nonlinearity involved, the problem is even
more challenging. Prior work offered a function equation-based formulation for
provable latent component identification. However, the identifiability
conditions are somewhat stringent and unrealistic. In addition, the
identifiability analysis is based on the infinite sample (i.e., population)
case, while the understanding for practical finite sample cases has been
elusive. Moreover, the algorithm in the prior work trades model expressiveness
with computational convenience, which often hinders the learning performance.
Our contribution is threefold. First, new identifiability conditions are
derived under largely relaxed assumptions. Second, comprehensive sample
complexity results are presented -- which are the first of the kind. Third, a
constrained autoencoder-based algorithmic framework is proposed for
implementation, which effectively circumvents the challenges in the existing
algorithm. Synthetic and real experiments corroborate our theoretical analyses.

on Convolution Long Short Term Memory (ConvLSTM) that makes use of series of
deformation vector fields (DVF) between individual timepoints and reference

changes in gross tumor volume as well as critical OARs. High-quality DVF
training data is created by employing hyper-parameter optimization on the

reconnections in the vicinity of the horizon. For the most symmetric scenario
(aligned cases), these reconnection events can release large-scale plasmoids

misaligned cases, a larger fraction of the luminosity is instead carried

evolution. Jupiter has been the most well-studied giant planet in terms of its
atmosphere; however, the origin of the Jovian atmospheric composition remains a
puzzle as the abundances of nitrogen and noble gases as high as those of other
elements could only originate from extremely cold environments. We propose a
novel idea for explaining the Jovian atmospheric composition: Dust pileup at
the H$_2$O snow line casts a shadow and cools the Jupiter orbit so that N$_2$
and noble gases can freeze. Planetesimals or a core formed in the shadowed
region can enrich nitrogen and noble gases as much as other elements through
their dissolution in the envelope. We compute the temperature structure of a
shadowed protosolar disk with radiative transfer calculations. Then, we
investigate the radial volatile distributions and predict the atmospheric
composition of Jupiter with condensation calculations. We find that the
vicinity of the current Jupiter orbit, approximately $3$--$7~{\rm AU}$, could
be as cold as $30~{\rm K}$ if the small-dust surface density varies by a factor
of $\gtrsim30$ across the H$_2$O snow line. According to previous grain growth
simulations, this condition could be achieved by weak disk turbulence if
silicate grains are more fragile than icy grains. The shadow can cause the
condensation of most volatile substances, namely N$_2$ and Ar. We demonstrate
that the dissolution of shadowed solids can explain the elemental abundance
patterns of the Jovian atmosphere even if proto-Jupiter was formed near
Jupiter's current orbit. The disk shadow may play a vital role in controlling
atmospheric compositions. The effect of the shadow also impacts the
interpretation of upcoming observations of exoplanetary atmospheres by JWST.

and the sample galaxies have spectroscopic redshift or low-uncertainty
photometric redshifts ($\sigma_z < 0.02$) in nine galaxy clusters. Source
properties of the target galaxies are either extracted from the literature or
computed using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. Both
weighted-average and median stacking are used, on both the full sample and

exponentially with level energy and could be extrapolated up to higher

two qubits and solves the neighbourhood constraint of qubit topology. Though,
one needs to decompose the SWAP gate into three CNOT gates to implement SWAP
gate efficiently, but unwillingly quantum cost with respect to gate count and
depth increases. In this paper, a new formalism of moving quantum states
without using SWAP operation is introduced for the first time to the best of
our knowledge. Moving quantum states through qubits have been attained with the
adoption of temporary intermediate qudit states. This introduction of
intermediate qudit states has exhibited a three times reduction in quantum cost
with respect to gate count and approximately two times reduction in respect to
circuit depth compared to the state-of-the-art approach of SWAP gate insertion.
Further, the proposed approach is generalized to any dimensional quantum

deposition for each pencil beam at its endpoint (Bragg peak), and low entrance

verification methods are required; these methods ensure that the Bragg peak is
positioned correctly in the patient and the dose is delivered as prescribed.
Relative range verification allows intra-fraction monitoring of Bragg peak
spacing to ensure full coverage with each fraction, as well as inter-fraction
monitoring to ensure all fractions are delivered consistently. To validate the
proposed filtered Interaction Vertex Imaging method for relative range
verification, a ${}^{16}$O beam was used to deliver 12 Bragg peak positions in
a 40 mm poly-(methyl methacrylate) phantom. Secondary particles produced in the
phantom were monitored using position-sensitive silicon detectors. Events
recorded on these detectors, along with a measurement of the treatment beam
axis, were used to reconstruct the sites of origin of these secondary particles
in the phantom. The distal edge of the depth distribution of these
reconstructed points was determined with logistic fits, and the translation in
depth required to minimize the $\chi^2$ statistic between these fits was used
to compute the range shift between any two Bragg peak positions. In all cases,
the range shift was determined with sub-millimeter precision, to a standard
deviation of the mean of 220(10) $\mu$m. This result validates filtered
Interaction Vertex Imaging as a reliable relative range verification method,

charge, and after 1000 charge/discharge cycles. Electrode modulus and strength
increase with increasing CNT volume fraction; in contrast, the capacitance
increases with increasing PANI mass. Charging or cycling reduce the electrode
modulus and strength due to a decrease in CNT bundle volume fraction caused by
swelling; the electrode capacitance also decreases due to a reduction in PANI
mass. A micromechanical model is able to predict the stress-strain response of
pre-charged and cycled electrodes, based upon their measured composition after
pre-charging and cycling. The electrodes possess up to 63% of their theoretical
capacitance, and their tensile strengths are comparable to those of engineering
alloys. Their capacitance and strength decrease by less than 15% after the
application of 1000 charge/discharge cycles. These properties illustrate their
potential as structural energy storage devices.

study because: i) they suffer from the severe crowding and galactic extinction;
which are characteristic of these inner Galactic regions ii) they are more
prone to be affected by dynamical processes. Therefore, they are relatively
faint and difficult to map. However, deep near-infrared photometry like that
provided by the VISTA Variables in the Via L\'actea Extended Survey (VVVX) is
allowing us to map GCs in this crucial yet relatively uncharted region.
  Our results confirm with high confidence that both FSR 19 and FSR 25 are
genuine MW bulge GCs. Each of the performed tests and resulting parameters
provides clear evidence for the GC nature of these targets. We derive distances
of 7.2$\pm$0.7 kpc and D=7.0$\pm$0.6 (corresponding to distance moduli of
14.29$\pm$0.08 and
  14.23$\pm$0.07) for FSR 19 and FSR 25, respectively. Their ages and
metallicities are 11 Gyr and [Fe/H]= -0.5 dex for both clusters, which were
determined from Dartmouth and PARSEC isochrone fitting. The integrated
luminosities are M$_{Ks}$(FSR 19) = -7.72 mag and M$_{Ks}$(FSR 25) = -7.31 mag
which places them in the faint tail of the GC Luminosity Function. By adopting
a King profile for their number distribution, we determine their core and tidal
radii ($r_c$, $r_t$). For FSR 19, r$_{c}$= 2.76$\pm$0.36 pc and
r$_{t}$=5.31$\pm$0.49 pc, while FSR 25 appears more extended with r$_{c}$=

$\mu_{\delta}$= -5.02 $\pm$0.47 mas $yr^{-1}$ and $\mu_{\alpha^\ast}$= -2.61

inference on neuromorphic systems, impacting the Quality-of-Service (QoS).
Elevated temperatures and frequent usage can significantly shorten the number
of times an RRAM cell can be reliably read before it becomes absolutely
necessary to reprogram. We propose an architectural solution to extend the read
endurance of RRAM-based neuromorphic systems. We make two key contributions.
First, we formulate the read endurance of an RRAM cell as a function of the
programmed synaptic weight and its activation within a machine learning
workload. Second, we propose an intelligent workload mapping strategy
incorporating the endurance formulation to place the synapses of a machine
learning model onto the RRAM cells of the hardware. The objective is to extend
the inference lifetime, defined as the number of times the model can be used to
generate output (inference) before the trained weights need to be reprogrammed
on the RRAM cells of the system. We evaluate our architectural solution with
machine learning workloads on a cycle-accurate simulator of an RRAM-based
neuromorphic system. Our results demonstrate a significant increase in

our experiments, we show that SAILR violates constraints far less during
training than standard safe RL and constrained MDP approaches and converges to
a well-performing policy that can be deployed safely without intervention. Our

theoretically and experimentally investigate how an off-resonant drive on the
transmon ancilla modifies the nonlinearities of cavity modes in qualitatively
different ways, depending on the interrelation among cavity-transmon detuning,
drive-transmon detuning and transmon anharmonicity. For a cavity-transmon
detuning that is smaller than or comparable to the drive-transmon detuning and
transmon anharmonicity, the off-resonant transmon drive can induce multiphoton
resonances among cavity and transmon excitations that strongly modify cavity
nonlinearities as drive parameters vary. For a large cavity-transmon detuning,
the drive induces cavity-photon-number-dependent ac Stark shifts of transmon
levels that translate into effective cavity nonlinearities. In the regime of
weak transmon-cavity coupling, the cavity Kerr nonlinearity relates to the
third-order nonlinear susceptibility function $\chi^{(3)}$ of the driven
ancilla. This susceptibility function provides a numerically efficient way of
computing the cavity Kerr particularly for systems with many cavity modes
controlled by a single transmon. It also serves as a diagnostic tool for
identifying undesired drive-induced multiphoton resonance processes. Lastly, we
show that by judiciously choosing the drive amplitude, a single off-resonant
transmon drive can be used to cancel the cavity self-Kerr nonlinearity or the
inter-cavity cross-Kerr. This provides a way of dynamically correcting the
cavity Kerr nonlinearity during bosonic operations or quantum error correction
protocols that rely on the cavity modes being linear.

heuristic, and the orthogonality of convolutional layers is not systematically
studied: some of these designs are not exactly orthogonal, while others only
consider standard convolutional layers and propose specific classes of their
realizations. To address this problem, we propose a theoretical framework for
orthogonal convolutional layers, which establishes the equivalence between
various orthogonal convolutional layers in the spatial domain and the
paraunitary systems in the spectral domain. Since there exists a complete
spectral factorization of paraunitary systems, any orthogonal convolution layer
can be parameterized as convolutions of spatial filters. Our framework endows
high expressive power to various convolutional layers while maintaining their
exact orthogonality. Furthermore, our layers are memory and computationally
efficient for deep networks compared to previous designs. Our versatile
framework, for the first time, enables the study of architecture designs for
deep orthogonal networks, such as choices of skip connection, initialization,
stride, and dilation. Consequently, we scale up orthogonal networks to deep
architectures, including ResNet, WideResNet, and ShuffleNet, substantially
increasing the performance over the traditional shallow orthogonal networks.

scene is important across optics and is particularly important for predicting
the science yield of astronomical telescopes. As a consequence of their goal of
suppressing starlight, coronagraphic instruments for high-contrast imaging have
particularly complex field-dependent point-spread-functions (PSFs). The Roman
Coronagraph Instrument (CGI), Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC) is one example. The
purpose of the HLC is to image exoplanets and exozodiacal dust in order to
understand dynamics of solar systems. This paper details how images of
exoplanets and exozodiacal dust are simulated using some of the most recent
PSFs generated for the CGI HLC imaging mode. First, PSFs are generated using
physical optics propagation techniques. Then, the angular offset of pixels in
image scenes, such as exozodiacal dust models, are used to create a library of
interpolated PSFs using interpolation and rotation techniques, such that the
interpolated PSFs correspond to angular offsets of the pixels. This means
interpolation needs only be done once and an image can then be simulated by
multiplying the vector array of the model astrophysical scene by the matrix
array of the interpolated PSF data. This substantially reduces the time
required to generate image simulations by reducing the process to matrix
multiplication, allowing for faster scene analysis. We will detail the steps
required to generate coronagraphic scenes, quantify the speed-up of our matrix
approach versus other implementations, and provide example code for users who
wish to simulate their own scenes using publicly available HLC PSFs.

presents second-order conic (SOC) and polyhedral approximation schemes for the

generalize existing SOC approximation approaches in the extended space, propose
new scaling and shifting methods, prove approximation accuracies, and derive
lower bounds of approximations. We then study the polyhedral outer

key mission objectives. The trajectory generation problem is almost always
nonconvex, which typically means that it is not readily amenable to efficient

nonetheless solve nonconvex trajectory generation tasks through the use of a
convex optimizer. The theoretical guarantees and computational speed offered by
convex optimization have made the algorithms popular in both research and
industry circles. To date, the list of applications includes rocket landing,
spacecraft hypersonic reentry, spacecraft rendezvous and docking, aerial motion
planning for fixed-wing and quadrotor vehicles, robot motion planning, and

(1) compact, (2) accurate, and (3) robust to distributional shifts.
Unfortunately, efforts towards simultaneously meeting these requirements have
mostly been unsuccessful. This raises an important question: Is the inability
to create Compact, Accurate, and Robust Deep neural networks (CARDs)
fundamental? To answer this question, we perform a large-scale analysis of
popular model compression techniques which uncovers several intriguing
patterns. Notably, in contrast to traditional pruning approaches (e.g., fine
tuning and gradual magnitude pruning), we find that ""lottery ticket-style""
approaches can surprisingly be used to produce CARDs, including binary-weight
CARDs. Specifically, we are able to create extremely compact CARDs that,
compared to their larger counterparts, have similar test accuracy and matching
(or better) robustness -- simply by pruning and (optionally) quantizing.
Leveraging the compactness of CARDs, we develop a simple domain-adaptive
test-time ensembling approach (CARD-Decks) that uses a gating module to
dynamically select appropriate CARDs from the CARD-Deck based on their
spectral-similarity with test samples. The proposed approach builds a ""winning

conversation between humans. As humans begin to interact with non-human
dialogue systems more frequently and in a broader scope, an important question
emerges: what principles govern those interactions? The present study addresses
this question by evaluating human-AI interactions using Grice's four maxims; we
demonstrate that humans do, indeed, apply these maxims to interactions with AI,
even making explicit references to the AI's performance through a Gricean lens.
Twenty-three participants interacted with an American English-speaking Alexa
and rated and discussed their experience with an in-lab researcher. Researchers
then reviewed each exchange, identifying those that might relate to Grice's
maxims: Quantity, Quality, Manner, and Relevance. Many instances of explicit
user frustration stemmed from violations of Grice's maxims. Quantity violations
were noted for too little but not too much information, while Quality
violations were rare, indicating trust in Alexa's responses. Manner violations
focused on speed and humanness. Relevance violations were the most frequent,
and they appear to be the most frustrating. While the maxims help describe many
of the issues participants encountered, other issues do not fit neatly into
Grice's framework. Participants were particularly averse to Alexa initiating
exchanges or making unsolicited suggestions. To address this gap, we propose
the addition of human Priority to describe human-AI interaction. Humans and AIs
are not conversational equals, and human initiative takes priority. We suggest
that the application of Grice's Cooperative Principles to human-AI interactions
is beneficial both from an AI development perspective and as a tool for
describing an emerging form of interaction.

(ReRAM) as an emerging technology to perform inherently parallel analog domain
in-situ matrix-vector multiplication -- the intensive and key computation in
DNNs. With weights stored in the ReRAM crossbar cells as conductance, when the
input vector is applied to word lines, the matrix-vector multiplication results
can be generated as the current in bit lines. A key problem is that the weight
can be either positive or negative, but the in-situ computation assumes all
cells on each crossbar column with the same sign. The current architectures
either use two ReRAM crossbars for positive and negative weights, or add an
offset to weights so that all values become positive. Neither solution is
ideal: they either double the cost of crossbars, or incur extra offset
circuity. To better solve this problem, this paper proposes FORMS, a
fine-grained ReRAM-based DNN accelerator with polarized weights. Instead of
trying to represent the positive/negative weights, our key design principle is
to enforce exactly what is assumed in the in-situ computation -- ensuring that
all weights in the same column of a crossbar have the same sign. It naturally
avoids the cost of an additional crossbar. Such weights can be nicely generated
using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) regularized
optimization, which can exactly enforce certain patterns in DNN weights. To
achieve high accuracy, we propose to use fine-grained sub-array columns, which
provide a unique opportunity for input zero-skipping, significantly avoiding
unnecessary computations. It also makes the hardware much easier to implement.
Putting all together, with the same optimized models, FORMS achieves
significant throughput improvement and speed up in frame per second over ISAAC
with similar area cost.

Existing models either learn from human solutions or use hand-engineered

instead consider symbolic domains as simple environments where states and
actions are given as unstructured text, and binary rewards indicate whether a
problem is solved. This flexible setup makes it easy to specify new domains,

inspired by the Mathematics Common Core Curriculum, and observe that existing
Reinforcement Learning baselines perform poorly. We then present a novel
learning algorithm, Contrastive Policy Learning (ConPoLe) that explicitly
optimizes the InfoNCE loss, which lower bounds the mutual information between
the current state and next states that continue on a path to the solution.
ConPoLe successfully solves all four domains. Moreover, problem representations
learned by ConPoLe enable accurate prediction of the categories of problems in
a real mathematics curriculum. Our results suggest new directions for
reinforcement learning in symbolic domains, as well as applications to

proved powerful in learning image-level representations from unlabeled data.
The learned encoder can then be transferred or fine-tuned to improve the
performance of downstream tasks with limited labels. A critical step in
contrastive learning is the generation of contrastive data pairs, which is
relatively simple for natural image classification but quite challenging for
medical image segmentation due to the existence of the same tissue or organ
across the dataset. As a result, when applied to medical image segmentation,
most state-of-the-art contrastive learning frameworks inevitably introduce a

appliance-specific constraints characterizing the signature of different types

reinforcement learning (RL) approach that combines the ideas of imitation
learning and curriculum learning in order to solve challenging robotic
manipulation tasks with sparse reward functions. Curriculum learning solves
complicated RL tasks by introducing a sequence of auxiliary tasks with
increasing difficulty, yet how to automatically design effective and
generalizable curricula remains a challenging research problem. ACED extracts
curricula from a small amount of expert demonstration trajectories by dividing
demonstrations into sections and initializing training episodes to states
sampled from different sections of demonstrations. Through moving the reset
states from the end to the beginning of demonstrations as the learning agent
improves its performance, ACED not only learns challenging manipulation tasks
with unseen initializations and goals, but also discovers novel solutions that
are distinct from the demonstrations. In addition, ACED can be naturally
combined with other imitation learning methods to utilize expert demonstrations
in a more efficient manner, and we show that a combination of ACED with
behavior cloning allows pick-and-place tasks to be learned with as few as 1
demonstration and block stacking tasks to be learned with 20 demonstrations.

Navier-Stokes equations in highly oscillating bumpy John domains. These domains
are very rough, possibly with fractals or cusps, at the microscopic scale, but
are amenable to the mathematical analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations. We
prove: (i) a large-scale Calder\'on-Zygmund estimate, (ii) a large-scale
Lipschitz estimate, (iii) large-scale higher-order regularity estimates,
namely, $C^{1,\gamma}$ and $C^{2,\gamma}$ estimates. These nice regularity
results are inherited only at mesoscopic scales, and clearly fail in general at
the microscopic scales. We emphasize that the large-scale $C^{1,\gamma}$
regularity is obtained by using first-order boundary layers constructed via a
new argument. The large-scale $C^{2,\gamma}$ regularity relies on the
construction of second-order boundary layers, which allows for certain boundary
data with linear growth at spatial infinity. To the best of our knowledge, our
work is the first to carry out such an analysis. In the wake of many works in
quantitative homogenization, our results strongly advocate in favor of
considering the boundary regularity of the solutions to fluid equations as a
multiscale problem, with improved regularity at or above a certain scale.

physical optics propagation to optimize high-contrast imaging instruments

alternative method of physical optics propagation that decomposes an arbitrary
wavefront into paraxial rays. These rays can be propagated expeditiously using
ABCD matrices, and converted into their corresponding Gaussian beamlets to
accurately model physical optics phenomena without the need of diffraction
integrals. The GBD technique has seen recent development and implementation in
commercial software (e.g. FRED, CODE V, ASAP) but appears to lack an
open-source platform. We present a new GBD tool developed in Python to model
physical optics phenomena, with the goal of alleviating the computational

the capacity to model misalignment errors. This study demonstrates the synergy
of the geometrical and physical regimes of optics utilized by the GBD

differential mapping scheme is proposed to improve the fault tolerance under a
high stuck-on fault rate. Our method can tolerate almost an order of magnitude

advanced by the analytical solutions of Theodorsen, von K\'{a}rm\'{a}n, Wu and
others. While these classical solutions apply only to isolated swimmers, the
flow interactions between multiple swimmers are relevant to many practical
applications, including the schooling and flocking of animal collectives. In
this work, we derive a class of solutions that describe the hydrodynamic
interactions between an arbitrary number of swimmers in a two-dimensional
inviscid fluid. Our approach is rooted in multiply-connected complex analysis
and exploits several recent results. Specifically, the transcendental
(Schottky-Klein) prime function serves as the basic building block to construct
the appropriate conformal maps and leading-edge-suction functions, which allows
us to solve the modified Schwarz problem that arises. As such, our solutions
generalize classical thin aerofoil theory, specifically Wu's waving-plate
analysis, to the case of multiple swimmers. For the case of a pair of
interacting swimmers, we develop an efficient numerical implementation that
allows rapid computations of the forces on each swimmer. We investigate
flow-mediated equilibria and find excellent agreement between our new solutions
and previously reported experimental results. Our solutions recover and unify
disparate results in the literature, thereby opening the door for future
studies into the interactions between multiple swimmers.

temporally resolved wall data is performed using adjoint-variational data
assimilation. The accuracy of the predicted flow deteriorates with distance
from the wall, most precipitously across the buffer layer beyond which only
large-scale structures are reconstructed. To quantify the difficulty of the
state estimation, the Hessian of the associated cost function is evaluated at
the true solution. The forward-adjoint duality is exploited to efficiently
compute the Hessian matrix from the ensemble-averaged cross-correlation of the
adjoint fields due to impulses at the sensing locations and times.
Characteristics of the Hessian are examined when observations correspond to the
streamwise or spanwise wall shear stress or wall pressure. Most of the
eigenmodes decay beyond the buffer layer, thus demonstrating weak sensitivity
of wall observations to the turbulence in the bulk. However, when the
measurement time $t_m^+ \gtrsim 20$, some streamwise-elongated Hessian
eigenfunctions remain finite in the outer flow, which corresponds to the
sensitivity of wall observations to outer large-scale motions. Furthermore, we
report statistics of the adjoint-field kinetic-energy budget at long times,
which are distinctly different from those of the forward model. One notable
difference is the high concentration of energy within the buffer layer and its
narrower support. A large and exponentially amplifying adjoint field in that
region leads to large gradients of the cost function, smaller step size in the
gradient-based optimization, and difficulty to achieve convergence especially
elsewhere in the domain where the gradients are comparatively small.

  With the goal of applying rigorous KAM theory, we compute such quasi-periodic

map to a surface of section (using a high order Taylor's method with extended

method is based on a rapidly convergent Newton's method which is guaranteed to
converge if the initial error is small enough. So, it is very suitable for a

  The resulting algorithm is quite efficient. We only need to deal with a one

deployed onboard commercial fishing vessels to collect essential data for
fisheries management and regulation. These systems generate large quantities of
video data which must be reviewed on land by human experts. Computer vision can
assist this process by automatically detecting and classifying fish species,
however the lack of existing public data in this domain has hindered progress.
To address this, we present the Fishnet Open Images Database, a large dataset
of EM imagery for fish detection and fine-grained categorization onboard
commercial fishing vessels. The dataset consists of 86,029 images containing 34
object classes, making it the largest and most diverse public dataset of
fisheries EM imagery to-date. It includes many of the characteristic challenges
of EM data: visual similarity between species, skewed class distributions,
harsh weather conditions, and chaotic crew activity. We evaluate the
performance of existing detection and classification algorithms and demonstrate
that the dataset can serve as a challenging benchmark for development of
computer vision algorithms in fisheries. The dataset is available at

machine learning models, hyperparameter tuning is becoming increasingly
expensive. However, after assessing 40 tuning methods systematically, we find
that each faces certain limitations. In particular, methods that speed up
tuning via knowledge transfer typically require the final performance of
hyperparameters and do not focus on low-fidelity information. As we demonstrate
empirically, this common practice is suboptimal and can incur an unnecessary
use of resources. It is more cost-efficient to instead leverage low-fidelity
tuning observations to measure inter-task similarity and transfer knowledge
from existing to new tasks accordingly. However, performing multi-fidelity
tuning comes with its own challenges in the transfer setting: the noise in
additional observations and the need for performance forecasting. Therefore, we
propose and conduct a thorough analysis of a multi-task multi-fidelity Bayesian
optimization framework, which leads to the best instantiation--amortized
auto-tuning (AT2). We further present an offline-computed 27-task
hyperparameter recommendation (HyperRec) database to serve the community.
Extensive experiments on HyperRec and other real-world databases illustrate the
effectiveness of our AT2 method.

are a set of differential equations that defines how the coupling constants of
a theory depend on an energy scale. These equations closely resemble
thermodynamical equations and how thermodynamical systems are related to
temperature. In this sense, it is natural to look for structures in the flows
that show a thermodynamics-like behaviour. The mathematical theory to study
these equations is called Dynamical Systems, and applications of that have been
used to study RG flows. For example, the classical Zamolodchikov's C-Theorem
and its higher-dimensional counterparts, that show that there is a
monotonically decreasing function along the flow and it is a property that
resembles the second-law of thermodynamics, is related to the Lyapunov function
in the context of Dynamical Systems. It can be used to rule out exotic
asymptotic behaviours like periodic flows (also known as limit cycles). We also
study bifurcation theory and index theories, which have been proposed to be
useful in the study of RG flows, the former can be used to explain couplings
crossing through marginality and the latter to extract global information about
the space the flows lives in. In this dissertation, we also look for
applications in holographic RG flows and we try to see if the structural
behaviours in holographic theories are the same as the ones in the dual field

gases in optical lattices constructed by the widely used straightforward
mean-field decoupling of the hopping term, where the corresponding mean-field
Hamiltonian generally assumes no lower energy bound once the spatial dependence
of the mean-field superfluid order parameter is taken into account. Via a
systematic functional integral approach, we solve this issue by establishing a
general finite temperature mean-field theory that can treat any possible
spatial dependence of the order parameter without causing the divergent issue.
Interestingly, we find the theory generally assumes an intrinsic non-hermitian
structure that originates from the indefiniteness of the hopping matrix of the
system. Within this theory, we develop an efficient approach for investigating
the physics of the system at finite temperature, where properties of the system
can be calculated via straightforward investigation on the saddle points of an
effective potential function for the order parameter. We illustrate our
approach by investigating the finite temperature superfluid transition of Bose
gases in optical lattices. Since the underlying finite temperature mean-field
theory is quite general, this approach can be straightforwardly applied to

it is becoming an urgent issue to combine machine intelligence with human

fonts are available online for public usage, it is difficult and challenging to
generate and explore a font to meet the preferences for common users. To solve
the specific issue, we propose the perceptual manifold of fonts to visualize
the perceptual adjustment in the latent space of a generative model of fonts.
In our framework, we adopt the variational autoencoder network for the font
generation. Then, we conduct a perceptual study on the generated fonts from the
multi-dimensional latent space of the generative model. After we obtained the
distribution data of specific preferences, we utilize manifold learning
approach to visualize the font distribution. In contrast to the conventional
user interface in our user study, the proposed font-exploring user interface is
efficient and helpful in the designated user preference.

to produce demonstrations, which may be costly in practice. To address this
shortcoming, we propose Probabilistic Planning for Demonstration Discovery

leverage widely-used planning algorithms such as Rapidly-exploring Random Tree
to find demonstration trajectories. These demonstrations are used to initialize
a policy, then refined by a generic RL algorithm. We provide theoretical
guarantees of P2D2 finding successful trajectories, as well as bounds for its
sampling complexity. We experimentally demonstrate the method outperforms
classic and intrinsic exploration RL techniques in a range of classic control
and robotics tasks, requiring only a fraction of exploration samples and
achieving better asymptotic performance.

backend helps to increase resources utilization. Even if tenants use dedicated
queues and threads to achieve performance isolation, threads are still contend
for CPU cores. Therefore, we argue that it is necessary to partition cores
between LC and BE tenants, and meanwhile each core is dedicated to run a
thread. Expect for frequently changing bursty load, fluctuated service time at
storage backend also drastically changes the need of cores. In order to
guarantee tail latency service level objectives (SLOs), the abrupt changing
need of cores must be satisfied immediately. Otherwise, tail latency SLO
violation happens. Unfortunately, partitioning-based approaches lack the
ability to react the changing need of cores, resulting in extreme spikes in
latency and SLO violation happens. In this paper, we present QWin, a tail
latency SLO aware core allocation to enforce tail latency SLO at shared storage
backend. QWin consists of an SLO-to-core calculation model that accurately
calculates the number of cores combining with definitive runtime load
determined by a flexible request-based window, and an autonomous core
allocation that adjusts cores at adaptive frequency by dynamically changing
core policies. When consolidating multiple LC and BE tenants, QWin outperforms
the-state-of-the-art approaches in guaranteeing tail latency SLO for LC tenants

statistics, but strikingly little is known about how to efficiently solve it
without restrictive conditions on the design matrix. We consider the
(correlated) random design setting, where the covariates are independently
drawn from a multivariate Gaussian $N(0,\Sigma)$ with $\Sigma : n \times n$,
and seek estimators $\hat{w}$ minimizing $(\hat{w}-w^*)^T\Sigma(\hat{w}-w^*)$,
where $w^*$ is the $k$-sparse ground truth. Information theoretically, one can
achieve strong error bounds with $O(k \log n)$ samples for arbitrary $\Sigma$
and $w^*$; however, no efficient algorithms are known to match these guarantees
even with $o(n)$ samples, without further assumptions on $\Sigma$ or $w^*$. As
far as hardness, computational lower bounds are only known with worst-case
design matrices. Random-design instances are known which are hard for the
Lasso, but these instances can generally be solved by Lasso after a simple
change-of-basis (i.e. preconditioning).
  In this work, we give upper and lower bounds clarifying the power of
preconditioning in sparse linear regression. First, we show that the
preconditioned Lasso can solve a large class of sparse linear regression
problems nearly optimally: it succeeds whenever the dependency structure of the
covariates, in the sense of the Markov property, has low treewidth -- even if
$\Sigma$ is highly ill-conditioned. Second, we construct (for the first time)
random-design instances which are provably hard for an optimally preconditioned
Lasso. In fact, we complete our treewidth classification by proving that for
any treewidth-$t$ graph, there exists a Gaussian Markov Random Field on this
graph such that the preconditioned Lasso, with any choice of preconditioner,
requires $\Omega(t^{1/20})$ samples to recover $O(\log n)$-sparse signals when
covariates are drawn from this model.

\textit{services computing}, a rapidly-expanding academic community since

research problems in services computing, such as service selection, service
composition, service recommendation, and service quality prediction. An obvious
fact is that most services keep constant changes to timely adapt to changes of
external business/technical environment and changes of internal development
strategies. However, traditional services computing research does not consider
such changes sufficiently. Many works regard services as \textit{static}
entities; this leads to the situation that some proposed models/algorithms do
not work in real world. Sensing various types of service changes is of great
significance to the practicability and rationality of services computing
research. In this paper, a new research problem \textit{External Service
Sensing} (ESS) is defined to cope with various changes in services, and a
research framework of ESS is presented to elaborate the scope and boundary of
ESS. This framework is composed of four orthogonal dimensions: sensing objects,
sensing contents, sensing channels, and sensing techniques. Each concrete ESS
problem is defined by combining different values in these dimensions, and
existing research work related to service changes can be well adapted to this
framework. Real-world case studies demonstrate the soundness of ESS and its

dust-gas mixture by extending smoothed particle magnetohydrodynamics. We employ
the single-species particle approach to describe dust-gas mixture with several
modifications from the previous studies. We assume that the charged and neutral
dusts can be treated as single-fluid and the electro-magnetic force acts on the
gas and that on the charged dust is negligible. The validity of these
assumption in the context of protostar formation is not obvious and is
extensively evaluated. By investigating the electromagnetic force and electric
current with terminal velocity approximation, it is found that as the dust size
increases, the contribution of dust to them becomes smaller and negligible. We
conclude that our assumptions of the electro-magnetic force on the dusts is
negligible are valid for the dust size with a d & 10{\mu}m. On the other hand,
they do not produce the numerical artifact for the dust a d . 10{\mu}m in
envelope and disk where the perfect coupling between gas and dusts realizes.
However, we also found that our assumptions may break down in outflow (or under
environment with very strong magnetic field and low density) for the dust a d .
10{\mu}m. We conclude that our assumptions are valid in almost all cases where
macroscopic dust dynamics is important in the context of protostar formation.
We conduct numerical tests of dusty wave, dusty magnetohydrodynamics shock, and
gravitational collapse of magnetized cloud core with our simulation code. The
results show that our numerical scheme well reproduces the dust dynamics in the
magnetized medium.

adapted to a downstream NLP task. However, theoretical analysis of these models
is scarce and challenging since the pretraining and downstream tasks can be
very different. We propose an analysis framework that links the pretraining and
downstream tasks with an underlying latent variable generative model of text --
the downstream classifier must recover a function of the posterior distribution
over the latent variables. We analyze head tuning (learning a classifier on top
of the frozen pretrained model) and prompt tuning in this setting. The
generative model in our analysis is either a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or an
HMM augmented with a latent memory component, motivated by long-term
dependencies in natural language. We show that 1) under certain non-degeneracy
conditions on the HMM, simple classification heads can solve the downstream
task, 2) prompt tuning obtains downstream guarantees with weaker non-degeneracy
conditions, and 3) our recovery guarantees for the memory-augmented HMM are
stronger than for the vanilla HMM because task-relevant information is easier
to recover from the long-term memory. Experiments on synthetically generated
data from HMMs back our theoretical findings.

previous training step, as well as the noise distribution in this sampled
batch. Experiments show that HGL can effectively denoise the weakly-labeled
data retrieved from distant supervision, and therefore results in significant
improvements on the trained models.

relativistic kinetic theory of a dilute gas propagating on a curved spacetime
manifold (M,g) of arbitrary dimension. Special emphasis is made on geometric
aspects of the theory in order to achieve a formulation which is manifestly
covariant on the relativistic phase space. Whereas most previous work has
focussed on the tangent bundle formulation, here we work on the cotangent
bundle associated with (M,g) which is more naturally adapted to the Hamiltonian
framework of the theory. In the first part of this work we discuss the relevant
geometric structures of the cotangent bundle T*M, starting with the natural
symplectic form on T*M, the one-particle Hamiltonian and the Liouville vector
field, defined as the corresponding Hamiltonian vector field. Next, we discuss
the Sasaki metric on T*M and its most important properties, including the role
it plays for the physical interpretation of the one-particle distribution
function. In the second part of this work we describe the general relativistic
theory of a collisionless gas, starting with the derivation of the
collisionless Boltzmann equation for a neutral simple gas. Subsequently, the
description is generalized to a charged gas consisting of several species of
particles and the general relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell equations are derived for
this system. The last part of this work is devoted to a transparent derivation
of the collision term, leading to the general relativistic Boltzmann equation
on (M,g). The meaning of global and local equilibrium and the stringent
restrictions for the existence of the former on a curved spacetime are
discussed. We close this article with an application of our formalism to the
expansion of a homogeneous and isotropic universe filled with a collisional
simple gas and its behavior in the early and late epochs. [abbreviated version]

increases squarely with the length of the sentence. In this paper, a
prob-sparse self-attention mechanism is introduced into Conformer to sparse the
computing process of self-attention in order to accelerate inference speed and
reduce space consumption. Specifically, we adopt a Kullback-Leibler divergence
based sparsity measurement for each query to decide whether we compute the
attention function on this query. By using the prob-sparse attention mechanism,
we achieve impressively 8% to 45% inference speed-up and 15% to 45% memory

that not only the network structure but also node attributes can be preserved
in the embedding space. Existing ANE models do not consider the specific
combination between graph structure and attributes. While each node has its
structural characteristics, such as highly-interconnected neighbors along with
their certain patterns of attribute distribution, each node's neighborhood
should be not only depicted by multi-hop nodes, but consider certain clusters
or social circles. To model such information, in this paper, we propose a novel
ANE model, Context Co-occurrence-aware Attributed Network Embedding (CoANE).
The basic idea of CoANE is to model the context attributes that each node's
involved diverse patterns, and apply the convolutional mechanism to encode
positional information by treating each attribute as a channel. The learning of
context co-occurrence can capture the latent social circles of each node. To
better encode structural and semantic knowledge of nodes, we devise a three-way
objective function, consisting of positive graph likelihood, contextual
negative sampling, and attribute reconstruction. We conduct experiments on five
real datasets in the tasks of link prediction, node label classification, and
node clustering. The results exhibit that CoANE can significantly outperform
state-of-the-art ANE models.

measurement of the charge separation is made difficult by the presence of a

found that the charge separation, with the flow background removed, is
consistent with zero in peripheral (large impact parameter) collisions. Some

with the improved material assignment at the element level for achieving the
desired discreteness of the optimized designs for pressure-loaded problems.
Hexagonal elements are employed to parametrize the design domain. Such elements
provide nonsingular local connectivity; thus, checkerboard patterns and point
connections inherently get subdued. Elliptical negative masks are used to find
the optimized material layout. Each mask is represented via seven parameters
that describe the location, shape, orientation, material dilation, and erosion
variables of the mask. The latter two variables are systematically varied in
conjunction with a grayscale measure constraint to achieve the solutions'
sought 0-1 nature. Darcy's law with a drainage term is used to model the
pressure load. The obtained pressure field is converted into the consistent
nodal forces using Wachspress shape functions. Sensitivities of the objective
and pressure load are evaluated using the adjoint-variable method. The efficacy
and robustness of the approach are demonstrated by solving various
pressure-loaded structures and pressure-driven compliant mechanisms. Compliance
is minimized for loadbearing structures, whereas a multicriteria objective is
minimized for mechanism designs. The boundary smoothing scheme is implemented
within each optimization iteration to subdue the designs' undulated boundaries.

convert images from one domain to another using unpaired training data sets
from different domains. Unfortunately, these approaches still require centrally
collected unpaired records, potentially violating privacy and security issues.
Although the recent federated learning (FL) allows a neural network to be
trained without data exchange, the basic assumption of the FL is that all
clients have their own training data from a similar domain, which is different
from our image-to-image translation scenario in which each client has images
from its unique domain and the goal is to learn image translation between
different domains without accessing the target domain data. To address this,
here we propose a novel federated CycleGAN architecture that can learn image
translation in an unsupervised manner while maintaining the data privacy.
Specifically, our approach arises from a novel observation that CycleGAN loss
can be decomposed into the sum of client specific local objectives that can be
evaluated using only their data. This local objective decomposition allows
multiple clients to participate in federated CycleGAN training without
sacrificing performance. Furthermore, our method employs novel switchable
generator and discriminator architecture using Adaptive Instance Normalization
(AdaIN) that significantly reduces the band-width requirement of the federated
learning. Our experimental results on various unsupervised image translation
tasks show that our federated CycleGAN provides comparable performance compared
to the non-federated counterpart.

  based Perception in Autonomous Driving Under Physical-World Attacks","Accepted by IEEE S&P 2021",,"10.1109/SP40001.2021.00076",,"cs.CR cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In Autonomous Driving (AD) systems, perception is both security and safety
critical. Despite various prior studies on its security issues, all of them
only consider attacks on camera- or LiDAR-based AD perception alone. However,
production AD systems today predominantly adopt a Multi-Sensor Fusion (MSF)
based design, which in principle can be more robust against these attacks under
the assumption that not all fusion sources are (or can be) attacked at the same
time. In this paper, we present the first study of security issues of MSF-based
perception in AD systems. We directly challenge the basic MSF design assumption
above by exploring the possibility of attacking all fusion sources
simultaneously. This allows us for the first time to understand how much
security guarantee MSF can fundamentally provide as a general defense strategy
for AD perception.
  We formulate the attack as an optimization problem to generate a
physically-realizable, adversarial 3D-printed object that misleads an AD system
to fail in detecting it and thus crash into it. We propose a novel attack
pipeline that addresses two main design challenges: (1) non-differentiable
target camera and LiDAR sensing systems, and (2) non-differentiable cell-level
aggregated features popularly used in LiDAR-based AD perception. We evaluate
our attack on MSF included in representative open-source industry-grade AD
systems in real-world driving scenarios. Our results show that the attack
achieves over 90% success rate across different object types and MSF. Our
attack is also found stealthy, robust to victim positions, transferable across
MSF algorithms, and physical-world realizable after being 3D-printed and
captured by LiDAR and camera devices. To concretely assess the end-to-end
safety impact, we further perform simulation evaluation and show that it can
cause a 100% vehicle collision rate for an industry-grade AD system.

commonly applied to protect surface assets from threats. Such decoys portray
fake assets to lure threats away from the true asset. To deceive a threat, a
decoy first has to position itself such that it can break the radar lock.
Considering multiple simultaneous threats, this paper introduces an approach
for controlling multiple decoys to minimise the time required to break the
locks of all the threats. The method includes the optimal allocation of one
decoy to every threat with an assignment procedure that provides local position
constraints to guarantee collision avoidance and thereby decouples the control
of the decoys. A crude model of a decoy with uncertainty is considered for
motion planning. The task of a decoy reaching a state in which the lock of the
assigned threat can be broken is formulated as a temporal logic specification.
To this end, the requirements to complete the task are modelled as time-varying
set-membership constraints. The temporal and logical combination of the
constraints is encoded in a mixed-integer optimisation problem. To demonstrate
the results a simulated case study is provided.

have to act under different observation spaces. This situation brings
significant obstacles to existing imitation learning approaches, since most of

previous studies under different observation spaces have strong assumptions
that these two observation spaces coexist during the entire learning process.
However, in reality, the observation coexistence will be limited due to the
high cost of acquiring expert observations. In this work, we study this
challenging problem with limited observation coexistence under heterogeneous
observations: Heterogeneously Observable Imitation Learning (HOIL). We identify
two underlying issues in HOIL: the dynamics mismatch and the support mismatch,
and further propose the Importance Weighting with REjection (IWRE) algorithm

autonomous robots. Many learning-based methods have been proposed to learn an
exploration strategy. In the frontier-based exploration, learning algorithms
tend to learn the optimal or near-optimal frontier to explore. Most of these
methods represent the environments as fixed size images and take these as
inputs to neural networks. However, the size of environments is usually
unknown, which makes these methods fail to generalize to real world scenarios.
To address this issue, we present a novel state representation method based on
4D point-clouds-like information, including the locations, frontier, and
distance information. We also design a neural network that can process these 4D
point-clouds-like information and generate the estimated value for each
frontier. Then this neural network is trained using the typical reinforcement
learning framework. We test the performance of our proposed method by comparing
it with other five methods and test its scalability on a map that is much
larger than maps in the training set. The experiment results demonstrate that
our proposed method needs shorter average traveling distances to explore whole
environments and can be adopted in maps with arbitrarily sizes.

issues for federated learning (FL)-based mobile application services, taking
into account limited computing/communications resources at mobile users
(MUs)/mobile application provider (MAP), privacy cost, the rationality and
incentive competition among MUs in contributing data to the MAP. Particularly,
the MAP first determines a set of the best MUs for the FL process based on the
MUs' provided information/features. To mitigate straggling problems with
privacy-awareness, each selected MU can then encrypt part of local data and
upload the encrypted data to the MAP for an encrypted training process, in
addition to the local training process. For that, each selected MU can propose
a contract to the MAP according to its expected trainable local data and
privacy-protected encrypted data. To find the optimal contracts that can
maximize utilities of the MAP and all the participating MUs while maintaining
high learning quality of the whole system, we first develop a multi-principal
one-agent contract-based problem leveraging FL-based multiple utility
functions. These utility functions account for the MUs' privacy cost, the MAP's
limited computing resources, and asymmetric information between the MAP and
MUs. Then, we transform the problem into an equivalent low-complexity problem
and develop a light-weight iterative algorithm to effectively find the optimal
solutions. Experiments with a real-world dataset show that our framework can
speed up training time up to 49% and improve prediction accuracy up to 4.6
times while enhancing the network's social welfare, i.e., total utility of all
participating entities, up to 114% under the privacy cost consideration
compared with those of baseline methods.

star-forming regions. Our models show that radical-radical association on
grains are necessary to explain the observed abundance of DCOOCH$_3$ in the

enhance the abundances of HCOOCHD$_2$, DCOOCHD$_2$, and HCOOCD$_3$. The
observed abundance of HCOOCHD$_2$ in IRAS 16293--2422 can only be reproduced if
H-D substitution reactions are taken into account. However, HCOOCH$_2$D remain

important role in the context of lottery ticket hypothesis. Ramanujan et al.
(2020) empirically showed that only pruning the weights can achieve remarkable
performance instead of optimizing the weight values. However, to achieve the
same level of performance as the weight optimization, the pruning approach
requires more parameters in the networks before pruning and thus more memory
space. To overcome this parameter inefficiency, we introduce a novel framework
to prune randomly initialized neural networks with iteratively randomizing
weight values (IteRand). Theoretically, we prove an approximation theorem in
our framework, which indicates that the randomizing operations are provably
effective to reduce the required number of the parameters. We also empirically
demonstrate the parameter efficiency in multiple experiments on CIFAR-10 and

wall-resolved large-eddy simulation (LES). Our consideration is made on LES of
turbulent channel flows with a first grid point set relatively far from the
wall ($\sim$ 10 wall units), while still resolving the near-wall region, to
present a new path to save the computational cost. Convolutional neural network
(CNN) is utilized to estimate a virtual wall-surface velocity from $x-z$
sectional fields near the wall, whose training data are generated by a direct
numerical simulation (DNS) at ${\rm Re}_{\tau}=180$. The virtual wall-surface
velocity is prepared with the extrapolation of the DNS data near the wall. This
idea enables us to give a proper wall condition to correct a velocity gradient
near the wall. The estimation ability of the model from near wall information
is first investigated as a priori test. The estimated velocity fields by the
present CNN model are in statistical agreement with the reference DNS data. The
model trained in a priori test is then combined with the LES as a posteriori
test. We find that the LES can successfully be augmented using the present
model at both the friction Reynolds number ${\rm Re}_{\tau}=180$ used for
training and the unseen Reynolds number ${\rm Re}_{\tau}=360$ even when the
first grid point is located at 5 wall units off the wall. We also investigate
the robustness of the present model for the choice of sub-grid scale model and
the possibility of transfer learning in a local domain. The observations
through the paper suggest that the present model is a promising tool for
recovering the accuracy of LES with a coarse grid near the wall.

gravitationally-lensed synchrotron emission from hot plasma orbiting around the
black hole. In the accretion flows around low-luminosity active galactic nuclei
such as M87, electrons and ions are not in thermal equilibrium. Therefore, the
electron temperature, which is important for the thermal synchrotron radiation
at EHT frequencies of 230 GHz, is not independently determined. In this work,
we investigate the commonly used parameterised ion-to-electron temperature
ratio prescription, the so-called R-$\beta$ model, considering images at 230
GHz by comparing with electron-heating prescriptions obtained from
general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamical (GRMHD) simulations of magnetised
accretion flows in a Magnetically Arrested Disc (MAD) regime with different
recipes for the electron thermodynamics. When comparing images at 230 GHz, we
find a very good match between images produced with the R-$\beta$ prescription
and those produced with the turbulent- and magnetic reconnection- heating
prescriptions. Indeed, this match is on average even better than that obtained
when comparing the set of images built with the R-$\beta$ prescription with
either a randomly chosen image or with a time-averaged one. From this
comparative study of different physical aspects, which include the image,
visibilities, broadband spectra, and light curves, we conclude that, within the
context of images at 230 GHz relative to MAD accretion flows around
supermassive black holes, the commonly-used and simple R-$\beta$ model is able
to reproduce well the various and more complex electron-heating prescriptions
considered here.

multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. Some associated signal
processing tasks consider these channels in a symmetric way, i.e. by assigning
the same role to all channel inputs, and similarly to all channel outputs.
These tasks especially include channel identification/estimation and channel
equalization, tightly connected with source separation. Their most challenging
version is the blind one, i.e. when the receivers have (almost) no prior
knowledge about the emitted signals. Other signal processing tasks consider
classical communication channels in an asymmetric way. This especially includes
the situation when data are sent by Emitter 1 to Receiver 1 through a main
channel, and an ""intruder"" (including Receiver 2) interferes with that channel
so as to extract information, thus performing so-called eavesdropping, while
Receiver 1 may aim at detecting that intrusion. Part of the above processing
tasks have been extended to quantum channels, including those that have several
quantum bits (qubits) at their input and output. For such quantum channels,
beyond previously reported work for symmetric scenarios, we here address
asymmetric (blind and non-blind) ones, with emphasis on intrusion detection and
additional comments about eavesdropping. To develop fundamental concepts, we
first consider channels with exchange coupling as a toy model. We especially
use the general quantum information processing framework that we recently
developed, to derive new attractive intrusion detection methods based on a
single preparation of each state. Finally, we discuss how the proposed methods
might be extended, beyond the specific class of channels analyzed here.

a very competitive alternative to such methods.
  We rigorously prove (optimal) sub-linear convergence of the scheme for

only requires very mild step size restrictions, which illustrates the good
stability properties. The analysis is based on a priori estimates more

  representation learning","update some content of the paper and polish the language!",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The attention mechanism enables graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn the
attention weights between the target node and its one-hop neighbors, thereby
improving the performance further. However, most existing GNNs are oriented
toward homogeneous graphs, and in which each layer can only aggregate the
information of one-hop neighbors. Stacking multilayer networks introduces
considerable noise and easily leads to over smoothing. We propose here a
multihop heterogeneous neighborhood information fusion graph representation
learning method (MHNF). Specifically, we propose a hybrid metapath autonomous
extraction model to efficiently extract multihop hybrid neighbors. Then, we
formulate a hop-level heterogeneous information aggregation model, which
selectively aggregates different-hop neighborhood information within the same
hybrid metapath. Finally, a hierarchical semantic attention fusion model (HSAF)
is constructed, which can efficiently integrate different-hop and
different-path neighborhood information. In this fashion, this paper solves the
problem of aggregating multihop neighborhood information and learning hybrid
metapaths for target tasks. This mitigates the limitation of manually
specifying metapaths. In addition, HSAF can extract the internal node
information of the metapaths and better integrate the semantic information
present at different levels. Experimental results on real datasets show that
MHNF achieves the best or competitive performance against state-of-the-art
baselines with only a fraction of 1/10 ~ 1/100 parameters and computational
budgets. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/PHD-lanyu/MHNF.

vital shopping channel in people's life. The retrieval phase of products

attention. Retrieving the most relevant products from a large-scale corpus
while preserving personalized user characteristics remains an open question.
Recent approaches in this domain have mainly focused on embedding-based
retrieval (EBR) systems. However, after a long period of practice on Taobao, we
find that the performance of the EBR system is dramatically degraded due to
its: (1) low relevance with a given query and (2) discrepancy between the
training and inference phases. Therefore, we propose a novel and practical
embedding-based product retrieval model, named Multi-Grained Deep Semantic
Product Retrieval (MGDSPR). Specifically, we first identify the inconsistency
between the training and inference stages, and then use the softmax
cross-entropy loss as the training objective, which achieves better performance
and faster convergence. Two efficient methods are further proposed to improve
retrieval relevance, including smoothing noisy training data and generating
relevance-improving hard negative samples without requiring extra knowledge and
training procedures. We evaluate MGDSPR on Taobao Product Search with
significant metrics gains observed in offline experiments and online A/B tests.
MGDSPR has been successfully deployed to the existing multi-channel retrieval
system in Taobao Search. We also introduce the online deployment scheme and

(HMC) architecture employing the conventional PDN design with clustered layout
of power and ground TSVs. We then present a new PDN design with a distributed
layout of power and ground TSVs and show that it can mitigate the adverse
effects of EM on the HMC architecture performance without requiring additional
power and ground pins. Our benchmark-driven simulation-based analysis shows
that compared to the clustered PDN layout, our proposed distributed PDN layout
improves the EM-affected lifetime of the HMC architecture by up to 10 years.
During this useful lifetime, the HMC architecture yields up to 1.51 times less
energy-delay product (EDP).

applicability in resource-constrained devices is limited due to their
computational load. While modern devices exhibit a high level of parallelism,
real-time latency is still highly dependent on networks' depth. Although recent
works show that below a certain depth, the width of shallower networks must
grow exponentially, we presume that neural networks typically exceed this
minimal depth to accelerate convergence and incrementally increase accuracy.
This motivates us to transform pre-trained deep networks that already exploit
such advantages into shallower forms. We propose a method that learns whether
non-linear activations can be removed, allowing to fold consecutive linear
layers into one. We apply our method to networks pre-trained on CIFAR-10 and
CIFAR-100 and find that they can all be transformed into shallower forms that
share a similar depth. Finally, we use our method to provide more efficient
alternatives to MobileNetV2 and EfficientNet-Lite architectures on the ImageNet

develop a general trace formula and understand them on an arbitrary group. Then
we specialize this general formula to study quaternionic automorphic

the Eichler-Selberg trace formula for classical modular forms. We finally use
this together with some techniques of Chenevier, Renard, and Ta\""ibi to compute

that regularity miraculously does not matter for specifically the case of

previous result on alphabets of these integrals. As the main example, we
consider hexagon kinematics with two massive corners on opposite sides and find
a truncated affine $D_4$ cluster algebra whose polytopal realization is a
co-dimension 4 boundary of that of $G_+(4,8)/T$ with 39 facets; the normal
vectors for 38 of them correspond to g-vectors and the remaining one gives a
limit ray, which yields an alphabet of $38$ rational letters and $5$ algebraic

integrable symbols with this alphabet and physical first-entry conditions,
whose dimension can be reduced using conditions from a truncated version of
cluster adjacency. Already at weight $4$, by imposing last-entry conditions
inspired by the $n=8$ double-pentagon integral, we are able to uniquely
determine an integrable symbol that gives the algebraic part of the most

design aiming at directly maximizing the convergence speed. Towards this end,
we first analyze the convergence behavior of Air-FEEL (in terms of the
optimality gap) subject to aggregation errors at different communication
rounds. It is revealed that if the aggregation estimates are unbiased, then the
training algorithm would converge exactly to the optimal point with mild
conditions; while if they are biased, then the algorithm would converge with an
error floor determined by the accumulated estimate bias over communication
rounds. Next, building upon the convergence results, we optimize the power
control to directly minimize the derived optimality gaps under both biased and
unbiased aggregations, subject to a set of average and maximum power
constraints at individual edge devices. We transform both problems into convex
forms, and obtain their structured optimal solutions, both appearing in a form
of regularized channel inversion, by using the Lagrangian duality method.
Finally, numerical results show that the proposed power control policies
achieve significantly faster convergence for Air-FEEL, as compared with
benchmark policies with fixed power transmission or conventional MSE
minimization.

document the process of designing, implementing, maintaining, analyzing, and

development of quantum or classical programs in isolation. Additionally, the
various programs must be orchestrated, e.g., using workflows. Thus, the
development of quantum applications also incorporates the workflow lifecycle.
In this chapter, we analyze the software artifacts usually comprising a quantum

identify the points of connection between the various lifecycles and integrate
them into the overall quantum software development lifecycle. Therefore, the

observations are scarce or corrupted, the learning task becomes much harder.The
question is: how much harder? In this paper, we study the properties of a
partially-observed Vector AutoRegressive process, which is a state-space model
endowed with a stochastic observation mechanism.Our goal is to estimate its
sparse transition matrix, but we only have access to a small and noisy
subsample of the state components.Interestingly, the sampling process itself is
random and can exhibit temporal correlations, a feature shared by many
realistic data acquisition scenarios.We start by describing an estimator based
on the Yule-Walker equation and the Dantzig selector, and we give an upper
bound on its non-asymptotic error.Then, we provide a matching minimax lower
bound, thus proving near-optimality of our estimator.The convergence rate we
obtain sheds light on the role of several key parameters such as the sampling
ratio, the amount of noise and the number of non-zero coefficients in the
transition matrix.These theoretical findings are commented and illustrated by
numerical experiments on simulated data.

least linearly with momentum, the bounds result in an asymptotic formula for
the effective mass quotient, a quantity generalizing the usual notion of the
effective mass. This asymptotic form agrees with the semiclassical
Landau--Pekar formula and can be regarded as the first rigorous confirmation,
in a slightly weaker sense than usually considered, of the validity of the

fingers. Each finger performs spatial movements to achieve more complex and
varied grasping than the existing planar-movement fingers. The purpose of this
hand is to grasp complex-shaped workpieces as they leave the machining centres.
Among the taxonomy of grips, cylindrical and spherical grips are often used to
grasp heavy objects. A combination of these two modes makes it possible to
capture most of the workpieces machined with 5-axis machines. However, the
change in grasping mode requires the fingers to reconfigure themselves to
perform spatial movements. This solution requires the addition of two or three
actuators to change the position of the fingers and requires sensors to
recognize the shape of the workpiece and determine the type of grasp to be
used. This article proposes to extend the notion of under-actuated fingers to
spatial movements. After a presentation of the kinematics of the fingers, the
problem of stability is discussed as well as the transmission of forces in this
mechanism. The complete approach for calculating the stability conditions is
presented from the study of Jacobian force transmission matrices. CAD
representations of the hand and its behavior in spherical and cylindrical grips

and simple observables. The expectation value of the Hamiltonian is then
minimized with respect to a parameterized quantum state. Because the number of
decomposed terms is independent of the size of the problem, this method
requires relatively few quantum measurements. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the faster computing speed of this method compared with classical computing

engineering different nanophotonic devices in analogy with microelectronics.
While recent studies of the topic have been predominantly focused on linear

Here, we extend the metactronics paradigm and add nonlinear dynamical

can operate in the regimes of tristable and astable multivibrators as well as
chaos generators. The physical mechanism behind these modalities relies on the
Kerr-type nonlinearity of nanoparticles in the dimer enhanced by a dipolar
localized surface plasmon resonance. This allows one to provide a positive
nonlinear feedback at moderate optical intensities, leading to the desired

shared among users connected over the internet. Transactions are data state
changes on the blockchain that are permanently recorded in a secure and
transparent way without the need of a third party. Besides, the introduction of
smart contracts to the blockchain has added programmability to the blockchain
and revolutionized the software ecosystem leading toward decentralized
applications (DApps) attracting businesses and organizations to employ this
technology. Although promising, blockchains and smart contracts have no access
to the external systems (i.e., off-chain) where real-world data and events
resides; consequently, the usability of smart contracts in terms of performance
and programmability would be limited to the on-chain data. Hence,
\emph{blockchain oracles} are introduced to mitigate the issue and are defined
as trusted third-party services that send and verify the external information
(i.e., feedback) and submit it to smart contracts for triggering state changes
in the blockchain. In this paper, we will study and analyze blockchain oracles
with regard to how they provide feedback to the blockchain and smart contracts.
We classify the blockchain oracle techniques into two major groups such as
voting-based strategies and reputation-based ones. The former mainly relies on
participants' stakes for outcome finalization while the latter considers
reputation in conjunction with authenticity proof mechanisms for data
correctness and integrity. We then provide a structured description of patterns
in detail for each classification and discuss research directions in the end.

Calculations are performed utilizing recursive Green's function method, and
Coulomb interactions are treated selfconsistently within Hubbard $I$

of states, apart from Majorana resonance. One pair of particle-hole symmetric

diminished, while it is not altered when single-particle tunneling dominates in

perturbs the gradients on gradient-carrier matrices and reconstructs an update
for the original weight from the noisy gradients. Importantly, we use
historical updates to find the gradient-carrier matrices, whose optimality is
rigorously justified under linear regression and empirically verified with deep

utility. For example, we are the first able to apply differential privacy on
the BERT model and achieve an average accuracy of $83.9\%$ on four downstream

of active regions in the far hemisphere of the Sun based on the interpretation
of oscillations measured in the near hemisphere. A neural network has been
recently developed to improve the sensitivity of the seismic maps to the
presence of far-side active regions. Aims. Our aim is to evaluate the
performance of the new neural network approach and to thoroughly compare it
with the standard method commonly applied to predict far-side active regions
from seismic measurements. Methods. We have computed the predictions of active
regions using the neural network and the standard approach from five years of
far-side seismic maps as a function of the selected threshold in the signatures
of the detections. The results have been compared with direct extreme
ultraviolet observations of the far hemisphere acquired with the Solar
Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO). Results. We have confirmed the
improved sensitivity of the neural network to the presence of far-side active
regions. Approximately 96% of the active regions identified by the standard
method with a strength above the threshold commonly employed by previous
analyses are related to locations with enhanced extreme ultraviolet emission.
For this threshold, the false positive ratio is 3.75%. For an equivalent false
positive ratio, the neural network produces 47% more true detections. Weaker
active regions can be detected by relaxing the threshold in their seismic
signature. Conclusions. The neural network is a promising approach to improve
the interpretation of the seismic maps provided by local helioseismic
techniques.

ranging from spin- or mass-imbalanced atomic gases and graphene to quantum
chromo-dynamics at finite density to the non-equilibrium evolution of quantum
systems. Many computational approaches have been developed for tackling the
sign problem emerging for complex actions. Among these, complex Langevin
dynamics has the appeal of general applicability. One of its key challenges is
the potential convergence of the dynamics to unphysical fixed points. The
statistical sampling process at such a fixed point is not based on the physical
action and hence leads to wrong predictions. Moreover, its unphysical nature is
hard to detect due to the implicit nature of the process. In the present work
we set up a general approach based on a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme in an
extended state space. In this approach we derive an explicit real sampling
process for generalized complex Langevin dynamics. Subject to a set of
constraints, this sampling process is the physical one. These constraints
originate from the detailed-balance equations satisfied by the Monte Carlo
scheme. This allows us to re-derive complex Langevin dynamics from a new
perspective and establishes a framework for the explicit construction of new
sampling schemes for complex actions.

particularly large in low-mass graphene membranes, which makes them promising
candidates for pressure sensing applications. Here, we study the squeeze-film
effect in single layer graphene resonators and find that their resonance
frequency is lower than expected from models assuming ideal compression. To
understand this deviation, we perform Boltzmann and continuum finite-element
simulations, and propose an improved model that includes the effects of gas
leakage and can account for the observed pressure dependence of the resonance

However, in contrast to conventional power plants, renewable energy is subject
to uncertainty raising challenges for their interaction with power systems.
Scenario-based probabilistic forecasting models have become a vital tool to
equip decision-makers. This paper presents to the power systems forecasting
practitioners a recent deep learning technique, the normalizing flows, to
produce accurate scenario-based probabilistic forecasts that are crucial to
face the new challenges in power systems applications. The strength of this
technique is to directly learn the stochastic multivariate distribution of the
underlying process by maximizing the likelihood. Through comprehensive
empirical evaluations using the open data of the Global Energy Forecasting
Competition 2014, we demonstrate that this methodology is competitive with
other state-of-the-art deep learning generative models: generative adversarial
networks and variational autoencoders. The models producing weather-based wind,
solar power, and load scenarios are properly compared in terms of forecast
value by considering the case study of an energy retailer and quality using
several complementary metrics. The numerical experiments are simple and easily
reproducible. Thus, we hope it will encourage other forecasting practitioners
to test and use normalizing flows in power system applications such as bidding

applications, such as estimating path ranking in path recommendation systems

a large amount of labeled training data and generalize poorly to other tasks.
We propose an unsupervised learning framework Path InfoMax (PIM) to learn
generic path representations that work for different downstream tasks. We first
propose a curriculum negative sampling method, for each input path, to generate
a small amount of negative paths, by following the principles of curriculum
learning. Next, \emph{PIM} employs mutual information maximization to learn
path representations from both a global and a local view. In the global view,
PIM distinguishes the representations of the input paths from those of the
negative paths. In the local view, \emph{PIM} distinguishes the input path
representations from the representations of the nodes that appear only in the
negative paths. This enables the learned path representations to encode both
global and local information at different scales. Extensive experiments on two
downstream tasks, ranking score estimation and travel time estimation, using
two road network datasets suggest that PIM significantly outperforms other
unsupervised methods and is also able to be used as a pre-training method to
enhance supervised path representation learning.

from the statistics community. The convex partial correlation selection method
(CONCORD) developed by Khare et al. (2015) has recently been credited with some
theoretical properties for estimating sparse precision matrices. The CONCORD
obtains its solution by a coordinate descent algorithm (CONCORD-CD) based on
the convexity of the objective function. However, since a coordinate-wise
update in CONCORD-CD is inherently serial, a scale-up is nontrivial. In this
paper, we propose a novel parallelization of CONCORD-CD, namely, CONCORD-PCD.
CONCORD-PCD partitions the off-diagonal elements into several groups and
updates each group simultaneously without harming the computational convergence
of CONCORD-CD. We guarantee this by employing the notion of edge coloring in
graph theory. Specifically, we establish a nontrivial correspondence between
scheduling the updates of the off-diagonal elements in CONCORD-CD and coloring
the edges of a complete graph. It turns out that CONCORD-PCD simultaneously
updates off-diagonal elements in which the associated edges are colorable with
the same color. As a result, the number of steps required for updating
off-diagonal elements reduces from p(p-1)/2 to p-1 (for even p) or p (for odd
p), where p denotes the number of variables. We prove that the number of such
steps is irreducible In addition, CONCORD-PCD is tailored to single-instruction
multiple-data (SIMD) parallelism. A numerical study shows that the
SIMD-parallelized PCD algorithm implemented in graphics processing units (GPUs)
boosts the CONCORD-CD algorithm multiple times.

tend to be overconfident in their predictions. It poses a significant challenge
for safety-critical systems to utilise deep neural networks (DNNs), reliably.
Many recently proposed approaches to mitigate this have demonstrated
substantial progress in improving DNN calibration. However, they hardly touch
upon refinement, which historically has been an essential aspect of
calibration. Refinement indicates separability of a network's correct and
incorrect predictions. This paper presents a theoretically and empirically
supported exposition reviewing refinement of a calibrated model. Firstly, we
show the breakdown of expected calibration error (ECE), into predicted
confidence and refinement under the assumption of over-confident predictions.
Secondly, linking with this result, we highlight that regularization based
calibration only focuses on naively reducing a model's confidence. This
logically has a severe downside to a model's refinement as correct and
incorrect predictions become tightly coupled. Lastly, connecting refinement
with ECE also provides support to existing refinement based approaches which
improve calibration but do not explain the reasoning behind it. We support our
claims through rigorous empirical evaluations of many state of the art
calibration approaches on widely used datasets and neural networks. We find
that many calibration approaches with the likes of label smoothing, mixup etc.
lower the usefulness of a DNN by degrading its refinement. Even under natural
data shift, this calibration-refinement trade-off holds for the majority of
calibration methods.

multi-fluid equations for atmospheric convection. In this paper we develop a
simple two-fluid, single-column model with one rising and one falling fluid. No
further modelling of sub-filter variability is included. We then apply this
model to Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection, showing that, with minimal closures,
the correct scaling of the heat flux (Nu) is predicted over six orders of
magnitude of buoyancy forcing (Ra). This suggests that even a very simple
two-fluid model can accurately capture the dominant coherent overturning
structures of convection.

statistics. Despite many practical applications of kernel-based feature
selection, there is little statistical theory available to support the method.
A core challenge is the objective function of the optimization problems used to
define kernel-based feature selection are nonconvex. The literature has only
studied the statistical properties of the \emph{global optima}, which is a
mismatch, given that the gradient-based algorithms available for nonconvex
optimization are only able to guarantee convergence to local minima. Studying
the full landscape associated with kernel-based methods, we show that feature
selection objectives using the Laplace kernel (and other $\ell_1$ kernels) come
with statistical guarantees that other kernels, including the ubiquitous
Gaussian kernel (or other $\ell_2$ kernels) do not possess. Based on a sharp
characterization of the gradient of the objective function, we show that
$\ell_1$ kernels eliminate unfavorable stationary points that appear when using
an $\ell_2$ kernel. Armed with this insight, we establish statistical
guarantees for $\ell_1$ kernel-based feature selection which do not require
reaching the global minima. In particular, we establish model-selection
consistency of $\ell_1$-kernel-based feature selection in recovering main
effects and hierarchical interactions in the nonparametric setting with $n \sim
\log p$ samples.

transfer a learner from a different source domain. Previous deep domain
adaptation methods mainly learn a global domain shift, i.e., align the global
source and target distributions without considering the relationships between
two subdomains within the same category of different domains, leading to
unsatisfying transfer learning performance without capturing the fine-grained
information. Recently, more and more researchers pay attention to Subdomain
Adaptation which focuses on accurately aligning the distributions of the
relevant subdomains. However, most of them are adversarial methods which
contain several loss functions and converge slowly. Based on this, we present
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) which learns a transfer network by
aligning the relevant subdomain distributions of domain-specific layer
activations across different domains based on a local maximum mean discrepancy
(LMMD). Our DSAN is very simple but effective which does not need adversarial
training and converges fast. The adaptation can be achieved easily with most
feed-forward network models by extending them with LMMD loss, which can be
trained efficiently via back-propagation. Experiments demonstrate that DSAN can
achieve remarkable results on both object recognition tasks and digit

limiting issue for UV aluminum plasmonics, as this phenomenon occurs
significantly faster in presence of UV light, even at low laser powers of a few
microwatts. Here we assess the performance of nanometer-thick layers of various
metal oxides deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) and plasma-enhanced
chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) on top of aluminum nanoapertures to protect
the metal against UV photocorrosion. The combination of a 5 nm Al2O3 layer
covered by a 5 nm TiO2 capping provides the best resistance performance, while
a single 10 nm layer of SiO2 or HfO2 is a good alternative. We also report the
influence of the laser wavelength, the laser operation mode and the pH of the

optical powers for which the aluminum nanostructures can be used. As
application, we demonstrate the label-free detection of streptavidin proteins
with improved signal to noise ratio. Our approach is also beneficial to promote
the long-term stability of the aluminum nanostructures. Finding the appropriate

coefficient, inferred for electrons with median energies of $\sim160$~TeV, is
consistent with those obtained from the extended halos around Geminga and

the nominal timescale sensitivity of 21 ms revised to be in the range of 20 -
22 ms, which does not significantly affect the results of the experiment. The
correction system will be adopted into the final version of high cadence
imaging experiment, which is currently under construction. The correction
system is inexpensive (<$A100) and composed of readily available hardware, and
is readily adaptable to other applications. Design details and codes are
therefore made publicly available.

requires consent, both 1) to access and store information on users' devices and
2) to legitimate the processing of personal data as part of third-party

  This paper further investigates whether and to what extent consent is
implemented in mobile apps. First, we analyse a representative sample of apps
from the Google Play Store. We find that most apps engage in third-party
tracking, but few obtained consent before doing so, indicating potentially
widespread violations of EU and UK privacy law. Second, we examine the most

they rely on app developers to obtain consent on their behalf, they typically
fail to put in place robust measures to ensure this: disclosure of consent
requirements is limited; default consent implementations are lacking; and
compliance guidance is difficult to find, hard to read, and poorly maintained.

utmost importance in understanding the working principles of the human brain in
health and disease. In existing literature, functional brain connectomes have
been used successfully to predict cognitive measures such as intelligence
quotient (IQ) scores in both healthy and disordered cohorts using machine
learning models. However, existing methods resort to flattening the brain
connectome (i.e., graph) through vectorization which overlooks its topological
properties. To address this limitation and inspired from the emerging graph
neural networks (GNNs), we design a novel regression GNN model (namely RegGNN)
for predicting IQ scores from brain connectivity. On top of that, we introduce
a novel, fully modular sample selection method to select the best samples to
learn from for our target prediction task. However, since such deep learning
architectures are computationally expensive to train, we further propose a
\emph{learning-based sample selection} method that learns how to choose the
training samples with the highest expected predictive power on unseen samples.
For this, we capitalize on the fact that connectomes (i.e., their adjacency
matrices) lie in the symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix cone. Our results
on full-scale and verbal IQ prediction outperforms comparison methods in autism
spectrum disorder cohorts and achieves a competitive performance for
neurotypical subjects using 3-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, we show that
our sample selection approach generalizes to other learning-based methods,
which shows its usefulness beyond our GNN architecture.

philosophical questions. Mathematical questions concern the definition of the
path integral to include integration over spacetime regions with different
signatures of the metric. One possible way to describe the changes in the
signature is to admit time and space coordinates to be purely imaginary. It may
look like a generalization of what we have in the case of pseudo-Riemannian
manifolds with a non-trivial topology. The signature in these regions can be
fixed by special gauge conditions on components of the metric tensor. The
problem is what boundary conditions should be imposed on the boundaries of
these regions and how they should be taken into account in the definition of
the path integral. The philosophical question is what distinguishes the time
coordinate among other coordinates but the sign of the corresponding principal
value of the metric tensor. In particular, I try to speculate how the existence
of the regions with different signature can affect the evolution of the
Universe.

brain tumour survival prediction. All models are quantitatively evaluated using
standard performance metrics. The rule lists are also qualitatively assessed

Sagnac effect was first introduced by Yao et al, which included the Sagnac

measuring linear motion with nanoscale sensitivity. By using a different scheme
to perform the Sagnac interferometer with the probe in momentum space, we have
demonstrated the new weak measure protocol to detect the linear velocity by
amplifying the phase shift of the generalized Sagnac effect. Given the maximum
incident intensity of the initial spectrum, the detection limit of the
intensity of the spectrometer, we can theoretically give the appropriate
pre-selection, post-selection, and other optical structures before the
experiment. Our numerical results show our scheme with Weak-value amplification
is effective and feasible to detect linear velocity with picometer/second
sensitivity which is three orders of magnitude smaller than the result

attributes a monetary value to the hydrographic phenomena (i.e., cross-shore

(DApps) have become increasingly popular and important. To balance the
security, performance, and costs, a DApp typically consists of two layers: an
on-chain layer to execute transactions and store crucial data on the blockchain
and an off-chain layer to interact with users. A DApp needs to synchronize its
off-chain layer with the on-chain layer proactively. Otherwise, the
inconsistent data in the off-chain layer could mislead users and cause
undesirable consequences, e.g., loss of transaction fees. However, transactions
sent to the blockchain are not guaranteed to be executed and could even be
reversed after execution due to chain reorganization. Such non-determinism in
the transaction execution is unique to blockchain. DApp developers may fail to
perform the on-chain-off-chain synchronization accurately due to their lack of
familiarity with the complex transaction lifecycle. In this work, we
investigate the challenges of synchronizing on-chain and off-chain data in
Ethereum-based DApps. We present two types of bugs that could result in
inconsistencies between the on-chain and off-chain layers. To help detect such
on-chain-off-chain synchronization bugs, we introduce a state transition model

the automatic identification of bugs. We build the first testing framework,

SOM QE is applied to double color staining based cell viability data in 96
image simulations. The results show that the SOM QE consistently and in only a
few seconds detects fine regular spatial increases in relative amounts of RED
or GREEN pixel staining across the test images, reflecting small, systematic
increases or decreases in the percentage of theoretical cell viability below
the critical threshold. Such small changes may carry clinical significance, but
are almost impossible to detect by human vision. Moreover, we demonstrate a
clear sensitivity of the SOM QE to differences in the relative physical
luminance (Y) of the colors, which here translates into a RED GREEN color
selectivity. Across differences in relative luminance, the SOM QE exhibits
consistently greater sensitivity to the smallest spatial increases in RED image
pixels compared with smallest increases of identical spatial extents in GREEN
image pixels. Further selective color contrast studies on simulations of
biological imaging data will allow generating increasingly larger benchmark
datasets and, ultimately, unravel the full potential of fast, economic, and
unprecedentedly precise biological data analysis using the SOM QE.

solve an ill-conditioned constrained optimization problem. Therefore, we build
a neural network surrogate model to close the moment system, which preserves

DocNLI -- a newly-constructed large-scale dataset for document-level NLI.
DocNLI is transformed from a broad range of NLP problems and covers multiple
genres of text. The premises always stay in the document granularity, whereas
the hypotheses vary in length from single sentences to passages with hundreds
of words. Additionally, DocNLI has pretty limited artifacts which unfortunately
widely exist in some popular sentence-level NLI datasets. Our experiments
demonstrate that, even without fine-tuning, a model pretrained on DocNLI shows
promising performance on popular sentence-level benchmarks, and generalizes
well to out-of-domain NLP tasks that rely on inference at document granularity.
Task-specific fine-tuning can bring further improvements. Data, code, and

candidate SRGe~J0023+3625 = G116.6-26.1 found in the SRG/eROSITA all-sky
survey. The source features a large angular extent ($\sim 4$ deg in diameter),
nearly circular shape and X-ray spectrum dominated by emission lines of helium-
and hydrogen-like oxygen. It lacks bright counterparts of similar extent at
other wavelengths which could be unequivocally associated with it. Given the
relatively high Galactic latitude of the source, $b\approx-26$ deg, we
interpret these observational properties as an indication of the off-disk
location of this SNR candidate. Namely, we propose that this object originated
from a Type Ia supernova which exploded some 40 000 yr ago in the low density
($\sim 10^{-3}\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$) and hot ($\sim (1-2)\times10^6\,{\rm K}$) gas
of the Milky Way halo at a distance of $\sim 3\,{\rm kpc}$ from the Sun. The
low density of the halo gas implies that the cooling and collisional ionization
equilibrium (CEI) timescales downstream of the forward shock are much longer
than the age of the SNR. This results in a relatively soft spectrum, reflecting
pre-shock ionization state of the gas, and strong boost in the plasma
emissivity (compared to CEI) due to enhanced collisional excitation through the
increased electron temperature. If confirmed, such a rare object would provide
us with a unique ""in situ"" probe of physical conditions (density, temperature
and metallicity) near the interface between the Milky Way's disk and the halo.

find a continuous increase of the delay for clusters containing up to 4-5

first increases with cluster size and then partially localizes through the
onset of structural disorder that is characteristic of large clusters and bulk

We calculate the invariant form factors representing decay amplitudes from the
overlapping integrals of meson wave functions derivable in the RIQ model. To
evaluate the lepton mass effects in the semileptonic decays, we first study the
$q^2$-dependence of the form factors in the accessible kinematic range of $q^2$

economic applications, where data represent people, this can lead to
discrimination of underrepresented gender and ethnic groups. Given the
importance of bias mitigation in machine learning, the topic leads to
contentious debates on how to ensure fairness in practice (data bias versus
algorithmic bias). Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) seemingly
addresses this problem by minimizing the worst expected risk across
subpopulations. We establish theoretical results that clarify the relation
between DRO and the optimization of the same loss averaged on an adequately
weighted training dataset. The results cover finite and infinite number of
training distributions, as well as convex and non-convex loss functions. We
show that neither DRO nor curating the training set should be construed as a
complete solution for bias mitigation: in the same way that there is no
universally robust training set, there is no universal way to setup a DRO
problem and ensure a socially acceptable set of results. We then leverage these
insights to provide a mininal set of practical recommendations for addressing
bias with DRO. Finally, we discuss ramifications of our results in other
related applications of DRO, using an example of adversarial robustness. Our
results show that there is merit to both the algorithm-focused and the
data-focused side of the bias debate, as long as arguments in favor of these
positions are precisely qualified and backed by relevant mathematics known

finance, ...), including some that are strongly related to our day-to-day life
(e.g., social networks, computers, smartphones, ...). In machine learning,
significant improvements are usually achieved at the price of an increasing
computational complexity and thanks to bigger datasets. Currently, cutting-edge
models built by the most advanced machine learning algorithms typically became
simultaneously very efficient and profitable but also extremely complex. Their
complexity is to such an extent that these models are commonly seen as
black-boxes providing a prediction or a decision which can not be interpreted
or justified. Nevertheless, whether these models are used autonomously or as a
simple decision-making support tool, they are already being used in machine
learning applications where health and human life are at stake. Therefore, it
appears to be an obvious necessity not to blindly believe everything coming out
of those models without a detailed understanding of their predictions or
decisions. Accordingly, this thesis aims at improving the interpretability of
models built by a specific family of machine learning algorithms, the so-called
tree-based methods. Several mechanisms have been proposed to interpret these
models and we aim along this thesis to improve their understanding, study their
properties, and define their limitations.

markets. Internet advertising platforms typically offer advertisers the
possibility to pace the rate at which their budget is depleted, through
budget-pacing mechanisms. We focus on multiplicative pacing mechanisms in an
online setting in which a bidder is repeatedly confronted with a series of
advertising opportunities. After collecting bids, each item is then allocated
through a single-item, second-price auction. If there were no budgetary
constraints, bidding truthfully would be an optimal choice for the advertiser.
However, since their budget is limited, the advertiser may want to shade their
bid downwards in order to preserve their budget for future opportunities, and
to spread expenditures evenly over time. The literature on online pacing
problems mostly focuses on the setting in which the bidder optimizes an
additive separable objective, such as the total click-through rate or the
revenue of the allocation. In many settings, however, bidders may also care
about other objectives which oftentimes are non-separable, and therefore not
amenable to traditional online learning techniques. Building on recent work, we
study the frequent case in which advertisers seek to reach a certain
distribution of impressions over a target population of users. We introduce a
novel regularizer to achieve this desideratum, and show how to integrate it
into an online mirror descent scheme attaining the optimal order of sub-linear
regret compared to the optimal allocation in hindsight when inputs are drawn
independently, from an unknown distribution. Moreover, we show that our
approach can easily be incorporated in standard existing pacing systems that
are not usually built for this objective. The effectiveness of our algorithm in

spectroscopic properties. This is due to the different potential formation
channels and the stripping mechanism that allows for a large diversity within
the progenitors outer envelop compositions. Here, the photometric and
spectroscopic observations of SN 2020cpg covering $\sim 130$ days from the
explosion date are presented. SN 2020cpg ($z = 0.037$) is a bright SE-SNe with
the $B$-band peaking at $M_{B} = -17.75 \pm 0.39$ mag and a maximum
pseudo-bolometric luminosity of $L_\mathrm{max} = 6.03 \pm 0.01 \times 10^{42}
\mathrm{ergs^{-1}}$. Spectroscopically, SN 2020cpg displays a weak high and low
velocity H$\alpha$ feature during the photospheric phase of its evolution,
suggesting that it contained a detached hydrogen envelope prior to explosion.
From comparisons with spectral models, the mass of hydrogen within the outer
envelope was constrained to be $\sim 0.1 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. From the
pseudo-bolometric light curve of SN 2020cpg a $^{56}$Ni mass of $M_\mathrm{Ni}
\sim 0.27 \pm 0.08$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ was determined using an Arnett-like
model. The ejecta mass and kinetic energy of SN 2020cpg were determined using
an alternative method that compares the light curve of SN 2020cpg and several
modelled SE-SNe, resulting in an ejecta mass of $M_\mathrm{ejc} \sim 5.5 \pm
2.0$ $\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and a kinetic energy of $E_\mathrm{K} \sim 9.0 \pm
3.0 \times 10^{51} \mathrm{erg}$. The ejected mass indicates a progenitor mass
of $18 - 25 \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. The use of the comparative light curve method
provides an alternative process to the commonly used Arnett-like model to
determine the physical properties of SE-SNe.

its importance for severe weather warnings. Here, we provide a comprehensive
review and systematic comparison of eight statistical and machine learning
methods for probabilistic wind gust forecasting via ensemble postprocessing,
that can be divided in three groups: State of the art postprocessing techniques
from statistics (ensemble model output statistics (EMOS), member-by-member
postprocessing, isotonic distributional regression), established machine
learning methods (gradient-boosting extended EMOS, quantile regression forests)
and neural network-based approaches (distributional regression network,
Bernstein quantile network, histogram estimation network). The methods are
systematically compared using six years of data from a high-resolution,
convection-permitting ensemble prediction system that was run operationally at
the German weather service, and hourly observations at 175 surface weather
stations in Germany. While all postprocessing methods yield calibrated
forecasts and are able to correct the systematic errors of the raw ensemble
predictions, incorporating information from additional meteorological predictor
variables beyond wind gusts leads to significant improvements in forecast
skill. In particular, we propose a flexible framework of locally adaptive
neural networks with different probabilistic forecast types as output, which
not only significantly outperform all benchmark postprocessing methods but also
learn physically consistent relations associated with the diurnal cycle,
especially the evening transition of the planetary boundary layer.

much larger than those for the standard Kolmogorov turbulence. This leads to
faster grain coagulation in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks,

velocities VR and VT in small bins along the distance R. The distribution of
observed velocities appears to have some specific features: the radial velocity
VR demonstrates a smooth fall from +5 km s-1 at the distance of R=R0-1.5 kpc to
-3 km s-1 at R=R0+1.0 kpc while the azimuthal velocity VT shows a sharp drop by
7 km s-1 in the distance interval R0<R<R0+1.0 kpc, where R0 is the solar
Galactocentric distance. We build a model of the Galaxy including bulge, bar,
disc and halo components, which reproduces the observed specific features of
the velocity distribution in the Galactocentric distance interval |R-R0|< 1.5
kpc. The best agreement corresponds to the time 1.8+/-0.5 Gyr after the start
of the simulation. A model of the Galaxy with the bar rotating at the angular
velocity of Omega_b=55+/-3 km s-1 kpc-1, which sets the OLR of the bar at the
distance of R0-0.5+/-0.4 kpc, provides the best agreement between the model and
observed velocities. The position angle of the bar, theta_b, corresponding to
the best agreement between the model and observed velocities is theta_b=45+/-15
degrees.

adversarial examples. Yet, its passive nature inevitably prevents it from being
immune to unknown attackers. To achieve a proactive defense, we need a more
fundamental understanding of adversarial examples, beyond the popular bounded
threat model. In this paper, we provide a causal viewpoint of adversarial
vulnerability: the cause is the spurious correlation ubiquitously existing in
learning, i.e., the confounding effect, where attackers are precisely
exploiting these effects. Therefore, a fundamental solution for adversarial
robustness is by causal intervention. As these visual confounders are
imperceptible in general, we propose to use the instrumental variable that
achieves causal intervention without the need for confounder observation. We
term our robust training method as Causal intervention by instrumental Variable
(CiiV). It's a causal regularization that 1) augments the image with multiple
retinotopic centers and 2) encourages the model to learn causal features,
rather than local confounding patterns, by favoring features linearly
responding to spatial interpolations. Extensive experiments on a wide spectrum
of attackers and settings applied in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and mini-ImageNet
demonstrate that CiiV is robust to adaptive attacks, including the recent
AutoAttack. Besides, as a general causal regularization, it can be easily
plugged into other methods to further boost the robustness.

Existing methods fail to produce satisfactory results due to the limitation on
inferring reliable depth information over such challenging reference
conditions. With the popularization of commercial light field (LF) cameras,
capturing LF images (LFIs) is as convenient as taking regular photos, and
geometry information can be reliably inferred. This inspires us to use a sparse
set of LF captures to render high-quality novel views globally. However, fusion
of LF captures from multiple angles is challenging due to the scale
inconsistency caused by various capture settings. To overcome this challenge,
we propose a novel scale-consistent volume rescaling algorithm that robustly
aligns the disparity probability volumes (DPV) among different captures for
scale-consistent global geometry fusion. Based on the fused DPV projected to
the target camera frustum, novel learning-based modules have been proposed
(i.e., the attention-guided multi-scale residual fusion module, and the
disparity field guided deep re-regularization module) which comprehensively
regularize noisy observations from heterogeneous captures for high-quality
rendering of novel LFIs. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments over the
Stanford Lytro Multi-view LF dataset show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods significantly under different experiment settings for

motivate new paradigms of collecting and analyzing data that are transparent

corresponding data formats, mechanisms, and theories for privatizing data
during data collection. The privacy, named Interval Privacy, enforces the raw
data conditional distribution on the privatized data to be the same as its
unconditional distribution over a nontrivial support set. Correspondingly, the
proposed privacy mechanism will record each data value as a random interval
(or, more generally, a range) containing it. The proposed interval privacy
mechanisms can be easily deployed through survey-based data collection
interfaces, e.g., by asking a respondent whether its data value is within a
randomly generated range. Another unique feature of interval mechanisms is that
they obfuscate the truth but do not perturb it. Using narrowed range to convey
information is complementary to the popular paradigm of perturbing data. Also,
the interval mechanisms can generate progressively refined information at the
discretion of individuals, naturally leading to privacy-adaptive data
collection. We develop different aspects of theory such as composition,
robustness, distribution estimation, and regression learning from
interval-valued data. Interval privacy provides a new perspective of
human-centric data privacy where individuals have a perceptible, transparent,

regularisation. We express bare scalar operators in terms of renormalised
composite operators of low dimension, then do this with traceless tensor
operators. We then express the bare energy momentum tensor in terms of the
renormalised composite operators, with some terms having divergent
coefficients. We subtract these away and obtain a manifestly finite energy
tensor. The subtracted terms are transverse, so this does not affect the
conservation of the energy momentum tensor. The trace of this finite improved
energy momentum tensor vanishes at the fixed point indicating conformal
invariance. Interestingly it is not RG-invariant except at the fixed point, but
can be made RG invariant everywhere by further addition of transverse terms,
whose coefficients vanish at the fixed point.

algorithms that promises to combine the speedups of quantum computation with
the widespread successes of machine learning. A major challenge in QNN
development is a concentration of measure phenomenon known as a barren plateau
that leads to exponentially small gradients for a range of QNNs models. In this
work, we examine the assumptions that give rise to barren plateaus and show
that an unbounded loss function can circumvent the existing no-go results. We
propose a training algorithm that minimizes the maximal R\'enyi divergence of
order two and present techniques for gradient computation. We compute the
closed form of the gradients for Unitary QNNs and Quantum Boltzmann Machines
and provide sufficient conditions for the absence of barren plateaus in these

and Hamiltonian learning. In our numerical experiments, we observed rapid
convergence of our training loss function and frequently archived a $99\%$
average fidelity in fewer than $100$ epochs.

stoichiometry and to the valence states of the transition-metal ions. Defect
engineering has become increasingly popular as it offers the possibility to
influence the catalytic properties of perovskites for applications in energy
storage and conversion devices such as solid-oxide fuel- and electrolyzer
cells. LaFeO$_3$ (LFO) can be regarded as a base compound of the family of
catalytically active perovskites La$_{1-x}$A$_x$Fe$_{1-y}$B$_y$O$_{3-\delta}$,
for which the defect chemistry as well as the electronic and ionic conductivity
can be tuned by substitution on cationic sites. Combining theoretical and
experimental approaches, we explore the suitability for A-site vacancy
engineering, namely the feasibility of actively manipulating the valence state
of Fe and the concentration of point defects by synthesizing La-deficient LFO.
Formation energies and concentrations of point defects were determined as a
function of processing conditions by first-principles DFT+U calculations. Based
on the results, significant compositional deviations from stoichiometric LFO
cannot be expected by providing rich or poor conditions of the oxidic precursor
compounds (Fe$_2$O$_3$ and La$_2$O$_3$) in a solid-state processing route. In
the experimental part, LFO was synthesized with a targeted La-site deficiency.
We analyze the resulting phases by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron
microscopy, (scanning) transmission electron microscopy in combination with
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and electron energy-loss spectrometry.
Instead of a variation of the La/Fe ratio, a mixture of the two phases
Fe$_2$O$_3$ and LFO was observed, resulting in an invariant charge state of Fe,
in line with the theoretical results. We discuss our findings with respect to
partly differing assumptions made in previous studies on this material system.

select the samples on which parameter values are chosen. For parameters that do

labelled in order to achieve a desired accuracy on the whole dataset. In
regression tasks this is typically achieved using a query by committee strategy
that selects the samples on which a committee of models is most uncertain. I
implement such a strategy for the first break picking task, where the
parameters to be chosen are the centre and width of the picking window for each
trace. For the committee members I use the centre of the picking window and
three popular picking algorithms. Applying this to a real dataset, and with
samples corresponding to shot gathers, the active learning approach primarily
selects gathers near a jump in the first breaks, and achieves similar levels of
accuracy on the whole dataset with about half the number samples picked as when

electromagnetic response due to collective modes in a Weyl semimetal gapped by
a quasi one-dimensional charge-density wave order, using both continuum and
lattice regularized models. We systematically compute the contributions of the
collective modes to the linear and nonlinear optical conductivity of our
models, both with and without tilting of the Weyl cones. We discover that,
unlike in a single-band CDW, the gapless CDW collective mode does not
contribute to the conductivity unless the Weyl cones are tilted. Going further,
we show that the lowest nontrivial collective mode contribution to charge
transport with untilted Weyl cones comes in the third-order conductivity, and
is mediated by the gapped amplitude mode. We show that this leads to a sharply
peaked third harmonic response at frequencies below the single-particle energy
gap. We discuss the implications of our findings for transport experiments in
Weyl-CDW systems.

each only with access to local data, jointly learn a global model. There has
recently been an explosion of research aiming not only to improve the accuracy
rates of federated learning, but also provide certain guarantees around social
good properties such as total error. One branch of this research has taken a
game-theoretic approach, and in particular, prior work has viewed federated
learning as a hedonic game, where error-minimizing players arrange themselves
into federating coalitions. This past work proves the existence of stable
coalition partitions, but leaves open a wide range of questions, including how
far from optimal these stable solutions are. In this work, we motivate and
define a notion of optimality given by the average error rates among federating
agents (players). First, we provide and prove the correctness of an efficient
algorithm to calculate an optimal (error minimizing) arrangement of players.
Next, we analyze the relationship between the stability and optimality of an
arrangement. First, we show that for some regions of parameter space, all
stable arrangements are optimal (Price of Anarchy equal to 1). However, we show
this is not true for all settings: there exist examples of stable arrangements
with higher cost than optimal (Price of Anarchy greater than 1). Finally, we
give the first constant-factor bound on the performance gap between stability
and optimality, proving that the total error of the worst stable solution can
be no higher than 9 times the total error of an optimal solution (Price of
Anarchy bound of 9).

exploiting matching context information. Two main contexts are identified,
originated respectively from the descriptor space and from the keypoint space.
The former is generally used to design the actual matching strategy while the
latter to filter matches according to the local spatial consistency. On this
basis, a new matching strategy and a novel local spatial filter, named
respectively blob matching and Delaunay Triangulation Matching (DTM) are
devised. Blob matching provides a general matching framework by merging
together several strategies, including rank-based pre-filtering as well as
many-to-many and symmetric matching, enabling to achieve a global improvement
upon each individual strategy. DTM alternates between Delaunay triangulation
contractions and expansions to figure out and adjust keypoint neighborhood
consistency. Experimental evaluation shows that DTM is comparable or better
than the state-of-the-art in terms of matching accuracy and robustness.
Evaluation is carried out according to a new benchmark devised for analyzing
the matching pipeline in terms of correct correspondences on both planar and
non-planar scenes, including several state-of-the-art methods as well as the
common SIFT matching approach for reference. This evaluation can be of
assistance for future research in this field.

overall agreement between the theoretical and experimental results is very good
for all three calculated spectra. By comparisons with the independent particle
approximation based sum-over-states method, we show that excitonic effects mix
the independent particle transition peaks to new excitonic ones. The position
and intensity of spectral peaks are modified significantly. By tracing the
sum-over-states progress, we determine the type of nonlinear polarization
resonances for the characteristic peaks of third harmonic generation process,
which may clear up a discrepancy in two experimental results.

  2021",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Vaccines are an important public health measure, but vaccine hesitancy and
refusal can create clusters of low vaccine coverage and reduce the
effectiveness of vaccination programs. Social media provides an opportunity to
estimate emerging risks to vaccine acceptance by including geographical
location and detailing vaccine-related concerns. Methods for classifying social
media posts, such as vaccine-related tweets, use language models (LMs) trained
on general domain text. However, challenges to measuring vaccine sentiment at
scale arise from the absence of tonal stress and gestural cues and may not
always have additional information about the user, e.g., past tweets or social
connections. Another challenge in LMs is the lack of commonsense knowledge that
are apparent in users metadata, i.e., emoticons, positive and negative words
etc. In this study, to classify vaccine sentiment tweets with limited
information, we present a novel end-to-end framework consisting of
interconnected components that use domain-specific LM trained on
vaccine-related tweets and models commonsense knowledge into a bidirectional
gated recurrent network (CK-BiGRU) with context-aware attention. We further
leverage syntactical, user metadata and sentiment information to capture the
sentiment of a tweet. We experimented using two popular vaccine-related Twitter
datasets and demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models in identifying pro-vaccine, anti-vaccine and neutral
tweets.

and more detectors joining the international network, the chances of detection
of a stochastic GW background (SGWB) are progressively increasing. Different
astrophysical and cosmological processes are likely to give rise to backgrounds
with distinct spectral signatures and distributions on the sky. The observed
SGWB will therefore be a superposition of these components. Hence, one of the
first questions that will come up after the first detection of a SGWB will
likely be about identifying the dominant components and their distributions on
the sky. Both these questions were addressed separately in the literature,
namely, how to separate components of isotropic backgrounds and how to probe
the anisotropy of a single component. Here, we address the question of how to
separate distinct anisotropic backgrounds with (sufficiently) different
spectral shapes. We first obtain the combined Fisher information matrix from
folded data using an efficient analysis pipeline PyStoch, which incorporates
covariances between pixels and spectral indices. This is necessary for
estimating the detection statistic and setting upper limits. However, based on
a recent study, we ignore the pixel-to-pixel noise covariance that does not
have a significant effect on the results at the present sensitivity levels of
the detectors. We show that the joint analysis accurately separates and
estimates backgrounds with different spectral shapes and different sky
distributions with no major bias. This does come at the cost of increased
variance. Thus making the joint upper limits safer, though less strict than the
individual analysis. We finally set joint upper limits on the multicomponent
anisotropic background using Advanced LIGO data taken up to the first half of
the third observing run.

angular scales and cause a suppression on the amplitude of the matter power
spectrum. We find that on adding Planck-CMB data, the graviton has a small,
positive, but non-zero mass at 68\% confidence level, and from this
perspective, we show that the tension between redshift space distortions
measurements and Planck-CMB data in the parametric space $S_8 - \Omega_m$ can

we find that the $H_0$ tension between the CMB and the local distance ladder

time series data requires methods to deal with the uncertainty of the
underlying data and the used simulation model. Bayesian inference is well
suited for these uncertain inverse problems. Standard methods used to identify
uncertain parameters are Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods with explicit
evaluation of a likelihood function. However, if the likelihood is very
complex, such that its evaluation is computationally expensive, or even unknown
in its explicit form, Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methods provide a
promising alternative. In this work both methods are first applied to
artificially generated data and second on a real world problem, by using data
of an electric motor test bench. We show that both methods are able to infer
the distribution of varying parameters with a Bayesian hierarchical approach.
But the proposed ABC method is computationally much more efficient in order to
achieve results with similar accuracy. We suggest to use summary statistics in
order to reduce the dimension of the data which significantly increases the
efficiency of the algorithm. Further the simulation model is replaced by a
Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) surrogate to speed up model evaluations. We
proof consistency for the proposed surrogate-based ABC method with summary
statistics under mild conditions on the (approximated) forward model.

such that the metric between the UV and the IR brane is AdS$_5$, thus solving
the hierarchy problem, and beyond the IR brane the metric is that of a linear

be considered as an approximation of a more complicated (and smooth) one, leads
to analytical Green's functions (with a mass gap $m_g \sim \textrm{TeV}$ and a
continuum for $s > m_g^2$) which could then be easily incorporated in the
experimental codes. The theory contains Standard Model gauge bosons in the bulk

interactions. A special feature of these systems is that the binding energy
scales with single particle tunneling $t$ rather than exchange interactions,
since effective attraction arises from alleviating kinetic frustration. For two
component Fermi systems on a zigzag ladder we find a bound state between a hole
and a flipped spin (magnon) with a binding energy that can be as large as
$0.6t$. We demonstrate that magnon-hole attraction leads to formation of

s\ell^+\ell^-$ with a significance of $\!>3\,\sigma$, $>\!4\,\sigma$ and
$>\!5\,\sigma$, respectively. Furthermore, in a recent re-analysis of 2018
Belle data, it was found that the forward-backward asymmetry ($\Delta A_{\rm
FB}$) of $B \to D^{*}\mu\bar \nu$ vs $B\to D^{*}e\bar \nu$ disagrees with the
SM prediction by $\approx\!\!4\,\sigma$, providing an additional sign of LFU

the agreement with data in $\Delta A_{\rm FB}$ while respecting the bounds from
other $b\to c\ell\nu$ observables. Importantly, this tensor operator can only
be induced (at tree-level within renormalizable models) by a scalar leptoquark.
Furthermore, among the two possible representations, the $SU(2)_L$-singlet
$S_1$ and the doublet $S_2$, which can interestingly both also account for the
anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, only $S_1$ can provide a good fit. Even
though the constraints from (differences of) other angular observables prefer a
smaller value of $\Delta A_{\rm FB}$ than the current central one, this
scenario is significantly preferred (nearly $4 \sigma$) over the SM hypothesis,
and is compatible with constraints such as $B\to K^*\nu\nu$ and electroweak
precision bounds. Therefore, if the $\Delta A_{\rm FB}$ anomaly is confirmed,
it would provide circumstantial evidence for scalar leptoquarks and pave the
way for a natural connection with all other anomalies pointing towards LFU
violation.

  Segmentation","20 pages, CVPR2023",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we aim to enhance model-based face reconstruction by avoiding
fitting the model to outliers, i.e. regions that cannot be well-expressed by
the model such as occluders or make-up. The core challenge for localizing
outliers is that they are highly variable and difficult to annotate. To
overcome this challenging problem, we introduce a joint Face-autoencoder and
outlier segmentation approach (FOCUS).In particular, we exploit the fact that
the outliers cannot be fitted well by the face model and hence can be localized
well given a high-quality model fitting. The main challenge is that the model
fitting and the outlier segmentation are mutually dependent on each other, and
need to be inferred jointly. We resolve this chicken-and-egg problem with an
EM-type training strategy, where a face autoencoder is trained jointly with an
outlier segmentation network. This leads to a synergistic effect, in which the
segmentation network prevents the face encoder from fitting to the outliers,
enhancing the reconstruction quality. The improved 3D face reconstruction, in
turn, enables the segmentation network to better predict the outliers. To
resolve the ambiguity between outliers and regions that are difficult to fit,
such as eyebrows, we build a statistical prior from synthetic data that
measures the systematic bias in model fitting. Experiments on the NoW testset
demonstrate that FOCUS achieves SOTA 3D face reconstruction performance among
all baselines that are trained without 3D annotation. Moreover, our results on
CelebA-HQ and the AR database show that the segmentation network can localize
occluders accurately despite being trained without any segmentation annotation.

represented by either a graph (where atoms are connected by bonds) or a SMILES
sequence (where depth-first-search is applied to the molecular graph with
specific rules). Existing works on molecule pre-training use either graph
representations only or SMILES representations only. In this work, we propose
to leverage both the representations and design a new pre-training algorithm,
dual-view molecule pre-training (briefly, DMP), that can effectively combine
the strengths of both types of molecule representations. The model of DMP
consists of two branches: a Transformer branch that takes the SMILES sequence
of a molecule as input, and a GNN branch that takes a molecular graph as input.
The training of DMP contains three tasks: (1) predicting masked tokens in a
SMILES sequence by the Transformer branch, (2) predicting masked atoms in a
molecular graph by the GNN branch, and (3) maximizing the consistency between
the two high-level representations output by the Transformer and GNN branches
separately. After pre-training, we can use either the Transformer branch (this
one is recommended according to empirical results), the GNN branch, or both for
downstream tasks. DMP is tested on nine molecular property prediction tasks and
achieves state-of-the-art performances on seven of them. Furthermore, we test

hexagonal closed-packed Co$(10\bar{1}0)[0001]$ $\parallel$ face-centered cubic

with the measured magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant and thickness of Co.
In future ultrathin multilayer films, we expect this epitaxial relationship to
further enable an anisotropic DMI while supporting interfacial perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy. The anticipated confluence of these properties, along with
the tunability of multilayer films, make this material system a promising
testbed for unveiling new spin configurations in FM/HM films.

longitudinal dispersion coefficient(LDC). Various methods have been proposed
for predictions of LDC. Those studies can be grouped into three types:
analytical, statistical and ML-driven researches(Implicit and explicit).
However, a comprehensive evaluation of them is still lacking. In this paper, we
first present an in-depth analysis of those methods and find out their defects.
This is carried out on an extensive database composed of 660 samples of
hydraulic and channel properties worldwide. The reliability and
representativeness of utilized data are enhanced through the deployment of the
Subset Selection of Maximum Dissimilarity(SSMD) for testing set selection and
the Inter Quartile Range(IQR) for removal of the outlier. The evaluation
reveals the rank of those methods as: ML-driven method > the statistical method
> the analytical method. Whereas implicit ML-driven methods are black-boxes in
nature, explicit ML-driven methods have more potential in prediction of LDC.
Besides, overfitting is a universal problem in existing models. Those models
also suffer from a fixed parameter combination. To establish an interpretable
model for LDC prediction with higher performance, we then design a novel
symbolic regression method called evolutionary symbolic regression
network(ESRN). It is a combination of genetic algorithms and neural networks.
Strategies are introduced to avoid overfitting and explore more parameter
combinations. Results show that the ESRN model has superiorities over other
existing symbolic models in performance. The proposed model is suitable for
practical engineering problems due to its advantage in low requirement of
parameters (only w and U* are required). It can provide convincing solutions
for situations where the field test cannot be carried out or limited field
information can be obtained.

brief region where the probability is zero. At the point of highest probability
of extreme events, when the system is driven externally, we find that the
probability decreases to zero. Our investigation confirms that the external

characteristics like age, sex, working status etc. of each individual and other
factors influencing disease dynamics. Depending on number of epicentres of
infection, location of primary cases, sensitivity, proportion of asymptomatic
and frequency or duration of lockdown, our simulator tracks every individual
and hence infection progression through community over time.
  In a closed community of 10000 people, it is seen that without any lockdown,
number of cases peak around 6th week and wanes off around 15th week. If primary
case is located inside dense population cluster like slums, cases peak early
and wane off slowly. With introduction of lockdown, cases peak at slower rate.
If sensitivity of identifying infection decreases, cases and deaths increase.
Number of cases declines with increase in proportion of asymptomatic cases. The
model is robust and provides reproducible estimates with realistic parameter
values. It also guides in identifying measures to control outbreak in a

infectivity period, yield of testing, socio-economic strata, daily travel,
awareness level, population density, social distancing, lockdown etc. and can

material transfer functions which govern acoustic and elastic response. These
include wavenumber ($\kappa$) in such media and refractive index ($n$), density
($\boldsymbol{\rho}$) and its inverse, stiffness ($\boldsymbol{C}$) and
compliance ($\boldsymbol{D}$) tensors as well as the Bulk modulus ($B$), and
finally the broader generalization of these properties which is now known as
the Willis tensor ($\boldsymbol{L}$). Our goal is to clarify the appropriate
dispersion relations applicable to these properties from the perspective of
passivity. Under some mild assumptions, causality ensures that these properties
are analytical in the upper half but deriving dispersion relations for them
requires one to know how they behave in the limit $|\omega|\rightarrow\infty$.
Unlike electromagnetism, such a determination cannot be made on physical
grounds since in that limit the continuum approximation breaks down. Instead,
we can exploit the properties of the Herglotz-Nevanlinna (H-N) functions along
with their tensorial counterparts which characterize the transfer functions of
certain passive systems and for which the appropriate dispersion relation is
known. Our aim, therefore, is to clarify the relationship that these transfer
functions have with Herglotz functions, which in turn determines the
appropriate dispersion relation for them. Our analysis shows that based upon
passivity alone, dispersion relations of \emph{minimum} order 1 apply to the
Fourier transforms of $\boldsymbol{D},\boldsymbol{\rho}, n'$, and the inverse
of $B$, order 3 apply to $\boldsymbol{C},B$, and the inverse of
$\boldsymbol{\rho}$, and order 2 applies to $\kappa$.

  (ref: JPROCONT-D-21-00332)",,,,"stat.AP cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Data pre-treatment plays a significant role in improving data quality, thus
allowing extraction of accurate information from raw data. One of the data
pre-treatment techniques commonly used is outliers detection. The so-called
3${\sigma}$ method is a common practice to identify the outliers. As shown in
the manuscript, it does not identify all outliers, resulting in possible
distortion of the overall statistics of the data. This problem can have a
significant impact on further data analysis and can lead to reduction in the
accuracy of predictive models. There is a plethora of various techniques for
outliers detection, however, aside from theoretical work, they all require case
study work. Two types of outliers were considered: short-term (erroneous data,
noise) and long-term outliers (e.g. malfunctioning for longer periods). The
data used were taken from the vacuum distillation unit (VDU) of an Asian
refinery and included 40 physical sensors (temperature, pressure and flow
rate). We used a modified method for 3${\sigma}$ thresholds to identify the
short-term outliers, i.e. ensors data are divided into chunks determined by
change points and 3${\sigma}$ thresholds are calculated within each chunk
representing near-normal distribution. We have shown that piecewise 3${\sigma}$
method offers a better approach to short-term outliers detection than
3${\sigma}$ method applied to the entire time series. Nevertheless, this does
not perform well for long-term outliers (which can represent another state in
the data). In this case, we used principal component analysis (PCA) with
Hotelling's $T^2$ statistics to identify the long-term outliers. The results
obtained with PCA were subject to DBSCAN clustering method. The outliers (which
were visually obvious and correctly detected by the PCA method) were also
correctly identified by DBSCAN which supported the consistency and accuracy of
the PCA method.

  Changes",,,,,"cs.CR cs.CY cs.LG stat.AP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Voter eligibility in United States elections is determined by a patchwork of
state databases containing information about which citizens are eligible to
vote. Administrators at the state and local level are faced with the
exceedingly difficult task of ensuring that each of their jurisdictions is
properly managed, while also monitoring for improper modifications to the
database. Monitoring changes to Voter Registration Files (VRFs) is crucial,
given that a malicious actor wishing to disrupt the democratic process in the
US would be well-advised to manipulate the contents of these files in order to
achieve their goals. In 2020, we saw election officials perform admirably when
faced with administering one of the most contentious elections in US history,
but much work remains to secure and monitor the election systems Americans rely
on. Using data created by comparing snapshots taken of VRFs over time, we
present a set of methods that make use of machine learning to ease the burden
on analysts and administrators in protecting voter rolls. We first evaluate the
effectiveness of multiple unsupervised anomaly detection methods in detecting
VRF modifications by modeling anomalous changes as sparse additive noise. In
this setting we determine that statistical models comparing administrative
districts within a short time span and non-negative matrix factorization are
most effective for surfacing anomalous events for review. These methods were
deployed during 2019-2020 in our organization's monitoring system and were used
in collaboration with the office of the Iowa Secretary of State. Additionally,
we propose a newly deployed model which uses historical and demographic
metadata to label the likely root cause of database modifications. We hope to
use this model to predict which modifications have known causes and therefore
better identify potentially anomalous modifications.

  Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction?","This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

  longer be accessible",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  We consider the problem of predicting the future path of a pedestrian using
its motion history and the motion history of the surrounding pedestrians,
called social information. Since the seminal paper on Social-LSTM,
deep-learning has become the main tool used to model the impact of social
interactions on a pedestrian's motion. The demonstration that these models can
learn social interactions relies on an ablative study of these models. The
models are compared with and without their social interactions module on two
standard metrics, the Average Displacement Error and Final Displacement Error.
Yet, these complex models were recently outperformed by a simple
constant-velocity approach. This questions if they actually allow to model
social interactions as well as the validity of the proof. In this paper, we
focus on the deep-learning models with a soft-attention mechanism for social
interaction modeling and study whether they use social information at
prediction time. We conduct two experiments across four state-of-the-art
approaches on the ETH and UCY datasets, which were also used in previous work.
First, the models are trained by replacing the social information with random
noise and compared to model trained with actual social information. Second, we
use a gating mechanism along with a $L_0$ penalty, allowing models to shut down
their inner components. The models consistently learn to prune their
soft-attention mechanism. For both experiments, neither the course of the
convergence nor the prediction performance were altered. This demonstrates that
the soft-attention mechanism and therefore the social information are ignored
by the models.

of papers have been studying active learning (AL) for deep models. However,
there are a number of issues in the prevalent experimental settings, mainly
stemming from a lack of unified implementation and benchmarking. Issues in the
current literature include sometimes contradictory observations on the
performance of different AL algorithms, unintended exclusion of important
generalization approaches such as data augmentation and SGD for optimization, a
lack of study of evaluation facets like the labeling efficiency of AL, and
little or no clarity on the scenarios in which AL outperforms random sampling
(RS). In this work, we present a unified re-implementation of state-of-the-art
AL algorithms in the context of image classification via our new open-source AL
toolkit DISTIL, and we carefully study these issues as facets of effective
evaluation. On the positive side, we show that AL techniques are $2\times$ to
$4\times$ more label-efficient compared to RS with the use of data
augmentation. Surprisingly, when data augmentation is included, there is no
longer a consistent gain in using BADGE, a state-of-the-art approach, over
simple uncertainty sampling. We then do a careful analysis of how existing
approaches perform with varying amounts of redundancy and number of examples
per class. Finally, we provide several insights for AL practitioners to
consider in future work, such as the effect of the AL batch size, the effect of
initialization, the importance of retraining the model at every round, and
other insights.

  generation from 2D images",,,,,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  3D model generation from single 2D RGB images is a challenging and actively
researched computer vision task. Various techniques using conventional network
architectures have been proposed for the same. However, the body of research
work is limited and there are various issues like using inefficient 3D
representation formats, weak 3D model generation backbones, inability to
generate dense point clouds, dependence of post-processing for generation of
dense point clouds, and dependence on silhouettes in RGB images. In this paper,
a novel 2D RGB image to point cloud conversion technique is proposed, which
improves the state of art in the field due to its efficient, robust and simple
model by using the concept of parallelization in network architecture. It not
only uses the efficient and rich 3D representation of point clouds, but also
uses a novel and robust point cloud generation backbone in order to address the
prevalent issues. This involves using a single-encoder multiple-decoder deep
network architecture wherein each decoder generates certain fixed viewpoints.
This is followed by fusing all the viewpoints to generate a dense point cloud.
Various experiments are conducted on the technique and its performance is
compared with those of other state of the art techniques and impressive gains
in performance are demonstrated. Code is available at
