discipline, fueled by a surge in computing power and devices that enable the
creation, collection, storage and transfer of an increasingly complex (and
large) amount of data, such as remotely sensed imagery from a multitude of
sources. In this paper, we pose the preliminary question if this increasing
availability of information actually needs new computerized techniques, and
Artificial Intelligence methods, to make new and deeper understanding into
archaeological problems. Simply said, while it is a fact that Deep Learning
(DL) has become prevalent as a type of machine learning design inspired by the
way humans learn, and utilized to perform automatic actions people might
describe as intelligent, we want to anticipate, here, a discussion around the
subject whether machines, trained following this procedure, can extrapolate,
from archaeological data, concepts and meaning in the same way that humans
would do. Even prior to getting to technical results, we will start our
reflection with a very basic concept: Is a collection of satellite images with
notable archaeological sites informative enough to instruct a DL machine to
discover new archaeological sites, as well as other potential locations of
interest? Further, what if similar results could be reached with less
intelligent machines that learn by having people manually program them with
rules? Finally: If with barrier of meaning we refer to the extent to which
human-like understanding can be achieved by a machine, where should be posed
that barrier in the archaeological data science?

this, we present the main practically relevant segments of the theory with

robust link between an experimental measurement and a computational result. We
clarify the role of symmetry, and discuss cases where symmetry number

corrections as classically presented are a source of confusion, and could be
advantageously replaced by restraint free energy contributions. We establish
that contrary to a common intuition, partial or missing sampling of some modes
of symmetric bound states does not affect the calculated decoupling free
energies. Finally, we review these questions and pitfalls in the context of a
few common practical situations: binding to a symmetric receptor (equivalent
binding sites), binding of a symmetric ligand (equivalent poses), and formation
of a symmetric complex, in the case of homodimerization.

the origin of mass, it may not in fact be the origin of Yukawa couplings. In
alternative models, Yukawa couplings may instead arise from a seesaw type
mechanism involving the mixing of Standard Model (SM) chiral fermions with new
vector-like fermions, controlled by the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of a new
complex Higgs singlet field $\langle \Phi \rangle$. For example, the largest
third family $(t,b)$ quark Yukawa couplings may be forbidden by a $U(1)'$ gauge
or global symmetry, broken by $\langle \Phi \rangle$, and generated effectively
via mixing with a vector-like fourth family quark doublet $(T,B)$. Such
theories predict a new physical Higgs singlet $\phi$, which we refer to as the
Yukon, resulting from $\langle \Phi \rangle$, in the same way that the Higgs
boson $h^0$ results from $\langle H\rangle$. In a simplified model we discuss
the prospects for discovering the Yukon $\phi$ in gluon-gluon fusion
production, with $(t,b)$ and $(T,B)$ quarks in the loops, and decaying in the
channels $\phi\rightarrow \gamma\gamma, Z\gamma$ and $\phi\rightarrow
tT\rightarrow tth^0,ttZ$. The potential for discovery of the Yukon $\phi$ is
studied at present or future hadron colliders such as the LHC (Run 3), HL-LHC,
HE-LHC and/or FCC. For example, we find that a 300-350 GeV Yukon $\phi$ could
be accessed at LHC Run 3 in the di-photon channel in the global model,
providing a smoking gun signature of the origin of Yukawa couplings. The
$tth^0,ttZ$ channels are more involved and warrant a more sophisticated
analysis.

(TES) are individually coupled to superconducting LC filters and AC biased at
MHz frequencies through a common readout line. To make efficient use of the
available readout bandwidth and to minimize the effect of non-linearities, the
LC resonators are usually designed to be on a regular grid. The lithographic
processes however pose a limit on the accuracy of the effective filter
resonance frequencies. Off-resonance bias carriers could be used to suppress
the impact of intermodulation distortions, which nonetheless would
significantly affect the effective bias circuit and the detector spectral
performance. In this paper we present a frequency shift algorithm (FSA) to
allow off-resonance readout of TES's while preserving the on-resonance bias
circuit and spectral performance, demonstrating its application to the FDM
readout of a X-ray TES microcalorimeter array. We discuss the benefits in terms
of mitigation of the impact of intermodulation distortions at the cost of
increased bias voltage and the scalability of the algorithm to multi-pixel FDM
readout. We show that with FSA, in multi-pixel and frequencies shifted on-grid,
the line noises due to intermodulation distortion are placed away from the
sensitive region in the TES response and the X-ray performance is consistent
with the single-pixel, on-resonance level.

all angular scales. Previous studies show the angular power spectrum
$(C_{\ell})$ of the radio emission to be a broken power law, consistent with
MHD turbulence. The break has been identified with the transition from 2D to 3D
turbulence at the angular scale corresponding to the shell thickness.
Alternatively, this can also be explained as 2D inverse cascade driven by
energy injection from knot-shock interactions. Here we present $C_{\ell}$
measured from archival VLA $5$GHz (C band) data, and Chandra X-ray data in the
energy ranges ${\rm A}=0.6-1.0 \, \, {\rm keV}$ and ${\rm B} =4.2-6.0 \, \,
{\rm keV}$, both of which are continuum dominated. The different emissions all
trace fluctuations in the underlying plasma and possibly also the magnetic
field, and we expect them to be correlated. We quantify this using the cross
$C_{\ell}$ between the different emissions. We find that X-ray B is strongly
correlated with both radio and X-ray A, however X-ray A is only very weakly
correlated with radio. This supports a picture where X-ray A is predominantly
thermal bremsstrahlung whereas X-ray B is a composite of thermal bremsstrahlung
and non-thermal synchrotron emission. The various $C_{\ell}$ measured here, all
show a broken power law behaviour. However, the slopes are typically shallower
than those in radio and the position of the break also corresponds to smaller
angular scales. These findings provide observational inputs regarding the
nature of turbulence and the emission mechanisms in Cas A.

crucial to avoid fatalities. Pneumothorax is typically detected on a chest
X-ray image through visual inspection by experienced radiologists. However, the
detection rate is quite low. Therefore, there is a strong need for automated
detection systems to assist radiologists. Despite the high accuracy levels
generally reported for deep learning classifiers in many applications, they may
not be useful in clinical practice due to the lack of large number of
high-quality labelled images as well as a lack of interpretation possibility.
Alternatively, searching in the archive of past cases to find matching images
may serve as a 'virtual second opinion' through accessing the metadata of
matched evidently diagnosed cases. To use image search as a triaging/diagnosis
tool, all chest X-ray images must first be tagged with identifiers, i.e., deep
features. Then, given a query chest X-ray image, the majority vote among the
top k retrieved images can provide a more explainable output. While image
search can be clinically more viable, its detection performance needs to be
investigated at a scale closer to real-world practice. We combined 3 public
datasets to assemble a repository with more than 550,000 chest X-ray images. We
developed the Autoencoding Thorax Net (short AutoThorax-Net) for image search
in chest radiographs compressing three inputs: the left chest side, the flipped
right side, and the entire chest image. Experimental results show that image
search based on AutoThorax-Net features can achieve high identification rates
providing a path towards real-world deployment. We achieved 92% AUC accuracy
for a semi-automated search in 194,608 images (pneumothorax and normal) and 82%

that deep-learning-based image reconstruction methods are sensitive to

may be sensitive to small, yet adversarially-selected perturbations, (ii) may

existing road infrastructure into a highly dynamical and interconnected
Cyber-physical System (CPS). Though many different sensor systems have been
proposed in recent years, these solutions can only meet a subset of
requirements, including cost-efficiency, robustness, accuracy, and privacy
preservation. This paper provides a modular system approach that exploits radio
tomography in terms of attenuation patterns and highly accurate channel
information for reliable and robust detection and classification of different
road users. Hereto, we use Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) and
Ultra-Wideband (UWB) transceiver modules providing either Channel State
Information (CSI) or Channel Impulse Response (CIR) data. Since the proposed
system utilizes off-the-shelf and power-efficient embedded systems, it allows
for a cost-efficient ad-hoc deployment in existing road infrastructures. We
have evaluated the proposed system's performance for cyclists and other
motorized vehicles with an experimental live deployment. In this concern, the
primary focus has been on the accurate detection of cyclists on a bicycle path.
However, we also have conducted preliminary evaluation tests measuring
different motorized vehicles using a similar system configuration as for the
cyclists. In summary, the system achieves up to 100% accuracy for detecting
cyclists and more than 98% classifying cyclists and cars.

SWAGAN incorporates wavelets throughout its generator and discriminator

demonstrate the advantage of our method by integrating it into the SyleGAN2

higher quality images with more realistic high-frequency content. Furthermore,
we verify that our model's latent space retains the qualities that allow
StyleGAN to serve as a basis for a multitude of editing tasks, and show that
our frequency-aware approach also induces improved downstream visual quality.

cumulative learning, and federated learning. We have applied the metamodel to
problems ranging from time series analysis, computer vision, and natural

projects to fund based on residents' votes. Many cities use participatory
budgeting at a district level. Typically, a budget is divided among districts
proportionally to their population, and each district holds an election over
local projects and then uses its budget to fund the projects most preferred by
its voters. However, district-level participatory budgeting can yield poor
social welfare because it does not necessarily fund projects supported across
multiple districts. On the other hand, decision making that only takes global
social welfare into account can be unfair to districts: A
social-welfare-maximizing solution might not fund any of the projects preferred
by a district, despite the fact that its constituents pay taxes to the city.
Thus, we study how to fairly maximize social welfare in a participatory
budgeting setting with a single city-wide election. We propose a notion of
fairness that guarantees each district at least as much welfare as it would
have received in a district-level election. We show that, although optimizing
social welfare subject to this notion of fairness is NP-hard, we can
efficiently construct a lottery over welfare-optimal outcomes that is fair in
expectation. Moreover, we show that, when we are allowed to slightly relax
fairness, we can efficiently compute a fair solution that is
welfare-maximizing, but which may overspend the budget.

the host halo given by the splashback radius. Most importantly, we show that
the white noise-like feature that appears in the zero-momentum limit of the

stored forever as a digital version, yet the scanned photos are not restored
well. One solution is to train a supervised deep neural network on many digital
photos and the corresponding scanned photos. However, it requires a high labor
cost, leading to limited training data. Previous works create training pairs by
simulating degradation using image processing techniques. Their synthetic
images are formed with perfectly scanned photos in latent space. Even so, the
real-world degradation in smartphone photo scanning remains unsolved since it
is more complicated due to lens defocus, lighting conditions, losing details
via printing. Besides, locally structural misalignment still occurs in data due
to distorted shapes captured in a 3-D world, reducing restoration performance
and the reliability of the quantitative evaluation. To solve these problems, we
propose a semi-supervised Deep Photo Scan (DPScan). First, we present a way of
producing real-world degradation and provide the DIV2K-SCAN dataset for
smartphone-scanned photo restoration. Also, Local Alignment is proposed to
reduce the minor misalignment remaining in data. Second, we simulate many
different variants of the real-world degradation using low-level image
transformation to gain a generalization in smartphone-scanned image properties,
then train a degradation network to generalize all styles of degradation and
provide pseudo-scanned photos for unscanned images as if they were scanned by a
smartphone. Finally, we propose a Semi-Supervised Learning that allows our
restoration network to be trained on both scanned and unscanned images,
diversifying training image content. As a result, the proposed DPScan
quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms its baseline architecture,
state-of-the-art academic research, and industrial products in smartphone photo
scanning.

trajectories that can be inverted to yield an identity mapping between initial

is shown to be thermodynamically consistent and can be extremely useful in
simulation. We justify that it is the thermodynamic average of the internal

from the exchange microwork with the vacuum, which vanishes. We also establish
that the microwork is nonnegative for free expansion, which is remarkable,

error rates only decrease with system size when physical errors are
sufficiently uncorrelated. During computation, unused high energy levels of the
qubits can become excited, creating leakage states that are long-lived and
mobile. Particularly for superconducting transmon qubits, this leakage opens a
path to errors that are correlated in space and time. Here, we report a reset
protocol that returns a qubit to the ground state from all relevant higher
level states. We test its performance with the bit-flip stabilizer code, a
simplified version of the surface code for quantum error correction. We
investigate the accumulation and dynamics of leakage during error correction.
Using this protocol, we find lower rates of logical errors and an improved
scaling and stability of error suppression with increasing qubit number. This
demonstration provides a key step on the path towards scalable quantum

sufficiently low logical error rates. Many applications call for error rates in
the $10^{-15}$ regime, but state-of-the-art quantum platforms typically have
physical error rates near $10^{-3}$. Quantum error correction (QEC) promises to
bridge this divide by distributing quantum logical information across many
physical qubits so that errors can be detected and corrected. Logical errors
are then exponentially suppressed as the number of physical qubits grows,
provided that the physical error rates are below a certain threshold. QEC also
requires that the errors are local and that performance is maintained over many
rounds of error correction, two major outstanding experimental challenges.
Here, we implement 1D repetition codes embedded in a 2D grid of superconducting
qubits which demonstrate exponential suppression of bit or phase-flip errors,
reducing logical error per round by more than $100\times$ when increasing the
number of qubits from 5 to 21. Crucially, this error suppression is stable over
50 rounds of error correction. We also introduce a method for analyzing error
correlations with high precision, and characterize the locality of errors in a
device performing QEC for the first time. Finally, we perform error detection
using a small 2D surface code logical qubit on the same device, and show that
the results from both 1D and 2D codes agree with numerical simulations using a
simple depolarizing error model. These findings demonstrate that
superconducting qubits are on a viable path towards fault tolerant quantum

Allowable sequences are then the sweep oriented matroids of rank 2, and many of

oriented matroids and both modular hyperplanes and Dilworth truncations from

generalized Baues problem for cellular strings, where sweep oriented matroids
can play the role of monotone path polytopes, even for non-realizable oriented
matroids. In particular, we show that for oriented matroids that admit a sweep
oriented matroid, their poset of pseudo-sweeps deformation retracts to a sphere
of the appropriate dimension.

(FRBs) poses a challenge to the oft-studied magnetar scenarios. However, models
that postulate that FRBs result from magnetized shocks or magnetic reconnection
in a relativistic outflow are not specific to magnetar engines; instead, they
require only the impulsive injection of relativistic energy into a dense
magnetized medium. Motivated thus, we outline a new scenario in which FRBs are
powered by short-lived relativistic outflows (``flares'') from accreting black
holes or neutron stars, which propagate into the cavity of the pre-existing
(``quiescent'') jet. In order to reproduce FRB luminosities and rates, we are
driven to consider binaries of stellar-mass compact objects undergoing
super-Eddington mass-transfer, similar to ultraluminous X-ray (ULX) sources.
Indeed, the host galaxies of FRBs, and their spatial offsets within their
hosts, show broad similarities with ULXs. Periodicity on timescales of days to
years could be attributed to precession (e.g., Lens-Thirring) of the polar
accretion funnel, along which the FRB emission is geometrically and
relativistically beamed, which sweeps across the observer line of sight.
Accounting for the most luminous FRBs via accretion power may require a
population of binaries undergoing brief-lived phases of unstable
(dynamical-timescale) mass-transfer. This will lead to secular evolution in the
properties of some repeating FRBs on timescales of months to years, followed by
a transient optical/IR counterpart akin to a luminous red nova, or a more
luminous accretion-powered optical/X-ray transient. We encourage targeted FRB
searches of known ULX sources.

obtaining nanometer resolved optical properties using electron spectroscopy,

cathodoluminescence (CL) for emission, which were directly correlated to
chemical and structural information. In an h-BN/WS$_2$/h-BN heterostructure, we
observe local modulation of the trion (X$^{-}$) emission due to tens of

  To formalize such reasoning we extend Pauly's Coalition Logic with three new

for the new conditional strategic operators in concurrent game models,
introduce the matching notion of bisimulation for each of them, prove

the joint analysis with these data, we simulate a catalogue with standard siren

accuracy in a robust way. We find that the particular case, where $w = -1$ is
fixed on the DE nature, has a statistical preference for an interaction in the
dark sector at late times. In the general case, where $w(z)$ is analysed, we
find no evidence for such dark coupling, and the predictions are compatible
with the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. When the mock events of the standard sirens are
considered to improve the kernel in GP predictions, we find a preference for an

as it tackles simultaneous mapping of the unknown environment defined by
multiple landmark positions and localization of the unknown pose (i.e.,

SLAM problem is modeled on the Lie group of $\mathbb{SLAM}_{n}\left(3\right)$,

of angular velocities, translational velocities, landmarks, and inertial

surprising given their internal structure is radiative near the surface. A
direct probe of internal structure is pulsations, and some OB-type stars
exhibit pressure modes ($\beta$ Cep pulsators) or gravity modes (slowly
pulsating B-type stars; SPBs); a few rare cases of hybrid $\beta$ Cep/SPBs
occupy a narrow instability strip in the H-R diagram. The most precise
fundamental properties of stars are obtained from eclipsing binaries (EBs), and
those in clusters with known ages and metallicities provide the most stringent
constraints on theory. Here we report the discovery that HD 149834 in the
$\sim$5 Myr cluster NGC 6193 is an EB comprising a hybrid $\beta$ Cep/SPB
pulsator and a highly irradiated low-mass companion. We determine the masses,
radii, and temperatures of both stars; the $\sim$9.7 M$_\odot$ primary resides
in the instability strip where hybrid pulsations are theoretically predicted.
The presence of both SPB and $\beta$ Cep pulsations indicates that the system
has a near-solar metallicity, and is in the second half of the main-sequence
lifetime. The radius of the $\sim$1.2 M$_\odot$ companion is consistent with
theoretical pre-main-sequence isochrones at 5 Myr, but its temperature is much
higher than expected, perhaps due to irradiation by the primary. The radius of
the primary is larger than expected, unless its metallicity is super-solar.
Finally, the light curve shows residual modulation consistent with the rotation
of the primary, and Chandra observations reveal a flare, both of which suggest
the presence of starspots and thus magnetism on the primary.

studying strongly correlated unconventional superconductors. When the
superconducting gap functions with different pairing symmetries compete, an
Ising ($Z_2$) type symmetry breaking occurs due to the locking of the relative
phase $\Delta\theta_{12}$ via a second order Josephson coupling. The phase
locking can take place even in the normal state in the phase fluctuation regime
before the onset of superconductivity. If $\Delta\theta_{12}=\pm\frac{\pi}{2}$,
then TRS is broken, otherwise, if $\Delta\theta_{12}=0$, or, $\pi$, rotational
symmetry is broken leading to a nematic state. In both cases, the order
parameters possess a 4-fermion structure beyond the scope of mean-field theory.
We employ an effective two-component $XY$-model assisted by a renormalization
group analysis to address this problem. In addition, a quartetting, or,
charge-``4e"", superconductivity can also occur above $T_c$. Monte-Carlo
simulations are performed and the results are in a good agreement with the

machine learning techniques that uses a generative model to find naturally
occurring instances misclassified by a model. Further, we observe that the
generative models have regions in their latent space with higher concentrations
of misclassifications. We call these regions misclassification regions and find
they have several useful properties. Each region contains a specific type of
model bug; for instance, a misclassification region for an MNIST classifier
contains a style of skinny 6 that the model mistakes as a 1. We can also assign
a single label to each region, facilitating low-cost labeling. We propose a
method to learn the misclassification regions and use this insight to both
categorize errors and correct them. In practice, Defuse finds and corrects
novel errors in classifiers. For example, Defuse shows that a high-performance
traffic sign classifier mistakes certain 50km/h signs as 80km/h. Defuse
corrects the error after fine-tuning while maintaining generalization on the

If the simulation is biased by an external potential, the weight of the

energy as a simultaneous function of several collective variables starting from
data generated in a statically-biased simulation. The approach exploits the
property of a free energy estimator recently introduced by us which provides by
construction the estimate in a region of infinitely small size. We show that
this property allows removing the effect of the external bias in a simple and
rigorous manner. The approach is validated on model systems for which the free
energy is known analytically and on a small peptide for which the ground truth
free energy is estimated in an independent unbiased run. In both cases the free
energy obtained with our approach is an unbiased estimator of the ground-truth
free energy, with an error whose magnitude is also predicted by the model.

However, designing such an automated tool from non-invasive radiographic images

This article proposes a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based

recover automatically from partial failures by implementing Checkpoint and
Rollback Recovery. However, this is an expensive operation which impacts
negatively on the overall performance of the system and manually optimizing
fault tolerance for specific jobs is a difficult and time consuming task.
  In this paper we introduce Chiron, an approach for automatically optimizing
the frequency with which checkpoints are performed in streaming jobs. For any
chosen job, parallel profiling runs are performed, each containing a variant of
the configurations, with the resulting metrics used to model the impact of
checkpoint-based fault tolerance on performance and availability. Understanding

support the theory that the bulk of Earth's mass (>80%) most likely accreted
within 10-30 Myr. From a combined analysis of the before mentioned isotopes,
one finds that proto-Earth accreted 0.5-0.6 MEarth within the first ~4-5 Myr,
the approximate lifetime of the protoplanetary disk. For Venus, the available
atmospheric noble gas data are too uncertain for constraining the planet's
accretion scenario accurately. However, from the available Ar and Ne isotope
measurements, one finds that proto-Venus could have grown to 0.85-1.0 MVenus
before the disk dissipated. Classical terrestrial planet formation models have
struggled to grow large planetary embryos quickly from the tiniest materials
within the typical lifetime of protoplanetary disks. Pebble accretion could
solve this long-standing time scale controversy. Pebble accretion and streaming
instabilities produce large planetesimals that grow into Mars-sized and larger
planetary embryos during this early accretion phase. The later stage of
accretion can be explained well with the Grand-Tack, annulus or depleted disk

  Sampling","12 pages, 5 figures, 11 tables. - Happy Chinese New Year!",,,,"cs.CV cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The canonical approach to video-and-language learning (e.g., video question
answering) dictates a neural model to learn from offline-extracted dense video
features from vision models and text features from language models. These
feature extractors are trained independently and usually on tasks different
from the target domains, rendering these fixed features sub-optimal for
downstream tasks. Moreover, due to the high computational overload of dense
video features, it is often difficult (or infeasible) to plug feature
extractors directly into existing approaches for easy finetuning. To provide a
remedy to this dilemma, we propose a generic framework ClipBERT that enables
affordable end-to-end learning for video-and-language tasks, by employing
sparse sampling, where only a single or a few sparsely sampled short clips from
a video are used at each training step. Experiments on text-to-video retrieval
and video question answering on six datasets demonstrate that ClipBERT
outperforms (or is on par with) existing methods that exploit full-length
videos, suggesting that end-to-end learning with just a few sparsely sampled
clips is often more accurate than using densely extracted offline features from
full-length videos, proving the proverbial less-is-more principle. Videos in
the datasets are from considerably different domains and lengths, ranging from
3-second generic domain GIF videos to 180-second YouTube human activity videos,
showing the generalization ability of our approach. Comprehensive ablation
studies and thorough analyses are provided to dissect what factors lead to this
success. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/jayleicn/ClipBERT

significance, this problem remains rather unexplored, with a few exceptions
that considered unsupervised semantic segmentation on small-scale datasets with
a narrow visual domain. In this paper, we make a first attempt to tackle the
problem on datasets that have been traditionally utilized for the supervised
case. To achieve this, we introduce a two-step framework that adopts a
predetermined mid-level prior in a contrastive optimization objective to learn
pixel embeddings. This marks a large deviation from existing works that relied
on proxy tasks or end-to-end clustering. Additionally, we argue about the
importance of having a prior that contains information about objects, or their

unsupervised manner.
  Experimental evaluation shows that our method comes with key advantages over
existing works. First, the learned pixel embeddings can be directly clustered
in semantic groups using K-Means on PASCAL. Under the fully unsupervised
setting, there is no precedent in solving the semantic segmentation task on
such a challenging benchmark. Second, our representations can improve over
strong baselines when transferred to new datasets, e.g. COCO and DAVIS. The

non-classical features of quantum states. Beyond its fundamental relevance, it
is also a necessary resource for quantum speedup with continuous variables. As
quantum technologies emerge, the need to identify and characterize the
resources which provide an advantage over existing classical technologies
becomes more pressing. Here we derive witnesses for Wigner negativity of
single-mode and multimode quantum states, based on fidelities with Fock states,
which can be reliably measured using standard detection setups. They possess a
threshold expectation value indicating whether the measured state has a
negative Wigner function. Moreover, the amount of violation provides an
operational quantification of Wigner negativity. We phrase the problem of
finding the threshold values for our witnesses as an infinite-dimensional
linear optimisation problem. By relaxing and restricting the corresponding
linear programs, we derive two converging hierarchies of semidefinite programs,
which provide numerical sequences of increasingly tighter upper and lower
bounds for the threshold values. We further show that our witnesses form a
complete family - each Wigner negative state is detected by at least one
witness - thus providing a reliable method for experimentally witnessing Wigner
negativity of quantum states from few measurements. From a foundational
perspective, our findings provide insights on the set of positive Wigner
functions which still lacks a proper characterisation.

conformal prediction, a methodology that augments predictive models to return
prediction sets that provide uncertainty quantification -- they provably cover
the true response with a user-specified probability, such as 90%. One might
hope that when used with privately-trained models, conformal prediction would
yield privacy guarantees for the resulting prediction sets; unfortunately this
is not the case. To remedy this key problem, we develop a method that takes any
pre-trained predictive model and outputs differentially private prediction
sets. Our method follows the general approach of split conformal prediction; we
use holdout data to calibrate the size of the prediction sets but preserve
privacy by using a privatized quantile subroutine. This subroutine compensates
for the noise introduced to preserve privacy in order to guarantee correct
coverage. We evaluate the method on large-scale computer vision datasets.

especially in the unsupervised scenario. The dominating paradigm of
unsupervised disentanglement is currently to train a generative model that
separates different factors of variation in its latent space. This separation
is typically enforced by training with specific regularization terms in the
model's objective function. These terms, however, introduce additional
hyperparameters responsible for the trade-off between disentanglement and
generation quality. While tuning these hyperparameters is crucial for proper
disentanglement, it is often unclear how to tune them without external

  This paper investigates an alternative route to disentangled representations.
Namely, we propose to extract such representations from the state-of-the-art
generative models trained without disentangling terms in their objectives. This
paradigm of post hoc disentanglement employs little or no hyperparameters when
learning representations while achieving results on par with existing
state-of-the-art, as shown by comparison in terms of established

abundances of [O/H], [Fe/H], and [N/H] in 11 Milky Way (MW) and M31-mass
galaxies across their formation histories at $z \leq 1.5$ ($t_{\rm lookback}
\leq 9.4$ Gyr), motivated by characterizing the initial conditions of stars for
chemical tagging. Gas within $1$ kpc of the disk midplane is vertically
homogeneous to $\lesssim 0.008$ dex at all $z \leq 1.5$. We find negative
radial gradients (metallicity decreases with galactocentric radius) at all
times, which steepen over time from $\approx -0.01$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ at $z = 1$
($t_{\rm lookback} = 7.8$ Gyr) to $\approx -0.03$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ at $z = 0$,
and which broadly agree with observations of the MW, M31, and nearby
MW/M31-mass galaxies. Azimuthal variations at fixed radius are typically $0.14$
dex at $z = 1$, reducing to $0.05$ dex at $z = 0$. Thus, over time radial
gradients become steeper while azimuthal variations become weaker (more
homogeneous). As a result, azimuthal variations were larger than radial
variations at $z \gtrsim 0.8$ ($t_{\rm lookback} \gtrsim 6.9$ Gyr).
Furthermore, elemental abundances are measurably homogeneous (to $\lesssim
0.05$ dex) across a radial range of $\Delta R \approx 3.5$ kpc at $z \gtrsim 1$
and $\Delta R \approx 1.7$ kpc at $z = 0$. We also measure full distributions
of elemental abundances, finding typically negatively skewed normal
distributions at $z \gtrsim 1$ that evolve to typically Gaussian distributions
by $z = 0$. Our results on gas abundances inform the initial conditions for
stars, including the spatial and temporal scales for applying chemical tagging
to understand stellar birth in the MW.

generative model that captures meaningful features from the given
$n$-dimensional continuous data. The difficulties associated with learning
GB-RBM are reported extensively in earlier studies. They indicate that the
training of the GB-RBM using the current standard algorithms, namely,
contrastive divergence (CD) and persistent contrastive divergence (PCD), needs
a carefully chosen small learning rate to avoid divergence which, in turn,
results in slow learning. In this work, we alleviate such difficulties by
showing that the negative log-likelihood for a GB-RBM can be expressed as a
difference of convex functions if we keep the variance of the conditional
distribution of visible units (given hidden unit states) and the biases of the
visible units, constant. Using this, we propose a stochastic {\em difference of
convex functions} (DC) programming (S-DCP) algorithm for learning the GB-RBM.
We present extensive empirical studies on several benchmark datasets to
validate the performance of this S-DCP algorithm. It is seen that S-DCP is
better than the CD and PCD algorithms in terms of speed of learning and the
quality of the generative model learnt.

because of the increased computational power and increased research in

agent consisting of a Latent Feature State Space(LFSS) Module for filtering and
feature extraction of financial data which is used as a state space for deep RL
model. We develop an extensive RL agent with high efficiency and performance

The noisy and non-stationary behaviour of daily asset prices in the financial
market is addressed through Kalman Filter. Autoencoders, ZoomSVD, and
restricted Boltzmann machines were the models used and compared in the module
to extract relevant time series features as state space. We simulate weekly

policy iteration (API). While standard API often performs poorly, it has been
shown that learning can be stabilized by regularizing each policy update by the
KL-divergence to the previous policy. Popular practical algorithms such as
TRPO, MPO, and VMPO replace regularization by a constraint on KL-divergence of
consecutive policies, arguing that this is easier to implement and tune. In
this work, we study this implementation choice in more detail. We compare the
use of KL divergence as a constraint vs. as a regularizer, and point out
several optimization issues with the widely-used constrained approach. We show
that the constrained algorithm is not guaranteed to converge even on simple
problem instances where the constrained problem can be solved exactly, and in
fact incurs linear expected regret. With approximate implementation using
softmax policies, we show that regularization can improve the optimization
landscape of the original objective. We demonstrate these issues empirically on

order to better perceive the environment being interacted with, there is
greater sensitivity to errors in calibration of the base-to-camera transform. A
secondary source of uncertainty during robotic control are inaccuracies in
joint angle measurements which can be caused by biases in positioning and
complex transmission effects such as backlash and cable stretch. In this work,
we bring together these two sets of unknown parameters into a unified problem
formulation when the kinematic chain is partially visible in the camera view.
We prove that these parameters are non-identifiable implying that explicit
estimation of them is infeasible. To overcome this, we derive a smaller set of
parameters we call Lumped Error since it lumps together the errors of
calibration and joint angle measurements. A particle filter method is presented

sufficiently well-explored in prior work. With end-to-end models, one could
choose to preprocess the input speech using speech enhancement techniques and
train the model using enhanced speech. Another alternative is to pass the noisy
speech as input and modify the model architecture to adapt to noisy speech. A
systematic comparison of these two approaches for end-to-end robust ASR has not
been attempted before. We address this gap and present a detailed comparison of
speech enhancement-based techniques and three different model-based adaptation
techniques covering data augmentation, multi-task learning, and adversarial
learning for robust ASR. While adversarial learning is the best-performing
technique on certain noise types, it comes at the cost of degrading clean
speech WER. On other relatively stationary noise types, a new speech
enhancement technique outperformed all the model-based adaptation techniques.
This suggests that knowledge of the underlying noise type can meaningfully
inform the choice of adaptation technique.

rapidly-expanding pervasive and hyper-connected world. Robust security
protocols ensuring secure communication, device's resilience to attacks,
authentication control and users privacy need to be implemented. Random Number
Generators (RNGs) are the fundamental primitive in most secure protocols but,
often, also the weakest one. Establishing security in billions of devices
requires high quality random data generated at a sufficiently high throughput.
On the other hand, the RNG should exhibit a high integration level with on-chip
extraction to remove, in real time, potential imperfections. We present the
first integrated Quantum RNG (QRNG) in a standard CMOS technology node. The
QRNG is based on a parallel array of independent Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes
(SPADs), homogeneously illuminated by a DC-biased LED, and co-integrated logic
circuits for postprocessing. We describe the randomness generation process and
we prove the quantum origin of entropy. We show that co-integration of
combinational logic, even of high complexity, does not affect the quality of
randomness. Our CMOS QRNG can reach up to 400 Mbit/s throughput with low power
consumption. Thanks to the use of standard CMOS technology and a modular
architecture, our QRNG is suitable for a highly scalable solution.

Surface Force Tribometer (TF-SFT), which allows probing both the rheological
and the tribological properties of RTILs films confined between a millimetric
sphere and a surface, over a wide range of confinements. When the RTIL is
confined between metallic surfaces, we evidence an abrupt change of its
rheological properties below a threshold confinement. This is reminiscent of a
recently reported confinement induced capillary freezing, here observed with a
wide contact area. In parallel, we probe the tribological response of the film
under imposed nanometric shear deformation and unveil a yielding behaviour of
the interfacial solid phase below this threshold confinement. This is
characterized by a transition from an elastic to a plastic regime, exhibiting
striking similarities with the response of glassy materials. This transition to
yielding of the RTIL in metallic confinement leads overall to a reduction in
friction and offers a self-healing protection of the surfaces avoiding direct
contact, with obvious applications in tribology.

grafting density can be controlled by external stimuli. This is achieved by
using end-grafted polymer chains that have an affinity to the substrate. For
sufficiently strong surface interactions, a fraction of chains condenses into a
near-surface layer, while the remaining ones form the outer brush. The dense
layer and the more tenuous outer brush can be seen as coexisting microphases.
The effective grafting density of the outer brush is controlled by the
adsorption strength and can be changed reversibly and in a controlled way as a
response to changes in environmental parameters. The effect is demonstrated by
numerical SCF calculations and analyzed by scaling arguments. Since the
thickness of the denser layer is about a few monomer sizes, its capacity to
form a microphase is limited by the product of the brush chain length and the
grafting density. We explore the range of chain lengths and grafting densities
where the effect is most pronounced. In this range, the SCF studies suggest
that individual chains inside the brush show large rapid fluctuations between
two states that are separated by only a small free energy barrier. The behavior
of the brush as a whole, however, does not reflect these large fluctuations,
and the effective grafting density varies smoothly as a function of the control
parameters.

to forecast such a spatiotemporally chaotic system -- i.e. black hole weather
forecasting -- using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a training
dataset which consists of numerical solutions of the hydrodynamical equations,
for a range of initial conditions. We find that deep neural networks seem to
learn well black hole accretion physics and evolve the accretion flow orders of
magnitude faster than traditional numerical solvers, while maintaining a
reasonable accuracy for a long time. For instance, CNNs predict well the
temporal evolution of a RIAF over a long duration of $8\times 10^4 GM/c^3$,
which corresponds to 80 dynamical times at $r=100 GM/c^2$. The DL model is able
to evolve flows from initial conditions not present in the training dataset
with good accuracy. Our approach thus seems to generalize well. Once trained,
the DL model evolves a turbulent RIAF on a single GPU four orders of magnitude
faster than usual fluid dynamics integrators running in parallel on 200 CPU

implementations. The effective policy requires taking into account public
information and adaptability to new knowledge. Epidemiological models built to
understand COVID-19 seldom provide the policymaker with the capability for
adaptive pandemic control (APC). Among the core challenges to be overcome
include (a) inability to handle a high degree of non-homogeneity in different
contributing features across the pandemic timeline, (b) lack of an approach
that enables adaptive incorporation of public health expert knowledge, and (c)
transparent models that enable understanding of the decision-making process in
suggesting policy. In this work, we take the early steps to address these
challenges using Knowledge Infused Policy Gradient (KIPG) methods. Prior work
on knowledge infusion does not handle soft and hard imposition of varying forms
of knowledge in disease information and guidelines to necessarily comply with.
Furthermore, the models do not attend to non-homogeneity in feature counts,
manifesting as partial observability in informing the policy. Additionally,
interpretable structures are extracted post-learning instead of learning an
interpretable model required for APC. To this end, we introduce a mathematical
framework for KIPG methods that can (a) induce relevant feature counts over
multi-relational features of the world, (b) handle latent non-homogeneous
counts as hidden variables that are linear combinations of kernelized
aggregates over the features, and (b) infuse knowledge as functional
constraints in a principled manner. The study establishes a theory for imposing
hard and soft constraints and simulates it through experiments. In comparison
with knowledge-intensive baselines, we show quick sample efficient adaptation
to new knowledge and interpretability in the learned policy, especially in a
pandemic context.

sample of ALESS submillimeter galaxies from Hodge et al. (2016). We constrain
the physical scales over which the dust radiates and compare those measurements
to characteristics of the integrated SED. We confirm significant correlations
of $\lambda_{peak}$ with both L$_{IR}$ (or SFR) and $\Sigma_{\rm IR}$

$\log_{10}$($\lambda_{peak}$) and $\log_{10}$($\Sigma_{\rm IR}$) and find the
relation to hold as would be expected from the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, or the
effective size of an equivalent blackbody. The correlations of $\lambda_{peak}$
with sSFR and distance from the SFR-M$_\star$ relation are less significant
than those for $\Sigma_{\rm IR}$ or L$_{IR}$; therefore, we conclude that the

nowadays, and to assure the confidentiality and integrity of its control
messages, the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL)
incorporates three modes of security: the Unsecured Mode (UM), Preinstalled
Secure Mode (PSM), and the Authenticated Secure Mode (ASM). While the PSM and
ASM are intended to protect against external routing attacks and some replay
attacks (through an optional replay protection mechanism), recent research
showed that RPL in PSM is still vulnerable to many routing attacks, both
internal and external. In this paper, we propose a novel secure mode for RPL,
the Chained Secure Mode (CSM), based on the concept of intraflow Network Coding
(NC). The CSM is designed to enhance RPL resilience and mitigation capability
against replay attacks while allowing the integration with external security
measures such as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). The security and
performance of the proposed CSM were evaluated and compared against RPL in UM
and PSM (with and without the optional replay protection) under several routing
attacks: the Neighbor attack (NA), Wormhole (WH), and CloneID attack (CA),
using average packet delivery rate (PDR), End-to-End (E2E) latency, and power
consumption as metrics. It showed that CSM has better performance and more
enhanced security than both the UM and PSM with the replay protection, while
mitigating both the NA and WH attacks and significantly reducing the effect of
the CA in the investigated scenarios.

by associating to each compact Riemannian symmetric space, via
Marsden-Weinstein reduction, a generalized flag manifold which covers the space
parametrizing all of its maximal totally geodesic tori. In the process we
notice a direct relation between the Satake diagram of the symmetric space and
the painted Dynkin diagram of its associated flag manifold. We consider in
detail the examples of the classical simply-connected spaces of rank one and
the space SU(3)/SO(3). In the second part of the paper we provide a
construction of harmonic polynomials inducing Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions
on the symmetric space from holomorphic sections of the associated line bundle
on the generalized flag manifold. We show that in the examples we consider the
construction provides all of the eigenfunctions.

signal from the RVs, we found the lower bound on the lifetime of a previously
identified large spot group on the surface of the star to be at least 5.1
years. A $\sim5$ year lower limit is a long, but not unprecedented, duration
for a single spot group. The later epoch data indicate significant spot

years. We find that pre-main sequence evolutionary models for the age of Taurus
($\sim2$ Myr), combined with component mass estimates from the literature,
permit us to reproduce the HST relative photometry and the binary-induced
contribution to the apparent RV variations. The long-lived star spot we find on
Hubble 4 has significant implications for dynamo models in young stars, as it
adds evidence for long lifetimes of magnetic field topologies. There are also
significant implications for young star exoplanet searches as long-lived

at the front of a flare termination shock. Here we report another stochastic
spike burst event recorded during the extended energy release phase of a
long-duration M8.4-class eruptive flare on 2012 March 10. VLA radio
spectroscopic imaging of the spikes in 1.0--1.6 GHz shows that similar to the

of the flare from two vantage points with hard X-ray and ultraviolet
observations of the flare ribbon brightenings, we reconstruct the flare arcade
in three dimensions. The results show that the spike source is located at ~60
Mm above the flare arcade, where a diffuse supra-arcade fan and multitudes of
plasma downflows are present. Although the flare arcade and ribbons seen during
the impulsive phase do not allow us to clearly understand how the observed
spike source location is connected to the flare geometry, the cooling flare

Math. Theor., 52:445002, 2019] (1), where we show that in [Phys. Rev. B,
87:134201, 2013] the exponent $\nu$ has been obtained by applying a
mathematical relation in a regime where this relation is not valid. We observe
that the criticism above on the mathematical validity of such relation has not
been addressed in the comment. Our criticism thus remains valid, and disproves
the conclusions of the comment. This constitutes the main point of this reply.
  We also provide a point-by-point response and discussion of Angelini et al.'s
claims. First, Angelini et al. claim that the prediction $2^{1/\nu}=1$ of [1]
is incorrect, because it results from the relation $\lambda_{\rm
max}=2^{1/\nu}$ between the largest eigenvalue of the linearized
renormalization-group (RG) transformation and $\nu$, which cannot be applied to
the ensemble renormalization group (ERG) method, because for the ERG
$\lambda_{\rm max} =1 $. However, the feature $\lambda_{\rm max}=1$ is specific
to the ERG transformation and it does not give any grounds for questioning the
validity of the general relation $\lambda_{\rm max}=2^{1/\nu}$ specifically for
the ERG transformation. Second, Angelini et al. claim that $\nu$ should be
extracted from an early RG regime (A), as opposed to the asymptotic regime (B)
used to estimate $\nu$ in [1] and that (B) is dominated by finite-size effects.
Still, (A) is a small-wavelength, non-critical regime, which cannot
characterize the critical exponent $\nu$ related to the divergence of the
correlation length. Also, the fact that (B) involves finite-size effects is a
feature specific to the ERG, and gives no rationale for extracting $\nu$ from
(A).
  Finally, we refute the remaining claims made by Angelini et al., and thus
stand by our assertion that the ERG method yields a prediction given by
$2^{1/\nu}=1$.

problem formulation for fair redundant task allocation, which we cast as the
optimization of worst-case task costs under a cardinality constraint. Solving
this problem optimally is NP-hard. We exploit properties of supermodularity to
propose a polynomial-time, near-optimal solution. In supermodular redundant
assignment, the use of additional agents always improves task costs. Therefore,
we provide a solution set that is $\alpha$ times larger than the cardinality
constraint. This constraint relaxation enables our approach to achieve a
super-optimal cost by using a sub-optimal assignment size. We derive the
sub-optimality bound on this cardinality relaxation, $\alpha$. Additionally, we
demonstrate that our algorithm performs near-optimally without the cardinality
relaxation. We show simulations of redundant assignments of robots to goal
nodes on transport networks with uncertain travel times. Empirically, our
algorithm outperforms benchmarks, scales to large problems, and provides
improvements in both fairness and average utility.

problem emerges naturally in various applications such as social network
de-anonymization, image processing, DNA sequencing, and natural language
processing. A pair of randomly generated labeled Erdos-Renyi graphs with
pairwise correlated edges are considered. It is assumed that the matching
strategy has access to the labeling of the vertices in the first graph, as well
as a collection of shortlists -- called ambiguity sets -- of possible labels
for the vertices of the second graph. The objective is to leverage the
correlation among the edges of the graphs along with the side-information
provided in the form of ambiguity sets to recover the labels of the vertices in
the second graph. This scenario can be viewed as a generalization of the seeded
graph matching problem, where the ambiguity sets take a specific form such that
the exact labels for a subset of vertices in the second graph are known prior
to matching. A matching strategy is proposed which operates by evaluating the
joint typicality of the adjacency matrices of the graphs. Sufficient conditions
on the edge statistics as well as ambiguity set statistics are derived under
which the proposed matching strategy successfully recovers the labels of the

corroborates the successful solution-based synthesis of KH$_2$PO$_4$

observing not only the high-frequency internal modes ($\sim$900-1200

  Knowledge",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Selecting causal inference models for estimating individualized treatment
effects (ITE) from observational data presents a unique challenge since the
counterfactual outcomes are never observed. The problem is challenged further
in the unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) setting where we only have access
to labeled samples in the source domain, but desire selecting a model that
achieves good performance on a target domain for which only unlabeled samples
are available. Existing techniques for UDA model selection are designed for the
predictive setting. These methods examine discriminative density ratios between
the input covariates in the source and target domain and do not factor in the
model's predictions in the target domain. Because of this, two models with
identical performance on the source domain would receive the same risk score by
existing methods, but in reality, have significantly different performance in
the test domain. We leverage the invariance of causal structures across domains
to propose a novel model selection metric specifically designed for ITE methods
under the UDA setting. In particular, we propose selecting models whose
predictions of interventions' effects satisfy known causal structures in the
target domain. Experimentally, our method selects ITE models that are more
robust to covariate shifts on several healthcare datasets, including estimating
the effect of ventilation in COVID-19 patients from different geographic
locations.

to solve the stochastic optimal control problem behind the pricing and hedging

manipulation for precise, contact-rich tasks. In particular, we contribute a
framework for closed-loop robotic manipulation that automatically handles a
category of objects, despite potentially unseen object instances and
significant intra-category variations in shape, size and appearance. Previous
approaches typically build a feedback loop on top of a real-time 6-DOF pose
estimator. However, representing an object with a parameterized transformation
from a fixed geometric template does not capture large intra-category shape
variation. Hence we adopt the keypoint-based object representation proposed in
kPAM for category-level pick-and-place, and extend it to closed-loop
manipulation policies with contact-rich tasks. We first augment keypoints with
local orientation information. Using the oriented keypoints, we propose a novel
object-centric action representation in terms of regulating the linear/angular
velocity or force/torque of these oriented keypoints. This formulation is
surprisingly versatile -- we demonstrate that it can accomplish contact-rich
manipulation tasks that require precision and dexterity for a category of
objects with different shapes, sizes and appearances, such as peg-hole
insertion for pegs and holes with significant shape variation and tight
clearance. With the proposed object and action representation, our framework is
also agnostic to the robot grasp pose and initial object configuration, making

models, consensus-based distributed optimization methods have recently been
advocated as alternatives to the popular parameter server framework. In this
paradigm, each worker maintains a local estimate of the optimal parameter
vector, and iteratively updates it by waiting and averaging all estimates
obtained from its neighbors, and then corrects it on the basis of its local
dataset. However, the synchronization phase can be time consuming due to the
need to wait for \textit{stragglers}, i.e., slower workers. An efficient way to
mitigate this effect is to let each worker wait only for updates from the
fastest neighbors before updating its local parameter. The remaining neighbors
are called \textit{backup workers.} To minimize the globally training time over
the network, we propose a fully distributed algorithm to dynamically determine
the number of backup workers for each worker. We show that our algorithm
achieves a linear speedup for convergence (i.e., convergence performance
increases linearly with respect to the number of workers). We conduct extensive
experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 to verify our theoretical results.

Mixup, a popular yet simple data augmentation technique based on taking convex

However, when and how Mixup helps calibration is still a mystery. In this

comparison of estimated total dust masses measured for 259P in 2008 and 2017
shows no evidence of changes in activity strength between the two active
apparitions. The heliocentric distance of 259P's activity onset point is much
smaller than those of other MBCs, suggesting that its ice reservoirs may be
located at greater depths than on MBCs farther from the Sun, increasing the
time needed for a solar irradiation-driven thermal wave to reach subsurface
ice. We suggest that deeper ice on 259P could be a result of more rapid ice
depletion caused by the object's closer proximity to the Sun compared to other
MBCs.

some practical applications provide both audio and visual streams of input. In
these cases, the visual stream provides complementary information and can often
be leveraged in conjunction with the acoustics of speech to improve
verification performance. In this study, we explore audio-visual approaches to
speaker verification, starting with standard fusion techniques to learn joint
audio-visual (AV) embeddings, and then propose a novel approach to handle
cross-modal verification at test time. Specifically, we investigate unimodal
and concatenation based AV fusion and report the lowest AV equal error rate
(EER) of 0.7% on the VoxCeleb1 dataset using our best system. As these methods
lack the ability to do cross-modal verification, we introduce a multi-view
model which uses a shared classifier to map audio and video into the same
space. This new approach achieves 28% EER on VoxCeleb1 in the challenging
testing condition of cross-modal verification.

success/failure information from software executions, in conjunction with
statistical inference, to automatically score program elements based on how
likely they are to be faulty. SFL techniques typically employ one type of
profile data: either coverage data, predicate outcomes, or variable values.
Most SFL techniques actually measure correlation, not causation, between
profile values and success/failure, and so they are subject to confounding bias
that distorts the scores they produce. This paper presents a new SFL technique,
named \emph{UniVal}, that uses causal inference techniques and machine learning
to integrate information about both predicate outcomes and variable values to
more accurately estimate the true failure-causing effect of program statements.
\emph{UniVal} was empirically compared to several coverage-based,
predicate-based, and value-based SFL techniques on 800 program versions with

time through the system is short compared to time scales associated with the
magnetic field evolution. In particular, considering an idealized magnetic
configuration we show how trapping/detrapping of energetic magnetized electrons
can cause effective parallel velocity diffusion. This parallel diffusion,
combined with naturally occurring mechanisms known to cause pitch angle
scattering, such as Whistler waves, produces enhanced heating rates for
magnetic pumping. We find that at low pitch angle scattering rates the combined
mechanism enhances the heating beyond the predictions of the recent theory for
magnetic pumping with trapped electrons.

extremely metal-poor ($Z \leq 10^{-3}$ Zsun) gas, performing a suite of
three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations using the adaptive mesh refinement
code Enzo. We systematically follow the long-term evolution for 2000 years
after the first protostar's birth, for the cases of $Z = 0$, $10^{-5}$,
$10^{-4}$, and $10^{-3}$ Zsun. We show that evolution of number of
self-gravitating clumps qualitatively changes with $Z$. Vigorous fragmentation
induced by dust cooling occurs in the metal-poor cases, temporarily providing
about 10 self-gravitating clumps at $Z = 10^{-5}$ and $10^{-4}$ Zsun. However,
we also show that the fragmentation is a very sporadic process; after an early
episode of the fragmentation, the number of clumps continuously decreases as
they merge away in these cases. The vigorous fragmentation tends to occur later
with the higher $Z$, reflecting that the dust-induced fragmentation is most
efficient at the lower density. At $Z = 10^{-3}$ Zsun, as a result, the clump
number stays smallest until the disc fragmentation starts in a late stage. We
also show that the clump mass distribution also depends on the metallicity. A
single or binary clump substantially more massive than the others appear only
at $Z = 10^{-3}$ Zsun, whereas they are more evenly distributed in mass at the
lower metallicities. We suggest that the disc fragmentation should provide the
stellar multiple systems, but their properties drastically change with a tiny
amount of metals.

K2 over the heliocentric distance range 9 < r_H < 16 AU. The comet continues to
be characterized by a coma of sub-millimeter and larger particles ejected at
low velocity. In a fixed co-moving volume around the nucleus we find that the
scattering cross-section of the coma is related to the heliocentric distance by
a power law with heliocentric index $s = 1.14\pm0.05$. This dependence is
significantly weaker than the inverse square variation of the insolation as a
result of two effects. These are, first, the heliocentric dependence of the
dust velocity and, second, a lag effect due to very slow-moving particles
ejected long before the observations were taken. A Monte Carlo model of the
photometry shows that dust production beginning at r_H ~ 35 AU is needed to
match the measured heliocentric index, with only a slight dependence on the
particle size distribution. Mass loss rates in dust at 10 AU are of order 1000
kg/s, while loss rates in gas may be much smaller, depending on the unknown
dust to gas ratio. Consequently, the ratio of the non-gravitational
acceleration to the local solar gravity may, depending on the nucleus size,
attain values comparable to values found in short-period comets at much smaller
distances. Non-gravitational acceleration in C/2017 K2 and similarly distant
comets, while presently unmeasured, may limit the accuracy with which we can
infer the properties of the Oort cloud from the orbits of long-period comets.

  Detection using Multi-modal Data",,,,,"cs.CL cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the rapid evolution of social media, fake news has become a significant
social problem, which cannot be addressed in a timely manner using manual
investigation. This has motivated numerous studies on automating fake news
detection. Most studies explore supervised training models with different
modalities (e.g., text, images, and propagation networks) of news records to
identify fake news. However, the performance of such techniques generally drops
if news records are coming from different domains (e.g., politics,
entertainment), especially for domains that are unseen or rarely-seen during
training. As motivation, we empirically show that news records from different
domains have significantly different word usage and propagation patterns.
Furthermore, due to the sheer volume of unlabelled news records, it is
challenging to select news records for manual labelling so that the
domain-coverage of the labelled dataset is maximized. Hence, this work: (1)
proposes a novel framework that jointly preserves domain-specific and
cross-domain knowledge in news records to detect fake news from different
domains; and (2) introduces an unsupervised technique to select a set of
unlabelled informative news records for manual labelling, which can be
ultimately used to train a fake news detection model that performs well for
many domains while minimizing the labelling cost. Our experiments show that the
integration of the proposed fake news model and the selective annotation
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for cross-domain news datasets,
while yielding notable improvements for rarely-appearing domains in news
datasets.

However, the direct aggregation of images across sites is contraindicated for

inconsistent contrast, resolution, and noise. To this end, in the absence of

have been used to harmonize image sets between a source and target domain.
Importantly, these methods are prone to instability, contrast inversion,
intractable manipulation of pathology, and steganographic mappings which limit
their reliable adoption in real-world medical imaging. In this work, based on
an underlying assumption that morphological shape is consistent across imaging

reduce inter-scanner heterogeneity while preserving anatomical layout. We
replace the affine transformations used in the normalization layers within
generative networks with trainable scale and shift parameters conditioned on
jointly learned anatomical segmentation embeddings to modulate features at
every level of translation. We evaluate our methodologies against recent
baselines across several imaging modalities (T1w MRI, FLAIR MRI, and OCT) on

GANs yields superior image harmonization as quantified by Inception distances,
demonstrates improved downstream utility via post-hoc segmentation accuracy,
and improved robustness to translation perturbation and self-adversarial

development, regardless of task assignments at project initiation. Objective:
While this phenomenon has been noted, prior research has not sought to
understand these dominant individuals. Previous work has found that core
communicators are the gatekeepers of their teams' knowledge, and the
performance of these members was correlated with their teams' success. Building
on this work, we have employed a longitudinal approach to study the way core
developers' attitudes, knowledge sharing behaviors and task performance change
over the course of their project. Method: We first used Social Network Analysis
(SNA) and standard statistical analysis techniques to identify and select
artifacts and central practitioners from ten different software development
teams. We then applied psycholinguistic analysis and directed content analysis
(CA) techniques to interpret the content of these practitioners' messages.
Finally, we inspected core developers' activities at various points in time
during systems' development. Results: Among our findings, we observe that core
developers' attitudes and knowledge sharing behaviors were linked to their
involvement in actual software development and the demands of their wider
project teams. However, core developers appeared to naturally possess high
levels of insightful characteristics. Conclusion: Project performance would
likely benefit from strategies aimed at surrounding core developers with other
competent communicators. Core developers should also be supported by a wider
team who are willing to ask questions and challenge their ideas. Finally, the
availability of adequate communication channels would help with maintaining
positive team climate especially in distributed developments.(Abridged)

social motivation theory notes the importance of such a relationship in general
group work. We have therefore applied linguistic analysis, text mining and

474 developers to study these issues. Our results indicate that our sample of
IS developers conveyed a range of attitudes while working to deliver systems

a perturbative regime with small ellipticity ratio, we make the very first

and might in fact fail in general. Our approach involves the construction of a
new corrector theory in stochastic homogenization: while only a bounded number
of correctors can be constructed as stationary random fields in a strong sense,
we show that twice as many stationary correctors can be defined in a

we manage to reduce the number of matrix inversion to only one per iteration

sequential ISS updates requiring no matrix inversion at all. Its implementation
is straightforward and memory efficient. Numerical experiments demonstrate that
both methods achieve the same final performance as ILRMA-T in terms of several

nine per cent, indicating that heating from active galactic nuclei and other
relevant processes does not produce significant deviations from hydrostatic

joint model across a large amount of decentralized computing devices. Existing
methods, e.g., Federated Averaging (FedAvg), are able to provide an
optimization guarantee by synchronously training the joint model, but usually
suffer from stragglers, i.e., IoT devices with low computing power or
communication bandwidth, especially on heterogeneous optimization problems. To
mitigate the influence of stragglers, this paper presents a novel FL algorithm,
namely Hybrid Federated Learning (HFL), to achieve a learning balance in
efficiency and effectiveness. It consists of two major components: synchronous
kernel and asynchronous updater. Unlike traditional synchronous FL methods, our
HFL introduces the asynchronous updater which actively pulls unsynchronized and
delayed local weights from stragglers. An adaptive approximation method,
Adaptive Delayed-SGD (AD-SGD), is proposed to merge the delayed local updates
into the joint model. The theoretical analysis of HFL shows that the
convergence rate of the proposed algorithm is $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{t+\tau})$

sub-bands around $f_*$, 4$f_*$/3, and 2$f_*$, where $f_*$ denotes the star's

no contribution to the H chemical bond. There is an explicit linear relation
between the dz2-band center and the H bond strength. The dz2-band center is
proposed as an activity descriptor for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We
demonstrate that the dz2-band center is valid for the single-atom active sites

In this work, we creatively explore a hybrid block-structured pruning (BP) and

hardware and software reconfiguration to maximally save energy for

shrunken search space based on the first level optimization and searches
multiple pattern sets with diverse sparsity for PP via reinforcement learning
to support lightweight software reconfiguration, which corresponds to available
frequency levels of DVFS (i.e., hardware reconfiguration). At run-time, RT3 can
switch the lightweight pattern sets within 45ms to guarantee the required

RT3 can prolong battery life over 4x improvement with less than 1% accuracy

powerful tracers of the physical and chemical disk structures. The abundance
ratios of HCN and its isomer HNC are known to be sensitive to gas temperature.
Their line ratios might therefore offer a unique opportunity to probe the
properties of the emitting gas. Using the 2D thermochemical code DALI, we ran a
set of disk models accounting for different stellar and disk properties, with
an updated chemical network for the nitrogen chemistry. These modeling results
were then compared with observations, including new ALMA observations of HNC
$J=3-2$ for the TW Hya disk and HNC $J=1-0$ for 29 disks in Lupus. Similar to
CN, HCN and HNC have brighter line emission in models with larger disk flaring
angles and higher UV fluxes. HNC and HCN are predicted to be abundant in the
warm surface layer and outer midplane region, which results in ring-shaped
emission patterns. However, the precise emitting regions and emission
morphology depend on the probed transition, as well as on other parameters such
as C and O abundances. The modeled HNC-to-HCN line intensity ratio increases
from $<0.1$ in the inner disk to up to 0.8 in the outer disk regions, which can
be explained by efficient HNC destruction at high temperatures. Disk-integrated
HNC line fluxes from current scarce observations and its radial distribution in
the TW Hya disk are broadly consistent with our model predictions. The
HNC-to-HCN flux ratio robustly increases with radius (decreasing temperature),
but its use as a chemical thermometer in disks is affected by other factors,
including UV flux and C and O abundances. High-spatial resolution ALMA disk
observations of HNC and HCN that can locate the emitting layers would have the
great potential to constrain both the disk thermal and UV radiation structures,
and also to verify our understanding of the nitrogen chemistry.

polarisation can help to disentangle the location of the various polarising
mechanisms and then give an insight on the physics taking place on the core of
AGNs. We obtained a new data set of HAR polarimetric images of the archetypal
Seyfert 2 nucleus of NGC 1068 observed with SPHERE/VLT and we aim in this paper
at presenting the polarisation maps and at spatially separating the location of
the polarising mechanisms, thus deriving constraints on the organisation of the
dust material in the inner region of this AGN. We then compared these
measurements to radiative transfer simulations of scattering and dichroic
absorption processes, using the Monte-Carlo code MontAGN. We establish a
detailed table of the relative importance of the polarising mechanism as a
function of the aperture and of the wavelength. We are able to separate the
dominant polarising mechanisms in the three regions of the ionisation cone, the
extended envelop of the torus and the very central bright source of the AGN.
Thus, we estimate the contribution of the different polarisation mechanisms to
the observed polarisation flux in these regions. Dichroic absorption is
estimated to be responsible for about 99 % of the polarised flux coming from
the photo-centre. However, this contribution would be restricted to this
location only, double scattering process being the most important contributor
to polarisation in the equatorial plane of the AGN and single scattering being
dominant in the polar outflow bi-cone.

tasks in the system engineering. They need to be done automatically, fast and
frequently, as measurements arrive. Deep Learning (DL) holds the promise of
tackling the challenge, however in so far, as PE and SE in power systems is
concerned, (a) DL did not win trust of the system operators because of the lack
of the physics of electricity based, interpretations and (b) DL remained
illusive in the operational regimes were data is scarce. To address this, we
present a hybrid scheme which embeds physics modeling of power systems into
Graphical Neural Networks (GNN), therefore empowering system operators with a
reliable and explainable real-time predictions which can then be used to
control the critical infrastructure. To enable progress towards trustworthy DL
for PE and SE, we build a physics-informed method, named Power-GNN, which
reconstructs physical, thus interpretable, parameters within Effective Power
Flow (EPF) models, such as admittances of effective power lines, and NN
parameters, representing implicitly unobserved elements of the system. In our
experiments, we test the Power-GNN on different realistic power networks,
including these with thousands of loads and hundreds of generators. We show
that the Power-GNN outperforms vanilla NN scheme unaware of the EPF physics.

formation. Here, we evaluate the use of a Single-Halo model (SHM) as an
efficient method to estimate the strong lensing cluster core mass, testing it
with ray-traced images from the `Outer Rim' simulation. Unlike detailed lens
models, the SHM represents the cluster mass distribution with a single halo and
can be automatically generated from the measured lensing constraints. We find
that the projected core mass estimated with this method, M$_{\rm SHM}$, has a
scatter of $8.52\%$ and a bias of $0.90\%$ compared to the ""true"" mass within
the same aperture. Our analysis shows no systematic correlation between the
scatter or bias and the lens-source system properties. The bias and scatter can
be reduced to $3.26\%$ and $0.34\%$, respectively, by excluding models that
fail a visual inspection test. We find that the SHM success depends on the
lensing geometry, with single giant arc configurations accounting for most of
the failed cases due to their limiting constraining power. When excluding such
cases, we measure a scatter and bias of $3.88\%$ and $0.84\%$, respectively.
Finally, we find that when the source redshift is unknown, the model-predicted
redshifts are overestimated, and the M$_{\rm SHM}$ is underestimated by a few
percent, highlighting the importance of securing spectroscopic redshifts of
background sources. Our analysis provides a quantitative characterization of
M$_{\rm SHM}$, enabling its efficient use as a tool to estimate the strong
lensing cluster core masses in the large samples, expected from current and
future surveys.

enormous sensitivity of THz radiation to a spatial range of its

decentralized infrastructure is uniquely suited for meeting this challenge and
enable technical solutions and social institutions in a mutually reinforcing
dynamic to achieve Responsible AI goals. Our approach is novel in its
sociotechnical approach and its aim in tackling the structural issues that

result in a Schottky barrier height (SBH), which is usually difficult to tune.
This makes it challenging to efficiently inject both electrons and holes using
the same metal - an essential requirement for several applications, including
light-emitting devices and complementary logic. Interestingly, modulating the
SBH in the Schottky-Mott limit of de-pinned van der Waals (vdW) contacts
becomes possible. However, accurate extraction of the SBH is essential to
exploit such contacts to their full potential. In this work, we propose a
simple technique to accurately estimate the SBH at the vdW contact interfaces
by circumventing several ambiguities associated with SBH extraction. Using this
technique on several vdW contacts, including metallic 2H-TaSe$_2$,
semi-metallic graphene, and degenerately doped semiconducting SnSe$_2$, we
demonstrate that vdW contacts exhibit a universal de-pinned nature. Superior
ambipolar carrier injection properties of vdW contacts are demonstrated (with
Au contact as a reference) in two applications, namely, (a) pulsed
electroluminescence from monolayer WS$_2$ using few-layer graphene (FLG)

testing tools to achieve satisfactory effectiveness, especially on industrial
apps with rich features and large code bases. Our experiences suggest that
existing mobile UI testing tools are prone to exploration tarpits, where the
tools get stuck with a small fraction of app functionalities for an extensive
amount of time. For example, a tool logs out an app at early stages without
being able to log back in, and since then the tool gets stuck with exploring
the app's pre-login functionalities (i.e., exploration tarpits) instead of its
main functionalities. While tool vendors/users can manually hardcode rules for
the tools to avoid specific exploration tarpits, these rules can hardly
generalize, being fragile in face of diverted testing environments and fast app
iterations. To identify and resolve exploration tarpits, we propose VET, a
general approach including a supporting system for the given specific Android
UI testing tool on the given specific app under test (AUT). VET runs the tool
on the AUT for some time and records UI traces, based on which VET identifies
exploration tarpits by recognizing their patterns in the UI traces. VET then
pinpoints the actions (e.g., clicking logout) or the screens that lead to or
exhibit exploration tarpits. In subsequent test runs, VET guides the testing
tool to prevent or recover from exploration tarpits. From our evaluation with
state-of-the-art Android UI testing tools on popular industrial apps, VET
identifies exploration tarpits that cost up to 98.6% testing time budget. These
exploration tarpits reveal not only limitations in UI exploration strategies
but also defects in tool implementations. VET automatically addresses the
identified exploration tarpits, enabling each evaluated tool to achieve higher
code coverage and improve crash-triggering capabilities.

have been extensively used for understating the reheating phase of the
universe, but they have never been used to study the inflationary phase itself
far from the end of inflation (i.e. about 50 e-folds before the end of
inflation). In this paper we use a lattice simulation to reproduce the
well-known results of some simple models of single-field inflation,
particularly for the scalar field perturbation. The main model that we consider
is the standard slow-roll inflation with an harmonic potential for the inflaton
field. We explore the technical aspects that need to be accounted for in order
to reproduce with precision the nearly scale invariant power spectrum of
inflaton perturbations. We also consider the case of a step potential, and show
that the simulation is able to correctly reproduce the oscillatory features in
the power spectrum of this model. Even if a lattice simulation is not needed in
these cases, that are well within the regime of validity of linear perturbation
theory, this sets the basis to future work on using lattice simulations to
study more complicated models of inflation.

mode by abandoning its adherence to deterministic passenger-driver matching for
door-to-door journeys, and by adopting instead stochastic matching on a network
of fixed meeting points. Stochastic matching is where a passenger sends out a
carpooling request at a meeting point, and then waits for the arrival of a
self-selected driver who is already travelling to the requested meeting point.
Crucially there is no centrally dispatched driver. Moreover, the carpooling is
assured only between the meeting points, so the onus is on the passengers to
travel to/from them by their own means. Thus the success of a stochastic
carpooling service relies on the convergence, with minimal perturbation to
their existing travel patterns, to the meeting points which are highly
frequented by both passengers and drivers. Due to the innovative nature of
stochastic carpooling, existing off-the-shelf workflows are largely
insufficient for this purpose. To fill the gap in the market, we introduce a
novel workflow, comprising of a combination of data science and GIS (Geographic
Information Systems), to analyse driver GPS traces. We implement it for an
operational stochastic carpooling service in south-eastern France, and we
demonstrate that relaxing door-to-door matching reduces passenger waiting
times. Our workflow provides additional key operational indicators, namely the
driver flow maps, the driver flow temporal profiles and the driver
participation rates.

Shannon's entropy, as a metric for information freshness. We consider a system
in which a central monitor observes multiple binary Markov processes through a
communication channel. The UoI of a Markov process corresponds to the monitor's
uncertainty about its state. At each time step, only one Markov process can be
selected to update its state to the monitor; hence there is a tradeoff among
the UoIs of the processes that depend on the scheduling policy used to select
the process to be updated. The age of information (AoI) of a process
corresponds to the time since its last update. In general, the associated UoI
can be a non-increasing function, or even an oscillating function, of its AoI,
making the scheduling problem particularly challenging. This paper investigates
scheduling policies that aim to minimize the average sum-UoI of the processes
over the infinite time horizon. We formulate the problem as a restless
multi-armed bandit (RMAB) problem, and develop a Whittle index policy that is
near-optimal for the RMAB after proving its indexability. We further provide an
iterative algorithm to compute the Whittle index for the practical deployment
of the policy. Although this paper focuses on UoI scheduling, our results apply
to a general class of RMABs for which the UoI scheduling problem is a special
case. Specifically, this paper's Whittle index policy is valid for any RMAB in
which the bandits are binary Markov processes and the penalty is a concave
function of the belief state of the Markov process. Numerical results
demonstrate the excellent performance of the Whittle index policy for this
class of RMABs.

a primal-dual based algorithm that achieves a problem-dependent logarithmic
regret bound. The BwK problem extends the multi-arm bandit (MAB) problem to
model the resource consumption associated with playing each arm, and the
existing BwK literature has been mainly focused on deriving asymptotically
optimal distribution-free regret bounds. We first study the primal and dual
linear programs underlying the BwK problem. From this primal-dual perspective,
we discover symmetry between arms and knapsacks, and then propose a new notion
of sub-optimality measure for the BwK problem. The sub-optimality measure
highlights the important role of knapsacks in determining algorithm regret and
inspires the design of our two-phase algorithm. In the first phase, the
algorithm identifies the optimal arms and the binding knapsacks, and in the
second phase, it exhausts the binding knapsacks via playing the optimal arms
through an adaptive procedure. Our regret upper bound involves the proposed
sub-optimality measure and it has a logarithmic dependence on length of horizon
$T$ and a polynomial dependence on $m$ (the numbers of arms) and $d$ (the
number of knapsacks). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
problem-dependent logarithmic regret bound for solving the general BwK problem.

spread rapidly. This virus targets the lungs, causing respiratory distress
which can be mild or severe. The X-ray or computed tomography (CT) images of
lungs can reveal whether the patient is infected with COVID-19 or not. Many
researchers are trying to improve COVID-19 detection using artificial
intelligence. Our motivation is to develop an automatic method that can cope
with scenarios in which preparing labeled data is time consuming or expensive.
In this article, we propose a Semi-supervised Classification using Limited
Labeled Data (SCLLD) relying on Sobel edge detection and Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) to automate the COVID-19 diagnosis. The GAN discriminator
output is a probabilistic value which is used for classification in this work.
The proposed system is trained using 10,000 CT scans collected from Omid
Hospital, whereas a public dataset is also used for validating our system. The
proposed method is compared with other state-of-the-art supervised methods such
as Gaussian processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time a
semi-supervised method for COVID-19 detection is presented. Our system is
capable of learning from a mixture of limited labeled and unlabeled data where
supervised learners fail due to a lack of sufficient amount of labeled data.
Thus, our semi-supervised training method significantly outperforms the
supervised training of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) when labeled training
data is scarce. The 95% confidence intervals for our method in terms of
accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are 99.56 +- 0.20%, 99.88 +- 0.24%, and
99.40 +- 0.18%, respectively, whereas intervals for the CNN (trained
supervised) are 68.34 +- 4.11%, 91.2 +- 6.15%, and 46.40 +- 5.21%.

observed in the mid-infrared: $\omega_1$, $\omega_2$, $\omega_3$, $2\omega_1$,
$2\omega_2$, $\omega_1 +\omega_3$, $\omega_2 +\omega_3$, and

with the interaction of the water molecule dipole moment with a lattice-induced

  We propose a white-box approach that models configuration-dependent

influence of configuration decisions on individual methods, supporting system
understanding and performance debugging. The approach consists of two steps:
First, we use a coarse-grained profiler and learn performance-influence models
for all methods, potentially identifying some methods that are highly
configuration- and performance-sensitive, causing inaccurate predictions.
Second, we re-measure these methods with a fine-grained profiler and learn more
accurate models, at higher cost, though. By means of 9 real-world Java software
systems, we demonstrate that our approach can efficiently identify
configuration-relevant methods and learn accurate performance-influence models.

based on Density Functional Theory (DFT). We investigate the reaction paths for
several chemical reactions, for both isolated alkane molecules and a
crystalline model of polyethylene, and confirm, in some cases, the accepted
activation energies; in some other cases, we challenge the accepted view
finding alternative, more favourable, reaction paths for which we estimate the
activation energy. We highlight the infuence of the environment -- crystalline

remarkable results of our calculations is that hydroxyl radicals play an
important role in the decomposition of hydroperoxides. Based on our findings,
it should be possible to improve the set of equations and parameters used in

completely unrelated. Sakstein and Trodden [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 161301

$\mathcal{O}({\rm eV})$-mass neutrino. In this paper, in order to solve the

ending of EDE are triggered by the radiation-matter transition. The specific
example we study is a $k$-essence model. The cosmic evolution equations can be
recast into a two-dimensional dynamical system and its main properties are
analyzed. Our results suggest that $k$-essence seems unable to realize the new
scenario for EDE. However, an EDE model with different scenario is realized in
$k$-essence. In this model, the ending of EDE can be triggered by the
radiation-matter transition while the onset depends on the initial conditions
of the scalar field. Therefore, the obtained model can only be used to solve
half of the coincidence problem. The full resolution in the framework of our

amplification mechanisms difficult to pin down. To reveal the complex
transmission of country-specific uncertainty shocks in a multi-country setting,

adopting a more (passive or) accommodative stance towards the former, but a
more pro-active stance towards the latter shocks, possibly as an attempt to
tame policy uncertainty spill-overs and prevent the fragmentation of the Euro

multi-antenna Rate-Splitting (RS) at the transmitter and Successive
Interference Cancellation (SIC) at the receivers. In this work, we study the
performance of RSMA under the practical important setup of imperfect Channel
State Information at Transmitter (CSIT) originating from user mobility and
latency in the network. First, we derive a lower bound on the ergodic sum-rate

under standard testing conditions, deep networks often fail to generalize to
out-of-distribution (o.o.d.) samples. One cause for this shortcoming is that
modern architectures tend to rely on ""shortcuts"" - superficial features that
correlate with categories without capturing deeper invariants that hold across
contexts. Real-world concepts often possess a complex structure that can vary
superficially across contexts, which can make the most intuitive and promising
solutions in one context not generalize to others. One potential way to improve
o.o.d. generalization is to assume simple solutions are unlikely to be valid
across contexts and avoid them, which we refer to as the too-good-to-be-true
prior. A low-capacity network (LCN) with a shallow architecture should only be
able to learn surface relationships, including shortcuts. We find that LCNs can
serve as shortcut detectors. Furthermore, an LCN's predictions can be used in a
two-stage approach to encourage a high-capacity network (HCN) to rely on deeper
invariant features that should generalize broadly. In particular, items that
the LCN can master are downweighted when training the HCN. Using a modified
version of the CIFAR-10 dataset in which we introduced shortcuts, we found that
the two-stage LCN-HCN approach reduced reliance on shortcuts and facilitated
o.o.d. generalization.

implementation of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), mismatch causes parameter
variation between identically-configured neurons and synapses. Each chip

expensive and difficult. Here we present a supervised learning approach that
produces SNNs with high robustness to mismatch and other common sources of

mimicking a pre-trained dynamical system, using a local learning rule from
non-linear control theory. We demonstrate our method on two tasks requiring

products, and graph monoids (also known as free partially commutative monoids).
If the monoids in question are groups, then any graph product is, of course, a
group. For monoids that are not groups, regularity is perhaps the first and
most important algebraic property that one considers; however, graph products
of regular monoids are not in general regular. We show that a graph product of
regular monoids satisfies the related, but weaker, condition of being abundant.
More generally, we show that the classes of left abundant and left Fountain
monoids are closed under graph product. The notions of abundancy and
Fountainicity and their one-sided versions arise from many sources, for
example, that of abundancy from projectivity of monogenic acts, and that of
Fountainicity (also known as weak abundancy) from connections with ordered
categories. As a very special case we obtain the earlier result of Fountain and
Kambites that the graph product of right cancellative monoids is right
cancellative. To achieve our aims we show that elements in (arbitrary) graph
products have a unique Foata normal form, and give some useful reduction
results; these may equally well be applied to groups as to the broader case of
monoids.

properties of the Sun's interior. By measuring helioseismic travel times
between different location on the surface, flows and other interior properties
can be inferred using so-called sensitivity kernels which relate the amount of
travel-time shift with variations in interior proporties. In particular,
sensitivity kernels for flows have been developed in the past, using either ray
or Born approximation, and have been used to infer solar interior flows such as
the meridional circulation which is of particular interest for understanding
the structure and dynamics of the Sun. Here we introduce a new method for
deriving three-dimensional sensitivity kernels for large-scale horizontal flows
in the solar interior. We perform global-Sun wave-propagation simulations
through 784 small flow perturbations placed individually in the interior of a
simulated Sun, and measure the shifts in helioseismic travel times caused by
these perturbations. Each measurement corresponds to a linear equation
connecting the flow perturbation velocities and the sensitivity kernels. By
solving the resulting large set of coupled linear equations, we derive
three-dimensional sensitivity kernels for horizontal flows which have a
longitudinal component (parallel to the wave's travel direction) and a
transverse component (perpendicular to the wave's travel direction). The
kernels exhibit a ""banana"" shape, similar to kernels derived using Born
approximation methods, and show that transverse components are not negligible
in inversions for interior flows.

""banana"". Alternatively, one could opt for field-specific keywords or
hierarchical structures (e.g. PubMed's Medical Subject Headings, MeSH) to
compute ""interest market share"". Using this approach, we uncovered plausible

phenomenon of speculation implicitly assumes simultaneity in media consumption,
there is a gap for catching-up users, who cannot directly appreciate the
consumption experiences. This conversely suggests that there is potential for
computational support to enhance the consumption experiences of catching-up
users. Accordingly, we conducted a series of studies to pave the way for
developing computational support for catching-up users. First, we conducted
semi-structured interviews to understand how people are engaging with

social viewing experiences sharing immediate reactions that have been discussed

model statistical and physical relationships between data, signals, and
processes. In some applications, such as data processing in graphs that
represent physical networks, the initial network topology is known. However,
disconnections of edges in the network change the topology and may affect the
signals and processes over the network. In this paper, we consider the problem
of edge disconnection identification in networks by using concepts from graph
signal processing (GSP). We assume that the graph signals measured over the
vertices of the network can be represented as white noise that has been
filtered on the graph topology by a smooth graph filter. We develop the
likelihood ratio test (LRT) to detect a specific set of edge disconnections.
Then, we provide the maximum likelihood (ML) decision rule for identifying
general scenarios of edge disconnections in the network. It is shown that the
sufficient statistics of the LRT and ML decision rule are the graph frequency
energy levels in the graph spectral domain. However, the ML decision rule leads
to a high-complexity exhaustive search over the edges in the network and is
practically infeasible. Thus, we propose a low-complexity greedy method that
identifies a single disconnected edge at each iteration. Moreover, by using the
smoothness of the considered graph filter, we suggest a local implementation of
the decision rule, which is based solely on the measurements at neighboring
vertices. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform
existing detection and identification methods on a synthetic dataset and for
line outage identification in power systems from the IEEE 118-bus test case.

the context which is most relevant to their ads. However, its power cannot be
fully utilized unless we can target the page content using fine-grained
categories, e.g., ""coupe"" vs. ""hatchback"" instead of ""automotive"" vs. ""sport"".
The widely used advertising content taxonomy (IAB taxonomy) consists of 23
coarse-grained categories and 355 fine-grained categories. With the large
number of categories, it becomes very challenging either to collect training
documents to build a supervised classification model, or to compose
expert-written rules in a rule-based classification system. Besides, in
fine-grained classification, different categories often overlap or co-occur,
making it harder to classify accurately. In this work, we propose wiki2cat, a
method to tackle the problem of large-scaled fine-grained text classification
by tapping on Wikipedia category graph. The categories in IAB taxonomy are
first mapped to category nodes in the graph. Then the label is propagated
across the graph to obtain a list of labeled Wikipedia documents to induce text
classifiers. The method is ideal for large-scale classification problems since
it does not require any manually-labeled document or hand-curated rules or
keywords. The proposed method is benchmarked with various learning-based and
keyword-based baselines and yields competitive performance on both publicly
available datasets and a new dataset containing more than 300 fine-grained
categories.

the coarse global alignment from previous attention layer as an extra input,
the following attention layer can produce a refined version of alignment. This
amortizes the burden of learning the textual-to-acoustic alignment among
multiple attention layers and outperforms the use of only a single attention
layer in robustness. An utterance-level speaking speed factor is computed by a
jointly-trained speaking speed predictor, which takes the mean-pooled latent

inferior speech quality to an AR counterpart Tacotron 2 but an

nanometers to 300 micrometers (over four orders of magnitude) and chemical

the groundwork for the rational design of liquid marble applications.

pervasive issue in the statistical literature. A directed acyclic graph (DAG)
can represent a set of conditional independences, but different DAGs may encode
the same set of relations and are indistinguishable using observational data.
Equivalent DAGs can be collected into classes, each represented by a partially
directed graph known as essential graph (EG). Structure learning directly
conducted on the EG space, rather than on the allied space of DAGs, leads to
theoretical and computational benefits. Still, the majority of efforts in the
literature has been dedicated to Gaussian data, with less attention to methods
designed for multivariate categorical data. We then propose a Bayesian
methodology for structure learning of categorical EGs. Combining a constructive
parameter prior elicitation with a graph-driven likelihood decomposition, we
derive a closed-form expression for the marginal likelihood of a categorical EG

conditioned to have a unique open connected component (bounded or unbounded).
The model is defined on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ by passing to the limit for a sequence
of finite volume models with general boundary conditions. Several questions and

such that any infinite volume process is necessary the vacuum state in
subcritical regime (no open edges) and is non trivial in the supercritical

$p^*(d)$ are given and show that it is drastically smaller than the standard
bond percolation threshold in $\mathbb{Z}^d$. For instance $0.128<p^*(2)<0.202$

isothermal plates driven by uniform internal heating is investigated by means
of rigorous bounds. These are obtained as a function of the Rayleigh number $R$
by constructing feasible solutions to a convex variational problem, derived
using a formulation of the classical background method in terms of quadratic
auxiliary functions. When the fluid's temperature relative to the boundaries is
allowed to be positive or negative, numerical solution of the variational
problem shows that best previous bound $\langle wT \rangle \leq 1/2$ can only
be improved up to finite $R$. Indeed, we demonstrate analytically that $
\langle wT \rangle \leq 2^{-21/5} R^{1/5}$ and therefore prove that $\langle
wT\rangle< 1/2$ for $R < 65\,536$. However, if the minimum principle for
temperature is invoked, which asserts that internal temperature is at least as
large as the temperature of the isothermal boundaries, then numerically
optimised bounds are strictly smaller than $1/2$ until at least $R =3.4\times
10^{5}$. While the computational results suggest that the best bound on
$\langle wT\rangle$ approaches $1/2$ asymptotically from below as $R\rightarrow

  We use NH3 (1,1) and (2,2) maps in L1688 from the Green Bank Ammonia Survey,
smoothed to 1', and determine the physical properties from fits. We identify
the coherent cores and study the changes in temperature and velocity dispersion
from cores to the surrounding cloud. We obtain a kinetic temperature map
tracing the extended cloud, improving from previous maps tracing mostly the
cores. The cloud is 4-6 K warmer than the cores, and shows a larger velocity
dispersion (diff. = 0.15-0.25 km/s). Comparing to Herschel-based measurements,
we find that cores show kinetic temperature $\approx$1.8 K lower than the dust
temperature; while the gas temperature is higher than the dust temperature in
the cloud. We find an average p-NH3 fractional abundance (with respect to H2)
of $(4.2\pm0.2) \times 10^{-9}$ towards the coherent cores, and $(1.4\pm0.1)
\times 10^{-9}$ outside the core boundaries. Using stacked spectra, we detect
two components, one narrow and one broad, towards cores and their
neighbourhoods. We find the turbulence in the narrow component to be correlated
to the size of the structure (Pearson-r=0.54). With these unresolved regional
measurements, we obtain a turbulence-size relation of ${\sigma}_{v,NT}\propto
r^{0.5}$, similar to previous findings using multiple tracers.
  We discover that the subsonic component extends up to 0.15 pc beyond the
typical coherent boundaries, unveiling larger extents of the coherent cores and
showing gradual transition to coherence over ~0.2 pc.

demonstrated competitive performance over traditional methods on diverse graph

increasing number of layers (oversmoothing problem) and recent studies have
also shown that GCNs may perform worse in heterophilous graphs, where
neighboring nodes tend to belong to different classes (heterophily problem).
These two problems are usually viewed as unrelated, and thus are studied
independently, often at the graph filter level from a spectral perspective.
  We are the first to take a unified perspective to jointly explain the
oversmoothing and heterophily problems at the node level. Specifically, we
profile the nodes via two quantitative metrics: the relative degree of a node
(compared to its neighbors) and the node-level heterophily. Our theory shows
that the interplay of these two profiling metrics defines three cases of node
behaviors, which explain the oversmoothing and heterophily problems jointly and
can predict the performance of GCNs. Based on insights from our theory, we show
theoretically and empirically the effectiveness of two strategies:
structure-based edge correction, which learns corrected edge weights from
structural properties (i.e., degrees), and feature-based edge correction, which
learns signed edge weights from node features. Compared to other approaches,
which tend to handle well either heterophily or oversmoothing, we show that
{our model, GGCN}, which incorporates the two strategies performs well in both
problems.

carry sufficient energy to sustain the hot temperatures of the solar
atmospheric plasma. However, the thermalization of wave energy is inefficient
unless very short spatial scales are considered. Phase mixing is a mechanism
that can take energy down to dissipation lengths, but it operates over too long
a timescale. Here, we study how turbulence, driven by the nonlinear evolution
of phase-mixed torsional Alfven waves in coronal loops, is able to take wave
energy down to the dissipative scales much faster than the theory of linear
phase mixing predicts. We consider a simple model of a transversely nonuniform
cylindrical flux tube with a constant axial magnetic field. The flux tube is
perturbed by the fundamental mode of standing torsional Alfven waves. We solved
the three-dimensional (3D) ideal magnetohydrodynamics equations numerically to
study the temporal evolution. Initially, torsional Alfven waves undergo the
process of phase mixing because of the transverse variation of density. After
only few periods of torsional waves, azimuthal shear flows generated by phase
mixing eventually trigger the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHi), and the flux
tube is subsequently driven to a turbulent state. Turbulence is very
anisotropic and develops transversely only to the background magnetic field.
After the onset of turbulence, the effective Reynolds number decreases in the
flux tube much faster than in the initial linear stage governed by phase mixing
alone. We conclude that the nonlinear evolution of torsional Alfven waves, and

f(x)\,dx$, where $f(x)=g(x)/(x-t)^3,$ assuming that $g\in C^\infty[a,b]$ and
$f(x)$ is $T$-periodic, $T=b-a$. With $h=T/n$, these numerical quadrature

  \begin{align*}

$u(x)$ is in $C^\infty(\mathbb{R})$ and is $T$-periodic. Actually, we prove
that $\widehat{T}{}^{(s)}_n[f]$,
  $s=0,1,2,$ are exact for a class of singular integrals involving $T$-periodic

divided into sub-pupils by an array of microlenses, coupling the light into
single-mode fibers. The output of the fibers are rearranged in a non redundant

evolutionary computation. However, while hyper-heuristics and parameter control
studies typically assume a setting in which the algorithm needs to be chosen

ill-posed nature of the inverse reinforcement learning problem. Unfortunately
current methods generally do not scale well beyond the small tabular setting
due to the need for an inner-loop MDP solver, and even non-Bayesian methods
that do themselves scale often require extensive interaction with the
environment to perform well, being inappropriate for high stakes or costly
applications such as healthcare. In this paper we introduce our method,
Approximate Variational Reward Imitation Learning (AVRIL), that addresses both
of these issues by jointly learning an approximate posterior distribution over
the reward that scales to arbitrarily complicated state spaces alongside an
appropriate policy in a completely offline manner through a variational
approach to said latent reward. Applying our method to real medical data
alongside classic control simulations, we demonstrate Bayesian reward inference
in environments beyond the scope of current methods, as well as task
performance competitive with focused offline imitation learning algorithms.

be approached by maximizing functions that satisfy submodularity. These
optimization problems often involve complex side constraints, imposed by the
underlying application. In this paper, we develop an algorithm with
poly-logarithmic adaptivity for non-monotone submodular maximization under
general side constraints. The adaptive complexity of a problem is the minimal
number of sequential rounds required to achieve the objective.
  Our algorithm is suitable to maximize a non-monotone submodular function
under a $p$-system side constraint, and it achieves a $(p +
O(\sqrt{p}))$-approximation for this problem, after only poly-logarithmic
adaptive rounds and polynomial queries to the valuation oracle function.
Furthermore, our algorithm achieves a $(p + O(1))$-approximation when the given
side constraint is a $p$-extendible system.
  This algorithm yields an exponential speed-up, with respect to the
adaptivity, over any other known constant-factor approximation algorithm for
this problem. It also competes with previous known results in terms of the
query complexity. We perform various experiments on various real-world
applications. We find that, in comparison with commonly used heuristics, our
algorithm performs better on these instances.

that do not have Lipschitz-continuous and/or bounded gradients. Gradient
clipping is a simple and effective technique to stabilize the training process

widespread popularity, the convergence properties of the gradient clipping
heuristic are poorly understood, especially for stochastic problems. This paper
establishes both qualitative and quantitative convergence results of the
clipped stochastic (sub)gradient method (SGD) for non-smooth convex functions
with rapidly growing subgradients. Our analyses show that clipping enhances the
stability of SGD and that the clipped SGD algorithm enjoys finite convergence
rates in many cases. We also study the convergence of a clipped method with
momentum, which includes clipped SGD as a special case, for weakly convex
problems under standard assumptions. With a novel Lyapunov analysis, we show
that the proposed method achieves the best-known rate for the considered class
of problems, demonstrating the effectiveness of clipped methods also in this

Multi-temporal comparison of the point clouds obtained with these techniques
requires a tedious visual inspection to identify rockfall events which implies
inaccuracies that depend on several factors such as human expertise and the
sensibility of the sensors. This paper addresses this issue and provides an
intelligent framework for rockfall event detection for any individual working

development of such an analysis framework poses significant research challenges

understood by humans. This limits the ability of humans to use these models to
derive insights and understanding of the underlying failure mechanisms, and
also limits the degree of confidence that can be placed in such a system to
perform well on future data. We consider the task of predicting hard drive
failure in a data center using recent algorithms for interpretable machine
learning. We demonstrate that these methods provide meaningful insights about
short- and long-term drive health, while also maintaining high predictive

However, to achieve state-of-the-art performance, methods often need large

prohibitively expensive, especially for large graphs. To address these
challenges, we introduce Bootstrapped Graph Latents (BGRL) - a graph
representation learning method that learns by predicting alternative

the need for contrasting with negative examples, and is thus scalable by
design. BGRL outperforms or matches prior methods on several established
benchmarks, while achieving a 2-10x reduction in memory costs. Furthermore, we
show that BGRL can be scaled up to extremely large graphs with hundreds of
millions of nodes in the semi-supervised regime - achieving state-of-the-art
performance and improving over supervised baselines where representations are
shaped only through label information. In particular, our solution centered on
BGRL constituted one of the winning entries to the Open Graph Benchmark - Large

received more attention (comments) than consonant submissions, even though they
received lower scores through up-voting and down-voting. Users who engaged with
dissonant submissions were also more likely to return to the forum. Consistent
with identity theory, confrontation with opposing views triggered activity in

In light of the findings, theory of social identity and echo chambers is

maintain a balance between the expansiveness and contraction of volume, meaning
Lipschitz constraint on the diffeomorphic mapping and its inverse. With these

fluctuation correlation functions (FFCFs) the long-time decay constants
$\tau_2$ range from $\sim 1$ to $\sim 10$ ps which compares with experimentally

yield dynamics that decays to zero on the few ps time scale (i.e. static

market to same-sex couples. Becker's theory rationalizes the well-known
phenomenon of homogamy among different-sex couples: individuals mate with their
likes because many characteristics, such as education, consumption behaviour,
desire to nurture children, religion, etc., exhibit strong complementarities in
the household production function. However, because of asymmetries in the
distributions of male and female characteristics, men and women may need to
marry ""up"" or ""down"" according to the relative shortage of their
characteristics among the populations of men and women. Yet, among same-sex
couples, this limitation does not exist as partners are drawn from the same
population, and thus the theory of assortative mating would boldly predict that
individuals will choose a partner with nearly identical characteristics.
Empirical evidence suggests a very different picture: a robust stylized fact is
that the correlation of the characteristics is in fact weaker among same-sex
couples. In this paper, we build an equilibrium model of same-sex marriage
market which allows for straightforward identification of the gains to
marriage. We estimate the model with 2008-2012 ACS data on California and show
that positive assortative mating is weaker for homosexuals than for
heterosexuals with respect to age and race. Our results suggest that positive
assortative mating with respect to education is stronger among lesbians, and
not significantly different when comparing gay men and married different-sex
couples. As regards labor market outcomes, such as hourly wages and working
hours, we find some indications that the process of specialization within the
household mainly applies to different-sex couples.

A Tight Sample Complexity Analysis","accepted to Operations Research",,,,"stat.ML cs.IT cs.LG math.IT math.OC math.ST stat.TH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Q-learning, which seeks to learn the optimal Q-function of a Markov decision
process (MDP) in a model-free fashion, lies at the heart of reinforcement
learning. When it comes to the synchronous setting (such that independent
samples for all state-action pairs are drawn from a generative model in each
iteration), substantial progress has been made towards understanding the sample
efficiency of Q-learning. Consider a $\gamma$-discounted infinite-horizon MDP
with state space $\mathcal{S}$ and action space $\mathcal{A}$: to yield an
entrywise $\varepsilon$-approximation of the optimal Q-function,
state-of-the-art theory for Q-learning requires a sample size exceeding the
order of $\frac{|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}|}{(1-\gamma)^5\varepsilon^{2}}$,
which fails to match existing minimax lower bounds. This gives rise to natural
questions: what is the sharp sample complexity of Q-learning? Is Q-learning
provably sub-optimal? This paper addresses these questions for the synchronous
setting: (1) when $|\mathcal{A}|=1$ (so that Q-learning reduces to TD
learning), we prove that the sample complexity of TD learning is minimax
optimal and scales as $\frac{|\mathcal{S}|}{(1-\gamma)^3\varepsilon^2}$ (up to
log factor); (2) when $|\mathcal{A}|\geq 2$, we settle the sample complexity of
Q-learning to be on the order of
$\frac{|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}|}{(1-\gamma)^4\varepsilon^2}$ (up to log
factor). Our theory unveils the strict sub-optimality of Q-learning when
$|\mathcal{A}|\geq 2$, and rigorizes the negative impact of over-estimation in
Q-learning. Finally, we extend our analysis to accommodate asynchronous
Q-learning (i.e., the case with Markovian samples), sharpening the horizon
dependency of its sample complexity to be $\frac{1}{(1-\gamma)^4}$.

black hole entropy no longer obeys the area law and instead it can be given by
$S\sim A^{1+\delta/2}$, where the exponent $\delta$ ranges $0\leq\delta\leq1$,

Based on this, and using the deep connection between gravity and

cosmological equations. For this purpose, we start from the first law of
thermodynamics, $dE=TdS+WdV$, on the apparent horizon of the
Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) Universe, and derive the corresponding
modified Friedmann equations by assuming the entropy associated with the

of the generalized second law of thermodynamics for the Universe enclosed by

extract the modified Friedmann equation in the presence of Barrow entropy which
coincide with one obtained from the first law of thermodynamics. When
$\delta=0$, the results of standard cosmology are deduced.

geodynamo simulation that (to date) is the closest to the dynamical regime of
Earth's core. This model also considerably enlarges the scope of a previous
asymptotic scaling analysis. Three classes of hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic
waves are identified in the model output, all with propagation velocity largely
exceeding that of convective advection: axisymmetric, geostrophic Alfv\'en
torsional waves, and non-axisymmetric, quasi-geostrophic Alfv\'en and Rossby
waves. The contribution of these waves to the geomagnetic acceleration amounts
to an enrichment and flattening of its energy density spectral profile at
decadal time scales, thereby providing a constraint on the extent of the
$f^{-4}$ range observed in the geomagnetic frequency power spectrum. The flow
and magnetic acceleration energies carried by waves both linearly increase with
the ratio of the magnetic diffusion time scale to the Alfv\'en time scale,
highlighting the dominance of Alfv\'en waves in the signal and the stabilising
control of magnetic dissipation at non-axisymmetric scales. Extrapolation of
the results to Earth's core conditions supports the detectability of Alfv\'en
waves in geomagnetic observations, either as axisymmetric torsional
oscillations or through the geomagnetic jerks caused by non-axisymmetric waves.
In contrast, Rossby waves appear to be too fast and carry too little magnetic
energy to be detectable in geomagnetic acceleration signals of limited

ferromagnets, evidenced by robust anomalous Hall effect with hysteretic
switching behavior. The coupling between spin and valley degrees of freedom is
unambiguously demonstrated as the magnetic order is shown to be tunable with an
in-plane magnetic field, or a perpendicular electric field. In addition, we
examine the influence of SOC on the isospin order and stability of
superconductivity. Our findings establish an efficient experimental knob to

the properties of the quiet solar wind with no magnetic switchbacks. The two

in different magnetic pressures measured by PSP in the two plasma states. Solar

implement the GA with generous diversity in the populations by selecting pairs

  Estimation",,,,,"stat.ME cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper develops a sparsity-inducing version of Bayesian Causal Forests, a
recently proposed nonparametric causal regression model that employs Bayesian
Additive Regression Trees and is specifically designed to estimate
heterogeneous treatment effects using observational data. The sparsity-inducing
component we introduce is motivated by empirical studies where not all the
available covariates are relevant, leading to different degrees of sparsity
underlying the surfaces of interest in the estimation of individual treatment
effects. The extended version presented in this work, which we name Shrinkage
Bayesian Causal Forest, is equipped with an additional pair of priors allowing
the model to adjust the weight of each covariate through the corresponding
number of splits in the tree ensemble. These priors improve the model's
adaptability to sparse data generating processes and allow to perform fully
Bayesian feature shrinkage in a framework for treatment effects estimation, and
thus to uncover the moderating factors driving heterogeneity. In addition, the
method allows prior knowledge about the relevant confounding covariates and the
relative magnitude of their impact on the outcome to be incorporated in the
model. We illustrate the performance of our method in simulated studies, in
comparison to Bayesian Causal Forest and other state-of-the-art models, to
demonstrate how it scales up with an increasing number of covariates and how it
handles strongly confounded scenarios. Finally, we also provide an example of
application using real-world data.

by dense ground networks, may be used to estimate the orientation of the
trajectory of a fireball (Pujol et al., 2005) as well as fragmentation
locations (Kalenda et al., 2014; Edwards and Hildebrand, 2004). Distinguishing
ballistic arrivals (from the cylindrical shock of the fireball)from
fragmentation generated signals (quasi-spherical sources) remains a challenge,
but are obtainable through analysis of the acoustic path and the timing
observed at ground instruments. Here we describe an integrated computer code,
termed the Bolide Acoustic Modelling program or BAM, to estimate fireball
trajectories and energetics. We develop a new methodology for measuring energy
release from bolide fragmentation episodes solely from acoustic measurements
and incorporate this into BAM. We also explore the sensitivity of
seismo-acoustic fireball solutions and energy estimates to uncertainty in the
underlying atmospheric model. Applying BAM to the Stubenberg meteorite
producing fireball, we find the total fireball energy from ballistic arrivals
to be approximately $5 \times 10^{10}$J which compares favorably to the optical
estimate of $4.36 \times 10^{10}$J. The combined fragmentation energy of the
Stubenberg event from acoustic data was found to be $1.47^{+0.28}_{-0.12}
\times 10^{10}$J, roughly one third of the ballistic or optical total energy.
We also show that measuring fireball velocities from acoustic data alone is
very challenging but may be possible for slow, deeply penetrating fireballs
with shallow entry angles occurring over dense seismic/infrasound networks.

advantage of mitigating internal language competition, especially when the
shared vocabulary and model parameters are restricted in their size. However,
the performance of using multiple encoders and decoders on zero-shot

the non-shared architecture and universal NMT by differentiating the
Transformer layers between language-specific and interlingua. By selectively
sharing parameters and applying cross-attentions, we explore maximizing the
representation universality and realizing the best alignment of
language-agnostic information. We also introduce a denoising auto-encoding
(DAE) objective to jointly train the model with the translation task in a

show that our proposed model achieves a competitive or better results than
universal NMT and strong pivot baseline. Moreover, we experiment incrementally

solving complex games, such as Atari or Starcraft, and to a huge impact in
real-world applications, such as cybersecurity or autonomous driving. In the
side of the drawbacks, recent works have shown how the performance of RL
algorithms decreases under the influence of soft changes in the reward
function. However, little work has been done about how sensitive these
disturbances are depending on the aggressiveness of the attack and the learning
exploration strategy. In this paper, we propose to fill this gap in the
literature analyzing the effects of different attack strategies based on reward
perturbations, and studying the effect in the learner depending on its
exploration strategy. In order to explain all the behaviors, we choose a
sub-class of MDPs: episodic, stochastic goal-only-rewards MDPs, and in
particular, an intelligible grid domain as a benchmark. In this domain, we
demonstrate that smoothly crafting adversarial rewards are able to mislead the
learner, and that using low exploration probability values, the policy learned
is more robust to corrupt rewards. Finally, in the proposed learning scenario,
a counterintuitive result arises: attacking at each learning episode is the
lowest cost attack strategy.

automotive industry is facing. In this context, quality defines the degree to
which an object meets expectations and requirements. Especially, automated
vehicles at SAE level 4 and 5 will be expected to operate safely in various
contexts and complex situations without misconduct. Thus, a systematic approach
is needed to show their safe operation. A way to address this challenge is
simulation-based testing as pure physical testing is not feasible. During
simulation-based testing, the data used to evaluate the actual quality of an
automated driving system are generated using a simulation. However, to rely on
these simulation data, the overall simulation, which also includes its
simulation models, must provide a certain quality level. This quality level
depends on the intended purpose for which the generated simulation data should
be used. Therefore, three categories of quality can be considered: quality of
the automated driving system and simulation quality, consisting of simulation
model quality and scenario quality. Hence, quality must be determined and
evaluated in various process steps in developing and testing automated driving
systems, the overall simulation, and the simulation models used for the
simulation. In this paper, we propose a taxonomy to serve a better
understanding of the concept of quality in the development and testing process
to have a clear separation and insight where further testing is needed -- both
in terms of automated driving systems and simulation, including their
simulation models and scenarios used for testing.

The result of this approach is a novel PAC bound that is tighter when the base
learner adapts quickly, which is precisely the goal of meta-learning. We show
that our bound provides a tighter guarantee than other bounds on a toy

We first outline a general framework by recalling concepts from higher category

three conjectures that enrich this framework. We first propose that the
(infinity, 1)-category of a geometric structure known as perfectoid diamond is
an (infinity, 1)-topos. In order to construct a topology on the (infinity,
1)-category of diamonds we then propose that topological localization, in the
sense of Grothendieck-Rezk-Lurie (infinity, 1)-topoi, extends to the (infinity,
1)-category of diamonds. We provide a small-scale model using triangulated
categories. Finally, our meta-model takes the form of Efimov K-theory of the
(infinity, 1)-category of perfectoid diamonds, which illustrates structural
equivalences between the category of diamonds and subjective experience (i.e.
its privacy, self-containedness, and self-reflexivity). Based on this, we
investigate implications of the model. We posit a grammar (""n-declension"") for
a novel language to express n-awareness, accompanied by a new temporal scheme

of time: how is change possible and what do we mean by simultaneity and
coincidence? We also examine the notion of ""self"" within our framework. A new
model of personal identity is introduced which resembles a categorical version
of the ""bundle theory""; selves are not substances in which properties inhere

observe the number of customers in the system and then decide to join or to
balk. Customers are served in order of arrival. After being served, each
customer either successfully completes the service and departs the system with
probability $q$, or the service fails and the customer immediately joins the
end of the queue to wait to be served again until she successfully completes
it.
  We analyse this decision problem as a noncooperative game among the
customers. We show that there exists a unique symmetric Nash equilibrium
threshold strategy. We then prove that the symmetric Nash equilibrium threshold
strategy is evolutionarily stable. Moreover, if we relax the strategy
restrictions by allowing customers to renege, in the new Nash equilibrium,
customers have a greater incentive to join. However, this does not necessarily
increase the equilibrium expected payoff, and for some parameter values, it
decreases it.

that existing legislation and regulation provides insufficient protection to

this realisation, there has been a proliferation of principle-based ethics
codes, guidelines and frameworks. However, it has become increasingly clear
that a significant gap exists between the theory of AI ethics principles and
the practical design of AI systems. In previous work, we analysed whether it is
possible to close this gap between the what and the how of AI ethics through
the use of tools and methods designed to help AI developers, engineers, and
designers translate principles into practice. We concluded that this method of
closure is currently ineffective as almost all existing translational tools and
methods are either too flexible (and thus vulnerable to ethics washing) or too
strict (unresponsive to context). This raised the question: if, even with
technical guidance, AI ethics is challenging to embed in the process of
algorithmic design, is the entire pro-ethical design endeavour rendered futile?
And, if no, then how can AI ethics be made useful for AI practitioners? This is
the question we seek to address here by exploring why principles and technical
translational tools are still needed even if they are limited, and how these
limitations can be potentially overcome by providing theoretical grounding of a
concept that has been termed Ethics as a Service.

evolution operators only perform on complete graphs, huge resource consumption
for finding the solution on large search spaces. To overcome these limitations,
this paper describes a MFEA-based approach to solve the CluSPT. The proposed
algorithm utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to construct the spanning trees in
clusters while using evolutionary operators for building the spanning tree
connecting clusters. This approach takes advantage of both exact and
approximate algorithms so it enables the algorithm to function efficiently on
complete and sparse graphs alike. Furthermore, evolutionary operators such as
individual encoding and decoding methods are also designed with great
consideration regarding performance and memory usage. We have included a proof
on the repairing method's efficacy in ensuring all solutions are valid. We have
conducted tests on various types of Euclidean instances to assess the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and methods. Experiment results point
out the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm existing heuristic algorithms

parallelizable tasks such as machine translation with efficient decoding, or
less parallelizable tasks such as open-domain text generation to guarantee

are acquired by the same sensor. However, in many real-life scenarios, e.g.,
natural disaster, it is more practical to use the latest available images
before and after the occurrence of incidence, which may be acquired using
different sensors. In particular, we are interested in the combination of the
images acquired by optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors. SAR
images appear vastly different from the optical images even when capturing the
same scene. Adding to this, change detection methods are often constrained to
use only target image-pair, no labeled data, and no additional unlabeled data.
Such constraints limit the scope of traditional supervised machine learning and
unsupervised generative approaches for multi-sensor change detection. Recent
rapid development of self-supervised learning methods has shown that some of
them can even work with only few images. Motivated by this, in this work we
propose a method for multi-sensor change detection using only the unlabeled

self-supervised fashion by using deep clustering and contrastive learning. The
proposed method is evaluated on four multi-modal bi-temporal scenes showing

extension or the generalization of the Fourier transform (FT). The Unilateral
Laplace transform (LT) is observed to be the special case of GFT. GFT, as
proposed in this work, contributes significantly to the scholarly literature.
There are many salient contribution of this work. Firstly, GFT is applicable to
a much larger class of signals, some of which cannot be analyzed with FT and
LT. For example, we have shown the applicability of GFT on the polynomially
decaying functions and super exponentials. Secondly, we demonstrate the
efficacy of GFT in solving the initial value problems (IVPs). Thirdly, the
generalization presented for FT is extended for other integral transforms with
examples shown for wavelet transform and cosine transform. Likewise,
generalized Gamma function is also presented. One interesting application of
GFT is the computation of generalized moments, for the otherwise non-finite
moments, of any random variable such as the Cauchy random variable. Fourthly,
we introduce Fourier scale transform (FST) that utilizes GFT with the
topological isomorphism of an exponential map. Lastly, we propose Generalized
Discrete-Time Fourier transform (GDTFT). The DTFT and unilateral $z$-transform
are shown to be the special cases of the proposed GDTFT. The properties of GFT
and GDTFT have also been discussed.

particle system. The single fluid MHD description of a plasma is sufficiently
adequate to study plasma phenomena . A plasma containing multi-species of
particles can also be described by representing each particle species by the
corresponding fluid. A partially ionized plasma consisting of electrons, ions
and the neutral particles can be described as a single fluid by appropriately
combining the dynamics of each of the species. The three component plasma can
also be reduced to a two-fluid system. The most obvious way is to combine the
electron and the ion fluids to obtain a single fluid in the MHD limit and the
neutral particles to form the second fluid. The other two possibilities are 1)
to combine electron fluid and the neutral fluid into one fluid, here,
christened as ENe fluid, and treat the ions as the second fluid and 2) to
combine the ion fluid and the neutral fluid into one fluid, here, christened as
INe fluid, and treat the electrons as the second fluid. It is found that the
process of combining the electrons and the neutrals endows the neutrals with a
negative electric charge. So, here is a new plasma with heavy ( with mass of
the neutral particle assuming the electron mass to be negligible) negatively
charged particles along with the positively charged ions. One could in
principle, similarly treat the second possibility. However , since there can be
a huge variation between the relative masses of the neutrals and the ions, the
system turns out to be more complex and its discussion is deferred until later.
Here, after establishing the framework for the two-fluid ENe-Ion system, the
characteristic electrostatic wave mode of this novel two-fluid plasma is
determined. The wave frequency is found to be a function of the collision
frequencies in addition to the dependence on usual parameters.
